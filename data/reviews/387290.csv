It has won several awards for it's art and music. The entire world is handcrafted and every area has a unique feel to it. You play as Ori, a tiny being in a huge forest. Your task is to restore the elements and restore balance in the forest of Nibel. During your adventure, you will gain abilities and skills that give you access to previously unaccesible locations.\n\nThe game has a unique save-system where you can place a checkpoint ("Soul Link") almost everywhere. Are you stuck? Create more savepoints. Forget to save and die? -- Too bad, you're going to have to do that all over again.\n\nBesides that, the game allows you to pick skills from a skill tree that give you more freedom in how you want to play. Want to explore, pick some of the exploration skills. Need more fire power, pick a damage increasing skill.\n\nThis game is an extended and improved version of Ori and the Blind Forest and is a stand-alone experience. You do not need to play the original game first (the core game is the same).\n\nWhy buy this if you already own Ori and the Blind Forest?\n\n- New abilities that both change how you move around and change combat in a new way.\n- A large, optional, beautifully crafted and varied new area which tells Naru's backstory. You need to backtrack to find it.\n- No more closed-off areas; Spirit Wells can be used to warp across the map and you will have access to every location, even after you finish the main storyline.\n- Difficulty scaling. Was the original game too hard (or too easy)? Try the new 'Easy', 'Hard' and 'Single Life' modes, each with their own leaderboards.\n- Behind the scenes content and concept art!\n- 7 new achievements to get!\n\nLike the original; probably best played with a Xbox 360/One controller, although not impossible to play on kb/m.","April 27","true","16.6"," 251 of 285 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","251","285","8","18"

I'm here to tell you that this game "Ori and the Blind Forest" right here, is wicked sick. You might be thinking "Well dang son, why don't you explain what the heck is so good about it then?" To that I would say "Alright, I hear you loud and clear." So allow me to give you some insight.\n\nLet's start with the obvious stuff; Ori is a game with artistic and musical brilliance overflowing like a backed-up toilet. Just take a dang look at the trailer and bask in its magnificience. The music is incredible. The art style and graphics? Amazing. The animation is fluid and lively like a chunky water-balloon. And the atmosphere? Grade A+ right here, it is DYNAMITE.\n\nAfter watching the trailer and seeing the rave reviews I was already sold on this mastapiece, but what I didn't know was that Ori is a metroidvania style game. I'm a big fan of the genre, but HOO BOY this right here is the cream of the crop ladies and gentlemen. The gameplay progresses nicely and there's plenty of upgrades and abilities to unlock which keeps you always working toward something new to add to your arsenal. Ori also provides PLENTY of interesting scenarios and memorable moments that keep this journey fresh and exciting like a brand new chef salad at your favorite eatery. Excellence all-around folks.\n\nNow onto the flaws. Haha, i'm just kidding, I can't think of any flaws. I'm not saying Ori is PERFECT, but there's nothing that jumps out to me about this game that I would change. It's a real solid example of taste-tested ingredients, an appetizing flavor that draws people in, and a unique blend of professional design that makes Ori a master-level dish that is worth experiencing. My main problem is that the game doesn't go on forever because I would keep playing it.\n\nFor those who played the original version, the Definitive Edition adds a new area, a few new abilities, and some nice changes like being able to warp between locations to make backtracking easier. Basically they took a superb pasta meal and added a dynamic parmeson cheese spread to it, making everything more godlike. For $5, this is a fantastic reason to play it again.\n\nOverall, if Ori and the Blind Forest was a type of dessert, it would likely be a plump little donut with an aggressive frosting style that, upon consumption, turns ordinary civilians into galactic super-humans. Be sure to give it a look. Thank you for reading this review.","May 1","true","13.7"," 96 of 112 people (86%) found this review helpful 58 people found this review funny","86","96","112","58","4"

You know, the type of game where you do a lot of jumping and fighting, unlock abilities and explore a vast (and often coherent) map full of adventure and secrets. Ori and the Blind Forest is, besides being well executed gameplay-wise, not just simply a copy of other titles within the genre. Due to its mind-blowing visuals, amazing soundtrack and great narrative, it offers an experience not easily forgotten. It is most likely one of the most memorable 2d platformers you'll be playing through in recent years (to come).\n\n<<<Story>>>\n\nOn that fateful night ... Following a fierce storm, Ori, a cute little creature connected to the Spirit Tree in the forest of Nibel, is separated from its roots (...). Naru, another strange creature, finds her and cares for her as if it were her own child. They are happy together and mostly pass their days playing, eating and relaxing. Unfortunately, happy stories (as we all know) are bound to end. As the Spirit Tree desperately calls out to Ori, without success, all living beings slowly start to wither and decay. Naru and Ori have a lot of difficulty to survive themselves, so the Spirit Tree shines its light on Ori one last time: this is her chance to aid the mighty Tree and restore the balance in the forest.\n\n<<<Gameplay, fun factor and replayability>>>\n\nOri is an exciting action-platformer that has excellent gameplay: from (wall)jumping, to combat to unlocking new skills and more; the game sure knows how to hit those sweet spots. Whilst playing, you'll also 'level up' regularly, which essentially allows you to spend points in the ability tree. There are 3 branches within this 'tree' that focus on certain/different aspects of the game: the offensive branch, the survival branch and the exploration branch. Whichever abilities you pick highly depend on how you want to play the game. They are not at all mandatory to be able to finish the game, however they certainly do enhance an already great experience and make life that little easier. Not only that, it also gives a sense of progression and rewards you for killing enemies instead of just skipping them.\n\nBesides the purchasable abilities, the game also regularly offers new skills. You know, the ones that you use to explore areas that you couldn't reach yet or to do things that you couldn't do before. These skills range from the simple double jump, to reverting enemy projectiles and others. There are a total of 11 to unlock, which is honestly more than expected. You'll need those skills though, as the game also regularly throws new mechanics your way. This keeps the overall experience fresh throughout the whole adventure: once you seem to have mastered one skill, the game is eager to teach you a new one, which secures a great pacing of 'freshness'.\n\nThe main campaign is 'only' about 8 hours long (depending on how fast you are), but luckily there is some replayability to be found. One can gain some extra playable hours by exploring all of Nibel and looking for every possible secret. In the definitive edition, backtracking is also made easier by being able to teleport using spirit wells, which is another great new feature. When you are done with the main game, have everything at 100%, but still want to keep playing, you could try and take on the ultimate challenge: the so called 'one life mode', which allows you to test your skills and will track how far you've gotten via leaderbords (not recommended for the easily frustrated).\n\nThe game is extremely fun to play through, and that is because it does something really well. And that 'something' is the following: its ability to combine gameplay, visuals, soundtrack and narrative in such a way that is just exceptional. You might even forget what exactly you are playing through now and then as this is not just your average action-platformer. It is a game that'll suck you up and will have you going until the very end: a true atmospheric masterpiece.\n\nAs Ori is a very cute game in both its narrative and visual style, don't be fooled: it is still a Metroidvania title and has some (very) challenging sequences in store, like having to escape an area under time pressure for example. However, something that has changed since the original edition, is that there are difficulties (easy, normal, hard, one life) available now. This is a great upgrade, as it allows for a bigger audience. Whether you're looking for a relaxing atmospheric experience or a super challenging platformer (or both); Ori has it for you.\n\n<<<Controls, graphics and sound>>>\n\nLet's get it over with right away: do yourself a favour and use a controller! Whilst the earlier parts of the game are very doable with m/kb, if you keep using them in the later parts of the game, you'll probably get very frustrated. And this is just not the game that you want ruined by your own frustration. That being said, controls are extremely smooth and responsive. Executing even the tiniest of actions - doing a little bunny hop on vertical walls - is very accurate.\n\nVisually, the game is delicious 2d eye candy, with a very detailed back- and foreground.  Between all the action and adventure, you'll most likely take a little 'break' here and there to enjoy the absolutely stunning environments. Each new environment will surprise you time after time. Many eyegasms will be had. Furthermore, the animations are fluid, detailed and - honestly - even near perfect. Walking through some grass, jumping around, sliding ... Nothing feels weird or clunky. Everything is top notch!\n\nTo top it all of, there is the wonderful soundtrack that shoots the atmosphere to unlimited heights. It sounds as it has been taken directly from a Disney movie.  It is so unbelievably good that it'll take you on an emotional rollercoaster if you let it. It is the kind that will bring you to tears years after playing this gem; a true 'nostalgia pill' if you will.\n\n<<<The verdict>>>\n\nOri is an amazing game that offers just that little extra to stand out between other action-platformers. It is almost a 'crime' not to play it or at least give it a go. Especially with the added difficulties in the definitive edition (alongside with some other useful added features), there is no reason to pass it up anymore. It is a game that has mastered the art of delivering an unforgettable atmospheric experience combined with some exciting action/platforming.  In short: a true gem for nearly everyone!","May 8","true","14.5"," 62 of 64 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","62","64","2","16"

Both games check all the necessary boxes that make a good platform game.\n\nI love Ori and the Blind Forest.\nI love Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition.\n\nHowever I do not think this game is an improvement over the original.\n\n---\n\nLet's start with the improvements.\n\nThe good\nExtra area\nMoon Studios has added an extra area that can be explored at any time. It gives us a little more backstory on the character Naru. The location's design is not only beautiful but also clever in the way it becomes partially explorable at the start but story-acquired abilities are required to progress further.\n\n\nExtra abilities\nWhile I'm not a huge fan of the newly added abilities to Ori's skillset (more on that later) I can't deny that they've been implemented professionally. The animations are smooth, a select few pickups scattered across the map require you to utilize those abilities well in order to obtain said pickups and most impressively they're well balanced.\n\nIt's easy for developers to make a small mistake and accidentally introduce a new ability that actually allows players to sequence break the game to their desire, but in Ori this is thankfully not the case.\n\n(Sequence breaking means progressing through locations and parts of the story in a way that developers did not intend to happen, such as expertly leaping over gaps that were meant to be uncrossable.)\n\n\nFull backtracking support\nFor those completionists out there, Moon Studios has added the ability to fast travel through the map using spirit wells. Additionally, areas that were previously sealed off after completion are now still open in Definitive Edition and after completing the main story you can still open your save to explore Nibel or reach 100% completion.\nIt's a great improvement over the original Ori where you better made sure you didn't miss anything before heading to the exit of a dungeon.\n\n\nDifficulty overhaul\nHaving trouble with some of the game's famous escape sequences? Simply crank that difficulty up to Easy so there'll be a few checkpoints along the way. There's no shame in that.\nAlready completed the game once? It feels like a breeze now, doesn't it? Then perhaps try playing the game on Hard or even One Life difficulty. The difference is rather noticeable and even the most diehard Ori fans will have to admit that it was a lot harder than they expected.\n\n\nThe bad\nExtra area\nAllow me to bring up that extra area again, Black Root Burrows.\nIt's well designed and feels like a natural part of Nibel's map.\n\nHowever it's also incredibly short. 1 hour of extra content? Not even that. It takes around 30 minutes to breeze through this entire extra location.\nAnd finally to top it all off, where's the backstory again?\n\nTo quote the Steam Store description:\n• Discover Naru’s past in two brand new environments.\nThe game promised and the game delivered exactly that. But players surely expected more, right? I won't spoil the whole thing for you here but I can confidently conclude that at the end of Black Root Burrows, the player is left with more questions than answers. There is no emotional reveal. No sad shocker. No twist.\nNothing. The player gets exactly what he started expecting to happen at about halfway through the area and the emotional value to be experienced is zero. No surprises.\n\n\nOverwhelming control scheme\nOri and the Blind Forest was already close to the edge of turning its great gameplay into frustrating gameplay, and I'm afraid Definitive Edition succesfully leaped over said ledge.\n\nThe original game had no rebindable keys. This is a huge problem for PC gamers. I will admit to finding the default control scheme just fine but I reckon there's also a huge amount of players who aren't comfortable with it at all. Left handed gamers, people who prefer ESDF over WASD, etc.\n\nOri and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition has made no effort to fix this. Even in this version you cannot rebind your keys (you can edit your KeyRebindings.txt file but I fear for those unfortunate many who will not discover this method).\n\nThis is already bad on its own, but it gets even worse due to Definitive Edition introducing 2 new abilities to the game. BOTH of which require their own key on the keyboard.\n\nSo yeah. This game that was once considered by many a "simple platformer" now forces you to utilize half your keyboard with no way of rebinding keys. (Again - I'm not considering the KeyRebindings.txt method as an actual part of the game)\n\nSHIFT to glide.\nE to create a soul link.\nCTRL to Dash horizontally.\nHold UP to charge your HORIZONTAL dash. (definitely doesn't feel counterintuitive at all)\nR to use Light Burst. (which you can aim with the ARROW KEYS if you use the full-keyboard control scheme without the mouse, something that is never explained in-game)\n\nIt becomes such a frustrating mess at times. I'm sorry but it really does. In tense moments where you're expected to react quickly it's an infuriating experience to rely on the far too many keys you now require.\n\nTo sum this problem up:\nIt's RIDICULOUS to expect players to use half their keyboard in a simple platform game that DOESN'T even allow them to configure the control scheme.\n\n\nLazy implementation of difficulty\nThe addition of a harder difficulty is nice, but it's implemented in such a dull way that it only makes the game more frustrating.\n\nIf Hard difficulty at all alters the escape sequences in any way, I have not noticed it.\nAs far as I could tell it did absolutely nothing to those scenes (which I consider the highlights of Ori).\nInstead, the only thing Hard difficulty did was add more difficulty to the normal, calmer parts inbetween those sequences that seem a little dull and repetitive in comparison.\n\nIt's the usual difficulty slider like in every other game. All it does is increase the damage taken by enemies.\nIt did a good job at making the biggest part of the game relatively difficult for me but that only made the rare few escape sequences even more disappointing, as these supposedly "hard" sequences were now easier than the rest of the game due to not being affected by the higher difficulty setting at all.\n\n\nThe remaining additions don't excuse this being a whole new game\n\nFrom the short Black Root Burrows to the difficulty slider, none of this feels impressive enough to condone the developers saying "Hey guys I know, let's make a NEW version!"\n\nStuff like the revisiting areas to reach 100% completion should've been part of the core game all along. Definitely not something a player needs to pay for.\n\nThe extra abilities, extra area and difficulty slider... Well, they're nice additions but even when all of them put together I just don't see the reason why this had to become a new game.\nA free update would've been far more appropiate for this amount of new content.\nOr even a cheap DLC, perhaps.\n\nNot a full game.\n\n---\n\nGreat game, but apart from the spirit well teleport mechanic all of its additions could've been implemented better and I personally find this version unnecessarily confusing due to addition of even more required keys to play what used to be a simple platform game.\nI would've worded this summary a little more positive but it seems I reached the word limit.","May 26","false","8.3"," 57 of 76 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","57","76","0","2"

The game features simple but deep gameplay mechanics, a stellar artstyle, and a soundtrack moving enough to bring a man to tears.  If you have not played this game yet, I cannot recommend it enough.  My review, however, mostly regards the Definitive Edition.\n\nFor the time being, owners of the older version have the option to upgrade to the D.E. for five dollars.  The additions include a new area that offers up to an hour of gameplay, a couple new abilities, and a lot of minor tweaks and improvements.  The new area was enjoyable to play through, and was quite diverse as the tone of the game would change as you progress.  I also found the two new abilities to be very useful and made a substantial impact on how I played through the game.\n\nOne downside to these new abilities is that with my increased range of movement, some of the later abilities were less needed when it came to reaching difficult places.  Some of the existing "puzzles" were also changed to incorporate one of the new abilities.  Getting this new powerup, however, is not required to progress through the main story, so those that do not get this ability will have a less enjoyable experience.  I personally liked that there was a substantial reward for exploring and going off the beaten path.  These changes to the puzzles made the game a bit more interesting, as you had to keep an eye out for certain background objects and did something other than pounding on a pole to open a gate.\n\nAnother big change is that the player now has the ability to teleport between spirit portals.  One may think that this breaks up the pace of the game, since you no longer would have to walk through the areas when traversing the map.  However, at most points in the game there were many new collectibles to get when moving between areas.  Additionally, the portals are spaced far enough away that it was often easier just to manually move through the map.  This new feature saved time at a few points where I did not have to backtrack, but did not have any major effect on the way I played the game, so I would say it is an overall positive addition.  The game also now lets you return to areas previously locked off after leaving and lets you return to your save after completing the game, making 100% completions a lot more tolerable to do.\n\nAll-in-all, I thoroughly enjoyed playing through this masterpiece again with the new gameplay and features.  I do wish the D.E. provided more content, considering that upgrading costs money when there are other games that provide more substantial additions for free.  However, I felt the original game was very cheap given the amount of time and enjoyment I got out of it, and the new additions meet the bare minimum required to justify a five dollar cost.\n\nThe Definitive Edition is absolutely an improvement over what was already a phenomenal game, and I would recommend upgrading for those that really enjoyed the original.","May 18","true","11.8"," 24 of 24 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","24","24","0","0"

However, I would recommend the original over the definitive edition. It is my understanding that you get the original when you purchase this version. The original is comparable to Super Metroid in terms of gameplay, collectibles, and backtracking. However, some of this gets lost in translation with the ability to teleport between areas but at the very least you still have to walk between the areas to gather all the collectibles.\n\nThe biggest letdown as the original owner of the first game is having to purchase the definitive edition for $5 for only ~1 hour of bonus content which is just added off to the beaten path and absolutely not required to beat the game. However, to extend the game longer, they "artificially" add length by placing a power up in the game in the new area and changed puzzles to require this powerup to gather collectibles that did not need it prior to the definitive edition.  This breaks the game's pace from the original as there is no reason why it has to have this other than to find something to do with the new powerups.\n\nI would say that this game has the "Other M" syndrome in which the new area requires you to go through the darkness thinking at first I need a powerup to do so. No, you have to suffer walking through the darkness to find this ledge that leads to a ball that gives you light to find the hidden platforms required to beat the area. The issue with this is that typically when I fall down to a pit full of spikes countless times, I would think not to go there until later. Well, you are more than welcome... just a tad bit too the left and a little higher would solve my issue. And then when finishing the new section I almost felt like I did it backwards... but can't really figure out if I did.\n\nIn the end, the new area completely breaks the game's pace at collecting all the collectibles by requiring the player to go off the beaten path to collect an ability that otherwise was not required. Sure the new edition lets you replay certain areas that were not repeatable in the original and lets you teleport between areas, but again, at the cost of breaking the games pace. Piror to the definitive edition everything could be collected before the end of the game without going off the beaten path, however the same puzzles are changed to be solved by collecting a powerup which (again) breaks the game's pace.\n\nI would not recommend getting this if you have the original Ori and the Blind Forest. Divinity: Original Sin added a definitive edition that more than doubled the content of the game for free to all original owners while Ori and the Blind Forest only added ~1 hour of content and hid it away and artificially lengthen the game.\n\nWith that said, I would recommend this game to all new players of Ori and the Blind Forest, but I would recommend playing the original over the Definitive Edition (that is, if you still get the original with the new one). The old one had that "feel" that the Definitive Edition fails to offer with some unnecessary changes.","May 15","false","6.6"," 75 of 128 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","75","128","0","7"

And while on paper it looks all so nice and shiny, reality is slightly different.\nSo, what improvements have I noticed?\n1. New logo in main menu. Yet the desktop shortcut is the same.\n2. Fast travel between fountains! That is handy if you'd like to skip some backtraking.\n3. Difficulty levels. Yes, they're there, but do they make any difference gameplay-wise? In some degree: the higher the difficulty -- the more damage player receives. But don't expect the game to be easy on Easy  -- it is still nearly-dark-souls-difficult with manual & limited saves.\n4. One new area and slightly re-designed sections of the main map. Um, that is a tricky one. A new area is there, it's very cool, quite large and brings two new abilities. Re-designed sections however are not quite "re"-designed -- more like a few extra interactive objects to be activated with the new abilities. Nothing really mind blowing to be honest.\n\n\nOverall all I've seen so far should have been a free patch + a dlc. A few save points during escapes for noobs, fast travel and improved stability (i.e. bug fixes)? Not quite worth of a separate game, besides the original Ori still needs a patch or two to fix crashes. Or is it abandoned now?\nBy the way, that new level is totally missable and is not required to be explored in order to progress. I found it only thanks to the achievements and google. Located to the right from Sunken Glades fountain.\n\nConclusion.\nIf you have played the Original Ori and the Blind Forest and either completed it once and for all or dropped because it was too-damn-difficult for you -- no, don't upgrade. You most likely won't be happy with your investment. Also keep in mind that save files from the original game are not transferable. Actually it reminded me of many other definitive/redux/director's cut paid upgrades..\n\nHowever if you are a new player or want to replay it from the very beginning -- sure, go get it. Because it's still visually astonishing and well desined game. Just a little more polished and patched.\n\nPS Review has been updated on May 11, 2016.","May 8","true","18.0"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","4"

It has some of the most fluid, fun controls and challenges of any game I've played, and it's clear from the start that the people of Moon Studios perfectly understood what they were doing, because everything works masterfully! Simply moving around feels great, and combined with creative environments and obstacles, it adds up to a kind of platforming brilliance that you don't see very often. Despite the structure of the game, I'd argue that it's more Rayman than Metroid, though I strongly recommend it to pretty much anyone who enjoy sidescrollers. It's a game that keeps getting better with every new challenge and every new ability, most of which only enhance the platforming (the bash ability changes everything). It also has the best quicksaving system I've ever seen.\n\nAll of it is wrapped up in a fantastic presentation. The art is detailed and gorgeous, the soundtrack is dramatic and unforgettable, and both compliment each other perfectly, as well as the grand, poetic storytelling that goes all out to make the world feel gigantic and ancient. It seems like the developers only took lessons from the best of the best, and nothing feels underwhelming, cut short or left out in any way. It's all extremely polished.\n\nIt's pretty weird that this Definitive Edition isn't just an update to the original version, because now that game is just taking up space on the store and in my library. There doesn't seem to be any reason to buy it when the DE is the same thing + new levels, new abilities, difficulty settings, fast travel options and full backtracking support (although more graphical options would've been nice as well). Having beaten the old version, all these additions were very notable, very early on, and they only serve to make the game more exciting than ever.\n\nIf you like magic, fun, challenge and feeling emotions, you should pick this up. There has never been a better time to do so.","May 7","true","4.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","0"

You aren't a metroidvania) this one really does fit the genre.\n\nRight away you're gonna notice how god damn beautiful this game looks. It's really pretty, and the animations on Ori and some of the other characters just add to the overall amazing aesthetics. I don't think I've played a game that looks prettier than this. Sure, some games might have better graphics, but they don't look this vibrant and alive.\n\nOkay, anyway. So I said it's a metroidvania, right? It is, but the vast majority of Ori's powers that you will gain as you go through the game are movement based powers. You're not going to find various laser beams like Samus or anything. The gameplay is designed with this in mind, and while there are enemies in the game (they're all pushovers), your real adversary is the environment.\n\nYou'll get real familiar with double jumping up walls, going from side to side avoiding spikes or fireballs, then launching yourself off of enemy projectiles with another movement skill.  They even go as far as to not have actual bosses in the game, at least like you are expecting. What function as bosses are elaborate escape sequences from various areas that will really put your platforming skills to the test.\n\nAside from these new powers you'll find, you can also find the standard things like items that boost your max hp or energy, or give you a free skill point. Yeah, Ori has a skill tree. Well, it's not really a tree. He has three linear paths, each with a different theme. You have to progress down each path in order, but you can hop back and forth between the three as you like. If you put your first point in the combat path, you aren't stuck with that branch only until you complete it. Protip: do the path that ups your movement abilities first. This is much more helpful than combat upgrades. Triple jump anyone? Yes please.\n\nI'm a huge fan of this genre, when it's done right, and this is done pretty damn right. It's not quite on the level of Super Metroid, Symphony of the Night, or Axiom Verge, but it is really close.\n\nOh, did I mention how pretty and cute Ori is? Buy this just to look at him. He's adorable.\n\n...is it even a he? I don't know.","April 30","true","9.1"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","1"

I would definitely recommend playing with a controller the game is extremely difficult even on normal using just the keyboard and mouse.\n\nMy first complaint is the incredible difficulty of certain sequences mostly escape sequences and a few particular levels. I would definitely play the game on a lower difficult and take your time on your first play through as some of the levels have very unique mechanics, the game does a poor job of telling you what they are. It also does an awful job of telling you where to go or how to get there in certain escape sequences. (Looking at you Final Fight Sequence.) As hard as the Ginso Tree escape was I never felt truly lost not knowing where to go, only that I was failing at the escape. Escaping Kuro is a different deal, during the very last stage of her escape I genuinely did not know where to go or how to get there and it took several tries to figure it out, amidst all the fire, falling rocks and Kuro its easy to miss the updraft.\n\nThe second is that the combat mechanics of the game are not fleshed out very well in comparison to games like Metroid, I really feel they developers could have taken a little more time with the combat system. Not only that but the game has very few enemy types, you have a whole forest to work with and there are most likely fewer then ten types of enemies, not including the recolors. I would have liked to see more NPC's as well, deer in the background, schools of fish in the water, life returning to the forest itself as you go on your adventure is pretty obvious but the forest itself still feels pretty empty. Hopefully if this gets a sequel they will take that to heart.","April 30","true","24.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

However, there are a few important things the DE does that I feel improve the original in several welcome ways. And this game always deserves my thumbs up.\n\n* 2 new areas that expand a bit of backstory for a certian character. These areas a beautifully well done and fit right in where they are placed. They also feel unique and have their own mechanics and puzzles built around them in addition to weaving in the new abilities.\n* 2 new abilities, a dash and a "grenade"-like orb, with new skills on the skill tree to improve them. Very fun to use and usefull outside of their obligitory use to get certian collectables. I found that when upgrading the dash to be useable in the air, it was immensely helpful in the escape segments which in turn improved them overall for me. It made them more fluid and fun. I did play the origional nearly 9 months ago so maybe the muscle memory hasnt worn off yet but still, they were welcome additions to further expand the already fun gameplay. The upgrade to make the air-dash an attack was simply ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. My inner Mass Effect Vanguard was giddy as hell using it. A ton of fun and super impactful.\n* Spirit wells are now fast travel points. Allowing you to teleport to any previously used well. Some may complain this takes away some of the backtracking that made the original "feel". But I think it improves the pacing of the game. Exploration fans like me still take time to traverse the scenery and unless you are going for 100% completion from the get go, you arent using these wells terribly often. If you are adverse to fast travel, simply use them as save points and nothing else, it is still possible to beat the game without using the feature.\n* You can now revisit areas that would previously be locked after exploring. A huge plus for me, and made 100% completion more enjoyable. Plus being able to revisit the Ginso Tree was a huge delight.\n* Difficulty options are available. Playing through 3 out of the 4 (the 4th being permadeath); completing the game on normal, I think "Hard" best caputres what the original was all about. But for those more interested in the sights and soundscapees the game provides, the first two difficulties suitably allow others to complete the game with maybe a bit less frustration. You might still snap your keyboard at the escape sections however.\n\nTo adress the cons I had for the original game:\n* Escape sections I feel are more fluid provided you have the new dash ability, more so if you can use it in the air by unlocking the skill from the green skill tree. However they can still be quite trial and error. Even with the difficulty turned onto easy, the following hazards will instant kill you regardless: rising waters, giant falling rocks, lava, large fire balls, lasers, and  Kuro  . That said, the non-lethal hazards are more forgiving and allow more mistakes on these sections. But still be mentally prepared for it. Overall I had a much more enjoyable time with them than the first time, but muscle memory might have stayed with me over the past 9 months.\n* The droning old narrator grew on me. So subjective is still subjective.\n* You can revisit areas previously locked off after exploring.\n* I still think that (Story Spoilers)  the death and eventual ressurection of Naru belittles the impact the scene had and Ori's journey as it is his call to action. I get why Ori was ressurected the first time in the begining. But I think it would have been better to keep Naru dead and try to work those themes in given that situation. I don't have an alternative to offer here but I still feel Naru's ressurection was a bit on the cheep side.   Despite this, I still really enjoyed the emotionally charged storybook narrative the game had.\n\nOverall however, this game has definately improved from the tweeks and additions it had. For 5$ as an owner of the original, it was a no brainer. For new comers, 20$ is still a great price for what you get.\nEasily my favorite game of 2015.","May 22","true","37.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Not only is this game gorgeous articistically, and in particular its soundtrack, it also challenges you. Whether you're playing for 100% completion, deathless victory, stressing through a 3-hour speedrun or just hopping around for your first time, this game provides some unique challenges that flow along beautiful gameplay. This is definitely the best non-Mario platforming game, ever. Get it and play through at least once in your life.\n\nAs far as the Definitive Edition versus the Original, the Definitive Edition offers 2 new abilities which only get truly utilized in one major new area on the map. Without any spoilers, is based around a Naru-centric story which is short but sweet. It can be confusing since rather than adding new challenges in other areas of the map, tney just forced you to get the new abilities to unlock some older ones. The greatest part is that you can get back into all the areas and use waypoints to teleport. This is nice and saves time, though if you're trying to collect all the secrets, you'll still be hoofing through areas a second time when you get triple and charge jumps. It could just be me, but I noticed some lag on the water escape which I never had on the original and shouldn't ever really have. Furthermore, I noticed Steam failed to register my achievements after a while.\n\nIn summary, I loved this game so much that quite honestly I didn't mind any of the shortcomings with the Definitive Edition-specific content, But to be clear, the definitive edition doesn't really add much of anything worthwhile. If you've never played through Ori and Blind Forest, do it. It is fantastic. If you have but are wondering if the Definitive Edition is worth getting... I'd say only as an excuse to play through it again. Keep in mind, that like most platformers, replay value is limited. You can aim for achievements, but despite my love i probably won't play it again for 6 months to a year and soonest. Ori and the Blind Forest is fantastic, and plays really well on both Xbox and Steam controllers, but can be extra challenging on a keyboard thanks to the eventual use of 8 buttons/keys for different purposes. No matter what, this game is worth playing once though. And possibly obsessing over it's soundtrack afterwards. The Definitive Edition could be worth skipping, but let's all just hope we eventually get an Ori sequal at some point.","May 9","true","9.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

However, having played the original Ori, and having had to pay 5€ on top, I was disappointed by this re-release. If I could rate the upgrade separately from the game, I would. But this isn't possible since they decided to re-release the old game, with some content on top, and I mean literally on top:  They just found a location on the map that was still empty, and added the new content there. The devs claim they wanted to integrate the new content in the world we already knew. Nonsense!

When they say "integration into the 'old' world" they mean "we also changed 2 puzzles to make use of the new abilities". And that's it. I was completely disappointed by this upgrade, I was expecting way more for a Definitive Edition that is also a new game on Steam. If they just made it DLC, I would have been fine with it, but this way? No. (Also, the month delay with no communication Microsoft and the devs helped form this review.)","April 27","false","7.5"," 259 of 487 people (53%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","53","259","487","12","44"

With an atmospheric world, fantastic gameplay, tight controls, emotional story-line, and sweeping soundtrack - it's sure to blow away many gamers. Developed by Moon Studios, Ori has back-tracking, puzzles, fast paced combat, and a story-line keeping you from putting down the game.\n\nSimilar Games?\nMetroid Series (Open World and back-tracking elements)\nCastlevania Series (Back-tracking elements and combat)\nThe Legend of Zelda Series (For story-telling and Puzzle Solving)\n\nPlot\nOri and the Blind Forest's story-line is one of the most emotional in 2015's gaming year. With laughs, heart-aches, sadness, fear, and happiness all rolled up into one 2D game, it's one to treasure for awhile. Ori, the last light spirit must go out and return the light lost from a great tree to restore the life of a dying forest and home. Kuro, the main antagonist, keeps Ori at bay as she tries to keep the forst blind and dark. I can't say too much without spoiling the game, but one of Ori's strongest elements is it's story-line.\n\nGameplay & Combat\n**This game is best played with a controller!**\nOri and the Blind Forest has fast paced gameplay and combat. SImilar to Super Metroid's gameplay, you will have Ori jumping around the map as you explore the giant world, Nibel. Gracefully jumping and wall climbing, Ori is a very fast and flexible character.\n\nFast gameplay and movement requires fast combat as-well - Ori is occompanied by Sein, the light needed to bring back life to the forest of Nibel. Sein follows Ori and discharges light that act as attacks - get near an enemy and rapidly tap the attack button and it will damage the foe. It's not just repeated tapping to defeat an enemy, you can charge up Sein, dash through enemies, and even smash into the ground as Ori. Combat is fast, satisfying, and addictive - though it's repetitive, you'll be gliding by enemies and still want to take them down.\n\nOri and the Blind Forest also includes a level-up system in which you pick up light orbs that act as experience points. Gather enough and you level up and get to unlock a new ability off of your skill tree. The skill tree comes in three different categories; combat, efficiency, and utility. Each unlocks a brand new ability that greatly improves (and changes) your gameplay and the way you handle enemies and the world around you.\n\nVisuals & Sound\nBy far the most impressive and best qualities of this game are the Visuals and Soundtrack. The art direction and graphics put into this game are outstanding. Each area, each screen, and each "dungeon" are created in such a gorgeous and creative way that will leave you awe-struck. Made with Unity, this game is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played.\n\nBeing the most beautiful game ever, it's also one of the most pleasureable games to hear. It's soundtrack has memorable tunes and sweeping large action songs that will make you want to download the soundtrack once you are done playing. The soundtrack is my favorite aspect of this game and while you won't hear grand orchestra music, you'll hear wonderful simplicity that stems from the theme of the game and the area/situation you find yourself in.\n\nVerdict\nOri and the Blind Forest was my favorite game of 2015 and the Definitive Edition breathes in new skills and light into the wonderful game. After playing through the story-line multiple times, downloaded and listened to the soundtrack countless of times, and achieved every achievement, I can say that this is a must own game. Beautifully crafted, wonderfully sounding, fantastic gameplay and combat, and an impresive story-line makes for a game that you need in your library. While it is a short game (first playthrough will run you about 5 hours or less), it's a must own for any gamer that enjoys exploration, fast paced action, beautiful story telling and visuals, and a fantastic score. The game is not perfect, as it does suffer from some uneven difficulty (the game can get pretty difficult pretty fast), it's still a wonderful game. It has a unique save system as-well as you get to save at any point, anywhere in the map with the expense of some of your "energy". This allows for unique strategies and save points depending on what you feel is going to happen or what you may have failed at.\n\nOverall, you should get this game. Fantastic game and one of my favorites for a long time to come.\n\nPros\n+ Fast Paced Gameplay\n+ Addictive Combat\n+ Lots of exploration/back-tracking\n+ Fantastic Visuals and Sound\n+ Emotional Story-Line\n\nCons\n- Can get difficult fast\n- Short Game\n\n9.8/10","May 4","true","9.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I kind-of wish you needed the two new abilities for the main progression, but the new lore, art, and music just completely overshadows that. The addition of Dash made getting around much easier, and Light Burst made arial combat much smoother. Some sequences were made easier because of them, but the game overall is still balls-hard unless you're familiar with it, especially on hard. The abilities and the new sections' content make visiting them so, so satisfying. Lots of bugs were fixed and the renderer was improved as well. I also like that the Genso tree can be revisited, but with a clean look. No wonder this thing too so long. I wish there was a secret at the top tho.\nHopefully if there is a sequel, it will put this game to shame, but I honestly wouldn't mind if there wasn't because of just how complete this game feels.\n\nRead my review of the rest of the game, the original content, here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tycho_Brahe/recommended/261570/\n\n\nTBH I don't mind paying an extra 5$ - I think MS and Moon are under-selling themselves by not pricing this at 25$.\nMy only beef is that you still can't remap controls >.>.\n\n\nNoteable changes:\n*The oneshot energy cell in Misty Woods has been moved to a different region\n*All temples can be revisited; however, for Forlorn Ruins you will need to activate the Spirit Well\n*Superjump no longer makes you invuln\n*The red energy/stone things' beam gun is no longer instagib\n*The acid roller things are no longer instagib (still do a TON of damage, even with Ultra Defense)\n*The airjets during the Forlorn Ruins escape sequence are no longer instagib\n*Some spikes do more damage than before\n*You can now revisit a completed game (until you 100% it?)\n\nMechanics changes:\n*Bash damage upgrade has been replaced with Charge Dash\n*Bash no longer does damage to airborne enemies unless you smash them into something - useful for speedrunning\n*Charge Dash has more range, targets enemies - denoted by a blue aura, and does tons of damage (can absolutely RIP AND TEAR into one of those slime monsters)\n*Charge Dash can reflect projectiles that Bash works on\n*Charge Dash can be used immediately after a Superjump\n*Charge Dash is useable immedately after hitting LT\n*Spacejump and Dash recharge when you ride air currents.\n*Ori has a serious arm on him and can hit foes with the Grena- I mean Light Burst with pinpoint accuracy\n*You can quick-toss Light Burst in the air to clear out things in front of you that Spirit Flame won't reach\n*You cannot Bash off air-thrown Light Burst\n\n\nBtw nice subtle Transitor reference with the beach room.","May 3","true","16.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

MORE Ori and the Blind Forest? Sign me up yes please.\n\nSo when it came out on Steam, I immediately bought it. I got a discount because of owning the original game, so it was a lot cheaper than I expected, but it was worth every penny and more. New powers, new areas, new skills to play with and new achievements, new story, new music, new art assets. The new powers are so much fun and really wonderfully placed in the world, requiring them to unlock stuff in the main game as well as the expanded area without being dickish about it.\n\nAnd yes, I did cry my eyes out again, at all the same places, and at the new places where it was relevent. The new content is fantastic, and the game runs smooth as silk still. It's even got less falling through the world bugs! Which is fantastic The men and women of Moon Studios have clearly been very hard at work and deserve every bit of credit they recieve for this masterpiece.\n\nSo yes, if you haven't already got Ori and the Blind Forest, get this one.

The artwork and direction almost feels like a movie at certain points, and at no point does the game seem rushed or overly simplified in aesthetic or level design. The abilities you collect throughout the game are all used in ways that make them feel unique and add to the experience, with none of them ever feeling like they were shoehorned in for a false sense of 'new' content that is used for only a specific section. Each level is extremely fun and new thanks to how well the introduction of new abilities ties into them, resulting in very satisfying gameplay where you actually feel like you are getting better at controlling Ori and your abilities.\n\nThe only issue I have with the game is the overall difficulty. The game is a little too easy. I enjoy the platforming and how each ability presents a new way to play the game, but it's almost like you just have too many options in terms of movement, and that your mistakes really aren't punished very much by the game in part caused by the ability to save frequently during a level. A lot of people also complain that the game is too hard though, but I think that too many people try to brute force their way through a game without actually getting comfortable with the game's mechanics. However, it doesn't really matter, either way you look at the difficulty, too hard or too easy, it doesn't distract from the strengths of the game, the way that each level seems fresh and new, the artwork and amazing soundtrack, overall a solid 10/10.","May 9","true","9.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I've got a kinda messily organized review pre-DE.\n\nTo start, I'd say the upgrade to Definitive Edition was easily worth the $5 is cost me, and now I'll get into why I think that.\n\nPretty much everything I said before still applies to now*, but I'll update on whatever they added while trying not to spoil much. (*lots and lots of bugs were fixed.)\n\nFrom what I can see, they've added 2-3 new abilities, 2-3 new areas, some lore, and full backtracking via the save shrines (I don't know what they're called)\n\nI think they've easily expanded upon the game by around 1/3 with this expansion, and they make use of the new backtracking.*   (*which is entirely optional; you can still just play through the game normally; but this is a god-send if you're looking to find all the secrets and explore 100%, etc.)\n\nThis game hits a niche of mine super well, which is being an original platformer.   I love games like VVVVVV and similar, but I'm starting to see this overwhelming flood of "2D pixel indie hardmode" platformers that also generally try to incorperate roguelike (or, in other terms, >SKILLS<) or RPG elements; which are usually very bland and predictable and often feel more like a poor reason to just grind out the achievements for the game (i.e., MAXIMIZE CHARACTER DAMAGE (which can mean taking an entire dedicated run or replay over the course of a whole day) )\n\nThe thing I love about Ori and the Blind Forest is that it reminds me of games like Yoshi's Story, Metroid, Dust: An Elysian Tail, etc.; the only genre I probably enjoy playing more than this is 3D Platformer Adventure, which is probably one of the most dead genres past the early 2000s.\n__________________________\n\nTL;DR, for $20, I'd recommend Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition any day; and I absolutely 100% recommend upgrading from the standard game if you can get it while the $5 deal for previous owners is still active.\n\nNOTE: And for the like <0.1% of us out there, they added native support for 21:9 resolutions.","May 9","true","3.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Another is the final run from Kuro.\n\nIf there is anything negative I can say about the game, it would  be during those moments where dying over and over again somewhat detracts from the story as it's unfolding in chaos around you.\n\nI tried to complete the game 100%, but apparently I missed something somewhere as I was only able to hit 99%.

It was an instant buy when I read about the improvements and expansion on the original game - I didn't even hesitate for a second to click the "Add to Cart" button.\n\nOn to the review itself... Ori and the Blind Forest has rekindled my love for gaming. Having grown up in arguably the heyday of PC platforming games with Commander Keen series, Duke Nukem I and II, Flashback and Blackthorne among those I remember fondly, I always yearned to relive those fun memories. I tried several modern 2D and 2.5D platformers over the years and the only one that oozed the atmosphere I sought was Knytt. After reading the experiences from several gamers last year, I decided to buy Ori and the Blind Forest during a Steam sale, not expecting too much...\n\n...and boy was I blown away! From the opening sequence, right through to the conclusion of the game, I was absolutely mesmerised. The controls are tight, the soundtrack fits the mood and action on screen perfectly, the sound design is spot on and the art is, well, just that: an absolute work of art. If I could frame this game and hang it above my fireplace I would. Mind you, I have a 48" TV hanging above my fireplace, so I might as well put Ori on an infinite loop on it and bask in its beauty.\n\nMany people have lamented the difficulty of the game, but I believe it to be spot on. As frustrating as some of the escape sequences in the game might be, they are utterly rewarding and the calmness that follows after each of those sequences hasn't been matched in any other game yet. This game has truly a therapeutic element to it, especially after you finished the game and unlocked all the areas and most of the abilities. Going back to previous areas will be a lot easier and allow you to just take in the backdrops and appreciate the small details, like the grass waving as Ori runs over it.\n\nEveryone should experience this game. Just buy it already.","April 28","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I myself am not a platform-game player, but I LOVED this game.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nI don't know what, but it did miss something.\nThe combination of all abilities was downright amazing, after unlocking most of the abilities, you will like the game even more because everything start to be fast-paced and you completely own most enemies.\n\nStory: 8.5/10\nIt sure was a good story, there are better ones of course, but this one was very good.\n\nChallenge: 8.5/10\nThis game was the best love-hate relationship I've ever had in my entire life.\nI loved it so much, but at some moments it was such a pain in the ♥♥♥♥.\nAlso the One-Life difficulty is very refreshing but frustrating.\n\nSoundtracks: 9/10\nThese were absolutely gorgeous!\n\nGraphics: 7.5/10\nThe game looked very nice and fitted perfectly with the gameplay.\n\nOverall: 9/10\nVery much recommended game overall and I really suggest you to pick it up if you're in for a challenge with a good storyline attached to it.\n\nI do wish there was a multiplayer mode in the game where you could just play the game, but with a (or multiple) friend(s). It would be even better if the devs pulled it off like in Portal 2, whereas in co-op mode you actually needed a friend to open up a door, etc.","May 6","true","45.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The new areas are a lot of fun, and they add even more to the already sad/tragic story.  This game finally dethrones Super Metroid as the best 2D Metroidvania game.  It is definitely on the difficult side, if you aren't very good at platform games this may not be your thing.  Unlike similar games like Guacamelee though, this game is exploration/platforming focused and not combat focused, so there aren't lots of combos...attacking things is one button and very simple (which is the way I like it in a Metroidvania).  The new easy difficulty for beginners should help with the issue the original game had of being very difficult if you aren't basically an expert at Metroidvania/platform games, so...even if you aren't an expert at platform games it's still worth a try.  All in all, this makes an already amazing game even better, and I can't recommend it enough.  I think this game is worth easily double what they are asking for it, and it already has my vote for GOTY 2016.","April 27","true","8.6"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

They could have done without the 2D-like 3D graphics (the developers render the 2D sprites in a 3D environment) and simply use actualy 2D, which can be just as beautiful (look at Rayman Legends), but less heavy on computers.\n\nNow for the main game itself:\nFirst, the game looks beautiful (do I even need to tell that)? Lots of detail in here, and great use of lighting. Probably the most beautiful 2D game there is. The only thing I don't like about the graphics is the stuff I mentioned above.\n\nThe controls are great. They feel natural and clean. The Wall-Jump ability is more like a Wall-Climb, but I think it works much better than the Wall-Jumps we've seen in other platformers.\n\nI also like the skills available in the skill tree. Many skill trees nowadays are just 'Lives+10, Lives+50, Attack+20, Attack+70". This tree, however, has many unique abilities that all really help against the challenges you encounter in the Forest of Nibel.\n\nSpeaking of challenges: I can't really speak for them, as I'm playing on Easy mode. On Easy, I think the difficulty is fair enough, although most enemies are really fast. Sometimes, it is hard to react to those sudden assaults. Sometimes, I also get the idea it's hard to see whenever you're touching an enemy or not. Some enemy particles are really small, and hard to see.\n\nI think the music in this game is nice, if not a bit forgettable. It fits perfectly in this game, but most songs (except for the intro song, which I feel is a bit overdone) are best when they're just background music for this game. Nothing really stands out.\n\nThe story isn't that interesting, but the way the game actually TELLS the story is amazing. The graphical effects that accompany the various cutscenes are perfect well-done and makes the game feel more of a beautiful theater play, rather than a realistic story.\n\nI do recommend this game. Though there are a few drawbacks, most of the game is a treat to play through.","April 27","true","1.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","192"

This edition fixes them all, and more.\n\nI won't recap everything I said last time but to summarize, its beautiful, sounds amazing, is perfectly responsive and intuitive, and is overall one of the best 'Metroidvania' games, and with the extra polish honestly I'd wedge it just up above shadow complex, and below the ultimate, SOTN.\n\nSuffice to say, you should play it.  Be prepared for the insta-kill escape sequences, be prepared for some pretty epic exploring, but most of all be prepared to sit back and just enjoy everything.\n\n","May 3","true","15.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The art is beautiful, the music is charming and enjoyable and the gameplay is fun. The definitive edition makes some good steps forward, removing all the points of no return that existed in the original, and even added the unnecessary ability to teleport between spirit wells.\n\nIf you're new to Ori, then I can't recommend picking this up enough. It's fantastic and more than worth the investment. I personally recommend starting with the original, as I feel it paces itself better and is all around a more enjoyable experience despite the points of no return.\n\nIf you're a prior owner of Ori, I would say that the new content is probably worth $5 for most of you, though I can definitely understand why some people would be disappointed. There are 2 new abilities for Ori (ignoring the passive skill tree), 1 new environment where you learn about Naru's past, and the above mentioned spirit well teleport and removal of points of no return. It's not insignificant, but perhaps not as much as the description might lead you to believe.\n\nHighly recommended if you've never played, hesitant recommendation for prior owners until the discount expires.","May 18","true","6.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There is no real one way to do something and especially now that the definitive addition added those two new spells, the game allows you to make your own decision to reach somewhere. The background music is amazing and when you reach certain levels they can either take on a very fast pace or a very relax feel. The enemies each have their own feel and way of dispatching. I have achieved every achievement aside from beating the game on hard and on one life, but I know for a fact that I will complete them both no matter how long it takes because this game has rooted onto me and I enjoy every second that I've played it. It would make the perfect gift for anyone who enjoys a simple story loaded with emotion and fun puzzles with a hint of danger added by environmental traps and unique enemies.","May 8","true","19.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badweatherforcast/recommended/387290/","badweatherforcast","badweatherforcast","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badweatherforcast/","9 products in account","Ori and the Blind Forest is a wonderful game. An INCREDIBLE game, in almost every way. Satisfying, enjoyable, astounding, dazzling in both graphics, style, gameplay, story and even music, it's no wonder Moon Studios has won so many awards for their beautiful game.\n\nThere are several ways you could describe Ori, if you'd dare. You could call it awesome. You could call it unbelievable. Some might call it frustrating. What ever you may call it, it deserves all the recognition it gets.\n\nPut into the role of an orphaned Guardian Spirit, you must face the merciless and fateful forest of Nibel in its terrifying blindness, to which you must restore the weakened light to. A series of unfortunate events prior to the forest's decay sets Ori on a dangerous path, causing the Spirit Tree, the reason to all Nibel's life, to lose his power. With the guidance of the mystical creature Sein and the bravery to outmaneuver the antagonist Kuro, Ori is Nibel's last hope, a hope that must shine above all else, or the world will never live again.\n\nWhat I've given you is a mere taste of this inspiring tale of hope and self-discovery; the longer version is something you will have to find for yourself. It probably has one of the best plots I have ever come across in a video game especially, and it only continues to compliment every other attribute of Ori and the Blind Forest. I found the story to be bittersweet, filled with action, thought-provoking, and beautiful in more than one way.\n\nThe artwork in Ori and the Blind Forest is altogether breathtaking. I knew, as soon as I saw it, I wanted to immerse myself in the world this game presented. And when once I did... well, let's just say it took forever to get myself out of it. The painted style of Ori and the Blind Forest is something I rarely see in such games, or if I have, it isn't executed nearly as well. The graphics in this game are what initially sold it for me, and as I played, they just complimented everything else even more.\n\nHowever, Ori isn't just a pretty face- that is important in many cases, but what I'm about to talk about is the GAMEPLAY. Oh, my gosh. Where do I even begin? The mechanics in this game are genius, especially with such a spry and lithe being such as Ori. Everything from the jumps, to the dashing, to the wall climb... they are all fluid, just meant for Ori's agile form. It never once felt too slow or too laggy, and none of the mechanics felt out of place (even the newer ones, which I thoroughly enjoyed).\n\nAm I done? NOPE. There is more still, and that is the MUSIC. The score in this game has enchanted me for the longest time. Sometimes, I'll just put my controller down, slap on my headset and listen for minutes at a time. The effort Moon Studios put into making the music a fantastical experience clearly showed in this fantastic score. The music could go from soft, to loud, to tense, to sad, all with excellent transitions. The music always felt right, and that's the best anybody can do.\n\nI've played the original Ori and the Blind Forest before the Definitive Edition was released, but I will also be reviewing the DE as well. I loved every second of Ori and the Blind Forest, and hearing about the expansion made me buzz with excitement. The thought of returning to the world I loved so much, with even more content and artwork, was like a dream come true. After playing it through again with the DE installed, I realized I had almost forgotten how incredible this game really is. The additional areas and the added backstory with Naru made me appreciate her character perhaps even more so than I did before, and I loved leaping and flipping through the newly painted areas.\n\nThe areas, nor the added story, nor the new mechanics seemed out of place to me. That was one of my main concerns when I started playing, that it wouldn't fit with the overall game and dampen my opinion on it. But no, this was not the case even a little. In fact, I think it made me appreciate it MORE.\n\nI'd like to mention quickly that there are a few small things; when I played Ori originally, I would encounter a few bugs, and I have found some here and there in the DE as well. But they haven't really changed anything for me; I understand that a game isn't without its few imperfections. There will be bugs.\n\nSo, am I recommending this game to you? YES. YA. SI. If you haven't noticed already, I have a high opinion of Ori and the Blind Forest. 9.8/10, I believe should be fitting. Thank you, Moon Studios, for sharing this incredible creation with us.

It is also one of the best platformers.  Coming from the SNES, where almost all platformers have no saving, playing this was awesome and not at all frustrating.  Because you can load from save points, the game can introduce puzzles that would set you back days, weeks, months, or forever in a traditional platformer.","May 26","true","26.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

No, really. Even Bobby Kotick would not have invented a more profitable business scheme. "What kind of business model" - you ask? Well, for stupid people who do not understand the economy, I answer:\nAlmost without adding anything new developers attracted to the game and get the attention of new customers + 25% of price of the game from old customers + soundtrack DLC + T-shirts, socks, hats, cases for iPhones, notepads, mugs, "artworks" (average price 20-40 $ (proofs: http://i.imgur.com/49lqdAz.png   http://i.imgur.com/RU1s3u2.png   http://i.imgur.com/gF6Webb.png   )) =  additional tens of millions dollars profits.\nQuestions to the developers: What are you going to sell next? Shampoos, children's chancellery, dishes... or immediately pornographic cartoons? Are you going to start a franchise? Kids cafe, for example.\nI do not know what to add more. Oh yeah, I'll add a final question for the readers!\nWho of these people was the most greedy in world history:\nA) Judas Iscariot (he betrayed Jesus for money);\nB) Francisco Pizarro (he killed millions of people and destroyed the Inca empire for money);\nC) Cecil John Rhodes (he unleashed a war against the Boers and created the first concentration camps for money);\nD) Moon Studios (they destroyed their own game and sold souls to the microsoft devil for money).\nAnswers write in comments!\n\nUPD: I saw no one correct answer in the comments (probably due to high complexity of the issue).

The fact that it comes with such beauty is a must have, especially if you love platformers.\nIt comes with the original too, for those who are looking at it and don't yet have either games.\nFor everybody looking to purchase it, those who have it and those who don't, it comes with the free extra content of the new/unreleased tracks, concept art, concept for enemies, interactions, and cutscenes. Asides from the original soundtrack, all the bonus content is included already. If you feel like you want to play the original to get the hang of the abilites besides the new ones, you can play through the original. Everything is beautiful.\n\nMy only complaint with the whole thing was that the new content isn't really a big part of the story. You could go for it if you wanted to have 100% completion on everything, or if you wanted the two new abilites. Other than that, it's not really part of the story, making it just put in there for the new content. I would have liked an upgrade to the story, but looking back it would probably seem just as out of place as this spot atm.

I own the original "Ori" and did not hesitate to acquire the "Definitive Version", I now have two variations of this legendary game.  Make no mistake, this is a future classic and it will take years for any studio to surpass the love that has gone into making Ori what it is, something very special indeed.\nGraphics, sound, playability, those are the magic ingredients that make a computer game, but Ori has more than just those things, Ori is filled with a "unique something" that words cannot or ever would define.  This title is so good that every single person should own a copy.  Moon Studios have created a game that truly deserves a place in history and in your hard drive.

The biggest issues I had with the original was being unable to 100% the game because certain areas were locked off after you completed them, but now that issue is fixed as you can teleport to any Spirit Well. Other additions such as the new areas, more achievements, and more movement options are also nice to see, and, as a big surprise to me, this version of Ori runs much faster on my not so great computer than the original version does. I will write a longer review later on the game as a whole, after I've finished this version, but I can easily say that it's worth the $5 sale now to get this one over the original Ori.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/silverlife/recommended/387290/","silverlife","Silver Aura","http://steamcommunity.com/id/silverlife/","242 products in account","The Definitive Edition is exactly what I needed to get back into this game. It still remains one of the few games I can almost always go back to and get lost in. Absolutely beautiful, remarkably fun, and the new content is definitely worth the additional $5 for anyone wondering if they should upgrade.\n\nFor folks new to the game, unless this kind of game is a complete and total turnoff to you, there's next to absolutely no reason not to experience it. Especially for the ridiculously fair price they're asking for. Don't wait for it to go on sale, support this amazing piece of work at face value. It's a purchase you wont regret, I can assure you.\n\nOne of the defining factors behind what makes the game so fun is the level of trust it has in you to grasp concepts and quickly. You'll very quickly be given new abilities which rapidly ramp up how quickly and creatively you can navigate the world, but the game is fully aware of your new capabilities and almost instantly puts them to the test. There's no hand holding. Once you get out of an area with a new ability, you've basically reassured the game that you understand the mechanics and are effectively forced to become adept at it. In a very good, rewarding way.\n\nThrow into this the traditional "metrovania" style of exploring and you'll find yourself actively revisiting locations to test out your new abilities and find new secrets. At the same time, you'll feel the strength of your new abilities as you soar through areas once tricky to navigate. It's a rewarding sense of progress that isn't measured in purely in numbers, but by your ability to build upon what you knew before, with entirely new powers.\n\nYou'll also figure out just how layered your powers can be as you experiment with them. While there's no explicit chaining, you'll find yourself pulling of combinations of moves that have a certain degree of synergy about them. It's fun, but above all, it's satisfying.\n\nOn the basis of being fair, there are a few little nitpicks. Take them with a grain of salt:\nEnemy variety can get stale after the first half of the game when you realize that most of the enemies become stronger versions of the same enemies from earlier. More health, more damage output, minor aesthetic changes. I would have liked to see as much seemingly limitless creativity with the enemies as the environments they're in.\nDifficulty is hardly anything to complain about, however it should be noted that this game is notoriously difficult. It's not unfair and feels rewarding when you do get the flow of things. Fortunately they've added some additional difficulty modes to make it more accessible for people looking to play primarily for the atmosphere and amazing gameplay. Do not play hard mode if it's your first go though. In my experience, it's little more than a damage buff that results in almost everything killing you in one or two hits. It's good for a challenge, but hold off until you understand the mechanics a bit better.\nThe story was beautifully told, however without spoiling any major details, I feel like some events in the game might have had more overall impact if it had stuck with them rather than going for a near universally happy ending.\n","May 12","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's beautiful to look at, it's invigorating to play, and I guarantee you it will be one of the best - if not THE best - platformers you'll ever play with a heart warming story to boot.\n\nThe jumps in this game just FEEL right. The air time feels good, and can be slightly controlled by how long you hold the jump button. The travel distance in each jump also feels accurate and fair, and even though some of the levels will take time to adjust to you can look at the scene and just tell what needs to be done most of the time, it just takes timing.\n\nAbilities, and the ability tree also are interesting and fun. I'd like to talk about them more but I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say that one in particular was extremely satisfying to use throughout the entire game. The ability tree feels impactful, but not so much that you feel like you miss out by going down one path too much, plus exp points can kind of be farmed if you really want every thing unlocked.\n\nPacing of this game did feel like it sped up a bit much at times, like it would be fairly casual going through a level with a bit of tension on landing on certain platforms and then all of a sudden there's just a rushing, climactic moment that occurs, but it luckily saves the game before each of these scenes so all is good. For the most part you can easily predict when the speed-run moments are about to occur, and with a little preperation -and a few retries for me- your gold.\n\nThe story is what really keeps you playing though. The stunning drawn backgrounds, sprites, effects, sounds, and characters on top of the gameplay will make you WANT to get through this game so badly to see what happens next, and it definitely has replay value if only to relive those warm moments. I can definitely see now why this was deemed a "new classic".","May 13","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The leveling seems to be a bit of an illusion as I usually can only level one thing due to prerequisites. Perhaps those who don't search every crevice might actually have to choose perks. I have already experience one interesting mechanic where platforms appear or don't appear depending upon whether they are in the radius of a glowing ball that you can carry. While I die a lot, I never feels stuck.

The second is based around the new abilities you get in the area, and introducing the new mechanics is handled well.\n\n2. New abilities. Dash and Light Orb. The dash makes movement a lot faster and probably pleases the hell out of speedrunners. The light orb is fun because you can use it to break a lot of the jumping puzzles once you get bash, and some secrets were edited to be behind doors you have to open with the light orb, I'm pretty okay with that.\n\n3. Warping between save points. In case the dash didn't already make things fast enough.\n\n4. You can backtrack now. No more replaying the entire game because of one missed collectible.\n\n5.

So I would still 100% recommend this game.\n\nI enjoyed the stuff that was added, like the new storyline, the teleporting, and the difficulty option. But I played the original game first, so there are a few problems that I have with the new changes. One is the inability to change the graphics, which is not really new, but it's a problem. When I got to the deepest part of the new area, it lagged pretty badly, more than any other area.\n\nAnother problem I have is that the new stuff doesn't really do anything for the main story. I mean, I loved it all, but it just felt like some optional mission. I hoped it would have a big part in the main story, like maybe throughout the main areas of the game you see new content that relates to the new story or something. Or maybe some of the newer areas connect to other areas that you need to go to, and more of the story is discovered there. Either of these were what I was expecting before this was released, and was somewhat disappointed. It's just one new area by itself. With the stomp ability, you could get through all the new content in just half an hour. Then back to the main story, which is still exactly the same.\n\nAnd as for the new abilities, one of them was severely useless. The "Dash" ability was rather pointless throughout the entirety of the main game. They should have added more situations where you would really need to use it. But you only need it in the new area, and that's it. If they wanted to add a new storyline to the game in the fashion that they did, it should have just been released as DLC or something.\n\nBut still, this game is definitely worth getting, with all the beautiful visuals and soundtrack. If you don't already have it, please, buy it.","May 7","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Both are the same game, but this version comes with two new areas to explore and two new skills to play with.\n\nFor those who have the original and are trying to decide whether to buy the Definitive Edition:  It's the same game, aside from those two afore mentioned additions, so it depends on how much you love Ori.  For me, I REALLY love Ori, and so paying the sale price of 5$ was absolutely worth it.\n\nFor those who are trying to decide whether to buy any version at all, here's my review copied from the original:\n\nOri and the Blind Forest is an excellent game with scenes that will definitely tug on your heart strings. The visuals are breathtaking, and the level designs are quite good.\n\nIt's a metroidvania with a heavy emphasis on platforming action rather than combat, although fighting enemies is still a significant part of the game as well. How does it emphasize platforming, then? The biggest example of this is that there are no boss fights, but rather boss quality platforming challenges that require quick reflexes, good timing, and will absolutely get your heart pumping! I mean this literally. After the first of these, my heart was racing at twice its resting rate.\n\nThe story is short, as is to be expected of this type of game, but the depth and emotional impact is solid. It's very rarely that I've felt an antagonist to be fully justified in everything they have done to our hero, yet still known that I must stop them anyway.\n\nTruly an excellent game.

From a visual standpoint it's absolutely gorgeous. The world is highly detailed and graphically impressive, with some beautiful artistic design in some areas. Most areas feel a bit bland and generic, but there is certainly a lot of variety in locations. Each area usually takes advantage of a certain skill Ori has recently aquired and contains a sizable number of secrets. Ori herself moves very fluidly and has a variety of moves and skills she can aquire over the course of the game, not too many, not too little. The leveling system is fair, although a majority of the points you get are just tucked away in secret areas, meaning you can get a lot of skills very early. This brings me to one of my biggest complaints, the secrets. Ori is very limited in terms of the secrets you can find, with the majority of them just being orbs that give you some points. They're also quite few and far between. Compared to other games, such as Castlevania, Metroid, Guacamelee, at least. Enemy designs I find are also lacking. I can only remember 5 enemy types. Basic enemy, dino thing, bird, orb shooter, and fish. This is part of what I mean by it feeling generic, it hits a lot of notes that many other games hit, as well as having designs that aren't very unique. But, if you just want a fun gameplay experience with beautiful visuals and fast, fluid movement, you'll like it. I certainly did.","May 31","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was thinking the same about the original release, now I am convinced entirely, yes Ori indeed is an art piece, which you could purchase and play on steam!\nThe soundtrack is one of the most touching and beautiful soundtrack I've heard in years in any game or actually anything else.\nAnd the story is so moving and well written, I am literally holding myself to not to give spoilers and ruin the fun for the gamers who missed the opportunity to play this masterpiece.\nIf you are in a position that, you couldn't be sure that if you'd enjoy this game or if it would be money well spent, trust me you won't regret even one single second that you bought this game and played it (and if you're like me you'll probably finish is countless times, just to see that amazing athmosphere and colors and well designed characters.)\nSo just stop thinking and go and buy this game, you'd be thankful.","May 28","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only thing I had any issue with was the length, it felt a bit short but i also havent tried to get 100% on everything yet. End Verdict: This is game is worth every penny.","June 1","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jagerofelements/recommended/387290/","jagerofelements","Saul | APP","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jagerofelements/","131 products in account","After a 100% run of this game in 11.5 hours, I must say Ori and The Blind Forest: Definitive Edition is worth every penny.\nNote: If you buy this game, know that you will have this version and the old version in your library. You do not need the old version to play and running the old version, at least in my case, crashes. Anyway, back to the review.\n\nEverything to the opening cutscene to the final scene, this game is full of emotions, beautiful art style, and challenging platforming. Ori and the Blind Forest takes place within an interesting place where the darkness has taken over the light, also why it's called the Blind Forest. It is your job to repair the three elements so that you can return the light.\n\nThe game is mostly platforming but is filled with enemies along the way. You will fight many enemies and use them in interesting puzzles to make your way from location to location. But don't think it's just fighting and platforming, oh no there is more! There is an OPTIONAL skill tree that can make the game easier as you gain EXP.\n\nBut you don't only gain EXP from enemies, you can gain it through one of the three types of collectables. Yeah, there are collectables and many of them are hidden. If you want to 100% the game, you better travel to old areas where collectables weren't accessable earlier in the game. Oh but don't worry, you can use one of your skills to show collectables on the map. ;D\n\nFinally I will take about powerups. Throughout the game, there are powerups that you gain that helps you enter areas once unreachable. You gain the ability to reach new areas, new secrets, and push further into the game. The powerups require skill but not enough to the point you have to do near impossible feats.\n\nI will end this review with my only complaints being 1) the game is short. Short in the fact that I want MORE! The game was amazing, and I would love for a sequel. 2) There are NO epic boss fights. Yeah there is combat but it's with a miniboss you see three times and only with the small guys. But since this game is platforming, you end the game with platforming. I won't ruin the surprise, but I definitely recommend playing this all the way through.\n\nOri and the Blind Forest is an experience, an experience I would love to experience again. Now... Sequel please!!!","June 6","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wish they would release a patch in order to solve this since it is very frustrating in the end.\n\nSome of the controllers for playing could be improved -- the Bash ability can take some time to get used to.\n\n(These last 2 points were the reason why I didn't give this game 5/5)\n\nDespite this, I loved this game and I hope Moon Studios keep up the good work and provide us with even better games in the future.","June 6","true","28.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember seeing the trailer before getting Steam and wanting the game. When I finally did get Steam on my computer, Ori was the first game I bought.\n\nThe art is beautiful, the music is beautiful, the story is interesting, and the gameplay is fun with just the right amount of challenge.\n\nIf you like exploration, platforming, and puzzles - this game is for you.\nIf you like games that are visually stunning and atmospheric - this game is for you.\nIf you like games with great soundtracks - this game is for you.\n\nMy favorite part of Ori is that it is so immersive. The world of Nibel is beautifully constructed and every area, though each unique, flow together really well. I really enjoyed running from one end of the map to the next to experience the music shifts and the colors switch tone.\n\nI've spent 30 hours playing the original game and around 20 hours playing the definitive edition, and I feel like each of those hours are worth the $20 cost of the game. (Or $5 if you own the original!)\n\nThis game pulls you in, and makes you think. It can be relaxing and fun at one time and challenging and intense the next. The balance between the two is so well done. I can't reccommend this game enough. If you have any interest at all, I say take the plunge...you won't regret it!\n\n\n","June 6","true","23.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
