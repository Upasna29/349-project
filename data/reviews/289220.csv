Game looks like it has potential, if you like the old graphic style of games like the Gothic Series, The Guild etc..., But sadly, I cannot recommend this game, even at a lowly $4, since you will most likely never get to play it. At least not on a modern machine.","April 23, 2014","false","0.7"," 95 of 114 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","95","114","0","0"

Well, it would be if this game wasn't the bug-filled mess that it is. Enemies ALWAYS get back up and fight after keeling over (making kill quests unplayable), getting stuck on stairs due to buggy path finding, and poor Russian to English translation make this boring fetch-quest simulator a total waste of time and money. Ditch this ugly, dated mess and save your money for a better game.","May 13, 2014","false","5.4"," 39 of 49 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","39","49","0","0"

Like Aidyn, it manages to balance between half-baked and brilliant, like the devs knew their game was flawed and ran with it.\nThe writing is a mixture between epic and carefree and doesn't bother with ye olde-speak.\nLikewise, the world this is set in doesn't rely on medieval or futuristic presets, Kammir is a deliberately vague place bringing different ages and styles together. It's refreshingly unorthodox.\n\nGraphics are angular and certainly "ugly", but there is something delightfully garish about them, deep blue skyboxes, super green grass, vistas that can't be fully categorized.\nSame goes for the music. It doesn't even try to be tasteful and sometimes veers into almost comical caroling synthesizer lines. I love it.\n\nThe battles are standard mouse-driven realtime fare. So far they have been bland, lots of clicking, not very responsive. You get to acquire different party members that act by themselves, but can be given behaviour rules for battle.\n\nOne thing that is really bothersome is that your character often gets stuck on stairs, again, lots of clicking and wriggling needed.\n\nIf you have a heart for mentally handicapped, but cute games, give this one a shot!\nDon't forget to install the patch which is available on the forums. Without it, BorderZone tends to crash or freeze.","July 24, 2014","true","11.3"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","25","35","0","0"

I turned off the Music and set Compatiblity Mode to XP SP3, did not crash after the changes. I played for 27 min. trying to get the player up and down some stairs in the first building I entered. The Player Character is stuck on the landing, acts like the stairs are an obstacle. Took 10 mins of finagling to get him up the stairs and still got stuck coming down, I finally gave up. I will be deleting the game. Do not waste your money, unless you want to play a buggy game in silence and don't want to search upstairs.\n\nUpdate to Review 09/21/2014\n\nNew Update to BorderZone: There may be hope after all. I am going to try another go.\n\nI installed and ran BorderZone again today. First I configed the video from Steam>SteamApp>Common>BorderZone>Config. Choose resolution (1600x900) on (Laptop Win7 64 pro) and raised some effects. Ran the game and all was well, no crashes, sound, higher resolutions and wide screen. I went straight to the stairs in the Blacksmith building that gave me all the grief the fist time around. Player Character ran up the stairs like a champ. Vast improvement, very happy with the update.\n\nI have changed my rating to thumbs up. The game is worth a play through if you are into reto RPGs. The combat is a little stiff and limited. I have put a few more hours offline into the game than is expressed in time played. The options in combat are opening up. Pick it up on sale.","April 23, 2014","true","4.6"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

It even supports more modern resolutions now.\n\nI tried BorderZone despite the endless amount of negative reviews because I wanted to experience the gameplay for myself. I gave the game a chance, I really, really did.\n\nIf you like RPGs and action adventure games, you will probably still dislike this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are lacking - the character models and detail in the backgrounds are weak and bland. The different armor and weapon types available, however, will actually appear on your characters - which is something I appreciate. The music is easily the best part of the game, but it fails to carry the experience into a positive one.\n\nThe controls are a bit sluggish, and there is no tutorial to guide you through the game mechanics. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with action RPGs. You will probably spend a bit of time trying to understand how the menus (especially the inventory management) work, and the interfaces are not very ergonomic. One of the most annoying things for me is the lack of feedback regarding item stats - I end up swapping shields based on what looks cooler, since I have no idea which one is actually better stat-wise.\n\nBoth combat and dialogues are lackluster - I played around with the character creation mode, hoping that different specializations would alter my gameplay a bit, however, I was always disappointed regardless of the character I rolled/made. You also are not given much feedback if you choose to make your own character from scratch.\n\nHonestly, I would strongly recommend you invest your time somewhere else, as this game fails to compete with most alternatives. I also strongly advised against the game Space Hack (to which I received a lot of negative reception), however, I would even encourage people to waste their time playing that game before trying BorderZone.\n\nEven after the patch, the game remains fairly buggy, and is prone to crashes. Would suggest staying away, unless you are able to get this for free.\n\nDO NOT recommend.","July 23, 2014","false","10.8"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"
