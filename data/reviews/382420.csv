A simple, standard FPS with a normal "War Sucks" message, regenerating health, and guns with genuine feedback. Using cover is required, but instead of a pre-rendered cover system, you must actually use POSITIONING and TERRAIN.\n\nWhile there are a few problems with invisible walls over low obstacles, generally the game is good about making the staircases easily visible. For an indie-game on sale for $12? More than worth the price. As an added bonus, the translated voice acting lends a sense of charm to the entire game, and the visual designs, while pretty generic, are generally colorful enough to prevent boredom, and the environments, while bland, typically make sure everything important is vibrantly colored. All in all, I'd say this is an above average game, and that I look forward to more from this developer.","March 4","true","2.5"," 48 of 60 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","48","60","2","0"

It’s a fun ride but you shouldn’t expect COD here. It’s an indie FPS game with small price. It is well made in my opinion though and I didn’t face any issue. I played a half of story (I guess) and I must say the game play was pretty smooth. I also played lots of multiplayer with my friend so far; if you have bunch of friends to create a server and join together its loads of fun.\nIn the end, I think it’s worth the price and I enjoyed my time with it.","March 7","true","16.3"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","27","35","0","0"

(especially indoor places).places like this: https://imgur.com/J4AWoRB for me is kind of superb,lots of nice feeling in it.\n\nThere could be some kind of slow motion system in this game something like what we've seen in fear games.\n\nAnd about the audio effects,it's not dated or something like that but it makes me feel that i'm under the water and enemy just keep shooting at me from outside.and it's one of weakest parts of the game.\n\ngameplay and gunplay,both of them is smooth and nice but sometimes your running to an enemy for close attack or better shooting and then starting to shoot but you will find that your bullets have no effect to the enemy and for some reason there is no melee attack in single player and in that case you just have to die ! (it's the same in multiplayer mode and sometimes bullets have no effect to the enemy especially from close distance)\n\nAnd about the enemy,wish there was some kind of big as& robot in game,that could be way better idea than spamming lots of drones around the player and could result lots of epic battles.and enemy bullets have a bit high damage to player especially according the number of enemy that exist at one place and in most of times you don't have that freedom to run between stuff and you just have to find a cover to stay at.\n\nand about the multiplayer,it's really fun to play and maybe the best part of the game but wish there was some kind music in maps cause it's makes me feel that i'm just running in a dead place especially with that weird (enemy) weapon sounds.and sniper should have some kind of effect (after shot) at this moment it just making lots of campers in the game and that's not good at least for a dead match mode.\n\n","March 8","true","7.9"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","27","37","2","0"

Armies is futuristic FPS with both single and multiplayer.\nSingle-player offers medium length campaign full with up's and down's, how's that?!\n\nWell for start graphic ambiente is great, weapons designs also badass, music is also cool, but as a result of probably low development budget following stuff are not awful but very bad;\nOverall sound effects, voice acting, NPC reactions and behavior (maybe the most stupid npc's I ever encounter) and explosion animations.\nStory such as remind of old classic games, you are a badass dude going yolo killing and demolishing everything in his path. Also another annoying thing is that you do actualy have jump/space button, but you cant jump over anything that is higher than 20cm XD\n\nI can't speak of multiplayer because whenever I tried playing it servers were empty, I do hope so that it is more fun than single-player.

There is definitely passion and a concept but the execution leaves me wanting to play better shooters. And I think that's the one thing this game does so wrong, it's presentation just feels cheap.\n\nThe sound effects sound muffled or that they came from an early 2000's shooter. The voice acting is hilarious and your character's catchphrase seems to be "Yes Boss." Just the things the characters say in this game are uncomfortable and unnatural. For example, HQ or headquarters is called headquarter in this game and responses to questions don't sound right. Now the voice acting can probably be attributed to the script which I don't believe has translated very well from the original language to English. You'll also notice that there are grammatical errors all over the place ingame.\n\nFurthermore, he gameplay feels slow and a bit uncomfortable. A good comparison would be how the Starship Troopers shooter was, it feels out of date despite the fact that it's a new game. It's almost like the whole game is just missing that fine polish that one would expect from a modern day shooter. Maybe I'm just spoiled by all the big budget shooters we have now-a-days but there are still indie shooters I would recommend over this one. Insurgency, for example. Control is tight, guns feel meaty and effective in that game. They don't here.\n\nOn the plus side, the graphics aren't half bad. There is some tearing here or there with a really weird haze that surrounds items sometimes but for the most part the game looks competent.\n\nIn summation, save your cash. While not a terrible shooter, it's not a very good one and there are far better games on the market for the same price or less.\n\nGameplay Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMCbMNauio","March 3","false","0.8"," 59 of 104 people (57%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","57","59","104","10","6"

Armies is quite a great indie shooter that shows us perfectly that game being independent, doesn't mean it has to be bad. Game is taking place in a sci-fi futuristic world and you're a soldier on a mission to rise and defend it as good as you can. No, it doesn't live up to some amazing AAA shooter, but you will be positively surpriced what indie developers are capable of.\n\nAdvantages\nGraphics are polished and gorgeous, lots of of lightning and reflections do their job perfectly\nStory is mantained on an interesting level for most of the time\nWell made shooting mechanics\nMultiplayer differs from singleplayer and it's really, really fun with all those addons like drones, spaceships, radar etc.\nDandy design of weapons and maps\nDisadvantages\nAI is terribly stupid, enemies see you through walls and obstacles and your allies doesn't help at all\nWorld is closed by invisible walls everywhere\nMusic is very repetitive, sounds and voicing are poor and dialogues looks like written by a 14 years old boy\nMultiplayer needs some development and publicity around as now it's completely dead\nPrice tag is too high for what the game offers\nSummary\nGame is good yet not outstanding. The idea of singleplayer is to run from point to point, killing waves of enemies that are spawning around you, but it's demanding and fun so that's something. Multiplayer is surprisingly good, I got to play with 4 other people in room and it was nice until I noticed that everyone camps with snipers. Kill streak rewards are also a nice addition to it. Except graphics, nothing really in this game is worth those 15 euro so it's too much in my opinion, but if you will get it at discount or bundled, totally worth trying out. But still, really good job devs, hope I'll get to play something from you in near future.\n\nPersonal score\n7 / 10\nIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!","March 11","true","7.1"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","18","29","0","0"

Its essentially a "B" grade sci-fi FPS. its story driven. Feels so much like bulletstorm without the whip to me. It uses the UE3(DX9.0C), so of course its going to look and feel dated. And that being said, changing resolutions in windows10 may kill your game. Its not a bug thing, its a DX9 in windows10 thing.  I love games like this, but trust me its not for everyone. Its not a AAA title and it doesn't try to be. Its a cheesy somewhat entertaining FPS, its not deep. The game puts good use of PhysX, lots of dust, particles and stuff, almost a bit too much honestly. The enemies are a tad bland, but still fun to mow down. Back in 2009 I would have given it an 7.5/10, but in 2015 its a 6.5/10. If you love "B" grade sci-fi, its a yay, if not, its a nay!

Armies is an action-packed, fast-paced, science-fiction first person shooter. The game takes place in a dystopian future in which Earth’s resources have been depleted. Abandoning the planet seemed to be the only avenue for survival but not all could leave. Those left behind have become united in their struggle. It’s just the beginning for the Forsaken and the start of their devastating plan for vengeance. The Forsaken hungers for supremacy and power in equal measures and war is its lifeblood.\n\nAs a Parsis soldier you are charged to resist this new power and defend the fragile landscape against the Forsaken’s ruthless onslaught. Along the way you’ll face more strife than you could have possibly expected, together with your allies you must fight to cleanse the land from the Forsaken’s brutality.\n","April 26","true","0.4"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197975580504/recommended/382420/","76561197975580504","Mostly Harmless","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197975580504/","627 products in account","E.T. Armies is a sci-fi themed military First Person Shooter by a small Iranian studio, made in Unreal Engine 4. It's clearly not a triple-A title, but does show a solid degree of polish and professionalism; there are actual production values behind it, and it's not just a student programming project made by one or two dudes in their bedrooms (like a lot of First Person games on Steam these days). I'd say it's comparable in quality to other studio-developed "Euro" FPS games on Steam, like Alien Rage, Alpha Prime, Chaser, Chrome, Bet on Soldier, Exodus from the Earth, S.T.A.L.K.E.R., Ubersoldier, etc (although the graphics are more modern than most of those games, which were made in the late 2000's).\n\nGenerally, the game plays like a typical modern shooter; you have regenerating health and can survive a reasonable but not overwhelming amount of gunfire, can carry 2 swappable weapons plus a backup pistol, can throw grenades, enemies generally take 4 to 6 bullets of automatic weapons fire to kill depending on weapon, etc. The one caveat is that movement speed feels somewhat slow (if anyone remembers Unreal 2, that's how slow you move in this game), although you can sprint to move somewhat faster. There's no inventory management; your ammo is restored to full at ammo boxes spaced periodically throughout the levels, although if you're using enemy weapons you need to pick up dropped weapons to refill ammo instead. Overall, the gameplay and animations are a little stiff compared to an AAA release (or even something like the Metro series), but there are no glaring bugs or  major frustrations.\n\nThe Unreal Engine 4 graphics are very nice and up to modern standards (though not quite the bleeding edge photorealism of a AAA title), as previously stated the game has actual production values behind it and the graphics are a lot better than other UDK games on Steam that were made by one or two people. The only thing that looks a few years dated are the character faces, and even those are OK. However most of the levels after the first one are somewhat disappointing in terms of art style, as they all take place inside a generic sci-fi factory-type setting.\n\nLevel progression is very linear (no sidepaths and no exploration), although the levels themselves can be very large in scale. The game has about 6 levels, with each level taking about 20-30 minutes to finish. Overall, the game can be finished in a little over 2 hours, which combined with the very basic small-scale plot and abrupt ending are probably the biggest weakness of the game.\n\nThe story is surprisingly small-scale, and focuses on a single mission (to retake/destroy a power plant taken over by enemy soldiers) during a larger war between the Parsis (colonists who fled Earth after a global nuclear war) and the Forsaken (humans who were left behind on post-apocalyptic Earth). There are a couple hints of a larger plot (your character makes note of strange ruins in the desert, abnormal weather, and the Forsaken being more technologically advanced than they should be), but these plot threads never add up to anything concrete, and the game ends abruptly with you simply blowing up the enemy base. Overall the plot feels like the first act in a 3 act storyline (i.e. the Modern Warfare games), which makes it seem the Devs ran out of time/money and could only put out the first act.\n\nThe cutscenes and dialogue are probably the weakest part of the overall presentation. Characters are reasonably animated in cutscenes, although animation appears non-mocapped and seems on par with a mid-2000's game. However, dialogue isn't lip-synced well and the dialogue itself is pretty poor (you can tell it was translated from a non-English script, if you've played games like Chaser, Alpha Prime, or Bet on Soldier you'll be familiar with this). It's not "Master of Unlocking" bad, the dialogue IS coherent, but there's just something "off" about it that makes it clear it was translated. Still, since the plot itself is so basic this doesn't really hurt that much.\n\nWeapon variety is pretty basic. There are 3 assault rifles (the Parsis assault rifle, the Forsaken assault rifle, and a stronger elite Forsaken assault rifle that can be picked up in the later levels), a high-caliber pistol, a shotgun, and a sniper rifle. Guns have a decent amount of recoil and your aim jumps when firing, so you don't have laser-like accuracy even when Aiming Down Sights; at the same time you're still pretty accurate when hip-firing or running-and-gunning, unlike say Call of Duty. Hip fire is accurate enough for normal combat, though you do need to aim to be accurate enough to get headshots.\n\nEnemy variety is also basic; you have a standard soldier, an elite soldier with a better rifle and more health (who looks EXACTLY like the regular soldier except for a slightly different-color uniform; camo grey instead of black), a close-range shotgunner, and a sniper. There are also wall turrets, 2 different types of flying drone (one type has somewhat more health than the other), and an enemy aircraft that can only be killed with mounted turrets or special laser-targeter binoculars that take time to recharge. Enemy durability is on par with games like Killzone or the F.E.A.R. series, with enemies dying after 6 shots from the Parsis rifle, 4 shots from the Forsaken rifle, or 3 shots from the heavy assault rifle or pistol. Headshots from any weapon are an instant kill.\n\nGenerally, the enemy A.I. and animations are also very basic. Enemies often stand or crouch in one spot while firing, they do slowly strafe left or right when shot at, and do make some usage of cover. I'd say the A.I. and animation quality is comparable to other "Euro" FPS games (Bet On Soldier, Chaser, Chrome, Ubersoldier, etc). The enemy animations are functional, though they do have a certain stiffness to them (I'd say it's comparable to the animations of the human enemies in the first Borderlands game). Enemies have a fairly basic animation/move set and aren't as fluid as in games like Call of Duty, F.E.A.R., Rage, Far Cry, Borderlands 2, etc. There are a couple nice touches though, such as enemies stumbling or doubling over when shot.\n\nI've heard there were some issues with rebinding keys, invert mouse, etc, but all of that seems to have been addressed and the game now has all the standard options you'd expect in a professional studio release.\n\nOverall, if you play budget/Indie FPS titles and don't mind the basic, even truncated plot, you might give E.T. Armies a try.  It's pretty generic and basic, but it's also competently made. If you generally stick to AAA releases, though, you might want to skip it.","May 11","true","4.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

It's all on rails and it doesn't try to hide it. It's not all bad, far from it, but it has its flaws..\n\nVideo Review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGHzHlwxdXs\n\nBreaking it down:\nthe On Rails doesn't detract from the enjoyable gunplay, the amazing graphics and pretty good animations... but it does make me feel sad i cant run around as i'd like and am instead fighting enemies by the wave. And while the enemies have sufficient variety (for an 15$ indie game), the Ai of both Allies and enemies is probably the games weakest part. the UI though does a great job of conveying all information you need to have, so you never feel lost or unsure what is going on. spot on there.\n\n...though that weak Ai might contests with the story and it's myrad of gaping plotholes. nothing really gets cleared up or resolved... at all! really frustrating for a story that was looking to start really interesting in the half of the game, but just gets thrown out the window in the last three missions.\n\nOveral, i have to say that if you ignore the story, the gunplay feels great. I especially love the sniper riffle and will have fond memories of it for many games to come. A criticism i will level at the game regarding the gunplay is the limited number of guns.\n\nfinally, i have been unable to test the multiplayer due to a lack of players in the pre release version, and i hope the actual release has that covered, because you will not get the replay value you might want from the story mode.","March 3","true","12.5"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","16","33","0","0"

After getting into the game for only a few minutes, I can tell you gamers that it's not worth playing at this moment.\n\nThe graphic is moderate, but doesn't quite fit our gaming era's standard, especially for FPS type. The voice acting is terrible, especially for the character we're playing as who I don't know for some reason sounded like an office jockey by the way of him refering to his superior as 'boss' all the time - "Yes boss." "Ok boss." "Sure boss.", it gets annoying honestly.\n\nAnd as a shooter game coming out at 2016, I'm surprised that there's no ragdoll physic in the game, only boring death animation with the corpses disappearing seconds after the enemy's death which brings me to the AI for the enemies - their strategy of combating the player is to literally fire indiscrimnately while not bothering to take cover. They just stood there, fire at the protagonist... moved a few steps, then fire again - the cycle repeats. It felt like I'm combating AIs from 90's and early 2000s video games.\n\nThis game needs a lot more work into it.
