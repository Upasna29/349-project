But thanks to a really good optional hint system, everyone can play and enjoy this game.\n\nYou have to place direction tiles on a platform so that when blocks move over it, they will go the direction you want, so they can reach their finish. But you only have a limited amount of tiles, so you need to think it through as to where to place them. On top of that you need to be careful as to not make blocks collide into each other.\n\nThe game starts with a bunch of easy levels, which will give you an idea whether this game is for you or not. The harder levels can become quite a challenge, and especially the hidden levels and secret Portal levels can take up a nice bit of your brain power.","August 17, 2013","true","13.1"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nBnBB/recommended/38720/","nBnBB","[nBn] Beebs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nBnBB/","175 products in account","From the same developers as Toki Tori, their talent with creating tricky but doable puzzles is still readily apparent. I am not at all a fan of puzzle games as I get frustrated very quickly, so the fact I finished this one is probably everything a fan of the genre needs to know.\n\nGameplay is deceptively simple- use redirectional tiles to guide a series of coloured blocks home. If you've seen the trailer, you already know everything you need to know in order to start playing. The layouts are fiendish though, and tease you with making it very clear what you HAVE to do, but keeping HOW to do it closely guarded. Many of the puzzles are forehead-slappingly clear once you figure it out, but until you get to that point you'll be dazed and confused trying to figure out how you're supposed to get THIS block over THERE with two Turn Left tiles and a Stop tile.\n\nUnfortunately the hardest levels tend to devolve into a confusing mess of tiles and blocks everywhere- while earlier levels it was clear where you were going wrong, later levels are so tightly packed it can be hard to figure out exactly what the problem with your solution is. However, the powerful in-built Hint system is tremendously helpful in untying these knots, and perhaps borders on being TOO helpful if you allow it to be- one button tells you if the tiles you have placed should be where they are or not, the other reveals the correct location of every tile you have (but not while tile to put in that place). With trial and error these hints can pretty much solve the puzzle for you, so stay strong-willed and only use it when you're completely against the wall!","November 11, 2014","true","9.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Really? Why? Not sure. I'm assuming just to make a quick 10$.\n\nI managed to get around 80% of the achievement so, i'm not to sad. but believe me, i would get the two i'm missing in a heartbeat if i could.\n\nOne thing i loved about the game was that it refferenced other games, like Portal 2 (Glados) and Toki Torri. (I think...) but i think it's awesome that the developpers do that in games. It gies my a smile. because i loved the Portal seris.\n\nAnyway. I 100% percent recommend this game!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Slug_Overdose/recommended/38720/","Slug_Overdose","Slug_Overdose","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Slug_Overdose/","121 products in account","I bought this game on sale for very cheap, and while I can't say it's not worth what I paid, because it most certainly is, I just think there was a lot of wasted potential here. The thing is, puzzles in general can be very fun and rewarding, or very frustrating. I think the main thing that makes a puzzle frustrating is when you simply don't have enough information to solve it. Sure, it's a valuable life skill to be able to solve problems even when you don't have all the tools, but those kinds of problems are supposed to give you real life rewards, not present themselves as games and take your money.\n\nMy biggest complaint about this game is that it relies heavily on things it never gives you a chance to understand, particularly timing. Many of the puzzles are very simple in a spatial sense, but require timing movements exactly so that you can interweave block paths. However, the game doesn't let you change the speed of the runs, and it's not consistent between different runs. Furthermore, some of the harder puzzles have blocks traveling at different speeds.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, it seems the game doesn't even judge collisions based on a notion of which block occupies which tile, but rather it actually uses hit detection, so blocks entering and leaving a tile at about the same time can still collide by touching corners for a split second. This makes some of the puzzles unnecessarily trial-and-error in nature, with the player just switching blocks around between multiple nearly identical solutions in spatial terms which result in slightly different timing, in the hopes that one of them will eventually produce the correct result. A good puzzle game shouldn't be designed to make you just randomly try things until one works.\n\nAnother complain I have is that there's no ability to zoom the camera in or out as far as I can tell. You can rotate the camera, but the level of zoom is consistently too close or far to clearly see all of the map. The game would've also benefitted from a square lense (orthogonal view if I remember correctly from 3D modeling) rather than an eye-type lense, because several of the puzzles have you dropping blocks from one platform down to another below it, and trying to line up the camera from above to see what will happen isn't very effective.\n\n\n\nAll in all, it's an interesting concept for a game that had potential, but it feels like it was developed to work against you and force you into trial-and-error runs rather than actually thinking about space and time in discrete units with well-defined, known rates of movement. This game could've been more fun in 2D 20 years ago. I found myself using the hints (which make it way too easy) and trial-and-error to solve the harder puzzles, because it didn't even feel like cheating when that's about what I would do without the hints anyway.","December 20, 2014","false","4.6"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

Red cubes have to be guided from the red spawn to the red exit point, blue cubes .. etc. You have a certain amount of placeable objects in each level to solve the puzzle. There are objects like a stop sign, where the cubes will pause their movement for a second or arrow signs, where the cubes will change their direction. The level will fail, if one the cubes falls of the platform, cubes will crash together or cubes won't get to the right exit.\n\nPros:\n+ Easy to get into.\n+ Nice soundtrack.\n+ Three different chapters of difficulty and one bonus chapter.\n+ Tutorial chapter. (Not really needed except the fact that cubes at walls will turn 90° to the right.)\n+ Hint system for inexperienced gamers. (I never used this option.)\n(+ nice to see cubes rolling to their designated point like a working machine)\n(+ downloadable demo)\n(+ steam achievements)\n\nCons:\n- You can't speed up the rolling sequence of the cubes.\n- You can't zoom with the camera.\n- You can't hide planes of the platform!!! (Some levels are cramped and you have to adjust the camera like crazy!)\n- There are always to much cubes that will spawn. (I don't know why the devs have implemented so much spawning cubes for the levels. It would be enough if there would spawn 4 cubes of each colour.)\n\nRecommended, but only if it's on sale, because of the short game duration, the small amount of levels, the easy difficulty and of the (IMHO) annoying cons.\n\n@Devs: One good patch that would patch the cons would rise the rating enormous.\n\n@Gamers: Play the game 'EDGE' (same dev studio) it's definitely much better than 'RUSH'.\n\n6.5/10","September 2, 2015","true","6.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Red cubes have to be guided from the red spawn to the red exit point, blue cubes .. etc. You have a certain amount of placeable objects in each level to solve the puzzle. There are objects like a stop sign, where the cubes will pause their movement for a second or arrow signs, where the cubes will change their direction. The level will fail, if one the cubes falls of the platform, cubes will crash together or cubes won't get to the right exit.\n\nPros:\n+ Easy to get into.\n+ Nice soundtrack.\n+ Three different chapters of difficulty and one bonus chapter.\n+ Tutorial chapter. (Not really needed except the fact that cubes at walls will turn 90° to the right.)\n+ Hint system for inexperienced gamers. (I never used this option.)\n(+ nice to see cubes rolling to their designated point like a working machine)\n(+ downloadable demo)\n(+ steam achievements)\n\nCons:\n- You can't speed up the rolling sequence of the cubes.\n- You can't zoom with the camera.\n- You can't hide planes of the platform!!! (Some levels are cramped and you have to adjust the camera like crazy!)\n- There are always to much cubes that will spawn. (I don't know why the devs have implemented so much spawning cubes for the levels. It would be enough if there would spawn 4 cubes of each colour.)\n\nRecommended, but only if it's on sale, because of the short game duration, the small amount of levels, the easy difficulty and of the (IMHO) annoying cons.\n\n@Devs: One good patch that would patch the cons would rise the rating enormous.\n\n@Gamers: Play the game 'EDGE' (same dev studio) it's definitely much better than 'RUSH'.\n\n6.5/10","September 2, 2015","true","6.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Avetixz/recommended/38720/","Avetixz","Avetixz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Avetixz/","192 products in account","RUSH is a 3D indie puzzle game by Two Tribes[twotribes.com]. It's their second Windows release after the successful Toki Tori. In RUSH, the player needs to guide colored cubes to the appropriate exit points. This happens by using items that are unlocked through the progress of the game, such as Conveyor belts, Warps and more. The player places the items in advance and needs to imagine how they will affect the cubes' process through the level.\n\nI don't have much to say against this game, just one suggestion: a level editor would be great. After completing this game once, I have nothing more to do and there's no motivation for me to play it anymore. If there was an option to download community-created levels (for example through the Steam Workshop) and designing own levels, it would definitely raise the replay potential for me and probably many other players.\n\nOther than that, this game has great, tricky levels, for those who want a challenge, or if you want to set your mind at ease or are just stuck at one level for a while, there's a hint system that makes your life easier. The environment looks neat and clean, which contributes to the game's calming and relaxing feel along with a chill music and simple drag and drop controls. Everything about this game says "No rush." (such irony). On a gameplay level, I like the idea of the game, it's really simple but they did a good job implementing it, the levels have interesting and creative patterns, the items used to control the cubes are decent.\n\nOverall I'd recommend this game if you're a puzzle game fanatic or if you just want a calming game to free your mind. If you're none of these two, you might not have as much fun with the game as I did, but it's worth a try.","February 9, 2014","true","5.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The only gripe I have is the difficulty. Easy is exactly as it says it is, Medium is a little harder and Hard is for when you want to feel like a dumb ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The jump in difficulty from medium to hard is disappointingly gargantuan, going from a little challenging to frustratingly confusing. The artificial difficulty lies in the very specific tile placement needed to beat the levels and the little to no clues to help you decipher the solution. Even when you figure out the trick to beating a level, fidgeting with the tiles to find the ONE solution it asks for is somehow both simultaneously boring and frustrating. I felt very disappointed in myself for having to use the hint system, but unless you want to move tiles around aimlessly for hours you're going to have to use and abuse it to win. Simply put, hard difficulty is not fun and felt more like a chore than anything else. However, in the 3 or 4 hours it takes to beat the easy and medium stages, I would recommend picking up this game only if it is heavily discounted. Not worth a whole $5 in my eyes.","May 16, 2015","false","8.8"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","0"

There's colored entrances and exits, and as soon as you believe you've finished the puzzle, blocks will teleport into existence and follow a straight line across the map, only turning right when they bump into walls.\n\nYou, as the player, have to place special movement pads on the ground that influence the path these blocks take, allowing you to divert block traffic to help all of them reach the exit without colliding or falling off the map.\n\nWhile this premise sounds really simple, in practice it can get really complex because of this simplicity. There's 4 direction changing pads, a direction switcher that switches back and forth when blocks use it. A pause pad, as well as a conveyor belt pad. While their effects are simple, it's the entire contraption and combination of switching and redirecting traffic at the right place that turns out to be the big puzzling question in this game.\n\nThe game divides the puzzles in a few difficulty settings, starting with tutorial/easy puzzles that only involve a few pads, up to hard and 'special' puzzles that require great insights and rational systematic analysis of the paths the cubes take to find out the solution. As such, pretty much anyone should be able to get *something* out of this game, and the more you practice, the better you'll get, allowing even the weaker puzzle fanatic to grow and progress to the harder areas of the game.\n\nRUSH also features a slightly upbeat ambient track that is fun to listen to, and it really fits with the sounds of blocks squeaking their way throughout the level.\n\nSo if you like puzzles, if you like 3d puzzles, if you like logical thinking.

The goal of each level one is to plan routes for cubes from spawning point to exit. Every cube has color and it has to hit exit with matching color, otherwise it keeps rolling. The player has bunch of signs, which he can place around level. Signs have different effects, e. g. changes direction of cube, stops cube for a moment, splits stream of cubes... It may sounds boring, but it isn't.\n\nMajor drawback with many puzzle games is, that difficulty is sets to extreme, or that they are way too easy. This game hits the sweet spot. Levels are challenging, but not too hard. It even has very clever hint system. So, when you are stuck, it won't spoil entire solution at once. Instead it shows you just mistakes.\n\nIn my opinion, there are just two problems. First is repetitive music. After while I just turn it off, it makes me headache. Second is design of some levels.

Initial this is a very simple task but as you get further through the levels it takes a lot of thinking, many runs through to see how the cubes behave (especially when crossing each others paths) and altering your approach bit by bit until it's perfect.\n\nDespite the difficulty later on, this game never really gets frustrating and continues to be a pleasure to play.","June 28, 2015","true","1.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

I thought, since it was there for a bargain.\n\nAnd I wasn't dissapointed!\n\nNow, let's get to the game itself.\n\nThe goal is to lead the boxes (orange, purple, green, blue, red,  I hope I have mentioned all colors now!) to their dedicated (same colored) destination.\n\nTo achieve this, you have a certain number of "direction markers" (among other things) you can place on the field, like arrows that show the direction where it will lead each box that touches it. You can place these direction markers on any spot you like, just make sure you are placing them on the right position so the cubes reach their correct destination.\n\nOh, and these markers are limited, depening on the level/area. And it's not allowed to let the cubes bump against each other...or let them fall off the field. With logic, you'll make it.\n\nK, now to the music:\n\nI like it. it's some ambient electro stuff, and matching very well to the game.\n\nSo yeah, I started it, played the training and finished some "beginner" levels so far.\n\nSince it's a nice looking and fun game, I'll keep playing it more often.\n\nYou should get this game too if you like logical games or want to have something to play & relax!\n\nOh, the animations are nice too. You can move the camera around, so you have a nice overview.\n\nUnfotunately, I didn't see any option where I could have set the speed of the boxes (I can be such an impatient person, no matter how nice the cube animations are in this game). Anyway, I like it so I recommend this game.\n\n","June 16, 2015","true","1.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

What's your favorite shape? Is it a cube? Oh, please tell me it is. Does your favorite shape have 12 edges? 6 faces? 8 vertices? Oooooooh, it better. Because I got a nice surprise to show ya, buddy.\n\n\nThe cubes in this game. Look at them. Just look at them. Aren't they beautiful? These cubes are glorious. God cubes, cubes beyond the wildest dreams of cube enthusiasts everywhere. These cubes are the kind of cubes our forefathers strove to perfect. The kind they fought wars over. The kind that would make a man shoot his own father and slap his mom's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around for. These cubes are beyond the kind of cubes you might be accustomed to. These are the pinnacle of human creation.\n\n\nYou better like these ♥♥♥♥ing cubes, because that's all you're ♥♥♥♥ing getting.\n\n\nI swear to ♥♥♥♥ing God that's all there is. That's all that's left. Just cubes. Cubes as far as the eyes can see, little buddy. Just lots of God damn mother ♥♥♥♥ing little piece of ♥♥♥♥ cubes. Wouldn't you like some? Well here, have some ♥♥♥♥ing more.\n\n\nRush is a game all about cubes that you can enjoy on your PC or Wii U. Isn't that ♥♥♥♥ing great? All the cubes you could ever want. 1080p, high definition, 60 frames per mother ♥♥♥♥ing second cubes. Anti-aliasing cubes. Cubes that can make your hair grow back, help your wife rediscover what she ever found attractive in you, and fill your body with youthful vigor. They'll listen to your problems, and make everything all better. They'll even let you get it in. That's right, big boy. Those glorious edges, sides, and angles are all yours for the taking.\n\n\nAll you need to do is tell these cubes where to go and what to do. They'll be all over it. Tell them to go left, they go left. Tell them to go right, they go right. Get your cubes to the end of the level and you win. These cubes take orders. Requests, even. Just like the middle-aged Asian lady at the tanning place. Slip her a few bucks and she'll let you into the special tanning bed out back, which is actually a couple folding chairs and a towel with some nice fluorescent lighting. But that's where the magic happens.\n\n\nMuch like said Asian woman, these cubes don't understand English. So your only way to issue orders is through placing little tiles. And you only get so many per level. It has kind of a Chuchu Rocket or Lemmings feel. You're really not doing much. You lay the orders out for the cubes, and watch them get to work moving their sweet, sweet vertices.\n\n\nIt's a simple puzzle game, through and through. Simple idea. Simple design. Minimalist to the end. Sure, later levels can be brutal as all puzzle games can be. But the core mechanics never change. It's always just a matter of judging three-dimensional spacing, timing, and movement. Like how a really long math problem is just a math problem that takes too long to finish so you just use a calculator because you don't want to waste your precious ♥♥♥♥ing time like this game does.\n\n\nJust look at how many little godforsaken cubes there are. You're moving cubes around atop cubes, using cubes to guide them to the end cubes, while cubes watch from the sidelines like some kind of barbaric cube sport amidst a sprawling cube universe. It's the geometric equivalent of white people going to their cottage up north to have board game night and watch reruns of Friends. Sickening.\n\n\nIt's actually a pretty fun game. The puzzles are sweet and satisfying, and the art style is actually really nice. Clean, refreshing, and relaxing. And they really are the prettiest cubes you've ever seen. It's visually appealing to watch them roll around.\n\n\nBut there's just so many ♥♥♥♥ing cubes. Too many of them. And it makes me sick. It's nauseating. Watching them squash and stretch as they roll around, like little cubes of jelly. It's ♥♥♥♥ing irritating, dude. All these happy little cubes pisses me off. Makes me ♥♥♥♥ing mad, dude.\n\n\nYou know why they called this game Rush? Because they RUSHED to get this game out and forgot to use some actual objects instead of just cubes. Ha. Ha ha.","January 6","true","0.2"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","53","9","17","18","0"

I just play the occasional puzzle/platform game that's on sale, and seeing as they're usually under a dollar when on sale, I'm open to new things. I got RUSH for fifty cents, but I feel like it was forty cents too much. After completing the tutorial, the game seems exciting at first, but it quickly gets dull and bland. The physics are very specifically engingeered so that there's almost no freedom. You must always follow their given path, with the exception of maybe three or four different levels, or else you lose for sure. Another thing to note was that before I bought the game, I noticed other people saying how there was a very bright light making it extremely hard to see. I took these people for foolish, seeing as I thought that - like most games - you could just turn down the brightness settings. Unfortunately, you cannot, and this rumor is true. I would strongly advise you don't buy this game, and if you want my opinion, buy Defy Gravity instead.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/recommended/38720/","gdnighthawk","Nighthawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/","206 products in account","Presentation\nOriginally a WiiWare download title called Rubik's Puzzle Galaxy: Rush, the game has since lost its Rubik's licence, being released on Steam simply as Rush, with additional stages and content. Rush is a puzzle game, in which you are given a certain number of directional signs, stop signs or split signs which you can place on the map in order to guide each cube from point A to point B without them colliding or falling off the map. Those stages are grouped based on their difficulty starting with the easy ones, and moving on to the medium ones and the hard ones, allowing you to choose a challenge fit for your experience and get better with time, allowing you to learn from your mistakes, observe how the cubes move once you've hit the green button and rearrange the signs based on what you have seen. There is no sense of advancement since there is no leveling up system and you're not really unlocking anything besides the next levels, but playing Rush more will definitely make you better at it, as long as you keep replaying the same stage, since you're not exactly learning how to play the game better, but instead observing the problems in your sign arrangement; it's more like ruling out the bad solution and eventually getting to the right one, how long it takes to get there depends only on how well you understand the mechanics.\nRating: 7\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is simplistic and intuitive, offering a challenge for everyone and satisfaction to those who dare to give the hardest levels a shot. Placing signs is easy and understanding how they work is the key to solving puzzles, while directional signs are the most encountered ones, using them efficiently is what will get you through as the natural direction of the cube plays an important role in many puzzles, and combining good use of direction movement with things such as speed which can be influenced using a stop sign or a directional sign, and the split sign which will allow you to group cubes based on their color in order to send them in the right direction, all matters in the end. There is also a hint system that will tell you where signs should be placed without giving the exact order, a tool that will come in handy for those who want to enjoy the game without wasting too much time on a single puzzle. There are levels grouped depending on the challenge level, but there's nothing stopping you from enjoying all of them, as the hard ones can be approached using the hint system and the easy ones can be fun even for the pros. Adding all that up, there are more than 80 different stages, with different levels of difficulty, so there's plenty of challenge for everyone.\nRating: 7.5\n\nGraphics\nRush is a colorful universe, using cubes and their respective colors to create beautiful backgrounds that will often captivate you more than the stage itself. Even though all the stages respect the same rules of color and formation, each one feels unique in its own way, and successfully solving a puzzle often rewards you with a beautiful parade of flawlessly moving blocks.\nRating: 7\n\nAudio\nThe electronic soundtrack is in theme with the game, and even though the number of tracks is limited and will become repetitive eventually, you can always play Rush with your own music in the background since there is no dialogue or information given that you'll miss if you do that. The sound effects are okay, yet nothing spectacular to support the colorful movement of successfully guided blocks.\nRating: 6.5\n\nExtras\nWith all its 80+ stages including the bonus stages and the special Portal Event stages, Rush can take anywhere from 3 hours to 10 hours to complete, depending how long it takes for you to give up and hit the hint button, but even so for a 5 bucks title, you get plenty of content to play around with.\nRating: 7.5\n\nVerdict\nRush is a must play for puzzle fans who want a little challenge, but it still provides a few intriguing levels for the casual puzzle solvers too, so there are enough reasons for everyone to give it a shot and see how well they can guide the cubes.\nRating Overall: 7.1\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about RUSH at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=355","July 1, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You put directions on a map, click go, and cubes roll around following your directions to reach a goal. I played a game like this on CD-ROM in 1996 and there's been about a thousand in between. RUSH's gimmick is that there's multiple cubes rolling around at once, supposedly upping the problem-solving. But, lethally, the timing of when cubes will knock against walls and collide is so delicate that it's almost impossible to see without experimentation. So the whole thing ends up a sickeningly frustrating trial-and-error spam that washes out all skill and inspiration. ♥♥♥♥ this game.\n\nAlthough the music's nice","July 27, 2014","false","1.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The difficulty of the easy and medium puzzles is incredibly low such that even a modest ability will breeze right through them - probably suitable for babby's first puzzle game. The hard puzzles tend to be more annoying than puzzling. Lots of trial and error to handle the timing to avoid collisions, instead of actually thoughtfully puzzling out non-intuitive solutions.\n\nThe interface could be much better too, but I suppose at this price-point I can't hate on it too much.\n\nThat said, if you can get it on a really cheap sale, which is likely, it isn't *completely* devoid of fun if you think this might be your type of game.","March 15","false","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In rush you used direction tiles as well as other types to guide cubes to exits. One of the top reason to buy Rush is the fact that there is no competition in this game. There is no clock to time you, there are no scores to obtain, it’s just your mind against puzzles. All these factors combined with a very soothing tune and you’re in for a very zen-like period while playing. This game hits perfection almost everywhere, the pacing is fantastic, the controls are intuitive, and the art direction is very relevant to the game. However, the game completely lacks replayability and all the puzzles have very limited solutions. This is because each puzzles have a fixed amount of tiles and in almost every scenario in Rush, you will end up using them all. Regardless, the game is very high quality and for such a cheap price replayability is a non-issue.","September 12, 2012","true","3.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

It is a world comprised entirely of blocks. The idea of the game is to redirect the various colored blocks into their respectively colored "exit".\n\nThe main rule is if the blocks hit a wall, they will turn to the right. You must use this and many other tools to move them, turn them, stop them, speed up, slow down, or use the "wall turn right" mechanic to get them to the correct goal.\n\nAs crazy hard as the puzzles get, they still pale in comparison to the soundtrack. It's beautiful, upbeat, and relaxing all at once. Just like I said in the title, I want this soundtrack so, so bad.\n\nIn celebration to the release of Portal 2, RUSH received a few, free DLC's that featured Glados, and DAMN THEY ARE HARD!\n\nIt's casual in that it's not high stress and there's no punishment for losing. You just keep going until you figure it out. You can also ask the game for a hint, or the answer itself.\n\nIt's cheap, it's simple, it's relaxing. Normally I'd say this is a mobile game that needs to stay off of Steam, but if they can bring this kind of quality, then they can stay. 10/10 Because it did so well what it sought to achieve.","September 23, 2014","true","11.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

So in other words, it's a laid back puzzle game. Admittedly, I'm very bad at puzzle games, either out of impatience or stupidity. I made it all the way through the medium puzzles before having to walkthrough the rest of the game. That said, the puzzles are complex and rewarding, as you get to watch a colorful show of cubes after cracking a puzzle. The game really encourages a "trial and error" approach to puzzle solving, allowing you to tweak your solution until it finally works. It doesn't punish you for a wrong solution.\n\nWhile this type of puzzle design is nice, it's not very well-accomodated. If you want to test your solution, you have to run it from the very beginning, rather than being able to jump to a certain moment like a simulation. This also means messing around with the awkward camera controls. The overall visual design is bright, and some levels can take up the entire screen, making viewing a level with ease damn near impossible. Not that it hinders your ability to solve puzzles unless the game throws really complex structures at you, but it makes debugging your solution and observing the level a little more uncomfortable than it should be.\n\nRUSH's simplistic visuals may be a turn-off for some, but hey, it's a puzzle game. You add onto it some stellar music and a wide variety of puzzles and gizmos, and you've got a game worthy of any puzzle addict's collection.

So in other words, it's a laid back puzzle game. Admittedly, I'm very bad at puzzle games, either out of impatience or stupidity. I made it all the way through the medium puzzles before having to walkthrough the rest of the game. That said, the puzzles are complex and rewarding, as you get to watch a colorful show of cubes after cracking a puzzle. The game really encourages a "trial and error" approach to puzzle solving, allowing you to tweak your solution until it finally works. It doesn't punish you for a wrong solution.\n\nWhile this type of puzzle design is nice, it's not very well-accomodated. If you want to test your solution, you have to run it from the very beginning, rather than being able to jump to a certain moment like a simulation. This also means messing around with the awkward camera controls. The overall visual design is bright, and some levels can take up the entire screen, making viewing a level with ease damn near impossible. Not that it hinders your ability to solve puzzles unless the game throws really complex structures at you, but it makes debugging your solution and observing the level a little more uncomfortable than it should be.\n\nRUSH's simplistic visuals may be a turn-off for some, but hey, it's a puzzle game. You add onto it some stellar music and a wide variety of puzzles and gizmos, and you've got a game worthy of any puzzle addict's collection. Unless you're feeble-minded, like me.","October 6, 2014","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It starts out simply enough- here's some cubes, get them to the exit, here's some arrows to make them go in directions. By the time you realize it, you're threading slower-moving cubes between waves of advancing ones with precision timing, tossing cubes down holes with no visible exit, teleporting around with wild abandon, and even solving a puzzle in complete darkness (check the bonus levels, it's really there). If you like puzzle games, give this a shot, if only for the catchy soundtrack.\n\nHeck, if you're going to get it, go for the whole Two Tribes pack and enjoy Toki Tori and EDGE with it.\n\nPROS:\nGreat soundtrack\nDifficulty scales up nicely over time\nHints for those puzzles you just can't figure out\nCheap\n\nCONS:\nNo hints for the Actual Challenge levels (but then again, this was part of the Potato Sack ARG, so that would make it too easy.)\nLimited replay value (unless you really want to shoot for cheevos)","December 27, 2011","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a similar emphasis as the former on what's essentially visual programming, and also features the latter's basic gameplay mechanic of cubes rolling around on a 3-dimensional playing field. The result is an enjoyable puzzle game that can keep you occupied for hours. While the puzzles are much less open-ended than the ones in SpaceChem and thus provide less replay value, the solutions can, at times, provide considerable satisfaction from just looking at them, with large numbers of colourful cubes rolling around in sync with each other.

However, RUSH is a lot better then I thought. It's a block based puzzle game where you have a get these cubes through maps with limited movement blocks (It's hard to explain but thats the basic concept of it). You can get addicted to it because how well its made because the maps are all in clever patterns that use up all the resources and leaves you pretty happy with how your result was when you finish the level. Overall RUSH is great for it's money and is a really fun time-waster (The minutes flew by) So, if you like puzzle games and clever level design, RUSH is right up your street! However it does lack a lot in the music department (I don't even think it's got music) But still, a great game\n\n8/10 (Pretty darn good..Eugh, have to say darn so it's not censored)\n+ Creative Puzzles\n+ Great level design\n+ Good payoff\n- Lack of music","July 30, 2014","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eeltrain/recommended/38720/","eeltrain","Knife-Armed Robot Hedgehog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eeltrain/","144 products in account","RUSH is a solid puzzle game, unique in the way that each one needs to be. The basic mechanic of using directional and other controlling pads to direct blocks of various colors toward their respective goals is an intelligent and compelling one, if slightly more so on paper than when playing. I give my compliments to the developers for wringing as much life as they have with RUSH out of a few simple pad types: up, down, left, right (no cheating - the pads rotate in tandem as you rotate the camera), alternate-direction (this one's my favorite, particularly with the puzzles that having blocks approach the pad from different directions creates), conveyor (shifts a block over one space while preserving its direction), and temporary-stop. Use of warp points, while a bit of a design crutch, adds more variety so I'll give it a pass. The game does get tedious, though, when you have to fine-tune your pathways so that blocks don't run into one another. In moderation this would add welcome depth to the gameplay, but as it is, it shifts the balance a little too far from creative problem-solving to drudging trial-and-error. Another, less frequently visible flaw in the game mechanics is that the number of blocks you must allow through your system is inconsistent - I once noticed that, due to the way I had my alternate-direction pads set up, my solution wouldn't have worked if one more block of each color had been expelled. The general feeling of designing cycles, however, is quite relaxing, so the gameplay is still well in the positive zone in my eyes.\n\nThere's not much to be said about the aesthetics. The music, while extremely repetitive, somehow scarcely gets annoying. The visuals... exist. My only complaints tangent to a discussion of aesthetics here concern the camera: you can't zoom, and the overhead expanse of blocks in the "crocodile" (or was it "alligator"?) level is a needless hindrance. Not impossible to work around, but not pleasant.\n\nOverall, RUSH is an enjoyable, if imperfect, piece of work, and I'd recommend picking it up if you want something to occupy a few minutes (or longer) here and there as needed.","April 22, 2014","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music is pretty well suited to the game as well, it has a good beat to it.\n\nThe only complaint would be like others have said and that's the fact that a number of achievements are not possible anymore or restricted to certain months. Other then that however, I'd strongly suggest you pick up this game, especially considering the price ($5.49 CAD at time of writing). That being said, you could probably wait for a sale and grab it for under $2. Either way it's a great deal!","January 13","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
