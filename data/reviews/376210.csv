I did enjoy the game when i started it, its still in early access and bugs are to be expected, mostly we've laughed over them, its alot of pvp at the moment.. but thats where the issues start to arise sadly. Not so much with the game but the devs and forum mods. Which is what brings me to review this so poorly. All of the expeiences are myself and friends.\n\nOn reporting any bugs players get told "its early access and to be expected" to which confuses me.. aren't we supposed to report these so they can get fixed?  The posts from the players posting the bug and giving screens will often get locked and deleted. Other bugs include crashing, freezing, players asking for the lag to be addressed, and hopefully worked on, to which all are replyed to "Get a better computer" and " Connection bugs on ISPs not paying fees"\n\nOn asking any questions to the devs or mods, threads are locked and deleted if they are questions related to where the game is headed, anything on breeding or any discussion on thoughts to different dinos abilities and looks.\n\nThe latest stream with the owner, Dondi, a post was released in the forums by a dev [deathlyrage] stating to "Ask about the new breeding system" So many of us went into the stream to ask.. to which nothing was anwered, no talk of it and everything relating to it was ignored. After which this post was deleted and denied [Thou a few people like myself kept copies]\n\nMy biggest issue however is the forums, players will always talk and wish and express what they want to, its freedom of speech. But when the mods go in and lock threads, shut down posts, tell people "Thats never going to happen" when they are only mod, ban others because they don't like what they post or just have issue with the players themselves in the game. That is immature and frankly turns me away from this game.  anyone even breathing a word of it is publicly ostracized by both the community AND devs.\n\nA parting note, some comments from the people that do the locking and deleting\nhttp://puu.sh/n3396/7da633450b.png\nhttp://puu.sh/n33ak/623b64ef64.png\nand my favorite, a list of people that they have banned for... what?  and why are they sharing this info?\nhttp://puu.sh/n337M/82f200acd2.png\nthis is from the people that are supposed to be unbias and decided what we can and cannot say?\nThis game.. the people creating it and running, just save yourself the headache and anger and fustrations and avoid it.\n\n\nhttp://puu.sh/ng8fz/c42e7ad55a.png\n","May 13","false","15.5"," 529 of 590 people (90%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","90","529","590","29","153"

You pick a dinosaur from a list of six dinosaurs (currently), and it plops you in the world with a ghostly UI of a food and water meter. You drink and eat simply by pressing "E" on the respective source. Now, here's where it starts to differ from other games out there; It literally plays out like a dinosaur version of DayZ and it's awesome. I can't even begin to express the look on my face when I saw another Rex and we just bellowed at each other until we got close enough to see each other's names. After doing so we formed a makeshift pack and roamed around the island, hunting and stalking our prey. Eventually we came across a herd of Gallimimus and quickly dispatched them as they did not see us coming. The fact we were these massive animals, and we efficiently hunted and killed an animal much smaller and faster than us, is simply amazing. Okay, so the gameplay of the Austroraptor is also something short of a miracle. This is the first time in a video game that I have seen actual human players be able to efficiently stalk and kill a Rex by jumping onto it's body and actually latching on. The raptors in this game can jump, press right click and left click, and they will bite and latch onto the target and do a slow damage over time. Impressive.\n\nContent:\nAs of right now, there are currently six animals to play from but a handful of skins for each, even glowing bioilluminescent ones! There is a very simple and shallow eating and drinking system, but the coolest part is by far the herbivores eating plants and the plants disappearing. Love that. Crouching and stalking as a Rex, as read about above, is amazingly fun. Currently if I were to rate this game based on content, it would get a solid 5/10. But since it's EA and I have faith in Dondi, I'm not going to waste anyone's time with a number system for this category.\n\n\nCommunity:\nNot much I can write here as of right now, but it is definitely a milestone when you can see a random dinosaur in the distance and become packmates or herdmates with it just by roaring and biting the air. So far so good, keep up the good work people.\n\nPlayability:\nOptimization needs work, but it's miles ahead of what the demo was. I hope to see it increase over time but something tells me with the roadmap planned that it will remain the same strictly because of how much they are going to ADD to the game. Overall the game plays perfectly fine and the dinosaurs are a blast to control!\n\nProblems:\nOkay, this list is short and sweet CURRENTLY. My only 'problems' are such;\n\n-Take damage from packmates\n-Server browser sometimes doesn't show a loading screen when a server is being logged onto\n-Names above dinosaurs are too big\n-Push to talk is not in yet, so everyone's microphone is live all the time\n-The stomping is too loud, compared to the walking sound\n-Sometimes the server I am on crashes for no reason\n-Being able to glitch into a dinosaur as another dinosaur bothers me, haha\n-Definitely need a way to 'smell' herbivores, otherwise starvation is an actual concern\n-Quetzacoatylus isn't playable yet.\n\nOverall, I say this game is worth the asking price.\n\nI will update this over time as things change!","December 2, 2015","true","96.8"," 198 of 230 people (86%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","86","198","230","17","11"

Thankfully this is still in the Alpha so I have a few things I'd like to suggest.\n\n1. Simulation,\ngo deeper into it such as the need to sleep or Reproduce and have dino babies maybe even "clans"/"families"\n\n2. More dinosaurs,\nsuch as the flying one pterodactyl\n\n3. SPAWN LOCATION\nand this is a really important one because to meet up you have to get your partner's coordinates. How about you just divide the map into different areas and let us pick where we want to spawn instead of randomly spawning somewhere and having to walk for ages.\n\n4. More NPCs\nThe servers are, even with a lot of players on, really empty due to the lack of NPC dinosaurs. Make it more realistic by adding more NPC Dinos\n\n5. Goals\nThe goal of this game is obviously surviving but little goals such as "find water" or "hunt a dinosaur" or "reproduce" would be nice too so you have something you can follow throughout the game\n\nIn the end these are just some suggestions me and a friend of mine have because that's some things we would love to see in this game in the future.

When finished, it will be a hardcore survival including humans (tribals, cannibals, mercenaries) and a complex progression system that I will not go into because no one is 100% sure how it will work.\n\nThe graphics are stunning if you have a PC that can handle the game with full settings. If not, the game is not optimized well, so you will probably be stuck with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics or getting a refund. The animations and models are the most realistic of any dinosaur game, excluding stegosaurus and anklyosaurus' animations for attacking...\n\nThe developers are the most hardworking and persistent in a game, especially an indie game with a small team, that I have ever seen. They can be snappy at moments, but for good reason if you read below.\n\nThe community is complete and utter cancer, with a few exceptions. I have never seen a more ungrateful, needy group of people. The devs work their asses off to release updates almost daily and most comments on the patch notes are kids saying, "WHERE IS THE QUETZAL" "GIVE US THE QUETZAL YOU GUYS LIED TO US." Not to mention the lack of people in the community who read the pinned threads of the discussion page and end up suggesting dinosaurs/mechanics that are already confirmed for the game or asking for ETA's. I've even seen threads of people asking the devs to make a dinosaur before a certain date. It would be one thing if there was just a couple threads doing this, but the discussions page is literally bombarded with people asking for ETA's/Dinosaurs/Bug fixes that are already known.\n\nOverall, The Isle is a very enjoyable game that has a lot of potential with diligent devs who don't half-♥♥♥ anything. I'm extremely excited to see where this game goes.\n\n","April 9","true","560.9"," 127 of 142 people (89%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","89","127","142","19","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Predatoria/recommended/376210/","Predatoria","Predatoria","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Predatoria/","12 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe Isle has a certain quality and sheen to it that other games, especially indie games, do not usually have.  It may be the Unreal 4 engine, the well-done models and animations, the sound effects, skins, etc, but the game doesn't feel cheap or crappy.  Everything is solid, substantial, and meaningful.  While currently not a finished product, the game feels like taking the wheel behind an expensive car as it passes through an assembly line.  Everything just feels good, nice, of high quality, and I have no reason to doubt this trend will continue as updates push out frequently.\n\nThe Isle as it stands right now is an open sandbox dinosaur environment with survival mechanics on the side.  You simply select the dinosaur you wish to play from a menu and spawn in an open map.  Your goals are what you make them to be.  You must immediately search for food and water, but death has no true cost yet.  Your activities are entirely player created.  I spend most of my time hunting and killing other players, and find the games current combat mechanics to be simple, yet enjoyable and fun to try and master.\n\nThe game will transform as time goes on, becoming more focused on a survival experience rather than just a sandbox with no real game-based goals.  The ideas the devs have shared regarding the direction they wish to bring the game, however, looks fantastic.  There are all kinds of amazing concepts and stuff they are planning to add that I can't wait to see.  Also, though I love the open sandbox, I also love the thrill of trying to survive.  Some of my best times in this game have been when I'm on the brink of death searching desperately for a corpse to feed off.  I expect as the game continues development, more of these moments will be had, and more frequently.\n\nI personally have no issues with any of the devs of this game, though I see much discussion on this topic from others.  If you’re really that concerned about offensive devs, don’t join discord and steer clear of the forums where they post frequently.  It’s that simple.\n\nThe same goes for the community.  I’ve made a lot of friends on this game, and most the people I talk to are friendly and cool people, both in-game and on the forums.\n\nI think this game’s going to make it to something great, and I encourage you to hop on for the ride there.\n","March 11","true","129.4"," 108 of 118 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","108","118","5","6"

Without saying anything.\nIt was great :D -Until I died :)\n\nAfter exploring more Dinosaur options I settled onto a Galli.\nSoon after spawning I ran into a Puertasaurus.\nAfter trying out a Puertasaurus I knew that being one is lonely, due to it's slow speed.\nIt was also under  attack from a raptor. I ran in attacked the raptor and we scared it off.\nThe 2 of us then proceeded to wander the map for over an hour.\nAfter 40 minutes of us gesturing with our calls to indicate predators, mountain passes etc.. he typed for the first time in global chat. Just to say he appreciated my company.\n\nAt the moment this is a quiet game with brief moments of terror.\nBut the social aspect is different from any I've played before.\nThere is a global chat in-game. But despite a few people always talking, it's amazing how many simply communicate using body language.\n\nWith the addition of factions, humans etc later this may change.

Or you can play AS a dinosaur.\n\n10/10\nWould wander amlessly with a silent friend again","January 1","true","280.6"," 90 of 98 people (92%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","92","90","98","27","1"

They still left a copy of the stable build for you to play though, but didnt leave a guide on how to do so and they didnt host a 'Legacy' server so people could play on the stable build. So I did. *edit* actually they didnt explain what was going on in depth very well at all...\nThis resulted in me getting banned. Even with the expressed permission of one of the devs to make information about my/the only legacy server available...\nThe mods and the devs need to communicate more, them punishing me and not helping me get the information out about the legacy build lead a lot of people to believe I was spamming and advertising (which got me banned on actual game servers) when really I was posting a fix. The fix: The server I paid $90 to host because they and no one else had and a guide on how to change your build and what the build really was. Read the thread yourself.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/376210/discussions/7/364040166677550022/\n\n*edit* My spamming was actually: Me selectively reading and posting on threads that were asking for help with the new patch, complaining about the new patch, or just not digging being on the test build whatsoever. I was not posting the guide onto every new thread that popped up. Only threads that were relevant to the fix that being on the Legacy brought. This could have been avoided if the mods/devs would have pinned a guide like they said they would and hosted a server so people could actually play on the Legacy build. Instead they left it up to the player base to do so and then punished said players for showing others that it even existed. It has yet to be pinned in the general discussion with an in depth description as to what the heck is going on...\n\nAs for the game: The game is really fun in the Legacy (stable) build. Very addicting.\nBut I wouldnt even try playing on the Public build anymore... It is riddled with bugs and crashes.\n\nPros: fun game, though I found myself turning off the chat and playing solo more than grouping up with people...\nFoilage! All the vegetation makes the maps look alive. Some places are so dense with trees and bushes you can literally become invisible while crouching in them with some of the dinos. This makes for some really fun tactical gameplay, esp if your positioned on a spawn migration route towards water.\nA major sense of realism- takes a while to get used to. These arent HollyWood Dinos :P\nModels! All the Dinosaur models look stunning and are incredibly fun to experience!\nStability! While playing on the Legacy build of the game, it runs suprisingly smooth and doesnt crash often if ever.\n\nCons: Buggy and has a lot of crashes while playing on Public build.\nHorrible community - reason for turning off chat while playing and the devs/mods have no customer support skills whatsoever/get on major power trips. This overall decided my rating with the game. I've never supported something when I didn't like who was producing it. I felt truly insulted by PunchPacket and the community as a whole when trying to make information available.\n\n\nEdit* Read the comments of this review for more on the terrible customer support.\nStarts on Page 5 of the comments. Yes, five pages of being talked down to and argued with...\nAs someone who paid for this game and was chased away by the Devs/Mods, I simply cannot suggest that anyone buy this game.

It just makes it less fun, trust me xD\n\nPros:\n- really good Graphics\n- cool animations\n- no need to buy skins (they removed them for now though)\n- species chat, which allows carnivores to plan attacks on herbivores\n- realistic maps\n- realistic dino voices\n- raptor pounce/latch\n- hunting and survival\n\nCons:\n- Low amount of dinosaurs (atm, there's going to be even more!)\n- If you hunt with someone, there's a big chance that you will be biting eachother while attacking something\n- No sense of smell (atm)\n- No way of telling what is where if you don't know the coording system or have poor memory, for you can remember where to go by remembering the terrain.\n\nguess that's all.\n\nSo, I totally recommend buying the game if you like dinosaurs, hunting and survival. If the price is really so big of an issue to you, then I recommend waiting for some promotion.\n\n","January 30","true","173.9"," 78 of 101 people (77%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","77","78","101","9","2"

It has a lot of potential. Sadly, there is a reason ARK: Survival Evolved just added 200 new XBone servers, and The Isle barely manages to keep one, perhaps 2 servers at peak hours (capped at 75 and 50 players respectively) full.\n\nMy review of the game and it's content will be down below, though I can sum it up by saying, the game as it stands is not worth the price unless you're an extreme dinosaur enthusiast who isn't satisfied with ARK, The Hunter Primal, or pretty much... any other Dinosaur game. As I hear it, ARK has a mod that allows you to play as dinosaurs now. And it has a better world map, and lots more gameplay and dinosaur species to offer as well. So unless you're absolutely desperate, I say look elsewhere.\n\nFirst, I'd like to start off by reviewing what is single handedly the biggest problem of the game.\n\nThe Dev Team and the Community.\n\nI wish someone had told me about all of this before I purchased the game... Hopefully someone will find this review helpful, and morally object to supporting these kinds of people. If I can deter at least one potential buyer, I've done my job. ((*note* A couple choice pieces of info will be info I gleaned from other negative reviews and not something I experienced personally.))\n\nThe devs are extremely rude and openly admit to being trolls, with great pride no less! They openly mock, ridicule, and attack their community... you know, the people who spent their hard earned money on a very rough early access game. To support their idea. And I don't just mean attack in game. I mean both on their forums and during their live streams.\n\nThey openly make fun of players who have physical and mental disabilities (especially autism) and casually use words like the F word for gay people, and it seems like they even use the N word for black people. I myself saw Dondi say something to the effect of "Nignag" in Tyrranosaur species chat during a live stream. There was no one on the server at the time with such a steam name. So I think I can safely put 2 + 2 together here and figure out what kind of person he is, and what he was saying at the time...\n\nAlso, during a live stream someone had the nerve to ask if there would be a censor for their human models, like in the game Rust, because they will be naked. Dondi proceeded to show off their models, particularly the genitals, in an attempt to intentionally ♥♥♥♥ people off.\n\nYou can see we aren't dealing with very mature or professional people here.\n\nAlso, don't let their early access game info fool you. Particularly the section about including the community.\n\nI once had the gall to suggest that instead of several small updates daily that push the game from working, to broken, to working, to broken again, perhaps they could wait and do one big update daily. Or maybe even do just a few big updates per week. You know, like experienced developers do?\n\nThe lead developer Dondi, proceeded to personally attack me, saying that I was just being a whiner and a cry baby, and that I just don't have the skill level required to play their game. He also said that they ONLY take suggestions from Top Tier players. And those who aren't top tier should just be quiet and quit bothering the poor devs.\n\nHow can the game grow if the devs can't take even the most basic of constructive criticsm? And what was the patch that broke the game that I was supposedly martyring, you may ask? It's quite simple. They made changes to the stamina system. Previously, most dinosaurs could run long distances and cover a lot of ground. Then, they randomly changed the stamina values of all species, effectively crippling the speed at which they could travel and making travel tedious at worst and deadly at best. In the next couple of patches, they eventually added both a resting mechanic that helped slightly remedy the issues caused by the first patch, and then a trotting function in a much later patch, which has also helped to ease the blow the changes to stamina caused. But I don't think it was unreasonable to suggest that they add all 3 features in a single patch, rather than add them one at a time and break the game for a few hours. It should just make sense that all 3 mechanics that play off of each other would be added in a single patch. Otherwise, you've basically added bullets to the game without guns...\n\nSadly, the drama train doesn't end there. Levia Draconia, the skin designer and artist for the game was let go from the project without being paid for work she had already completed. She did quite a lot of stirring the pot. The rest of the Dev team never gave an official response, so we can't really know anything besides what Levia told us, but in response to her complaints about not being paid, Dondi and the other devs completely blocked communications with her, they removed all the skins she had created from the game, refused to allow her to post them on the steam workshop, if and when they added workshop support, and Dondi is on record referring to her as "a leech" and "cancerous". Eventually this issue was settled and it seems like Levia is back on the main development team. But the fact that something like this even happened at all is telling.\n\nThe devs also encourage public shaming. After creating a test server, they merely labeled it as (KEEP OUT) instead of... you know... putting a password lock on it? Or something that any experienced "Veteran" Deveopler would know to do. Of course people joined the server despite the "big" Keep out sign in the server name. And the devs responded by creating a "Wall of Shame"\n\nhttp://puu.sh/n337M/82f200acd2.png\n\nTo top the cake, when people reported the thread for the harrassment that it obviously is, the moderator both defended and encouraged the practice.\n\nhttp://puu.sh/n3396/7da633450b.png\nhttp://puu.sh/n33ak/623b64ef64.png\n\nAnd lastly (for this section) if it's any indication, the default skins for the game are skins from The Stomping Land (another infamous failed dinosaur game for those who don't know). I'm not really sure how they got their hands on them or what rights they have to them but during their big debacle with their texture artist, the skins from The Stomping Land were the only skins in the game.\n\nDuring live streams the Devs regularly attack and harrass each other as well. In-fighting amongst the devs could easily lead to them walking away from this project. I really can't encourage anyone to support the game knowing how juvenile and unprofessional the dev tem is.\n\nOh, and they also have a habit of handing out lifetime bans for anyone they don't like or who disagrees with them. I'm more than certain that posting this review will get me a ban. And if it doesn't well, lucky me?\n\nAs for the community, there are a handful who are good people. I've made some good friends and some familiar allies, even though for the most part all we had to communicate were a series of calls and gestures. Unfortunately, there is a disturbingly large chunk of the community who hang on the dev's every word, no matter how bigoted, hateful or heinous. They're incapable of offering any helpful feedback because they accept all of the dev's decisions as if they are from god, and actively attack those who do offer helpful, constructive criticsm in any regard. It is excessively difficult to offer any kind of feed back when the devs ignore it, insult you for it, and the bulk of the "community" are all on their knees playing the blind little fanboy and generally being Dondi's little sycophant crew. As if getting his recognition (which is usually passive aggressive at best, and actively insulting at worst) somehow betters their lives.\n\n\nAs for the game itself...\n\nFor the most part it's solid. Though it doesn't run well on low graphical settings or low end computers. Check out the other negative reviews for more info on that. And please, do your research before buying.","February 19","false","61.0"," 136 of 194 people (70%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","70","136","194","16","35"

I did not expect to have this much fun with such a simple game. The current game play is your typical survival game, except you're a dinosaur and you just run, eat, and fight. If that sounds boring to you, then you do not appreciate the thrill of hunting in a pack of raptors, or the terror of being stalked through the woods by carnivores.\n\nThe incoming features and dinosaurs will make this game absolutely delicious, and I foresee myself logging several hundred more hours of time on this game.

If I could get a refund, I certainly would without hesitation. Instead, I have to settle for warning other users that this Dev may not ever deliver the game if they can't even pay their artist.\n\nEDIT: News of a turnaround happening reached me after work this morning (Feb 9th). I would advise anyone to keep an eye on the matter, forums and on Steam, and see if things change for the better or whatever other news might turn up.\n\nEDIT THE SECOND: Not concerning Devs, but I can't possibly support the sort of behavior that is outright PROMOTED within the discussions either. And this time I do have proof to supply that should remain for a long time:\n\nhttp://puu.sh/n337M/82f200acd2.png <-- this opening post is in direct violation of Steam's Discussion Rules and Guidelines. Several users are called idiots in the OP, and comments within encourage harassing these users in-game. This topic has been reported numerous times, but has only been locked (it should be removed entirely).\n\nAs if that wasn't disgusting enough, we have two screenshots of a MODERATOR, a person who is there to uphold the community and discussion rules and guidelines, saying the following:\nhttp://puu.sh/n3396/7da633450b.png\nhttp://puu.sh/n33ak/623b64ef64.png\n\nLook at those posts and you tell me if you genuinely believe this is a community you want to play with, much less support? The moderator promoted the harassment, name-calling, and the bullying of these users. That is not what a moderator should be doing in any capacity, and further this moderator actually promotes public shaming. This is genuinely disgusting to me.\n\nI'll keep updating my review as more ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan.\n\nEDIT THE THIRD: The artist is working with the Devs again, so my first misgivings can be ignored for the time being. Of course, this opens a whole new can of worms, but with nothing to go on, it isn't worth really discussing that at this time.\n\nThe moderator nonsense, however, is still a fun topic.","January 27","false","2.3"," 498 of 781 people (64%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","64","498","781","28","190"

Take that as you will. It should raise some warning flags about the people playing and supporting this game.\n\nI'm putting it back up because the dev team is still unprofessional, insults their clients and players, and such an irresponsible team is unlikely to get their game finished and released. They referred to their texture artist as "a leech" and "cancerous" and refused to pay her, then "settled" it later, supposedly. Don't support them, don't encourage this immature behavior. Be smart about where your money goes, and don't throw it away on yet another hastily-made early access dinosaur "game".\n\nAnd for those that insist my review isn't "a real review" because I don't talk about the "game", here you go: There is no game to review. It's a couple nice-looking dinosaur models with varying textures slapped onto a premade map where you walk around, eat, drink, and sit. That's it. Again: There is no "game" to review. There are no goals, there is no incentive to play, and the developers break their game with every update. Herbivores are unable to eat with one of the recent updates, and what is the team's focus? Adding another dinosaur. More skins.\n\nIt's literally a dinosaur walking simulator, nothing more. It has even less than ARK did at launch, and that's pretty sad.

I spawn in, take a look around at where I am, and realize a Carno spawns in on top of me. I croon at him thinking I can get away with not being eaten, but soon enough he's chasing me.\n\nI bolt for the nearest lake while screaming for help in my adorable little dryo squeaking voice. Bobbing and weaving among the trees hoping to throw off the carno, until ultimately I get chomped when I run out of trees.\n\n10/10 would Dryo Squeak for my life again. :D\n\n_______________________________\n\nAs for the real review, this game being in its initial stages is already freaking awesome. I've had the privelage to watch the streams the dev puts up, along with interacting and reporting my own share of bugs and such to contribute to helping this game improve in all areas. I'm always excited for what patch is coming next as there's always something new being rolled out.\n\nEspecially with the frequency by which this game is updated, seemingly every week to almost every day! there's always something to look forward too, and it shows there's a huge amount of dedication being put into this game. There are some salty people reviewing this game as bad just to be jerks because they don't like the creator, but the way I look at it, you came to play this game to play the game, not have philisophical discussions with the dev. If you don't like him, don't talk to him. o_O\n\nI've played this game for what is it, 120.5hrs already? (yeesh), and I've come to understand Dondi's brand of humor and sure it might not be for everyone, but I can appreciate the morbidity of it and the fact that he doesn't get swayed by hateful rhetoric from salty people who've only put in 20 minutes into the game or what have you.\n\nI personally have enjoyed the hell out of watching Dondi's stream as well as Bryan and Bikeman's, etc. I've laughed until I've cried from how funny watching the Stegosaurus being rigged was that one evening. I'm sure everyone that was present that night had sore sides from how hard we all were laughing, and it's moments like that that really show to me this game is a labor of love and not just in it for the money.\n\nBeing able to see the game THIS early is a privelage I feel, since some games don't even roll out this early on, but because of this I get to see some insight on how the game is created, I get to ask the devs how things work, how they made a map or a dino, or a skin, etc. You can't say that about every game out there!\n\nI highly encourage you to get this game now, especially for the price it's at, and there's already a growing community and the fact that it's being updated SO frequently makes it almost like opening a Christmas gift every time.\n\nDon't pay attention to the ones complaining about this or that, play the game for yourself and let your own experiences decide for you how you choose to play.  I personally like to scavenge as a Rex, since I'm a lazy ♥♥♥♥, but I do hunt and will defend my pack, etc when it's needed. It's a lot of fun and I've sunk in a lot of hours already with more to come.\n\nThis is a great survival game set in the time of dinosaurs with a lot of respect paid to the dino models and the environment. Eventually there will be humans and cannibals, and more dinos, so definitely get this game!

We've seen the adding and updating of a more player friendly map called Reigon 1. We've seen the Therzino being added (and quickly nerfed) to the game. The Puerta had its eating and attack system overhauled even before Therzino came out.\n\nNow we're entering 2016- boy what a time to be alive for this game. In these first two months alone we're looking to see 2 systems for players being added. Progression, groups, and spawning/logging out. These will be vital to the base of the game, we have a volunteer modeler who is developing our best models for the progression/spawning system. Great guy.\n\nTo the game though. The game itself, it is bare bones. Yes, all you can currently do is run and eat. But species chat is in, so you only talk to players using the same dinosaur as you. Making stalking, migrating, and hunting all the more tense. The game can set you on edge, if you're a herd of Shantungosaurus' and a Rex pack of 8 shows up behind and in front of you. You'll want to run, but your trapped. Moments like this are wonderful.\n\nThe game won't hand you a thing to do, no "build a home and a tame a dinosaur" or "go rescue bully because he didn't run now he's Rex kibble". You're goal is to survive and the tasks that come  with it to ensure yourself a higher chance of survival.\n\nAlso, lets get a few things straight.\n\n1) Shanty is twice the weight and size of Rex- it should by all means be able to 1hko you. Granted it comes at a huge cost for the shanty.\n\n2) The game is EA it is being developed- at a terrifying rate too. If you wish to support the devs buy the game.

It's a game that has pretty horrendous gameplay but every goes nuts for the random skin drops. The Isle isn't like that, sure it might look bland a for a little while but this community has amazing artists that would love to help out with development. Not to mention the dev team won't abandon the game entirely over someone leaving.\n\nGoing on to gameplay, like stated earlier, it's great. It is definately one of the better dinosaur games, although in early development, the massive maps and sheer amount of players make everything feel authentic. You could join a pack of Raptors or start a herd, or even be a loner and survive however you want. With a nice group of dinosaurs to select at the moment, the ecosystem is good. (Game is regularly balanced and new dinosaurs are confirmed to be added over time.) It's worth it's price, if you want to just relax and try not to die this is the game for you.\n\n","January 27","true","29.5"," 75 of 111 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","75","111","4","24"

I cannot recommend this game because I feel from the beginning of the game to right now, I kind of feel that it’s starting to become a shadow of its former self. From the development to the community, I feel its falling apart and despite on "we're going to make it THE dinosaur game", it's just another dinosaur game that is slowly repeating the same mistakes as the 1st primal carnage and Stomping Lands (which I never played stomping lands but most players who played said, "You're a very fortunate person.")\nThe game is simple: pick any dino and do what you feel like doing: roleplay, hunt, kill, or just chill. Simple right? Well here is the catch. You have to move around cautiously in case you spawn around a mountain area because if you fall over 1 inch, you break your leg. Yes, over an inch. And its torture at times to when you see another dino, you're going to beg him to kill you. Oh, but you want because if that dino is another species, he can't see what you're typing because the chat is species only. Now a majority said, it’s to add realism and more survival to the game. Honestly, it was to stop carebearing. And prepare for tons of flame wars on who is right and who is wrong, carebears vs kos, "WHO KILLED ME WHILE I WAS AFK?!", "YOU KILLED MY BEST FRIEND!", and my personal favorite, "WHO KILLED THAT CUTE, INNOCENT DRYO?!" I kill dryo sometimes because it’s fun and I'm a carnivore. You would not believe the reaction you get for killing one. The whole server chases you and become the most wanted player on the isle. All for kiling 1 dryo. So much for the dinosaur game. The models are great and the skins are great. I love the bloodthrister rex skin, my favorite skin by far. Better than all those primal carnage: extinction skins, and it’s not even $300 bucks(You PC:E guys know what I'm talking about!) Not this new rex model. It feels so lifeless and kinda boring. Then again that's what you get for firing a skin developer that you claim was trash...\n\nOh and the game also has 5-8 scph(server crashes per hour). I get it, its early access, I'm supposed to expect technical difficulties and issues, but not to a point that almost every server suffers from this and it kind of ruins the fun for me Tip: Pick a day to have a server maintenance. It works. Naval Action does it (and its Early Access). And expect lag. Lots of it. If you're fighting a dino and he has more latency than you do, he/she is going to win because your attacks won't register but that dino will and you will have to suffer the humiliation for it.\n\nThe problems go on and on and on. Wish I can write more but steam is being real sensative about reviews. Luckily I saved much so Im sorry to disappoint all looking foward to the game but no, just no. Wait for Saurian. Yes I know have over 600 hours. But honestly, I play because of the friends and the clan I have made. I mean I wanted to like this game, but with Levia fired, and tons of drama from the devs its making me go distant from the game further and further.","June 3","false","641.6"," 34 of 42 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","34","42","4","21"

The graphics are simply breath-taking and I couldn't wait to get this game.\n\nToo bad my computer can't display the high graphics. Still looks pretty good with everything on low.\n\n\nDinosaurs: 5/10 7/10 UPDATE\nThe dino's are lovely and most of them run pretty smooth. My main problem is the recent stat nerf. It's makes the game much harder for novice players like myself to hunt and find food. (I've even seen more senior members complain that it's much harder)\n\nI do kinda like the fact that you start out with low hunger and thirst, because it gives you a sense of urgency to hunt. But when you're a raptor and you need to find a pack quickly to successfully hunt, you have to sometimes run clear across the map to get there. With the stat nerf, it takes forever (even when sprinting 70% of the time) to get to a pack and you're near dead by the time you get there. (If something hasn't gotten you first.)\n\nEDIT: Now you start out with 50% hunger/thirst, and more stamina. +2\n\n\nCommunity: 7/10 6/10 UPDATE\nCommunity is kinda meh. Most people on the forums are pretty ok from what I've seen. When in game, though, it is highly recommended to stay with you're own species if you're a carnivore. Herbivores should either stick with their own kind or form small herds with other herbies. Or you can always form an 'oddball' pack with friends that you can communicate with via steam chat.\n\nEDIT: Community is kinda going downhill, in between players calling you carebear at every turn and many being insanely aggressive. Rather amusing to watch a herd of 5+ Shantu go out of their way to chase after 1 raptor that was merely trying to get to the forest behind them. -1\n\nDevelopers: 2/10 3/10 UPDATE\nNow to the main thing that inspired me to make a review.\n\nThe developers of the game are extremely rude and don't seem professional at all. Attending their streams proves that. They call their players idiots, losers, etc. They've even gone as far as to call some of the community 'cancerous'. If you say something about this, you are mocked.\nIt really makes one feel like that the devs don't care about our opinions and just wanted us for the money.\n\nStill, have to give them props for making a pretty good game.\n\nEDIT: The questions thread was a great addition. (And its actually going well) +1\n\n\nDespite all this, I still have some faith that this game can be great, but if I knew what I know now, I probably would have saved my money.\n\nOf course this is all merely my point of view, take it with a grain of salt. If you still think buying it is worth it, then go ahead. I'm not stopping you, just informing you.\n\n(Will be keeping this review up to date for the most part)","February 13","false","262.7"," 162 of 259 people (63%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","63","162","259","9","17"

Not to mention people like game developers should atleast go by what they say and be mature about it. "Watch the development livestream. Feel free to ask questions". Like why? So you can shut it down with a "No we don't want baby stages in the isle because ♥♥♥♥ babies.". For gods sake if your going to be a development team of a good game the least you could do is be mature about the damn thing. Specially when its serious questions about the future or current structure of the game. That goes with the fall damage... EVERYONE was disappointed and questioning it and they just left it in the blue OR they shut down everyones opinion and kept with the implementation of it. The one thing thats important about a kickstarter (which failed), and or public availability is to try to make a game as enjoyable for the community as well as meet the creator's dream of the game he wanted to make from the beginning. BUT that means there is a middle ground. In the end I used to enjoy it quite a lot... even donated 50 dollars (which I now regret). I thought this game had great potential but obviously with people like this running the game its quite a turn off and a huge disappointment. the main thing that I really really agree with is the community... its well TERRIBLE! An immature, trollish, and disoriented audience which is in no doubt confused with what they want. Literally not wasting a second of my life on this game until it gets better. Just not worth it. DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE PICS OR TRAILER ON THE STORE PAGE. Thats only a dream. For players to actually play the way shown on there. Its more like an FPS match on a war game than a simulation.

The models are great, the animations for the most part are smooth. This game already has a lot of cool content including quite a few different dinos to play as, Packs, variety of calls ranging from friendly to aggressive to even injured. I was enjoying my time playing the game until the other day. The game was stable and you could play for hours with your friends. Now, because the Devs got tired of people whining about wanting updates they've gone and slapped us with the Dev branch of the game. This is a good chance to help the devs find bugs and fix issues but the major problem with this is the servers are now about as stable as a drunk trying to walk in a straight line. There are server wide crashes every 10-15 mins with no save methods so you get plopped down at a random spawn upon logging back in. As far as I've been able to find the Devs have pretty much told the player base to deal with it. Sure, you can fix the game and go back to a previous load but that requires to you reinstall the game to do it. There will also only be about 3-4 other players to play with at a time. All in all, it's a fun game with great potential but until servers become stable and the Devs don't snap at their playerbase for asking for news when news is hard to find I wouldn't recommend this game. I'd recommend coming back a few months from now.","May 2","false","33.1"," 37 of 50 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","37","50","0","1"

Ever since I bought the game, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I made many friends over the game, and I got to watch development streams where what I could play in the future was being made from the ground up. In January I took a temporary hiatus as real life came into the way, and I returned some-time in Febuary \ Early March. I was immediately amazed by all that had been implemented since I last played, and I was super happy that the devs hadn't dropped the ball when it came to the game.\n\nBe it hunting with a pack of friends in a voice chat, and being complete and utter rebels; or even taking a night to play as one of my favorite herbivores just eating trees and bushes. The game, even if you are alone, has never been boring to me. (My proudest moment was back with the old Emerald rex skin, jumping a Diablo in Region 2 I do believe, and killing it before it could hit me. Back then, the little buggers had just become a thing and were very scary little murder-potatoes.)\n\nI've lead massive herds of triceratops, I've lead a conga-line of Shantungosaurus, and I've defended Puertasaurus from predators back when it was just a big, walking, stack of meat. I've been disappointed, I've been excited. Basically, the game has been a roller-coaster from the start, and it will probably still be one when it is truly finished.\n\nI absolutely adore how dedicated the team is to the game. They are all lovely folk, albeit blunt to people that ask repetitive questions that a simple google search would answer. Deathly's twitter is amazing and relatable, Dondi makes valid points and will give you valid life lesson speeches with Sledge while streaming him working on dino-ragdolls. All in all, despite having flaws as all humans do, they are all dedicated to getting the game finished and having it be one of the best successes in the dinosaur genre. Due to this, I respect them all greatly.\n\nI bought the game simply because I could chomp people as a carnivore, but I'm staying with this game purely because what they have planned is amazing, and I cannot wait to see it. Through the glitches such as Diabloceratops being the sonic of the ceratopsids, through the awkward moments of flying under the world while testing Quetzalcoatlus, through the amazing team coordination that can be found from players like Predatoria, CircleofLife, and many others.\n\nIf you want to be apart of a game that is rapidly developing and expanding to be something absolutely amazing, then buy The Isle.\n\nIn the future I plan on releasing my own skins once steam workshop has been implemented. This is a plan for a lot of artists in the community, be it those who are still learning digital art, to those that surpass me on every level. In this game, you will likely see some genuinely ground breaking mods in the future. I am purely expecting someone to turn all the dinosaurs into dragons at some point.\n\nThough for the vanilla game in whole, I am super excited to see what happens.\n","May 27","true","134.4"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","27","33","4","5"

It's awesome. Why is this game awesome? The dinosaur models are insane and cool with multi colour choices, as well as multi class choices. You can choose between being a herbavore or a carnivore, you may be bummed that there are only a few carnivores, but don't worry, some of your favourite predatorial dinosaurs are coming soon. This game is only in EARLY ACCESS stage, so there are lots of new dinosaurs and colours to come. The graphics are really intense, some people can't even play, but don't worry, just press ESC while in game, and go to Graphics. Turn textures and effects to low, and other stuff to medium, or to your liking. It still looks good on low graphics and textures, and this method reduces lag. Also if you do not have the right graphics card and you run the game and it brings up the following message: "You do not have the correct graphics card to play, therefore, the game may not run properly, do you wish to continue?" Just click yes and turn graphics to low when you get in game. Graphics problem is fixed, now you can play! W A S D to move, F to roar, 1 to give out a broadcasting roar, 2 to give out a roar showing you're friendly, 3 a threatening roar like challenging someone, 4 to give out a call that says: "Danger, danger! RUN!".\nYou can also pounce things as an austroraptor, just hold down left shift which is to sprint, run up to the tyrannosaurus rex then hold the left shift + space bar + right clicking. This will make you latch on the the rex, now right click and hold while you are attached to the rex to start biting. I recommend doing this at full stamina! There, I just gave you my thoughts and the control guide. Still don't want to play the game? Lets hope this convinced you. Only thing you need to watch out for, is the devs/developers of the game, they are mean, but just ignore them and play The Isle. Watch out for Dondi, he is a complete b****, if you are confused about one part of the game and ask him "How do you roar" He'll flip out at you. Don't talk to the devs, they are mean.

Does the game update frequently? Yes, it does. I'm giving a negative review because of development issues. This game has great potential, possibly being fun for people who aren't even into the whole "dinosaur games" thing. The game is based on survival, with dinosaurs (obviously) and things aren't always going to be balanced, I mean they shouldn't be considering it's including animals of all sorts of calibers. The problem is development and community. Many members of the community are unable to provide constructive feedback, allowing poor aspects of the game to proceed into newer builds, and the development has been less than professional about said issues and other aspects outside of player control.","February 18","false","106.3"," 32 of 45 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","32","45","0","0"

However, looking deeper, you can see that this game has a lot of potential behind what it says. The sheer fact that I can play a dinosaur gives this game +2 points, but the lack of content in the game at the moment (As of New Years Day 2016) gives this game a bad reputation. However, since the game is in early access, and the developers are clear about this fact, and when I mean clear I mean VERY CLEAR,  That deserves them some respect.\n\nSo moving on to the review. The Isle's concept is quite interesting, im looking very forward to playing the game once more content is added. I enjoy the idea of choosing between Human and Dinosaur, and I believe the interaction between these two will be quite a show. If you like high tech gear, go for the Mercs. If your like me and like to play primitive, go Tribemens. And if your like 90% of the player base, you'll be going Dinosaur. The variety of animals to choose from, along with the mysterious lore behind the game, gives the player a reason to come back and play this game over and over.\n\nThe developers are trustworthy. If your a TSL veteren (Refering to anyone who played TSL, really) like me, then you'll understand how a untrustworthy developer can ruin a game so easy. However, Dondi (The developer) is a great guy, who updates the game regularly, and even pops up on the servers to chat. Seriously, Im not joking, he really does. The rest of the team is also great, I even saw that Aphro, who moderated the TSL forums, is in the dev team now. +5 Trust Points.\n\nSo in conclusion, I will state this very clearly for those of you who can't make up there mind: Buy this game only, and I mean ONLY, if your willing to lay down the money to watch this game develop, give feedback, and just enjoy the game in general. If we the playerbase don't contribute, this game will never flourish to what we want it to be. I shall give this game a postive review, because I do enjoy this game.","January 1","true","264.6"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","28","38","0","0"

Seriously, don't. Developers are honestly pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and really not the people you want to be talking to.\n\nHowever! For an Early Access game, The Isle definitely delivers once you can get past the inevitable bugs. Beautiful dinosaur models and an immersive experience and downright addictive when you join a realism server (Jotunheimr for example, which I highly reccommend you join!) for RP purposes.\n\nMechanics are reasonably well balanced and the controls are simple and easy to remember. Definitely not the game for the "charge into battle headfirst" type of player however, as you'll need to plan out your offensive/defensive manuevers when hunting prey/evading predators even on public, non-RP servers.\n\nAll in all, it's a pretty awesome game for something still relatively early in development. The bleeding/leg breaking mechanics add a realistic level of danger and definitely succeeds in putting yourself in the shoes of an extinct animal overrall.","May 18","true","148.5"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","28","38","2","1"

The Isle is very much a work in progress. There are bugs, and it can be frustrating at times, but it is steadily being updated and progressing at a rather quick pace compared to most Early Access games.\n\nFor a game with dinosaurs, it is the best at this moment in time. The models are great! While not all of them a realistic they cater to the fans of realism and fiction. If you want to be a feathered Rex you can! Soon you can be a scaled Rex (young, sub-adult and adult!)! The same with the eventual addition of Utahraptor. There will be a realistic feathered version and a Jurassic Parkish one. And it is also super fun to take a break from all the butt munching to relax (but not entirely) as one of the many herbivores!\n\nThere is not much to do other than PvP right now and because of this the balancing of dinos can seem, well, unbalanced. That is because, in the future, there will a progression system implemented. Where you will start off as the weakest creature of the playstyle you want. Carnivore or herbivore. Which is the base of your tree that branches off into many species.\n\nTo get the current super carnivores (Rex/Carno) or super herbivores (Puerta/Trike/Galli/ Shantu) each that is the best at its lifestyle will not be quick or easy. It does say on the store page this game will be hardcore. However, for now, they are all easy to access which means everyone, and their mom is playing as them. In the future, it will not be this way.\n\nLastly, there will be playable human and human-ish races. Survivors, Mercenaries, Tribals and Cannibals! Each will have their own playstyle. Survivors will, well, have to survive. Mercenaries will be more FPS. They will be able to tame some small dinosaurs, get jeeps and helicopters. Tribals will be the tamers and be able to tame nearly every dinosaur on the island, even player controlled dinos!\n\nIn the end, I think this game, with so much versatility, is easily worth the price. However, if you can't stand bugs, do not have the patience to wait for fixes, and take things too personally both in the game and in the discussion I would HIGHLY recommend you wait to buy until the game is finished.\n\nI would also recommend not buying this game if you do not meet minimum requirements (obviously), and you are under the age of 18. While the game is not rated at the moment, it IS a mature game.\n\nNow if you pass all that and happen to like following the development of games and seeing how it grows I can easily recommend it for you!\n\nI hope this helps you to decide on your purchase and I hope to meet you in The Isle!","February 1","true","205.0"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","77","24","31","18","2"

Imagine if you had packs of smart raptors trying to cunnigly hunt you down or 1 or 2 berserk T-Rexes chaching you. It would add stress to the game and keep you on your toes.

However I spotted some issues maybe the devs can help fix.\n\nI'm only stating the issues in my opinion and it's not to cause any harm towards others nor is it a complaint. I have this in the suggestions box and have copied and pasted it here for all to see!\n\nHere are my personal issues at hand with the game:\n\nFirst Issue, is that at spawn we should have a minute invunerability or at least a speed boost when we spawn in because let me tell you how many crappy people love sitting at spawn and killing people just because they are there. In fact right when I spawn in I get killed instantly without second thought. I know the world was brutal back then but not that brutal.\n\nSecond issue I have. The map is waaaaay too big not to have a map or some way of telling what is what. I understand it's suppose to be a world of awesomeness and just go do it kind of thing but reading cords is very confusing for people like myself who are dyslexic. I'm the kind of dyslexic that had there words and numbers flip backward and can't flip them back. It's a very bad disorder so if you could please make it do we can hit like the m button for a translucent map or something that would be appreciative.\n\nThird Issue I have. Why is it the carnivores can crouch and we herbi's can't! I get they are predators but sometimes we try to talk to other herbi's and our crouch button is missing so we have to guess who is who isn't attacking. Crouching is actually how we learned to communicate as carnivores to tell who is friendly and who is not too. The same should be for herbavores.\n\nForth Issue. I have stated this before and just to make sure it's covered again. There is just not enough Herbavores to go around these days to supply the carnivores with enough meat. In fact the maps are so large it's hard to find a player. The one day it took me two to three hours to find one player and they killed me as a shanti even though I was a harmless theri. Putting my grumpiness of that aside it still leads down to the biggest problem. You can still have pvp and have more ai's running about. Hell half the time if a rex spots another player they like the chase instead of a standing still ai. In fact what one could do is if the rex is near by and is heard the ai can simply start running making the rex think of ways to sneak up. I mean they have a crouch button for good reason as stated before.\n\nLast and finally not least my last issue. There is no last issue! In fact the last is actually a compliment. I play ark survival. I love playing it and for some reason this game caught my attention. Now I know why. Unlike ark survival it's not as laggish and the art style is beautiful even on low settings. Best part is I can run this game on high settings and only lag a small bit. A game that is this well made and still allows me to play at least on medium is very well off in my book. Another thing the game actually doesn't crash on me what so ever which is nice since Ark for some reason still loves to do it. Very well done devs and your game! For Early Access this will be a game worth buying!\n\nAnyone reading this I thank so much. I try not to make complaints or call names as it's being a bad sport if I do. Also i know very well this is a very very early access game which can cause problems. Which is why the devs were kind enough to all us to play on it even though they didn't have to. At times there are times I want to cuss in chat because of some of these issues. However, how much you want to bet I'll still be playing this game for days to come. I just hope others enjoy it as well even though it's simple as it tis. I recommend this game to dino and pvpers alike who just want to hang out and have a good time. Maybe even a dev or two to come say hello as we would love to have you around!\n\nIf I did anything wrong in this post let me know as this is only m yfirst time reviewing the game. I am dyslexic so reading things can sometimes get me in to trouble due to the fact I get confused. If i need to I will change or delete the post if it offends!","January 8","true","35.6"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","21","28","0","1"

There isn't much content, nor much to do, but what is here is absolutely brilliant. The six species we have at the moment are all beautifully modeled and animated, the move smoothly, with one minor exception I'll get into later, and they play fairly well. The only real issue I have is that the transition between quadruped and biped stances for Shantungosaurus are a bit to quick for my taste, given the size of the animal, but I can look past it as it's more of a nitpick than anything. There are clipping issues, and the hitboxes on some things seem abit off, but given the current state I'll let these slide for the time being\n\nThe servers I will admit are somewhat problematic and prone to random drops, though this could just be my internet, but they're much more active than I expected, so that's a plus. I have yet to see any roleplaying either, which is another bonus. I personally have nothing against it, I myself have done it on Primal Carnage, but on a game like this there's no excuse for it. The biggest worry I have now is balance. While the majority of the classes seem to be somewhat balanced, I'm worried the Puertosaurus is too strong. I'll have to get a group of T. rex's together to try hunting one and see if it's possible to kill it, but if not that seems to be something to be worried about if everyone just goes Puerto.\n\nAs for planned features, I am hesitent on the ideas of skill tree and strains, but I'll turn a blind eye on them for now since we know very little about them. I am curious about the human factions and how they'll play out, especially cannibals. The thing I'm most excited about is the new animals coming. We already have Titanoboa, Queztalcoatlus, Dilophosaurus, Spinosaurus, Therizinosaurus, Deinonychus, Megaraptor, Tupandactylus, Helicoprion/Parahelicoprion, Diabloceratops, and Acrocanthosaurus as confirmed animals, and it's heavily hinted that we well get Diplodicus as well, in addition to some for of crocodilian and stegosaurid. That's quite the list, 15 total, in addition to the 6 we already have, for a grand total of 21 genus's.\n\nAll in all, the current state of the game is really fun if your patient. I can look back the admited lack of content and annoying bugs as the game is playable. They've done alot to try and smooth it out since launch, with 5 patches alrealy released, which is doing wonders for my confidence in the dev's. Is the game perfect? Far from it. Is it worth trying in it's current state? That depends. I'll admit $20 is a high asking price for it, so if you wanna get it best either doing so now while it's on sale or waiting for more content. But it is fun and I see good things in it's future.\n\n\nFinal verdict NA/5 ( Holding my rating untill some more cotent comes out.)","December 3, 2015","true","173.8"," 27 of 39 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","27","39","0","0"

Primal Carnage, for example, which promised to be a competitive shooter with a serious tone, is little more than a clutter of roleplay and modded servers now. And don't even get me started on the Orion... Series? (More like one terrible apology after another.) Also, The Stomping Land, which is in fact where The Isle repurposed its dinosaur models from after that game utterly failed.\n\nBeing that The Isle is early access, I can only compare what the game offers now to what it promises. I already have some concerns about it, such as an overload of skins. This concerns me because Primal Carnage seemed more concerned with aesthetics than gameplay, and it resulted in a terribly balanced game that, as aforementioned, resulted in little more than a clutter of roleplay and modded servers. However, it is my understanding that at least one and maybe a few developers who worked on Primal Carnage are involved with The Isle, and so while this might sound scary, there is another way to look at this: they realized that roleplay and mods are what dinosaur gamers want! We don't necessarily want to run around getting killed by humans--or conversely run around as humans killing dinosaurs--all the time, and that was the mistake Primal Carnage made, and Orion too for that matter (although Orion made far many more mistakes than just that, so I admit it's a cheap comparison). All we want is just to be a dinosaur. Is that too much to ask for?\n\nAccording to The Isle, no, it is not too much to ask for! In the game's current state, The Isle provides players with the opportunity to herd/pack, eat, drink, fight, and explore as one of several dinosaurs in landscapes that even in early access are already beautiful. Even as simple as the game is now, I still can't get enough of it. It's like being in a dream, but instead of having to wrestle with insomnia all I have to do is boot up The Isle.\n\nThis in no way dismisses the responsibility of the developers to fulfill the promises they've made for this game. It is supposed to be so much more than it currently is, and obviously that's why it's merely early access, but I am recommending this game both for its current playability value and the potential it has. If you think the concerns I mentioned are worth holding off on this game, it's literally only $20. You spend more than that on one meal for two people at Taco Bell. The game is fun as is, so despite my concerns about its potential I still think it's worth checking out.","December 25, 2015","true","36.2"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","23","32","3","0"

Thurston","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198024480105/","96 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n(HEAVILY TEIRD AND EDITED REVIEW, SKIP TO LAST EDIT FOR MOST UP TO DATE VIEWS!!!)\nnot that many reviews and the few i see that are positive just say "i had 1 fun experience for a couple hours and this game is amazing cause i can dinosaur" This game is not worth its current value. It is EXTREMELY early access and currently broken in every askpect. All dinos are player controled so it can get extremely hectic at times and just annoying the rest of the times. Example: Carnavores and Herbavores teaming up and just roaming while chatting breaks any sense of competition; Spawn camping groups of carnotaurs and T-Rex's; Herbavores that can 1-shot T-Rexs. Im sure alot of these things will be fixed in the future and it will take time to develope this game as it seems the developement team is very small, however that still doesnt excuse the fact that this seems little more than a dino walking simulator. Not worth purchasing right now but worth keeping an eye on. Im sure in a year if it is still in developement there will be alot more depth and interesting content that would make this game worth buying but as of now it is not.\n\n(EDIT): Went back to try and give it another shot and give it a bit more time to shine but the game refuses to even let me play as it keeps kicking me off servers after 1-2 min online. Restarting the game doesnt help either. This is unplayable ATM.\n\n(2'nd edit) Also if you want a dinosaur simulator, Ark: Survival evolved has a mod that allows you to play as a dinosaur instead of a person and there are servers that run that mod so that you can play pretend dino all you want + it has WAaaaaay more dinos and an easier to navigate and more fleshed out map.\n\n(3'rd Edit) Upon doing some more background info and the suggestion of several people on forums, this game that we are playing is not the game they are developing. more a testing ground and skeleton to get the basic functionality in then they can later utilize and impliment their work. While this process makes sense and i can support their work in such a way it is still missleading to the consumer and at this stage in the game it seems like it will give them more bad rep and make it harder to sell the game once its completed. i would rather support the games creation on a greenlight or some other site that way they have the funds needed to continue the creation then sell the game on steam when its in beta and not super extra early access alpha like it currently is. Still a thumbs down do not buy it as it is nowhere near playable but i would still keep an eye on this games developement.\n\n(4th edit) Been keeping up in the games dev and it doesnt feel like they are making a game, it feels like this is us paying to let them just make models and animated them. There is no survival to be had here just walking still with the occasional drink/eat if ur an herbo or wander and starve if your a carno. IDK how large is this dev team?  if its like 1-3 ppl i completely understand and it kinda changes my view on it but if its 10+ ppl then this is rediculous. Updates take forever to come out and when they do little is changed or done. yay whoopee they added in a ui, even though it took em months to make a simple UI for their game. Still not worth it. i dont think it will even be worth it in a year as games like ARK will be finnished by then and have a large modding community pushing out even more content by then.

Otherwise a sub-10 fps gaming experience will be what you can expect and it is not fun. The game has a LLLOOONNNGGG ways o go in that respect. Its an early access game so obviously there isn't much to it at all. The lack of any real gameplay gets real old real fast. Not so much when its not just you but even being with a group of players you can only talk to some of them because of the only chat option is species only which really took the game down a notch for me honestly. This game has a lot of potential though in that many, many, many extinct creatures will be brought into this game over the years. Plus humans are in the near future as well as these mutant Orc looking things.\n\nThat being said...\n\nMany of the devs are not capable of acting in a professional manner towards their playerbase. I've seen quite a few dev streams, seen many screenshots, read many reviews and read many posts on both forums. They are quite rude and admit to being trolls. They more specifically openly make fun of players with physical and mental disabilites(especially autism) as well as using the f word when referring to gay players. Anyone who says they are just joking around when making such statements clearly don't know the history of these individuals. Oh and they love handing out lifetime forum and game bans for what pretty much any normal person would classify as a minor offence committed either ingame or on the forums. That is the opposite of proper behavior and actions of a developer indie or not. Disgusting.\n\nIf the latter wasn't true then I would totally recommend this game. But obviously MANY people know otherwise from their own firsthand experience. And as said above there is a lot good about the actual game itself(well eventually at least) but in this case the latter of course has to outweigh the former.\n\nSo, as long as certain people are still able to interact with this community I can not morally or ethically recommend this game.","February 10","false","134.8"," 86 of 147 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","86","147","3","10"

Though you can say there isn't any solid/structured gameplay at the moment, it still is fun. It's especially relly fun when you find a player and you slowly stalk them awaiting the perfect time to ambush them and go for the kill.\n\nThings to note that the game currently has as of writing this review:\n\n-Very good, fluid, and realistic dinosaur animation and movement\n-Different dinosaurs to play as, along with multiple skins to choose from\n-A very large map to explore\n-AI/NPCs that roam the map. Currently the AI is super basic, but it will be greatly improved soon\n-Day/Night cycle\n-Structures around the map that one could explore\n-In-Game chat\n-Awesome sounds for dinosaurs\n- Alot more\n\nFor information on future content, view the Early Access info/FAQ page. It's ontop of the buy option.\n\nThe devs are very active and are always communicating with the community. The demo had constant updates, sometimes multiple per day, the EA version will be the same;especially now since they have a way to fund their game. They even host twitch streams of the development and progress of the game which is an awesome thing, and is a cool oppertunity to get further involved with the project.\n\nShould you get this game?\n\nThat question depends on you.\n\nRight now the game is still very early in development, so don't expect the game to have a ton of content. So buy this game if you wish to help FUND the project and SUPPORT the devs, and to HELP TEST the game out as it develops.\n\nIf you are not satisfied, wait a few weeks or months and come back to check on the progress.\n\nWill the developers abandon this project?\nNO THEY WILL NOT! After their kickstarter failed, the devs continued to develop the game even though they were broke. They spent countless hours working on the game to make it a success and get it to where it is now. Their effort is evidence that they will do whatever it takes to make sure that this game succeeds.\n\nEdit:\n\nSo now I played for a few hours and had alot of fun as a rex. The map is really big so it was easy to find players, but I came across about 12 in around an hour. Alot of them I spotted and slowly hunted them until I was able to ambush them and kill em >:D . I later found a rex pack and was able to kill all but 1. So far the game has been really fun! Alot of interesting things around the map to explore and see.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nWow I just had a ton of fun.\n\nThere's a faction/conquest war going on between Rexes, Raptors, and Herbivores in the NY server.\n\nEach specie have started packs, and taking over numerous outposts throughout the game, and claiming it as their territory.\n\nThere was a giant raptor pack at this one outpost (we called it the Capital). Literally any intruder got decimated. Until, soon enough, the Rexes began an uprising. Soon enough, the majority of the pack got killed from a TRex ambush. Then, a bigger ambush took place. The capital was lost, that place became Rex territory,\n\nThen there was a back and forth between control of the outpost, but in the end the raptors found a new home.\n\nThe Rexes had, earlierl, taken over the first and original raptor outpost (seperate from capital). So rexes and raptors became #1 enemies.\n\nSo the conquest wars continued and are most likely still going on right now.\n\nThis game currently doesn't have any structured/solid gameplay. But when the players make up their own gameplay, then things get very interesting.","December 1, 2015","true","17.2"," 39 of 62 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","39","62","5","0"

This game is actually pretty decent.\n\nIt is very barebones at the moment, as the most you can really do is just wander around and devour everything in your sight, which has yet to become boring.\n\nObviously it's going to be a long road ahead for this game to really get on its feet, but so far so good I'd say. The dinosaurs are modelled and animated beautifully, and the map itself is a fantastic marvel to explore. You'll find yourself admiring scenery often. I do wish the jungles were a little more dense to allow for better ambushing for the predators, but that's a minor nitpick.\n\nThe optimization is very good, much better than other early access games (looking at you ARK), I have a vegetable of a computer and it's able to run this game very smoothly, lag free, and I have not experienced a crash as of yet.\n\nThe problems are mostly minor, but they're there. Carnivores run rampant on the map. Herbivores are for the most part powerless against the predatory dinosaurs. Especially the Rex, who appears to be the most OP at the moment. A formidable herbivore is something that's desperately needed. A ceratopsian or an ankylosaur would be stellar. The Carnotaurus also seems rather lacking, it just appears to be a slightly faster much weaker version of the Rex.\n\nThe biggest problem I see with the game in its current state is the price tag. It's not worth 20$, I'm just gonna flat out say it. On a good day you can buy fully finished games with dozens of hours of content for 20$.\n\nAs it stands this is a must have for dinosaur fans, although anyone who's not a hardcore reptilian fanatic is probably going to find themselves bored with the game in its current state. Aside from just being a dinosaur, (which is incredibly cool don't get me wrong) there's not really much game yet.\n\nCan't wait to see what's in store.\n\nReally sorry to say, but I've had to edit my review on this game.\n\nIn the recent months they have shown some very real progress and have pumped out some seriously cool updates, and really seem to be on top of development. The game has become quite a lot more enjoyable with the addition of new gameplay mechanics and new playable species.\n\nHowever they had to ruin any chance of praise by the repugnant treatment of one of the developers, who they are, amongst other things, refusing to pay. I can not, and will not support developers with such disgraceful practices.\n\nDevs get your act together and fix this problem.

At the point of this review, the game is but a shadow of what it has promised to become, but already I find myself coming back for more! Skulking around 'The Isle', as one of the creatures that the game currently contains, offers immersion within a prehistoric world that to me, is unrivalled. Want to explore as one of the Isles smaller herbivore dinosaurs like the Gallimimus? You can do that. Fancy teaming up with a group of friends as a pack of raptors and stalking other players together planning the best oppurtunity for a take down? Go crazy. More of a lone wolf who's looking to dominate all of the other players as the massive T-rex? Why not. Although right now the game doesn't have heaps of options in terms of things to do, for what it does right now, it does it very well, with a strong feel of immersion and survival, mixed with perhaps the PVP of games like Primal carnage, and I always find myself completely consumed into the world!

I haven't seen much info on them, but from what I hear they are supposed to be mutated dinosaurs like the ones from Dino Crisis 3. so there will be fictional creatures in the future.\n\nThere will be something called a Progression System added sometime in the future that allows you to level up the dinosaur you're playing as. increase your health, attack, and stamina until you're top of the food chain as the apex.\n\nOnce all dinosaurs have been finished, no where on the map will be safe. the land will have T-Rexes and Raptors, the rivers will have Titanoboas and Deinosuchuses, the air will have Quetzalcoatlus and Pteranodons, and even the oceans will have Mosasaurs and Dunkleosteus. keep alert at all times or else you'll be someone's dinner.\n\nBut like I said, this game is still in development and so a few things I talked about are not available at the moment. but if you're looking for a video game where you play as a dinosaur in a world of dinosaurs, I suggest you give The Isle a try.","March 17","true","119.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evello/recommended/376210/","evello","Evello","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evello/","157 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI just bought this game today and I've had a ton of fun playing it so far.\n\nThe gameplay so far is admittedly very simple. You walk around, press E to eat/drink, press F to roar, and left click to attack. There's just something about the fact that you're walking around, eating and roaring as a DINOSAUR. The animations are beautiful and smooth, which definitely makes the experience more enjoyable. There's no real goal, other than to explore, meet people, maybe attack some things, maybe run away from things.\n\nThere are problems with the game, of course. It's early access, and that's accepted. As a raptor, sometimes you get stuck in the "pounce" position and you're sliding around on your tail with your little claws up in the air as you grin as everyone you pass. The puertasaurus definitely has some work that's needed, but from what I know it's just a placeholder, and honestly I spent most of my time playing as a puerta. They move achingly slow, they cannot deal damage, and they get caught on trees they could realistically step right over. However, when you're walking a quarter mile an hour with three rexes, a carno, two raptors, and a galli circled around you like your own private carnivore army, it's pretty fun just to walk around and enjoy the scenery. Just remember not to go into the trees, because you'll get a face full of foliage.\n\nThe other dinosaurs are also fun, though carnivores seem to be the most powerful at the moment. It's hard to make dinos realistic while also balancing, because herbivores travel in herds and carnivores are usually on their own. However, instead you end up with packs of 6 rexes against 2 gallis and there's not much you can do about it. There are some balancing issues; rexes are probably the most powerful, rivaled by the raptor solely because of their pouncing ability. Raptors can pounce and latch onto larger dinosaurs, and there's no way to get them off once they're on. There should be a way to shake them off, or make it more difficult for the raptor to stay attached. Herbivores could definitely use a buff; if they have no defenses, they need to be faster than rexes. Otherwise, they need defenses.\n\nOther things I'm hoping for is perhaps a minimap, a health bar, a hunger bar, and of course flying dinosaurs. I would also love some underwater dinos but I realize that's a whole new environment with a whole new set of coding rules and that could be a far way off. I'm really excited to see where this game goes, as it's a lot of fun to play even as it is now.","December 6, 2015","true","5.8"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/verfonia/recommended/376210/","verfonia","Verfonia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/verfonia/","7 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEarly Access Game	A lot of people have trouble buying an early access game because they are afraid it wont be finished and I have no doubts this game will be finished. The Devs are working hard and the general dev has put his heart and soul into this and seeing what his hard work has made is amazing. Updates are regular and if you want to connect with more people before buying the game feel free to go and watch the developement on Twitch [https://www.twitch.tv/thedondi/profile]\n\nDinosaurs	The models in The Isle are fantastic to say the least. A few of them were purchased from the Stomping Land but other than that they are all original. Animations are smooth (even on my crappy laptop) and really bring these prehistoric creatures to life. A few people complain that there are not enough dinosaurs however (I don't like using this excuse) this game is in early access and more are to come.\n\nMultiplayer	The multiplayer is a HUGE aspect to The Isle, because it is only multiplayer (duh). The community is great with its share of bad apples but if you can over look that then you are golden! Most people will jump to help a new player and are always up to meet up and hunt or graze together but be wary as a carnivore, you may not mean any harm to a herb when trying to get to water but they tend to be a bit overprotective and many (sadly) most will attempt to kill you.\n\nDevelopers	I'm going to clear any worries you have about the devs. When people say they don't recommend The Isle it's mostly because of the "unprofessional" developers and how they treat the players. I agree they could treat people with a little more respect but we can also adapt to that by growing thicker skins. They are also very unprofessional but this is an indie game created by a rag-tag team of people who do what they do because they love it. There is a trade off to having a personal connection to the team and not. If you do not fallow the teams developement through Twitch and stay on the forums you will find a more professional side of the devs (unless you ask a something asked 100 times already) but if you go on Twitch and have the ability to play on a server with them you will find they are more open and tend to fool around more. It's up to you how you want to portray them but if you can't enjoy the game because you can't handle a little heat then this is not the game for you.\n\nSystem Requirements	I will say this game needs more than your average laptop can handle. Despite that fact I play it on a laptop because im cheap and love the game too much to let a little lag and low settings to ruin my day. Understand that if you buy this game and use an everyday computer you will never get the most out of it and don't complain that it isn't optimized enough because trust me they have optimized the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. Too many people come on and say something about how they can't play the game properly because one reason or another but we all have this struggle so please keep it to your self (I mean this in the nicest of ways).\n\nSummary	The Isle is a good game and this review turned more into a rant than anything but I hope it helped. If you have any questions feel free to slide into my DMs.","March 8","true","359.0"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

Stranded; cold and alone, desperately hungry, a young Allosaurus finds me calling for help and immediately befriends me. He remains by my side and escorts me to the wondrous Spawn Lake where many of our kind amassed around a huge watering hole. We are greeted warmly by the carnivorous community and join their circle. I feast and drink my fill, nestling down beside my Allo friend and rest for a while. Soon enough my leg has mended and a raptor joins the community of Rexes and Allosaurs. Sure enough he pounces me, but a meal was not what he sought. I gave the little fellow the ride of his life, and he seemed to be thankful of it; chirping at me playfully before running off back to the pack. However, while I was distracted a herd of herbivores  had stormed the pack and taken the life of my dear Allo friend! Overcome with despair at the sight of my friend's lifeless corpse, my rage took hold and retribution was all that I could muster in my heart. Watching the culprit, a wounded stegosaurus, waddle away with his herd, I knew what had to be done...\n\nI took vengeance upon the beast and avenged my fallen comrade. Finally, it was over... Balance had been restored. Sufficed to say I didn't last very long before they surrounded me, and I shared the same fate."\n\n10/10 would dramasaurus rex again!\n\nOn to the actual review...\n\nFor so long I've been looking for a game that includes dinosaurs, whereby the player takes control of the dinosaur! Ever since 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' that debuted in 1997 for the PS1, I've been searching for a game of similar qualities, and while The Isle is not Jurassic Park this game certainly exceeds expectations!\n\nAs a young girl I adored dinosaurs, and that love persists to this day. While The Isle is still currently in early access, what I've seen of the game so far is breathtaking. The graphics are on point and visually astonishing while the animations are fluid and realistic. They mimic flawlessly the movements of what one can expect of these prehistoric creatures, along with the sounds composed bring them to life. While game play outside of the sandbox/survival paradigm is currently nonexistent, the game is regularly and consistently being updated. Bugs are being addressed day-by-day, and while crashes are inevitable at such an early stage of the game's development, the developers are passionate and dedicated about their work.\n\nI expect great things to come of this game. I can only hope the original concept is not skewed by further updates and the addition of human assets.\n\nThe community varies from server to server; overall I've made some good friends playing The Isle and look forward to meeting more like minded individuals who enjoy this game as much as I do. Nevertheless, The Isle requires much more work before it pulls itself from status of early access, supporting the developers now is a great way to ensure that this game reaches its full potential.","May 27","true","61.5"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","13","17","5","1"

Should changes be made, either positive or negative, they will most likely be mentioned in this review.\n\nAs amazing as this game is, and with all the potential it has....I just can't get past the community. The Devs, the players, they're all such toxic, immature, degenerates that it truely makes me not enjoy playing this game. I only have ~50 hours in the game, and I'm already so turned off by the community, I'm considering dropping this game until it makes it out of early release.\n\nThat being said, for a fairly new E.A. title, the game itself isn't too bad. Yes, there's the usual array of assorted bugs of varying type and sevarity that's expected with early access. But once you get past those, the game really is pretty amazing, and again....so much potential!\n\nFinal two cents: If you can deal with a plethora of jack-asses, children, trolls, and gaggles of griefers who don't care who they target....then by all means, please support this game. If you can't deal with the genral ♥♥♥♥♥♥ness of humans with the power of internet annonymity, then avoid this till it's further into development.

One of my favorite games on steam at the momment.\n\nThe isle is an early access open world survival game where you play as a dinosaur (humans and pterosaurs will be added as well).  The Isle is an amazing game if you are a paleonerd (such as myself) because The Isle's dinosaurs are pretty accurate and featherd. It's nice to see a game that actually cares about dinosaurs...( Ark: Survival Evolved )\n\nThe Isle's gameplay can be fun and fast paced and boring and slow paced, depending on how many people is on the server and what creature you choose to play as. The gameplay is great but can be clumpsy at certain times. But keep in mind that this is an early access game, so there will be many changes in the future.\n\nThe graphics are semi-good in my opinion. There are a few graphical glitches here and there that will probably be patched in the future. The game runs pretty well, at least on a GeForce GTX 780.\n\nI really reccomend this game if you love dinosaurs and  open world survival.\n\n\n(Btw the game looks better than it shows in the trailer on steam)","May 3","true","41.3"," 31 of 51 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","31","51","0","0"

I fell the back of the pack and very quickly attacked the TRex at the rear, killing him in just a few hits. Before the front one could figure out what I did, I pounced on him.

The game is bare bones, containing nothing but a few dinos (7 of them), the ability to kill/hurt each other, and a simple hunger/thirst system. Things are slowly being added to the game, but I honestly would not count on things getting very far. The biggest problems with the game isn't with the game itself, but with the people involved with it. The devs (mostly the lead one) has made some poor decisions and they do not think highly of their consumers. Even the ones who fiercely defend them.

Don Wittich, or "Dondi" if you know him by his online handle, promised a great dinosaur game after leaving the Primal Carnage team, and for what it is, The Isle is a fantastic game. With updates constantly being dished out and new features and concepts being developed as we speak, even in the game's early access state, the game has nowhere to go but up. There are a few annoying player tropes, like "Carebears", but as annoying as they are, they pale in comparison to the sheer enjoyment you will get out of this game. I may or may not update this guide as new features are updated into the game, but as of now, with all the content the game offers in the multiple updates that have transpired since the game's release, I think I can make my verdict.\n\nFinal Verdict - 7/10, The game is fantastic so far, but as of the time of writing this review, much more content is to be added to the game than the content it has as of yet, so I can't give it much more than a 7/10.\n\nATTENTION - While the developers may be callous and even down right rude at times, the reviews should be focused on the game itself, not the developers, and besides, you kind of have to give em' props for making a decent game.","March 9","true","79.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","2"

Now, i'm a picky person when it comes to dinosaur games and this game is just everything i've wanted from a game like this. This game is actually quite unique so far and still has lots of potential as much is planned for the future. I would really recommend this game even at this state of Early Access. This game is fun and you can play as pretty much all the dinosaurs you loved as a child and more, as well as being able to choose from different factions to be added such as the Mercs and the Cannibals including the Dinosaurs. All factions play differently and require different techniques to survive. I also love the challenge of this game as there are no tutorials and no hints/tips and this feature might also encourage you to socialise with other players to ask what to do.

Hands down, BEST dino simulation game I have ever played.   It might not be complete, but that doesn't make it any less amazing.  The graphics are perfect, the animations are perfect, and the fact that you get to play with other people world-wide instead of NPC's makes the game that much more fun.\n\nYou can create herds and migrate around massive maps just like the real dinos would, and defend each other from predators that wanna' snack on you.

Circle the prey, then go for the kill once it's confused and can't react quick enough.\n\nIn my opinion, the creators of this game deserve every penny for this game.

Currently Dino's spawn in and have the ability to eat and drink pressing E, to run holding shift and jump (if they are able to jump) by pressing space bar. Their only perceivable objective is to eat, drink and fight other dino.\n\nSimple right and left click attacks means combat currently is a circle strafe button bash until someone falls over or runs away, its clumsy and somthing I hope they will improve on heavily if this game is going to reach its full potential. Stealth mechanics, element of suprise, persistant injuries from battle. These are some of the things I would like to see implemented, only time will tell.\n\nThe maps are also apaulling, a big draw to a game like this will be exploration. The current maps are terrible and make the whole game feel rushed. The Dino skins themselves are awsome, however they are been taken from a previous project known as the stomping grounds so really what we have to see for our investment so far is the menu/server listings and the maps which are sub-standard even for EA at this point in time.\n\nLooking forward. If they implement some of the aspects of the game they have stated this might turn out to be an amazing game. As it stands right now, its little more than an engine you can spawn some dino entites in. I'll be keeping an eye on the project and I will be updating this review with my own experiances as and when updates happen.\n\nCurrently I would recommend you do not purchase the game unless you want to invest into the ideas and concepts of what this game COULD become in a year from now.","December 23, 2015","false","1.3"," 27 of 44 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","27","44","0","0"

However due to the low population, it becomes a walking simulator, even with a server full of people, all you do is walk and walk, while you can send your co-ordinates to help people locate you or find a herd, it still doesn't help with the main issue I have which is too much walking.\n\nThe island is dull too, I mean the amount of trees and plants are fine, but the amount of creatures in them are too low, NPCs are hard to come by and there's no insects on the flowers, birds flying past or small mammals running around on the floor, it would be a nice touch but I can understand why they aren't added. Plus a lot of the areas look the same, so without a map, it's easy to get lost.\n\nThey have said that they will add more intresting stuff, like Quetzalcoatlus which is a giant flying reptile and other stuff, so I suggest you pick this up later when it becomes more finished and more known, and I will do the same, I got a refund for this game and chances are, I will buy it again in the future, there is brilliant stuff in here and lots of potential, just not now though which sucks because I want to love this game.","January 2","false","0.8"," 39 of 67 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","39","67","0","5"

Even though it's in early access at the moment, the dinosaur models look great and the different skins/textures look amazing on them. The animations are fluid, the controls are simple and work well. The only thing lacking at the moment is actual content, but that is to be expected since this game is in a very early Alpha stage. The only thing you can do as of now is select a dinosaur (which is limited to only 4 types at the moment), explore the island (which is ENORMOUS) and hunt other dinos (depending on whether you're a carnivore or not). And even though some people may think that an enormous map is great, it becomes null and void when it's completely empty and you can't find any other players. With no mini-map system in place, you'll find yourself aimlessly wandering around the massive world with nothing to do and no one to interact with. But I will admit that on the rare occasion that you DO find another dinosaur, it feels pretty awesome to fight them or just hang out with them and form your own herd.\n\nMy final input will be this: if you're looking for a polished game right off the bat, you're going to be disappointed if you buy it now. While I don't regret my purchase, I suggest that any potential buyers out there wait for a more updated version before getting this game, because with the state it's in, I think a more reasonable asking price would be around $10-$12. But if the developers hold their own in the end and release the final game with all of the features that they promised, then it will definitely be worth the $21.","December 6, 2015","true","12.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I don't usually buy early access, but I would highly recommend this one. The team updates often, responds to posts, and takes consideration of the players thoughts. The only downsides are the players themselves so far. There's the usually trolls who enjoy ruining the game for others and spawn killing, but once you get to know the majority of players and learn the basics of the game those few unfortunates just become the usual ones to kill off. On that note BE RESPECTFUL! This game is played by certain players often and if you make a bad reputation for yourself it won't be quickly forgotten. The dino's are diverse, each feels like a different gameplay, and more is to be added.

This game is still in early development, so a player only has the ability to play a herbivore or carnivore, for now. In the future, they are going to add playable humans (cannibals, tribals, mercernaries, etc.)\n\nWhen you start out in the game, you have the ability to pick the species of dinosaur you want to play. The choices are Austroraptor, Carnotaurus, Tyrannosaurus, Allosaurus, and Suchomimus for carnivores, while the herbivores get the choices of Dryosaurus, Maiasaura, Triceratops, Puertasaurus, Shantungosaurus, Anklyosaurus, Gallimimus, and Diabloceratops. Your main goal for now is to survive. When you start the game, your food and water will be around half, while your stamina is full.\n\nWhen I started the game, it took a little get used to manuevering my way around the map. Coordinates and landmarks are useful, when you have a certain destination to get to. The players in species chat, I find, can also be very helpful, when trying to find my way around in the game. At first, I played a Raptor, then dabbled a bit with Dryo... now my main dinosaur characters tend to be the Austroraptor and Allosaurus.\n\nWhen getting more involved with the game, I find that some players of other species play fairly, while others will either kill on site, or kill for the hell of it. It is just like any other survival game, where some players tend to be kind, while others like to troll and cause havoc on the servers. As long as player finds a good group of people to play with, a player should be able to survive pretty well in the game.\n\nNow, when playing the game, expect there to be some server crashes and restarts. They do tend to happen, and it does get frustrating at times. Some days are worse than other days, but playing the game, I find it worth it to deal with the crashes. After all, this game is still in development, so it is nothing unheard of.\n\nWould I recommend the game in its current state? Well, if you want to experience surviving as a dinosaur, and don't mind the crashing, then yes. This game can be very fun to play, especially with a group of people. If you want to wait until the game is further developed, then that is fine too. I would recommend for a person (if they do not wish to spend the money for the game at this time), to at least have the game on their watch list. I have a good feeling about this game getting better, with progress from the developments, and there are new dinosaurs being added with the updates.","April 13","true","88.6"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","14","21","0","0"

Now considering that the game is still in very Early Access don't expect it to be bug free with loads of content. Now I won't delve too far into the gameplay so much as you can get that information in other reviews, I'm just giving my impressions of the game. Also, to you Mac/Linux players out there, the dev team has not forsaken you (actually us, i play mac xD) Mac/Linux support has been added but still needs to be polished. If you want to play but don't want terrible fps/lag or bugs you may want to wait a few weeks. That being said, the game in its current bare-bones state is still very enjoyable.\n\nPros\n-I'M A FERKIN DINOSAUR!!!!!\n-Many different species of dinos\n-Realistic dinosaur textures as well as animations\n-Many different species to play from the mighty Puetasaurus to the timid Dryosaurus\n-Intense battles and fights mixed in with calm migrations\n-Basic survival needs such as food and water\n-Large maps (Players are spread out)\n-A small and close knit community. You will often play with players more than once which is nice (Its not a "Oh that guy was fun to play with, I'll never see him again" kinda thing.\n-Mac/Linux support (Cause we matter too)\n\nCons\n-A few bugs, glitches and spots in the maps where a player can get stuck\n-Large maps (Takes a LOOOONNGGGG time to get to places)\n-Things like Kill On Sight (KOS) and carebearing (carnivores hanging with hebivores)\n-Lag and Low frames (I average about 6-12 fps)\n-The devs can be pretty rude, swear a lot and use slurs (I think it's a little funny but you may not) While this might not be everybodys thing that stuff is maily kept on the devolopment streams.\n\nIn conlusion, The Isle is one of the best dinosaure games I've played and seen. In the past four days I've logged 16 hours and plan to play many many more in the weeks to come. I've had instances of deep imersion in the game where I felt I was a hunted shantu or a sneaky Carno stalking my prey.\nOverall, I'd give the game a 7/10. Why the C+? The game has many bugs and missing content. There is occasionaly brief spurts of drama within the dev team. However, the game has loads of potential.

Heck, it currently feels a lot like playing a dinosaur life simulator(just without breeding and diseases). Sure it's lacking a bit of the end game content, but the devs did a great job with what they have now for us.\nAll the dinos are enjoyable to play, especially the herbivores. The rush of running with your gallimimus flock through the island, using the herding instinct to outwit raptors and rexes, the teamwork of shangtungs to ward off a pack of carnos, it's all awesome. When I first bought this game I expected a trex blood bath all over the island, but instead I find myself playing gallimimus the whole time and witnessed players herding as herbivores more than killing as carnivores. Also,in the long run, learning about these carnivores and how they hunted may help a new player to this game. I've seen only a couple of carnivore players actually ambush.\n\nBut anyway, though you'd need a good graphics card to play lag free, it's moderately optimized for its first release. The enviroment is extremely beautiful, I always gotta squint at the sunsets because it tricks my eyes into believing it's real. The island is very much big enough for a server of 100. I've been on a server of 60 and only ran into a few players (some not so friendly)\n\nThis game only needs to fix a couple of bugs, do something about raptors infintely clinging, upgrade the AI, and optimize, then I'm down with whatever the devs dish out for us in the future.\n\nI can see this game going places. I always saw Stomping Land as my all time favorite Early Access game, but this replaces it for me","December 3, 2015","true","172.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The movement feels real and weighty, even to the point that I begin to think I may actually be a dino myself (only a slight exaggeration).  The raptors are fast and sneaky, the Trex are stompy and strong, the Triceratops runs like a boss and eats trees in one mighty bite!  I can hardly explain how great it feels when you pounce on a Trex and shred them apart as a raptor before running to cover.\n\nThe devs make improvements several times a week and the dinosaurs are releasing faster than I could have ever hoped.  I recommend this game on my YouTube channel all the time and plan to cover it for a long time to come.  It feels real solid and is already a very fun game considering how much futher they plan to take it.

The maps are huge and unless you've spent a ton of time in them you won't really know what to do or where to go. Even on a full server with 60 people you'll be hard-pressed to actually run into any other people/dinosaurs.\nWhat this game needs is prey. It's fun to be a dinosaur and try to kill other dinosaurs. If you're a long-neck, killing just about anything becomes yay easier, and it should be that way, there's a distinct advantage these animals had back in the day to compensate for their enormous size. BUT, to make this a game and not just a dinosaur walking simulator, the maps should be filled with various NPCs to eat/hunt down.\nAll that said, the devs are updating the game pretty much every day, which does make a difference and shows great promise for the future of this title.","April 7","true","4.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

As of right now, the features are limited and there is still a lot of refinement to be done, but it is in early Alpha, so that is to be expected.

I'm going to do my best to keep my personal preferences from coloring my review and focus strictly on my observations and best hypotheses from a businessperson's point of view.\n\nI'll include the caveat that I still enjoy playing this game from time to time, and in earlier iterations I absolutely loved it.  However, after learning more about the game, interacting with the community and seeing some of the developmental decisions being made, I have to safely say that I no longer recommend this game.  Here's why.\n\nFirst, the development team.  While some of them are professional, I've found that this isn't the case for all of them.  I haven't had poor interactions with them personally, but I've seen them first-hand openly attack players for asking simple, reasonable questions, and they are generally rude.  They also appear to be unwilling to listen to suggestions from the community.  Unfortunately, this doesn't bode well for the future of the game, as this will negatively affect consumers' view.\n\nSecond is the fact that the public branch of the game is now the test version.  While I agree that this is a great way to obtain raw data for future improvements, I have a feeling it's going to turn away a large quantity of new players and veteran players alike.  The version out now is just too unstable and unbalanced to be enjoyable anymore.  Whereas I used to play hours each day, I maybe log in once a day or not at all - it's simply too frustrating and you are essentially forced into playing only about three dinosaurs of the choices that are available. Yes, I am aware that this is an Early Access game and bugs of all shapes and sizes are expected, but the game is almost downright unplayable (i.e. herbivores can't even eat on the most common map, and therefore can't heal or slowly starve to death) - I find the "Early Access" argument to not have much teeth in this case.\n\nThird is the direction the game is heading.  Yes, it's essentially a super-hardcore survival game with only a small core audience in mind - that's what the developers want to do, which is their right.  But I have a very hard time seeing the long-term financial viability of this game with what they have in mind.  I understand they want to cater to only the hardest of the hardcore, but ultimately, the end product stands to be too complex and difficult for most people to want to play.  My prediction is that it will not be profitable.\n\nThese are just my two cents.  While it is a beautiful game with a lot of potential, my outlook for this game is rather bleak based on its current state.","March 27","false","304.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Although, for the most part, the Developer plans on adding a few commonly known dinosaurs, already you can tell from the currnet dinosaurs that there is a focus on the lesser known ones. Great game for the casual gamer and the dinosaur lover alike.","December 14, 2015","true","54.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

I saw minor bits of gameplay and decided to try it out. Im basing this review around a couple of key factors that as a game designer, I believe are some of the more important aspects to what makes a game good or bad. Models, audio, environment, gameplay mechanics and stability. Because this game is still in early access, many of this may change, this review is more to inform on if it is worth your $20 or not.\n\nWe will start with environment:\nIt has a good balance of open fields and forests. It allows for good ambush play, open field battles, large herd migrations and an overall natural feel for the game. The island is massive and one can easily get lost which I love and hate at the same time. It actually makes you nervous. The actual models and textures are ok. It could benefit some better diversity in plant life. Again it is a early access build, keep that in mind. I also understand the keeping the environment tame while testing and building as it can kill a game if it goes overboard too fast. so for environment: 6/10\n\nAudio:\nThis is one of my favorite parts. The audio sounds like they hired the audio team from the Jurassic park movies as the cries are incredible. The audio location is fantastic and something I hope they continue to perfect. Hearing a sound to a side of you, thats where it is. It is incredibly well done. Each dinosaur has multiple cries for varied situations, hostile, peaceful, regular, cries for help, its fantastic. For audio: 9/10\n\nModels:\nFirst off, lets get past the realistic and accuracy part of things. Yes these dinos arnt as feathery as they should be, but that is an extremely easy fix. I still really love these models. I am a huge fan of the Jurassic park movies, the Walking with Dinosaurs series and so on, and these models are so accurate(minus the feathers on some), detailed and beautiful. My all time favorite thus far is the Allosaur. The one skin looks as tho it was pulled straight from the second episode of Walking with Dinosaurs and I love it!!! I strongly believe that the quality for the models will continue to go this strong for future dinos and Im extremely happy about that. I would love to see alternate skins for each so people can choose the feather or non feather version. Would add even more fun. Models: 8/10\n\nMechanics:\nIt plays good. Slow dinosaurs feel slow, fast dinosaur feel fast. The controls are easy to pick up and master in no time. The attack animations and eating could have a little more feeling to them but once again easy fix and most likely will get polished as time goes on. It could do with just some more polishing and to make some of the movements smoother and a little less jerky, but its on a track! Mechanics: 7/10\n\n\nStability:\nThis one is the only big gripe I have thus far. Server crashes. Its rough and some days can be infuriating. And other times there are no crashes for hours. There are still bugs that pop up, clipping through the world with the camera, and some silliness with disappearing dinosaurs. I hope the devs are listening to the community and I believe they are as they are constantly updating and refining. Frame rate has been good. I have had a very consistent frame rate while playing and it doesnt just drop fro no apparent reason.  These are all temporary so keep that in mind. So if you run into any shenanigans, please inform the devs so we can attempt and make this game as fantastic as it can become! Stability: 4/10\n\nFinal thoughts:\nI cannot wait for what this game will become! It plays well, its fun and just awesome to play as some of your favorite dinosaurs. I am really hoping they add plenty more species and types of dinos! I cant wait to see and play as my all time favorite, the Parasaurolophus!!! My biggest fear is with the addition of humans as I am afraid humans might be extremely over powered and I hope the devs find a really good balance, which with how they have balanced the dinos thus far, seems that they will find a sweet spot. Overall it is a great game! A must own and support if you are a fan of dinos like I am. Get a friend too and for your little Allo pack for hunting.\n\nI highly recommend this game.\n\n\n","May 29","true","18.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

At least, in its current state. Please keep reading before buying.\n\n8/10. This is a great survival game. And it has dinosaurs!\n\n\nThis game offers three carnivore species and three herbivore species to play, and some truly massive maps. Admittedly, there are bugs, but for the most part it's very well-put together for an early access game. Aside from the currently defenseless and slow sauropod species, it seems people are opting to play as all five other species in roughly even numbers, which I haven't seen in other survival games that offer this option. (One example is the obscure Lif series of two games, which are a terribly broken mess of rampant killing.) The models were purchased from failed Ark: Survival Evolved ancenstor, The Stomping Land, and they look brilliant. Absolutely brilliant! The skins are also great, but don't take my word for it. Look at the screenshots!\n\nMy only concern for this game is its future. Just read what the devs plan to add. Humans? Crafting? Dinosaur catching/taming? Brutal difficulty? Yeah, there's a reason I mentioned Ark: Survival Evolved earlier. No thank you, developers! You're talented people to have put out what you have already, but this is a niche of games already well-populated! Meanwhile you've already drawn much praise for what you have out right now. Perhaps your skills are best suited to The Isle, not Primal Carnage or Ark: Survival Evolved.","December 7, 2015","true","112.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheVintageOne/recommended/376210/","TheVintageOne","Zatubo5","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheVintageOne/","52 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe Isle. Ah, what can i say about the isle?\n\n\nThe Isle is an extremely early access game, which seems to be pretty obvious, due to it being plastered on the front of it. Playing as a dinosaur is admittedly very fun, and i feel like many people overrate the game due to that fact. So i will be rather harsh on it in my review:\n\nThe game has absolutely ZERO content. While i can say that it's fun for a dinosaur lover like myself, as an open world dinosaur game has been one of my largest dreams, (didn't much like the primal carnage jist of things) for a non dinosaur game lover, this game could be severely dissapointing. It has six dinosaur classes. There are a few notable ones that stand out to me.\n\n\nAt the moment, T-rex is the most disturbingly powerful, and can kill pretty much anything. Any more than a pair of t-rexes is just outright unfair. If this game has any hope of being balanced, the nerf hammer will surely strike t-rex.\n\n\nIn the current stage of the game, Gallimimus is decently in the overpowered realm. It has nigh infinite sprint, making walking a passtime, since it can run for pretty much ever. It is an herbivore, which means it can eat plants and drink water, making it able to sustain itself without putting itself in harms way. With the ability to outrun ANY ingame creature, and the ability to sustain itself without ever coming into contact with a predator, it is very easy to play. Its only downside is that it has the least health of anything in the game, but that doesn't matter when nothing can catch you.\n\n\nShantungosaurus falls into the realm of underpower, in my opinion. A few classes, T-rex and Carnotaurus (I will speak of carnotaurus later) can easily dispatch a single Shantungosaurus without much of a difficulty, however, the latter of the two might have a challenge if they aren't experienced. It is a large herbivore that looks similar to an Iguanodon. As of right now, it has zero defence from a T-rex, as it is slower and less physically capable of dealing with one than vice versa. The only way to defend itself is a herd, but seeing as T-rex is often a more popular dinosaur, (Which ironically usually leads to there being more carnivores than herbivores) It will often be outnumbered anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\nCarnotaurus, for one, falls into the balanced realm, in my opinion. It is a capable fighter, yet cannot deal with herds of herbivores, even if it has a pack itself. (Unless the herbivores are extremely outnumbered) This, i feel, is how all carnivores should be, just in different segments of the food chain. It can kill the herbivore classes if they are alone, and, even a lone T-rex if the Carnotaurus is sufficiently skilled.\n\n\nAustroraptor may fall into neutral or overpowered realms after it receives its pounce back, but as of the current state, you'd be better off playing as a puddle of water. Before, it required its pounce to do pretty much any amount of damage to anything other than other Raptors and Gallimimus. Now, with its pounce currently in the process of being fixed, i cannot see anyone sane playing it and expecting to have a fair chance. For now, this class is SEVERELY underpowered, and beyond functionality.\n\n\nPeurtasaurus falls into the realm of SEVERELY UNDERPOWERED. It can do NO damage, and although it has ALOT of health, it is very SLOW. It is what some people may refer to as Longnecks, (this makes me very angry, as i am a dinonerd) And what more seasoned players refer to as Peurtasaurus, its' proper name. Right now, as it can do no damage, it is a matter of time before you succumb to an angry T-rex. I hear it is getting fixed, and as little as less than 24 hours after this review goes up, however. Perhaps when it is fixed again, it may be a balanced class.\n\n\nThe Isle is probably wonderful upon first inspection, but it quickly becomes BORING, TEDIOUS, and a CHORE, if you find yourself in the wrong server at the wrong time, just trying to have fun. The game could be much better. but, it is surprisingly sufficient for EARLY ALPHA ACCESS. Don't buy it if you're not a dino nerd.

It's a simple yet unique concept that should have been used LONG ago, but never was. Ever since I was little I loved dinosaurs, and wished for a game like this. Finally, the game of my dreams is here. I can play as seven creatures without limitation. Most animal simulating games require you to reach a certain level or have so many kills, or points, to advance to the next creature. Here I can be whichever creature I want. The graphics are amazing. The textures, the way the sun hits the ground, everything besides the water, which you can walk under. Beware the water, a T-Rex jumped out of it and attacked me once! This game is hardcore- there are no health bars, no hunger bars, no thirst. You can view your stamina and co-oords when you hit 'Insert', but that's all. An easy way to tell if your being attacked is if a dinosaur is chasing you and biting you or a little bit of blood appears on the screen. Once you die, a screen pops up announcing that your dead. This scared me at first, so make sure you're prepared. This is also a multiplayer game, and the comunnity is fantastic and kind. I would suggest finding a herd as soon as possible and watch out for carnos- once they spot you, there's no escape unless their stamina runs low. It would be nice if a scent button were added, so you could find a herd, find prey, or find predators and hide. I would also like the NPCs to act a bit more lifelike. This game is awesome, don't hesitate to buy it!","January 4","true","55.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I couldn't have guessed how in depth this game was. And the kicker is it's so simple as of now.\n\nThere's no weapons or ammo or reloading or talking sh** to the other team. In fact, you can only chat with other people playing your same species. You can't hold grudges on other players because you usually can't identify them unless you're in a pack/herd.\n\nThe focus is all on survival. You have claws or spikes or teeth or size, but your best survival tool is the sounds you can make. There are 4 sounds, as well as the sounds of your attacks, that you can use to communicate and body gesture. It is very intuitive, you can understand people's intentions and what they mean even if you can't chat with them. You can threaten, call for help, roar over a great distance, and signal for peace. And it all is sewn seamlessly into a beautiful landscape and soundscape.\n\nThe devs are very active and in tune with the community, I hang out on their Discord they made for the public. There have several updates in the short time I've had this game. I've met a good bunch from the community.\n\nTL;DR spend the 20 bucks. it keeps getting better and it's hard f'n core","April 8","true","63.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

(I got this game on sale for $16.99, it's still not worth that in my own opinion, least not this early in development.)\n\nWhat you get from buying this game:\n\nPlay as a dinosuar, you have a few different types to choose from, like a T-Rex, a raptor-bird-thing, a Long Neck Mc.Stompsalot, a dinosuar that looks like Satan's pet, etc.\n\nTwo maps: Either a mesa area with many lakes everywhere or a jungle type map. (Both maps ar pretty bland with no real change in scenery no matter where you go around the map. Just... rocks n' crap.

They treat it's player base with a mentality of "It's my game, I'll do what I want, including banning random people for small offences".\nThe route they're going down is highly egotistical all the while mocking everyone who has an emotion, like it's a weakness to the human species. I feel nervous even writing this review because of the mentality they have, even I might get banned from playing for saying negative things about them, and that's not on.\nThey need to realise that making a game is a business, and dealing with stupid human beings is in the job description. Either do it right or ignore them. The fact that they openly respond in rude, unprofessional comments continues to show how weak their egos are, using insults and harsh language to hide their sensitivities. To quote Dondi from his stream, "Oh boo hoo, my feelings."\n\nGet this game if you want what might one day be a good dinosaur game, but don't go into it expecting a warm welcome.\n\n---\n\nOriginal Post:\n\nThere is potential here, certainly a prospect I can get very excited for should it come to completion.\nI can't really give a 'review' considering there isn't much yet to be able to review, and the fact people are already judging it on what there is so far is a little confusing to me. It could go either way, but as for the idea and the starting blocks already in place, they're both awesome. There's been no sign that things will go down hill, so I have no reason to believe such.","December 3, 2015","false","92.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","2"

That's normal; It's in Early Access. However, the key difference between The Isle and other such barebones Early Access titles is that The Isle manages to be entertaining in a quasi-fetal stage of development.\n\nIf you don't know what that means, let me make it clear. The Isle's foundation is SOLID, and while there's bugs needing some ironing out, as well as some polish to be made, it doesn't make me worry for the game's future.\n\nSo what is The Isle anyway? RIGHT NOW, it's a dinosaur survival game. No humans. Just Dinosaurs. On a massive Island. The island itself is a bit overwhelmingly large, actually, but hopping into a server which has over thirty players makes it feel like a real world. You won't encounter people constantly, and when you do, the decisions you make will make the difference between survival and death. You can't trust anyone openly, and so you must analyse visual cues, or send some yourself. I'm told the dinosaurs will eventually have different calls to communicate, but in the mean time, interpret carefully. Even your own species could turn on you, especially if you're competing for food.\n\nBut all species tend to be played similarly to one another, as if the players have an unspoken agreement; Rexes will be cautious, but might form alliances with one another, or fight for territory, or straight up avoid each other. Raptors rarely ever resort to cannibalism, often barking a few times as a greeting, and then group up to take down the larger prey. Carnotaurus are a bit wishy-washy, and are often seen travelling alone, respecting boundaries. The herbivores will flock up together for better chances of survival, forming intimidating herds.\n\nIt's a beautiful ecosystem.\n\nThere's a steady barrage of updates getting thrown at the game with comprehensive changelogs, and they contain concrete changes and fixes, no frivolous crap.\n\nIf The Isle can keep me entertained for hours in its current state, I cannot wait to see the other factions added in, and all of the features that are already being worked on.","December 5, 2015","true","100.3"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

Bearing in mind that this is in early development I would reccommend it but there are very serious issues with the servers. You WILL get repeatedly bounced out of the servers when they have an error no matter what, collision needs to be added as well, certain dinos have too much attack radius while others cant bite a sauropod right in front of them. Virtually impossible to get certain herbos to eat. Also freezes up alot. So seeing as its early access I do reccommend it as the premise is fun but needs alot to complete. Certain things that would make it more fun would be aloowing raptors to grapple on the back of prey they pounce on an accessible HUD display and more features focused around forming and maintaining pack dynamics.

This I can say is true. I like feeling that I AM a dinosaur trying to survive in the harsh kill or be killed world. It is definitly more fun if you have friends who will play along side you.\n\nI spoke to some people and they will be adding more content such as NPCs and soon after that an AI system. Which I was happy to hear because there's no way to actually eat (if you are a carnivor) if there's no food. Especially if you are in a server with no players.\n\nThe one thing I hope they can add in next to the NPCs is a single player mode. I love when games create modes where you can be online and offline. I feel that this game can have both those options. They definitly need some sort of maping system or maybe like a smell map where you sniff the air and it will tell you where food, water or other dinosaurs are. It is difficult to find my friends when playing after I died or logged in.\n\nI also hope they make it so Herbivours don't die so easily and have a bit more of a fighting chance just as Carnivors do. That way not everyone is choosing Carnivor because Herbivors are hard to play.\n\nOther than those difficulties, I see SO much potential in this game. It is beautifully created for being in early access. Just by seeing the quality now makes me believe there will be so much added to this game down the road. I hope when people buy this they do not quickly discard it. If you really love those type of simulations of survivle and living anothers life than this is a very amazing game.\n\nI can not began to describe how amazing it feels to run with a pack of T-Rexs or trample slowly across the valley with other Long Necks (I love Little Foot so I like to call them Long Necks, same with Sharp Tooths.

This game is still in alpha stages, after all. After I waited for a while, I finally caught up on everything. I then realized how great this game was, and I definitely recommend this to anyone with a love of survival games and dinosaurs. The developer's actively update, and have been giving new dinosaurs by what feels like every week. I can't promise that this will be your type of game if you enjoy violence and action 24/7, but enjoying the company of a nearby herd or allies. Long story short, This is a great game with bugs being fixed constantly, and new things being added frequently.

The game as it currently is will not be the game it will be later on in development as the devs are using it as a testing ground for various different things. It's more or less a playground at the moment. However it is still very enjoyable and there is still a survival feel to it as it is now.\n\nYou will die.\nIt happens. It could be a predator that gets you, it could be another of your species or "faction". This game isn't for those who take things personally and/or those who get upset when another person kills them, because it WILL happen. Not everyone is hugs and sunshine with others. On the other hand not everyone is a hyperviolent ♥♥♥♥ either and quite a few people are more than happy to trust and buddy up in multi-species groups. A lot of the judgement I'm seeing about the game are based on how the players play, not how the game itself functions. No the balancing isn't that great, but it's not meant to be. It's meant to be an ecosystem, not a game where you can pop onto a rex and slaughter things left and right. Mess with that giant puertasaurus and you'll die. Try to take on an entire herd on your own and you will die. The game isn't meant to be easy, and will only get harder as more content is made and released. That's the point of it. The devs want you on edge, mistrusting others, and wondering just how long you can make it before something gets you. It's meant to be thrilling, and I personally can't wait until it becomes that game.\n\nDon't take any of the reviews as the complete truth about the game. Each one is tainted with the posters own bias. Hell even this one is biased. Instead read a few positive ones, a few negative ones, and decide for yourself if this game seems like something you'd enjoy backing and playing in the future.\n\nRandom rant:\nInserting more of my own bias here, I wouldn't take any of the reviews that are solely about what happened between the devs to heart. It was a personal matter and they handled it the way they felt best. Things were said from both sides, not just one, and people need to learn that it's none of their business what happens between them. The game didn't shut down, progress is still being made, the only negative outcome was that we lost skins. A cosmetic item at most that ultimately doesn't prevent you from playing and enjoying the game. Something which will be making a return.\n\n\nTL;DR The game is still a big work in progress. It's still fairly new and barebones, but it's enjoyable and the devs are still working hard to make it the game they promised on the page above.","February 5","true","484.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

I think it's worth a updated review of some of the new content.\n\nThe game continues to be the Dino survival/sim it has always been up to this point! Other reviews will tell you what the games about if your new. Go read one of them then come back here to see what's new! :) Anyway thanks to some new mechanics and features this game is becoming really really really good!.\n\nCombat is now brutal, but fair thanks to the new addition of a bleed mechanic which causes you to lose health over time if you suffer damage. If you try and run away while bleeding you will suffer a huge constant health drain, you have to literally stop and rest if you wan't to minimise blood loss (As in real life). This creates panic moments when your bleeding out as to what to do next! Plus this makes small Dino's no pushover! (Thank god!) I used to laugh as a Carno when I saw a Raptor... Now im very on edge as I know it could easily take me down if I make a wrong move. The bleed mechanic is a great thing and adds realism to the game!\nThis is paired greatly with visual damage on your dino when you are injured! Huge cuts, claw marks, scars and the fact you do visually bleed if you have been bitten! All this will be shown! Again another nice thing to add to the realism and the immersion.. Also shows other Dino's that you are potential food!\n\nLong grass although been out for a while now aids small Dino's like the Austroraptor greatly for hunting and hiding. Same goes for Galli and Dryo players, bigger Dino's such as Rex while far stronger need to keep a close eye out when travelling through these areas! I have seen packs of Raptors bring down the biggest of predators through using long grass to ambush!\nFootprints have also been added! You can now literally follow a Dino's recent footstep trail! Great for when your on the hunt! Beware that goes for you too though :P\n\nThese are just some of the things that have been recently added. The game is showing more and more promise as it continues through it's development, but do note it still has bugs, crashes from time to time, mechanics which need a bit more polish, balance issues and sometimes the game might not work altogether for whatever reason! If you can deal with that pick it up now and support the game. If you can't, but your interested keep a close eye on it! It's worth it's weight and then some!","March 14","true","129.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Easy to find herds/packs and its fun to play with other people in a pack.\nThe game that you play right now is not the game they are making though. when they add new features that are a finale product it can change the whole game.

I got the game after watching some YouTube videos.  It looked very fun in those so I gave it a shot.  And it WAS fun for the first week or so, until they introduced a leg-breaking mechanic which makes you sit around for 2 minutes to 2.5 hours (depending how big your dino is) for your broken leg to heal, during which time you can only crawl and most other dinos will view you as dead, which you basically are.  I've waited to see if it was intended to be this bad and now I've seen dev confirmation that it is.\n\nI should have read the game description closer before buying and it's my fault for not doing so:\n\n"Over time, the game will be updated to the point of intended hardcore functionality. As this happens, difficulty will gradually become more brutal and chances of survival become less likely."\n\nI personally want more fun and less brutal in my games so I think this is where I get off.\n\nRegarding polish, the game feels like an alpha currently.  You can play and probably not crash often, but disconnects are a little frequent and almost no part of the UI is good (there's a bar for Stamina, Food, & Water, but not for your health--and you do die when you get to 0).  You spawn in a random location and basically need to get to one of the lakes because that's where the other people are, a journey that can take 1-20 minutes if nothing bad happens to you on the way (see: leg breaking).  Short of memorizing the map, the only way to get to known places is to keep your debug screen up, which puts distracting writing all over the screen, while you watch 2 extra long coordinates at the top and try to keep going in the proper direction.  The lakes are largely bursts of massacres but that's pretty much all you can do at the moment.  Some people try to roleplay but it's ultimately silly when others will just attack you anyway.  I was a triceratops and resting next to another one in a herd of herbivores.  Then he got up and just killed me out of the blue before I could react.  Sweet, see you guys in 20 :)\n\nI'll maybe re-assess at a later point but I wouldn't recommend it to my friends at the moment so I can't recommend it to anyone else.\n\nAnd yes, the lead dev (at least) is quite brash.  It's not my cup of tea but I know some people think it's great so YMMV.","April 17","false","63.3"," 37 of 70 people (53%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","53","37","70","6","13"

I'll try and keep it simple:\n\nPro's\n\nIt looks fantastic. The skins and general environment, including the soundscape, are entirely right for a game of this kind.\n\nIt runs really well (for me at least) I've played it for several hours and the only thing I found was the occasional drop out of the Xbox controller. I can't be sure this was the game and assume it wasn't.\n\nThe play area is huge and with a bit of experience you could really use the environment to your advantage, either for hiding or hunting. It's not just for show, it actually works.\n\nThere's plenty of choice in terms of what you play.\n\nThe character animations and actions are realistic.\n\nThe chat system works well without getting in the way.\n\nIt's highly configurable.\n\n\nCons\n\nWhilst the core game works, it isn't explained at all. Some of it is obvious, other parts less so. Figuring it out and setting things up while you're getting eaten alive can be tricky. If you want a soft landing do a bit of reading beforehand.\n\nThere's no map. Whilst this may add to the realism it does make gameplay frustrating at times. There is a system you can use tied to the dev options but it's not too user friendly.\n\nWhen you die (which you will) you're returned to a spawn point. I'm not 100% sure if this is the same one or if there's a few. Either way it can be some distance from where you were. You can see the sense in this as otherwise the dino attacking you could just rinse/repeat for XP but it's a bit frustrating. The trick is don't die.\n\nOverall despite the gripes it's a good game. Having watched the Devs stream on Twitch you can see it's got huge potential so it's worth it just for that.\n\n\n\n","February 19","true","78.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Bugs are also common, but it's in Alpha, so don't whine.\n\nIf you want support a game with more potential than most early-access games and its got a dedicated team behind it. If that intrigues you, then buy this game.\n\nOr don't.\n\nShoutout to Dondi! Great stream last night!

You basically run around as a Dino that's it. But I am giving it a positive review because patches and updates are frequent and I can see that soon this could be a great game it has much potential. And is a very unique idea. Really can't wait to see how this turns out.

It's extremely fun to play a dinosaur and spening  a few hours forming a make shift pack and hunting things down. I feel like one of the biggest downsides is the size of the map. You can log in and spend 20 minutes looking for someone and never spot a soul. This isnt that bad of a downside considering how fun it is to play this game.

There needs to be deathmatch servers where the people who come in and just kill everything on sight can get their fix and stop messing with the people actually trying to survive. Its hard to keep playing when one of your own herd and or pack same species just decides to stomp you.

VHS's of Walking With Dinosaurs ;)\n\nAnyway, I first started playing it I was scared ****less, I was a Carnotaurus, whomping around the forest, not knowing what I was doing. I was aware there are bigger things then me!\n\nFurther I went into the forest learning my way around, trying to find things to feed my hunger. After 10 minutes of crouch walking, I heard a large thud. I stopped and looked around, low and behold it was a Tyrannosaurus Rex. I feared for my life, I hid behind a ridge of rocks and waited for it to pass. I am to the point of no water and food, I am panicking.\n\nFinally at some point I see something in the distance, water, a large body of water! I went over their super cautious and began to drink. I noticed Herbivores eating and lumbering about, as the days go by of me playing this game I got to try out every single species and see pretty much every map and check out every inch of it.\n\nThis game is simply amazing, different and those negative comments are stupid. Oh you spent like less then an hour playing not seeing everything for what it is?\n\nYes this game does have a few bugs "Not many to cry about and quit"\n\nAs I have been playing the game keeps updating, we have a wide about of different dinosaurs!\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=569793941 That is a good place to look at each of them.\n\n\nThe community has quiet a few guides on how to play and such. I have never had so much fun playing a game in a while.\nThe dev team keeps us up to date, we do get updates, this game is not dead. Plus most the servers have like 80 or more people at a time.\n\nI myself have found a new server that I am in love with! Isle Le Sorna\n\nIt has rules, its fun, the community is friendly there, all the other servers have 0 rules and can end in things being a little unfair.\n\nLike a pack of rexes defending herbs, we call it carebearing. Or vise versa!\n\n\nAnyway, there will be even more updates, the dev team even has a discord channel to talk to you and put out updates, the negative reviews are a lie, the game is getting bigger and I will continue to play this game weekly.\n\n\nEven if you do not have friends that play it, its a good chance you will find some on here and start packs and roam and kill together. Do not judge a book by its cover because 5 people drew on the front and gave it a bad rep\n\n\nVorlon","March 7","true","213.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There are many dinosaurs to choose from with a great variety of skins, ranging from herbivores to carnivores; humans are claimed to be coming soon. All of these dinosaurs have unique traits (attacks, health points, call/roar and skin variation, etc.) and unique people who play as them. You can choose any dinosaur you want with no restrictions (at the moment), whether it be a helpless and small dryosaur to a fast and powerful shantungosaurus. You can form herds of your own species, plan secretly with species chat, or plot points in which you are interested to travel to. The community is great- with the average expectation of a few obnoxious players, even though the developers may not be the kindest of people.\nIf you’re looking for nice, helpful, and generous developers who strive to complete their goals for the benefits of their customers, stay clear from their live streams. The developers are nasty, cold-hearted, and ultimately insult and annoy their customers (not a very smart business decision). Only some (probably only one) developers are actually mature and normal people. Aside from all the potent drama- that could be the downfall of this game- here are some pros and cons of the game (do consider that this is an early access review):\nPROS:\n-Great variety of dinosaurs that are updated weekly.\n-Great gameplay when regarding an early access game.\n-Regular bug fixes.\n-Weekly updates.\n-Great simulation potential.\n-The ability to form herds and/or packs with other dinosaurs.\n-Species chat, which enables players to plot secretly when hunting, foraging, or travelling.\n-Various calls to signal others without use of chat.\n-Engaging wilderness.\n-Very positive community.\n-Suggested issues are usually addressed and resolved as soon as possible.\n-Large maps with great potential.\n-Lists of stats such as health and stamina.\n-Intense (though mostly calming) survival simulation.\n-Well-paced development.\n-Outstanding and smooth animation.\n-Great graphics for an early access game.\n\nCONS:\n-Developers who trash (insult) the community with horrible attitude.\n-Live streams filled with countless swears and slurs.\n-Large maps with no available tracking-maps (at the moment).\n-No ability to choose spawn-point areas (at the moment).\n-Lack of foliage (at the moment).\n-Unbalanced dinosaurs such as the Tyrannosaurus Rex (who has WAY too much health).\n-Powerful dinosaurs that were downgraded for no reason (shantungosaurus).\n-Uncomfortable and anticlimactic combat.\n-Occasional lag and poor game performance.\n-Large maps that prove to be a nettlesome task when traversing upon.\n-Trotting doesn’t really look like… Trotting…\n-Various glitches that can break the game or interrupt gameplay (as to be expected).\n-Not many underdog dinosaurs (tupandactylus, prionsuchus, suchomimus, pachycephalosaurus etc.).\n-This game does not have archaeopteryx. D:\n-Requires a beefy computer (not an issue for me, but may be for some without beefy PC’s).\n\nNOTE: Do not get this game with the intention that it well be never-ending fun, as it can get boring when there is a lack in content.\n\nEXTRA: COMMUNITY SUGGESTIONS\nI don't know if this will be any use to you [developers], but I traveled to random servers and asked random people about the dinosaurs they would most like to see. I'm thinking of conducting a poll later on, but for now, here are the results:\nTupandactylus (POPULAR), Pachycephalosaurus (REALLY POPULAR), Corythosaurus, Igunadon, Yutyrannus (POPULAR), Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus, Prionsuchus, Suchomimus (POPULAR), Ankylosaurus, Shunosaurus, Utahraptor, Rajasaurus, Pteranodon, Spinosaurus, Sarcosuchus, Giganotosaurus, Kaprosuchus, Archeopteryx (NOW POPULAR). That is all for now, I may conduct a poll later on.\n\nGAME RATING: 7/10 (This may change later on). [C+]\nNeeds work but has exceptional potential.\n-Iyan A\n","February 29","true","41.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I love the fact that you can only communicate with the same species in the chat. Though that doesn't mean you can't communicate with other species, you'll just have to use body language and sounds. Which is pretty awesome in my opinion.\nThe game is super fun as it is so far, fighting over territory among dinos, hunt, eat and survive. But I'm also very excited to see this game progressing into a finished game. I hope it will live up to our expectations even as new content is being added.","February 23","true","153.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However the game has been taking some pretty annoying downfalls. The idea of all the issues is understandable, raptors being fast, ect. Yet somehow with the larger map, and decreased stamina it has made the game literally unplayable. It takes hours to find another player on the map, and finding food and water is near impossible since it takes forever to get anywhere. The least you could do is give us a spawn point nearby one of the active lakes. Starting out starving and thirsty makes this an even larger feat, because by the time you reach water or food, you're already pretty much dead and someone kills you with one hit.\n\nI'm overall impressed with the amount of updating and fast fixes, but the game just isn't there yet. Flowing rivers, and intelligent npcs might make the task of playing less tedius, while keeping the game just as difficult as the developers want it to be. We understand you want the map to be large, and the game to be challenging, but there's a point where it goes from challenging to just plain boring from waiting forever. Personally I think stationary spawn points for each species near a general spot would be an excellent fix without having to change anything. The dinosaurs are down perfect, but everything else isn't.\n\nSo as it stands for now, my review remains negative.\n\nUPDATE EDIT: Art theft? Really guys? Talk about a poor dev leader, hopefully you feel ashamed of that, not to mention that now we have no skins to change into. I'm kind of mad at myself for buying the game now that I cant get a refund, I don't want to support an abusive dev. If you continue this way, the game isn't going to get finished. Suggest the others wait until there's a finished product befoe you buy this, because I'm certain things will go downhill from here.\n\nUPDATE EDIT: Nice! I was finally able to play it, took awhile for me to update my review so my apologies about that. I like the dinosaurs and their skins, very beautiful! However the enviroment could use a lot of work for a new age game. I myself and perfectly content with the way it is now, but I know people who are to hard on graphics so if that's something you really care about then this game probably isn't for you.\n\nYou aren't able to play as humans or cannibals yet, but I don't really care to be honest. I'm curious as to how that updates in the future, and how they play seperately. Something that annoys me is the chat option, there should be both a species chat, and a public chat. Not being able to communicate with all players can be difficult and causes a lot of confusion, especially if you are the only one playing as that species.\n\nI really enjoy the way the game plays so far, and was extremely excited to hear that isn't even all the dinosaurs they will be adding. Personally I would like to see an accurate representation of Dilophosaurus for once (sick of seeing the ridiculous Jurassic park version, it's pathetic), so I hope that will be a thing if they do add it. Otherwise other dinosaurs which would be interesting to see if they add them are Leaellynasaura, Ankylosaurus, Triceratops, Giganotosaurus, Microraptor, and Spinosaurus.\n\nOne thing that annoyed me though, and still does, is the unfair balancing of some dinosaurs. The raptor class is way too fast, and can kill any slower moving dinosaur without a scratch just by being behind their attacks, even the T-rex and other towering beasts. There literally was no possible way for me to get to them, and some would kill people for no reason at all and wouldn't give it up. The power of some of the dinosaurs seems strangely nerfed compared to others, and are pointless to be whatsoever. Understanding this is early access though, I can safely believe this will be fixed in the future.\n\nOverall it's a wonderful game, and worth my purchase so far.\n\n\nFIRST REVIEW: I understand this is pre-alpha, but I have the requirements and cannot open the game. It first loaded up, showed the screen, so I wanted to change the settings. As soon as I did that it keeps crashing, even after I restart it, it crashes. Hopefully this will be noticed and patched. I would love to try the game. Depending on th situation, I'd wait until later to jump in :)","January 10","false","21.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

So many dino fans were hyped for a little game called The Stomping Land many moons ago. Needless to say, it didn't last, with an unfinished mess of a game being left, along with the beautiful models they made for the dinos. Skip to 2015 and a demo for a game called The Isle was released. In the month of December this game was released into early access.\n\nSo far the game plays perfectly fine, with the player picking from a dinosaur of either the herbivore or carnivore side, with flyers and aquatics sooner or later showing up. Do I recommend this game for Dino fans? Hell yes. But keep in mind, it is early access, so many things are subject to change, such as the ability to be any dino/reptile you want from the start. That being said, if you do happen to be community friendly then beware of The Isle, as it's mostly full of people crying over the Devs releasing a certain animal *Looking at you Quetz 'fans'* or just whinning in general. So other than that, there isn't much to be bothered about, other than the odd bug or two in say the terrain. So, what are you waiting for reading this random review? Go buy it and throw your money to the Devs and buy this game, and throw some tips to Levia for more smexy skins.","April 4","true","55.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There are so many pros to it, I'll just list a few of the cons I see with it.\nMaps. They are HUGE and the coords are very confusing.\nThe ability to choose a spawn point, or CREATE one---such as with a nest or a den of some sort acting a respawn after you die. That way it doesn't take packs/herds 30 minutes to regroup after being killed. ITs extremely frustrating, especially for new players that don't know the maps.\n\nT-rex's are super OP right now, meanwhile, the Peurtas---who are so huge they should do massive damage---don't do anything. As a raptor, I could sit there and whittle away at their health, eventually killing one and it could smack me around and did almost nothing to me.\n\nPACK DYMANICS: There are none. You friendly fire and kill herd/pack mates all too easily. It would be wonderful if you could bring someone into your herd/pack and they become non-attackable, and viceversa.\n\nBring back the raptor's pouncing!\n\nThe ability to back up rather than turn around, that way we don't fall off a cliff when we get too close by accident.\n\nEating is a pain in the butt, super finicky. I have to either be directly on top of a plant, inside of the meat-bag I want to nom or nibbling at its nose in order to grab it.\n\nThe galli's sounds need to be fixed. Bigger rex roars! BIGGER!\n\nAdd a flying dino into the game---I'd kill to be a pteranadon, even if you never added another dino ever again.\n\nTo sum it up, the biggest problem is that map---too much map, too hard to find players or even npc dinos. Its pretty ridiculous.\nOtherwise, i cannot wait to see what you guys do with the game!","December 14, 2015","true","59.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Everybody loves dinosaurs and it isn't hard to imagine why I agreed to download The Isle. Entering the game, I was a skeptic. After a few hours logged in as a carno (using nothing but body language and the roars) my interest was peaked. This is what I would consider a sleeper in its infantile stage but is totally worth checking out.

Dondi´s vision of hardcore survival game as it is implemented now in the isle (april 2016) is rewarding for those who sit by the lake and take selfies instead of doing stuff with other people in world (taking selfies with other people does not count). Why?:\n\n- HEALING TAKES AGES. For some dinos it means 50HP per tick which is every 2 minutes. Most dinos hit you for more than 100HP. If your dino has more than 1000HP and you loose more than 50% of health, it is more effective to just suicide because you can run to same place with full health faster than if you healed as it was intended.\n\n- it takes at least 15 minutes to heal broken leg, in order to heal broken limb you have to sit still and do nothing because if you don´t, it will take 30 minutes to heal. Once again, suicide is faster. Even if you get worst spawn ever, you will be there faster)\n\nYou can stare at picture of a dinosaur of your choice for 30 minutes for free, higher fps and multiplatform compatibility guaranteed.\n\n2.

Here's how a typical session works. Boot the game, join a server and select your killing machine of choice. Proceed to run around completely lost unless you use the debug console for about 20-30 minutes(not exaggerating at all here unfortunately) before encountering another player, the server then crashes and forces you to reload the game as in most cases after a server crash your client will not load into another game until it has been restarted. Why? you ask? Well when joining a game after a server crash your client will immediately crash upon loading into the new server. After reloading the game and rejoining the server you get to hope that the server saved where you were or else you'll be loaded back to a spawn point. Upon finally finding another player its a 50-50 chance that they will kill you on sight thus starting the cycle over again. There are a few MAJOR flaws that make this alpha unplayable and it's not the technical issues listed.\n\nWhy is it unplayable?\n\n1. Broken legs. The smallest drop will cause you to break your leg which reduces your already snails pace movement speed to even slower molasses-like speed. I have heard that they can heal in time but i've not been able to reproduce the effect even after waiting for 10-15 minutes in rest mode. At which point you could have simply respawned and walked back to the place you were when you had your unfortunate incident. Which brings me to my next point.\n\n2. Respawning. It's not actually the respawning mechanic that is the issue here, it's getting to that mechanic that presents the problem. A sensible person would implement a feature that allows you to respawn in a timely fashion as to avoid issues like getting stuck, falling through the world, wanting to respawn and see other locations etc etc. I'm happy to report that this is indeed possible however there is one major problem with this mechanic. You can only do it 15 minutes after spawning or logging into a server, which ever was most recent. You can kiss your social life and even dinner goodbye if you want to respawn. The developers excuse for having this feature on such a lengthy timer is that the extra bodies produced by respawning cause server instability. This however is complete BS as any even half competent fool knows that the developer could simply add code to delete the illegitimate frustration baby produced by offing yourself when respawning. This leads to long, slow, frustraiting and unfun skifs of gameplay where you're simply limping around with your broken ♥♥♥ legs trying to find the nearest cliff to end your suffering. I could go on and on about how terrible this is and why it's really bad in an alpha to restrict the feature but I digress.\n\n3. Stamina. So all of the playable dinosaurs in the game have a stamina pool, this governs actions like sprinting and jumping and some attacks. This pool is 1k points for most characters, some higher. This pool regenerates naturally at about 1 point every 2-3 seconds which on it's own sounds horrible but it's really not that bad as you can simply rest to regenerate stamina. I assume this is designed this way so when you're fighting other players you cant simply run away from losing fights by running in a straight line to oblivion leaving your aggressor helpless to do anything except watch his delicious dinner slowly run away. The issue is that this pool of stamina regenerates at about 10  points per second when resting. This means if you want to cover any meaningful amount of distance you're going to have to run for about 1 minute, rest for 3 and run for a minute and so on and so forth. This leads to long long waits to get to any given point on the map, we're talking 10-20 minute "run backs" after death in most cases. Anyone who played early WoW understands the pains of long run backs, now imagine that world without flight points and mounts you can only use for 1 minute. Yeah.... its bad....\n\nIn summary these three major pain points lead to a slow, frustraiting, and unfulfilling experience. I understand that this game is still in alpha and has some major distance to cover but, that is no excuse for these issues as they are DESIGN choices. These problems could be remedied in a matter of hours if not minutes if the developer so chose to do so. I don't expect that these issues will be fixed or even looked at as issues thus leading to the early death of this title as the developer seems to be focused on introducing new content(theres already plenty to have a solid experience) rather that ensuring that the game is actually fun to play.\n\nIt could be argued that it is still very early in development and that the dev is simply following a bucket list of items to complete as to ensure a timely release but with the direction that development is headed and the lack of attention to bug fixes, it starting to paint a grim future for this title which is sad because there is a ton of potential in this idea but like planetside 2, the bugs, quality of life issues, and lack of insight into the reasons that games sometimes fail will cause this title to slowly fade away into abandonment or simply sputtering out. It's not too late at this point so I'll be checking in periodically to make sure this review stays fair.\n\n\nAll that being said, I (sadly)CANNOT recommend this alpha title for purchase even for those who simply "want to check it out".","June 3","false","15.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

This game feels REAL. The point is to survive, however, there will soon be a progression system in place which they are already beginning to implement, so essentially you will start out small and choose from lower end dinos/humans and fight to survive, earn points, and work your way up the food chain. This isnt a building/hoarding sim, its raw survival. If you are looking for a building sim with dinos go buy ark, if you want realistic prehistoric survival simulation you have come to the right game. I have already put over 100 hours into this game in its infant stages, money well spent as is.\n\nAnother good thing is that the developers are constantly putting out meaningful, and well done updates to improve gameplay. The game came out early december, and it has already become unrecognizable from the game i first purchased, so this so far is definitely not a repeat of TSL at all, and is way farther in development than TSL ever was.

I personally would put mine at 10% density, which was just fine for camouflage and much less laggy.\n\nInstead of fixing the badly optimized grass, they removed the ability to change it entirely, making literally HUNDREDS of players unable to play the game. Servers that once held 50-100 players all the time are now empty.\n\nGood job, idiots. If you don't have the reccomended specs, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It may look fun for someone who loves dinosaurs, but it will be a waste of money if you are under the reccomended specs.

Problems with the community aside there just isn't enough game here to warrant even a discounted price. You spawn in, and see what your dinosaur is like (at the time of writing this one of them doesn't even have any sound) and proceed through a prehistoric landscape to find some other dinosaurs to interact with. Except there aren't. The game has no npcs, most servers have a limit of 75 people or less, and the map is ridiculously huge. Topping that off with an inability to choose a spawnpoint can mean that you end up wandering an empty wasteland for almost 2 hours without finding anyone to interact with, any food to eat, or water to drink.

Nearly every (playable) dinosaur game pits you against people with guns. Ironically, this one is no different- but the focus is entirely on survival.\n\nThere are currently 13 dinosaurs (NO humans yet), and the models are very high quality. You spawn into the island half-hungry & thirsty. The maps are very WIP, but can still be nice to look at.\n\nCombat, unfortunately, is very underwhelming at the moment. The lack of an S/backpedal key makes it very easy to expose your backside to attackers. Despite the lack of a scent trail system (yet), hunting & stalking prey can be very exciting.\n\nOfficial servers are bit a dodgy, but the community makes up for this with group-based 'realism' servers of their own.\n\nThe final release will have civilized & uncivilized humans as well as mutated genetic experiments- both human and dinosaur. Like ARK:SE, you will be able to tame dinosaurs. Unlike ARK, this does not mean assimilation through narcotics. Player dinos will be tameable and can kill their trainer at any time.\n\nThere are plans to lock bigger dinosaurs behind a progression system, with enough stat upgrades to make you reconsider going straight for the bigger dinosaurs. The game is also going to slowly become hardcore survival- making you drop down a dino-tier when you die OR reseting your progress (depending on if you have a respawn-nest built). There will be different gamemodes (e.g. dino only, free roam, etc.).\n\n\n\nTo whom it may concern:\n\nDespite everything about this game being AAA, the developers don't take very many strides in being professional. They DO have concise information on development and update this 'round the clock; this feels more like a group of friends coming together to make something (beautiful) happen, rather than a studio getting paid to focus exclusively on the project.\nThey're a bit brazen when it comes to dealing with unwarranted flak and the project leader won't hesitate to be facetious.\nThe developers have adopted a line of thinking that prevents the community from being abusive and walking all over them- that's it. They don't act mean for the sake of being mean- 9 times out of 10 they're dealing with a very vocal minority.\nI want to see this game through till its release, the devs have a plan in mind and are sticking to it.","March 20","true","116.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't recommend watching the live streams, the mods on that can be a little unproffesional and it makes you regret supporting them by purchasing the game. Their behaviour definitely limits the amount of donations they would get. That being said, it in no way impacts the enjoyment received from the game.\n\nDefinitely recoomend the game, don't recommend the live streams.","February 21","true","27.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is extremely rare to find a game where you can actually play as the dinosaur, rather than a human taming or killing the dinosaurs. As it's designed to be open world there is a whole heap of space to explore. Having said that, they are still figuring out the game mechanics, so no mini map to help you find water, you have to rely on the overlay screen coordinates. I am also hoping that there will be non player dino spawns added as well, because at the moment, if playing as a carnivore you need to be able to seek out other players to satiate your hunger and there are only limited numbers of players in each server at one time - if you are the only one in the server you are likely to start starving.","February 14","true","4.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Ok you can call it whatever you want but what it's about is you play as an animal in the forest like a wolf and deer to small foxes and mice. It's just like the Isle but based in a forest with animals like today and yes wild dogs and CATS-my fellow warrior cat buddies will also be in the game. I think there should be LOADS of fur colors or scale colors and feathers, etc... Lastly I think you should be able to join packs or clans etc.. With invites or something like that. So ya thats pretty much a game that I would love to see and honestly I think it would be pretty popular. You the developers can obviously add more I was just summarizing most of it.","February 26","true","108.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The maps are huge, which can be good but there's no map, so a lot of your time can be spent by yourself potentially wondering in circles.  Character checks and balances needs more tweaking; Rex's just get destroyed by everything, blind spots due to turning radiuses are easily exploited, and it seems like herbivores can end up dominating the games sometimes and are way over powered.

Ive try many things that haven't worked.Also if you are a creater or just someone who creates/works with Theisles PLEASE fix this glitch! It would mean the world for me!!\nWalk:W\nRun:W and left shift\nBite/Attack:Click dat mouse or for me pad thingy XD idk wut to call it\n\nI also hope to see more maps and..no offense but ALOT better maps :O the maps now are quite small and boring.Also PLEASE!!!!! Don't add in humans ;-; i feel it would ruin the whole "simulator" feeling.It might be good BUT PLEASE!!!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE NO GUNS!!! That would totally ruin the simulator feeling.I hope they soon add in air dinos FOR SURE.Idk about water dinos.If u add in water dines u half to create a pretty beach and pretty ocean with a reaf and caves and stuff.One thing i really can't wait for is a map.Well actually idk? I kinda like the simulated feeling so idk really?? AND..last thing i promise i really hope they make the maps "more" simulator like because most of the maps are just like todays forest.I would like them to add in ALOT more trees and PLEASE add in ferns and basically more bushes..FERNS PLZ ADD IN FERNS!!!.....So yeah this game is really noice..ONE MORE THING!!!

My computer doesn't support the higher quality textures or anything like that but I don't need that. It's great with low quality. There's a different range of people, young to older. The oldest I've met on there was 27, and the youngest, not sure but from records, 13. Though they're not all that bad, focusing on the game or just simply making friends with each other. I've made plenty of friends/allies in the past few days while playing this game. I'm sure that once it's complete it will be a big hit, though I'm not too sure how these others might feel. The Isle is introducing humans to the game some time, right? And there's also a wide-range variety of dinosaurs, right? Well see, some people might see this game as a copy of Ark: Survival Evolved. Though it really isn't because you can play as dinosaurs without a mod and it's much more simpler.

The Isle has come such a long way from where it has started already, and even when I first bought the game I was extremely happy with how it was turning out.\nThe devs do a great job of keeping the community informed and updated on what is going on with the game.  I want to thank the Devs for all there hard work on The Isle, I feel like they don't get appropriated enough sometimes. They do spend a lot of there time working and developing the game, so I ask you to please be respectful.\n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend this game. It does need a GOOD computer to play, however. So be careful about that.  -Taylor.","March 23","true","196.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

My computer doesn't support the higher quality textures or anything like that but I don't need that. It's great with low quality. There's a different range of people, young to older.

I've made plenty of friends/allies in the past few days while playing this game. I'm sure that once it's complete it will be a big hit, though I'm not too sure how these others might feel. The Isle is introducing humans to the game some time, right? And there's also a wide-range variety of dinosaurs, right? Well see, some people might see this game as a copy of Ark: Survival Evolved.

It is extremely rare to find a game where you can actually play as the dinosaur, rather than a human taming or killing the dinosaurs. As it's designed to be open world there is a whole heap of space to explore. Having said that, they are still figuring out the game mechanics, so no mini map to help you find water, you have to rely on the overlay screen coordinates. I am also hoping that there will be non player dino spawns added as well, because at the moment, if playing as a carnivore you need to be able to seek out other players to satiate your hunger and there are only limited numbers of players in each server at one time - if you are the only one in the server you are likely to start starving.","February 14","true","4.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This way, the herbivores won't know if you are talking about eating them as a carnivore. ;)\nEach class has it's pros and cons, making every dinosaur a different experience with different challenges. Some people have complained that it's difficult to figure out the controls since the game doesn't have any kind of tutorial, but you honestly can just go into your options and find all the listed controls and keybinds if you are confused.\nBeing multi-player, obviously it can get a bit frustrating when someone you thought was your packmate ends up taking a bite out of you, but honestly it is half the fun! The game doesn't babysit and it doesn't make things easy for you, making it a challenging life as a dinosaur.\nWant to play with friends and have trouble finding eachother? Say no more! Press the "insert" key on your keyboard to pull up an information screen which also holds coordinates! If you know how to use them, you can find your friends easily. (If you don't have an insert key, just go into your keybinds and change it to a key you do have)\nWorried about the community or the developers? Concerned they don't care?\nWell, like most communities, there are ups and downs. However, the developers are some of the MOST active I've ever seen! They are truly dedicated. Since I downloaded the game they have updated EVERY DAY. I'm not even joking. They regularly listen to complaints and try to fix them ASAP, and are constantly improving the experience. Just last night they hosted a Livestream where they were answering questions while they showcased their developments on the game!\n\nTLDR; This is a multi-player take on a dinosaur simulator that has dedicated developers and despite being Early Access, is a ton of fun! If you are willing to put up with some glitches and are willing to support an in-progress game, this is definitely for you.","May 27","true","23.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are some funny moments being that every other dinosaur is another player, but a lot of people do take it seriously. Species sectioned themselves with their own kind, protecting themselves and the herd. This includes things that happen in nature such as sacrificing one member so the herd can survive, practicing flanking a herd to cut off one from the group.\n\nIt can even be peaceful, just sitting all together in a lake or a field, carnivores and herbivores safe together.\n\nI adore this game so much, it updates so often. 4 new species have arrived in the span of about 2 weeks, including other tools to help make the game easier to play and understand.","February 21","true","83.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

The main issues with this is that Mac players cannot play on any of the main servers because they all are more updated than we are. Recently there has been a test server available at our update level that we are able to use but the lack of availability has inspired us to get together and form our own group.\n\nWe have formed this as a place for Mac users to have their own community in addition to the official Isle discussion forums (due to the fact that our gameplay experience is becoming progressively more different than PC players due to update differences.) We are in the process of setting up our own dedicated server so that Mac players will always have at least one server available to them at all times.\n\nAnyone who is on Mac thinking about playing this game is welcome to join the group, that is where we will be posting updates about the server and will be planning times to play together, etc.\n\n\n"The Isle // Mac Users"  ➔ Connect with the Isle Mac Community\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/TheIsleMacUsers","June 1","true","25.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Game Review.\n\nIn this review i will adress the good and the bad parts of this game as well as glitches and other various annoyances.\n\nGood Aspects.\n-map functions and dinosaur designs are well done and they move without glitches.\n\n-Roars. The roars are very well recorded and sound realistic.\n\n-Stamia, Food and water bars. The desgin for these bars are well done and work well without very many glitches.\n\n-Species only chat. This is a extremely good idea as it adds an element of unpredictablity to the game. If the carnivores cannot see the herbivore chat then they cannot predict how they are going to act how where a herd is.\n\nBad Aspects and Glitches.\n-Tree glitch. The tree glitch is for herbivores that the fact they cannot eat to gain food as the tree doesnt vanish.\n\n-Chat room idiots. For the final version of the game, i demand that certain commands be availble to the public for usage such as /ignore Because some people are to idiotic to even listen to in the chat rooms.\n\n-Dryasaurs. Currently the herbivore Dryasaurs cannot attack anything. Please make this dinosaur atleast have a way to defend itsself cause other than that it is completely useless.\n\n-LAG!. spam roaring causes the game to lag. If there is any way to make the game less laggy that would be appreciated.\n\nSuggestions.\n- More tree types for herbivores. IN the final game the bigger and taller Herbivores should be feeding from taller trees while the smaller ones should be feeding on shrubs and ferns close tot he ground. Right now the game only has one type of tree that Herbivores can eat from. And with the glitch it makes it harder for herbivores to find a food sources.\n\n-Omivore class. In the final game there should be the historical accorate three dinosaur classes, the Omivore class should consist of dinosaurs that can both eat meat and plant life. This includes Egg eaters.\n\n-Mini Map. In the final version of the game each server should be able to turn on a Mini map displaying the map and area. This will make it easier for friends to find eachother and for people to find important land marks such as Lakes and Rivers without having to rely on cordinates and wondering. Since not all people can properly ready cordinates.\n\n-Health bar. A bar should be displayed somewhere on the screen to show a dinosaurs health just as the stamia, food and water bars are displayed.\n\n-Nests. Nests should be added as a way of setting a spawn point. Furthermore Egg laying should also be availble to spawn in npcs for a pack.\n\n-Dinosaur genders. Female and Male dinosaurs should have variations in size, colour, and attacks to distinct between the genders.\n\nFinal Concusion.\n\nThis game is a very well thought out one. But without the mods and developers working together to create and improve it this game will go no where. I do not care about  persoinal issues the develoipers may have. You cannot just stop working on a game once you have started it. NO matter how hard it is to design and implement a game you should alwways keep at it. This game has a very good idea behind it and lets face it there arent may other dinosaur games where you yourself are the dinosaur. However i should warn that I (And hopefully many other people) expect this game to be accurate in the portation of the dinosaurs.  The final release should be fantastic and i know game developers are not miricle workers.\n\nBut still i think many people have expectations for the final release of the game. I jsut hope developers can work together to make the game fully made and bug free. Im not expecting a game like Ark Survival Evolved. If this game turned out like that i wouldnt even be able to play it. The game is small enough that my Mac laptop can run it without to much lag on it.","February 28","true","94.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Well I agree it is a survival game, but you're a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed herbivore so start acting like one. Herbivores don't run down predators. They defend their herd where they are.

I don't remember what I paid, but I regret it.\n\nThe game is completely broken balance wise and HEAVILY favors the Herbivore players who can decimate any Raptor player and Carnosaur player, and 70% of the Herb species can wreck a T-Rex as well. All of the herbivores are very nimble, take WAY too many bites from a T-Rex to kill, but can 1-3 shot you.\n\nI don't even care enough to write this review properly. It's bad.\n\nThere will be a ton of people who will say "You have to hunt in packs." - You don't get enough food from a kill to sustain 1 person much less a pack. You will take WAY more damage than you will ever heal off a kill outside of killing helpless herbivores like the Gallimimus. (So which herbivores do you think players play?

BUT this is a unique survival game, plus its early alpha! So don't buy it expecting it to stay the same. With each patch they are making this more and more brutal. By brutal I mean if you run at break neck speed and trip over a little ledge then yes you will break your leg. If you lay out in the middle of huge area afk you will most likely die, there is no map for you to find your way, either learn through your surroundings, or through the coordinates they provide. ALWAYS be aware of your surroundings, and DO NOT trust everyone... even people of your own species will attack you at some point.\n\nIf you want relaxation and to be left alone, this isn't the game for you. Also the developers don't put up with complaining / whining over how difficult things get or that they haven't released your favorite dinosaure yet. So if you can't handle that then don't buy it... just want to point this out because i've seen negative reviews due to the developers being "rude".","April 27","true","149.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

This is an ultra-realistic game, and everything is very accurate, including the dinosaurs themselves, and the world. You can even break your leg, which becomes very annoying after a while. Unfortunatley there are a few flaws which kind-of break emmersion/the game itself. Number one and probably the most noticable to new players who have experience with literally any other game which allows you to interact with things (by pressing E), you are unable to eat anything BUT trees. As a smaller dinosaur such as a dryosaurus, or literally anything other than a puertasaurus (The game's currently only sauropod). The next issue is the fact that you may or may not be able to limp or feign limp on water. Another HUGE issue is with sounds. On a lot of dinosaurs, there are one or more calls which do not emit any sound when activated. This may be due to the recent additions of sound settings, but even with the highest sound quality, mainly the 'friendly' (num-bar 2) call and the Generic Roar (f) have been disfunctional for several different creatures. What I think may fix it is either removing the sound quality settings altogether OR making the Epic setting allow and encompass ALL sounds in-game instead of just most of them, which is what I think could be the issue. Another issue involving sounds are the fact that some dinosaurs have the wrong death sounds. For instance, when I am damaged or die as a gallimimus, for some reason I will sound like a carnotaurus. But enough of THAT rant, I am aware this is early access after all. This is overall a good game with  a lot of potential, and I hope this goes on to become a game which could be left to never update again, yet the community would be completely fine with the decision because the game is so polished. A good thing about the game is the growing variety of dinosaurs to play as and the imminent addition of pterosaurs, and eventually aquatic reptiles. Those are just the confirmed ones, what if there will be prehistoric mammals such as Gigantopithicus or Wooly Rhinocerous in the future? Maybe there will be mammal-like reptiles from before the dinosaurs, and maybe even the ancient, HUGE insects such as arthropleaura and meganeura? Titanboa is confirmed, so really the possibilities are endless. Well, maybe they have an end, but there's a heck of a lot of prehistoric creatures. And there's something about making herds in this game that just pumps you up, and the fact that it's so dangerous even for big herds is really cool. Other players definatley are the biggest risk to you, but as long as you have a big enough herd and a fit dinosaur, you'll probably be fine. Humans will add even more to the mayhem. Just imagine, your herd of shantungasaurus is about to fight a pack of t-rex in a clearing. Suddenly a band of hunters walks in on the scene, and suddenly it's a 3-way battle of life and dinner. The scene I have just described will only be even more epic with time and with the end of the game's beta.","January 18","true","90.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

After the rip-offs with Primal Carnage 2 from beloved fans, after The Stomping Land was left rotting by the one person that brought it to life and after ARK needed more than it could give, comes a dinosaur game that gives everything it can.\nAnd it does so perfectly.\n\nThere have been some arguments going around in the dev team, which resulted in the skin designer being fired. A lot of people, including me, were upset and read and listened through lies and truths to find out, what happened. In the end, the game still stands, it still works, and it's still perfect.\n\nAs of now, you can choose to be a dinosaur and wander the wilds on different, big maps. You wanna do so as a little Raptor and hide in the high grass? Perfect! You wanna trample the grass as a T-Rex? Go for it! Or you wanna trample the T-Rex as a Broncho? ♥♥♥♥ING YES YOU CAN!\nThe game offers a lot of varieties of different dinosaurs, maps, attacks, roars and fractions.\nYou can either roam together as a herd and find others who might join your group, or go alone and hunt others. It's all up to you.\nThe skins have been taken out as of now (06.02.16) but will be reimplented, maybe even with a Workshop for you own artistic dinosaur skins.\n\nPro:\n- Amazing dinosaur gameplay\n- Realistic roars\n- Huge maps\n- Hunger & Thurst\n- Good looking textures\n- Easy to get in to\n-  Addicting\n\nCon:\n- Early Access (Talking out of experience, doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing.)\nThat's all I can think of.\n\nAs said before, the game is Early Access, which means two things:\n- It is being developed as you play it, meaning you pay to "test" a product. Depending on your likings, it can be amazing, like for me, or not so good. The game you're playing right now might not be the final product.\n- It might never get finished.\n\nBut regardless of those two points, The Isle is one of the few rare Early Access games that just rock.\nAs a dinosaur fan or just a normal interestes person, the game is awesome. There's a lot to come and maybe also a lot to go, but it will be good.\n\nI remember I got the first ever playable Alpha from their FaceBook in a ZIP. And I would have never imagined THIS.

Anyways keep up the good work and buy this game before I make you!","March 26","true","71.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ratsz/recommended/376210/","ratsz","The Stranger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ratsz/","105 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is it.\nA dinosaur game that finally stands up for what it promises. After the rip-offs with Primal Carnage 2 from beloved fans, after The Stomping Land was left rotting by the one person that brought it to life and after ARK needed more than it could give, comes a dinosaur game that gives everything it can.\nAnd it does so perfectly.\n\nThere have been some arguments going around in the dev team, which resulted in the skin designer being fired. A lot of people, including me, were upset and read and listened through lies and truths to find out, what happened. In the end, the game still stands, it still works, and it's still perfect.\n\nAs of now, you can choose to be a dinosaur and wander the wilds on different, big maps. You wanna do so as a little Raptor and hide in the high grass? Perfect! You wanna trample the grass as a T-Rex? Go for it! Or you wanna trample the T-Rex as a Broncho? ♥♥♥♥ING YES YOU CAN!\nThe game offers a lot of varieties of different dinosaurs, maps, attacks, roars and fractions.\nYou can either roam together as a herd and find others who might join your group, or go alone and hunt others. It's all up to you.\nThe skins have been taken out as of now (06.02.16) but will be reimplented, maybe even with a Workshop for you own artistic dinosaur skins.\n\nPro:\n- Amazing dinosaur gameplay\n- Realistic roars\n- Huge maps\n- Hunger & Thurst\n- Good looking textures\n- Easy to get in to\n-  Addicting\n\nCon:\n- Early Access (Talking out of experience, doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing.)\nThat's all I can think of.\n\nAs said before, the game is Early Access, which means two things:\n- It is being developed as you play it, meaning you pay to "test" a product. Depending on your likings, it can be amazing, like for me, or not so good. The game you're playing right now might not be the final product.\n- It might never get finished.\n\nBut regardless of those two points, The Isle is one of the few rare Early Access games that just rock.\nAs a dinosaur fan or just a normal interestes person, the game is awesome. There's a lot to come and maybe also a lot to go, but it will be good.\n\nI remember I got the first ever playable Alpha from their FaceBook in a ZIP. And I would have never imagined THIS. Great work, guys.\nI  can feel it.\n\n10/10","January 28","true","6.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","21"

I would recommend this game to anyone who would like to just play a slow-paced game with friends or alone, that would enjoy roaring, bobbing up and down, and grouping up to accomplish user-made goals.

You play as a dinosaur in a "survival" setting, living the day to day life of a dino. They have a decent ammount of dinos in the game right now but it seems everyone only plays Rexes, seeing how they are the top of the food chain more or less. You spawn into the map at a randomly generated spawn point and work your way towards water and food. As a carnivore you have to hunt other players for food and as herbivores you eat certain trees/bushes depending on what map your playing on. As such being certain dinosaurs have their own perks and cons that make you feel like your part of a dinosaur world.\nOne of the worst things about this game though so far is how people play this "survival" game. Most people consider this game as a dino deathmatch simulator and only spawn in as rexes and go on killing sprees across the map without even trying to survive. Besides that it is great fun to play with your friends or have your friends in the same game as you but as a different specices. To hunt as a pack of raptors is extremely enjoyable. If you want a survival game that you play as a dinosaur instead of the generic human/zombie open world survival game this is def for you.","May 13","true","52.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You see one, your instantly friends so that you can survive long enough to fill your belly.\n- the overall atmosphere of the game.\n- the perilous journeys you have to embark on to find other herds or your food if a carnivore.\n- the fact that you don't get a map.....because you are a dinosaur and have no use for one. You have to navigate by landmarks and general direction, adds some butt puckering moments when your walking through a forest and come across a pack of t rexes and your all by your lonesome.\n- this is similar to gta online except with dinosaurs. And way better too.\n\nThings I dislike about the game:\n- the only real problem I have with it are the servers, but I know these will be tended to as it's still early access.\n\nOverall. This game is amazing. It's truly cut from its own cloth, i recommend buying it.

This is an ultra-realistic game, and everything is very accurate, including the dinosaurs themselves, and the world. You can even break your leg, which becomes very annoying after a while. Unfortunatley there are a few flaws which kind-of break emmersion/the game itself. Number one and probably the most noticable to new players who have experience with literally any other game which allows you to interact with things (by pressing E), you are unable to eat anything BUT trees. As a smaller dinosaur such as a dryosaurus, or literally anything other than a puertasaurus (The game's currently only sauropod). The next issue is the fact that you may or may not be able to limp or feign limp on water. Another HUGE issue is with sounds. On a lot of dinosaurs, there are one or more calls which do not emit any sound when activated. This may be due to the recent additions of sound settings, but even with the highest sound quality, mainly the 'friendly' (num-bar 2) call and the Generic Roar (f) have been disfunctional for several different creatures. What I think may fix it is either removing the sound quality settings altogether OR making the Epic setting allow and encompass ALL sounds in-game instead of just most of them, which is what I think could be the issue. Another issue involving sounds are the fact that some dinosaurs have the wrong death sounds. For instance, when I am damaged or die as a gallimimus, for some reason I will sound like a carnotaurus. But enough of THAT rant, I am aware this is early access after all. This is overall a good game with  a lot of potential, and I hope this goes on to become a game which could be left to never update again, yet the community would be completely fine with the decision because the game is so polished. A good thing about the game is the growing variety of dinosaurs to play as and the imminent addition of pterosaurs, and eventually aquatic reptiles. Those are just the confirmed ones, what if there will be prehistoric mammals such as Gigantopithicus or Wooly Rhinocerous in the future? Maybe there will be mammal-like reptiles from before the dinosaurs, and maybe even the ancient, HUGE insects such as arthropleaura and meganeura? Titanboa is confirmed, so really the possibilities are endless. Well, maybe they have an end, but there's a heck of a lot of prehistoric creatures. And there's something about making herds in this game that just pumps you up, and the fact that it's so dangerous even for big herds is really cool. Other players definatley are the biggest risk to you, but as long as you have a big enough herd and a fit dinosaur, you'll probably be fine. Humans will add even more to the mayhem. Just imagine, your herd of shantungasaurus is about to fight a pack of t-rex in a clearing. Suddenly a band of hunters walks in on the scene, and suddenly it's a 3-way battle of life and dinner. The scene I have just described will only be even more epic with time and with the end of the game's beta.","January 18","true","90.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

This deals with whether or not the game is worth your money at the moment.\n\nAt first glance, one might think... oh, good lord, another dinosaur game - doesn't ARK have this covered? Well, not really. Here, for the time being anyway, the focus is on playing as dinosaurs. They say it is a survival game, but like many survival games in early access, it's more of an unbalanced deathmatch. Perhaps, when it's got progression or something to make you actually think more about survival, risk and reward, it may have something to offer. But, at the moment, when the novelty wears off, it wears off in a huge way. So, I can't really recommend the game in its current state - even as early access. My recommendation may change as the game develops, but this is very much pre-alpha stuff at the moment.\n\nThe game has potential (although, the dev's plans seem to go off the rails a bit... psychic abilities?!)

They give you no incentive to survive, no power boost, no levels, no scoreboard for time survived, nothing, just run around until you die, respawn, rinse and repeat. They shouldn't release a game in this condition. ESPECIALLY for the price of 17$! This and Early access are 2 very different things. I can name several Early access fresh release titles that were miles better than this game for around the same price (ARK and 2013 Rust) Maybe later in development the game will be better, but as it stands this game isn't worth its price.

There isn't very much to do at this point, but it doesn't bother me at all. There will also be humans and cannibals in the future, which is a little concerning to me. I'd rather see the developers make this a fully-fledges realistic, dinosaur survival game, without human, guns and other stuff. They did say that they wanted to make the best dinosaur game ever, so.

This is an ultra-realistic game, and everything is very accurate, including the dinosaurs themselves, and the world. You can even break your leg, which becomes very annoying after a while. Unfortunatley there are a few flaws which kind-of break emmersion/the game itself. Number one and probably the most noticable to new players who have experience with literally any other game which allows you to interact with things (by pressing E), you are unable to eat anything BUT trees. As a smaller dinosaur such as a dryosaurus, or literally anything other than a puertasaurus (The game's currently only sauropod). The next issue is the fact that you may or may not be able to limp or feign limp on water. Another HUGE issue is with sounds. On a lot of dinosaurs, there are one or more calls which do not emit any sound when activated. This may be due to the recent additions of sound settings, but even with the highest sound quality, mainly the 'friendly' (num-bar 2) call and the Generic Roar (f) have been disfunctional for several different creatures. What I think may fix it is either removing the sound quality settings altogether OR making the Epic setting allow and encompass ALL sounds in-game instead of just most of them, which is what I think could be the issue. Another issue involving sounds are the fact that some dinosaurs have the wrong death sounds. For instance, when I am damaged or die as a gallimimus, for some reason I will sound like a carnotaurus. But enough of THAT rant, I am aware this is early access after all. This is overall a good game with  a lot of potential, and I hope this goes on to become a game which could be left to never update again, yet the community would be completely fine with the decision because the game is so polished. A good thing about the game is the growing variety of dinosaurs to play as and the imminent addition of pterosaurs, and eventually aquatic reptiles. Those are just the confirmed ones, what if there will be prehistoric mammals such as Gigantopithicus or Wooly Rhinocerous in the future? Maybe there will be mammal-like reptiles from before the dinosaurs, and maybe even the ancient, HUGE insects such as arthropleaura and meganeura? Titanboa is confirmed, so really the possibilities are endless. Well, maybe they have an end, but there's a heck of a lot of prehistoric creatures. And there's something about making herds in this game that just pumps you up, and the fact that it's so dangerous even for big herds is really cool. Other players definatley are the biggest risk to you, but as long as you have a big enough herd and a fit dinosaur, you'll probably be fine. Humans will add even more to the mayhem. Just imagine, your herd of shantungasaurus is about to fight a pack of t-rex in a clearing. Suddenly a band of hunters walks in on the scene, and suddenly it's a 3-way battle of life and dinner. The scene I have just described will only be even more epic with time and with the end of the game's beta.","January 18","true","90.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

The game has many dino choices big and small, carnivore and herbivore. there are no omnivores yet, but I believe the devs will make one.\nThe game includes massive maps with realistic environments, and detailed, realistic models. You need to hunt to survive as a predator, and you also need to find water. Some people decide to 'carebear' and take care of the enemy species. For example, A T-rex will protect a Shantungosaurus from a pack of starving raptors. Realistic, huh. If you see those people just kill them. it will make you feel good.\nI reccomend this game because it is already better than ARK: Survival Evolved.

Most dinosaur games are you play as human or you play as dino, and this game will have both!  Animations are awesome graphics can be a pain if you don't have a good computer but, high graphics are awesome.\n\nThis has been said many times over and over again the devs take crap they don't deserve for things, the comunity is terrible to the devs, constantly asking for quetzal and release dates for updates but this has been done with quetzal, they said it was delayed for seven months, like right before I got the game.  This didn't make me that mad untill I saw everybody posting things about adding quetzal, that made me question it but then it got annoying because of TOO many pepole asking for it. And BTW release dates would NOT work with this comunity,\n\nNow on to the gameplay!  The combat needs more work but it's an early access game so most of theese problems with be fixed so no worries.  So what I mean by the combat being a little lack luster right now is no collision (this will be added) the was that blood always comes out of the same spot for every dinosaur making it look like it comes out of the air (this will probally be fixed) so yeah most of everything that I do not like about the combat will probally be fixed.  But there is one thing I'm not sure about that thing is if sombody is in a pack or herd with you they should NOT be able to hurt you, because imagine you are a rex with 7 other rex's you come by a herd of 8 trike's you lose because someone in your pack hits you (not meaning too) this should also be added because of pepole betraying you, imagine your a shantu and you have a HUGE herd and somebody in the herd starts attacking pepole.  This would force a player to be in a herd or pack with pepole around it.\n\nI do recomend this game to everybody who likes dinosaurs and to other pepole of different groups.  It's a overall fun game with lots of realistic things like the most accurate T-rex I've ever seen in my like (yes I know that's somping land's model) but still the other dinosaurs are accurate too like, carno, therizino, gally, austro, shantu, and many others.  One other thing I have said before is there needs to be a back kick for larger dinosaurs with mouse 3 and for peurta (since it already has a back kick) it should have a choice between tail whip and back kick.  Back kick RMB (or right mouse button) and tail whip should be mouse 3 (scroll) and the peurtas stomb attack with LMB (left mouse button) should be somewhat faster so pepole can still doge it but not so easy.","May 9","true","92.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The problems I've ran into is the OP dinosaur attacks and lack of need to survive besides the dangers of other dinosaurs hunting you. The Therizinosaurus needs work, its main attack being able to 1-shot even a T-rex, it can be annoying when your simply chilling with friendlies at the main pond and a stray ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ comes and screws it up because not only does he have the most damaging attack, but he can come back within minutes by getting a nearby spawnpoint with a fully grown dinosaur ready to kill. Not only that, but the smaller dinosaurs although not being OP can be annoying as ♥♥♥♥ when your playing a dinosaur with a short turning speed simply because they can always be at the back end of you and continue to bite you for a minute untill you bleed out because you cant get them. All in all, its an amazing game even at this state, and even though with some serious considderation as if the price tag is worth it at this time, you should definantly, without a doubt buy this when its on sale or not.","May 14","true","13.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

You play as a dinosaur in a "survival" setting, living the day to day life of a dino. They have a decent ammount of dinos in the game right now but it seems everyone only plays Rexes, seeing how they are the top of the food chain more or less. You spawn into the map at a randomly generated spawn point and work your way towards water and food. As a carnivore you have to hunt other players for food and as herbivores you eat certain trees/bushes depending on what map your playing on. As such being certain dinosaurs have their own perks and cons that make you feel like your part of a dinosaur world.\nOne of the worst things about this game though so far is how people play this "survival" game. Most people consider this game as a dino deathmatch simulator and only spawn in as rexes and go on killing sprees across the map without even trying to survive. Besides that it is great fun to play with your friends or have your friends in the same game as you but as a different specices. To hunt as a pack of raptors is extremely enjoyable. If you want a survival game that you play as a dinosaur instead of the generic human/zombie open world survival game this is def for you.","May 13","true","52.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You see one, your instantly friends so that you can survive long enough to fill your belly.\n- the overall atmosphere of the game.\n- the perilous journeys you have to embark on to find other herds or your food if a carnivore.\n- the fact that you don't get a map.....because you are a dinosaur and have no use for one.

This ficticionalized scenario of dinosaurs of different periods and stages at the same place may let people play as all their favourite dinosaurs (tough more dinosaurs are about to be added). It also provides an accurate image of almost all the dinosaurs in the game (Examples: T. rex shows accurate sized tooth crowns, accurate snout shape and triceratops' paw shapes are accurate, tough austroraptor probably had more feathers).\n\nThe fact that it is also a multiplayer game only makes it more dinamic as people may play diffrently (there are always those that only try to harass others for a moment), but it may also provide a great survival experience sometimes.","June 2","true","83.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'd much prefer an actual game with few classes rather than an aimless dinosaur walking simulator with several.\n\nWhile the gameplay, which is the main reason why i refuse to go back to this game, may improve, there are two massive points that i'm afraid will not change any time soon: the community and the dev team.\n\nThe community is just awful, i wouldn't be surprised if i'd get fanboys screaming at me for daring making a negative review about their beloved "game", but i wish it was only that...if you join almost any server you'll see people screaming at each other almost 24/7, usually just raging away.\n\nYou will probably find carnivores being "friendly" towards herbivores, usually engaging herbivore herds doing some kind of "friendly dance" (basically spam crouching), and then either:\nA) they just move on.\nB) they sit there and offer themselves to protect the herd (ugh), raging if the herbivores do not accept them or if another predator attack their new "friends".\nC) they attack the herbivores as soon as they lower their guard, if they take the bait.\nThere are also several herbivores going on killing sprees against everything that moves, i could go on for ages, but i guess it's time to move onto the last point.\n\nFinally, the dev team: it's true they do churn out small bug fixes, classes and skins, but that's not my point, they are good devs, but they are not exactly great people.\nThe main dev, Dondi, is extremely rude and often slanders his own game's community in his streams.\nModerators encouraging public shaming (seriously), everyone is simply rude and incapable of relating with the community.\n\nAll in all, this game has been a HUGE disappointment for me and i highly doubt i'm gonna pick it up again in the near future, MAYBE if they'll give us an actual gameplay, but that's still a "maybe".\nI don't recommend this game unless you're content of a sandbox with accurate dinosaur models.\nNow let the fanboy salt begin in the comments","March 23","false","2.8"," 27 of 55 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","27","55","3","13"

As soon as you charge money for a product that excuse goes out the window.\n\nFew months ago I bought this game, 1 hour later refunded it cause it was just a pile of ♥♥♥♥ with nothing to do in it.\nAfter hearing they added more content I went back and honestly it hooked me for about 4 days. But it had glaring issues, while it ran ok for me the ping was anything but ok, dying from attacks too far away for them to even connect and having a stupid ping display.\n\nThe Dinosaur models and the rawrs which are your means of communication are cool. But that back fires when you have a chat system but you can't see names above peoples heads.... I guess so you don't know when you're being hunted or hunting. The game is barebones as it can get, all you're doing is spawning Find Food, Find Water, socialise. You may die.... that's it, no real progression system, no tutorial, no help, nothing. Just pure gameplay, which would be fine if it didn't suck complete ♥♥♥. If you so much as fall an nats ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ onto the ground, you will break your bones meaning you move painfully slow and chances are will resort to suicide, but you can't resort to the suicide key because you have to play as that character for 15 minutes! Oh and you spawn ridiclously far away from anything decent often walking for miles and if you break a leg.... thats it enjoy jumping of a cliff at a slow speed which may or may not kill you, tiny dinos are the worse and the biggest one herb, they slowly fall down and don't take damage and takes the 15 minutes just to attempt it! The broken bones is a failure on game design and now this inept game dev decided lets add bleeding to the game... cool idea, bad execution. You see before it was a no brainer, if you're a raptor and fight a t rex, the raptor will lose, now the raptor jumps on, hold on till you bleed and/OR break bones which is easy, jump off, run away and easy kill. Dinosaurs cannot attack you 80% of the time in this game.\n\nIf you get behind a dino that can only attack from the front, you win. Turning is so slow and most of the time you die in like 3 hits, maybe less. Herbivores are vicolously over powered compared to most carnivores, T Rex, does 700 DMG, 1700 hp, attack from the front but slow. Shantu which is smaller than a t rex has 2800 Hp, does a fast ground pound Aoe that does 700 damage and is faster than a t rex. You'd think cause you're a t rex hunting you'll get the drop on these guys even if they herd. Nope, they always hang around the popular water holes which have no places to hide and are all open so they see you coming and will do you in, in seconds.\nThis game is rideled with glitches and poor game decisions and is just a ripullsive fart on the store page. Honestly the only reason why this game has so much attention is because it is the only game where you play and act as a dinosaur, Ark had the ability to ride them but never control them and see through thier eyes.\n\nTL;DR, this game is a mess, it's ♥♥♥♥ poor design decisions like breaking bones, map design and now bleeding need to be either ajusted or removed, dinosaurs need counters to raptor maulings, a solo raptor should not be able to either jump on a dino and maul for abit and make for example a trex bleed to death in seconds and a counter to hiding behind you, non stop attacking making it impossible to fight back because they follow you exactly so you can't turn your head to bite them back. Maybe the ability so when you press S you walk backwards or all dinos get a back attack like a tail whip. Maybe later add the ability so both dinosaurs get locked into a fight and they have to button mash buttons and whomever wins gets to win that round, we could reinact that rex vs spino fight in JP3 or the raptors vs rex scene in JP1... but this "game" (it's not a game it's a rage simulator filled with ♥♥♥♥) has potential and will probably give it another go in the future but remeber this, just because a game is ADDICITIVE, does not mean it's FUN or GOOD....\n\nAnd with that, you kids can make up your minds if you wanna invest in such a mess in hopes oneday it will become the dinosaur game of the Period, me? I'd much rather invest in a game that actully has potential and deliverying on it's promisses and does not charge upfront for a ♥♥♥♥ing alpha, Yandere Simultor.\n\nEdit: Oh and if you have to resort to regular visits to the wiki and Game Guides just figure ♥♥♥♥ out, you've failed as a game designer...","April 28","false","16.0"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","7"

A big issue with this is that you can't heal from it (or, if you can, it takes more than the 10 minutes I  had the patience to wait).\nAnother one of the bigger problems is not being able to change dinosaur whenever you want, the option to do so is just not there and I don't understand why. The only way to change dino is when you die and, since they made a 15 minutes suicide cooldown, when you  break your legs you have to end up waiting before changing dinosaur. They also made the mistake to not kill your character when you log off so now if you wanted to change character by logging back in, you're just gonna find your dino with broken legs and the 15 minute cooldown start over. This last thing is also very stupid because there's no progression so killing the dino literally made no changes.\n\nSo yeah, I can't really recommend playing it (especially for 20$), it was better before the recent updates.","April 9","false","9.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wildfishman/recommended/376210/","wildfishman","fishman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wildfishman/","322 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI have to edit this review.  I had initially reviewed as negative because of the bordum.  I have since put a lot more time into the game, and I have been on some fun servers.  However, most of the time I spawn on the other side of the map from the normal spawn, so most of my time is spent traveling, VERY SLOWLY, to where everyone else is.  It takes over two hours sometimes to make it carefully to other players, and if I break a leg (that happens a LOT!) then it takes even longer.\n\nIt is just not worth the time traveling because the play value of the actual combat, it's just not worth it.  The game suffers from being an arena game in an arena so massive that it can take half a day to accomplish anything, and there is nothing really to accomplish because there is no leveling, no skill tree, when you die you just restart with no loss of anything.  There is no XP gain, the only thing you really lose is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of time.  And you will lose a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of time no matter what you do!\n\nThis game is very very very early development, and I hope this isn't all they plan to incorporate into the game, because it will most definitely fail.  I think they plan on having humans, clans, etc. so there is still hope.\n\nAs for now, I don't recommend the game unless you just love the concept because the game is very slow to introduce new features, and there is no clear picture on where it will go at this time.","April 17","false","17.2"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

Okay, I'm going to say I don't recommend the game at this moment for multiple reasons. Hostile/immature devs and not much content.\n\nFirst of all, I don't believe in supporting Devs who feel like they don't owe their paying customers anything. Theres been a few times when I've seen this type of attitude from the Devs.  I rarely go to Devs twitch chats or talk to the in the actual game, but when I do they're always talking down on players calling them "Stupid" and are almost making smart remarks with bad attitudes. Just because we enjoy the game, doesn't mean that we should support it if the Devs have bad attitudes. They have banned many players over same issues. I have yet to have a confrontation with the Devs, but I have to say they are some of the most immature team of Devs I've ever experience. Insulting fans and other game development teams is enough to not support their game, unfortunately for me I found out about their bad behavior way after I've breach the return policy time limit.\n\nAlso, this game lacks in content, which is to be expected, the game has about 9 Dinos at the moment and are always working on new dinos. A few Good things I have to say about the team is that they're always working on improving the game and always working on adding new content. In short they have a good worth ethic.\n\nSo conclusion, do I recommend the game at the moment? No. Not enough content for $20, some may justify it because other games has done the same, well that person fails to realize that just because one company does something bad, doesn't make it right and gives an excuse for the another company to come along and do it to. If you have $20 burning a hole in your pocket, sure why not, buy the game, but for me I would recommend this game once it has more content, probably in six months.","February 21","false","154.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","3"

You rarely encounter other players unless you spawn in a populated area and the combat is rather rough and I often found myself unable to hit people who were attacking me. The stamina system makes getting around the map even more tedious so if you spawn far away from anybody then you'll find yourself constantly running out of stamina and having to rest for like 3 minutes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JNC96/recommended/376210/","JNC96","MentallyiLLMaiasaura","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JNC96/","50 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAfter 100 hours with the game, I think it's time I re-write my review.\n\nDO NOTE: At this point the game is currently in 0.0.77, features are still incoming.\n\nSummary\nThe Isle is a gritty open world survival game that pits humans versus some of the most impressive creatures to have ever walked the Earth, the Dinosaurs. Though currently in open access, the end result will see intense combat between the primal reptiles and the relatively new rulers of earth, and the inclusion of something in between...\n\nOverview\nThe game is a lot of fun at first, however it loses it's luster, and numerous aspects of the game are working against it at the moment. It's an ambitious project however, and I hope it does well despite the challenges the developers, and to an extent us players, face as we push the game closer to official release.\n\nGameplay\nAt the moment the only mode is a free for all deathamatch, players can choose between multiple species, from classics like Triceratops, Stegosaurus, and Tyrannosaurus Rex to lesser known dinosaurs like Diabloceratops, Puertasaurus, and Austroraptor. Each dinosaur plays a little differently, and it shows in how the players use them. Once you spawn in the biggest concern is finding food and water, and depending on the animal, sometimes another player is your food, or you might just be on the menu yourself. The dinosaurs all work well together, however the game is not totally balanced yet, as the devs are planning on adding more dinosaurs and other features before getting down to the grit. There are some issues with this, me personally have found that raptor players are able to exploit the turn radii of larger dinosaurs and pretty much just bite you in the ♥♥♥ to death, and you can't do anything about it. A raptor soloing a rex is not cool, and I'll specifically say this is my biggest gripe right now.\n\nThere is a chat function that is currently species specific. There is also a WIP groupiung system that currently has little benefit but knowing who you're playing with in your group. The chat can be rather annoying at times, and there can often be trolls or immature players in the chat. People seem to get the idea it's a dinosaur chatroom simulator.\n\nThere's not much to the gameplay, and this combined with there often not being full servers can lead to very boring games where you are better off studying the map than trying to interact with other species. But as a survival game this is how they all are.\n\nAesthetics\nI play on a rather low gaming quality PC, so I can't testify to ultra settings, but I can tell you how well the game runs on low, haha.\n\nThe sounds are great, the devs took a note from Jurassic Park, and molded together the animal sounds from existing animals to create unique vocals for the dinosaurs. They Tyrannosaurus has an intimidating roar, that while is not a ferocious bellow, heralds the arrival of the king of dinosaurs. The Puertasaurus practically sings as it plods it's way across the landscape, the songs of a moving herd are almost like music. The Austroraptor chirps rather ominously in the forest at night, and it'll make your eyes dart across the trees as you move from watering hole to watering hole.\n\nThe game does not play well on lower end machines. I actually go into the console and lower my field of view and disable grass in order to reach 60 fps at I believe 800 x 640, otherwise I get less than 30. It's only going to get worse before it gets better, so if you're not at a good spot with your machine, wait until the game drops to see if it's better optimized. The dinosaurs however look great, and I really do like looking at the models move around in the world with their crisp animations.\n\nThe menus are clear and easy to understand, and the in game HUD is very nice as well! Honestly there's very few ways to muff that up, so it's a good sign the devs can get that done, lol.\n\nCommunity\nHoo boy here we go...\n\nSome games just have communities that are great, some not so much. This is a not so much.\n\nDespite the growing age of Dinosaur fans (I myself and 3 years younger than Jurassic Park, and I certainly would not have wanted my mom to let me participate in this game way back in, say, 2003 if it came out then,) The Isle's community is, well, kinda lackluster. There's a great deal of immaturity amongst the players, even myself sometimes. There's constant arguing over game mechanics, among other people constantly requesting that their favorite dinosaur be added. It's somewhat grating. There's also people who will either be quick to criticize, or quick to emptily compliment the developers. Often times in the hub it's a battle of who can write the most sarcastic reply, but that doesn't get anything done, and really actually puts me off. In a community based game that behavior is toxic and does no good.\n\nThe developers themselves, well, they're not my favorite developers ever. For an Early Access game where you have to work with your playerbase to see what works and what doesn't they don't seem to want to do much of that. Often times the devs have proven to be callous people, uninviting, rude, acidically sarcastic, and quick to throw out bans and respond to being called any of the former with throwing down the book. There's obviously a lack of professionalism in the dev team (No set dates for anything, not even estimates,) and they've made it hard to actually want this game to perform better than it's competition because they don't seem like people I really want to support, however I've played their game for 100 hours now and have decided it's for the best if we all try to make this project succeed. There has to be a compromise between both the community and the dev team in how they behave and interact both between each other and within each other.\n\nConclusion\nSo The Isle is currently a game that is really pulling along and trying to make itself as great as it can. This is crucially because of the interactions of the dev team, and the players giving it feedback.\n\nThis is a very strained relationship. Too much criticism and negativity will shut everything down, but too much complimenting and positivity won't critically look at the game and fix it.\n\nBut if you think you want this game, and you're reading this to see if you should jump in and get to playing, don't do it. A multiplayer game crucially needs the support of it's community, and the community is too infantile and snide to realize that hey, maybe if they weren't so rude to every person who has a criticism, idea, or isn't generally kissing the backside of the game and the devs, then perhaps more people would feel welcome and would participate. But no, it's a toxic and hostile environment, and you won't want to stay very long if you might think differently from the pack.\n\nTL;DR\nThe community is ♥♥♥, don't join it. Because the game needs it's community to succeed, don't buy the game and support such ridiculously juvenile behavior. Support a different game like Dinosaur Battlegrounds or Saurian instead, this one suffers from being the edgy kid in class who likes to be a jerk to everybody, but still somehow has the audcatiy to complain about being lonely. If the competition were anywhere near the same stage, it would be easy to see the holes not in the game itself, but in the people holding the game up, who are just as much a part of the experience.","March 15","false","174.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","5","11","2","5"

Like Ark survival they are adding new features without fixing what is already there but unlike ARK this game is a shell of a game so it has no redeeming factor.\n\nThe content (basicly only models and animations at this point) is good... thats mainly because the models werent made by the devs they were made for another EA game that failed...\n\nThis is probably the devs first game but i see a grim future for it.\n\nEdit March 3rd 2016: Since the time of review, some of the major bugs seem to have been fixed.(hard to play solo since you cant suicide to try the other dinosaurs) But on the other side the devs are lookin more and more like they hate their playerbase.And they deleted the whole sub-forum where people wrote bug reports for them for free, how nice...\n\nTL/DR:\nDont support this game in Early access, if you like dinosaurs just buy Ark.","January 9","false","12.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

This review is written by someone who wanted to like this game but only ended up forcing himself to play as much as he did despite being bored to the bone.\n\nThe game is about different species of dinosaurs surviving on a large island without any affect of mythical or modern day creatures. It is all about dinosaurs of different eras and that's something intriguing for players who are looking for something new, different.\n\nHowever the application of game is just same as any other survival game you'll find. Vast empty sandbox island with dinosaurs who can do nothing, I mean they really can do nothing at all other then fighting each other. For me, this is not a survival game. This is counter strike with dinosaurs.\n\nThere are no npc creatures yet, that is planned to be implemented later but so far all dinosaurs are other players, and In the servers, even in those half full, you're lucky to meet anyone. Since you are all by yourself most of the time, what else is there to do? You can not dig dirt, collect bits and branches, build a nest or do what dinoes do. All there is to actually accomplish is run around and bite others.\n\nFighting is disgracing, so far only fighting option is run into someone and swing your weapon. That can be a tail a jaw or claws. Only raptors may have the option to cling on bigger dinosaurs and claw them but other then that it is boring, distasteful, and often awkwardly short. It doesn't feel like accomplishing anything. Just, boring.\n\nThe death has no penalty, making it useless to actually put any effort into survival. That also creates trolls who walk around to kill randomly without  provocation or any worthy intention. The death screen is awkward, it just pops up out of nowhere. In 2016 you can not see what happened, or what is going on afterwards. Sometimes you just want to watch how your pack progresses with current fight but no you can not. Not allowed.\n\nThe graphics used to be laggy, too much flexy grass causing stress on graphics card but that seems fixed now, it runs smoothly and the graphics are actually really good. Even thou the dino selection screen is made for ants, i mean the preview of dinosaurs is very very very tiny, you need a magnifier to see what it actually is; once you are in the game it is exciting. The animations are nice, thou they could've been better, for an mmo they're very smooth and well designed. The environment is okay, and other then certain few menues exceeding the screen width the game is graphically above average.\n\nI wished to avoid making any positive or negative recommendation about the game for now but steam enforced me into doing so. I'll just hope there are still surprises in the developer's bag however till then there is nothing makes me want to play this game. Really, my score would be 3/10 for other players but for me it's 4/10 because i like dinosaurs after all.","March 21","false","4.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

With players being able to choose between dinosaurs, split into herbivore and carnivore factions, and humans, with a choice between the more modern mercenaries or the more primal tribals, The Isle "aspires to create a fun game that is approachable by many". Unfortunately, I feel that the game currently falls flat, and it really does pain me to say that because I want to see the game succeed. The reasons that I feel so can be divided into two parts: the game and the developers/community. If anything, I'd highly recommend you properly read through all of the store page, check out the discussion, read through the pinned topics, research the developers at least a bit, and overall research it to such an extent that you feel like you 100% know what you are getting into.\n\nThe game: It's decent for an early access game, but is no where near complete. At the moment, gameplay is extremely limited and quite frankly boring. I know I have 70+ hours on the game, but that time is spread over months of playing and quite a bit of afking. On top of that, a lot of that time has been spent doing just about nothing. Players who often find games to be repetitive will likely be bored within the first few hours. The community can also be a bit toxic. Because there isn't a lot to do, people play the game in unusual and unintended ways. To some people, that's fun. For others, it ruins the game. At the moment, this game does nothing better than similar titles, such as DayZ. The Isle has the basics down, but just barely. Of course, it will be improved to turn this negative review positive, right?\n\nWell, not exactly. There has been steady progress so far, but nothing that has really changed the state of the game. New dinosaurs? check. New skins for said dinosaurs? check. New maps? check. Bug fixes? check, though another one that's equally as bad popped up. Updates to the game's mechanics? Well, there's now a trotting system, a resting system, fall damage with broken legs system, and oh yeah, you can actually starve to death now. However, the plants for herbivores to eat still don't work properly, you can only eat the trees (they tried fixing this many months ago and it's still broken). I've yet to see an update that actually added anything worth getting excited about, I'll believe it when I see it. Of course, these things naturally take time, but the point still stands that there hasn't yet been an update that showed off that they're capable of making a great final game in the end that matches their vision. The question to ask is how will the developers and the community affect the game's development and the final product?\n\nThe developers and the community: This is where the game went from an on-the-fence neutral review from me to a negative review. The majority of the developers and the moderators can be off-putting to say the least. Some of them are what you'd expect from good developers/moderators, but the others aren't. Their take is that they "are here to make a game" rather than "babysit" their community. They aren't interested in PR at all. Which quite frankly, is fine. I'm personally not expecting them to be experts at it, they're game developers with little to no experience on PR. Nor do I expect them to cave in to every single idea, suggestion, or concern. However, once you go beneath the surface of the game it becomes a little more disappointing on how they behave. They'll do just about everything to avoid communicating anything to their fans through steam and will actively talk bad of their community behind their backs. They assume by default that near everyone in the community who disagrees with them is idiotic. Recently, 2 threads popped up, the first one regarding poor user experience, the second regarding the developers actually listening to their community. Both threads have basically been ignored by the developers, except they've talked badly about those threads in their discord channel.\n\n(Here's some of the stuff being said at the moment: http://i.imgur.com/lRuAV8W.png)\n\nI'll openly admit some of that is in reference to some of the things I've personally said, so there is a small bit of bias there. I wish I could explain my side of the story more, especially on Deathlyrage's comment on the 25 page FAQ/youtube video thing, but unfortunately I don't think I have enough space to explain everything properly and with the respect it deserves for both sides of the argument. However, this is how they respond to feedback, which is encouraged in their FAQ as being an important part of the development process. Also, keep in mind this is a continuous problem. This same stuff has been going on for months on end. I've begun to doubt whether or not they truly are capable of taking the game to the level that I'd give a positive review, so therefore it's a negative review from me. Maybe with some future updates this will change into a positive review, but right now it isn't good enough to deal with how these developers behave when there are literally hundreds of better games out there in early access with better developers to boot.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nPros:\n- Dinosaurs are cool!\n- Good graphics, great models\n- Sound is pretty tight\n- Great concept\n- Can be really fun with liked minded players\n\nNeutral:\n- Development doesn't seem to go anywhere\n- Always a few bugs that can ruin the game for some\n- Other players playstyles can also ruin the game\n\nCons:\n- Serious issues like rubberbanding and server lag\n- Not enough content that another game doesn't already do better. Fun quickly wears off.\n- Dinosaurs are slightly unbalanced which causes some of them to not be fun to play due to a lack of population (no cross species chat, so if you're the only one playing that dinosaur you essentially have no one to talk to)\n- Community is a little bit worse than your average fandom\n- Developers do not communicate well at all\n- Developers are off-putting, if not rude\n\nFinal thoughts: The game is good for early access, but I'm beginning to doubt that the developers will be able to make the game good by the end of it. If it doesn't progress, it's not a great game at all. Even then, community and developer drama is embedded deeply in the game. By the end of it, I don't think that the developers will be able "to create a fun game that is approachable by many". I doubt this game will ever appeal to many beyond a small, niche audience. If you managed to read through all that and are still not put off from the game, then maybe it's worth a shot. I'd still highly recommend reading through all of the store page, discussions, pinned topics, etc. as well as doing some thorough research on the game and the community. If anything, I'd say wait on this one. At least until they begin to add in progression and you can see how the game will play out. Chances are, if you have another game that has your interest and your deciding between the two, that other game is probably the better buy. As for me, I'll probably drop by every once in a while to see how it's going with the new updates, but until then I don't think it's worth the money.  Especially considering how the developers and the community are. Again, if that doesn't sound like it will bother you, then go for it. Just make sure to do some research and ask some questions going into it to make sure their vision for the game lines up with what you want. Because they are in a mindset that they're going to make their game exactly the way they want and nobody is going to tell them otherwise, even when a large portion of the community agrees that part of the game isn't fun mechanically or implemented poorly.\n\nUPDATE: http://i.imgur.com/nOx8bzW.png. Yes Deathly. If I like a ton more games better than this one and they have better attitudes, then of course I can't recommend this game over the others. I never said it was horrible, but I'd personally buy another game over it.","April 6","false","72.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","5"

But it was a complete waste of my money. It took 1 hr 45 min. to download and then I wasn't even able to play. It would "loading" for anywhere from 3-5 min, then at the home screen when I chose to "join a world" it would say the network or server timed out and I would have to repeat the process. When I was able to actually get in ONCE my dinosaur wouldn't even move. So after HOURS or loading, waiting, reloading, etc I wasn't even able to play.

They don't seem to care much for the players opinions, and in my opinion they're going about the game the wrong way.

The graphics are nice, there's a much larger selection of dinosaurs than in other games of its type, the community is decent, the maps are huge, and the servers have plenty of spots. On top of this, the dev team is great. They're always very active, and they listen to the community. Bug fixes are frequent, and there isn't so many major patches that new content gets boring fast.

This game is in early alpha and features are being added all the time. What is meta gameplay now, will not be the same in a few weeks. Species will be added, maps will change, and each new feature added will bring with it a whole new level of difficulty. If hardcore survival is not your thing, I'd turn away now because this game is only going to get harder as time goes on. And frankly, that's not a bad thing.\nBut it is something you'll need to understand before buying this game. Something which, apparently, a lot of people did not consider before buying and reviewing. This game was never mean to be easy, and you'll need to keep an open mind about it as it develops further. Bleeding, starvation, broken bones, and limping are all perfect examples of this. Each of these features added a whole new level of difficulty to the game and because of it, people were forced to adapt to different playstyles to survive. My point is if you can't adapt, don't purchase the game right now.\n\nHumans will be added in the future, and this open world game is only going to get bigger. Imagine the Skyrim map, Final Fantasy open exploration, and the hardcore survival of Day-Z all combined into one.\n\nPROSE:\nBeautiful maps.\nGreat Models.\nSmooth animations.\nClear sounds.\nPlenty of players.\nConstant Updates.\nVast open maps\nWide variety of characters. More coming soon\nHardcore Survival\n\nCONS\nIn Alpha\nNot fully optimised.\nDescent PC needed to run.\nLow server stability.\nVery difficult to find your friends / navigate without prior knowledge","May 6","true","88.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But by golly when I first started playing The Isle I was impressed through and through.  As it stands the game is already very VERY pretty, though my trashy computer can't appreciate in it's full glory   :( as well as the models, rigging, sounds and animations to be TOP NOTCH QUALITY.  I'm very happy to see the artist who was formally working on The Stomping Land "We all know how that ended up, thanks Jig you lazy, greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥" has found work on a new and VERY PROMISING Dinosaur title.  The forums tell of great things to come and I am proud to be an alpha tester for this game.\n\nThat said, this is an ALPHA, and an early one at that.  So there are some issues that are blaring and obvious. Like Hulk Smash(ing) herbivores and flying ragdolls, but these are all things that resolve with play testing and time.  Something that as an Alpha player I want to help along on this prodject.\n\nAs I've stated, I was extrordinarily impressed with the craftsmanship and detail that have gone into the game thus far.  As far as Alphas go, its the least buggy, best looking and most enjoyable one I've ever played.\nIf you like dinosaurs, and you like open world survival/deathmatch I cannot recommend this game more.

And please, for the love of everything holy, read and understand the Store page!\n\nAs for the game itself, it's coming along wonderfully, with regular updates, a new major addition every few weeks, and sudden bursts of bug fixes and reveals of WIP features and creatures.\nI have no doubt in my mind that this game will be amazing when finished, but right now, in-game is just one big pile of T. rex (most of them being very immature people) and mindless killing at the most popular lake, Spawn Lake, where >80% of players go to. But progression will hopefully be in soon, which means people have to work hard to unlock bigger dinosaurs so that a rex isn't nearly as common a sight as it is now.","May 21","true","515.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's just an all out brawl at all times. The herbivores chase down and kill t rexes with little to no effort.

A handfull of very colorful dinosaurs to choose from and a vast island to roam.

The community that has so far adopted the game have been pretty rewarding.

Trex cant catch up to any dinosaur but the long neck... wich one shots it.... The herbivore therizunasaurus can one shot all carnivores but t-rex, t-rex is like the only one that can really kill it in one bite. most fights right now are ring around the rosey fighting until you get a hit.its also weird when you see a herd of herbivores and friendly T-rexes. i know this game is no where near finished but its just my 2 cents. however right now its pretty much the only game where you can be a dinosaur that eats ,drinks and fights I hope this game gets more balanced and more survivalish.","January 6","true","197.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I like dinosaurs, you can see it in the games I have.  I like them, but not enough to where they are integral to a game.  I'm giving this game a reccomend as out of the survival games I have played this is a FIRST FOR ME where you are put in a different sort of playstyle in a survival game.\nThink about it.  Nearly all the games I have seen on Steam is where you go around gather this, to craft this, to build this.  Over and over again.  Sure, Ark spiced the flavour up a bit with taming but still.  This game gives you a new playstyle.\n\nThink of this as  an Alien vs. Predator game meets Ark.  Your dinosaurs are like the Aliens.  You go around killing things to get stronger or to build a herd.\nThen you have the Cannibals which are like Predators.  You leap from tree to tree, kill dinosaurs, tame dinosaurs (in a brutal fashion), and eat the human players.\nLast but not least, the humans are like the USCM.  You survive, find guns, then kill the other dinosaur/cannibal players.\n\nNow, the cannibals/humans are of course not added yet.  But the potential this game could have with all three thrown into a mix would make for an interesting game.\n\nAs of right now, it's severely lacking in content.  There isn't much risk/reward right now.  But the game is getting updated steadily.  I wouldn't neccesarily suggest buying the game right now.  Maybe when they have added 1 of the 2 other classes. Right now though, the game has promise and I hope to see it succeed.","January 29","true","38.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

When you meet up with a pack of carnivores and you just roll around killing other dinosaurs it's amazing. The game runs solid for me I have been getting a solid 60fps and I think it's a good looking world graphics wise. The dino's themselves are good looking and have good movement controls. If your like me an a sucker for dino games and also EA games i say give it a try. There might not be ark numbers of online players but i can always find at least one server with 80-100 dinos in it whenever i jump on. Also there plan is to eventually add mercenaries and cannibals into the fold so i'm excited.","February 6","true","6.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A handfull of very colorful dinosaurs to choose from and a vast island to roam. The chat system and overall interface is rudimentary at best right now and at times lag can be an issue.\n\nNow with all that on the table, it has been a TON of fun so far. The community that has so far adopted the game have been pretty rewarding. People travel in packs of Herbivores vs Carnivores and with very little meat to the gameplay have created a very entertaining experience.\n\nIf nothing else you might consider picking this one up to support the team and to sit on this egg until it hatches.","December 24, 2015","true","34.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I don't have a PC, i play the game on mac. I recently downloaded the game on my mac and launched it. I joined a small server so i could learn the controls without getting killed. But the texture for the land didn't load in. It was white and grey tiles and it really bothered me. The mountains and clearings looked weird due to this. Then it lagged really bad. (probably because of my internet) I quit and joined 30 mins later and the texture still didn't load in, but grass trees, and so on did. There was no longer any lag just the texture problem. I tried to join a popular server so i could properly play. It loaded for about 3 minutes then the game froze completely in the loading screen. I had to manually restart my computer and it then it said that the Isle was unresponsive. Once i restarted i tried to join servers like Atlanta, Germany, Chichago, New york, and some others... The same thing happened everytime. I could only join servers that had about five people on it :/ I met up with about 4 people on  a small server and every one was lagging alot again. Then the latest patch came out. I tried to join servers but it said my game was out of date and to restart Steam and update. But i did everything and it never updated. I restarted Steam at least 5 times. I changed the update systems to every possible option, then restarted. I forced the game to search for updates by right clicking the isle and doing that thing in the options in local files. I restarted my computer and everything. I know this game is in early devolpement and all but i really want to be able to play the game normally just like everyone else. I don't know why it's doing this so can you guys fix the mac build and tell me what's wrong? until then i will keep trying...","May 8","true","6.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","4"

On Thursday alone there were at least 3 patches! Kudos to you, devs.\n\nHowever, every game has its flaws. The broken-leg mechanic is kind of janky; you can trip over a patch of pebbles and break something, then be forced to wait fifteen to thirty minutes (if your food and water are over 80) for it to heal. Maybe increase the distance you have to fall a bit more, so this doesnt happen? It'd be great!\n\nAnother thing to note is the consistent connection losses or crashes. I understand that not all hosts are perfect, or games for that matter, but.. one of the other happens every half-hour or so. Gets irritating after a while.\n\nAll in all, though, I recommend it to anyone looking forward to buying The Isle, or any dinosaur lovers! Very fun if you have a decent computer, and even if flawed, worth your money.","May 7","true","22.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

It IS an early access Alpha stage game, so not much of it's real content is in the game. If you aren't willing to take the risk, or aren't patient (Two different things!) then don't buy this game yet. (YET) To the rest of you I will list the pros and cons I've come across:\n\nPros:\n- Fun game, just like, in general.\n- Fun people. It's a decent community, given it is the internet.\n- Beautiful. The game just looks good. The graphics are nice, the dinos look amazing, it's just splended.\n- YOU GET TO BE A DINO! C'mon!\n- The Devs actually TALK to you! You want to give feedback which isn't whining and B****ing? They will listen to you then!\n- Updates, patches and such are very common. There have been a few days (Since I've aquired the game) at which there were 2 patches, these Devs are hard working.\n\nCons:\n-It's only alpha, with very little actual game content in it. (I already said that, but incase you sped read past it, and don't have working eyeballs there it is again)\n-The dinos need some more balancing (They have been working on it, it's getting there)\n-Occasional lag, or lots of it if you don't turn your graphics down (even for a good computer.)\n\nAll in all this game is amazing. I'm excited to see where the Devs take it, and I am thrilled to be a part of this community and watching this game change almost daily. I can't wait to see the end product, and best of all, play it! If you have any questions, please feel free to ask! :D","January 14","true","389.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

They do appear to be straying away from the modern bird-like models however, and they are now starting to look more like they do in Jurassic Park (Although that isn't exactly a bad thing). Game seems to run fine for me, and its a fun experience. Although the game does currently have MANY major flaws.\n\n1: Servers\nMassive Multiplayer games like these need good servers, and when you seem to crash out of you're game every 30-40 minutes it just ruins the fun you and your friends are having. Not to mention that many of ther servers are flat out dead, and with only about 30 to choose from, you will more often then not find yourself in one with only 10 people because the main servers are full with around 50-70 players capped.\n\n2: Map\nThe map FEELS small. I have yet to find how small it really is, but I always spawn next to the wall (Which is just a drop off into nothing). This coupled with the very dense hills you traverse through, make it so you can never see any mountains in front of you, so the map just appears to end almost everywhere. This makes the game feel VERY small. Although the Misty Vally map is a perfect polar opposite of this, with plateaus and deep valleys, filled with fog and well mist, make the map feel open and spacious. I hope to see later maps go follow this example, or better yet, just try to make the current maps feel more open.\n\n3: Chat\nWhen you choose a dinosaur, your chat box is now exclusive to that type of dinosaur, and you can't see the other chat. This is bad in its own ways, but mainly it makes the game feel very empty. I can see where they are coming from with this, making it so you and other species can't communicate with one another and give away position. I think that instead of locking my species, they could lock it by Carnivore and Herbivore. This way, the game is still keeping the the division between species well enough that herds can't be exposed by others in the group, and the chat can be more easily used between these groups.\n\nThats about all I can think of off the top of my head, I didn't talk about anything like the camera, or ping issues (Beside Servers) because those will al be fixed in due time. I would just hope to see more "design" being placed into gameplay and immersion instead of pumping out new dinosaurs every other week.\n\nHave these be fixed, and the final product be as smooth as I hope it becomes I would give it a 7 or 8/10. I just ♥♥♥♥ing love dinosaurs.\n\nAlthough as the game is currently I would give it a 5/10.","May 9","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game may have some cool models but the pros stop around there. First lets start with the community and the players. The whole time people play this its to chat with people and be carebares (a carnivore who just lays around and doesnt do anything). Then there is the game itself, ALL confrontations are 100% already decided before they start no chance for anything else to happen like the under dog winning or anything its all based on numbers and not on skill. Then there is the complete unfriendlyness towards people who are trying to play together by making it so no matter what you will spawn far away from them and you will probably spawn near someone who is going to straight up slaughter you. Even when they introduce the necessity for food and water\n(excluding needing it to heal because it heals way to slow to even be worth doing it unless you have a herd of 10 or more) the game will still have nothing to do other than be killed if you are a herbavore and kill if you are a carnivore.","March 13","false","2.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","1"

I was excited because alot of videos gave me the idea of being able to become part of packs/herds with friends, you know a really cool dinosaur experience. The only problem is that sometimes you both spawn at opposite ends of the map. Playing the game gets repetitive and boring after a while, you just walk around and eat or drink. All I can say is just wait, I have expectations for this game and what they promise sounds awesome. I just hope it doesn't end up like the Stomping Land, where it might disappear completely. I plan to edit this review to match my current opinion of this game.\n\nPros:\n-Dinosaurs\n-Animations are awesome\n-Herding/packing up with friends or even with strangers is alot of fun\n\nCons:\n-Combat system is lackluster (As expected its Early Access game).\n-The community is the worst, its overflowing with all types of unsavory people.\n-Map size makes it a little difficult to group up with friends","May 4","false","38.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

This is an early access review\n\nThe isle is an open world dinosaur game where you can currently play for a variety of both herbivorous and carnivorous dinosaurs. Now at the moment, the only real gameplay is to spawn, wander around, and eventually die. You may say to yourself "but isnt that most survival games, if not all?"\nYes, but what this game currently lacks is not rules, but a consequence for death. You simply die and choose a new dino to spawn as. Yes, you're spawned in some random point on the map but other that you lose NOTHING. So a lot of players will just kos, gang up on random people, and just cause a general bad time.\nYes, I have had many wonderful experiences with this game but there are small details that simply add up.\n\nTo the Devs, you guys are really ♥♥♥♥ing impressive. Absolutely amazing animations, skins, sound effects. Jesus you guys nailed this part. Kudos to you.\nIf you love dinosaurs. This is by far the best around, but if you're more casual about them, I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nAgain, this game is very early access and much is subject to change","April 26","false","34.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

So unless you want terrible camera angles, TONS of bugs, and updates that makes the game worse everytime. Then this is for you.

Such as when running through the woods it's very lagy and I have a good computer. When I play as a herbivore I can't eat or drink anything maybe it's just me. The last thing is the lack of carnivores, I understand that it takes time to code and model and everything but there should be an even herb to carno ratio but all in all the Dino's rule and the game is very enjoyable.","March 30","true","65.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Also there is a wide variety of dinosaurs that are well done and make to the fact. It is a very challenging game that you might want to wait for humans or something like that but i suggest you get it now because its still a great game without any building or humans. Overall i would give this game a 10/10.","May 7","true","91.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The only pro to this game is the graphics. This games missing a kill camera like Call of duty black ops, we only need one map/ one huge map on an island no more than one map is required, add details to map like caves, mounains, lakes, forests, swamps etc... take a look at ARK Survival Evolved for example no wonder why their game is a huge success. Add more common dinosaurs like the Triceratops, spinosaurus, velociraptor, brachiosaurus, add some terasaurs and some swimmimg dinos, that includes swimming movements which no dinos right now can do. I think in a few years or if the creators can get their act together and think like a gamer this game will be a huge hit.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/icicle95/recommended/376210/","icicle95","☽Nyx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/icicle95/","107 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhere to start? This game has so many flaws I could write an entire essay about the gameplay, the community, the devs, and other things. So where is the best place to start? Clearly most reviews like to start off with the basic stuff such as the gameplay so let's start there. I do notice this is a Early Access game, but honestly, its been out for nearly four months and this is all we have so far.\nThe gameplay is horrific. Bugs are everywhere. Flying dead dinos along with annoying bugged hit boxes as well as texture loading problems. The graphics are alright, some stuff seems as if little attention was put into it such as some of the foliage. Also from time to time the textures will not load in which causes your enjoyment of the game to dwindle entirely. Honestly, I've seen two pixel games that are better then the Isle. The biggest weakness of this game is the fact that there is no purpose to it, you simply walk around as a dino and kill stuff, not very fun. People may have bought this game hoping that they could mate with other dinos and raise there babies, because that's what dinos do, and they also try to live. Instead, you are stuck with everything around you wanting to kill you, no matter if it is a tiny diablo or a freaking puerta. Like what the h***, herbivores hunting down and killing predators isn't normal? So you buy this game to enjoy being the top predator of the food chain, but instead you're lying dead in a pile of diablo s***. Because logic apparently. I could go on for days but instead let's move onto the dinos.\nYou'll be terribly disappointed to hear that the herbivores are the strongest dinos in the game, rex doesn't even make the top 3rd spot. So much for King of the Dinos, more like King of the Dryos. Since we are on the topic of rex let's move into more detail. Rex has a lot of issues, there are lots of hitbox bugs when trying to attack another rex which could get you killed in turn. Most of the time you think you have the upper hand but then the game decides you suck and let's the other player kill you somehow, even though you may have been behind it and bit it three times, it just tells you to go f*** yourself. It gets extremely frustrating because you know you have a good ping and it isn't the lag but instead it's the game itself that caused your demise. Onto the next cool dino, the allosaurus! It's basically sh**, the turning radius is about the same as a Shunt which isn't good. Rex two shots it, basically it is weak and it takes more then 6 bites to kill a rex. All in all it is not something you want to be playing right now. So up next is the Carno. The carno is fun, it's fast and agile, it is mostly for smaller prey though it can kill a puerta because that's how bada** it really is. But puerta is tough, so you may have to die four of five times before you kill the large motherf*****. Though carno isn't strong enough for a rex since the rex can turn 360 degrees with no problems and two shot the carno. For our last carnivore we have the austroraptor. It is small and quick, it isn't exactly good at killing anything, I've seen very skilled players kill larger dinos but mostly you can only kill dryos and gallis, that's about it, have fun. With all the carnivores done let us move onto the overpowered dinos who rule The Isle, the herbivores. First up we have our top predator, the Puerta! This fata** is the toughest thing you will ever see, these large dinos go on mad killing sprees killing up to 20 dinos in a single life. With so much health it can survive for a long time, but not defending itself, no instead these dinos are blood thirsty killers, sometimes they are friendly to other herbivores, sometimes not. These large beasts rule the world without a doubt. For our next extremely tough dino is the Stegosaurus. These things can kill a rex in two swipes of its tail that can bend like a snakes back. Don't question the devs because that's their logic. Honestly, you need about two to three rexes to take down one stego, it's not worth the trouble since most stegos hunt down carnivores to kill and feed from. They have been notoriously labeled, "Nazi's." As for our Shungtungasaurs they have recently been nerfed so they don't pose much of a threat except to every carnivore. These fatties don't do a whole lot, they just stomp and eat stuff, like the stegos they will chase after carnivores from time to time which gets really old seeing all these herbivores chasing carnivores. Next we have Theri, it is a cute bird that has nice long claws which it doesn't use all that much because it is usually dead before it does. They have a slow turning speed as well as a slower run from that of a galli. Mostly these things go after carnos and raptors. As I was saying about Gallis, these things are the fastest thing in the game (besides quetz that isn't out yet). They can kill a rex easily if they get behind it first, you just need patience and lots of kicks to the rex's butt. Once you have torn that rex a new a**hole you can move onto your next victim. For the Trike and Diablos they mostly do the same things, one is just the smaller then the other and does less damage. They can kill a rex relatively easy. The most deadly dino in this game by far is the Dryo, it kills with cuteness. It evades death by striking adorable cuteness in anyone's eyes. These things will f*** your life over if you end up killing them, before you know it herds of stegos will be running down the hill at you. So with the boring part of this review is done I so dearly wish to move on.\nNow for the fun bits, the flippin community. It is toxic no doubt about it. Everyone yells at everyone over the dumbest things. Most of the time you find yourself in the constant face palm position that never seems to go away. One would assume most of these players are under the age of 15 so no much intelligence there, but don't get me wrong not all of them are pains in the a**, only most. Players tend to just whine and complain about things they don't like, for example someone taking there spot on this hill or quetz won't come out we will have to wait seven months. Good riddance to them, wish it was delayed longer. And oh, don't get me started on Dondi's fanboys, if it were up to me, send them all to h***. Nobody gives a sh** about them not even their lord and saviour Dondi, he would honestly rather see you all die as well. I wish they would shut their traps and move on with life. There are other things more important then having sexy fantasies about Dondi, isn't even worth your time. And to all you hackers out there, F*** You! The game is filled with them and ironically the one's who don't actually do it get banned, but who flippin cares, right? Also, this is a game for the community, if it were freaking Dondi's dream game he wouldn't have put it up on Steam unless he wanted to use people into making his game for him, which honestly, I wouldn't be surprised. So basically Dondi is giving his community a big middle finger to all you lovely folks if that's true. Now would you kindly go suck his c***.\nSpeaking of Dondi, did you know he hates his community? Well I assume he does since he constantly insults them in his streams, he doesn't give a single f*** about his player base, he does what he does hoping you'll give him more money. He hates care bearing so much in The Isle but it is ironic when he does it himself. I'm sure he will be laughing is head off and jerking himself when he reads this because that's just the kind of guy he comes off as. His dev team is no better. All the devs seem pretty rude, their heads are up in the clouds not giving a damn, if they can't help your problem in less then a day then you are a nobody to them. Also they like to flaunt out their new class in front of you to make you jealous which is very rude to the community because they can only sit and watch from afar.\nFull review here: http://pastebin.com/P6gekeiZ","March 19","false","242.8"," 31 of 68 people (46%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","46","31","68","17","64"

What a got was mocking comments from the developer himself. I bought the game for 2 hours and refunded it. All the players were literally just laying around at the watering hole. Literally doing nothing for hours. I would imagine a croc sunbathing sim would be just as exciting. Ultimately, the developer mock customers and potential customers, the gameplay is boring, and you have to deal with camera having a seizure every time you're on uneven ground (which is all the time). Also, be ready to break your legs and become immobile for hours from poor textures near hills. This game dawns the typical early access, very small and un-noteworthy updates. No real game improvements, bare bones of a game. Obviously from the mostly positive reviews, some people like this game.

The concept sounds great but there is many issues with game play.\n\n1. The T-Rex can kill almost any dino in one bite. Can you say OP?\n2. When attacking totally no way of knowing if you are doing anything. All you do is smash your mouse button and hope.\n3. There is no HUD yet which makes it hard to know if you are even loosing a fight till you are dead.\n4. Everyone seems to enter the game in the same places. So it is spawn in get eaten or eat someone.

I was wrong. What I did notice, was a very very overestimated game, with "Updates" That are just minor fixes, like, the one that literally, only fixed ONE bug. And was taken as an "Update". From what I heard from the locals, most of the new stuff isnt coming until after the full release? I'm sorry, but that is just asking for the game to lose some fans. This game and it's updates give you the impression that the game is most likely being rushed, and people can't help but get the feeling they are simply leaving some bugs in order to make more "Updates". I'm sorry, but I highly suggest that the devs at least include some new stuff now and then. I mean, the dinos are either overpowered, or underpowered, the hitboxes are ♥♥♥♥ing rediculous, and the sauropods are literally one of the weakest things considering it never lands a hit. I do not recommend this game, it is not worth it's price in it's current state, and I feel like sadly, this game, while a good idea, will go down the wrong path. And while I am curious to see how this game tries to improve, in which I may someday change my opinion, I can't see any point in playing it right now, between the overpowered rexes, and underpowered herbivores, I'd say it deserves a 2/10 in it's current state.","December 10, 2015","false","33.1"," 6 of 21 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","6","21","0","0"

AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS!  This is nothing more then an attempt to fund a game IDEA that is less then 10% complete at it's Early Access launch.  This should be on KickStarter, not here.\n\nUn-Edited Real Time Gameplay On a 60+ Player Server:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obCY6aWGTkM\n\n- Okay, can't play more then 3 minutes without getting disconnected from any sever I connect to with this error in red in the upper left:  Error: PendingConnectionFailure Server: false\n\n- Secondly, The maps are obviously huge and look great.. but with only a few players on each server, how the hell are we ever supposed to find each other to battle?\n\n- Third, I killed a small dino (AI controlled) but then couldn't eat him even though I was hungry.  Spammed E 1000 times while moving all over and around the corpse, never did eat.\n\n- Fourth, clipping issues galore (rocks and trees)\n\n- Five.. a 40 ton t-rex just walks on water?  Come on guys, I know this is EA but FFS\n\n- Six, Why do some dinos have two attacks and some only get the left mouse button attack?  I assume its the heavier dinos that can't jump get the two attacks with both mouse buttons and the dinos that can jump only get one?  Still, this is awkward\n\n- Seven, I seen a huge plant eating dino again AI controlled and I was one the smaller ones that came up to its knees, if that.  So I attacked its legs 3,000 times to see it was useless.\n\n- Eight, Voice chat doesn't work\n\n- Nine, sliding off mountains 2,000 feet high even with a t-rex does no damage, no falling animations, just horrible.\n\n- Ten, not nearly enough blood to indicate if your bites or succeeding or not.\n\n- Eleven, everytime I launch the game... I have to reset my graphics settings over again.  Ugh.\n\n- I got excited the first time i saw little outposts with buildings and jeeps, thought maybe I could have some fun destroying them but nope, all I could do was more awkward clipping thru them!  YAY!\n\nThe developers say they have been working hard on this game for a year now, and have admitted that all the dinosuar models have been acquired from "The Stomping Lands".  The idea is cool, but right now that's all this game is right now is just ideas.  There is nothing to do here except run around, clip thru rocks, trees, and other dinosaurs until you get bored or get another network error.\n\nBeasts of Prey at its bug fest launch in early access was about 50 times more "fun" then this is right now.\n\nIf it took the developers a year of hard work to get this far, then check back in about seven more years and maybe it will be 50% complete.\n\nI understand the developers need funding to work on something like this, but Steam early access is NOT what that is for.  You aren't supposed to be charging full price for a game 10% complete.  This is what KickStarter is for, not Steam early access.\n\nThe fact this this game has 10 of 11 reviews showing postives right now is exactly why Steam reviews CANNOT be trusted.\n\nDevs.. I like your ideas for this, but take this to KickStarter and I personally will help fund this if you need money as you say.  But here on Steam, this is not what early access is for.  Here I am and will request an immediate refund, which is exactly what everyone should do when a game is launched this early in development on Steam instead of giving positive BS reviews based on nothing but blind faith alone.","December 2, 2015","false","1.3"," 65 of 153 people (42%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","42","65","153","12","40"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bedoune/recommended/376210/","Bedoune","Bedood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bedoune/","65 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMy first review of the game was negative, because I hadn't poured enough playtime in it. Now that I have more than 200hrs in the game, I think I might be more able to write a decent review.\n\nSo, first of all, that game is in early access, that's why my review is totally assumed as a "temporary" review, that may change with time. Everything that I might say in there is related to the game in it's 0.89 version.\n\nPros :\n-A dev team clearly involved in its project, doing livestreams and stuff to stay close to the community.\n-Beautiful textures, for the environments and the Dinos, knowing that the 3D models could be worth thousands dollars each is pretty astonishing.\n-Realism is a keyword for that game\n-No abused balancing, no OP-Rex.\n\nCons :\n-A dev team that likes to keep mystery about future patches. You don't know what'll be next.\n-Irregular patch parutions, you can wait 2 days before having a huge patch, and you can also wait months before seeing something that have been announced a while ago (Quetzalcoatlus, that is even in the storepage screens, but not in game, despite it have been announced since 0.24 patch, something like that).\n-A community populated by children. That game should be available for 18+ only, that's horrible seeing kids everywhere, on community forums or even ingame :\n-Cancerous behaviours ingame : Kids that kills everything on sight because they're a mighty rex; other carnivores that threathen you if you try to eat their herb friend.... I agree that every player can have his playstyle, but some of them are simply ruining the fun for others.\n-Some basic issues reported by the community, but not being worked on by the dev team. I take for exemple the recent issues about ghost trees, or even the balance problem of Therizinosaurus.\n\nTo conclude, seeing that the majority of negative points aren't directly linked to the dev team or the game directly, I give a 7/10 to the game for it's brilliant efforts. And also for JP nostalgia.","January 30","true","250.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
