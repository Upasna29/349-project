Unique gameplay, nice graphics and beautiful music are the core elements of it. You won't regret.","May 10","true","2.8"," 49 of 61 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","49","61","2","2"

Assuming, that is, that there are some updates coming soon.\n\nIt's nicely fast paced with some interesting mechanics that are simple enough to pick up quickly. The game does feel very impersonal though. Aside from some vague instructions, there's a complete lack of in-game chat, and the kill feed just shows two columns of unnamed avatars. It would also be nice if there was a clearer indicator of when I'd died. A number of times I've found myself trying to control a similar looking character standing next to my corpse.\n\nDespite the game promoting a team-based experience, the most fun I've had so far was in a 1v1 game. The maps are very small, and having just a few more players can be enough to make it hard to see what's going on, but having just one opponent and no teammates allowed me to utilise the full map and actually become more involved in what I was doing.\n\nOh yeah, and bugs.\nThe first I encountered left my respawn invulnerability animation repeating for the rest of the game, leaving me able to kill and be killed, but not able to pick up the coins needed to win the match.\nThe second bug I found actually rendered me completely invulnerable. This grew boring however, as soon as I realised I was unable to attack either.\n\nIt's definitely a good game. The thing I want added most right now in it is just some more content.","May 11","true","4.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","2"

Online lobbies are pretty much empty so I can't stress enough, if you have friends to play this game, whether local or online, its a MUST HAVE. If you dont have people to play with, I suggest you wait till the price drops a bit, because it is an extremely easy to grasp fun game but the lack of bots makes it heavily reliant on other people.","May 29","true","1.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Mechanics are simple, although controls take some time to get used to and to master (I'm still learning), There is a decent amount of maps and modes to play, the graphics are nice and the music is pleasing to the ears. It lacks single player mode though and there aren't that many players online so far so if you don't have friends who also own this game you need to reconsider buying this game. Also, since there are no categories for players you may end up against a true master and be slaughtered. Still I recommend trying this game because it is fun, just be sure to not reach 2h limit in case you think it's not your cup of tea.","May 12","true","0.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It can get pretty dynamic at times :) This game was the reason I bought a controller. Honestly I would recomend it for anyone who doesn't have the time to immerse themselves into a story-driven game.\n\nIn conclusion:\nAwesome game for a quick stress relief :)","May 27","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RollforAwesome/recommended/425150/","RollforAwesome","Krizzleybear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RollforAwesome/","267 products in account","I have only played this with a controller, with a few friends locally, and a few randoms online, but man is it fun!\n\nI think the way the theme alludes to Assassins Creed is really well done, and overall holds together well.\n\nIt almost feels like a hardcore party game, and whatever button you press to jump, that finger is going to get a workout.\n\nYou need to jump to attack. If you land too early, you're probably dead. If you jump too far, you're probably dead. You control where you land by whether or not you are still holding jump, which means you can get tricky 'falling' through the building or stopping suddenly.\n\nIt definitely takes some getting used to, and the in-game instructions could be a bit clearer. But the most crucial thing is that it is fun to learn.\n\nAlso, it is great that if the game is public, people can join mid game - it means if you have enough local players or online friends, you're not waiting around in a lobby for more people.\n- although at the moment, there aren't so many players. I'm not sure if regions effect anything, but I'm playing from Australia.\n\nThe only thing left this game needs is a community of at least casual players. So come join us!","May 23","true","2.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The pace of the game is really different between 1v1 and 4v4 - some game modes in the latter case turn into real bloodsheds. It's a pity there are too few players to play online, because I'd definitely like to spend more time jumping and slashing. Thankfully there's also a couch co-op.\n\nPROS:\n- easy to learn\n- great music\n- beautiful graphic\n- the controls are unique\n\nCONS:\n- the controls are unique\n- noone to play with online","May 23","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm controversial about this game.\n\nPROS:\n-Great music choice;\n-Quite an unique game;\n-Mostly skilled based, little RNG;\n-Game modes are fun.\n\nCONS:\n-VERY weird controls, jumping to the mouse, as an example, is not properly explained;\n-Combat feels... weird. Maybe it is an rng part, but getting kills or getting killed feels pretty odd in this game, same reason why I find that jumping = attack is weird. Would be better for the game to seperate it (and maybe disallowe attacking while jumping);\n-Maps are odd. Its 2.5D, you can move up/down, left/right and also front/back but on a game like this, it feels weird;\n-Few maps so far, can feel repetitive pretty fast.\n\nOverall i'd give this game a 4.7/10, has done some things right but needs a fundamental overhaul of the control and combat system, more maps are needed then it could easily turn into a 7.","May 11","false","1.5"," 17 of 44 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","17","44","0","2"
