I still have nightmares</>\nBut jokes aside. This is 7th legion. An old epic megagames rts which holds up because of 2 things - technotrash soundtrack , which is kinda awesome (at least half of it), and because there is ability to play 'cards' from hand right on the battlefield applying buffs, debuffs, dealing direct damage and/or summoning reinforcements, like you playing some sort of ccg. That and the fact that you don't mine resources - you kill enemy, more enemies you kill - more resources you get based on timer+there are random missions right on the battlefield like 'kill 4 enemy turrets, reward 40k cr'.\n\nIt appears that game were patched, units does not stuck as much as in original version and it crashed only once before launching on win 7 64-bit. However. Rest of the bugs is still here and demands patching - main menu videos timing is still ♥♥♥♥ed, Pathfinding although partially better, still makes units stuck. That and lack of hi-res support, which is, especially with large onscreen unit size, is 'buolz' for the lack of better word.\n\n","October 24, 2014","true","0.2"," 42 of 56 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","42","56","4","3"

If you liked it then, you'll like it now. No fresh coat of paint, no additional features, nothing. For better or worse, it is exactly as it was.\n\nFor the uninitiated, 7th Legion is an RTS about two factions, the 7th Legion and the Chosen. The Chosen are comprised of the rich, powerful, and uber smart that evacuated Earth when pollution rendered the planet uninhabitable. The 7th Legion are so-called because they were the ones left behind, and this is the seventh generation after the evacuation. The Chosen come back from deep space to reclaim the planet, the 7th Legion resists, and that's about it. There's no real story beyond the intro video.\n\nAs far as play styles go, the infantry are mirrored on both sides. It's in the vehicles and Assault Chassis (mechs) that the two factions diverge. The 7th Legion has hard-hitting vehicles, and The Chosen have awesome AC's.\n\nThe game's economy is gifted in regular intervals of time. The player's rank will determine how many Credits are given during these intervals. Rank is achieved through a hidden XP system. Killing units, completing objectives, and destroying buildings all contribute. Credits can also be earned in the same fashion plus some additional means such as collecting crates and from "card" effects (more on that below).\n\nThe game has a unique system that adds an additional layer of strategy, playing cards. These cards are gifted every other interval or found in crates and have a wide variety of effects. They can instantly grant soldiers, burn the enemy in an area, gain control of an enemy vehicle, or steal credits. These cards are outlined with colored borders to indicate how they should be played: green for play on yourself, blue for neutral, and red for play on the enemy. Exploiting these cards at the right time often will have devastating effects on your enemy. The enemy has their own cards that can be played on you, too, so be careful.\n\nThe game's missions are challenging, and maps are usually large enough to explore different routes. The 7th Legion's missions tend to be more strategic, expanding beyond merely amassing an army and steamrolling across the map. In one mission, you only have one guy with a bomb, and you have to blow up a base with it before you are granted reinforcements. There are a few others where you don't even have a base, and have to make do with small squads and limited resources.\n\nThere are also infantry based missions indoors. In these scenarios, three soldiers enter a facility to either get to a certain point on the map or kill everyone inside. Each member of the squad can be equipped with three weapon types, the default laser gun, grenade launcher, or a sniper rifle. Frankly though, the sniper rifle is vastly superior, and it's the only weapon I use. The game for either faction will last a handful of hours to complete.\n\nAlthough the game is a lot of fun, there are a number of caveats. It's far from perfect. Pathing in large groups is an exercise in frustration. Units will get stuck behind trees, on different elevations, or will ignore orders altogether. They do this thing I call the "F You" response. Say for example you want to attack a vehicle bay. Instead of doing that, sometimes tank turrets or AC chassis will spin 180 degrees and just sit there. Or just as bad, units sometimes won't recognize move and attack orders that are placed very near to the unit.\n\nThe enemy AI is about as intelligent as a pile of rocks. My favorite tactic is to wall off paths to my base,then build power plants or barracks until I can literally build well behind enemy lines. They never destroy the walls and only attack buildings that are invading their space once in a while. However, never is the AI's stupidity more evident than when playing a particular card, "Armageddon". It wipes out the whole map of friendlies and enemy alike, destroys every building, and critically damages both bases. No matter how intricately the mission map was planned out, the AI won't even repair the base. They build one or two power plants, barracks, basic infantry, and that's it. Left to its own devices, the AI is worthless.\n\nThis game was developed in a time where balance wasn't a huge factor, and patches were difficult to distribute. It is possible to upgrade infantry to the degree of being near-godlike. With top armor upgrades, some infantry can survive being crushed by tank treads quite handily. Sure, you can upgrade vehicle and AC armor and weapons, but upgrading infantry is much more economical and effective.\n\nIf you are willing to forgive the game's shortcomings, there's a lot to enjoy here. Some of the cut-scenes are pretty cool, and the title theme is still an awesome jam. The card system and how the economy works are both unique features that I haven't seen reproduced in any RTS since. For the price, give it a try. You only have a few bucks and an afternoon to lose.","October 24, 2014","true","15.3"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","22","29","2","0"

Sadly, his works always tend to end up in rather flawed games, and 7th Legion is no exception. The game's premise is great, though a bit too heavily influenced by Warhammer 40000, especially when it comes to unit designs.\nIt also has some pretty interesting mechanics, most importantly a card game system, which it probably was the first RTS games to have, even though we've seen it more recently (and better executed) in games like Divinity: Dragon Commander and Battleforge.\n7th Legion sadly has issues with many of the genre's fundamentals - path finding and mouse interface among the worst offenders, often making you struggle against the UI to get even basic stuff done (especially since modern CPU's are too fast to give you the intended delay from clicking to getting the unit behavior menu that's only supposed to appear after you've held the left mouse button for a second. You'll also notice the main menu animations going way too fast, but the in-game cutscenes work as intended).\nAll in all it's a pretty interesting title from the era when we saw the creative peak of the genre, it's a deeply\n\nflawed RTS, certainly not at the level of classics like Dark Reign or Total Annihilation, or even Krush Kill 'N Destroy but over all I think it's worth experiencing.","October 25, 2014","true","0.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

Use DXWnd instead which you can download from their sourceforge webpage. Once installed If you look in the DXWnd 'exports' folder you will find compatibility templates. Just pick a template for a similar DirectDraw game from that time period, unless you want to create your own. Make sure to change the path to your legion.exe and untick 'run in window' or choose resolution, etc.\n\nAs for the game, I would only recommend it for RTS veterans that played the original genre games like C&C, KKND, Dune, Warcraft, etc and are happy to play a game from that era. If you don't know what you are getting into then I would probably say don't bother and just play something more modern instead.\n\nFeatures;\nAction Card System that is used to change the dynamics of the battle.\nA.I. uses the Action Card System as well.\nUnits rank up with experience.\nEarn resources from destroying enemy units.\nCan put units into squads with [CTRL]+[1] or [CTRL]+[2] and then quick select with [1] or [2], etc.\nCan select all units in screen view by right clicking on a unit.\nRandom crate drops on battlefield.\nRandom events can occur throughout battle.\nFMV cutscenes between campaign missions.\nMusic is interesting if you don't mind electronical/industrial metal.\n\nCan only build one infantry or tank unit, etc at a time even if you have multiple barracks or factorys, etc.\nPathfinding can be a little annoying sometimes but is manageable if you keep things simple.\n\nThis is an old skool RTS game and therefore the mechanics are quite simple by modern standards. Basically, just build a large army as quick as you can and try to overpower the enemy. The randomness from the Action Card System, the drop crates, and the random events can be a blessing or a curse.","September 14, 2015","true","0.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Heavily underrated.  It's gameplay features many common RTS elements such as tech trees and base building mechanics. However, it also features so unique features. Its first unique setup is that instead of farming resources, you're killing enemies. This allows boosts to your periodical budget allotment, which gives you free money. With a much heavier emphasis on combat, its nice to throw aside your usual chains to resources and just mow down some Chosen scum. Its other unique mechanic is Cards. Just like your perodic budget allotment, every few cycles you'll get a unqiue card. These Cards all feature different effects. To illustrate, the Chaos card causes all characters within it's radius to start fighting each other, friend or foe. The Stealth card cloakcs your units, kaing them invisible, etc. This might sound like tacky gimmick, but this is a real game changer, these cards can easily turn the courses of battle.\nSo, unto my problems with this game. Firstly, THIS GAME IS UNOPTIMIZED. In order to play, download DXwind and look over the game's forums here on Steam to find more in-depth tuts. Also, there are two factions in-game: 7th Legion and the Chosen. The Chosen quit the Earth centuries ago when it ran out of resources, and left most of humanity behind. They returned later on, thinking humanity had died out, only to find several warring factions, whom all teamed up when they found the Chosen returning. So, now both sides are fighting for the Earth. I haven't beaten the campaign, but the story seems paper-thin and more just a backdrop than anything else. the two in game factions are just recolors of each other; one being red and the other blue. I don't believe there is any stat differences or unit alterrations.\nSo, to summerize, this game features some unqiue mechanics and an awesome soundtrack, only really held back by my nitpacks. However, the fact it is on Steam but not optimized at all for newer tech is practically heresy. It is disgusting to see them merely throw something on Steam with little reguards for the consumer, and force the consmer to work for hours trying to get their product to work. Consumers shouldn't have to waste time on trying to fix a product. That's the developer's job, if someone puts a game on Steam, even if its an older game, they need to patch it up. Period. Due to the nonexistant optimization, I must downvote this game. Should the publisher patch the game, I'll upvote it. In the mean time however, no.","September 21, 2015","false","4.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"
