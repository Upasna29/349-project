As a Unity user I can see this game was made 100% from untouched Unity Assets, seriously, they used THE SAME MONSTER ON THREE OF THEIR GAMES. (The big ogre monster which is featured on the Infamous "Slaughtering Grounds" and on "Deadly Profits")\n\nThe "devs" (If you can call them like that) are the most immature and childish people on Steam, banning people on the forums and insulting critics of their game. (And lets not even talk about the Copyright strike to Jim Sterling for making what they thought was an "unfair" critic about their game... yes, these people believe you can Strike someone with copyright if you dont like their review of your product.)\n\nSo im sorry, but I will be refunding the game since I dont wanna give these people my money to support more terrible games like these.\n\nThank god for Steam refunds and freedom of speech.","July 2, 2015","false","0.3"," 479 of 495 people (97%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","97","479","495","20","5"

I must say, that's not the worst from those 5 games, but it is still far from being acceptable.\n\nAll the same stuff:\n- freezes at every screen\n- can't be really tuned to fit PC standards\n- offers mindless grinding gameplay, where you don't need any synapses, just mashing one button all the round\n\nIt is not a good way to spend your precious free time, believe me.

That was less than a year ago!\n\nJust like their other games (The Slaughtering Grounds, Forsaken Uprising, Deadly Profits, Temper Tantrum) Medieval Mercs is nothing else but an undeveloped concept with premade assets lazily thrown in the Unity engine.  As a dwarf, you start in a little map and you kill enemies thrown at you until you raise your rank. This will simply unlock other characters and difficulty modes. A game usually last no more than 2 minutes and things get repetitive really fast as you restart and grind XP to level up. After 10 minutes you will see everything the game has to offer.\n\nOverall, playing Medieval Mercs is like watching the game trailer ten times in a row.\n\nDear Robert aka Digital Homicide Studios/Imminent Uprising,\n\nBeing an indie developers is not an excuse for making five bad games in a row. And I'm not blaming that on the fact that you're an indie developer. Big companies can make bad games too, did you know that? Also, I can name many good quality indie games in the market that got a lot of praise :\n\n-Ziggurat\n-Eldritch\n-Tower of Guns\n-The Vanishing of Ethan Carter\n-Amnesia : The Dark Descent\n-DreadOut\n-Outlast\n-Hero Siege\n-Hammerwatch\n-Ori and the Blind Forest\n-Guacamelee\n-Heavy Bullet\n-The Binding of Isaac\n-Delver\n-Path of Exile\n-Torchlight\n-Five Night at Freddy\n\nSee? You got no excuse... That said, you just won the Uwe Boll of video games title.\n\nSince I paid for your "product", I am entitled to my opinion. Am I right?

There isn't that much to say about medieval mercs. You don't know what to do and then you die because the game gives you NO INSTRUCTIONS WHAT SO EVER! When I died I didn't even know what happened. When I died it took me to the menu which like the menus in deadly profits were confusing as hell. speaking of deadly profits this game reuses alot of things from deadly profits: theenemies, the menus, the sound effects, the music even the mouse cursor is the same.\n\nYou play as a viking warrior trying to defend his village from deadly profits enemies. there are just constant enemies thrown at you with no rhyme or reason and you die rinse and repeat I don't think it's possible for someone to beat the first level if someone has please send me video proof because I don't think it's possible\n\nBecause I haven't gotten past the first there isn't much else to say\n\nPros\n+Can you think of some cause I can't\n\nCons\n-Reused deadly profits everything\n-bad controls\n-hard even on easy\n-1st level's impossible\n-Bad menus\n\nThe best way to describe this is to quote digita homicide on this game over screen from medieval mercs\n\n"The gates are down the village is pillaged your reputation will be damaged from this defeat!"

Their business model is shoveling these flipped-asset games onto the Steam store for cheap--or alternatively inserting them all into a bundle--and then profiting off the cards.  No effort.

The game itself has actually put a lot of things in my mind as a developer that I never really thought about when building games, that one tends to overlook. (Not all of the below fall into that category)\n\n-Menu Madness:\nThe menu that one is thrown into after the titlescreen is a complete mess. It combines serval mechanics on one screen and fails to arrange them in any meaningful way. The font on the menus is unpleasant and too small to read comfortably. (Especially the stats in the crafting area, I still can't tell if some items have +/- stats or if that is even a mechanic in this game). Oddly enough, the tooltips use an even worse font.\n\n-Crafting? Because why...?\nI have yet to see any discrenable reason that the dev added crafting into this game. In games such as Minecraft, the need to gathr materials encouraged the player to explore and made it so that even if you don't find what you are looking for during an expidition, you may still collect other resources you can use for vanity. This War of Mine used the concentration of resource drops in certain locations to create player choice, where the player may need to choose between scavenging for medicine to heal a wounded member, or food for their party. In this game crafting materials drop with no rhyme or reason and at every level of difficulty with no percieved change in frequency. Additionally, all armour of a certain armour class requires exactly the same resources to craft. The crafting system could have been cut out entirely and replaced with a gold system. At least that way I could do something useless items like sell them, rather than having to destory meaterials because I have 5 peices but only need 1 to create a weapon.\n\n-Boss Drops are Mundane:\nAnother problem is that the bosses in the game don't drop anything out of the ordinary. They seem to drop exactly one resource material upon death, which is meaningless because you are almost 100% gauranteed to get at least 3 materials from random drops anyway. This doesn't give the player a sense of accomplishment.\n\n-Little variation in Enemies:\nYes, while there are a ton of cosmetic differences, there are only 3 types of enemy: Melee, Spell-casting and Bosses. Even though all the enemies look different, they still die in 1 or 2 hits even on maximum difficulty and this makes them all feel the same. There is no percievable difference in hit-points, move speed or damage of enemies.\n\n-Lack of a Story/Lore:\nThis game aso suffers from even a basic plot which would probably improve the quality dramatically and shouldn't even be that difficult to implement. This is one of those games that I would probably play just to see what happens in the plot or discover some new enemy models (which the dev has tons of). They are really failing to exploit their advantage in the market here where they actually do have the ability to produce massive amounts of cosmetic content. Even though they already litter the assets around their games with little cohesion (okay, they did the background cohesively, so they are getting better), they don't captialise on the story they could tell with those cosmetics.\n\n-No Explanantion of Stats:\nWhile on may assume Attack increases damage, what do Critical and Endurance do? I couldn't find any explanation of this or even the formula for how it worked. It may very well be buried in the discussions somewhere but I shoundl't have to go looking there to play the game. It should be with th product it is relevant to.\n\n-Cop-out Tutorial:\nThe tutorial that the game has is a menu hidden in the menu which pops up when one hits the Escape key. It looks like it was tacked on at the end instead of built-in as  level from the beginning like it should have been.\n\n-Coin System?...again why?\nThe Coin system that appears at the top of the screen alos looks like it was tacked on at the end, with no names or tooltips for the abilities listed and font so tiny you can barely make out how much it each on costs. Again, while the skull was intuitive, what does the leaf mean? I never really used the coins, although I found it extremely amusing that the one killing all foes on the screen, also insta-kills bosses.\n\n-In Game UI Poorly Designed:\nThe in-game UI takes up half of the screen and this too seems to be for no real reason. The player can see everything in their inventory (taking up a massive amount of screen space), but their inventory really isn't as important as the monsters that they are fighting, of the environment they are fighting in, which could have been more heavily featured if the useless UI wasn't there. While you can interact with items in the inventory like normal, why would you want to? None of them heal you and it isn't like the items have huge state differences that make a difference in gameplay at all. The player health is also tiny and hard to locate quickly in a fight. The option to level up is also constantly available during a fight, which is also pretty useless because you never have much of  a break to level up anyway.\n\n-Wildly Unbalanced Everything:\nThe player is way too powerful in this game and only has to strafe left and right clicking the mouse to win. After level 3 there is no reason to use abilities as it seems almost impossible to die. Monsters drop health often enough that you don't ahve to worry. Also the starting class can heal himself and you can purchase healing with the coins if you can be bothered to click the button at the top of the screen. This game really needs a lot more playtesting to balance properly and actually make it a challenge or even require some thought to play. There is potential for it to be interesting if the devs will just take the time to balance their mechanics to support different playstyles.\n\nAnd there you have it, a good specimine worth analyzing to learn bad ways of doing things. I hope that one day I can remove this review because none of the above still apply, but until then- you should definitely give the game at least a chance, I had a laught or two (not in the good way) while playing, so it is amusing; but not fun.","July 7, 2015","true","4.4"," 82 of 158 people (52%) found this review helpful 53 people found this review funny","52","82","158","53","1"

After playing the game, He is now the single person that i hate the most. May his family suffr the force of a thousand suns in the eternal torment of what is known as hell. Ergo, this game.\n\nI downloaded it and started playing it. After exactly one minute of gameplay, it crashed. I tried again, thinking it was just 1 faulty event. Sadly i was wrong. The game starts off by throwing you right into the game, no tutorial what so ever.  After a short time, i died. I arrived to a lvl up menu. Which was very messy.\n\nThe overall game is terrible, there are multible flash games that are far supiriour to this pile of excrement. I would only wish to bring this torture to the one taht gifted me this broken, terrible, vile, and horrible game which was never ment to exist in the first place. May the heavens reign havoc on the game developers, and the person that gifted me this game.\n","September 8, 2015","true","0.2"," 17 of 38 people (45%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","45","17","38","16","0"

It was fun and entertaining with lots of eye candy, showie magic and an eye popping main hub/screen in witch there is a lot of things going on.  The music was something out of the Renaissance Fair or Medieval Times. The game itself, is you get to chose between a defender dwarf, ranger human or mage human and defend the gates of a chosen town/hoval from all sorts of creatures you can think of that go bump in the night ( and then some).  There are bosses that do sneak up at the end of the level and are pretty cool to see ...but die fast. With basic moves for each merc and an equipment build that doesnt take long to get a full set of gear the game is relitively just that. Simple. Witch is't bad, but isnt something id return to for hours of game play. Defend and win games to gain ranks to open up harder levels and merc's.
