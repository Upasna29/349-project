Get a HDMI cable, a tv and some controllers to get the most enjoyment out of it. The modes are 1v1 and 2v2, so it doesnt support odd numbers of players.\n\nSportsfriends offers a suit of games - all of which would be worth buying in their own right.\n\nBaraBariBall is a volleyball/platform fighter hybrid. You score points by having the ball sink in the water on your color coded side of the screen. Points are lost when you yourself die. Your fighters can ahve a maximum of 7 spirit balls floating around them, which quickly regenerate when on the ground. One ball is consumed with each jump, and they can also be used for power throws or power attacks.\n\nSuper pole riders has a ball on a rope with two goals at either end. Each player is given a pole vaulting pole - the pole can be used to hit the ball slightly, propel yourself for a powerfull kick, block other players from moving, or jumping on their heads to kill them (they respawn shortly afterwards). This game is crazy fun and often when under pressure you may spin the joystick in the wrong direction, propelling you the wrong way.\n\nHokra is the weaker of the gamess. It is essentially a hokey game that has been done many times before.\n\nJohann Sebastian Joust is not available on the PC so I am unable to provide comments.\n\nSubscribe to my curator page for more local multiplayer recommendations: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7189360/\n\nCheck out my Couch Gaming group for specials, bundles, etc: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CGLM","March 19, 2015","true","1.7"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","0"

It dwindles to only 2 out of 4 if you have anything less than 4 players.\n\nThe biggest problem with this is the lack of 3 player support. Its either 2 or 4, and nothing in between.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zero51/recommended/277850/","zero51","zerofiftyone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zero51/","365 products in account","An amazing collection of local multiplayer games. I've been playing these games with friends and at public events for over a year and they're a crowd favourite every time. Each of the games is easy enough to pick up from watching a match or two but are deceptively complex and very competitive. JS Joust has some unusual requirements in order to play (2-7 PS Move controllers and a large-ish room to play in), but the effort is definately worth it. Joust is the most memorable and universally enjoyable party game I've ever hosted.  Even the two secret games are hilarious fun once you figure out how to unlock them (you'll have to figure this one out by yourself).","December 19, 2014","true","12.9"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Each game has very little learning overhead, is fun to watch, and is over quickly enough that your other friends can rotate in.\n\nAnd yes, the killer app here is Joust. If you love throwing parties, and are friends with people who aren't as into games as you, I can 100% recommend from experience navigating over to eBay, taking the plunge and buying 8 Move controllers. It cost me about $100, but make the next two parties you throw BYOB and you'll be back in the black with leftover booze.\n\nThere is, however, ONE MAJOR ISSUE: no Windows support for Move controllers! As a Kickstarter backer I've been following development, and it looks the devs have been doing literally everything in their power to get this to work, but no dice â€“ they even spoke to an MS engineer who told them it was impossible to do. Still, if you're going to put in the effort to get those Move controllers, might as well go the extra mile and install Ubuntu on your machine. Problem solved!\n\nAlso, the other games all work wirelessly with up to four PS4 controllers! I haven't tried any other controllers, but I can definitely confirm Dualshock 4 functionality.","December 19, 2014","true","1.9"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"
