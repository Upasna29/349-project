The original and it's expansion are classics but I prefer #3\n\nTropico #3\n\nPros-\n\n#1.Good Graphics\n\n#2.Many Buildings to build\n\n#3.Custom El Presidente\n\n#4.Rebels will fight you if you don't please your people\n\n#5.Some good music\n\n#6.The radio guy can be helpful and funny\n\n\n\nCons-\n\n#1.Building buildings gets old\n\n#2.The roads are too big\n\n#3.You can't make roads anywhere on the map.You would think you could get a bulldozer or dynamite and have enough slaves I mean your people lol to lower/raise/flatten any land you want.Not being able to connect all the roads sucks\n\n#4.It is really easy to beat the rebels once you learn how to play\n\n#5.One of the songs in the game I don't like it and they don't allow us to control what song is played.I just mute the music for a few minutes and then turn it back on.They could of added more songs also\n\n#6.The radio guy gets really repetitive and I'm sure some can't stand him.I can tolerate him for awhile but I get sick of him too\n\n#7.The maps are so small and it makes putting the tourists buildings in a area they can all fit and is allowed a serious problem.You can't place the buildings anywhere or less people will go to them.It would be like telling you to stay at a hotel in the ghetto part of the island.Some tourists just wont do it.That is realistic but the maps are so small.If they fix this the roads can remain big\n\n#8.The majority of edits you never ever use.A few are good but most of them there is no reason to do them\n\n#9.USA and USSR will circle your waters if you don't do something better.You will just lose if you don't fix it.If I am going to lose come on my island and shoot it out with me and my soldiers then\n\n#10.I don't think the cops do anything.I saw they drive around and arrest people when you tell them to.I don't know if it lowers crime rates but if you are playing to help your people you wont need cops\n\n#11.Prisons are even less needed.Unless you are going to act evil you wont need a prison for sure.I never saw a cop arrest anyone unless I told them to\n\n\nThe Bottom Line -\n\nTropico 3 is a fun game that will let you create your own city.I found the rebels first attack on me to be a wtf moment.It was funny and cool.I would also call that realistic.Once I got the hang of it I could make my people happy and defend myself and make plenty of money\n\nI played as an evil El Presidente and it was ok but I could kill anyone that wasn't related to the military or cops/prison officers and get away with it.The rebels couldn't beat me because I treated the military so much better than everyone else and I always had an army.I never killed the wives of my soldiers and I wonder what happens then.I doubt it would of mattered I could just replace them.I found it less fun to act evil because they can't beat you once you have the military setup the right way\n\nOnce you are making good money the game gets really boring.I would of liked it had I been able to make a full military.Have buildings create Tanks,Fighter Jets ect and prepare for war.Then after that conquer another island or be invaded by a country that was a more even fight.I don't mean fight the USA or USSR but a similar country.It would of made a multiplayer game really fun\n\nTropico 4 could have 2 settings\n\n#1 Financial\n\nAll it is about is building and money and they remove the rebels.This is great for kids and people who don't even like the rebels killing you or you killing them\n\n#2 Financial and War\n\nYou have the same buildings as #1 but also weapons buildings and navy/air force/army/marines related buildings.The rebels would be there but the rebels would create and/or even take over your buildings.Make them tougher with more tactics.Plus the objective of the game is to stay in control of your own island which would be harder and then take over other islands.Then you got the multiplayer version\n\nThis would create not only a better game but it would appeal to more people.I hope Tropico 4 looks something like this as I have not played it yet but if it doesn't I hope Tropico 5 does.\n\nMy 2 cents\n\nDan","June 29, 2014","true","16.0"," 114 of 120 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","114","120","0","0"

While you don't have as many options of creation and aren't really in battle with any other nation as you would in Civilization games, you're faced with a much different, and in my opinion player-friendly playstyle.\n\nYou're essentially in control of an island. As "El Presidente", you're given the options of running said island however you wish. Want to be an industry titan, producing oil, cigars and rum in mass quantity to make your city prosper? Or will you make the island a "paradise" and profit off tourists in hotels? The choice is yours.\n\nWell, ish. The industry option MASSIVELY overpowers tourism in revenue, and also is better of when you focus on just one type of product. However, the game is still quite fun and the possibilites endless.\n\nThe events and occur in the campaign are interesting and add a twist to your gameplay, which by the way, is still themed as you being a dictator on an island. The said island has different interest groups, and some are more powerful than others. You may  wish to build a church over a factory if elections are close and the religious group is upset. Or maybe even an army base, lest you wish your own generals and soldiers turn on you.\n\nThe way you control these groups is up to you. Do you praise democracy and have free elections? Or do you declare martial law and shoot any protesters on sight? The choice is yours, Presidente.\n\nI got this game through a Humble Bundle, and do not regret the purchase.","August 7, 2014","true","21.3"," 55 of 57 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","55","57","0","0"

There was a lot of houses being built, tenements, apartments, country houses and farms. Our island OIPKWQGIJWGPIYOLOSWAGVILLE was getting circled around by American gunships.

It features funny and charming music, atmosphere, and little details that continue to make me smile. The varieties of different approaches you can take to building an economy or satisfying your people are great, and the balance between diplomacy, economics, and and politics is very good. My major complaints with this game are that many game mechanics are not explained at all (very poor tutorial) and the ways things effect each other are not readily apparent in many situations. When first playing the game, youll often find your economy suddenly tanking, and youll have to dig through the economy hunting for clues as to why it is doing so. The constant effect of each building and policy should be more visible immediately within the UI, in order to avoid situations where the player doesn't understand the causes of an event. Also, the AI needs a lot of work, and the garage and combat systems are very flawed. Overall, I'm excited to see where they take it.","December 31, 2013","true","27.9"," 39 of 41 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","39","41","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/23490/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","City building games have been a staple of PC gaming since the beginning. It is a subset of the RTS genre that helped to pioneer both sandbox gameplay and the concept of nearly limitless replayability. Fastforward to the present and the genre remains very much alive and well in Tropico 3; a game that takes the foundation of the genre, adds a great deal of social and economic depth, and finally puts a Latin twist on it for good measure. Developed by Haemimont Games and published by Kalypso Media, Tropico 3 has all the features of a city-building game developed by the mainstream likes of Electronic Arts.\n\nThe first thing that will grab your attention is the visual quality. Tropico 3 brings the beauty of tropical islands to life very similar to the way Far Cry did. From lush forests to arid deserts, the varying environments on a single island help to break up any visual monotony that would normally be a problem. Of course, this isn't to say that the random map generator can't and doesn't create maps with little variation. Thankfully, the game does allow you to preview the landscape before starting on a new island.\n\nIf the visuals aren't impressive enough, the soundtrack will get certainly get your attention. The music attempts to capture the authentic Caribbean style and does a fairly good job of it. In fact, the only real downside to the soundtrack is that there doesn't seem to be enough tracks. You will hear the same tracks many, many times during one game, which can last for hours depending on whether you're playing in sandbox mode or a campaign.\n\nIn order to maintain the game's authenticity, the majority of the voice acting is Spanish. Moreover, any immigrants or workers hired from other countries will mostly speak English. Only the voice acting that the player needs to understand is done in English with a decent Latin American accent. For example, there is a radio announcer that provides regular updates on the situation of the island.\n\nThe gameplay isn't the standard city building players have come to expect from games like Sim City. Instead, Tropico 3's focus is on the social, political, and economic development of the island nation. The game introduces a few factions that the people align themselves with such as Capitalists, Communists, Nationalists, Militarists, Environmentalists, Intellectuals, and the Religious. And, the player is tasked with appeasing these factions whether by building structures such as churches or military bases, signing edicts that reduce pollution or ban contraceptives, or signing treaties with either the U.S. or the U.S.S.R.\n\nThe faction system brings a lot of depth to Tropico 3, and it isn't just about increasing the happiness of the overall population. Every couple years an election is held on the island that the player must win. Appeasing a majority of the factions helps secure votes, but it's based on more than making all the factions happy. For example, a majority of the population may belong to a single faction, thus making that faction the most important focus. Knowing which factions to appease and when is crucial to getting reelected. The player can choose to give political speeches during each election, and even pick what topics to address, which can have an effect on the voters.\n\nThe elections aren't the only thing to worry about it. There is also the potential for members of a faction to become rebels. If the player makes a faction angry enough, it will increase the number of rebels. Then, those rebels will attempt to sabotage infrastructure, take hostages, spread propaganda, and even assassinate El Presidente. Of course, being in good standing with the Militarists (the army) allows the player to fend off against rebel attacks, which even play out on the streets when they occur.\n\nEconomically, Tropico 3 is based entirely around three major sources of revenue: industry, agriculture, and tourism. The player can use farms, which can be set to harvest a variety of crops from food to tobacco; industrial buildings, which take those crops and produce products; and/or tourism attractions, which bring people to the island who will spend money.\n\nBased on the map the player is given, some economic resources such as oil wells and mining deposits, may not be available, forcing the player to rely on other ways of growing the economy. Economic progression in Tropico 3 is a slow process, even using the 3x speed feature that's available. Moreover, it needs to be closely watched by the player because of random events that may occur. For example, throughout the game, the state of the world economy may fluctuate, causing an increase or decrease in the price of your exported goods. These events will impact the player's economy dramatically, forcing the player to take action.\n\nTropico 3 doesn't offer a huge number of building variations or options like many city building games do, but it doesn't need to. The depth of the game doesn't stem from the cosmetic look of the buildings, but from the dizzying level of depth and customization. For example, all the farms look exactly the same, but the player can set each farm on the island to grow a different crop. Better yet, where the farm is placed affects what types of crops it can grow. Some crops grow best at high altitudes, in high humidity, or in sunny areas. Picking the right crop for the right location can make or break your economy.\n\nTo add to the depth, the player can also set the wages of the workers based on the job or education level. Even better than that, players can set wages based on each individual building. For instance, the cooks at one restaurant could make $15 while the cooks at the restaurant close to the tourist's hotel could make $20. Players are also able to easily set the wages of all the cooks, regardless of which restaurant they work at, as simply as clicking a button. The same thing goes for the education level options, which allow the player to set the wage of all employees with no education, a high school education, or a college education.\n\nPlayer will have to deal with a variety of problems such as pollution, economic disparity, crime, housing, political unrest, foreign influence, overcrowding, extreme weather, and a variety of random events that can impact the island. Hurricanes can sweep in and destroy key buildings such as electric substations, which could create rolling blackouts across the island, reducing the output of industry buildings that require power and lowering the overall happiness of the population.\n\nDespite the game's astounding level of depth and options, however, there are a few problems that can cause headaches. For starters, the in-game tutorial is a less-than-adequate introduction to the game mechanics. It does a fine job of getting the player used to the UI and where certain information is represented, but it doesn't explain how to actually grow the economy or reduce the threat of rebellion. For example, the tutorial will tell the player how to build a farm and set a crop, but it doesn't make it clear how exactly it contributes to increasing revenue.\n\nThere are also some minor control issues. For example, when selecting a building to place on the map, the player uses the middle scroll wheel to rotate the buildings orientation. However, the scroll wheel is also used to zoom in and out, which means the player needs to zoom in close enough prior to selecting a building to ensure the placement is correct.\n\nOverall, Tropico 3 should be applauded for its depth and customization. The game's visuals along with its unique and authentic soundtrack help draw the player into its Caribbean setting. And, regardless of its few problems, none of which are game-breaking, it does an excellent job of focusing on the political, social, and economic pieces of the game, each of which often affects the others in some way.","April 10","true","66.2"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","21","21","0","0"

Although this version (Tropico 3) doesn't offer a really improved experience compared to the first one of the saga, besides some graphical improvement and a more 3D environment.\nAs the commander of a banana republic, this game offers a different feeling from other city government simulations you've may tried. This one is really political and you'll often have to choose between communist/capitalist ways to rule a nation. You are going to try to make your Tropico nation a wealthy one, but of course, not forgetting about your own Swiss Account.\nThe sound of this game is one of the things I like most. Of course, I speak spanish and I like latin music, but besides that, background music mixes within the sense of a Tropican country, and your people dialogs are so much fun, it really is one of the things I'd recommend Tropico for.\nThe sense of humour of this saga, and the entire parody thing is one of its strongest's points, if you're unfamiliar with Tropico games, I'd recommend you to start with Tropico 1, or Tropico 4.

I got this free from Humble Bundle and I have found it incredibly enjoyable, sometimes too easy and also slightly frustrating at times but on the whole fun.\n\nThe scenario you're placed in is a fantastic idea (small banana republic torn between capitalism and communism) and gives your small towns a personal feel rather than just a mass of housing in a giant metropolis. Essentially you're a poor nation building up a small island to become a global success through tourism or commerce. Your main aim in the game is to please these sims and you can view each one and what they're upto by clicking on them or completely ignore them and play the game like you would simcity, the choice is yours.\n\nI will also try the new games of the series.

You guide civilization on the island down multiple paths based on playstyle and choices you make leading to a variety of different cultures taking hold in your society. Does your nation become a capitalist industrial powerhouse? A (not so) peaceful theocracy? Maybe you give rise to a Communist paradise! Its pretty much all up to you in Tropico. Can you lead your nation to success, or will you end up a failed state?\n\n\nOverall I would give the Tropico games a recommendation if you are a fan of sim games. That being said, even if you are new to the genre, there is a very good chance Tropico 3 SSE could make a great addition to your library.","September 22, 2015","true","8.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It has great voice actors that make the expirence entertaining and keep you sitting in your chair for hours. The game is very involving and very well done.

And I'm aware that this game exist for years now, but I didn't get a chance to try this because I was not so interested in this game back then, or maybe I just don't know how good it was and what are the mechanics that made this game unique to other RTS out there.\n\nMy attitude with RTS games back in the day was, if it's not Liquid Ent., Blizzard or EA's RTS work like Battle Realms, Red Alert, Generals, Warcraft etc. then I won't try play it.\n\nBut when Valve and publisher behind this game decided to release and give away free Keys for 24 hours, I didn't hesitate to get one and DL this game immediately and play it. And yes I was suprised how good this game is, its very well made and you will definitely enjoy this.\n\nWhat I like about this game so far:\n\n- You will get a chance to run a country like 'Tropico'\n- You will also get a chance to become a dictator/Leader like Fidel Castro in virtual world.\n- Manage all the resources and aid given by US or USSR and build structures to grow Tropico's economy.\n- Deal with all the rebels who's planning to destabilise your leadership. lol\n- Yeah, the graphics are dated or outdated (whatever you call it) but it won't stop you for enjoying it.\n- The game's real time AI reactions are really good enough. There are protest, rebellions, International Community reactions, war and even budget deficits that could make your economy down from debts if you build a lot of projects simultaneously.\n\nAnd lastly, I have a suggestion for the devs of this game since this is (old?) and the graphics are no longer acceptable in the standard of this generation. Why don't they port this game on modern powerful Smartphones and Tablets that have Quad core CPUs and GPUs? I think that this game is very ideal for Touch screen devices since this is purely RTS and doesn't require much of buttons to play.. And to end this review, I will definitely recommend this game to anyone, even on Aliens living on Mars.","October 17, 2014","true","4.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There is nothing wrong with it in a sense of quality and features...It's just...It's kind of dry. I can't quite put my finger on it. But all I know is that I don't enjoy my time playing this. It's just bland. Here's a good way to put it. It's like a rice cake. Very dry and no flavor. But this is a special rice cake, it has that extremely sweet white frosting dazzled on the top of it. So in a way it's good, but it's still a rice cake. See what I'm getting at.\nAlso the game is sold as a city builder, but I'm not feeling that strategy side that all city builders are supposed to have. It's to easy to win this game. Also there are no real penalties to the bad decisions you make in the game. So again, it's a rice cake.\n\nNow I'm jumping to the things that I really just don't like about the game. So no more rice metaphors.\nFirst of all the road building.....Oh my sweet goodness me. It is supremely dimwitted. It just doesn't listen to what I want it to do! I try to do grids, I get squiggles. I want to do squiggles, I get a grid. It's just bad.\nAnother thing, the builders.............JUST BUILD THE FRIKKIN FARM! IT'S BEEN 2 YEARS! JUST BUILD IT! It gives you an option to speed up the building process by prioritizing the things you want done. But all that does is gets one builders attention for 3 seconds.  So everything you want to get built, doesn't get built and everyone gets angry, and you lose....*sigh*\nThere's another thing. Stop telling me to build garages! I have enough!\nAnd lastly. The radio......... I want to tie up Juanito, set him in a boat....made of meat, drench the entire thing in gasoline, shove it toward a shark with a match strapped to it's nose, and then do the same thing to his set of records that consist of only 5 songs. I hate Juanito!...........RICE CAKE! (I lied)\n\nOk now that my anger has been taken out. Let me tell you what you need to do if you want to build a city in a video game and pretend your a crazed dictator from South America.........Buy Cities: Skylines, and use your imagination.

It does well enough to fit the atmosphere of the title with radio broadcasts, spanish accents and the lavitan background music. As "El Presidente" you must get enough votes to remain in power which makes it sometimes satisfying to win the election after some hard citizens to win over, however not much else is done to deepen the voting system in the game. Once you lose an election it is game over, If you win you may continue on until the next election rinse and repeat. You are a leader of a small island nation that seems to be soverign in it's own right, owing no alleginace to any superpower.\nYou can however do dealings with Russia or America, building favour with the Communists or Capitalists, respectivly.\n\nIt boils down to how you would like to run your nation, (in each mission or map scenario) leaning towards communism, keeps your citizens happier and housing cheaper, albiet loss of export profits. If heading towards the Capitalist end of the spectrum, favoring infastructure, power plants and of course export profits. As an island nation, the economy relies on exports whether or not you are predominatly Communist or Capitalist.\n\nMuch of the game is spent setting up enough housing for your population, building structures to keep certain politcal groups on the island happy enough to vote for you next election and on occasion, defending your buildings from rebel attacks.\nTropican citizens turn rebel when thier satisfaction levels drop too low, clicking on an indivdual citzen will show stars next to factors that determine his happiness. These stars usally 3 factors are noted, represent what is most important to this indivual, for expample job secruity or relgious satisfaction, if these needs are not met for a while he will cease to be a citizen of Tropico and join others hiding out in the island's wilderness.\n\nSpecial buildings can re-educate captured rebels, turning them back into a useful workforce.\n\nAnother important factor in the economic stability of the Tropican islands is tourism.\n\nTourism can be a huge boost to your government treasury, however care should be taken when you are planning your constructon phase as location of buildings is important, an ideal resort would have garages which produce cars, readily available for quick transport, hotels, entertainmt buildings and other money making buildings found under the tourism tab.\nAlso of note, is the tourism industry can at times cause a flood of people to land on the island, causing traffic jams and lengthy, expensive, holdups, not good for any busy island nation. Take care when expanding.\n\nThis may seem like a detailed review, however I have only covered some parts of the game, there is still more and I think continuing would only create a bigger wall of text and uncover all things best left undiscovered until one actually buys this game.\n\n\n","December 28, 2014","true","8.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That's my main complaint with Tropico. The game is, in essence, SimCity in a banana republic, balancing city-building with the burden of defending your fledgling republic against the many factions that are trying to destroy it. Its a terrific game, or it would be if it would let me better understand what is going on in my little empire. "Garage is overloaded", the game complains. Great, but which garage? And what constitutes "overloaded? and what effect will that have? Tourists aren't visiting my casino? Terrible, but why not? Is it too expensive? Is it not catering to their tastes? Can't they find it? I don't know. There's a little icon over one of my factories; I have no idea what it means but its probably not anything good. No idea what to do to fix the problem, though. I'm sure there is a complicated, worthy simulation running in the game, but God knows I'll never appreciate it because it refuses to open itself up to me. That means its fun for a few hours but hardly something on which to spend weeks or months, and that's a shame.","November 25, 2013","false","12.7"," 53 of 103 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","53","103","0","2"

However, looking back, it is highly worth the current price tag, and to be honest with the knowledge of what great game it is it would be easily worth up to £20.\n\nNow, moving on to the actual review, this game through my eyes is an easy pick up and play, going through the tutorial will sure, make your life easier, but to be honest it is not required.\n\nIn terms of graphics, it is suprisingly good in comparision to what I thought it would be, considering the game was made during the time of Windows Vista, XP, and very early variants of Windows 7, this game was as good as most games I play.\n\nIn terms of the type of game it is a bit of crossover between a city builder like Banished ( a lot newer but you get the point), and maybe the Sims, purely because of the different groups.\n\nNow, I'm just going to throw in a quick memo about groups, and that I think they are so brilliant executed, yet beautifully straight-forward.\n\nIn terms of the political system I love the alliance with the U.S/ U.S.S.R, I also think the Capitalists/Communist groups are well matched with a real life system. And the huge amount of diplomatic options.\n\nIn terms of replayability, the sandbox mode gives you that easily, and the campaign will keep you coming back for more every time.\n\nFinally, my last opinions of the game summed up: A brilliant game, provides hours of entainment of such a great pick-up and play, the controls are easy to remember, and the gameplay is quick and fluid enough, with a good insight towards to welfare of your citizens.\n\n9.5/10\n\nI hope you enjoyed this review, apologies for any bad English, I am not fluent.

Fun gameplay, cute graphics, happy music, humourous, doesn't get repetitive, easy to learn, hard to master in my opinion.

I got it for free not long ago from the Humble Store and for free, this game is great and I would of probably paid for it. Because of this, I'm thinking of looking into it's sequels and seeing if they're any better than this one. I do like the game though. Customisable character and customisable personality. The reason I like these games, as I have said in other reviews, is because I like the "Playing God" kind of game. The kind of game where you control everything and manage everything, build everything! It's all yours, your creation and whatever you want. I just love games like that and if there was a category to describe them, it'd be my favourite genre of game! Definantly recommended!

Over 2/3 of my island is unuseable, leaving me with hardly no place to continue on. I'm at a point where I might as well stop playing. All available land is built on, and I can do nothing else. Between the hills I can't flatten and the rocks I can't move, this game ceased to be fun. I even tried to start a new game in hopes that they would offer me a differnt island, but they didn't. I got the very same island that I had before, not good.  If you are looking for a game that has potential, but really limited fun. You can't even edit the map before you play or during the game, every sim game out today allows you to do that atleast. What were they thinking by ommiting this feature. This is the game for you. But for me, this game is a skip it!","October 4, 2014","false","3.6"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

I install it, (ridiculously small file size, amazed me)\n\nI love the game at first. It's charming, hilarious, and fun. However, the more I played over the next few days, I had found that the flaws were really, really glaring.\n\nFirst of all, it seems like you HAVE to have a randomized map. Why? Why couldn't they just put a few more hours just to put the map editor that they used when making the game?\n\nSecond, why can't I clear trees, rocks, and level terrain on my own? WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY THINKING?! Seriously..\n\nThirdly, why is everything so tedious? It seems like after you have more than 100 people it starts to be a chore.\n\nThe people are never happy, ever. I'd like to be able to lay back every once in a while and watch my people do their thing.\nIs that so much to ask?\n\nFinally, I feel like alot more could have been put into character creation. You are simply too limited to the point that I just barely was able to create Joseph Stalin (comrades 4ever), with his famous Stalin Stache. This isn't a biggy on my end, just that I'd like a little more customization.\n\nLast lastly: From what I can tell, there was alot of love and effort put into this game, but it simply doesn't do what it advertises, and that is city building.\n\nIt's probably one of my biggest gripes about the game. Wanna build an airport on seemingly flat terrain? Nope! Can't do that, joe. Wanna build some houses nearby but not inside of rocks? Nope, the modellers didn't bother making collision models.  Wanna make more than one skyscraper? Nope! For whatever reason, you can't have a CITY that has skyscrapers. Also,\nskyscrapers are not skyscrapers. They're just really tall buildings.\n\n4/10.\n","July 24, 2015","false","25.2"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","2","11","0","0"

This is not one of them. Kalypso and Haemimont Games have really thought this through, and delivered a game that is updated, but true to the roots.\n\nIf you too dream of being supreme dictator of some faraway caribbean island, Tropico 3 is the game for you. Like in the original Tropico, you are given a fair amount of freedom to rule your minions as you wish. Do you want to be a fair, benevolent leader, whom everybody loves and adores? It's up to you to decide whether you wish to be the fair, benevolent leader, or the cruel, corrupt tyran.\n\nTropico 3 has a bit of everything; political intrigue, decent level of simulation, good humour and cute graphics. However, coming from the original Tropico, I feel the campaign may be too easy. It's no problem to become filthy rich and make everybody love you.

So...\n\nGAMEPLAY\nTROPICO 3... is a fabulous and addicting game. It's all about being "El Presidente", managing an island banana republic and making it prosperous while embezzling some of the money for your Swiss bank account (which is non-crucial, it only serves for high score). You start every game by choosing your avatar, either pre-configured real ones like Che Guevara, Evita Peron and Voodoo Pizzaman or you can create your own. Then you start (always) with a banana republic which is in shambles and then you can do whatever with it by issuing edicts, constructing, pleasing different factions (like socially aware communists, hypocritical religious and more) and you rise through the difficulties and build a prosperous nation based on ore/coffee/rum/whatever exports... Or you pass a martial law and conscription edict and build a giant army... or ♥♥♥♥ off USA and make it invade you; the choices are many.\n\nCHARM\nNext, you have at first charming and humorous, but then repetitive Juanito who keeps Tropicans up to date on current issues, passed edicts and humorous event reports. The soundtrack is short but so sweet, you won't help but shimmy to the infectious salsa rhythm and graphics hold up pretty well (but it's a 2009 game, so it's kind of expected). The humor in this game is terrific and well though-out so you will definitely giggle at some of the event reports (like a llama assassinating El Presidente's favorite hat) and you will grow to curse at least one faction in this game. All of the mentioned elements make for a really freaking addicting game.\n\nMODES\nI first recommend playing the campaign mode, it is great to keep you occupied as you try to get through different goals and finish each island. The campaign mode definitely has some variety however even then, it will feel repetitive doing the same thing over and over again, just with a different end. The sandbox mode is great and there you can develop your island however you please and where you have your own ways of building a rich Carribean country.\n\nITERATION\nNow, it seems that this game is simply a remake of Tropico 1 and while I feel that's a good thing for newcomers, it brings nothing new to the table if you played the earlier games. Also, after a while it feels repetitive doing the same thing over and over again, you will eventually grow sick of it as every scenario you play starts the same.\n\nCONCLUSION\n+ Highly addictive and gratifying\n+ Salsa soundtrack\n+ Great humour\n\n+/- Remake of Tropico 1\n\n- Brings nothing new\n- Repetition\n\n8/10","August 19, 2014","true","26.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're like me, you might recall spending hours playing it on the computers in elementary school when you were supposed to be writing some stupid report or essay. Good times, right?  Well, this game is largely reminiscent of that experience. Its addictive qualities are nearly indistinguishable. This game is ideal for anyone who shares memories of Sim City 2000 even remotely similar to mine, and also for those with a God complex with need for sustenance ( hey, just saying -- but I don't have one!). Anyway, with the option to develop your city and watch it grow and to adjust the speed of the game in real time, it's a no brainer in my book. This is one game I certainly don't regret purchasing.

This Game can be really frustrating if the Odds are against you. It is hard to get a successful Island running, but if you get it done right, you'll have at least a sense of accomplishment. Which is, in times of Cities XL and XL2011, something we (strategy lovers) rarely get.\n\nThe only downside of Tropico 3 is that it gets a bit boring and repetitive in the long run.\nIf you know what you have to do, you'll get the Missions done easily, since they're all the same (more or less). It's still fun though.\n\nI'd say it's worth the 25 Euros for the Gold Edition.\n\n~El Presidente","January 3, 2011","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fear not, now you don't have to travel to Latin America, fight a guerilla war and stage a bloody coup. No, with Tropico you can be El Presidente from your own home. Tropico places the player into the role of president, with all the responsibility that comes with it. And may I tell you, it is fun! Like most citybuilders, Tropico does feature a lot of micromanagement, but in comparance to other titles, it never feels overwealming. And what takes this citybuilder to the higher level is the strong emphasis on political choices. Rigging elections, assassinating faction leaders and controlling your populations wealth is but a handful of the many many choices you have as El Presidente.","December 17, 2010","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A remake of the good old Tropico. Hence it's really hard and sometimes very confusing.\n\nIt is definetly NOT recommended for starters (you should buy something like Cities XL). This Game can be really frustrating if the Odds are against you. It is hard to get a successful Island running, but if you get it done right, you'll have at least a sense of accomplishment. Which is, in times of Cities XL and XL2011, something we (strategy lovers) rarely get.\n\nThe only downside of Tropico 3 is that it gets a bit boring and repetitive in the long run.\nIf you know what you have to do, you'll get the Missions done easily, since they're all the same (more or less). It's still fun though.\n\nI'd say it's worth the 25 Euros for the Gold Edition.\n\n~El Presidente","January 3, 2011","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is not one of them. Kalypso and Haemimont Games have really thought this through, and delivered a game that is updated, but true to the roots.\n\nIf you too dream of being supreme dictator of some faraway caribbean island, Tropico 3 is the game for you. Like in the original Tropico, you are given a fair amount of freedom to rule your minions as you wish. Do you want to be a fair, benevolent leader, whom everybody loves and adores? It's up to you to decide whether you wish to be the fair, benevolent leader, or the cruel, corrupt tyran.\n\nTropico 3 has a bit of everything; political intrigue, decent level of simulation, good humour and cute graphics. However, coming from the original Tropico, I feel the campaign may be too easy. It's no problem to become filthy rich and make everybody love you. This wouldn't be a problem, if the map generator was better, so you could make challenging sandbox games.","December 28, 2011","true","58.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game looks great and sounds even better. Trying to please all the different factions while trying to build up your economy, maintain optimum levels of employment and deal with the occasional disaster is challenging and fun. You even have customizable perks on your avatar that impart benifits or detriments to stuff like building cost or facton relations. Pro tip: get all the -%building cost perks. The only reservation I have about tropico is its scope. After you complete the campaign missions and play a couple custom maps, there isnt much else to do. Replaying the Campaign is way too easy especially when ypu use the right perks and user created maps are few and of questionable quality. The expansion adds a smaller campaign and some abilites which generally make the game easier.","August 9, 2011","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kazerniel/recommended/23490/","kazerniel","kazerniel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kazerniel/","625 products in account","The Tropico series is back with much improved visuals, modern UI and a bit more streamlined (and a lot easier!) gameplay. The game very well took on board the advances of the gaming industry since Tropico 1.\nThe visuals are quite excellent and atmospheric. I really like the lushness of the rainforest and the many tiny details on the buildings.\nI liked the music of Tropico 1 a bit more, except for the song "Asi! Vamos" which is awesome :D\nThe game itself has became noticeably easier, which is a welcome change, because I just couldn't keep my people happy and still sustain a working economy in Tropico 1.\nHaving an actual corporeal Presidente is an interesting addition, though I'm kind of ambivalent about it, because having an actual avatar doesn't seem to serve too much purpose. They boost whichever building or construction site they are at, and can give speeches from the Palace's balcony (which draws half the population away from their work for the duration of the speech). Aside of that Presidente just randomly wanders around the map and huffily complains whenever I select them :DVerdict: get the game for a modern take on Tropico's basic premise","August 4, 2015","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
