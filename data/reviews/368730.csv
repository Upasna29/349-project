"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldershot/recommended/368730/","aldershot","[F!] Aldershot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldershot/","2454 products in account","No Time to Explain is a comedic puzzle platformer that features ridiculous amounts of "rocket jumping". You have an extremely powerful and exaggerated laser, though sometimes the game will change it up with different weapons, such as an equally powerful and exaggerated shotgun. Rather than using these weapons to combat creeps, you'll be using them to traverse and solve the level.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtE9ev0oXSg\nThe mechanics are simple and easily understood. You can move left and right, jump, aim, shoot, and do a little jig (there is a dance button. Why? Reasons). It's really just that simple. You'll be using the game's weapon that it provides to work out a solution to the end of the map, with the map and the game's physics itself as your adversaries. As mentioned before, there are no mobs to fight (at least from what I've played). The only combat that I've experienced so far, with almost 2 hours in, is the boss fights them selves. The puzzles are satisfying and the map designs are smart, but I do feel the game could of gained rather than detracted if it threw in a few combat scenarios. It feels almost like a waste, that the player can't use these impressive weapons in more meaningful ways, other than traversing. Luckily, the puzzle and platforming aspect is quite well done and serves well as the game's main dish.\n\nThe presentation is a little simplistic but it does the job. It goes with a flash cartoon look, something similar to say Castle Crashers, but the characters and animation has a charming appeal to it. The game's focus on comedy really helps out with it's overall feel and atmosphere. It's probably not the best looker of the year, but there's something really lovable about the characters and the animation.\n\nOverall, No Time to Explain is an interesting take on the puzzle platform genre, with smart level design, charming animations, and ridiculous weaponry. I can safely say, I've enjoyed my time with the game.\n\nPros:\n- Charming and comedic characters and animation\n- The weapons feel very powerful\n- Smart map design\n\nCons:\n- Under utilizes the awesome weapons","July 19, 2015","true","2.4"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","23","31","0","2"

Controls are simple and intuitive, and while different characters will have different methods of getting around, the game does a good job of teaching you how to use them.

The first "no time to explain" on steam suffered from some of the worst performance issues and some of the most backwards programming i have ever seen from a steam release, which was compounded more since it seemed to run on windows aero and was only "compatable" with one version of windows (I believe i was using that version at the time and still suffered from god awful performance issues and glitches.)\n\nPros:\n+Comedy\n+Gameplay has it's moments\n+Less laggy and more responsive then the original (Framerate that doesn't make me suicidal)\n+Changed from fullscreen to windowed and unlike the original it didn't crash my computer.\n+Improved UI and menus\n+Little to no glitches when compared with the original.\n+The shotgun levels control great on controller / controller typically controls fine.\n+Music is nice\n\nCons:\n-JUMPING KILLS MOMENTUM NOW... I can't even wrap my head around that concept in a platformer\n-No option to turn off "screen shake" and other visual effects that in my oppinion add nothing to the game.\n-Only options to turn off sound FX and music, no option to turn off the future version of you's constant screaming.\n-There is no constant gamefeel, i attempted to just jump, 2 tiles high onto a ledge over and over and found you can make the exact same jump, only 2/3 times (THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE IN A PLATFORMER!)\n-Bad hitboxes\n-Bad level design\n-The telekinsis levels are awful to control on a controller EDIT: And now on keyboard and mouse aswell.\n\nJumping... gave me less momentum...\n\nOdd:\n~You can do a weird... "Double-momentum" jump or lazer acceleration if you move towards a corner. In a tighter platformer i would be okay with this but in this game it only serves to make me sometimes overshoot my jumps.\n~The original version had it so your lazer would quickly go from shooting "very thick" to "very thin" so you could get a visual representation of momentum, i don't know if this was changed for performance reasons.\n\nTL:DR: I would not recommend this game... It's 2 steps forward, 2 steps back although the original was attrocious to control it was at least expliotable, I could use the glitches in order to traverse faster. I'll use the comparison of sonic boom. This feels like sonic boom after they patched the "Knuckles infinite jump" By taking away the ability to jump and add momentum i've also lost most of the possible fun in regards to platforming.\n\nStill TL:DR: The momentum in this game is awful.\n\nEDIT: One hundred percented the game, to prove i know what i'm talking about.","July 22, 2015","false","6.4"," 42 of 69 people (61%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","61","42","69","7","5"

After this kind of description of a game, I really have no clue what you're waiting for, there's no time to explain, it's just perfect!\n\nAdvantages\nTotally random and stupid humor - I love every bit of it\nTon of fun, non repetitive levels to pass through\nCollectives are everywhere, but it's challenging to get some of them\nMusic and voice acting are awesome\nLocal co-op\nGame controls well in my opinion (tested on keyboard+mouse and controller)\nNice, cartoon graphics, typical for tinyBuild\nGreat level editor\nDisadvantages\nPlot is somehow random and it's not in the fun way - it doesn't connect to itself and appears only once every few levels\nPrice tag is too high for what the game offers\nSummary\nSimply fun and clever game, hits perfectly in my type of humor. It's fairly easy to pass, so rage quits - typical for some platform games - shouldn't happen, playing it is pure pleasure. Achievements are quite challenging, so beating this game once won't be enough for achiev hunters. Too bad that the story is not made in a different way, because for how it is now, it doesn't really "play any big role" in the game, unfortunately. But overall, I had some major fun playing it, as well as in the co-op and in single player mode.\n\nPersonal score\n9 / 10\nIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!","April 21","true","6.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/368730/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","“I’m you from the future! There’s no time to explain!”\n\nThus begins No Time To Explain, a game which seems so promising as you chase your future self through the first few levels as he screams about being horribly mangled by the giant enemy crab who sets off the whole story.\n\nWhile this is funny – and a very strong start – unfortunately, the game rather goes downhill from there. This is not because the gameplay becomes any worse, but because, while the silly story continues, it just isn’t as continuous after that point. It mostly takes place after zones, rather than getting those reminders in-zone of what is going on and what your goal is, and consequently, it basically ends up boiling down to the puzzles.\n\nNow, this isn’t entirely bad; the game is built up around the 2D platforming puzzles that make it up. There are a number of zones, and in most of the zones, you gain a new ability unique to that zone to help propel you through that zone – or else, there is some unique new gimmick the new zone has. Both work decently enough, and the variety means that the levels seldom feel too samey. All of the areas are quite short as well, meaning that you never end up spending too much time on any given level, and the respawns are pretty generous, with frequent checkpoints (with a couple of exceptions which largely make sense).\n\nBut a big part of the charm of the game is the ridiculous plot of you from the future warning you from the present, and the various silly things that happen as a result of that recursion, and without that in a lot of the game, it just kind of feels… there.\n\nHowever, the biggest flaw with this game is that it is a puzzle platformer with deliberately poor controls – that is to say, it is intentionally difficult to control your character and get them to do exactly what you want them to do. The primary challenge is making whatever janky ability you have in a new area work for you and aid you in getting through the stages without struggling too much. While the controls are not “loose” in the sense of being inconsistent, they are certainly finicky, and it is often more or less trial and error in getting just the right angle on your abilities to clear many obstacles. It isn’t that you don’t know what you’re supposed to do, it is that actually executing on what you’re supposed to do is quite hard – ultimately, the game is more of a technical challenge than an intellectual one.\n\nThe game itself feels a little bit cheap as well – the graphics are unimpressive, and the whole thing feels like it was made in Flash. There’s just nothing really there to impress, and while there are a few levels later on – in particular, the art level – which do more, it just isn’t really something that changed my mind about the game.\n\nFor all its flaws, the game isn’t bad. But it is kind of mediocre. I don’t regret my time playing it, but it isn’t anything to write home about, either, and your life will not be forever less for not playing it. It is passable, but no more.\n","November 25, 2015","false","4.6"," 50 of 88 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","50","88","2","0"

From being in a candy land to inside your own body this game is constantly changing it's visual style, challenges, and even game play during certain segments. This on top of the randomness make for one hell of a physics based puzzle game. No area in the game over stays its welcome and the game is constantly pushing something new on you, rather that be a boss fight or shifting into a shoot em up side scroller. There is also little things that give No Time To Explain a cherry on top. The game features a level editor, local co-op, and secret collectible hats.

It's not a smart, simple platformer, but instead a buggy and lazy one, as there is a major difference between a difficult game (a game that you can enjoy in the end) and a frustrating one. No time to explain is the second one. The levels of the platformer are poorly designed, the mechanics are simplistic, and they feel dumb. I won't even get started on how bad the controls are, because this started out as a flash game, and I would expect nothing more from it than the uninspired piece of junk with forced humour that it turned out to be. No, the game is not funny. No, it is not like Super Meat Boy. It represents the worst aspects of platforming and creativity combined (tough the dislike of the art style is pure prefference). Just do yourself a favor and save the $ 15 you would spend on this game. You won't regret not buying it.

It also includes other changes, mostly regarding some of the weapons, which, in some cases, makes them more difficult to use. Not that I dislike the added challenge, it's just something to keep in mind.\n\nIn case you have no idea what No Time To Explain is, because you never played the original game, it's a platformer game with a pretty hilarious story about time travelling, alternate realities, paradoxes, etc. It has lots of humour, so it's already worth it by that. Even then, I can say it's also a pretty solid platformer from a gameplay point of view; the different levels offer some interesting puzzles, in which you must use your weapon to move around safely. The soundtrack is pretty good as well, it has that chiptune style from old platformers, and it fits really well in this game.\n\nSo, to conclude, I can say I recommend No Time To Explain.","March 14","true","7.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's a game with a lovely concept that falls below in design.\n\nThe game claimed itself as a comedy platformer. They got the comedy right for sure. I love the writing and dialogue it's quite hilarious as it's about stopping your evil self with a goatee from ruining the past. The plot is bonkers and quite fun to watch. Gameplay however is very frustrating and feels clunky. Precision in a platformer is necessary and this game doesn't do it well. Bosses are all over the place as the difficulty curve waves frantically.\n\nAs a remaster it's pretty good. A lot of bugs have been fixed and new features have been added such as controller support and co-op. The level editor is still there so a community can stay present here. To conclude I think this game is worth your time if you can forgive its flaws. There is a game with heart that tinyBuild has made here. It can just get rage inducing though so keep that in mind. Campaign is short too so maybe wait on a sale. I give it a 6/10","December 11, 2015","true","3.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you don't mind the (occasional) difficulty of Super Meat Boy, consider this like SMB, but fun, heheh. It also has SMB's very wise design feature of instant respawn that keeps frustration a pathetic wannabe-obstacle.\n\nThis game kicks purchass!\n\nTechnically the game could use some improvements (menu options and usability, launch and load times!), but they seem to be in the making, and once I started playing the game, I had forgotten about those grievances in 10 seconds flat.\nYou need to be aware though that one level consists of a chain of little maps, so if you go to level selection, your progress is void. One level always ends with a boss, and that you need to finish in one go.\n\nThis game is a bragain.\n\nA propos ... On a personal note, it's funny how the most buyworthy games tend to approach for a bargain. It's just out (in remastered version), and in a Humble Bundle on tier 1.\nI woke up today to 18.8°C (again). Saw the bundle, checked the game here: 88% positive reviews. Bought it.

The controls are far better with a stick and still very easy to learn. That's just a hint before I get to the actual review! ;)\n\nNo Time To Explain is a game about you! Yes you, from the future, back to the past to fight against giant crabs, sharks, mules and yourself from the eviiiiiiil future! Of course there are tons of level riddles and challenges which you have to take on your way to overcome your evil future! They are coming in a wide range from jumping and floating to the next portal over shooting or pulling yourself as a hardened football player or frog-clone.\n\nBut enough of that technical and gameplay stuff, what really makes the game playworthy is the story and the way it is progressing! I laughed until I cried tears of pure joy on my stream and my viewers enjoyed the game as well. I really recommend to play this game with a friend or on stream because it increases the fun!\n\nThere are some user generated levels and one special level added at the end of the game as a bonus which is incredible funny and challenging again, after you beat the story. Go and try your skill on these crazy tracks, too!\n\nI clearly recommend you this timeless or timeful (?) game which will be a nice addition to your gaming library!","July 27, 2015","true","3.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","3","5","3","0"

Here is my original review for No Time To Explain http://steamcommunity.com/id/snortcannon/recommended/227280/\n\nNo Time To Explain is the remaster from the developers Tiny Build games. No Time To Explain is a puzzle physics platforming game where the main goal is to use a physics gun to launch yourself across levels.\n\nThe original game was very fun but now we have a remaster but is it worth your money ?\n\nFor people who haven't bought it already it's must own and for people who own it, I'll run down the fixes.\n\nThe game now has a very solid frame rate which was  a big problem in the original game. It was a pain in the ♥♥♥ to fight some of the bosses and some of the levels were a complete nightmare with the unstable frame rate.\n\nThe graphics are fixed up and look a little high res than the graphics from the original game which looked like a very poor flash game.\n\nThey added a life system which makes the game a challenge which the original game lacked off. The original game was really easy and the challenge is a nice touch.\n\nBut there are a few issues about this game too. The game is still kind of buggy. I found myself stuck on platforms and sometimes the gun wouldn't shoot, but overall it's not too bad.\n\nNo Time To Explain Remastered is a really good upgrade to a really fun game. For people who don't own it, this is a must pick up and for people who have this upgrade this is really worth another playthrough. The game is kind of difficult but this is still a very fun game. I give No Time To Explain Remastered a 8,5/10","July 31, 2015","true","3.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

Yes, that Unity.  This means No Time To Explain is more compatible, more playable, and, possibly, has a lot less bugs, crashes, bad stuff.\n\nI've only played this for a short bit and what I played I had fun with.

There was a certain point in the original game you simply could not get through, no matter what you tried. Anyway, the concept is great. You blast yourself around levels with this giant laser gun pursuing your future self who is being maimed by a giant crab... and eventually other things. (No spoilers here! :P) At times you'll find the laser gun propulsion parkour a little challenging, but you'll get the hang of it. Then they'll throw some new game mechanic at you and throw you totally out of the loop. Despite that, the voice acting is pretty well done and all performed by just one guy, seriously, kudos to him for his voice acting. The voice acting kinda fits the feel of the story itself too, which is a little cheesy with the whole time travel aspect. Overall, this game is a really funny, semi-short game that I'd recommend to anyone looking for a few laughs and a good time.\n\nOh yeah, and if you're still not sure about this game after reading this review, there's a flash version of the first few levels available. Just look it up, you'll find it somewhere, I'm sure. Thanks for reading and... OH CHRIST! MY RIBS! THEY'RE IN MY EYES!

THAT MAKES YOU FLY.  I MEAN SERIOUSLY GUYS COME ON.\n\nNow, the real review.\n\nIt ain't heavy on plot (or if it is, I haven't seen much of it), but that's okay - the bits that you do get give you enough "wait, WTF?!" moments to keep you eager to get moving.  They make you want to see what's over the next spike-studded hill.  And those hills *will* be spike-studded: this is something of a hardmode game in the vein of VVVVVV, Super Meat Boy, and the like, requiring both skillful control and a degree of planning in what you're going to do next.\n\nIt also ain't really combat heavy.  There are bosses, and the ones I've fought were fun and challenging, but aside from some detours from the standard play style it's mostly navigational challenges.\n\nWhat it has in spades is STYLE.  Every stage presents something new you have to work around, and the interaction between your character and the stage just makes things that much more interesting (especially when you end up in a different pair of shoes - or hat).\n\nSo yes, I have had a blast with the time I've already spent with it - and I intend to spend more still learning what more it has to offer me.

The graphics are a lot better, it controls better than the original, it even sounds better than the original.  The one thing that this game does that I didn't like was giving you a limited number of lives on the boss fights.  I understand why they did it, and it definitely added a new element of skill and strategy to some extent.  But I liked it better when I didnt have to worry about dying over and over again.  It was better when all I had to do was shoot whatever boss the boss was and not have to worry about getting hit.  That said, it's still a very good game, and certainly a step up from the original.","July 26, 2015","true","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChaosKirby98/recommended/368730/","ChaosKirby98","ChaosKirby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChaosKirby98/","80 products in account","Where the hell do I even begin?\n\nWell, I remember playing the original only because I watched Game Grumps play it.\n\nThe original was okay, given that you can turn off the guy screaming all the time (which was very ♥♥♥♥ing annoying), and only cause I was lucky enough to play it on a pc that ran it perfect. But then I got a new computer (Which was better than the old one) and it runs even worse. I learned it the hard way that the original engine was absolute dogshit.\n\nAnyway, they use a new engine now, and the game runs smoothly, which is great. However there are too many different physics and features that actually ♥♥♥♥ me off.\n\nFirst things first,\nThe life system\nNow, I remember playing the original, and it's like any old platform indie game. Challenging levels, bosses here and there, and infinite lives. Now they apparently decided to add in a "finite" life mechanic where when you're on boss levels (or certain levels), you have a limited number of lives. That number would be 5 (or 6, I didn't count how many exactly). 5 lives would seem plentiful, but there's only one problem with this.\nThe new physics ruins boss fights.\nHow, you may ask? Well, let's just say, now whenever you're standing still, and you start shooting, you slide. Doesn't sound like a big deal, but I had a lot of trouble on second boss (SECOND BOSS MIND YOU) because you have to shoot the shark, but, you have to avoid him, the pit below you, and the spikes. Plus the platforms they provide are extremely small, and you will fall to your death if you don't pay attention.\n\nNext thing,\nThe new physics engine\nYes, it's all fine and dandy that they got a new one. Certainly runs better than the original (as I stated before). However, my only problem is when you jump, it kills the momentum from your laser. Why? In the original, you were able to jump, and get even higher when you shot your laser when combining the jump and laser. however, now,  it gives you less height, and the only real way to get good momentum is if you do it frame perfect, or you just start shooting when you're standing on the ground.\nAnother problem I have with this, is the fact that in the original, when you shot the laser, you could see it shrinking, thus telling you that you are running out of laser power and you would need to touch the ground again to regain the momentum. In this game, there's no visual of that, therefore, if you relyed on it in the first, then yeah, have fun without the visual. It's only really frustrating because in the water levels, you would REALLY need the visual to be able to tell whether you can jump over a spiked wall or not.\n\n\nNow, I have beaten the game before, mind you. However, I feel that this new engine is just frustrating with the little tweaks and changes that have occurred. Even though the changes are minor, it's still very frustrating. It can (and does) change the entire flow of the game.\n\nOh, and another con with the new engine is with the football guy, you can't spam the shotgun when standing on the ground. It sends you flying and you have to wait before you can do it again. That was honestly fun to me. But this actually affects the game because in the level where you first play football guy, you have to use the shotgun to blast through the blocks in your way. In the original, you could keep shooting and keep moving forward. The new engine disagrees, and doesn't allow that. Thus taking more time to complete the level, and increasing your chances of death (♥♥♥♥ing spikes).\n\n\n\ntl;drRuns smoothly\nLife system on boss levels (and certain other levels) are annoying af.\nLife system consists of 5 lives or so\nNew physics engine makes your character slide when shooting on ground (really annoying)\nSliding on ground is horrible for Shark Boss fight.\nNo more football guy shotgun spam (new engine sends you flying everytime you shoot)\nJumping and shooting down doesn't help anymore.\nLong story short, the new engine has its ups and downs. Really annoying for boss fights, levels, pretty much the entire game, and life system really shouldn't be there either. It runs smoother, which is the only upside I see in this.\n\nIf you already have it, cool, but I really don't recommend wasting $15 to play this, unless you really want to.","July 29, 2015","false","1.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

This game is a fun platformer with unique mechanics. And every now and then the mechanics change a little, while still keeping the same idea. And several jokes and over-the-top stuff (no spoilers here)!\n\nPros:\n+ Graphics (smooth 60 fps! except on cutscenes)\n+ Music\n+ Gameplay\n+ The several jokes spread through the game\n+ Local co-op (requires gamepads)\n+ Keyboard+Mouse and/or Gamepad controls\n+ Steam Cloud and Steam Workshop\n\nCons:\n- No in-game resolution setting. You must hold SHIFT while starting the game to change the resolution. But the game looks uglier in higher resolutions.\n- The "beam" sound/noise can get annoying after a while.\n- No way to skip to a single specific level. We can skip to a levelset, but not to a level inside the levelset.\n- 1.2GB seems a bit too large. I believe the assets could have been better compressed/optimized.\n- Restarting a level takes a bit too long. The screen slowly fades to black, and a couple of seconds later the level restarts.\n- Cannot drop "guest" players without quitting.\n- Cannot change between gampad and keyboard+mouse without quitting.\n\nMisc:\n± The jump is useless. But you are not supposed to use the jump, anyway.\n± Collectible hats spread throughout the levels.\n\nYes, I recommend this game!\n\nThe "cons" are minor stuff (in my opinion), and are not deal-breakers.\n\nStill unsure? Wanna try it before buying it? Look for the in-browser "No Time To Explain" Flash game, it works as a demo/prototype for this game.","July 30, 2015","true","6.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Some become a real challenge to even get.\nYou get 3 lives in boss fights so if you waste them all and die you'll have to restart the entire fight.\nFor some reason jumping slows your cannon jumping now and you're better off relying on taking flight solely with the cannon when required.\nThe range in where you can get hurt from spikes seem to be larger though I can't tell if it's the spikes' kill range is higher or if your guy's hitbox is.\nGood fun but I can't say I'd pay 15 bucks for something this small in content though.","July 25, 2015","true","4.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Often times you know what you need to do, but because the game is, by design, hard to control, its just dying over and over to perform the task. Hard-to-control games can be fun; Surgeon Simulator and Octodad are both examples of that. But those games instead always make sure that you're making progress. You can be careful and even mess up, but you can slowly make progress. You can slowly get a better idea of how to play those games.\n\nNo Time To Explain does not do that. No Time To Explain is not that. You will die a lot, not because you made mistakes, but because its designed to do that. While there are plenty of checkpoiints through the short levels to make sure you don't have to retry the crazy difficult maneuvers a second time, you don't ever realy learn how to control it better. The checkpoint system is merely a mercy call.\n\nMaybe this game is better for short spurts. A game to slowly chip away at. Its fun, sure, but its not worthy of great admiration. Get it on sale and kill time with it, but I can't imagine it'll be on anyone's favorites list.","August 26, 2015","false","3.5"," 14 of 30 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","14","30","2","2"

I feel like it should be available at any given time but it isn't.\n- The game doesn't have a community as far as I'm aware. (Probably an issue with marketing rather than the game.)\n- The map editor is a cluster of garbage maps and a lot of spam as a result of the lack of a community.","August 31, 2015","false","0.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The game is a platformer where you chase yourself, and you move around by shooting a beam in the opposite direction. Its kind of novel and fun at first, but then the levels get tougher and it just ends up being more of a frustration than fun. The problem is its a super strong beam that sends you flying. You have very little control, and its hard to maneuver in the air. Also, it stops sending you up very quickly. Also, you can jump, but you barely go off the ground, which doesn't do you any favors. Also the controls of L2 jumping is less than ideal and finnicky.\n\nThen theres the beam itself. So if you want to go up you have to shoot. But the problem is when there are destroyable objects above and below, which the game likes to do. This means jumping destroys the objects below you. But you have to shoot the objects above you, but this sends you flying. Its super hard to aim it to destroy specific blocks, and since you barely can jump, but you can't get up high because you have to destroy the blocks below you. When you try to be precise the gun's super large beam with destroy everything around the single block you want to, also because it moves you. Then theres the boss fights. What should be simple fights of you dodging and shooting, turn into anything but. This is because of the stupid beam. When you try and shoot at the enemy above, below, or to the side, it sends you flying, usually into a spike or to your death. So you can neve just stand your ground and shoot him above you, because.....you know, the annoying unnecessary beam. Also the jump sucks and barely moves you, so you are forced to use the beam to get around. With single mistake deaths and only 3 lives, while the boss has lots of health, it just makes the bosses harder than they should be. After playing this game it makes me appreciate simple jumping and movement, and being able to shoot someone above you without it auto-killing you. Avoid unless you like things that are unnecessarily harder than they should be, just to be different.","October 26, 2015","false","5.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/techbane/recommended/368730/","techbane","Techbane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/techbane/","875 products in account","I'm going to lead with the strong points: It's funny as hell if you like absurdist humour. The presentation is good, the animated assets are pretty simplistic but fluid, music is pretty great, it's a novel concept, and there are times when I had fun with it. But despite all the blood, sweat and tears that have gone into making a more functional release of the game, it turns out that even functioning (mostly) as intended, the design of the game makes for kind of a crapshoot experience.\n\nIn a nutshell, the crippling blows are inconsistency and frustration factor. Jetting around on that laser pulse is not an accurate science, and the hitboxes of spikes and other hazards are extremely unforgiving. When you die, you will typically reappear on the last patch of solid ground you stood on, but the detection for this is picky sometimes, the laws of mechanics change from level to level, and some levels require you to make a series of ridiculously precise jumps and hovers before touching down, making for some insane difficulty spikes. On certain levels or when dying to certain hazards, death will restart the level entirely. Sometimes level elements STILL don't behave as intended, particularly in the candy world. Level design as a whole often feels redundant and amateur, making you do the same sorts of jumps with different mechanics and layouts, rather than exploring more varied ways of using the existing mechanics like the laser-bending bolts.\n\nBesides the laser, there are levels that give you similar but varied means of propulsion, some of which are more fun than the laser but you see very little of, others which are interesting in theory but due to their implementation are just a further frustration in control factor.\n\nThe Remastered edition has done this much: it stabilized the game, and retooled the boss levels and chase sequences to give you 3 spare lives, rather than switching back and forth between "infinite lives" and "no lives" on a case-by-case basis. It also added several new lines for the characters, which unfortunately stand out rather blatantly and don't sound as good, but whatever. I was, finally, able to complete the game rather than throw up my arms somewhere around the halfway point after falling through the level and breaking the scripting for the Nth time. I would even say it's maybe worth picking up at the $3-$5 level if you have a high tolerance for frustration factor.\n\nPersonally, I'm just glad to be done with it, able to watch the ending, and not have it lurking in my half-completed games list forevermore.","July 17, 2015","false","1.7"," 19 of 42 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","19","42","0","3"

It starts off with a bang and throws you head first into your time travelling alternate dimension journey.\n\nIt starts of silly, and gets crazier as time goes on. I think this is a real little gem of a game, although it could do with being priced a little lower.\n\nYour basic weapon is a giant laser like beam weapon you both use to fight the giant beast attacking your future self, and to propel yourself around the map and obstacles. The mechanics are simple, propel yourself around spikes, traps and and platforms to catch up to your currently being mutilated future self and save him. It's not easy though, it's really not easy; but the music, sense of urgency, and cries from your future self are hilarious and blood pumping.\n\nDid I mention there are hats? Yes, you can collect hats through the zones, and secret little areas and become all the fashionable rage as you travel through space and time battling space crabs and saving yourself. You can also press spacebar and do a little jiggle dance. For extra awesomeness get the funkiest hat, and jiggle and laser your way through dimensions.\n\nAfter finishing a set of areas and a boss battle, you get to the starting area with floating orbs. Blow these up and you have a portal to yet another dimension, with new enemies and yet another self that needs saving as they're being mauled.\n\nIt really is a fun little game, it might not look like it has a story but it does. As convoluted and confusing it might appear as you play at first. Things do make a bit more sense as you progress.\n\nIt's darn fun, the looks well and plays well. If it has a leaderboard I'd probably always be at the bottom, but hell it's fun.\n\nBiggest issue is the price, it's a good game. Is it worth €14,99 though? That's hard to say.\n\nPC Gameplay\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRwTE2IN9Q","July 17, 2015","true","2.4"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"

I've beaten it twice and had so much fun that I would consider paying full price to buy it for a friend.\n\nEven if nothing ever changes in this game, it already sits among my favourites.  If a sequel comes out and has the same adorable and hilarious style, the same hyperactive pacing and varied gameplay, and mind-bending plot, I would likely buy it at full price rather than wait for a price drop.  Seriously, this game is awesome.  Some of the levels can be frustratingly challenging, but it's only occasional and it adds to the charm.\n\nMy second time beating this was in 2-Player mode and we had a blast!  It had issues though:\n- Game could benefit from a LEGO-game style adaptive split-screen (currently no zoom-out or split screen)\n- Beams still cancel each other out even if the end boss is between the two players.\n\nOther things I'd love to see in this game are:\n- for it to have alternate button images for PS3/PS4 controllers.\n- There's a bug I'd like to see fixed.  If you do not select Keyboard/Mouse as your control scheme (or sometimes if you used a gamepad and switched to mouse), I find the game doesn't automatically take precedence over the mouse.  So if you're using a game pad and click a mouse button, the game pauses and you go to your Desktop.  That's hard for me, because my PS4 trackpad is mapped as a mouse.  Thank goodness the game pauses!!  That's thinking ahead! <3","September 21, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is constantly trying to trick and troll you by subte means. It's very short, about three hours long (also includes a map editor for user made screens, but I'm not too fond of that stuff for most games). It plays rather much like a flash game, with the elements of complexity revolving around left-clicking and things like direction and moment.\n\nThere's a fair ammount of variety to the game mechanics. There are decent boss fights which tend to range from too long to too easy, but still manage to be enjoyable and use the game mechanics well.\n\nThere's a rather lengthy reference to the 'are video games art' debate, which I think is outdated to the point where only people who play nothing but Madden and people who are so liberal they think Burney Sanders is a fascist would bother arguing about. Anyway, those levels are very easy and aren't really funny, even though it constitutes about 80% of the game's unspoken dialogue. It slows down gameplay, and just annoyed and distracted me.\n\nOtherwise, the spoken dialogue is funny, but there's not a whole lot of it. No Time to Explain, in general, is very creative, but they could have done a lot more with the open-ended concept. The level editor leaves a lot to be desired, with no way to design full level campaign, the editor can only make a single screen. There doesn't seem to be a way to add any of the game's various 'suit powerups' in the editor.\n\nFor a short game, I'd say it's worth a playthrough, and is somewhat iconic of the cheap indie spectrum. It could have done a lot more, and it's pretty flash-game like. Still, definently a step ahead of even the best flash games. That said, for games this short I generally want more of a story, something with more context than a platformer with about 8 worlds and 25 levels.\n\nI would not recommend it at the silly price of $15. Not for a 3 hour platformer with an editor that's an afterthought.","September 16, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I fell in love with the game.\n\nLater, The Remastered version came out. I talked to a friend about it, and he surprised me by gifting it to me.\n\nOne of my favorite games I must say.\n\nPros:\nHas a good length and workshop(Though personally I don't use the workshop, and its not that big anyway).\nSteam Trading Cards.\nVery Speedrun Friendly(As you can see in the achievements).\nMade me crack a smile quite a few times, and the artstyle is pretty cool.\nHATS.\nPretty unique elements in each world.\nCheckpoints based on the last safe ground you stood on before you died. This is a pro as this saved me from restarting the levels over and over again in a few worlds, but also a con at other times.\n\nCons:\nLong loading times. The game is pretty speedrun friendly, EXCEPT for the loading times, and even I who can't speedrun to save my life, is bothered by this. At least when returning from most deaths the game doesn't need to load anything.\nCheckpoints based on the last safe ground you stood on can also screw you over in levels that you can fall from above onto the ground, forcing you to start over from the ground even if you die.\nFire is annoying as dying to it makes the whole level re-load and it persists between safe ground checkpoints.\n\nOverall, I would honestly reccomend this game. Its not perfect, but its pretty good.","October 18, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is constantly trying to trick and troll you by subte means. It's very short, about three hours long (also includes a map editor for user made screens, but I'm not too fond of that stuff for most games). It plays rather much like a flash game, with the elements of complexity revolving around left-clicking and things like direction and moment.\n\nThere's a fair ammount of variety to the game mechanics. There are decent boss fights which tend to range from too long to too easy, but still manage to be enjoyable and use the game mechanics well.\n\nThere's a rather lengthy reference to the 'are video games art' debate, which I think is outdated to the point where only people who play nothing but Madden and people who are so liberal they think Burney Sanders is a fascist would bother arguing about. Anyway, those levels are very easy and aren't really funny, even though it constitutes about 80% of the game's unspoken dialogue. It slows down gameplay, and just annoyed and distracted me.\n\nOtherwise, the spoken dialogue is funny, but there's not a whole lot of it. No Time to Explain, in general, is very creative, but they could have done a lot more with the open-ended concept. The level editor leaves a lot to be desired, with no way to design full level campaign, the editor can only make a single screen. There doesn't seem to be a way to add any of the game's various 'suit powerups' in the editor.\n\nFor a short game, I'd say it's worth a playthrough, and is somewhat iconic of the cheap indie spectrum. It could have done a lot more, and it's pretty flash-game like. Still, definently a step ahead of even the best flash games. That said, for games this short I generally want more of a story, something with more context than a platformer with about 8 worlds and 25 levels.\n\nI would not recommend it at the silly price of $15. Not for a 3 hour platformer with an editor that's an afterthought.","September 16, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Because… it is somewhat creative and the game keeps this running gag about no time just throughout the whole story.\n\nThe levels are challenging but never really unfair. They will test your skills and you will become better while beating the game, beating it a second time is not as hard as the first time. Each grand section introduces some kind of new mechanic which keeps a refreshing pace of changes when a new section starts. Some parodies of games are in there as well, you will spot them when they are there.\n\nIt is a nice filler if you just want to play something oldschool with some weird physics and a gun which is more used like some kind of jetpack. The soundtrack is well made, you feel remindet to many other games which already are out there as well. Yes, Top Gear from the SNES will come back into your ears as well…\n\nOh and the hats… I still did not collect all of them, I am missing 4 of them…\n\nGET THIS GAME!

The main reason i have to talk bad about movement is cause of the ways you have to move in later levels, it feels horrible. while your character moves towards your mouse for example you can move your mouse around, so you can move the character while in the air with a new movement command, BUT you cant see where you move your mouse while your character is still moving towards your old mouse location actually go up and not drop down, making it very annoying to make precise quick movements like going up and then a sharp right turn or something cause you have no idea where your mouse exactly is.\nAlso it seems buggy meaning that the movement suddenly stopped a few times, spikes kill you and dont spawn you where you should spawn and the boost in the air you get from shooting below you sometimes didnt really work the way it should either (big boost when on the ground - small boost while in the air when you jumped before you shoot)\nSetting wise ... there is nothing really. You cant change controls, you cant change resolution. atleast you could change the audio volume and mouse sensitivity.\nAll in all its a fun idea but bad execution.

The game is challenging but it's fun and easy to pick up and play!\n\nNo Time To Explain's humor is really funny and I love the voice actor who plays the guy with the ray thingy. It has cool and unique assets and good local multiplayer\n\nThe only thing I would complain about is sometimes the game can get too hard and frustrating especially with the ray thingy you get in the beginning of the game also sometimes the game glitches whilst respawning\n\nI can't understand why the game got remastered because I see no difference between the original and this remastered version unlike games like The Binding of Issac and it's remastered counterpart\n\nNo Time To Explain: Remastered is a fun game to play but too frustrating for me to play also, if you purchase SpeedRunners, you will receive No Time To Explain: Remastered for free!

Somehow this game is in my library and I didn't buy it. And it says I got it back in December.\n2. It's a fun game actually with good controls and it's hilarious I like it.\n3. I played 7 minutes of it and I feel like the game is over and I just wasted my time.\n4. That time I wasted wasn't so bad. Just the graphics and everything made me feel drunk.\n5. I don't know why I am writing this review.\n6. Please help me\n7. Not worth $15 but I got it for free so who cares\n8. After 5 minutes you get bored and you feel like you beat the game and have nothing to do in life.\n9. This may cause suicidal thoughs acording to some people.\n10. This game is weird but good\n\n\nOverall I would give this a 4.4/10. Not a bad game not worth the $15. But some people may think it is.","May 29","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So i just wanna say its worth it story mode is good, funny and hard if you play alone but otherwise, it is AWESOME","June 1","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay can feel repetative at times and the bosses dont vary greatly, but it is definitely worth giving a go.","June 5","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a local co-op and usually these kind of games aren't local but since this is that makes it really good.\n\n2. For some reason this game appeared in my library randomly without me buying, so that confused me but whatever.\n\nI really don't know how I got this game but it's pretty cool.
