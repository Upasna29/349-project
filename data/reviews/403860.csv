With guns and ammo. Are told to grab stuff with E (that magically appears in random places) just so you can shoot magically appearing deer , zombies and ravens while trying to survive. There is no wave system. Objective seems to be to mindlessly survive monsters.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point. The AI is non-existent. Enemies spawn randomly in the map. Even behind you feet away. They run up to you and try to hit you. When they get stuck they jump around to get unstuck....\n\nMy play through involved walking up to a building , standing in a corner and effectively being invincible because the AI can't find pathing to me.\n\nIt feels like a school project. Or 1st attempt at making a game. Its incredibly bare and lacking. I do see some positive in it. As it ran smooth and the idea is nice. But there is just nothing here yet as far as a game. Its mindless and pointless shooting at an incredibly mindless AI.\n\nDef not recommended as there are plenty of much better titles in this price range with actual gameplay that is fun.","January 25","false","0.1"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","23","29","2","0"

Thankfully  I was  actually very  pleasantly surprised when I did finally boot up the game.  You really need to keep your wits about you  while playing because   zombies,  and other   animals will spawn  close behind you as well as in front, and  with  several different types of  zombie spawing randomly, some of which are quite challenging to  kill because they are so quick.  You will soon find yourself losing  lives rapidly.\n\nPersonally I'd much rather play Alpages in third person,  because  then  I'd be able to  see  zombies and other animals spawning behind me  without having to change my viewpoint constantly; unfortunately  that  isn't an option and consequently  I died regularily  until I developed  a style of play that had me circling  virtually all of the time to keep my sixes in sight.  This did initially  give me  a little  sea sickness and was exhausting, but  once I got used to the style I was able to survive for much longer, and managed to find   three of the books  before   losing all of my lives.\n\nI've played the game  so far for  over three hours and have still to get close to   beating  this  very challenging game, that has  decent  graphics  and sound effects (for the price), with a day and night cycle (when you respwan), and  some very atmospheric and at times  spooky   environments  with the occasional maze like area's that can leave you dazed and confused (I'm now playing  my original copy of  Led Zep's first album  on my old record deck) and for the ridiculoulsy low price of £0.79/$0.99 there are enough game play  elements such as   power ups; for example, other weapons,  ammo and health plants,  and if you  die, the books you are collecting  do spawn in different places, so you never know  where they are going to be  from each play through,  making  Alpages a very replayable  game and IMO  well worth purchasing.\n\nIt's not the best survival game I've played, but  really,  for the price, the time and effort I've personally put into the game has been   a very positive experience and does not deserve such a  negative  score that it has so far garnered. At least a couple of hours of game play is needed to really appreciate this game.\n\nCheck out  AtypicalChuck's review  HERE, which I think gives a good and well balanced review of this game.  What I don't understand is why     loads of negative reviews come first before you see any thumbs up.  That is bound to put a damper on  a lot of  community members before  they even check  the game out via You Tube to see for themselves what the game play entails. The following videos were not  recorded by me.  I've added them so that you can see   some game play footage.  Both are worth watching through, (one is  in French and one in English). The French guy makes me laugh  in a pleasant sort of way.\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zGaVMHmv-o   (43 minutes)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaBdx6dip94  (9 minutes)","May 25","true","3.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atypicalchuck/recommended/403860/","atypicalchuck","AtypicalChuck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atypicalchuck/","389 products in account","Disclaimer: I participated in the beta and was provided press access for ALPAGES: The Five Books for review purposes.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/IXPT39Dmwl0z\n\nAlpages is an interesting game; it's evolved from a "Slender" style exploration game with some of the best jump scares I've ever had in my horror game career (admittedly with not super great graphics). The beta was impossible for me to beat as the waves of enemies were relentless and you had no way to defend yourself. The current incarnation has changed drastically as it is more of a FPS zombie horde survival style with much better graphics.\n\nBasically, I've played a lot of Alpages in my career so I have an admitted bias in that regard.\n\nThe long and short of Alpages is you are trying to find five huge floating books and each book you find amps up the never ending onslaught of zombies and also adds an additional big bad guy to stalk you and pose problems for your search. The Witch is the first "boss" and the one you have to kill... which you can't do until you get the last book which weakens her.  After you kill her you win.  You get a certain number of lives and can find lives on the map so if you die you don't have to start all the way over like in beta.  Your health is a percentage and if you get hit and go to 0% you're dead.  You can find plants to heal yourself with randomly on the map.\n\nThe developer is a very nice guy from France as is super enthusiastic about his games.  Like, crazy enthusiastic. I think it's a great quality however if it's true that comments are being deleted from the forum that is not cool whatsoever.\n\n...but this is a game review so let's get down to brass tacks.\n\nAlpages: The Five Books is fun and has a bit of challenge to it but I wish they had done some things differently.\n\nPros:\nGraphics have improved a great deal since beta.  A wider assortment of zombies and the main baddies are less neon teal.\nThe night time environment is spooky and disorienting making the zombie attacks starling and effective.\nThe music is old school 80's and very awesome.\nThe map is not as large as before which is nice as it takes less stumbling around to find the next book.\nGun combat is nothing super new but implemented well enough. Two weapons to choose from and lots of ammo drops (You'll need them).\nThe game tosses a LOT of mobs at you which keeps you on the move and I had a good time spraying them with my AK.\nI was able to beat this game unlike the beta which felt pretty good.\nThe Teddy Bear is awesome and the Plant was a fun addition and very disruptive.\nThe gory piles that show up on the ground when you kill stuff was gross and I liked it.\nWhen you get low on health the world goes grey making it near impossible to see the red health pickups and adding some fun urgency to the situation.\nCons:\nThe beta's best feature was random non-stop jump scares, both in game and overplayed on the screen (Exorcist w/ screams) and also had a TON of creepy, hokey voices and sound effects.  Those are nearly gone except for a couple creepy voices and it was disappointing.  I enjoyed the rush.\nThe gun combat doesn't feel necessary for the game.  Horror games are more fun for me when you are defenseless.\nThe graphics are better but may be a turn off for new players\nThe ending is abrupt and unsatisfying outside of the victory you achieve.\nThere are too many extra lives, you should start with 3 and deal with\nThey need to add story elements to the game instead of laying it out on the title screen. Add some character to the character and make you care.\nThe Witch was too easy to kill at the end after getting the last book.\nAlpages is going to get a lot of ♥♥♥♥ because it's not the best.  I say give it a chance, for the low price point it was fun to play and stream as it is campy and rough and visually interesting. They said they'll continue to update it in the months ahead. I hope they do as there could be a better and scarier time in here if they make some tweaks.  Still, don't go into this expecting a big budget blockbuster you will be disappointed.","October 24, 2015","true","0.9"," 17 of 59 people (29%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","29","17","59","4","1"

At first I made it to the mill and some goofy voice yelled "Give me your blood" I thought it was funny but then the zombies appearing and attacking made it  more intense. Roaming and searching for the books knowing anytime they can appear also keeps you on your toes. Also you gotta watch your back cause they will sneak up on you. The backround music is also something thats adds to the suspense. Its early access so yes there are things to work on. I dont realy care that theres no introduction story to know how you ended up there. You just start the game. The obvious things are I want to see a health bar and ammo bar. The aiming could be improved as well. I'd prefer to start off with a double barrel shotgun, 2 rounds then you need to reload. Then work up to finding better weapons, like the M4, or maybe a semi auto RugerMini14, revolvers, pump action shotguns,  maybe even a machette.  Oh and can we get a pause button please.
