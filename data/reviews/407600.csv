Weirdly enough the non-Steam versions do not have this issue and are fine. (at least for me on my computer) Avoid this product till DotEmu fixes these issues!\n\nEDIT: Game runs at 54fps normaly not 57fps like I stated in the review before. Also I fixed a couple of typos. Also DotEmu have released a patch today but I am unsure if it fixes these major gameplay issues.","December 10, 2015","false","0.1"," 148 of 164 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","148","164","5","10"

Music plays much faster than it should, is incredibly annoying. The devs don't care at all. No hope of any of the problems being fixed. Avoid buying this game and avoid anything involving DotEmu. Pick up Raiden IV instead, that is a great port and one of the best games in the Raiden series.","December 10, 2015","false","1.6"," 63 of 73 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","63","73","0","1"

However, the emulation could have been much better. There's no way to increase the framerate, there are hardly any screen filter options, there's lag (even when booting the game up), and the sound quality is off. If you absolutely MUST play the Raiden FIghters games, this is one of the rare cases where I recommend the console version instead of the PC version (Raiden FIghters Aces may not include the original Raiden, but the amount of visual options and the ability to play at 60 FPS make it a better deal than this). And, while legally-gray to say the least, there's always MAME. While I still enjoy these games despite the emulation problems, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but the most diehard Raiden fans.","December 10, 2015","false","1.0"," 36 of 49 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","36","49","2","4"

These games are among my favorite classic vertical shooters. This is, however, probably the worst version of them that exists.\n\nDotEmu has already released one small patch, so hopefully there will be more. They are needed. If things get fixed I'll edit this review to reflect it.\n\nThe Good:\n\n- Four awesome shooters for ten bucks. This includes Raiden, Raiden Fighters, Raiden Fighters 2, and Raiden Fighters Jet. These games rock and this is one more game (Raiden) than Raiden Fighters Aces for the Xbox 360 includes.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Poor emulation. The games don't run at the correct framerate. This causes video stuttering, audio stuttering, and an overall poor experience compared to other versions of these games.\n\n- Buggy. Menu settings often don't save. Simply accessing the menu (without changing any options) will sometimes change things such as autofire mode and music volume.\n\n- No rapid fire. UPDATE: With their second patch DotEmu has added a Rapid Fire ability.\n\n- Extreme lack of options compared to better versions of these games.\n\nConclusion:\n\nYou can get these great games many other ways, and Raiden Legacy - Steam Edition should be your last resort. If you don't have access to the original arcade boards then Raiden Fighters Aces for the Xbox 360 is a GREAT port with smooth gameplay and is absolutely overflowing with options. If you really want these on the PC then you should look to MAME or the GOG version of Raiden Legacy first, as it has been reported to run better than the Steam version currently does.","December 12, 2015","false","2.0"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","1"

This collection simply does not look, sound, or play anywhere near as good as the Raiden Fighters Aces collection and it doesn't have nearly as many options or even start you off with the same number of ships in Raiden Fighters. The existence of this game on Steam just makes Aces, a superior game, less likely to show up. How disappointing. And no, I have not actually logged over 400 hours with this game--I just couldn't get it to work at first (shocker) yet it ran in the background somehow. I don't know.\n\nBoo, DotEmu. Boo.","January 17","false","418.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

It includes four great games full of action and plenty Bullet Hell moments. The overall playing time of the package exceeds 15 hours and with so many crafts to chose from is certain that you will never ever get bored.\n\nIn Raiden Legacy, the spin offs of the franchise are presented in their perfect form, distributing the content in many different mods. In arcade mode is sufficient the choice of a craft before you start your assault to destroy the countless enemies that are distributed to each stage. The mission mode is a bypass of the initial missions so you can start directly from the advanced levels, increasing the possibility to proceed a step further. The online mode is the best there is in the game but goes along with a major problem. If you dont have friends who bought Raiden Legacy you will wait a long time, perhaps in vain, for some online teammate showing up. On the other hand, the online dimension of Raiden forming a huge virtual coin - op area where passionate pilots compete from around the globe and their scores are listed in the scoring boards to monitor everyone's progress giving the contestants a powerful incentive to continuously improve their performance.\n\nIf you wanna see some videos of the game to get a better idea about it check my channel here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuAlrmwwKDyWsYMtRVcu-VbJkhvc7bVzx\n\nGiannis Moschonas\n\nEditor in www.gameworld.gr\n","May 12","true","8.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"
