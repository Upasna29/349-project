"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NotMyPolicy/recommended/422980/","NotMyPolicy","NotMyPolicy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NotMyPolicy/","261 products in account","This game is rage-inducing, challenging, and has made me angry at my controller countless times within the first 20 minutes of playing. Oh wait, not countless times. Exactly 97 times within 20 minutes. That's how many times I died within the first 14 levels on easy mode.\n\nSuper Robot Jump Jump is a fantastic platformer true to the genre. There aren't any deviations from what it claims to be. It is a challenging platformer through and through. The music sets the tempo of the game as you blast through parts of the level after dying to a god damn cloud over and over again. As soon as you make an error you tap Y (on the gamepad, my preferred method of platforming) and reset the level immediately. The pace is fast, the challenge is high, and the rewards are great!\n\nThere is no feeling like that of completing a level that increased my death counter from 47 to 82 (Level 12 Ugh). The art is cartoony and whimsical with a story and voice over work that matches that feeling beat for beat. If you enjoy challenging platformers like Super Meat Boy or comedic platformers such as BattleBlock Theater, I would definitely recommend Super Robot Jump Jump.","March 31","true","5.3"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","15","17","3","0"

I just finished Salt and Sanctuary and am eagerly anticipating Dark Souls 3. After a few hours of SRJJ my controller is adequately sweaty and I am equally as salty. I'm only on level 27 but this game is really fantastic if you're willing to put in the time. Controller is highly advised. Good, brief narrative cutscenes and some really fantastic soundtrack (Volcano level is epic as hell)","March 31","true","1.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","12","14","2","0"

I went into the game thinking it was gonna be similar to Super Meat Boy and the game did not disappoint.  There are two modes , easy and hard.  I highly recommend starting on easy mode, because to be honest, it gets fairly difficult early on even on "easy".  Of course if you really want to feel that adrenalin when you RAGE, then by all means, start off with hard mode.  :P\n\nThe gameplay is basic, but works quite well.  The graphics/art style of the game is very pleasing to the eye, and the soundtrack is excellent.  I am totally going to continue playing this game, not only did the gameplay pull me in, but the story is fun as well.  I definitely think this is a game that is gonna take off once more people find out about it.  For a small developer, the game is very well done.\n\n\nIf you are interested in seeing my first hour playing this game and to get a closer look at what the game has to offer, here is a link...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XrXB8NaYfM\n\n\nI made it through the first two worlds.... and look forward to seeing what else this game is gonna throw at me.\n\n\n***Key provided by Developer for review purposes.  I make it clear when I review games that I am honest in my reviews, no matter if the key is provided or not.  I had a lot of fun playing this and if it wasn't good I would not be recommending it.","April 2","true","2.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

The first few levels show you the basics, then the difficulty ramps right on up, and I very much prefer it that way; no hand holding, just "here's your controls, now go die".\n\nThe story is cute, with some hilarious little jokes sprinkled in, and the animations are great.\n\nFast-paced and hard as balls, I'd recommend this game any day.","April 3","true","3.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

If you enjoyed Super Meat Boy, highly recommend checking this out. EDIT: I've put more time into this game and just wanted to add, I'm on normal mode and up to 2300 deaths already, after completing world 3 (60 levels). This game is very good at tilting me, but at the same time, making me want to push myself to beat the next level and this is on normal mode. If you like a challenge, I highly recommend giving this game a shot.","March 31","true","14.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Tons and tons of levels that start out nice and easy to teach you the mechanics and then ramp up to crazy hard. The art style is really nice, but the best thing is the smooth perfect controls. Lots of other platformers don't get this right, but Super Robot sure does! It has has local multiplayer so it's great to play on the couch with a friend and leave them to die as you race through the level :)","April 4","true","1.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

The narration overlay makes for nice company too while you're trying to get through the same set of obstacles over and over too. 5/7 would rage again.","April 14","true","3.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"
