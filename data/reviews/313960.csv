Before buying it download the demo and see if you can play a couple of hours without problems.  Not everyone experiences these crashes, but I do.  I also have an old computer with a small amount of RAM, so I'm inclined to blame myself rather than the developers.\n\nExodus has a fun world to explore where the player will discover plenty of secrets and collect loads of energy orbs.  Energy orbs are the currency for upgrading skills and aptitudes.  Subsequently these skills, such as double jumping enable deeper access into the world.  You'll also need some combat abilities to deal with creatures that get in your way.  Other abilities that can be obtained include dashing, and grappling.\n\nThe graphics are hand drawn and have a warm look to them; they are charming and consistent.  The game music fits well with the world of Exodus and reminds me of songs composed by Jean Michel Jarre.  Everything is held together with a small story to explain why Zoulux\Ly'sax is there in the first place.\n\nEven though the crashing is a big turn off for most, I recommend Exodus as a lovingly crafted Indie effort put forth by a small team of folks.  It is quick and easy to pick up, but before buying it, check out their demo first!\n\n[Thanks go to Derek for gifting me this nice game.]","July 31, 2014","true","21.2"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","37","43","0","4"

I didn't and we'll come back to that, but let's pretend I did.  The very first thing I'm treated with is an unskippable cinematic (I use the term loosely) about something I have neither the patience nor emotional investment in to bother commiting to memory.  The cinematic looks like something a particularly talented teenager, or maybe a professional designer who has really under the pump and just flat out didn't care, might create.  It goes for so long that I had time to reflect on it's nature, and post to Twitter about how games can do many things that film cannot, but creating animated shorts of dubious quality is not one of them.  This is not hyperbole, this is something that actually happened.  And the unskippable cinematic that I didn't care about was still rolling.\n\nOkay, we can stop pretending now.  What I really did at the attract screen was select "Options" to make sure there wasn't anything selectied that would cause my five year old laptop to melt onto my thighs.  And also check out the controls.  I'm going to type this next bit in bold, because if there is only one part of this review anyone reads I want it to be this: move left and move right are mapped to the Q and D keys.  Jump is mapped to the Z key.  Every time you try to remap a key, the game crashes.  That's right, the game defaults to a hand-pretzel position for the three most basic functions of a platformer.  I've played guitar for 20 years; I'm used to working my hands into and out of pretzel positions, but no.  I am not going to play a game this way.  I dug around the game install directories for a config file or some such where I could manually configure the keys.  Yes, it's there, but instead of calling the keys by plaintext values they are called by decimal values.  At this point I decided that instead of remapping the keys this way, my time might be better spent plucking my nosehairs or throwing darts at the refrigerator.\n\nThis game might be completely awesome, and I will never no because it is basically unusable.  If you want to find out and don't mind dealing with hand cramps, be my guest.  Everyone else, just go buy a cup of coffee or something.  You'll get more out of it.","January 31, 2015","false","0.2"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","81","26","32","8","0"

It took 26 more tries (yes, I counted).\n\nSince then it has crashed multiple times. Two times it reverted to a save that was 30-45 minutes old.\n\nI'm going to leave the review as a thumbs up because it is a fun game, but you may want to wait for a patch unless you are ok with this.\n\n*** End Edit ***\n\nThis is not a full review, and I have to qualify it by saying that I have quit playing 4-5 hours in to it and probably won't play it any more.\n\nThings I liked:\n\n* Nice graphics.\n* Lots of skills.\n* Huge area to explore.\n* Controls are good, if maybe a bit floaty.\n\nThings I didn't like:\n\n* The save points are sometimes too far apart.\n* A couple of "cheap" tactics, like things falling on your head out of the darkness that you can't see to avoid.\n\nWhy I quit:\n\n(** mild spoiler **)\n\nMoving+rotating platforms inside of a laser maze. There is a section where you ride moving platforms through an insta-death laser-wall maze. The plaforms periodically flip over and the bottom side hurts you. This is not even close to fun for me. After a couple dozen attempts at this, I decided life was too short and put the game away.\n\n(** end spoiler **)\n\nTo be fair, I am, let's say, a "seasoned gamer" and may have lost my edge over the years. And I am certain my tolerance for frustration is lower than it used to be. If you have the patience for these types of things, there is a lot to like about the game. And it is certainly worth the price.","July 12, 2014","true","21.5"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","28","37","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whippywawa/recommended/313960/","Whippywawa","ANTI","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whippywawa/","71 products in account","Let me be completely honest here, this game feels unfinished.\nFrom the textures, to the loading screens, to the combat... it all feels a little out of date.\nBut... it's definitely worth the 5 dollars being asked for it. My favorite part of the entire game would have to be the music in it though, and if I could make a suggestion to the developers, have the soundtrack for sale, because really... it's WELL made.\nThe most downing thing about it is the combat, it's got the same problem as many other games like it... there's no feel of knockback or even hitting the creature. It's just you swipe and you hope that it does damage to whatever you're swiping at, and likewise for the hitboxes of your own character. There's just no FEEL of hitting or being hit. Obviously if you're going for a non-gory approach, you could have the character just explode into a field of those little... orb things that I can't remember the name of :L\nAnother thing is the talents/skills system: It's very cool, but at the same time, it's so completely generic. I like how the orbs can be used for practical purposes like double jump and attacking twice or sprinting, but when you have a tiny little increase like +20% health? It's just not even worth putting in the game... or you could make it +100% health but the curve increases dramatically.\nThe last thing is, you guessed it, the graphics and animations. The 3D look of the models gives a distinction between foreground and background entities, but not all things follow this distinction. An example I can think of is there's this kind of plant enemy which looks any other plant, in the background not looking suspicious at all, and yet it shoots at you. Heck it took me a bit to even realize what was shooting at me. Then there's the absolutely awful platforms and ground... It's so difficult to tell what can be stepped on and what can't in this game. Above all that though is the actual style of animation. It looks so bad it's like a little 6 year old was using a model maker for the first time. FOR THE RECORD THOUGH: I thoroughly enjoy the art of the backgrounds and the title screen and such; it's really well made.\n\nNow I know I'm recommending the game, but I'm doing it for the sole reason that I think it's worth the 5 dollars they're asking for it. If it were any more, say 10 dollars or something, I'd say no to this thing faster then a damn hedgehog on wheels :P","July 15, 2014","true","0.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astring/recommended/313960/","astring","every bae is halloween","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astring/","4250 products in account","I want you to read this before just assuming it's me praising the game. It's not something I would tell most people to buy, but there is a certain type of person who is going to be all over this.\n\nThe closest comparison I can make for this game is the Valley Without Wind series, but it's not nearly as deep (or interesting, if you ask me). This game is about ten times jankier, though. I ♥♥♥♥ you not, this game really feels like it was made by aliens, or some rudimentary AI with Game Maker or a similar creation toolset. The default controls include, and I am not kidding, Q to go left, D to go right, X to jump, and S to crouch. The text was clearly written in French and probably machine-translated for the English release. Massive amounts of the art assets don't match, with some being bright and pixellated, others being more subdued, and others still being 3D or a pastel style or... it's jarring, and makes it incredibly hard to tell what's a threat and what's environment until you've blundered into something. Bosses seem staggeringly untested - the first was a massive HP sponge whose health bar ticked down a single sliver at a time whenever I hit him in his weak spot, until he suddenly died about 1/3-1/2 into his bar in an explosion of health powerups. Similarly, my attack seemed to have a weird ghost-range on it, as did some enemies. That might have been due to the upgrade system though. Also, I'm just going to throw this out due to the genre it's in: don't make lava or some surfaces instakills. Plenty of this genre rewards slipping or taking a risk by letting you pit damage rates against your health and see if you can get a new powerup or some kind of item from it. This game just goes "screw off and lose your cash, sucker".\n\nHere, though, is why I am giving this a positive review and suggesting you try the demo to see if you're the target market: it's a Metroid clone with a bizarre tacked-on skill system and Souls-series-like currency for upgrades that you lose if you die but can regain if you get back to it... etc. Where it gets friggin' insane is the fact that things which you would expect to be powerups in any other game (double jump, health upgrades, dashing, etc.) are now skills on a tree which you spend your "energy" on. But then there are random powerups you find as you go, like a longer-range attack. There's also a choice of protagonist at the beginning of the game for some small tweaks in stats, although I didn't try the second to see if they had a different story. It's not like I was going to understand it in any way. (I cannot stress how poorly the game's English translation is handled. Multiple times it gave me directions or orders which were just entirely incorrect, if not opposite of the truth. Check your map, not the dialogue.) Some of you are going to see the issue in the above: this makes sequence-breaking or exploration something locked to grinding, given that a lot of your traversal powerups are locked behind massive gates of currency costs, and not your finding them.\n\nHere are things the game does well, however: save points double as fast-travel, the game allows you to leap from the air for more creative platforming at times, later upgrades on your skill tree like short-range teleportation or the jump height boost allow for early areas to become quick jaunts on revisits. I just wish that this was ported into a better title.","July 2, 2015","true","0.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

You explore an unknown world, gathering different kinds of powerups. Some instantly grant you new abilities (these are rare) while others act like experience and are used to unlock your skill trees.\n\nThere is also nice variety of game play. In the first three zones, you move from exploration, to dodging traps to navigating in the dark. There was never a moment of boredom.\n\nSo you know what to expect: Exodus is not a very forgiving game. It is not the enemies that are dangerous but the environmental hazards. You loose any unspent experience upon death. This experience waits at the location of your death, but if you die a second time before collecting it then it is lost permanently.\n\nSome users experience the game crashing upon launch. It is recommended that you download the demo first.\nI initially had trouble with this but the issue resolved itself after I updated windows.","November 22, 2014","true","1.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Didn't use much else for conveyance after that. It took quite a while before I put energy into any skill tree that would make me a better fighter, but enemies can be skipped mostly and do not yield as much energy as exploration. Early bosses are doable without combat skills and the fights themselves are pretty interesting. Some felt like a bullet hell at times, or just hell. I cheated against that secret boss by teleporting back to a checkpoint. It took a long time. Trying legitimately I never got past its second phase.\n\nIn the very final area, if I went from the bottom east to the bottom west the background would suddenly become black and my character and enemies would be flickering and if I kept walking I would fall through the floor eventually without being able to teleporthax back, so I lost some progress there. I tried it three times, and it happened every time. Going west to east was fine though. The screen also froze randomly at times for a few seconds but that has been happening with everything I do lately so.. yeah. If this happened in mid-air however, even the slightest jump would hurt like a fall from heaven.\n\nThe grammar is weird, and occasionally the spelling is wrong too. It was consistent enough for me to start thinking it was a trait of the protagonists race or something.","July 16, 2014","true","13.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I thought it would be a fun little explore-the-world and gain-new-abilities Metroidvania type deal, which it is, but only by technicality, I suppose... also, minus the fun part. I found the whole atmospheric feel, that other games of its kind have, was killed by mediocre animation, clunky physics, poor spelling and grammar (a definite annoyance for people like me), and absolutely deplorable controls; some of the worst I've ever laid my hands on.\n\nI decided that the lack of gamepad compatibility was something I could work around with button mapping software. After spending a decent amount of time figuring out a configuration that worked for me, I was ready to go.  I found myself wandering aimlessly for a bit, finally started making progress, experienced an in-game crash, and beat the first boss. I found myself bored by the experience. But the big thing that made me decide to abandon this game was when I realized that you needed the mouse to aim projectiles at enemies and, therefore, using a gamepad wasn't a very good option.\n\nLack of fun factor aside, the game has some pretty graphics, albeit with varying artistic styles of different objects that clash quite abraisively. It also has some decent music. All-in-all, the merits are too few for me to recommend this game. If you're looking for a 2d platformer with exciting areas to explore and crazy powerups, there are much better, more fun games out there. Even for a seemingly rushed indie game, this one is just bad. Very disappointing.","October 3, 2015","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
