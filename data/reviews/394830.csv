The puzzles can sometimes be incredibly easy but then just as quickly become quite a challenge. Some puzzles require you to have to run back to the beginning to complete areas but my favorite little thing about this game is that sometimes you have to take damage to keep pushing forward. In this puzzle game light is your enemy whether it be natural or beaming from an electrical mount on the wall so you have to be crafty to avoid sources of light by either triggering things that may block the light or hiding behind boxes and timing your next move. You won't die as soon as you are hit by light but you will be significately slowed down until you either escape or succumb to death from light! I definitely recommend this game for puzzle fans!\n\nI did a lets play of the first few levels if you'd like to see some game play in action:\nhttps://youtu.be/vtSaATnl4Xw","February 26","true","0.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

How you have to block light to get past corridors works really well. The mechanics are great, too. I like the way they teach you about them aswell. It starts out kinda slow but after 2 or 3 levels it gets better and more difficult. Worth every penny!","February 28","true","3.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's a fantastic premise and even better execution.
