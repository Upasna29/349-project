If you still want to buy the game after reading this, there's a really good chance you'll enjoy it.\n\nYou may enjoy this game if:\n* you like co-op action/RPGs or games similar to Monster Hunter or Phantasy Star Online (PSO)\n* looking for a feudal / ancient Japanese themed setting\n* have a game pad or don't mind playing with keyboard without a mouse\n* have an existing group of friends playing this game for multiplayer co-op\n* do not mind playing in full-screen\n* do not mind playing with capped frame rate of 30 FPS\n* appreciate a well-rounded soundtrack\n* don't mind payng full game cost (at the time of this review)\n\nDo NOT get this game if:\n* (Partial Addressed as of 7/6) if you have any of the "problematic" hardware or software (may want to check the discussion boards here to see what those have been) as you may be troubleshooting or reconfiguring your hardware just to play this one game\n* you're hoping for an seamless multiplayer interface as it is a lobby-based interface that requires a player to be idle in a lobby for you to join (cannot play a mission, cannot select a mission, cannot be crafting.)\n* no automatic refresh or join on the lobby system, either create a lobby and wait around or manual refresh to find a compatible game\n* you use keyboard and mouse, because the game cannot reassign actions to the mouse (if the reverse happened, where a PC port to console required you to use a keyboard/mouse to enjoy the game, I suspect many console gamers would not be pleased that their primary interaction method is not supported)\n* you like to play in windowed mode and have a decent framerate -- the game speed is literally tied to frame rate, so a steady frame rate of 20 FPS means 66% gameplay speed\n* you like to play games at 60 FPS and run at normal gameplay speed (Omega Force had the DW6 port for PC capable of running at 60 FPS in 2008)\n* would like to use the keyboard to chat with people you meet, input names or notes -- you have to use the game's UI to select one letter at a time\n* would like to look up the Steam name of someone you meet to chat with them there, because there doesn't seem to be a way yet -- use the preprogrammed messages in the game instead\n* you would like an English dub or even English subtitles for the "battle cries," -- neither exist and I don't think they will\n* do not like a UI that does not move if you move too fast through it\n* if you would like to customize your face by eye style, eye color, nose style, mouth style, chin style, or facial hair -- you have 1 of 20 pre-configured faces per gender to choose from and possibly only two with facial hair that does not reflect your hair color\n* if you want other body types per gender -- as you cannot be a slim ninja, a short rifleman, or a hulking hammer wielding warrior, you all have the same body size\n\nMinor things I personally don't like on top of the above:\n* animation locks and slow animations can make combat feel not as fluid as Dynasty Warriors 8 (a Tecmo Koei game)\n* segmented maps with multiple loading screens during a mission\n* (7/6 update) frame rate dips in full screen have been rare these days\n\nThings I do like:\n* the music\n* the Japanese era-like setting\n* story character portraits\n* used to like forcing V-Sync on the GPU and running at 60 FPS even if the game speed is doubled ~ actually feels more fluid (accidentally ran with V-Sync off and the game was running 200+ FPS ~ could not even select Continue) (7/6 Update) this is no longer a possibility with the current executable and is far more stable across my three machines\n* variety of bosses to fight\n* variety of combat styles and configurations\n* the ability to hide helmet on most armor styles\n* hoping senpai will notice me in the hot springs\n* no crashes on primary machine yet\n\nThe store page game summary reflects single-player gameplay elements and story well enough.\n\nConclusion as of July 2, 2015):\nI saw the negative reviews in the most helpful section and could not find a positive review for many pages so I looked at the positive reviews only.  I was cautiously optimistic for what looked like a "samurai" themed co-op action RPG.  Some may wonder, "You have a lot of hours clocked in and it works for you, why don't you recommend it?  I don't understand."  In terms of the game working for me, I feel like I happen to be lucky.  I typically don't feel lucky with these pre-2012 machines, but it's like this game was made for it (and that's bad in 2015.)  At first I tried to give the game at least three hours to give my review some weight and then once I was past the reasonable refund point, I felt obligated to get my money's worth.  I'm also starved for this niche atmosphere with RPG elements.  The gameplay is a 3 out of 5 stars for me with co-op tipping it upward.\n\nI probably dialed my expectations back to 2007, because when I think about things we've seen in other games these past fews years: separation of character face options, the ability to dye clothing, drop-in and drop-out co-op, responsive controls, KB/M support (look at almost any 3rd person action game for working examples), the list goes on.  And then I realized how much potential the game doesn't tap into, but even before that, some basic PC features aren't addressed properly.  Even the "console expectation," that the game will work right out of the box is not an unreasonable expectation.  Even still, there's a few things that would nudge this game into the recommended / thumbs up side:\n\n* Keyboard and Mouse support\n* Improved PC optimization\n* Support for 60 FPS\n\nIn general, if Koei addressed those three points above on top of not cutting out features found in console versions, I believe that TK could prevent most of the negative reviews (and probably get a lot more sales out of not just this game, but their other products as well.)  Please consider this for the future TK.","June 29, 2015","false","91.7"," 523 of 632 people (83%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","83","523","632","20","25"

I pretty much guessed it will be buggy and pricey. so I grabbed it 6 months later after patches were made. at 50% off.\n\nBuy this game if:\n+You like Japanese setting\n+You like monster hunter\n\nDo not buy this game if:\n-You don't have controller\n-You only have low end PCs\n-You don't want 30fps\n-You expect an English voice over\n\nPerformance: 7/10 (for my rig)\nThis is a good game, but not so good port. If you play using keyboard, it'll be really uncomfortable especially if you haven't played any monster hunter games. I had to use "Joy To Key" in order to have my PC controller work, It's sad that I had to rely on third party program but I still enjoyed the game. I had to play with the settings and graphics card settings a little bit to get the best result I can get. So if you expect to play it right away, you might get disappointed. I am giving this a positive review because the game performance is working perfectly to me other than the controller support and the game itself is pretty good. don't hate my review just because it's not working for you, that's why you have your review, and I have mine.\n\nGameplay: 7/10\nIt is monster hunter. period. just slightly different mechanics with MH.\nbefore the edit, this is what I said in the review:\n"This is more easier than any of the monster hunter game, you can take your time picking up loots while your NPC party pretty much beat up every monster in the game and then "Mission Accomplished". I'm not against about party, but I don't feel good enough when slaying bosses because it's not giving you any monster hunter sensation like few mistakes could affect the entire battle. Gameplay is Monster hunter with smash button."\nIt really is easy as pie for the first few chapters, but the real challenge starts in chapter 6, where the mission will actually give you some thrill. I would give it 8.5 rating for the gameplay, but the fact that this is copied from monster hunter kind of affected its originality. so it deserves a 7.\n\nStory: 8/10\nIf it comes with plot and story, I think this is where Toukiden beats Monster Hunter. It gives you more pressure or urgency to go forward to find out what's gonna happen next. pretty solid turn of events, every protagonist has their own story and challenges to overcome. Each one has too much worries, pride, anger, regret, guilt, and insecurities that even a physically strong person can be mentally weak.\n\nArt: 7/10\nIs good. Character designs are remarkable.\nthis is what I said before the edit: "Atmosphere is okay but it looks dense to me especially the backgrounds, it looks low poly and textures are lazy. They spent a lot of time on characters, monster and items, but fk the backgrounds in particular."\nIt is still kind of true, but I've come to notice that polygons aren't so bad for the backgrounds. it's just the textures, lacks of contrast and resolution. the desert looks pretty good though. so, yeah, Characters are remarkable but fk the backgrounds in particular.\n\nSound and Voice: 9/10\nThey hired the most talented VAs, It's in Japanese but I'd prefer it 10 times over a not so good English. Music is great, fits the setting perfectly.\n\nOver all: 7.6/10 (7.5 before edit)\n\nI am happy with the game. Great game but not so good port. If it wasn't for controller support and performance tweak, I could have given it higher review.\nfor those who are wanting a mouse support for this game, the game would easy as a kids game(It's already the easy version of MH, what more do you want), hence, unfair for console version of the game. you know who complains about mouse support? someone who probably hasn't played any rpg game in console or FPS pc gamer.\nI like the way it is now.","January 5","true","83.4"," 79 of 91 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","79","91","4","6"

It is a direct PS4 port, which means the keyboard and mouse support is non-existent. If you want fluid gameplay on the PC, you'll need to find a way to use a console gamepad on the PC. The online game play has its own problems, monsters are out of sync with other players, more often than not you will see your allies swinging mindlessly at nothing. You will only experience this problem if you can even find an online lobby.\n\nThere is no communication options with other players besides pre-set messages that you have to scroll through a menu for. If you are lucky enough to have an enjoyable time experience this game in a random lobby with other players, there is no options to add fellow Slayers on Steam. In addition to this, the online game hub is very limited, it's a message board room where you can pick up missions, quests, and change equipment. If you want to do any sort of gear upgrade, you must leave the online lobby into single player mode to craft items. You risk losing your place with a possibly very good Slayer party.\n\nThere is no way of playing with friends on your Steam friends list, unless you live close enough to one another and you just happen to find the other person's lobby when searching online. I tested this with a friend of mine from Hong-Kong and it was not going to happen. We created games with passwords, and there was no way of finding or joining one another's lobbies.\n\nThere are, however, positives, not many, but they are there. The game is fun if you can get into a lobby with other fellow Slayers who know what they are doing and are competent. The 30 frame-rate cap is not as big of a problem as all people are making it out to be, the game is pretty, the 30 frames is very playable. The removal of the cap would be a huge improvement for the experience though.  The gameplay is nice and polished, no graphical glitches, no gameplay glitches thus far.\n\nFor $60, and the immensely poor optimization, the game is not worth your money. Save your money until the game is patches and fixes these basic issues. Considering that it is not playable as a PC port, I will not recommend this game to anyone as of yet.\n\nI will recommend this game to the die hard fans out there looking for a Monster Hunter equivalent on PC. If you have a console game controller and know how to use it with your PC, definitely give it a go, the game is fully playable with a console controller.

Still 30 fps but its better than playing it on the Vita.\n\nNot worth $60 if thats your main question.\n\nEdit 2: Ive been playing it for a while now. Yay and the game is great. I'll be leaving my review up like this so people can actually see there was a problem and why im not recommending it.\n\nGameplay: 7/10\n\nThe game is fun. If you been waiting for a monster hunter game on PC this is it!\n\nPort: 5/10\n\nEverything is just how you will find in most ports. No mouse control, 30 fps, bearly any visual upgrades if any. Its just not right to keep selling old games that run worse though.\n\nPrice: $60/30\n\nI think the game should sell for 30. Not because its a bad port, but because the game is old and its not optimized for pc. Here's a list of $60 features on pc.\n\nTons of Resolutions.\nNo fps cap.\nMouse/Keyboard support.\n\nIf you want a Monster Hunter on steam and are willing to cash out $60 go for it. Just be ready to use windows 7 compatability mode.\n\nIf you want the game but its too expensive add to wishlist and wait on sale.\n\nIf you never tried this type of game. Add to wishlist and wait on sale. Its a great game.\n\nIf you're mad because of the fps lock dont buy it.","June 26, 2015","false","28.8"," 157 of 211 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","157","211","3","0"

Nothing i did fixed a considerably crippling issue in the character selection screen, whereby the character model simply wasnt there. all i had left was a pair of eyeballs, some hair, and a few phantom clothes floating there and staring back at me.

Its in most of there games would have really enjoyed cranking mission 1 on intense difficulty and feeling that pressure.\n- Scoreboards even if not online but just for yourself, it would have been glorious going back to old levels and trying to beat old times set when you was weak.\n- Actually character leveling, the weapons and amour is a nice way to level but would of added some more depth if we could pick add +2 to defense or attack if our base character leveled up but still not a massive issue.\n- English dub, im all cool reading the story but it is a little bit lazy leaving it out but if this is the only way Koei can re-release these things on pc then im all good with that.\n\nOverall\n\nIts an addictive just 1 more hunt sort of game, once you fight your first epic oni you just cant wait to see what the next one could be.

I also had to replay the first mission about 5 times because it kept crashing on the first level transition.\n\nCombat is very similar to Dynasty Warriors 8, only without the satisfaction that comes from levelling entire armies. There's no passive lock-on like you would experience in other character action games, so manually locking on is a necessity when fighting one-on-one, otherwise you are liable to miss your opponent entirely, or slide past them halfway through a combo. Normally that wouldn't be a problem, but you need to hold the lock on button for a second or two before it will actually lock onto an enemy, and there's no way to quickly switch between targets (at least that I've found).\n\nI wasn't able to get very deep into the other mechanics of the game (see above with the crashing issues) but I suspect they are quite simplistic. Koei Techmo has a habit of making interesting gameplay mechanics, but not taking them far enough (looking at you, Empires).\n\nOverall, I doubt this game would be worth the full price, even if it ran properly on PC. I wouldn't recommend it until the technical problems are fixed and the game goes on sale.","June 26, 2015","false","1.6"," 70 of 97 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","70","97","2","0"

On one hand, Tecmo is known for over-the-top, unforgivingly fast paced games like the Ninja Gaiden series and cheesecake/beefcake heavy fighting franchise Dead or Alive, while Koei is best known as a publisher of borderline educational and contemplative "historic simulation" strategy games, such as Nobunaga's Ambition, with some forays into action like the Samurai Warriors series.\nWhen the planets align just right and both heads on that ogre manage fuse their respective interests juuuust right, you might just end up with a game like Toukiden.\nTo spite being accused of, "just being a clone of Monster Hunter," Toukiden has a number of strong differences, both cosmetic and functional. The combat is *far* more straight-forward, centering around direct action sequences and easier to approach equipment and movement sets. This is probably the influence of the Tecmo head of the ogre. From the Koei head, however, we have a setting and visual motif that are influenced by classical Japanese mythology and history.\nThe end result is a system familiar to players of Capcom's Monster Hunter games, but wholly different in many key respects. Gone is the need to stop partway into key battles to resharpen weapons and chow down a hotdog to avoid exhastion, along with the cumbersone inventory management system. Still here, however, are the fights including foes of massive scale, the limb-damaging and severing mechanic, and the collection of specified enemy part drops to manufacture weapons and armor.\nKoei's head of the ogre did have one more interesting word on the matter. Toukiden employs significant historical and mythological figures as equippable "Mitama," sort of a guardian spirit, which change the support spells and buffs that the player has. Each of Toukiden's playable zones are based on one or more specific era or "Age," in Japan's history, and hosts notable Mitama from the corresponding ages. The character designs also do that strange Koei-Tecmo thing, where they just barely split the difference between modern and classical fashion. Not many women showing off tons of cleavage, though, as one might expect.\nThe bottom line is that, somehow, all of this comes together and *works.* And it works surprisingly well. Some hardened Monster Hunter players will definitely complain that Toukiden lacks gameplay-complicating features like hunger and weapon degradation, but I feel as though the game is better without such distractions. The two-heade ogre certainly thinks so.","February 15","true","11.0"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","19","24","0","0"

The entire Mitama system of Spirits and their special abilites adds a lot of choices and ways to augment the game to your playstyle too!\nOr how monsters usually have more than half a dozen breakable locations that impact play, and leave parts on the ground for you to try to collect (or else risk the monster healing a bit if you don't get them in time).\n\n--Quality of Life Changes--\n\nThere are numerous quality of life changes like a WAY easier time gathering materials (no more farming the same monster 50 or 60 times to get that last rare drop).\n\nOne of the best changes is the Slayer vision, a sight mode you can turn on that drains your stamina (used for dodging and attacking) but reveals how damaged different monster parts are -- showing how close they are to being knocked off for harvesting (or carves in MH... though way more often than carves). This vision also shows you total monster health so you can always check if you're close to killing it or have a while to go and can focus on getting a few more parts. (Making this have a direct drawback of reducing your ability to attack and dodge is a nice counter balance in their design so players can't use it all the time)\n\nThere's lots of little changes to help, like not having to pick up the map as you enter the area, not having to waste time or money on paintballing things or chasing it between zones to deal with it. It's more focused on the fun of the combat when you're out on a hunt.\n\nYou also get an adorable fox creature that you can send off to scavange areas for you to find crafting items. Later in the game you also get command of a second squad to send out to farm monster materials for you as well!\n\nAdditionally, in MH, you could end up being screwed by having a weird party size, three people ended up being worse than solo because you lost access to the cats. This game fixes issues like that by letting you take AI party members with you (who have real stories and are interesting characters in their own right). OR you can choose to go it alone and not take them with you if you'd rather not!\n\n--Difficulty--\n\nOne reviewer called this game "too easy" which, as a long time Souls and Monster hunter fan, I disagree with. I'd say it's approachable early on, but anyone who's played Monster Hunter knows that the begining of the game monsters are just the warm up, if you're interested in harder things, keep going to get higher tier monsters and armor and higher level versions of creatures. Like in MH there's 3 different difficulties for most monsters, and some monsters don't appear in earlier points in the game! Just remember that you only have to do the missions written in *Red* to progress to the next chapter. You don't have to do every single hunt to continue in the story or get to higher tier enemies and things (but you can always come back later if you want to)\n\n--Story--\n\nLastly, the storyline is a lot more interesting and engaging than one would ever expect coming from the Monster Hunter series. You feel like you've been dropped into an anime series where you're a principle character engaging with these interesting people and finding out about their strengths, flaws, interpersonal interactions, learning their quirks... and you progress towards a real goal that seems important and pushes and tests the characters involved to grow and become better people.\n\n--Porting--\n\nThis game gets a lot of flak for porting issues, and I think a lot of the problems arise based on people using Windows 10. That said, Dark Souls 1 had horrendous porting issues too, and while that was an issue for some, it didn't stop people from enjoying the game. Dark Souls still has great reviews because people were willing to see past the port and rate it based on the GAME itself.\n\nIf you choose not to play this because of percieved porting issues, you're cutting off your nose to spite your face, you're missing out on a great experience for what might be a minor inconcenience -- I haven't found any issues with porting myself and think a lot of the whining comes from the "OMFG 60 FPS or GTFO" crowd. Most of us don't see the difference or care when it doesn't affect play.","May 9","true","53.9"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","2"

Just try out if you can play it properly and, if not, refund it before you played more than 2 hours, but don't expect to get a deep insight to the game in those 2 hours.\n\nEnglish is not my first language, sorry.\n\nI'm playing with a friend and we are in the Coop-Chapter 14-15 right now. At first the game was easy (but sometimes hard too, we're just into these games) enough to be played alone or as two hunters only, but later the ultimate-difficulty is pretty cool if you're looking for some more action, especially with those newer monsters. Reaching that point you should consider to play with the really good bots the game offers or some more friends ... or you will have very, very tough fights, foremost if you want to beat some of the special-missions and survivals with more than 20 killed big monsters. Also you should practise to dodge attacks, because many of them will hurt you very much or even onehit you when you're playing as a glasscannon.\n\nThe story of Toukiden is not that bad and I really liked the dialogues & the characters - no problems with some stereotypes from my side here. Especially Toukiden: Kiwami (the Addon) tries to be more cinematic and changes the town a bit more, but I didn't finish the story yet so I can't and won't say more.\n\nIf you're looking for a 1:1-Monster Hunter-clone, you don't find it here. The focus of Toukiden is the bossfight itself, not the hunt. You won't place traps and lure the big monsters et cetera, because they will wait for you - ready for battle - most of the times, and I don't think that's even bad.\n\nEach of the 9 available weapons feels very different in combat and can be played for damage & crit, elemental damage or special effects like DoT or CC. Well, most of the costumization for your playstyle lies in the choice of your Mitama: These noble souls will have different abilities for you to use, like teamsupport or speciality in destroying of the monster's bodyparts, and later on you can combine three of them to form your own playstyle with. There are 300 of them to get and each of them has a little backroundstory (actually real persons like in Samurai Warriors/Dynasty Warriors) and a different japanese voice & picture. Not sure if anyone else likes to collect interesting stories and nice artworks while getting new possibilites in the game too, but I like it.\n\nWell, I like this game alot, but you should rather play it with a friend than alone, because some parts are - that's a part of this genre anyway - grind-intensive, even more later on. The less you grind new armors and weapons, the more you will get into trouble if you skip missions to enter new chapters ... I mean: Of course you can do that, but don't expect not to be a onehit for everyone then! Generally the weapons will have a much higher impact on your chances of success than armor, as long as you can dodge.","May 7","true","168.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

It's a great alternative if you don't want to buy a whole new system for one game.\n\nCompared to Monster Hunter (MH)\n-Toukiden: Kiwami has a more basic gameplay (no sharpning weapons mid fight, no tagging the monster, npcs to help most of the time[optinal]) --this can be good or bad based on your gameplay likes--\n-This game is less grindy and less rng based ( you have many other ways to get matierals, your Tenko, the Guadrian Tree, a second party to send out while on your own mission)\n-This game also has a far better story then MH, which has been my only compaint about MH\n\nYou should enjoy this game if you like:\n-Monster Hunter\n-Hack N Slash games\n-Japanese based Sci-fi.\n-Awsome looking weapons and weapon collecting (I've always had the habbit(obsession) of doing this in RPGs)\n\nPlay Time\nIt took me about 20 hours to complete the base story of the game(chaters 1-5), with very little matieral or Mitama farming. After Chapter 5 you can do other more challenging missions and Infinite Missions, as well as collect weapons, armor, Mitama. There are also DLC, which i dont own yet, that should add even more game play time.\n\nCombat\nNothing special, but a good hack n' slash system. Likely more advanced then basic hack n slash games.\n\nStroy\nA basic story of portect the village and kill the monsters, but Toukiden: Kiwami has very good character developement.\n\nMusic\nSimple traditional Japanese instramental music. But its fits the setting of the maps very well.\n\nThings some players may not like\n-REAQUIRES a controller to play\n-locked at 30 fps\n-optional DLC\n\nThis is a port of a console game so some people disslike the port, but I've had very few issues personally. No keyboard support, no proper way to close the game short of alt+tab (that I know of) and my headphone volume locks to the volume set at launch.","March 28","true","28.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The only one difference is that Monster Hunter is challenging while Toukiden is easy as hell. This is a good copy of Monster Hunter but the lack of challenge is disappointing.\n\nThe port itself is really bad :\n-Loading screens (haven't been waiting loading screens from 1 to 3 mins since years and the game is installed on a Western Digital Black SATA 6Gb/s drive)\n-The game crashes often if you don't play the game in Windows 7 compatibility mode\n-30 FPS lock (no fix available because of the game engine, if you force 60 fps the game speed will be very fast)\n-Blurry as hell if you don't turn the "depth of field" graphic option on "low" setting\n\nNote :\nYou need a controller to play this game, don't try to play this with a keyboard.

The whole game is set in a version of feudal Japan whose timeline has been distorted and land twisted up by the Oni, the demons of Japanese folklore. Though many will call Toukiden a Monster Hunter *clone*, it feels more apt to call it a Monster Hunting *game*. It's very different from Monster Hunter and in a good way.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/TzRZMP3w8y0\n\n+ Mitamas = Spirits of historical figures of feudal Japan. Load them into your weapons. Get stat boosts/special abiulities. Using Mitamas to create your own unique loadout is gratifying. Bonuses for using Mitamas historically related to one another. Incentive to play around with different combinations. TONS of bonus effects.\n\n+ Gathering items to create consumables has been replaced by stock powers that do the same things as Potions, Antidotes, Cool Drinks, etc. and then some! Your abilities change depending on the type of Mitama you have equipped. Less prep work, more demon fighting.\n\n+ Great weapon choices and fighting styles. Each weapon plays a little differently than the other. Skill plays a moderate factor in the combat; the better you know how to use your weapon, the better slayer you are.\n\n- (I'm coming off of MH4U's almost-G-Rank HR stuff) Monster AI is a little too dumb in the beginning, and by the beginning I mean SEVERAL hours. Probably only highlighted by the fact that teammate AI in the single player campaign is VERY good. Monster AI does get smarter at a much faster rate than the teammate AI, so it balances out, but be prepared for some lazy demons early on.\n\n- The PC Port comes at a rocky recommendation as the multiplayer apparently has issues, but if you're still interested in a strong solo Monster Hunting experience this is definitely something you should give a go.\n\n\n","January 27","true","63.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The gameplay is simpler and eventually it feels less challenging. I did not find any issues in the locked framerate and performance as I'm accustomed to console experience for these types of games. Definitely if you have a friend that wants to play with you, not worth full price. I enjoyed this at a discount.","January 3","true","69.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The one and only task is to protect humans (and Tenko) from Oni.\nCharacter's appearance and starting weapon are customizable. New weapon and armor can be purchased from merchants or crafted from Oni parts. Mitama (spirits of historical figures or fictional characters) determine character's class and abilities. Mitama can be obtained from defeated Oni only.\nThe process of slaying a large Oni starts with destroying its body parts (legs, tails, etc.), then purifying those parts (otherwise the Oni regenerates it) then attacking the Oni true form (transparent, blue or purple). Oni's behavior changes during battle.\nAI companions are adequate and helpful. Chapters and Phases are similar, but the former is Offline Story mode, while the latter is Online mode.\nGraphics, sound (warning, there's no English VA) and controls (customizable key bindings) are fine.","January 27","true","49.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Toukiden: Kiwami takes a few\nnotes from the format of Monster Hunter and improves upon them. You've got access to a great amount of weapons that are\nall very interesting in thier own ways, which is where Toukiden shines. At this game's core, it is an action RPG with\nmore focus on the action part.\n\nWhen you drop yourself into a mission, you're able to move freely, loot items you find and either engage or dodge enemies\nas you choose. More often than not you're going to be after a specific enemy or set of enemies, so you'll be fighting\nsomething. Just as expected, with any Monster Hunter experience, you will be put up against large scale monsters that are\nvery dangerous. This is the meat and potatoes of the game.\n\nEvery large monster has body parts that can be removed and mechanic changes that occur as you remove more and more limbs.\nAs you remove limbs you also loot (or purify as this game calls it) said body parts. You also gain parts as rewards for\nkilling the monsters, removing some limbs or all limbs as quest rewards. You take these body parts and use them to craft\nnew weapons and armor to further expand your access to elements that can help you take on monsters with greater ease, or\nin new interesting ways.\n\nAs stated before, as you purify removed limbs there are ghost limbs that become visible. These are how you actually defeat\nlarge scale monsters. You have to remove the limbs, purify them and then gain access to the actual lifebar of the boss.\nOn a basic level the removal of limbs is basically just like breaking off armor exposing the true body.\n\nOnce you begin crafting, you'll see with time that there are tons of items to make and collect. You will end up finding\nyouself wanting to craft everything but never having the resorces to do it, creating an excitement every time you get\nsomething new and driving you to keep playing.\n\nSouls of fallen warriors will be items you will come across in the game that give you more interesting ways to customize\nyour character's loadout. With each soul comes a set of abilities that really change the way you play be it giving you\nmore stamina, a shield allowing you to wail away at an enemy or buffs to help out your whole party.\n\nThere is a story mode that provides a story interesting enough to keep you going with purpose, but not enough to really\ncome running to your friends wanting to talk about. It's just enough, but nothing special.\n\nToukiden does have a level of difficulty present, but if you use the in-game AI assistants you're going to ruin your\nexperience if you're interested in challenge. The AI totally breaks the game and makes it so easy you really don't even\nneed to play. The AI will do everything for you. The AI seem a little too powerful for thier own good too. As they should\nhave just been there as minor assistance and destraction, they do so much more with thier overpowered gear.\n\n::Pros::\n-Very interesting weapon mechanics\n-Weapons are very different allowing you to play in different styles to keep the game fresh\n-solo difficulty is really fun\n-online mode accessable for co-op fun with friends\n-tons of equipment to collect (for completionists)\n-Souls create more depth in creating a fun and unique way to play each time\n\n::Cons::\n-AI is way too good\n-AI use makes game way too easy\n-a little slow at first\n-game searching is a little inconvenient\n-online lobby is odd and limits your ability to craft\n\nGames like Toukiden are designed in a way that speak to a more specific crowd. If you like collecting items and like\ngames that can be grindy at times, Toukiden may be a great addition to your library. I would say that fans of action\ngames in general could probably get into and appreciate this game as well. If you're a player who likes things to always\nbe fresh and not recycled like playing in the same zones or fighting the same enemies over and over again, than this\ngame will not be for you. A warning to fans of Monster Hunter would be that this game is far far more forgiving and\ncontants a diffculty/skill curve that isn't quite so extreme, but the game makes up for it other ways. If the difficulty\nof Monster Hunter is what you play for then you may be at risk buying this game, so I would suggest getting it on sale.","May 5","true","23.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Stay FAR away from ANY game that was ported from a non-PC platform to PC. Also, stay away the ported game's guides/walkthroughs/tutorials, because they're all gonna probably be referencing the controller keys instead of the keyboard keys too.\n\nCAPCOM did it this way with DMC3SE LONG ago and nobody complained - in fact, back in those days many of the crazy-fast combo maniacs that you often see in youtube dmc3 videos used keyboards and not controllers of any sort, simply because it was relatively easier to jump cancel in quick succession with a keyboard than with a controller.\n\nSeriously, I don't see what the big deal is that could come from just taking 10 minutes to learn to set-up keyboard controls to mimic a controller, and THEN learning to memorize your own keyboard setup. All this 'controls learning' is a moot point if you already own an xbox/ps controller though.\n\nAll that being said, I do NOT recommend you start playing WITHOUT first rebinding the keys to something that feels natural for you relative to a controller layout (I rebound only 4 keys in total to feel like old dmc3 controls, and also having Q,E,F,R as default camera controls is just a bonus in my opinion, because in DMC3 I don't recall being able to rebind camera controls away from the arrow keys).\n\nMouse support?\nOh and before I forget, those of you complaining about the lack of mouse controls - where would you put the 4 attack/dodge functions tied to the keys for your right hand onto the mouse?\n\nSure, you could put dodge somewhere on the left hand (say.. Z key) and then you're left with the 3 attack functions - just nice for 3 mouse keys/clicks right? Wrong.\n\nAs a naginata/gauntlet user you end up having to spam your middle mouse button for your Special Attacks(circle key on PS4) - I'd instantly switch back to the keyboard just because of this.\n\nYes, games like Vindictus did it, but they didn't have a 3rd attack key. There were only L and R combos (left click and right click).\n\nIndie game devs like the Japanese folks at Zenith Blue had the right idea - look at their Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae game.\n\nIn summary, lack of mouse functionality is less a technical 'problem' and more of a game design constraint:\n\nWould you rather have 2 attack buttons (with combo variations limited by 2 keys) and precise camera controls with a mouse? (i.e. like Vindictus)\n\nOR would you rather have 3 (or more) attack buttons (with a LOT more combo variations/combat scenarios) on the keyboard and 4 keys controlling camera movement (with adjustable speed)?\n\nIf you prefer stuff like Vindictus, then play Vindictus.. or wait for games like Black Desert Online.\n\n30 FPS CAP oh god what do i do i can't 360 noscope with this\nPlease note that Toukiden Kiwami on PC has a hard framerate cap of 30 frames per second; hardcoded framerate == if you were to increase it, you end up hastening the game's physics cycles (i.e. time itself goes faster).\n\nMy opinion on the framerate cap is this - I can see it, I know it's bad/ugly, but I don't care; the game still responds quickly to my input regardless of the FPS cap and I'm able to time my dodges and parries with the same accuracy as what games like DMC4SE and DMC3SE has allowed me (look up DMC royal guard just guards and just releases, this is what you will do with the naginata and hammer counter-attack in Toukiden Kiwami - hint: that's your square+x attack).\n\nIn short, the game is framerate capped, but still responds instantly to your input regardless. If it doesn't your PC probably isn't beast enough to play this stuff.\n\nThe game won't start/crashes too much\nI personally didn't get a single problem from the start of playing this game. Mind you I'm on Win7x64 running an i7 4790K along with a GTX 760 card running on 350.12 drivers (these drivers were released for GTA V), so your mileage may vary.\n\nNow, with all that technical jazz aside, I can start talking about how much I love this game compared to the standard Monster Hunter games that came before this.\n\nWhat I like about this game\nIt's monster hunter on PC, what more need I say?\nThe story - stories that each NPCs have, along with the ties to the main story and the bonds created with the player (Monster Hunter: what story? WHAT NPC STORY? LOL)\nNPCs you can bring into battle to fight for you (and issue separate orders) and revive you\nDating sim-esque dialogues with said NPCs, along with bath house rewards ;)  (MH: WHAT DIALOGUES?)\nThe soundtrack (okay, MH and this one ties on soundtrack awesomeness in my opinion)\nThe graphics/visuals - they're around DMC4's standards, so that's goooooood\nPet tenko\nThe lack of stupid paintballs and having to chase cowardly monsters halfway across the frickin' map.*\nThe lack of stupid weapon sharpness maintenance and whetstones (and durability maintenance)*\nThe lack of stupid potion/food crafting to maintain stamina/hp (HP/Stam bars do NOT degrade over time, and you're given about an average of 10 heals per game that are replenishable with prayer stones scattered across the map)*\nThe lack of stupid fixed vertical camera angles that were widespread in standard MH games*\n*Note: If you like the last 4 points, then good for you - stick with Monster Hunter.\n\nWhat I DON'T like about this game\nThat frickin' expensive price tag (but if you factor in the amount of content and Japanese lore they put into this game, even I'd be hesitant to put it anything below about 20 USD, but 50 USD? ..Damn)\nSlight bit of grind required to obtain mats to craft a full set of new armor, but hell I can't complain if they made the game fun to play (weapons like dual knives and naginata is pretty damn repetitive so they don't count as 'fun' - look at chain and sickle if you want my perception of fun)\n~200 mitamas, each has 4 buffs when maxed, and you can equip 3 mitamas at higher weapon levels, then there's the bathhouse buffs, and the prayer box buff, armor buff, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ALL THIS THINKING HURTS - I'm just kidding it can take awhile to plan your endgame buffs is all\nLike MH, you still need to reference wikis and google sheets to know what materials drop where and how to obtain them and which parts to break\nSince I take no issue with the controls or the 30FPS cap 'port problems', I'd have to recommend this game, but ONLY if you're filthy rich (or single) and can afford a 50 USD hit to your wallet.\n\nOtherwise, wait for summer/christmas sales or some random weekend or Koei Tecmo sale (good luck with that - it took quite awhile for Dynasty Warriors 8 Xtreme Legends to go on sale that's more than -33%, lol).\n\nHappy hunting!","August 11, 2015","true","95.3"," 19 of 39 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","19","39","0","0"

However as a video game like this in 2015, a 30fps lock isn't going to make the experience great for most other users who enjoy fluid gaming under 60fps and plus, 30 fps lock in 2015 seriously? not a big fan of that.\n-Performance issues? Well I do have a high end gaming pc so I didn't experience anything like frame drops, buggy movements or anything like that. Not everyone has a rig that runs everything maxed out, though.\n-Slightly expensive, as I said, this isn't a great pc port so far, I was expecting this to be $49.99 maximum?\n\nI have not tried playing online so I'd hold my opinion on that.

I'm primarily a PC gamer and always wanted a PC port of MH, but that never happened. When I found this game, I was very excited. I have enjoyed the game so far, but it does have some technical problems and the game is very shallow when compared to MH.\n\nThe technical problems I have had with it are extremely low frame rates anywhere outside of the mission areas. I have experienced some minor freezing (a couple of seconds now and then) inside missions, but for the most part, the missions have been playable without much of a problem. I see a lot of people complaining about the poor keyboard/mouse support, but I use a controller so I have nothing to add to those complaints. It works just fine with a controller.\n\nAll voice acting is in Japanese, but the text is all English (assuming you want English) and while it might be nice to hear the voice acting in English, it doesn't cause any issues with playability for English speaking gamers. If you can tolerate the low frame rates in town (and even that isn't a constant problem, but happens often) and plan on using a controller, then I think you'll find little else in the way of technical problems to prevent you from enjoying the game. If you've played MH a lot and enjoyed it, you may find this is a pale comparison, but otherwise, it's not a bad game, just not a great one. The price does seem very steep ($60 USD) and I expect it may come down before long.\n\nI'd give this game a 3 out of 5 in its current state. I know the developers are still working on improvements and patches seem to be happening on a regular basis so that's a good thing.","October 29, 2015","true","30.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I mean the cheapest you can get the game is £47 from what i have seen and that's from Gee two ayy. You could probably get it cheaper for second hand on console but for the PC version i wouldn't bother with it untill it drops at least £20 in price then i would say it's worth it.\n\nEven though i don't recommend it for that reason the game is still a great bit of fun with hundreds of hours of gameplay. So much content that with 16 hours at the time of typing up this review that i haven't even scraped the surface. I'm not even half way through the chapters yet nor do i have 1/10th of the collectables. A lot of people have been giving this negative reviews because it's a "poor port" but Dark Souls was a terrible port untill people began to mod it and that never recieved anything negative? But i digress. It's very much worth checking out if you're into Japanese Hunting games but because of the price i recommend you do not purchase it. If you really want to try it then i suggest you pirate it or wait for a large price drop/sale.\n\nIf i am to nit-pick i would say that the story swaps between cut scenes and text based far too much. The cut scenes are lovely visually but then it just swaps to text where the character models have no animations and it's just the same as reading a book. The story starts off very slowly but eventually picks up once around chapter 6 and you often get choices as to what your character can respond to but the choices have the exact same outcome. Why give me a choice if both paths lead to the same road? Regardless the story isn't the main focus here and the boss battles are but it has the typical problem of this genre like Monster Hunter, Dragon's Dogma and Mercenary Kings suffers from: the monsters just get colour swaps and they some times just change the models on them but keep the same moves so you're still pretty much fighting the same monsters but aside from that the game play is very unique and fun though unfortunatly it is a little on the easy side also. I rarely found myself upgrading my gear as it wasn't needed. If you really want a challenge i suggest playing the game without armour as it's the only way the game actually becomes difficult. Also the lack of a block function can be some times annoying yet at the same time it also makes you really think about when you should attack. Though it doesn't matter because the game is so easy you can just tank and smash with hardly any health loss especially if you select Nagi as she makes you invincible.","July 3, 2015","false","37.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Doesn't try to be anything it's not, but does what it can to differentiate itself. A very competent attempt to copy the Monster Hunter formula. Not nearly enough to justify paying $60 when the real Monster Hunter is much better, has much more content, and only costs $40 with free DLC--unless you don't own a 3DS.\n\nEven then, I'd wait for this to go on sale if you want to fill that Monster Hunter-shaped void but don't want to buy a 3DS.\n\nThat being said, there's no mouse support, x360ce requires a lot of extra tweaking just to work with this game if you don't have a native xinput controller, it's locked at 30 FPS, and has a tendency to crash unless you set the EXE to Windows 7 compatibility mode and set "particle effects" to low.","January 6","true","29.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

I figured since most of them were about the controls, it wouldn't be too big of a deal. Boy was I wrong. Firstly, the game offers no options for controller configeration, so you can ONLY use a xbox controller. Secondly, the fps, even at the most mimimum settings, not full screen, and a lower resolution is GOD AWFUL. We're talking 10 fps or so here. Thirdly, the combat is really not fun. Its very button smashy, and the combos don't feel fluid at all. Every combo seemed to put me in the air, but the enemies were not knocked up as much, so it just left me pretty much floating in mid air hitting nothing. This is the first game I've requested a refund for, because it was just plain terrible.","December 26, 2015","false","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This isn't a Monster Hunter clone. Monster Hunter was a lot better than this.\n\nNo, this game is a Phantasy Star clone with the Monster Hunter crafting system tossed in.\n\nNot really a bad thing, it actually works pretty well, BUT...\n\n\n-Being locked at 30fps and dropping in town or certain areas, WITH the physics engine tied to the framerate is a dealbreaker in this game.\n\n-The fights all play out the same, you take a weapon in, you slaughter a hoard or boss, you go home and craft.\n\n-Storage upgrades are locked behind story mode progress, not a good thing.\n\n-Little explanation of the Mitama combo system, and the armor one is just having the whole set. So no mix-n-match like with Monster Hunter.\n\n+It is still fun to use certain weapons, I prefer the ones where you go arial, namely the Sickle and the Twin Daggers classes. But the surefire way to win is to get a Rifle with Abyss shot, do a charge attack and just lock the enemy boss in place while your team smashes its face in.\n\n+The story actually tries to make sense and gives you a reason for what you're doing.\n\n+The weapon variety helps, since everyone had their own playstyle.\n\n\nI didn't play online yet because I was told it was just a bad idea unless you have friends that play, and I don't.","May 28","false","28.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Nicely paced and very enjoyable combat. To be honest haven't played in Monster hunter like... at all, so was comparing Toukiden Kiwami with Dark Souls or rather Soul Sacrifice. Combat is Toukiden is nice. Very enjoyable. You do not require to have some ultra mega stats for using one specific weapon. You can get through tier X with sword, switch to daggers in Tier Y and finish Tier Z with a bow or something. This I like. Plus you can switch those spirits to get different set of magic to your assist.\n\nFighting with bosses are absolutely amazing! I remember how my character and bunch of fellow slayers were fighting with what seems to be a cockatrice and got sooooo tired of being set on fire all the time, so finale where my character jumped into the air anime style, get his magical spear finisher ready and threw it into monster's head killing it for good! Mind blowingly satisfying!!! And looks badass! And there are plenty of situations where you'll be able to show your badassay!\n\n2. Story. So far it's nice. Characters have personalities and their own problems you can/have to help them to resolve. Like someone got best friend killed in some circumstances and you should help them to deal with guilt and move on. Overall story seems to be interesting. There is an explanation as of why situation is like it is. Cutscenes are great, voice acting is nice.\n\nThere is a stereotypical tsundere-ish one, but when her backstory revealed, you feel bad for her and understand that behaviour. So bottom line - characters written nicely. Not like ultimate-literature-award, but just nicely and enjoyable.\n\n3. Loot. Oh you precious things and stuff :D Lots of things ca be taken from battlefield! Some are hidden and you need to use special "sneak peek" mode to get them and make regen stones visible. Also plenty of stuff to craft.\n\n4. Graphics are nice. Backgrounds look good, models look good, stuff looks good :D Not majestic, but nice.\n\nBad points:\n1. Some farming. To be honest that's the only bad thing I see in the game. You proooobably will need to get through same missions multiple times to get better loot from bosses. And if you finish enough side quests for some side characters - you'll get some new upgrades. In the game it soooooooorta goes as those NPCs become your better friends. So... unless you're a friend of a village - they will not move a finger to help you even though you're basically their main Dante who slays demons left and right. Little bit weird and somewhat annoying.\n\nAnd some technical stuff.\n\nMy rig:\nWin 7 x64\nRAM 8\nCPU i7 930 @2.80 GHz 2.79 GHz\nGeForce GTX 660\n\nAmount of crashes - 0\nAmount of issues - 0\nAmount of inability to finish a mission - 0\nDo I give a care if game is running 100000k FPS on a monitor which I bought for billion dollars and has resolution of 2mil p - no. If game runs smooth and I don't see super slow mo all the time - I'm fine with whatever framerate there is.\nDo I like anime-like games, JRPG - absolutely!\nAm I a fan of Koei Tecmo - nope. If anything, I'm more of a fan of people who released Agarest and Neptunia.","July 11, 2015","true","59.0"," 19 of 40 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","19","40","0","0"

However, claims that the game is unplayable and "bad" are just... Really big exaggerations. If you demand 60 FPS? Yeah, you might be disappointed. However, my experience while playing was buttery smooth with no hitches or lag in graphics. So, if the game IS only running at 30 FPS? Big whoop. I don't notice the difference between this or any other game I've played. Runs fine.\n\nAs a second note, I also see a lot of complaints about there being no mouse support. While this is a fair issue, you're WAY better off playing this game with a controller anyways. These types of games were designed for it.\n\nAs for me, my only real issues came with initially starting the game. Whoever coded the game for the US/EU release made the odd choice to have the graphics menu when first booting the game start in japanese rather than English (or another language). It's an easily remedied problem, as the option for English is IN English, but, it scared me at first before I looked at it.\n\nMInor sound problems in the form of volume for the movies not being linked to ANY of the sound options means you'll need to lower the volume of the overall game in the mixer, then adjust your music, SFX and voice volumes to match it so your ear drums aren't blown when a cinematic plays.\n\nNow, for the good stuff. Like Monster Hunter? Like Dynasty Warriors? This game has the best of both worlds. Intense fights with big monsters and the sort of grace and over-the-top athletics of Dynasty Warriors will have you dancing around the monsters (or Oni) with all the awesomeness of your favorite action anime. Controls are smooth (once you learn them. Definitely hit up Yamato once you've gotten to chapter 1 and learn the basic controls, as there is no way to view what button does what in your controller scheme except through that) and I had little trouble in learning small nuances that make the combo system so much fun.\n\nAll in all, it's not a bad port as many claim. Game runs fine, it's fun. Maybe a little expensive, but, if you're a Monster Hunter fan, you know the amount of hours you can sink into a game like this.","July 2, 2015","true","133.6"," 16 of 34 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","16","34","0","0"

Locked at 30fps, if you care about that sort of thing, and very hit and miss at the moment. Some will be able to run this no problem, and some may have problems running it with certain Nvidia cards, and some may not even be able to run it at all.\n\nThe game itself plays like a Monster Hunter type, with several weapon types with their own movesets and gimmicks, and passive skills attained not from armor, but from souls one can equip and level to unlock more passive skills. Each soul are categorized into different types, such as Attack, Speed, Defense and the likes, with each of those types having three active skills unique to the type.\n\nThe combat are fast paced, though early on in the chapters the enemies are sluggish, weak and tend to stand around doing their idle animation. Then in the later chapters, it slaps you in the gonads, kick your dog, and burns your pancakes, as monsters get faster and gain new attacks.\n\nThe AI companions you can choose to bring along to both offlne and online are thankfully intelligent, as far as I could see from my own games, so they rarely need to be babysitted, and very often able to take care of themselves.\n\nThe Graphics are good, though locked at 30 fps, if youre the type to care about those. For me, 30 fps still looks smooth on my computer, so I didn't mind.\n\nAll in all, it plays like Monster hunter, with much less emphasis of the preparation and gathering, and more into the combat and action. Gathering is still important though.","July 2, 2015","true","141.5"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

I am writing my first ever steam review to say it is fact a great, very fun game.  Also TLDR version at very bottom.\n\nNegatives (Not really)\n\nI only truly see two “issues” with this game really. The lack of mouse/keyboard, and the 30 FPS lock. The 30 FPS lock is not an issue to me as this game runs VERY smooth for me. I have had no stutters, glitches, or crashes in my 15 hours of play. Granted I have a EVGA Windforce GTX 770 4gb card, but I am playing with every setting maxed, and I feel lesser hardware should run this fine. The mouse/keyboard may been a huge problem for some people. This game is designed for a controller, and ported with one in mind, plain and simple. There are no keyboard buttons on screen, and even using a keyboard and mouse everything on screen still refers to X,Y,A,B keys. Koei has a problem with doing this on their latest ports as Dynasty Warriors 8: Empire did the same, but in reverse as it only showed keyboard commands in game. As I only use controllers for these types of game, that game did bother the HELL out of me, so I can see the keyboard/mouse community's issues here.\n\nPositives\n\nThis is a Monster Hunter style game on pc, plain and simple if you are into that sort of thing. There a quite a few different maps to run around, varied monsters, and crafting to make bigger better weapons to slay with. The game is faster paced than Monster Hunter, but is still slower than Dynasty Warriors. Add to this a pseudo spell system and different weapon types and styles; you end up with a surprisingly deep game once you start trying out different weapons and skill builds.\n\nThe story is pretty good. Nothing super deep or profound, but it does give you a reason to kill all those demons, and I genuinely find myself liking many of the characters as you get to interact with them and learn their back stories.\n\nOnline – There is up to 4 player co-op through the games missions, and I can say it is hella fun (if you can find other people to play with). Some folks say their game had horrible online syncing, well as far as I can tell there is no server based gameplay. If the host has crap internet then you will experience lag. I hosted my own online matches, and had no issues with the other players syncing. If you want to minimize the potential for lag go into the settings and tell it to only connect to other English players. I have never seen a Japan hosted game ever run smoothly.\n\nTLDR\n\nIf you want a fun Monster Hunter style game on pc, this game is great; as long as you don’t mind using a controller. It wont ever receive the glorious pc master race seal of approval for its port job, but as long as you aren’t “trying to run it on a potato” (a quote from my best friend) you should have a great experience with many hours of play ahead of you.","July 3, 2015","true","45.5"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","9"

I also own this game on PS4 and there it works very well, i've almost completed the story and I have dozens of hours sank into it. I was worried what with this being a port and the track record the company has concerning ports, but I took a gamble and bought it anyway. Luckily I have two weeks to get a refund, so i'm waiting for any information to be released shortly before that deadline concerning any patches they have in mind to solve this port's many issues before I submit my request for a refund.  On console the game's great.\n\nThe two most glaring problems at the moment in my personal experience make the game unplayable.\n\nThe first is that when I run this game in fullscreen, it will either freeze at a black screen permanently or crash. Fun!\n\nSecond, if I used windowed to work around this problem then the game performs terribly. The framerate is nowhere near static; I doubt it's ''locked'' to 30, 30 is probably just the best it can do, if you have the seemingly random requirements and specs it takes to have this actually work at all.  The tutorial fight and first visit to town that followed was like I was playing the game in slow motion. It was slow and choppy.\n\nAs for a final statement, avoid this game. It's ridiculous that this company can just keep tossing out poor quality ports and not keep anyone updated on if they plan to rectify their mistakes. I may change this review at a later date if they put the work in to fix this, but if not, then it's just another tally on the list of bad ports from the company. It's honestly a fantastic game if it would actually work.\n\nEDIT: By running the game as administrator in compatibility mode with windows 7, I was able to rid myself of most of the problems presented. Now that I can give an actual review of the game (sans the online component, haven't tried that out yet) I can explain some things.\n\nStory: The story of this game is stronger than the counterpart series, or at least from what i've played of it, meaning Monster Hunter. You play the part of a created Slayer, a militarized demon slaying individual that has the ability to speak with and work with the souls of legendary heroes who grant you abilities, called Mitama. There are NPC characters with their own personal storylines to follow, though most of their personalities are somewhat trope-ish. It has more in the story department than most Monster Hunter games, but it's nothing groundbreaking; be a big hero, you're a unique snowflake, yadda yadda and so on.\n\nGameplay: I like to think of the gameplay as a cross between Monster Hunter and Dynasty Warriors. Combat as a whole is more fast paced and aggressive. Weapons swing faster than in Monster Hunter, combos are in general longer and easier to perform, and the Demons in this game are more aggressive and more durable than most I remember fighting in MH3U or MH4U. You kill demons for materials, use said materials to craft gear, and kill bigger demons. It's a hunting game. There is also a teamwork component. One side of this mechanic is that if you go down, you don't immediately ''cart''. You go into a bleedout and allies can help you up, but if the demon is angry enough sometimes this isn't very possible to perform. On the other side, there's Team Destroyer moves. Each weapon type's Team Destroyer is different in animation, but generally just deals huge damage.\n\nBefore I go any further with that, the combat in Toukiden revolves around you dismembering large demons, cutting limbs off of their physical bodies to reveal a ''spirit body'' underneath it. You can purify physical limbs, which works a lot like carving, and prevents the demon from regenerating that limb. Hitting the spirit body is what does actual damage to the demon. Back to Team Destroyers. Basically, as you fight, you have a normal Destroyer gauge, which is a one man super move that instantly hacks off a limb and does high damage, and the Team Destroyer gauge fuels a move that when the gauge is filled allows you to approach allies and connect to them with lines of electricity. The more connections you have, the more limbs you sever with a team Destroyer if your aim is good enough.\n\nSpeaking of weapons, there's something for everyone.There's the melee category, with the Sword, Spear, Knives, Chain Sickle, Naginata, Fists, and Hammer, and the ranged category with Bows and Guns. Each one obviously has its own moveset and and specialties, so there's pretty much something for everybody.\n\nGraphics:\n\nSound: The music I feel is fairly well done and fits with the mood of what you're doing at the moment. The town theme is peaceful and calm, while when in the field the music will switch between standard battle music and more intense music when fighting a large demon. The sound effects for the most part are done well, with each hit you deliver, take, or evade having an appropriate level of volume. You hear your feet hit the ground when you sprint, you hear impact noises when landing hits with your weapon, and standard stuff along those lines. The music of the game fits the mood and setting well.\n\nControls: Unfortunately this is one of the areas the game falls short. If you don't have a controller, I would suggest holding off on buying this title until you do. The keyboard controls are godawful and from what I understand can't be remapped. I use an Xbox 360 controller, though, and I didn't struggle with any controls. Everything was pretty much exactly where I had expected it to be upon plug in. Being a hunting game, the controls are very responsive and there's almost never a moment where you'll take a hit you feel like shouldn't have connected.\n\nReplay: Being a hunting game, replay value is up in the air. You have three characters slots, but if you really wanted to, you could build every weapon and armor set in the game along with all Mitama on one character. It'd be a grind, but it's totally doable. With that, replay would be a pretty optional thing here. Being it's the only game of its type currently on steam that I know of, i'll likely do several runs through it myself.\n\nFinal: If you'd like a hunting game on PC, check this out if you have a controller. I can't guarantee the solution I found will work for everyone, but assuming it does, this is a good game in its own right that sets itself apart from being a clone of Monster Hunter. It has its own pacing and flow, not to mention its own features and quirks that make it fun all on its own.","June 27, 2015","true","28.9"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","1"

Well composed instrumentals that would fit into any other JRPG like the Final Fantasy series. I really can't decide if I like MH or T:K's soundtrack more. They're both really lovely.\n\nI have not run into any glaring issues. 30 FPS isn't an issue as the game looks fluid, but I am using a GSYNC monitor, so that may be why I'm okay with it that low. I still don't think it's an issue, though. Also, there is no noticable input lag.\n\nEDIT: To force 30 FPS and fix the speed-up caused by an unlocked framerate, I used Nvidia Inspector to create a profile for the game and limit the framerate to cap at 30 FPS.\n\nYou will need a controller to play. I can't imagine trying to juggle this game around on a keyboard. Buy a wired Xbox 360 controller or Xbox One controller - its great for other games you might want to play, such as racing games when you have no wheel, or any other 3rd person game like GTAV.\n\nIf you are budget consious, I can't recommend this game at $60, but if you are looking for a good cross between MH and Vindictus, have a decent PC and have the money to blow, go for it. I'm happy with my purchase and imagine I will be playing for some time to come.","July 3, 2015","true","19.2"," 24 of 51 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","24","51","0","2"

AI teammates help out a lot in combat with breaking parts, purifying them, and healing you if you fall. However, combat is quite easy and once you know a good combo, that's what you will use in every battle essentially. However, skills are a changable way to add flavor to the slashing and hacking.\n\nGathering: there is not a lot of grinding required to get certain materials and once you attain a certain helper, it becomes extremely easy to get non monster materials, and there do not seem to be extreely rare monster materials so it only ends up taking a 1 or 2 kills to get what you want.\n\nUpgrading: Upgrading equipment happens after a boss kill and you will really only have to re-kill that boss abut 5 times to get a full set of equipment, and then there is fortifying which you can do after using certain equipment for a certain amount of time, for no material or monetary cost.\n\nWhat doesn't work\n\nMissions: While I personally prefer it, the missions are sort of arena style. There are different maps but only a few areas of said map available in each mission and monsters can't move areas. I understand this might be boring for many people, but I think it keeps the game action focused.\n\nStory: The story is fairly run-of-the-mill save the world from impending doom. I am only in chapter 3 of 13 or something like that, and it is hinting at something more intricate, but I'm not sure if it will end up that way.\n\nFinally, some comparisons (sorry). It is essentially an action alll the time monster hunter (no mining, gathering herbs, combining, no changing health bar or stamina bar size, no hunger) with the setting of something close to the manga/anime Bleach (sould devouring oni, souls in weapons, purifying souls) and I think this marriage goes exteremely well and that the way the game progresses lack a lot of the false difficulty that plagues the Monster hunter series (enemies run away, parts are super rare, slow animations, mining and pickaxe breaks randomly etc.). I strongly recommend this if you think you're system is compatible. I personally have windows7 and a nvidia 750ti and everything is butter smooth, and I can't seem to mind the 30fps lock.\n","July 4, 2015","true","64.7"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","0"

I really did. I strode in, knowing that it was unpolished and unrefined. I knew about the 30fps-lock, the eccentric HUD, the occasional shuddering, even the odd hang. There's a saying about being pessimistic: "If you're right, you're satisfied, and if you're wrong, you're pleasantly surprised."\nI am satisfied that this game is as rough as everyone makes it out to be.\nFirst off, the game launcher is an absolute mess. It loads up in Japanese and you have to click the only latin text there to make it English. While doing that, hitherto unseen tabs started appearing beneath my cursor OVER the elements I was trying to read. Tabs like Graphics Settings sitting right on top of buttons like Fullscreen On/Off. Also, you're out of luck if you have a monitor at 1380*1060 or *1068. The options are 1280*1020 and 1990*1600. Downscaling YAY.\nOkay, whatever, I didn't buy this £50 wad of eastern gibberish to stare at an ugly little box. Let's run the game. Alright, I got to put my name in. There's an on-screen keyboard and a blinking caret. I type... What? I HAVE to use the on-screen keyboard? We haven't done that since Halo CE!\nOk, this isn't going to be any different than the PS4, so let's get this out of the way. Oh, darling cutscene. Runs pretty smooth, volume is way too high (even though in options, it's set to 50%, and Windows Volume Mixer cut it down to 40% after that). Minimise the game, change volume, open game. Huh? The game won't restore again! Get this damn thing open, I'm missing action!! Ok, screen turns black, and "TOUKIDEN has encountered a problem, please wait while we look for a solution." A multitasker, this ain't, but I can believe that Windows 10 also has blame in this.\nReload, my save file is still there, get over the opening blurb, and I'm in a tutorial battle! Suddenly, 30FPS! Ok, I grew up on a shoestring-budget hand-me-down PC, I can tolerate this. Beat the tutorial boss, more cutscene. The BGM is still loud as hell, so minimise and quieten. Oop, game crashed again.\nRestart game, save file still there, elapsed time is all zero. Need to do the tutorial battle again. Ok that battle was KIND OF neat, I can tolerate that. I beat the Oni faster than before. Text dialogue afterwards, but the BGM starts scrubbing, like a DJ is scratching it incessantly. Hammer the button to get through the dialogue, and the music behaves, but now the game is at 20FPS. In a single-player area. In an area that does not warrant such awful slowdown. The game is a port, but even Sonic Adventure got some port optimisation before they shipped it off the Dreamcast.\n\nI got a refund. I'd like to find I gave this game a fair shot. The asking price is awful (and I wouldn't have risked this venture if it weren't for Steam Refunds), the DLC asking prices are also a bit iffy.\nI hope this game gets improvements, but for the time being, save your money. Probably also keep an eye on this game at IsThereAnyDeal, because the full asking price is a total Christmas Cracker joke. There are redeeming factors about this game, but you're better off seeing them on this game's native platform.","August 21, 2015","false","0.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","29","2","7","2","0"

As a preface, most of the negative reviews under 30 minutes of gameplay are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I've played 15 hours in the game and haven't had a single crash or gameplay glitch, the 30 FPS lock is unnoticable and the game runs extremely smooth and looks beautiful, with that out of the way, here are my opinions.\n\nPros:\nFast, fluid combat.\nEasy to access multiplayer.\nSkills are easy to use and the Mitama system makes changing armor sets easy (especially compared to MH)\nThe Tenko companion is adorable and not annoying compared to the Palicoes in MH4U.\nGraphically impressive.\n\nCons:\nForced to use a controller (I'm okay with it personally since all Koei Tecmo games on Steam pretty much require a controller)\nFights are easy to hack and slash (This one is mainly due to the Mitama I use, I'm able to get soak a free hit, and at the current stage I'm at, getting hit really doesn't do too much damage, that will most likely change in the future, till then it's a con)\nMultiplayer lobby is one room only and lacking access to crafting, Tenko, and other village options. You're able to fortify your weapons/armor (which is a small stat boost to them) in the Lobby, but you can't see what you need to craft the next set, check what you Tenko brought you, or anything else village related without leaving the lobby entirely. This is okay if you have a dedicated friend to play with, but don't be surprised if you find it hard to keep playing with the same people as you keep leaving to check on your Tenko or see what that last boss's parts can be crafted into.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game to anyone with a Controller and who's a fan of Monster Hunter style games. It's far more action based than Monster Hunter, there is no weapon sharpness, gather quests, potion maintenance or anything of the sort. It's purely hunting, and that's enjoyable to me. The cons are mainly my personal opinion of the game mechanics, and nothing actually game breaking.","July 1, 2015","true","57.5"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","12","28","0","0"

I was personally unable to run it without it causing my Nvidia 780Ti driver's to crash after about 10 minutes or so of gameplay. However, I did study available footage of the PS4 version to see if struggling to fix the game was worthwhile, and if I hadn't I would not be wasting my time with this review with such little time played.\n\nOn every account the game seemed to be the Hack-and-Slash gameplay of a Dynasty/Samurai warriors game. Which I can and do enjoy on their respective series. However, I do have trouble imagining that this formula which works well for tearing through entire armies would work equally well for lengthy fights on single creatures. Sadly it looks like the majority of fights in this game are also considerably underwhelming and uninventive; amounting to little more than perhaps an uninteresting MMO boss with a big HP bar. In contrast Monster Hunter's monsters have significantly more interaction, varying states, are faster paced and have interaction with their environments (climbing, hunting, eating, sleeping, hanging from ceilings and more). While both games do boil down to "dodge the attack on the tell", Monster Hunter gives you a significantly larger pool of options to combat your adversary.\n\nThe contrast between these two game's weapon and item systems is evidently told through discussions and guides in each weapon found online. Both games fundamentally have a three button weapon style in addition to a dodge button. While both games have weapon combos, the combos and rate of attack are what set most melee weapons apart in Toukiden: Kiwami. In a Monster Hunter game, despite having a significantly larger pool of weapons each plays significantly differently. Despite the Greatsword, Longsword and Sword and Shield all having swords in their name, none of those weapons truly play in any similar fashion, and not all enemies can be approached the same way with the same weapon; with many monsters moving in different ways and their individual parts all taking different varying damage to different types and elements. In the case of Toukiden however the the largest significant difference of any weapon is that ranged weapons can hit high targets consistently.\n\nCustomisation in items and gear are significantly different. Toukiden: Kiwami’s armour only significantly varies on its defence and resistance values. Weapons differ only on damage values, elemental bonuses and slots. These “slots” are for the Mitama system, which is a much more pick up and play, simple variant of Monster Hunter’s decoration system. By using the Mitama which are basically the spirits of fallen Toukiden heroes of the past, you can level up and receive bonus skills that improve attack, HP etc. It is more simple than the Monster Hunter system, which that game was never good at explaining (after all it isn’t uncommon to see new people with mixed gear sets with less than +10 in skills online - rendering it useless). However one of the fan favourite aspects of any Monster Hunter entry is delving into the gear progression it offers. This isn’t even counting the fact MH has a significant pool of consumable items that make preparing for any individual fight a take in itself.\n\nOther issues I will run off quickly. The female walking animation was significantly bad, like some kind of demon warding washing machine dance of the wrists. The hub town was bland, unintuitive and the game’s pacing rushes you right back out of the town before you can become acquainted on your first visit. Lastly despite the fact the game advertised that it would auto-save, it never onced saved after the first tutorial fight, forcing me to face that Oni five times due to crashes.\n\nI wanted nothing less than this game to be good. I do believe there is room for a Monster Hunter clone on the PC, especially one capable of bringing some decent competition to Capcom's dominating franchise. Port issues aside, I do not believe I could have reccomended this game due to its lack of complexity and the uninspired adaptation of Dynasty Warriors gameplay to the MH genre. Keep playing Monster Hunter if you have the choice. In case you still want to go forward and purchase this game, make sure you have a controller and I hope for the best you don't run into significant port issues.","June 30, 2015","false","0.4"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

If you are not bothered by 30 fps, wait till people are saying it is actually staying there since that is the issue that is likely to get resolved first.\n\nI really like the idea of monster hunter, but no game is worth getting a whole console.  So when I saw this game on steam, I was overjoyed.  Yes, it was $60, but looking online the average amount of time people spend on this game is about 60 hours.  One hour per dollar is reasonable enough, but reading the comments I began to get worried.  Man oh man, I should have listened to them.\n\nNow, I know these games are designed to be played with a gamepad so the lack of good keyboard+mouse did not bother me.\nAlso, I go between console gaming and pc gaming a lot so I have yet to develop enough discretion to really be bothered by 30 fps.\nBUT that means the game actually needs to run at 30 fps.\n\nThis game does not.   It looks like this problem started after one of the patches, but the game has horrendous framerate issues.  Apparently "locked at 30 fps" means "you might get to 30 fps, if you are lucky."  And before anyone asks, yes I turned the all the settings down as low as they would go, and no I do not have a bad gaming pc.  I can play games with better graphics/effects/larger areas/etc just fine.\n\nI should make this clear: this is not a review of the game.  I would need to be able to actually play the game in order to do that.  I cannot do this due to how badly the game is lagging.\nNo, this is currently only a review of Koei Tecmo's ability to port games to pc.  They are bad at it.  Like, unbelievably bad at it.\n\nYou were supposed to be the ones who saved us from the tyranny of Nintendo's hold on monster hunter, Koei Tecmo.  You were going to bring a monster hunter game to PlayStation AND PC.  Instead, you brought one to PlayStation and a $60 pile of garbage to PC.  Just make the game work, Koei Tecmo.  You can try and do things about the 30 fps cap and the lack of key-binding later.  Right now, you need to focus on getting the game running AT A SOLID 30 fps.\n\nI, like everyone else, can wait two weeks for this.  I have two weeks for the game to get to the point where I can actually see if it is fun to play or not.  If this happens, I imagine you will get to keep my $60.  If not, well...\n\nI want to make it clear that I will take my money back solely to try to get Koei Tecmo to understand that we pc gamers will not stand for ports of this quality.  Even if you are a Koei Tecmo fanboy, I urge you, please don't encourage this behavior.  Don't buy this game as it is now.  Or, at the very least, refund it if the game is not up to a stable 30 fps by the time your refund period is about to expire.","July 4, 2015","false","1.1"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Also allows you to help friends as the progress adjusts to the lowest player\n- Did a 50 minute boss fight with another friend which was awesome, you actually had to figure out how to kill the boss and work together instead of just mindlessly smashing your face against him.

So you can be a healer ranged with a gun at one moment and then switch for the next mission and be an attack long sword.\n- Each weapon and Mitima has its own experience progress so lots to level up.  Each one also changes your play style and power ups\n- You get a cute ♥♥♥ pet that you can interact with and level up also!\n- Game is locked to 30 FPS but has 0 impact on the game for me, literally no slow downs or any issue what so ever (game runs smooth both in battle and in town)\n- The game was crashing for me alot on windows 8.1 as stated by the developers but i put my game into compatability mode for windows 7 and havnt had a single crash since.\n- Cinematics are pretty awesome and voice acting (japanese) is pretty good. typical japanese comedy and dialog.\n- Controls for keyboard and mouse are terrible sadly, only way to play the game is using a controller (im using my ps4 one and it works great)\n\nTry the game for yourself, there is always steams new refund policy if you arnt happy.","July 1, 2015","true","11.4"," 13 of 32 people (41%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","41","13","32","3","0"

You will HAVE to play with a controller as I couldn't imagine playing this game with just the keyboard.\n\nThat said, those are the only major negatives I can give this game - the rest are:\n\n- Slightly repetitive.\n- All japanese audio, English subtitles\n- Must be ran fullscreen else you chance framerate issues.\n\nNow that's out the way, let's tell you what the positives are:\n\n+ Awesome, visceral combat akin to the Dynasty Warriors series.\n+ Huge variety of weapons/armor and interesting modifiers to add to them.\n+ Cool, refreshing Oni (Demon) designs.\n+ In-depth body destruction, I have yet to come across an Oni that hasn't had 4+ breakeable limbs.\n+ Likeable characters, interesting enough story to drive the missions forward.\n+ No frame drops in the thick of the fight, no matter how many enemies are on screen.\n\nThis game is Monster Hunter without all the faff, there's little to no preparation to go into the fight and the nature of "grinding the monster down" (those of you familiar with the MH series will understand what I mean) is not present. Fights with major Oni are still a challenge but you feel like you're doing damage all the time due to the weight of the combat and the body destruction. For those of you who want MH to come to PC (spoiler: it's not) then this game is for you provided you can get past the price tag and the lack of care the developers have to optimies for PC.","June 30, 2015","true","14.5"," 23 of 54 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","23","54","0","14"

Then I lowered my resolution out of frustration. Game runs with very few issues now. I've liked the game for a while on PS4 and I fully approve of it's pc release, but the port is absolutely lack lustre in comparison. It's got little polish, and does not run well at all.\n\nI'm a big fan of monster hunter style games, and this is no exception. If you like MH games, or have an interest, this is a much more casual game for those who have never played one before.\n\nIt was very hard for me to get the game to a playable state, with massive frame drops in town, yet the important part, the hunts, had no issues even from the beginning. I'm absolutely clueless as to why that would be the problem, but I won't look a gift horse in the mouth. I 'm just happy I can play the game now.\n\nI recommend because it's fun, but the port is rough and if you want the game, be forewarned, it's likely you'll have a lot of issues unless your computer is up to snuff.","August 2, 2015","true","49.0"," 13 of 33 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","13","33","0","0"

Slaying oni and creating new armor is the name of the game. The story is decent and there is some level of interactions with the characters.\n\nI have had no problem running the game with my rig, but i found game does have a few problems especially when playing online, the game has lost sync with the other players and frame rate slows to a about 5fps when players went into another zone. The game is also locked at 30fps as it is ported directly from the ps4 version. Once my eyes adjusted to it, its not that bad. I would not recommend the game if you do not have a gamepad. I use an xbox 360 controller and it works great.\n\nOverall I have found this is a very enjoyable game and will probably be playing it for a while.","June 30, 2015","true","74.4"," 13 of 33 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","13","33","0","0"

It is exactly what I needed and wanted to play right now. Always wanted a Monster Hunter on PC and while this isn't exactly that, it is scratching my itch just fine.

You MUST run it in compatibility mode for Wins7 if you are using Wins8(this will put an end to crashing for most people).  You MUST run the game at 30fps.\n\nGraphics: Fair. These are not PC Level textures but they get the job done. The monsters also look really cool. The plus side of the Textures is you can now satify your curiosity when it comes to Super Sampling x8 and CSAA x32!(lol). They clean the game up quite nicely(visually the graphics will still be serviceable at best even after maxing AA and Filters via Nvidia Utility)\n\n\nFun Factor: Moderately high. You either like Monster Hunter or you don't. If you like MH you'll probably like this. PSO and Monster Hunter were my 1st "MMOs" lol. I didn't keep up with the series because I was playing things like WoW Vanguard, Rift ect. Anyway, the only reason thing that keeps the Fun Factor from being "Very High" is that I remember Monster Hunter being a lot more cerebral by comparison. You hunted for meat and made potions. You made drinks to keep you cool or warm you up, depending on the enviroment. I almost feel too strong early on especially with the NPCs.\n\nSound: Adequate. Still early on so nothing really stands out except the fact that there is no english voice acting. Meh. No biggie for me. I grew up on Anime.\n\nMy Theory: The game would have faced less backlash had it been appropriately priced. I am enjoying it thus far but in my personal opinion this isa not a 60 dollar game on PC or Consle for that matter. Both are more than capable of pumping out better Texture Quality, Framerates and Visuals than we are getting here.\n\nI reccomend it because it is still fun. PC lacks any good MH clones and the 30 FPS/Texture thing is not that big of a deal for me(Don't get me wrong though. I am a graphics hoor to a certain degree. I didn't spend $2300 bucks for nothin:P). I would say wait for a Price drop to buy but I risk losing you as a group member!\n\nP.S. I'm not a Koei Tecmo fanboy(for all you TB fans out there lol).

This game is not spoon fed to you. This game requires skill, timing, and hand eye coordination....\n\nSorry to break it to you guys but this game is heavily skill based... sure no mouse support... so what? keyboard controls are intuitive and relatively easy to use. They are in clusters that do not feel out of the way from one of the other keys you are using. That being said I'm using qwerty.\n\nPro's:\n-Smooth playing experience\n-Graphics feel like the old monster hunter games (I like them but I guess it is preference)\n-Unique enemies with different move sets that FEEL exciting when fighting a new archtype.\n-AI allies are GREAT sometimes too good actually, often find myself only selecting two or three versus the four.\n-Tons of item trees and enough elemental strengths / weaknesses for you to really put thought into what you'll face.\n-Town buff system(s) keep you going back for the extra boost that may make or break your next run!\n-A bunch of different weapon archtypes that allow for you to find a playstyle that fits you!\n\nCons:\n-A little unusual setup required with some hardware\n-Fiddling with settings often required for a good experience\n-Leaves you wishing the team that ported this simply added the keyboard keys for the animation and button listings in game as you have to think for the first hour or so what x,y,a,b or start for instance translates to on the keyboard.\n\nNow with that out of the way, after the initial setup my experience has been AMAZING with this game. I love this type of game so my opinion might be biased but I highly recommend this for anyone who loves monster hunter games. Yes this game is locked at 30 FPS, and? it runs and plays better than some AAA games have on launch. No there is no mouse support, would honestly make the game too easy. The complaints on the controls are unjustified, if you can't be bothered to learn the controls how do you think you'll do with the more advanced mechanics of the game? Controller support is there but for brand name controllers which I think is understandable but a bit lacking for a broader audience. All in all I don't see what most of the quips are about, I paid ~50$ for the game and would pay it again.\n\n*settings that worked for me*\nFor those having issues running the game check particle setting as I had to set that to low in order to prevent my game from crashing with GTX 780 and run in compatability mode Windows 8... odd but its the settings that worked for me.

The framerate was intolerable at 5 to 20fps on my GTX 770M which is unacceptable. After scouring forums I found the key to unlocking this gem of a game:\nIF YOU HAVE NVIDIA, YOU GOTTA CHANGE THE 3D SETTINGS!\nTo get this game to run at a high framerame on an NVIDIA card, you have to add it to the 3d Program Settings on the NVIDIA control panel and set the game to run using your GPU (High-performance nvidia processor). Then the game runs smooth as silk. As for the game itself, it's faithful to the PS4 port, a monster hunting squad based game with multiple missions, big bosses, upgradeable weapons and armor, abilities. and a....somewhat decent story. The game is fun: ya just gotta change the 3D settings to find this fun.","June 28, 2015","true","20.1"," 30 of 76 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","30","76","0","0"

Buyer beware if you want a refund back they wont give you your money back and tehy take teh game back. Steam and this company are a bunch of theives and i can prove it. lol. Steam took teh game back But have not give my money back for over 2 weeks now. WTF. I am pretty sure this is fraud and against the law in every country. So if want a refund your out of luck because they take the game back right away and keep your money. Steam better start explaining the selves asap or i am calling proper authorities. and teh media with proof of my claims the gaming will be all over this.\nI want my money back now. If i have wait anylonger then one more week for my money as promised by steam for my refund i will be letting the media know about this scam to warn other consumers. As well the BBB and the authorities. Refund scams are illegal and steam broke the law. You cant take the product back and for 2 weeks not give back money. That is a scam i have all the proof from my CC statements and my steam account. Proving you committed fraud with KT will be an open and shut case. lol. Plus the fine the feds will throw at you. lol.

However Toukiden manages!\nHundreds of Armor und Weapon Sets each coming with it's own Stat-Boni and absolute gorgeous and unique design with each and every single Set. You have every possible customization option avaiable, up until the higher ranks.\n\nWhat makes Toukiden different however is first and foremost it's Mitama System. Every few bosses/quests, you will loot a Mitama - some sort of Spirit Essence of Ancient Personalities (= that actually existed. It's really interesting to read up on those)\nThese Mitama can be inserted in your Weapons to give not only Stat Boni, but also alter your Skill Set. This highly influences the Dinamic of High-Ranked fights, when in a party of up to 4 players. It's way more engaging than Monster Hunter and communicating with your fellow Slayers is not only a necessity, but through a 5-Pages Message Menu not only easy but it can wholly substitute a voice chat, making Matchmaking with Strangers more pleasant than other Games of a similar genre.\n\nAnother huge difference is the much more developed story of Toukiden in contrast to Monster Hunter, a Story which albeit lacks depth, can be engaging in certain key moments and had me on the edge of my chair in certain situations, like the finale of Ch. 2. It manages your tension and keeps you interested, even if you may or may not be a fan of the hunting genre.\n\nLastly the Boss-Fights. They are exactly what you'd expect. It's Monster Hunter, but with giant, greatly designed Demons, based on Japanese Mythology. It has it's own charme, but I do find some of the Bosses lacking in personality in contrast to the Monster Hunter Franchise.\n\n\nTo conclude:\nToukiden is a gorgeous mix between Dynasty Warriors and Monster Hunter, which exceeds the Customization Options of the latter with the Mitama System. It tries to get you interested in the History surrounding this very over-the-top hunting game through the Mitama-History Section as well as reading up on what the Oni for example are actually based on.\nThe combat is fluent and keeps you hooked for hours on end, as well as being less grindy than Monster Hunter. Especially if you're shooting for a 100% Completion. Multiplayer got much more love and interaction between players is highly supported, which makes the random-matchmaking an absolute bliss.\nAdditionally (even if I lack some experience in that field) - the Game seems to have a very good Netcode, so that I was able despite my very bad Internet-Connection to even Host entire Lobbys without Lag or similar issues.\n\nAll in all, if you can be interested in the Style of Toukiden and you're looking for a more fast-paced Monster Hunter: This game is definitly woth every cent!\n","June 29, 2015","true","396.2"," 23 of 62 people (37%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","37","23","62","5","3"

Valkyria Chronicles came out as a fantastic port at a very reasonable price tag. This is way overpriced. Don't buy it outside of sales unless you have disposable cash on hand.\n\nFramerate:\nI have yet to encounter any framerate dropping issues in-game, at max settings. But the main issue at hand is that the framerate is locked at 30fps. This is unacceptable for a PC game in 2015, port or not. Although playable, movements and animations can feel jerky and unresponsive. Forcing it to run at 60fps using G-sync or V-sync makes a hilarious "Everybody's on their 10th cup of coffee" playthrough.\n\nController:\nThis game did a terrible port job for the keyboard controls (DOES IT EVEN WORK?). It requires a controller to play comfortably. Good luck playing it with a mouse and keyboard, because I don't even know how to proceed beyond the start menu without the controller. Like Monster Hunter and God Eater, this game is built with controllers in mind.\n\nGraphics:\nI'm not sure if the port is using the Vita or PS4 version, but it does feel dated. Even at highest setting, the graphics are underwhelming.\n\nWhy Good?\n\nBreasts:\nYes, the females in this game has them. And they are very nice. You get to see a nice selection of them during the bathing scenes too. Unfortunately, I played as a male character, so I didn't get to see much before getting kicked out of the bathing pool.\n\nStoryline:\nGeneric "Hero comes from somewhere and feels the need to defend this village" storyline. The interesting parts aren't the villages, but each individual character's background story.\n\nArmour/Weapon Design:\nNot as in-depth as Monster Hunter's style of armour skills and Math involved. Instead, you get skills from your Mitamas (hero spirits) that are equipped on your weapon. This makes it a lot easier for players to change into different types of weapons without having to stress over incompatible armour skills on the new bling armour you just painfully crafted. Just swap your Mitamas while wearing your favourite stylish armour set. The weapon and armour designs are flashy and impressive looking.\n\nPet:\nTenko > Poogie.\nCyu-ee~","June 29, 2015","true","31.3"," 26 of 69 people (38%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","38","26","69","6","0"

Beim baden muss auch beachtet werden dass der Charakter nicht immer rein kann. Mal ist die Quelle nur für männliche mal nur für weibliche Charaktere geöffnet. Das kann man durch Freundschaften später\naber auch umgehen.\n\n**Meist hat es gestört wenn man von seinen eigenen Mitspielern umgeworfen, überrannt ect. wurde. Allerdings führte es auch zu mehr Absprache und Taktik. Allerdings macht es auch Spaß sich mal keine Gedanken darüber zu machen.\n\nNegativ:\n- Zu teuer\n- Altbackene Grafik, dennoch recht detailreich\n- Erfüllt nicht die Standards heutiger Konsolen Portierungen\n- "Nur" Englische Texte (für einige sicher ein Problem)\n- Mäßige Charaktererstellung\n- Nur sammeln und töten Aufgaben\n- Relativ enge, kleine Kartenabschnitte\n- Wiederholend, ist man als MH Spieler ja wie gewöhnt\n- Online Modus beinhaltet keinen Chat*\n\n*Zwecks Kommunikation muss auf englische, vorgefertigte Texte in verschiedenen Kategorieren zurückgegriffen werden oder man nutzt Emotes.

Here's what's up.\n\nIt looks like a Monster Hunter clone on the outside, and a lot of things are extremely similar. That's fine to me. If Capcom wants to drag its heels while we're all relying on a chinese branch with terrible launch reviews to give us what we want for PC online play, that's fine. You know what? ♥♥♥♥ Capcom. This game is delivering what I want. It has a little of everything I like from all my JRPGs. I'm even going to throw this out there: the combat FEELS better than Monster Hunter. You can still get caught with your pants down in combos, but everything is more fluid. In single player (because I seem to be the only person who bought this game), the characters are voice acted and add to the experience a great deal. There are Senpais, Tough Guys, Smart Guys, and Tsunderes.\n\nI'm hoping I can update this when I fight some larger monsters or even find a multiplayer lobby. It's hard to drop $60 on a game that looks like a clone-flop. I get it. If someone else buys it, add me to friends and we'll do some partying.","June 25, 2015","true","113.2"," 392 of 917 people (43%) found this review helpful 68 people found this review funny","43","392","917","68","36"

I didn't get any crashes or weird stuff so far.\nIt's a ps4 port, not a Vita one (some people were saying that this is a Vita port, that's why I'm clarifying that)\n\nVERY IMPORTANT: If you don't want to use a gamepad, forget about this game. There is no mouse support, and keyboard only controls can be really frustrating.\n\nThe voices are in Japanese, story is as one would expect from a monster hunting game.

A Monster Hunteresque game finally on pc, not one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ free to play ones either. This game is no Dark Souls or any other fantasy action rpg. This is monster hunter in every way possible, but it doesn't quite match the depth of Monster Hunter games. Such as no crafting of items and no items in general to bring on missions. That's mostly because it doesn't have years and years of experience behind it but it is a step in the right direction for a game trying to make it's name in a genre dominated by a singular IP.\n\nI would say it is an excellent game, and hope that they make sequels and continue bringing them pc. I have had no issues with this game. 30 fps? Oh well, who cares? I've been playing games since Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis and I'm ok with that. No super cool graphics customization? Koei isn't really known for their pc games, considering that this is one of their few modern games to actually make it onto pc.

Not sure if all 3 need to be set that way, but I did just to be safe.\n\n-"Run this program as admin" is checked on in the compatability tab under the properties setting for all 3 applications listed above as well.\n\n-Used RivaTunerStatisticsServer (RTSS) to limit the framerate for this game to 30.

Despite that i decided to go ahead and buy it. While the game was downloading, simmering with rage, i was already preparing a negative review for it. Was actually discussing with a friend how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is that japanese devs cant seem to grasp the handle on a simple fact : 60 FPS for PC players.\n\nOnce the game finished downloading, and i started playing, my rage slowly went away,replaced by curioisty, and then mild enjoyment ( so far). Skipping the gameplay mechanics ( since its a Monster Hunter-like game,that seems to be slightly more fast paced and streamlined) i will tackle the issue that many people already seem to be up in arms about ( and for good reason) : performance.\n\nDespite the 30 FPS cap, i must say, that the game runs smoothly ( inb4 silky smooth 29 fps jokes). As an avid PC gamer, i too want constant 60 fps, but this ended up actually molyfing me. The fluidity of the gameplay made me forget very fast about the FPS cap and i went ahead and started enjoying the game. It seems well optimised, despite this fact. And just to show that Batman is horibly optimised, here is a game that,despite the cap manages to somehow run well even with the dreaded lock in place. Who knows,maybe in the future we will see ports that will bring everything we want?\n\nThe only negative thing i see in this game's launch is it's price tag : i think a 30-40 Euro price tag would have suited it much better for what it offers. 60 euro might be a bit to steep for some people. However, if you can afford it,and like JRPGS, and you feel like PC's need more games like this, buy it.\n\nTL;DR : Buy the game and try it, if you can afford it, before burning it on the stake ( like i was about to do). You can always isntantly refund it if it fails to deliver. I for one think it's worth a shot.","June 26, 2015","true","27.0"," 27 of 90 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","27","90","0","0"

Which it doesnt, its completely fluently capped at the framerate, so me as a guy who has a 144hz monitor would actually say that my modded skyrim @45~ fps runs actually worse than Toukiden: Kiwami.\n\nThe price seems absolutely justified to me, even if i had to pay in pounds or whatever the heck currency you want me to pay in. Far as im concerned i will play this game for hundreds of hours and will get my moneys worth no matter what.\n\nIn terms of direct comparison to MH, this game has more exciting bosses once you are around 5 hours into the game. The first boss you get that you could qualify as a fire breathing wyvern (to compare to i.e. rathian or qurupeco) turns into a lanky kong-esque mantis with fireflower powerup that slings around its arms and makes fire rain all around it while dancing when down to 1/3 of its health. And pretty much all the bosses afterwards do these ridiculous transformations once their HP gets below a certain threshold, which really makes the fights epic in comparison to MH uhhh, making the mobs simply faster and perhaps give them one or two special attack patterns while raging they wouldnt use when calmed down.\n\nThe game also scraps the tedium of carrying a varied assortment of pickaxes, bug nets and what the hell just to crunch the RNG because you need whatevertheheck ore to craft that one cool equipment set. Instead you pick up shiny sparkly lights that are easy to find in each area, and thats as far as collecting materials goes.\n\nThe weapons are also very fun to play and you also are free to use any weapons right from the get go without limiting your progress speed (i am looking at you, bowgun). No need to pay for ammo or all that crap that makes being a ranged character a complete pain in the monster hunter universe. This game streamlines everything that needs to be streamlined, and thats great.\n\nAlso the soundtrack is great.","June 26, 2015","true","58.0"," 18 of 68 people (26%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","26","18","68","2","0"

Only a few crashes here and then but it's a new port so I can't blame it. Overall very nice experience\n\nI currently own Monter Hunter 4 which I played quite alot and I really liked it, besides the combat being all slow and inaccurate, a PC version of monster hunter was just what I needed, I can use a controller this time and play on a larger screen, the game looks pretty good to go along with the art style the game follows. The game's setting is very heavily focused on ancient Japanese culture and tradition so don't expect to see a bullet train, although there is a rifle. The combat is smooth and has only a few flaws that I think can really mess up plays such as...\n\nThe Ability to sheathe, yes the ability to sheathe is actually pretty essential for these types of games to interact and do other things. You can sheate by running and it will auto sheathe but then that just requires you to move away from what you want to interact w/ and you'll have to run back, not too bad but a very essential element to me.\n\nThe ability to block/shield, maybe it's just me and I'm super dumb, but I haven't found a way to block, this mechanic is very essential to absorb damage and to keep your attacks constant against a mob. A must have for any game of this genre.\n\nThe weapons in the game are quite normal and nothing really stands out, you have your typical weapons, Sword, Dual blades, Spear, Punching Gauntlets? I guess the gauntlets are sorta surprising, A naginata (a different type of spear), and a rifle. Club, A scythe and chain, Bow. Pretty much your usual setup of weapons, one thing from monster hunter that I really loved was the variety of weapons such as the hunting horn, gunlance, the switch axe, and the super large bow pew pew thing.\n\nOverall running a solid 30 FPS, All graphics to the highest, satisfactory combat similar to MH4U, the game looks nice as well.\n\nHeres my specs pretty obvious that I could run this game\nGTX 970 EVGA Superclocked AC 2\ni7-4790k 4.00Ghz\n16GB Ram\n64 bit windows 8.1\n\nMy brother runs this rig (my old pc)\nGTX 660\ni7 4820k 3.70Ghz\n8GB ram\nWindows 8.1 64 bit\n\nSolid 30 FPS all maxed settings\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes most definetly bring some friends along as that's what hunting games are great for. (leaving your friends behind to die) But do expect some issues here and there as it's newly released otherwise just wait out for fixes. Happy hunting everyone!\n\nAlso, this game does not support the mouse at this moment but hopefully they do add support for the game. A controller is HIGHLY recommended as it's much easier to play w/.","June 25, 2015","true","3.2"," 24 of 83 people (29%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","29","24","83","3","0"

The game itself runs at a locked 30fps (This might perhaps be modded out in the future I mean just look at the original Dark Souls) and while some people might complain about ''hurr durr muh 60fps pc mustard race'' I personally feel like the game itself works just fine at 30fps.\nIt was also stated yesterday that the game does have some issues with certain Nvidia cards in combination with Windows 8.1 (GTX 560, GTX 570 and GTX 980) and I happen to be running Windows 8.1 with a GTX980. During my first 20 minutes of gameplay I ran into a crash while I was going to the village but that could be fixed by running the game in Windows 7 compatability mode and after putting that on I have yet to get another crash.\nI've seen in the community that some people are having problems in the village with the frames going down as low as 15 and I do not have that problem on my rig soo the game runs at a constant 30fps.\n\nNow as a Monster Hunter veteran and hunting genre lover I personally felt like this game was worth the price but I understand that most of you probably feel like it's way too high because you already own the game on another system but for a first time player it really could have been worse.\n\nAs a whole I highly recommend this game if you are into the whole hunting genre as the weapons are really fun to use and the oni's are fun to hunt.\n\nHappy hunting everyone!","June 25, 2015","true","38.7"," 27 of 93 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","27","93","0","0"

It's much more fun to play with friends as the current online is nearly empty whenever I browse.\n\nTo all the people complaining of performance issues, I've had 0 and my computer isn't even all that new. Just make sure to run in windows 7 compatability if you have issues.\nAs for the 30 fps complaints, it's not even a big deal. 60 would've been nice but its not truly that big of a deal.\n\nDon't even bother to play without a gamepad. It's very similar to Monster Hunter but still different enough to feel like its own game. The combat is my favorite aspect of this game so far. It offers 9 weapon types; Swords, Spears, Bows, Clubs, Guns, Naginatas (Polearms), Chain and Sickle, Daggers, and Gauntlets. I myself went for chain and sickle. The move lists for the weapons are alot more expansive than Monster Hunter. You even get special attacks when you fill up your weapon gauge that allow you to stun the monster and hack off more limbs. Another change is the Mitama (soul) system. It acts fairly smilar to most gem systems. pick a socket and a soul and you'll gain certain abilities and passives. You can increase the number of souls you can equip as you upgrade your weapons.\n\nAll in all I've really enjoyed the time spent so far. If you're iffy about buying it after reading negative reviews, just ask yourself this, Do you like Monster Hunter? Have you always wanted to play it on PC with friends? Do you like faster paced Combat systems?\n\n8/10 so far. Completely worth it.","June 26, 2015","true","44.4"," 19 of 73 people (26%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","26","19","73","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rushfoxx/recommended/363130/","rushfoxx","RushFox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rushfoxx/","81 products in account","Gameplay: Plays like Lords Of Arcana. Which is basically a hack and slash Monster Hunter. Attacking feels great, the hit boxes are broad, and UNLIKE Monster Hunter, you can toggle being able to see enemy hp. There are a variety of weapons to choose from, and a variety of "classes" to equip. Each class offers different skills to use during battle such as: Attack boosts, defense boosts, party support, unique attacks. Each one levels up as you use it more. There are missions (which can be done both online and offline) that involve slaying small monsters, clearing waves, collecting items, and last but definitely not least, slaying large monsters (or Onis). This is where the game is the most fun. A party of four against a large enemy, just like Monster Hunter.\n\nSound: The game is primarily Japanese. This means all the dialogue has english subtitles.\n\nGraphics: Here's where people are complaining the most. The game is a little lacking in the graphics department and it is locked at 30fps. It's really no big deal, as the game still runs smooth enough (provided your specs are on par). 60fps would be lovely though. The game looks as it does on the PSVita, since it was orignially on PSVita/4.\n\nControls: Here's another issue with this game. The controls are intuitive, responsive, and fluid...on a controller. I would not reccomend playing this game on keyboard. Most annoyingly, you cannot type in text boxes with the keyboad, or navigate through a menu with the mouse.\n\nOnline: There are issues here as well. What's important is that the game runs flawlessly online. I haven't had any issues in the lobbies I played. Whether it was 2 or 4 players in the room, there was no noticable lag.\nWhat I have a problem with is the lack of chat. You are limited to quick chat commands. There's no way to type, no way to voice chat, and you can't even check another players steam profile to add them. If you want a party to be fully coordinated, you'll have to form it outside the game.\nWhat's also annoying about the online (and the lack of chat makes this worse) is that you have to exit the loby if you want to purchase, craft, or sell any items. So if you're trying to make a sweet sword, and you're not sure how many more parts you need for it, you'll have to go offline to check the blacksmith. You won't be able to tell your peers you'll be right back, and they may just assume you've quit.\n\nOverall, the game is very very enjoyable. A solid pc controller, a voice/text chat group outside of the game chat, and hopefully eventually some graphical optimization (fps unlock at least) would make the game even better.\n\n","June 26, 2015","true","8.5"," 33 of 109 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","33","109","0","0"

I haven't gotten super far into the game yet, but it seems promising and I've been enjoying it so far. This game is basically like Monster Hunter without all the unecessary fluff. Each weapon plays different and as a game by Toei, if you're expecting combat along the lines of Dynasty Warriors, you'd be mistaken. Each weapon handles quite differently from not only just simple things like attack speed and range, but also basically having different controls for each weapon. Though some button combos are the same, the result is different for each weapon.\n\nNow for all you people complaining about bugs, awful controls, and other stuff, the only problem I've had with this game is random crashing, which I'm sure they can fix soon enough. It also seems running in compatibility mode helps out with this. People complain about no use of mouse, but Dynasty Warriors was the same way. It just takes getting used to. My controller wouldn't even work for Dynasty Warriors but I just kept using the keyboard and I don't even care anymore. If you're that stuck up about it, go buy yourself a controller (Xbox 360 probably). It's a surprise you already don't have one if you play tons of different games on PC. Can't afford one? Not my problem, not Toei's problem. I've heard there's an issue with not being able to setup your own keybindings, and for that, I have nothing against since I myself had to change some key binding to play Dynasty Warriors on the keyboard.\n\nOh, and the last thing. Locked at 30 FPS? Who cares\n\nSo basically, this game is great, the only problem which is completely fixable is the random crashes. No need to whine about problems you could easily work around or that don't even matter","June 27, 2015","true","85.8"," 17 of 69 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","17","69","2","0"

Now I can write an actual review.\n\npros\n- They did a great job upgrading game graphic to match PC port.\n- A game story is straight forward easy to get along.\n- Various weapons and soul skill to try out and mastered.\n- Good Action Game and multiplayer online supported.\n- Game run smooth with moderate pc spec. [tried it on Laptop, it laggy though]\n\ncons\n- A little bit too easy if you have experiences from other similar title[Capcom].\n- 1920*1080 is an highest resolution.\n- 30 fps Cap -> 60 refresh rate.\n- A price is considerably high compare to other portable game port.\n- Furthermore this game comes with high price DLC.\n- Not compatible to play with Mouse. I use joypad myself so I don't really mind.\n- I had try to play with keyboard once and yes, it is absolutely painful.[badly binding design]\n\nBugs, Fixed and Edited\n----------------------------------\n- G-sync monitor and free sync once affected its frame rate.\n- Now they lock game's frame at 30fps.\n\n- Game keep crashing in a few minutes after loading a save.\n- After Updated to win10 crash still occurs.\n- Changing a compatiblity to win 7 isn't help.\n\nA solution\n---------------\nI just tried this out and let game runs for a few hours so far it hasn't crash yet.\n\nWhat I did is\n+ After win10 upgraded I noticed my ToukidenKiwamiLauncher menu tab layout is massed up.\nI didn't bother to check it properly up until now. [all tab name are hidden until your cursor over it]\n+ A new tab have been added next to "Graphic setting" called "Special Setting"\n+ There is an option called "Stablization" inside this tab\n\n- I switched this option "ON"\n- I change my monitor refresh rate from 144 to 60 while playing this game.\n- Also close G-sync and nvidia fps counter.\n\nThese seem to aid my problem. Anyone who have Crashing issue pls try this out.","June 26, 2015","true","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played the psvita and ps4 version and was satified with the gameplay however pc version just crashed too much. i do love this game and would reccommend it to everyone to play just not at full price and even so i would recommend people to try it out when it is on sell. ... when it is around 50+% on sell... locked at 30 fps and the graphics are decent","October 9, 2015","true","18.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Game runs smooth at 30 FPS, A lot of things like character creation, mission desk, game save method is the same as in Monster Hunter series. Combat is a bit better than I expected.\nSeems to be really good game and I hope I won't be disappointed because the price is damn high.\n\nreview update 1\nI played it for 2 hours and I didn't experience any problem so far except the game window always scales to system resolution regardless of resolution set in game and this game doesn't support my resolution (1280x800).\nAbout gameplay it's exactly between MH and God Eater.\nYou choose 1 weapon at time, maps are divided into small areas, you have to aim and evade attacks like in Monster Hunter.\nYou can take NPCs on missions and lock camera on target like in God Eater. There is no mining, plant gathering or fishing - you just pick up shining objects laying on the ground.\n\nupdate 2\nJust completed chapter 2. Awesome game but be sure to have a controller XD\nThe only thing I don't like is the NPCs are too strong. You can just stand and watch and three of them will clear every mission in less than 15 minutes. It's not fun so I try soloing or take only one NPC but in story missions you cannot change party members.\n\nupdate 3\nok, it is more difficult after chapter 4 but game crashed 2 times recently :(","December 23, 2015","true","467.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat is nice, not as complicated as MH, but still nice. The characters are good, and actually have voice actors, good ones at that! (but dont go expecting an english dub) The whole game gives a good feel of both monster hunter and dyansty warriors.\n\nOf course, these arent the reasons why i would not recommend this game.\n\nThe game, at the moment of release day, is a massive mess of bugs, and un-necessary limitations. The FPS Cap of 30 is awful. This game can EASILY run at 60FPS and be fine. Not to mention, even with the 30 cap, you will usually see it drop down to 15, even with every graphic on low. And dont try to run it windowed, that makes it worse. The game isnt compatible with windows 8.1, which forces you to go to the files and change the compatibility to windows 7. The particles, doesnt matter wether you have a GTX 980 or An AMD card, will crash your game if you dont have them on low. The game its self, looks like it was ported from the vita, not the PS4.\n\nAll around, it saddens me that a game with SO much potential has such a small playing community because koei tecmo screwed us over with another awful port. Hopefully they ACTUALLY try to fix this one, but if they dont, just get it on the ps4 folks, its still definetly not a game you will want to miss out on if you want to get into MH, or want a MH game thats not on nintendo.\n\n\n\n(and no, my icon is not trying to troll)\n\n\n\nEdit: It would appear the biggest issues that people have had, besides the 30 Frame lock, have been fixed, so i think i can finally recommend it.","June 27, 2015","true","43.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

WTF with 20fps on random occasion!!!\n- In-game achievement bugs, I can't stand playing game with bugs on achievement. It can ruin your entire game when you discovered that one of the achievement you should have unlocked doesn't unlok as it should after you already played 19 hours. F__king 19 HOURS!!!\n\nAt least fix an achievement/medal bugs and I will thumb up your game again Koei-Tecmo.\n\nEDIT: with the latest update, the achievement bug is fixed but the framerate issue still exist. So As I have said, the game is worth playing now.","July 18, 2015","true","204.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","7"
