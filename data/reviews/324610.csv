Character movements are painfully slow, down to the bad voice acting. None of the voice actors seem too interested in actually bringing the story to life, which is a shame, because they could have done The Shopkeeper a lot of justice. When playing I feel trapped as if it were Ground Hog's day, perhaps that was the intention of the developer, but it does not bode well with me. Often I find myself struggling to stay awake while attempting to give an earnest play through. I simply cannot do it. The Shopkeeper had potential for greatness, but unfortunately, I cannot justify anyone spending money on it.","October 23, 2014","false","2.5"," 85 of 97 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","85","97","2","0"

And that's interesting and thought provoking, but The Shopkeeper doesn't give you enough to work with to be able to derive any meaning out of its characters or handful of repetitive lines of dialog. As a game stuck on repeat at some point you would assume having seen the sames scenes play out so many times you might eventually grasp what the greater purpose, if there is any, of all this must be. But I never found that moment of clarity, as I continuously attempted to cross dialogue paths while arriving at the same non explanatory ending (for lack of a better term) ad nauseam.\n\nThere's something fascinating to me about The Shopkeeper, as if something is hiding just behind the curtain and I've merely failed to procure how exactly to pull it away, but for as far as I can tell these lofty ideas are little more than figments of my imagination conjured up to fill the vast emptiness of the experience. Whether or not my hypothesizing is accurate to any degree I have no way of knowing, but if not, they've concealed the greater explanations and revelations so effectively as they may as well not exist at all.","October 26, 2014","false","0.7"," 39 of 41 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","39","41","0","0"

How he does this is he makes up a story about the item in question that will appeal to the nature of said ♥♥♥♥.\nIf you fail to do so he will go away without buying anything only to come back the next day so you can take another crack.\n\nThe reason I'm explaining this is so the reader is left with no illusions. I understood the concept and the story, I just didn't think they were adequete. It is a mini-game you would put into a much larger adventure game, not much more.

The fact of the matter is that this isn't much of a game however. There are no puzzles to solve, just a random process of trial and error.\nThis is a shame.

The Shopkeeper takes a path very close to Dear Esther when it comes to design. The storytelling plays a more important role in the game than the actual gameplay. It took me a while to figure out what the hell was happening in the first place, but after the fog has been lifted I let myself enjoy the little stories.\n\nNeedless to say this game is not for everyone. I wouldn't even say that if you liked Dear Esther you will love The Shopkeeper. However for the ones who can overlook the little to no gameplay this 'game' has, it can provide some quality time from a small indie studio. It also has a quite low price tag, so if you are looking for something unusual this might worth to take a look at.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are not intrested in any of the above then I would say, just buy a bottle of coke from the money, and enjoy that for the evening, because it is most likely to prove it more worthy for you than this game.\n\nIt is not for everyone.

In a title like The Wolf Among Us or The Walking Dead, for instance, there is a focus on storytelling and decision-making rather than traditional gameplay mechanics. The Shopkeeper takes that idea and pulls back even further in terms of interactivity, becoming a short-form choose your own adventure, where just a handful of different choices will guide the story in one direction or another.\n\nThe Shopkeeper presents us with a young businessman looking for an Antique to impress his Mother-in-Law. The titular Shopkeeper tells the story behind each item for sale in his store, and through a series of dialogue choices will explain the consequences of choosing one gift over the other. Pick the incorrect gift and the story will repeat itself, until the correct gift and conversational choices have been made and the credits roll.\n\nThe story is very short and simple. Of course, you won’t find the right present right away, so you end up in a sort of Groundhog Day déjà-vu cycle. Although you can only select from a handful of different gifts in the antiques shop, and only around nine different dialogue trees, this still throws up probably thirty or so possible combinations that can played through, and three marginally different endings. Many of the choices won’t change things dramatically, but a minor change in tone or voice, or one different line of dialogue lets you know perhaps you are moving in the right direction.\n\nThe problem is that the story is never particularly explicit. Even when the so-called “best” ending is achieved, you can’t really be sure what happened or why that approach was more successful than your previous ones. Being such a short story, you would have hoped that the writing would have been a little tighter and the conversations less nonsensical. This is probably down to the fact that the game must change depending on the combination of choices you have picked, but it feels like there aren’t enough different reactions to what you decide. This results in each subsequent play through feel too repetitive, and it becomes frustrating.\n\nDespite the fact that professional actors with extensive television credits have been used in-game, the delivery is quite poor overall. It all sounds very stunted and at unnatural, which adds to the feeling that each choice and reaction don’t flow together very well. The acting also lacks any real emotion and even when someone might be getting angry or desperate, there is a distinct lack of depth in the vocal work.\n\nThe sketchy art style doesn’t really suit the serious and stoic story-telling employed throughout the title, either. The muted colour palette at matches the sombre mood, but the cartoony backgrounds and character models betray the tone of the tale. There is also the inclusion of a notepad for reference, but the notes held within seem to have very little to do with your play through of the game and instead seems to represent the inner monologue of the Shopkeeper himself.\n\nThe Shopkeeper is a very uneven experience. Sadly, none of the elements seem to mesh together particularly well. There are also issues with the feeling that most of the choices you make don’t have much impact on the direction of the story. For such a short game where choice is the only real mechanic, your choices need to provide a lot more feedback and actually be significant. Instead, the minor plot differences, disappointing voice acting and sometimes incomprehensible writing combine to create a somewhat frustrating experience. The promised freedom of choice and replayability in this interactive story book is, unfortunately, paper-thin. Overall 4/10.","January 17","false","16.3"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","23","24","2","2"

I may have only played this one for two hours, but I believe I've found everything the game has to offer. And truthfully, I wanted to enjoy it... but I felt I was lost in a story that made little sense and wasn't captivating.\n\nThere are also the following core issues:\n- The fancy handwritten script can be extremely hard to read.\n- There's no option for subtitles. I usually play with audio anyway, but I always dislike it when games /force/ me to have the sound on.\n- There's also no music. Music adds so much to a game, or in this case, NOT having it actually takes away from the experience.\n\nThe achievements were also mostly based on repetition; the game had to be completed twenty or thirty times to get everything, and even then, there was little to no guidance on how to get the achievements, so it was mostly me stumbling around blindly clicking on things and hoping an achievement unlocks.\n\nThere are some high points, like the voice acting -- it's not great, or even good, but I've also heard much worse. The concept is also cool, though the storyline could have been fleshed out more. It doesn't even do it justice to storylines to SAY this game has a storyline, as it's mostly random tidbits of information about items in a fictional shop coupled with a minorly interesting, not-that-compelling dialogue between The Customer and his Mother-in-Law. Overall, I don't think I can really recommend this game, but if you insist on buying it, I recommend checking out the achievement guide I wrote in the guides section, mostly because it will limit the amount of frustrating repetition that is to be found in this game.","November 27, 2014","false","2.5"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","2"

The game is very brief, with a playthrough taking around 2 minutes. The full story is learned through multiple playthroughs, which could take about 30-45 minutes overall.\n\nThe gameplay in The Shopkeeper is minimal. You are immediately thrown into the story, without much idea what is going on. You can click on items to learn more about them, and also click on responses while you are talking to your Mother-in-law. After a round or two you will kind of get the gist of what you have to accomplish. There are about 4 total scenes, and you will not see every one on each playthrough. Once a round is over, you are thrown right back to the beginning of the story to start again. Eventually, you will achieve the desired result through your clicking and will see the ending.\n\nThe graphics look pleasing, but there was very little to create between the handful of scenes. The sound, voice acting in particular, is bordering on the line between grating and unbearable.  Lucky the game is short, because I probably would have had to turn it off just due to the voice acting alone in another few minutes.\n\nI cannot recommend The Shopkeeper. Although it is already offered at a low price, current $3, it just doesn't seem worth it. I spent a rather unenjoyable 30 minutes with this game, and would advise you to avoid doing the same.\n\nGrade: D","April 1, 2015","false","0.4"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

Sometimes, clicking would inexplicably skip dialog, making me miss things, other times, nothing would happen.

Did you think that would persuade me to buy this thing?"\nThe problem, at least from my perspective, isn't that I'm "too stupid to understand what this game is about" or that I "haven't seen the right ending" as one reviewer suggested regarding criticism of the game. I managed to complete the game with all achievements unlocked in one sitting in less than an hour. I get it, but like the quote above implies I just didn't find it very interesting.\n\nIt's a shame, really. I tend to like the point-and-click genre, and the art style was very intriguing to me. The lackluster voice acting and (at least to me) uninspired storyline left me wanting more from this game - but unfortunately it cannot seem to deliver, no matter how much I'd have liked to enjoy this.

While at first it seems like there is not much to this game, there really is. With each passing scene, new information is revealed that deepens the story line.\n\nClicking on objects in the game gives more information and it's up to the player to put  the puzzle together to move forward.\n\nThis game is good if you like to persist and you like puzzles that are not too obvious in a "hand holding" kind of way. The game isn't easy.\n\nThat said, it's NOT a bad game, as some have said. It's just conceptually a bit obtuse. It takes time to understand and get used to, and repetition does happen a LOT, so if you want a game that is more straightforward, perhaps pass on this title.\n\nBut I would recommend this game for people who like the point and click genre. It's simple, and repeatitive, but if you stick with it you can make your way through the story.   I CANT recommend it for anyone other than the point-and-click diehard fan.\n\nOne thing that I would improve is the voice acting. It's clear that the actors are reading, and it would be nice if the vocals were more polished.\n\nOverall a nice little game. But I can't recommend it for any more than a couple of dollars and an hour of time. To like this game you must be a point-and-click fan. Not so sure how a general audience would find the game.

The game felt slightly broken, with scenes never really tying together correctly. You're merely dropped in with no explanation as to what's happening. Apart from that there was very little to do, and gameplay boiled down to an occasional clock clicking or skipping of dialogue that came up previously, which is far from the "point & click" gameplay they claimed to offer. While the art is nice the repetition of scenes wears thin very quickly. If you want to experience this game for the art style then just look at the screenshots above, as these were the only settings I encountered while playing through. All in all, I can't say I'd recommend this one. Worse still, with their comparison they have sullied the once proud name of Antiques Roadshow, which is frankly unforgivable.","October 24, 2014","false","0.5"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

The titular Shopkeeper tells the story behind each item for sale in his store and through a series of dialogue choices, it will be explained the consequences of choosing one gift over the other. Pick the incorrect gift and the story will repeat itself, until you pick the right one and the game ends.\n\nThe problem is that the story is never particularly explicit. Even when the best ending is achieved, you can’t really be sure what happened or why that approach was more successful than your previous ones. This results in each subsequent play through feel too repetitive and it becomes frustrating... very frustrating.","April 20","false","0.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Also, the game needs a point. It has no point. Are you supposed to find the correct combination that ensures the customer buys the item? The only way to do that is through sheer guesswork as there's absolutely no clue given in the game what would work and what wouldn't.","February 5, 2015","false","1.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The only real challenge is in unlocking all of the achievements, and challenge is putting it mildly. In reality, it's just annoying. But, in a little over an hour, I did it. The different angles that you start the game from are annoying because you have no choice, which means there's no efficient way to complete the achievements, which are really the only game part of the game. The whole game is repetitive, but especially the dialog. If choosing different items in the shop and in the office actually led to completely different dialog, the game might be alright. But, given that no matter what choices you make, you'll hear essentially the same audio, it's pointless to have to repeat the game over and over again. The artwork is fine. The voice acting is fine.

The only options in the "Options" menu are for resizing the screen, resuming the game, and exiting the game. I've played for over half an hour and the gameplay still doesn't make any sense--I can never know when to expect the game will go to what scene or what I'm supposed to do in a scene to make things progress in a new way. Every area has a time limit. Exploration seems to be discouraged because you have only seconds to look around any given screen before the default dialogue for that location starts. The game also restarts itself again and again without prompting when you get to the end, which is never clarified as being the end.\n\nThe "Notes" don't help you figure out how to get different endings--they're just flavor text from what I've seen--and this game could really use some kind of hint system so the player won't be forced to use trial and error just to learn the game mechanics. You can't control the movement of any of the characters. The very few offered dialogue prompts are in only one scene, and they're as unintuitive as any of the other mechanics. The only hints I can give as to the gameplay are that clicking on an object in the antique store and getting its long story can sometimes effect the dialogue you get when you return to the store, but not always; and that clicking on an object in the mother-in-law's office can occasionally give you a different ending scene if you pick the right dialogue path.\n\nI've found none of the four characters to be likeable--the mother-in-law seems to have no positive dialogue paths that paint her as a likable person, the son-in-law is a failure and/or a jerk in every dialogue path he has, the gardener only has unkind things to say about someone he barely knows, and the antique shop owner doesn't have a lot of personality and is more of a storytelling device than a person--his only bit of backstory that I've found was from the gardener and the line had more personality than the antique dealer. The animations are jerky. The one true ending I've found had a cutscene that faded to black, played hard to interpret noises, went on to a scene that explained what happened, and ended with two scenes that didn't make any sense with the context.\n\nThe only positive thing I can think to say about this game is that the longer stories about the antiques are interesting, but good luck being able to trigger one. If you miss your chance at a long story you need to wait for the game to cycle through the mother-in-law area again; and, even then, you aren't guaranteed to end up back inside the antique shop. You could end up outside and have to wait for the game to play through again and hope you're not outside this time. Even if you do end up back in the shop after the mother-in-law scene they might talk about a different antique than the one you chose at first regardless of whether you got a long story.\n\nI got this game in a Humble Bundle and gave it a shot. I would not recommend going out of your way to purchase this game. It is barely playable and not enjoyable in its current state.","January 17, 2015","false","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But if you have it, it's a good option for a fast perfect game (achievements).\n\nHere's why: The game is utterly confusing and repetitive, where your choices change very little, from he choice of an item in the shop to the furniture in the office. The storylines are repetitive and therefore dull after the first time seen. Getting to the right answer only takes luck and a lot of patience but has nothing to do with your choice or it being a rational conversation either.\n\nAs for the User Experience I would rate it terrible, choices in the game are arbitrarily arranged and follow no order, you can't choose the way you enter the shop (bad because some of the ways choose the item in the story for you) and the notes are scribbles that sometimes can't even be read\n\nI finished the game with all achievements in ~100min (some people played even less), but luckily I got this game in a bundle so as I view it, was free.

They can be minimal, they can be short, they can have bad voice-overs or bad music. A game just needs to be fun, or at the very least, entertaining in some way. "The Shopkeeper" fails in every possible way.\n\nSimply put, the game is boring. This is a point-and-click adventure game with, perhaps, 5 screens to explore. Gameplay revolves around a short story that repeats ad infinitum. (It's a bit like the movie, "Groundhog's Day", except really short and uninteresting.) You have no control over your character. (It isn't even clear who your character is supposed to be.) There are only 6 characters in the story. Two of them, will never interact with you. Clicking on items will sometimes give an explanation... and sometimes it won't.\n\n...and... that's about it for gameplay. Oh, there is ONE dialog tree. Most of the time, the dialog doesn't change. You have to pick the correct item AND the correct dialog options in one run. Make a mistake? You must play through the entire sequence to start over.\n\nThe graphics are quaint, but poor. If all I'm going to see in a game are 5 screens, those screens should look amazing. Instead, we mostly have neutral tones of brown and gray.\n\nThis isn't a game, it's a story. A non-interactive story that provides choices but punishes you for making the incorrect decision. It just isn't fun.

Some of the main reasons people do no like this game are the following:\nPeople have the wrong expectations: The store description says point and click narrative (not adventure), but also mentions Classic Lucas Arts Productions (which is indeed wrong).\nPeople seem to be too stupid to understand what this game is about and where the focus lies (Fitting citation: "lost in a story without sense"): Lots haven't seen the right ending, which is eminent to the understanding. They are angry about the ever repeating sentences - but those are varying in little parts to supplement to the story (the Groundhog setting). And the playtime is short, about 3-5 minutes per try - but you will play it more than you will expect to get to the right ending!The game is not as simple as it seems: There are lots of situations where the perspective is shifting (from the shopkeeper to the customer and back); the short playtime of 3 minutes per visit is really fitting to represent the setting as a hopeless scenery for the customer; all the objects in the game contribute with their little background stories to the whole, involving macabre stories. And yes - there are no subtitles: but if you don't understand the whole conversation, it's not a big problem; wait 3 minutes and the story begins again ...\n\nWell, what's the conclusion: If you like a small point and click visual novel with a nice art-style, deep and black humor writing, an indie game with well done voice acting, where you try to buy an old antique for your mother-in-law in order to let her sponsor your business, then it's worth a try.\nBe prepared for a bad-tempered mother-in-law, a marked-by-life shopkeeper and a family tragedy with a surprising end (the right one!)!\n\nGame has achievements (some are hidden), in order to get them, the playtime is around 1-2 hours; if you manage to figure out the right end at your first playthrough, you are done in 5 minutes!\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor all gamers with niveau and courage to give it a try despite of all the negative reviews!","May 22, 2015","true","1.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Notice the "played"... well yeah this isn't really a game, nor is it a visual novel. It's uhmm... I'm not sure what it is, the "gameplay" consists of 3-5 screens divided in two parts. In the first part you click on various objects in the antiques shop and if you're lucky you get a little story about the object. The next screen is the conversation between the bad son-in-law buisnessman and his mother-in-law. First you get to click on an object and then select a dialog choice which is made of several options (a branching dialog). For the most part you'll get scolded or something like that and after that the story begins anew, and yeah that's it. It's incredibly tedious to get all 10 achievements, I only had the patience to get 6 of them.

However, there is very little "content" here and many problems with the way the ideas have been implemented and packaged as a for-money videogame.\n\nIf you've seen the movie Groundhog Day, imagine a version of that which is 5 minutes long with only about 5 camera shots and instead of being about learning how to be a great human being, the story's about Bill Murray having to guess the correct gift-object to give to his crush out of a choice of maybe a dozen. (And spoilers, no happy ending.)\n\nOr The Stanley Parable with 2% of the content.\n\nFactor in some amateur voice acting, minimal animation, a short background ambient sound which fades out and back in at each repeat instead of looping seamlessly, forced repetition of conversations that even the developer tells us to skip and literally one puzzle to solve: which hotspot do you click on at which time and which of the possible paths do you take through a 3-level dialogue tree?\n\nAll of the "Achievements" can only be won by brute force random clicking, while the game tells you aloud that you suck and chose poorly every couple of minutes and punishes you with the exact same 3 choices and audio clips for the Nth time.\n\nTo make things worse, for me it seems buggy. The scene would change back to the start room and the customer would complain that an object I hadn't even clicked on was totally wrong for him. Then I'd get an Achievement.\n\nHaving "won" (after more than an hour) it seems the secret message is about *not wasting our precious time* but I feel this minigame does just that and for very little reward. Glad it came "free" in a Humble Bundle. There are many nice things in how it was made and I look forward to the creators' next, more fleshed-out project.","January 13, 2015","false","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This isn't a game with any discernible mechanics. Its just a 5minute loop of meaningless audio.\n\n\nNOTHING LIKE A LUCASARTS POINT AND CLICK.  VERY MISLEADING DESCRIPTION.\n\nPROS:\n-Good voice acting (I didn't say great)\n-Good visuals (but then again there are only 4 screens so...)\n\nCONS:\n-No game mechanics (Game advances on its own; you just click and listen with no apparent effects on anything.)\n-Extremely repetitive (Consists of less than 5 minutes of dialogue that essentially loops).\n-Doesn't make any sense*\n\n*The "game" consists of you clicking on an object and hearing a random story about it. It then automatically advances into a branching dialogue tree which, once resolved, simply resets the game. There don't seem to be any mechanics in the scenes before the branching dialogue tree, and the selections in the tree don't seem to actually do anything. The only approach is to brute force it and just try every possibility to see what happens (I didn't bother, but based on others, apparently you just get a credits screen instead of the game looping again).\n\nThis can be called an "art" game at best, and even that is being incredibly generous.

In this case I did it even when I didn’t pay much during the winter sale.\nThe Shopkeeper has a neat premise but the execution is horrible. There is not much here but the repetition of the same sequences of three screens with the same short and uninspired lines of dialogue. The gameplay consists of nothing than clicking some random objects, listening to the same repetitive dialogues and waiting for some random achievements to pop up. There’s neither an enjoyable game nor any meaning or engaging story to witness here. It starts boring and continues being it with no hope for getting something out of the experience, as the game pretty much goes on on its own with the player only clicking randomly on the screen.\n\nFurthermore, the game mechanics just don’t work in the way they seem to be meant.

In this case I did it even when I didn’t pay much during the winter sale.\nThe Shopkeeper has a neat premise but the execution is horrible. There is not much here but the repetition of the same sequences of three screens with the same short and uninspired lines of dialogue. The gameplay consists of nothing than clicking some random objects, listening to the same repetitive dialogues and waiting for some random achievements to pop up. There’s neither an enjoyable game nor any meaning or engaging story to witness here. It starts boring and continues being it with no hope for getting something out of the experience, as the game pretty much goes on on its own with the player only clicking randomly on the screen.\n\nFurthermore, the game mechanics just don’t work in the way they seem to be meant. They won’t be explained in any way and therefore you are thrown into the game without anything useful to do and trying to figure out, what there is to do.

You're basically just trying different combinations until you find one that gets you an ending and that's all there is to it: you can see how it gets dull fast.\n\nSadly the story doesn't fare any better due to the characters having little background or depth: this means you'll find it quite hard to care what happens to the client or her mother-in-law since you'll never have a connection to them.\n\nThe Shopkeeper is sadly not good enough as a game or even an interactive story to recommend.\n","July 22, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
