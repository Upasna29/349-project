It's classic, vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up fun with a cool arsenal of weapons. It's not particularly difficult, but knowing which weapons to use at what points to rack up maximum damage makes for some fun strategy. And the music was great, too! Still gets me pumped!\n\nThis 2015 update of an old gaming staple, though, is lazy and improves absolutely nothing about the game.\n\nGraphically, the game is unchanged. The game is still locked to a low FPS rate, and though the resolution is configurable via the game launcher, there is no option for 1920x1080. There IS an option for a "smoothing filter" though this does nothing more than muddy the whole appearance of the game.\n\nThis version also still rocks the classic, midi tunes that made my young boy heart thump in anticipation of my airborne battles. However, the tracks don't loop seamlessly as I recall them doing in the original iteration. There seems to be a brief pause of silence at the end of a track before it picks up again from the beginning and it's quite annoying.\n\nOnto gameplay. At its core, this version of Raptor is excatly as the original. Controller support has been implimented, but it's sub-par. I still have to grab hold of the mouse on menus to know what I'm doing. On that note, though, when I do use the mouse, the on screen cursor will hit these mysterious vertical and/or horizontal "boundaries" past which cannot navigated without first giving the mouse shaking about the mouse pad. This I can't explain, but I've not had any similar issue with any other application on my PC.\n\nLastly, what has proven to be MOST troublesome about this half-♥♥♥♥♥ release is the completely unintuitive management of save profiles. I'm a gamer who saves often, and it wasn't long before I discovered that every time you save in this game, it does NOT overwrite the previous save, but instead creates ANOTHER save affiliated with the same name. Additionally, there's a very limited number of available save states, so if you forget to go back and delete previous saves from the main menu, you could came back to the hangar after having completed a mission only to discover that you CAN'T save your progress, and you can't delete previous saves without navigating back to the main menu, meaning that all progress from the previous save is inherently lost.\n\nIt's the sort of thing that makes you wonder if the developers every bothered to play their port before releasing it to the public.\n\nI would NOT recommend this port to any person wishing to experience Raptor: Call of the Shadows. I would instead tell them install DOSBox and run the original version- it's actually a bit better.\n\n","February 15, 2015","false","3.1"," 246 of 320 people (77%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","77","246","320","8","10"

Its one of the long lost classics of the 90s.\n\nIts amazing, the game itselfs is extremely long, with an amazing upgrade system to go with it. Missiles, rockets, laz0rz's, everything. Manage your currency and make sure to save your game! you will loose your progress if you dont.\n\nHowever, for a "2015 edition" its extremely lackluster. There is literally no new features in the game, it plays like its exactly as it was 15 bloody years ago. Is that a bad thing? hell no! but i expected at LEAST 1080p 60fps support. According to my steam meter, its running at 24fps. The way this game runs however, you dont feel it. Its easily playable, and for $5 this classic is a steal, I reccomend anyone looking for a nostalgic, or oldschool experience, grab this game!'\n\nI also need to mention the save system. Each save doesn't overright your last, it creates a new one. Tracking saves becomes a chore. This really is a lazy port, I really hope these issues are patched soon.","February 14, 2015","true","3.6"," 69 of 91 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","69","91","2","5"

I played it as a kid for hours on end and bought the 2015 edition out of nostalgia.\n\nEverything I remember as a kid is there. The one thing I don't remember being in the 1994 release are the bugs, specifically\n\nBuggy Mouse controls - Sometimes there is an invisible forcefield, that prevents your mouse cursor (or your plane) from being able to track across the length of the playing screen and is a problem with all screen resolutions. Now you can navigate the menus with ease with the keyboard, but when your playing the game proper, you don't want to contend with this whilst flying the plane, especially as the playing field can get pretty crowded at times.\n\nSave Bug - Saving after each mission was never a problem playing in the original release (and essential), so imagine my horror when confronting a error message for the first time saying I need to delete some pilot saves?\n\nI'm hoping these problems are rectified as they are annoyances to a great scrolling shoot-em-up, until then its a thumbs down for me.","May 17, 2015","false","1.4"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","28","31","0","1"

While I commend the effort of actually making a native Windows version of an older game rather than just tossing it running through Dosbox onto Steam like way too many publishers do, this one is unfortunately pretty botched. Sure, achievements are a nice touch, but there's inadequate options (why a max resolution of 1280x800?), the keyboard controls feel wonky, the mouse controls also feel wonky, and gods help you if you have multiple monitors since the game doesn't lock the mouse properly, meaning it can end up drifting over to another screen causing you to lose control over your ship. In this case, Dosbox might actually have been preferable.\n\nI'd gladly give this a positive review if future patches fixed the issues with Raptor's Windows version, it's still a pretty fun game even if I've played far better shmups in the dozen years since this came out, but the egregious technical issues just ruin the experience. It's probably more playable if you're only using a single screen, but even for those people I can't give it the recommend in this state.\n\nEdit: I've now attempted to play with a controller as well since I'd really like to be able to use this. The controller support is also broken. Wow.","July 25, 2015","false","0.3"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","0"

I got the Shareware version of Raptor: Call of the Shadows (I call it just Raptor) back in the 90´s with my first PC. I don´t know how long and often I played these first levels but I was so in love with this game. The graphics, the sound, the loads of weapons you can equip to your aircraft with is just amazing for an arcade shooter!\n\nBesides the standard machine gun you can buy air/air missiles which help you to get rid of other flying metal through the stages. When it comes to tanks, ships and all other stuff that´s on the ground you better switch to air/ground missiles which are the green ones :) There are also nuclear power bombs, scanners, plasma and laser weapons available. So you see quite a choice for a shooter that comes back from the 90´s\n\nSteering is quite simple - use your arrow keys for the directions, space for firing and the ALT key for switching weapons. You can configure the key mapping and even controllers are supported but ey, I played that back in 1994 with keyboard so you should stick to it! :)\n\nThe game has loads of stages I am not sure yet but I think it where 9 for each sector which is 27 levels in total. The sectors look all a little bit different, so they never get boring.\n\nBRAVO sector offers you a vast and aried landscape, TANGO sector looks like a jungle after you beat the first wave which looks  similar to the bravo sector missions but with more concrete buildings on the ground.\n\nThe last sector is calles OUTER REGIONS which is well anywhere but not on earth I guess. These missions look like the moon, mars and other planets and have the toughest enemies this game has to offer.\n\nI totally recommend this game if you like retro games and you can live with dated pixel graphics *yay*\n\n5 out of 5 foxes + the retro bonus fox   6/5 foxes!!!\n\n\nIf you like this review please join my retro games group on steam:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/retrogames8090","February 15, 2015","true","1.2"," 32 of 51 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","32","51","0","0"

You take other pilots' planes away with bullets, missiles, and/or plasma fire, then you buy more ways of taking your bullets, missiles and/or plasma bolts and putting them into enemy craft, and then you take their planes away again.\nI'm not really sure what it is that makes this game so special, but I've been coming back to it over and over again since the mid 90s.\nIt's got a very rudimentary character creation, several constantly active (when equipped) weapons and many more selectable ones that, fairly obviously, only fire when selected, and some really fun gameplay. There's definitely some nostalgia in there too.\n\nTwo slight annoyances:\n1) The mouse is really sticky for some reason. It never used to be in this game, but now the pointer will refuse to move past an apparently random point from time to time, only passing it when you swing back and forward again, as if to take a run up and break through an invisible mouse-barrier. Odd.\n2) The launcher lets you pick the resolution and run in full screen, but then sticks the image in the top right corner of the screen.

Mostly in the menus it would stick which is not that bad but sometimes while in the game itself it would stick causing some damage. Not good when you are being shot at by lasers. Second in the original game when you save it would save over the previous save file of that profile. This one does not causing me to go through each save file to see which is the right one and deleting the older ones. However with those problems aside I still love this game and the Easter Egg with Monkey’s, Lizards, and Cows with lasers are still in. For anyone who loved this game I recommend it and if you have not played it. The game is for a decent price. Buy it and try it out. Overall score 9/10 and in my top 50 games of all time and I hope someone picks it up and remaster it or even remake it with new enemies and levels.","February 21, 2015","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As such, it has issues that a lot of DOS-era games had; most notably, the framerate is just always going to be low, no matter how awesome your computer is. That's how the original was, and that's how it is now.\n\nDotEmu has added a High Quality filter which improves the framerate (to 25~30 fps), but it muddies up the graphics, which were way ahead of their time in 1994.\n\nThe game itself is a moderately deep top-down shooter; earn money, buy upgrades between missions, move to the next level once your aircraft is suffuciently armed and armored. The upgrade mechanics are still satisfying, even after all this time.","February 14, 2015","true","1.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I HIGHLY recommend playing this game with a controller, however, as the keyboard feels awkward for me, and playing with the mouse is atrocious. Also, it would be nice if it had higher resolutions; it doesn't go up to 1600x900 (the maximum resolution for my monitor), and I'm not a fan of playing games windowed. The HQ-filter isn't that great, either. Those quibbles aside, this is a decent DOS shooter... though it won't beat Tyrian when it comes to my favorite DOS shooter.","February 25, 2015","true","1.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

That doesn't matter because Raptor: Call of the Shadows was a game that I spent countless hours of my misspent youth playing, regardless of what Steam reports. This game is good, hands down, just take my word for it. This was the bomb back when I was just a 7 year old kid with nothing but a 486 and a lot of time (and baddies) to kill. When I didn't feel like playing my Sega Genesis, this is what I escaped to. Okay, enough nostalgia, phew.\n\nRaptor with it's stylized 2-D graphics and soundblaster tunes is a perfect pair of beauty and violent devastation. The customization choices of one of the most lethal and creative arsenal ever, is at your disposal. One particular thing I loved about this game is the amount of detail that went into each mission of the game, for a game originally released in 1994, Raptor was nothing short of an amazing, action-packed experience; To me it still is, to you, it definitely can be.","February 13, 2015","true","2.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

This is the 2010 edition with steam achievements and a different default key binding. With that said n done with, heres why its still a decent buy, and some of its drawbacks:\n\nIts a classic 2d raster shooter with varied areas, an array of different enemies combined with a well used color palette and an arsenal to put america world police in the shadows. It does however have a few issues in this release: The "HQ filter" that was introduced 5 years ago in the 2010 edition is just outright bad. In some cases it actually changes the size of the incoming enemy sprite in the name of smoothing out pixels. Its not a whole lot of a size difference, but enough to cause some overlapping(as an example I thought Id crash with an enemy several times, but instead it just passed through me on the side), and almost hilarious deforming of the artwork.\n\nSince it being a raster shooter, it dont scale up well. To the uninformed, a raster means youre practically scrolling through a really tall picture, and that picture dont change resolution as you scale up, making the game look worse now 21 years after its original release. Really guys, its been 21 years, can someone sit down and re-make a bit of this? <3\n\nOther than the slightly bigger resolution option and HQ filter(both from the 2010 version), the only thing to add that 5 on the end is the achievement list. Its still a great game, and I still love it, but its no real upgrade to this classic title hidden in the numbers.\n\nI also made my aquintance with a few bugs regarding the pointer, having it getting stuck in a mouse force field, sometimes this was only fixed by going back one menu.","February 13, 2015","true","4.5"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

At $5 normal retail, this isn't a bad deal for a game. No, it's not remastered, and the HD filter really doesn't do anything for actual graphics, but if you're a true fan of this game, 3d rendering doesn't mean ♥♥♥♥ in comparison to fun gameplay, which is why you should pick this dang game up.\n\nIf you aren't familiar with Raptor, this is an old-school shoot em up, one of the the first available for PC in the early 90's. It features the ability to accumulate points, that also act as your cash. You can use the cash to purchase ship upgrades, such as missiles, or auto-attacking guns to make some levels more manageable. The levels are fairly quick, but very replayable to find secrets, or accumulate more cash.\n\nTrue vets to the bullet hell games will find this one a little easier to play, especially compared to japanese games in the same genre, but veteran mode can pose a challenge. I remember beating this game; the excitement put the first pube on my balls, and ever since then, I felt vindicated as a gamer.\n\nGive this game a try if you have an extra $5, but don't you dare pass it up if it's on sale.","June 28, 2015","true","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I can understand that a full-fledged HD remake might be asking a bit much, but I'll take any actual improvements and modernizations I can get. I'd settle for a remastered soundtrack. But really, the only thing we get is an "HQ filter" that marginally improves the visuals. I'll be honest though, I only bought this release because I pirated the 2010 version, and I felt bad about it.\n\nOn to the actual game. If you've never played Raptor Call of the Shadows, it's a classic shoot-em-up that existed before today's bullet hells that permeate the genre with the likes of Cave and Treasure's offerings, etc. This means there's actually a reasonable amount of munitions being fired at you at any given time, with exception to some boss fights in the later difficulties.\n\nThe game is split up into three zones, each containing 9 levels, for 27 levels total. In between levels you can buy weapons and consumables from a shop with money you earn by shooting down enemies and destroying parts of the environment.  These weapons add variety to your arsenal from your standard air-to-air rockets all the way up to death lasers. These weapons are selectable during the mission, so you can adjust for various situations on the fly. However, having to cycle through all these weapons to use the one you want can be frustrating, so I recommend you only keep weapons you actually need and sell the rest.\n\nA few things the game does well includes a nice, gradual difficulty curve, gameplay is fairly well-balanced, and there's a nice degree of progression. The soundtrack deserves its own mention, because even with dated instruments, it's still pretty sweet. However, the sound rendering is such that lots of action can cause the music to muffle or jitter.\n\nIf you're using a gamepad, you'll need to reconfigure the defaults right away. The only button mapped correctly is the shot button. You'll have to use bombs and change weapons using the keyboard until you make corrections. Also, when making these corrections, use the Enter key on the keyboard, then push the button on the gamepad. Otherwise your mapping won't work for some reason.\n\nHere's the breakdown: if you already own Raptor in one incarnation or another, the 2015 release is not worth a purchase. However, for those just now discovering this title, it's a fun game that is completely worth an insta-buy.","February 22, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just having played the demo version, I've even played DOS games like Tyrian, Jazz Jackrabbit, & Wacky Wheels all from Shareware versions from early to late 90's. Raptor even though was just a demo, kept me coming back replaying it over & over! So finally I bought the full version on Steam!!\nThe features I love in this game are the ability to buy, sell, & upgrade with different items, weapons, & shields. Also earn credits as you progress thru each stage. When you complete a sector, your credits can be carried over to the next sector. There are 3 Sectors: Bravo, Tango, & Outer Regions. The 1st two sectors have 9 stages each. I haven't tried Outer Regions yet so IDK how many stages there are. Still I'm loving this game so far even if it's challenging!! I highly recommend this game to hardcore & shoot'em up fans!! :)\nGraphics: 4.75/5, Gameplay: 5/5, Sound: 4.5/5, Replay Value: 5/5.

For instance, using the mouse lets you move faster than you can with the keyboard, but it feels clunky and unresponsive. Also, there is no option to lock the cursor inside the window, so unless you play in fullscreen mode your cursor will leave the window and cause problems. To remedy this I tried playing in fullscreen mode, but the native resolutions for most monitors these days are not supported, and I still had some weird mouse issues where it appeared as though I was hitting an invisible wall with the cursor.\n\nThe save profile system is also extremely bad. You can only have a few saves, and there's no way to tell which one is the most recent one, unless you remember exactly how much money you had the last time you saved.\n\nI'm fairly certain that the controls were actually better the last time I ran this game in DOSBOX.","July 28, 2015","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music quality is worse and the frame rate is lower than in the original DOS version. Also, every time you save, a new copy of your pilot is saved and an additional save file is created instead of just updating your pilots current save state. The Steam achievements are pretty lame and make no sense (i.e. there is an achievement for giving the pilot a certain name). Some of them are even buggy and won't unlock the way they should. The mouse controls are also a bit dodgy. Sometimes the mouse gets stuck on a certain horizontal position. Don't spend money on this lackluster port.

It has everything it needs for this type of game. If you like classical Shoot'Em Up games this is for you. Fun and motivating. Definitely worth a buy. The 2015 Edition adds Steam Achievements. Graphics can be improved with a HQ Filter (then the game looks slightly different than in the screenshots). The game works fine with a gamepad. There are three different zones with nine levels each (27 levels total). The game becomes quite a challenge if you don't find a way to collect money and upgrade your ship (18 items available in the shop). Collecting items and selling them in the shop will help you out (the only time you can't use a controller is for selling, you need the mouse). You can buy up to five shields, there are different weapons available for air and ground targets (or against both). Some of the weapons are always equipped, others you can switch during combat. A little bit annoying are the limited savegame slots (you have to delete old savegames first) and that you can't really distinguish them (no titles, no dates). I owned this game back in the 90s but never really played it (I think it was a shareware version just with Bravo sector levels). When I was buying it for Steam I didn't even think I would play it for hours, really a great classic game that, playing it for several hours now, exceeded my expectations, addicting gameplay. I think you can have up to ten hours of casual fun with this game to play it through and unlock the achievements.","May 28","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
