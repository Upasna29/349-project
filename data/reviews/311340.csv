Why are you here, then? Why do you continue to scroll through them while your memory betrays you? You enjoy reading reviews, that's why."\n\nI'll get straight to the point. This review's main goal is to address common misconceptions.\n\nAmount of Content:\nGround Zeroes offers 7 missions: one main story, four side missions with different objectives, two extra side missions that are aimed at the fans of the series. Each mission has two difficulty settings (hard unlocks after beating normal), secret collectibles/objectives and unlockable trials (challenges). Throughout all missions you'll be dealing with only one location: Camp Omega, which is a fairly large facility. Each mission has it's own time of day.\nIf you like playing your games at a medium pace and you never had contact with this game before then you'll be able to complete all 7 missions in 5-10 hours+. If you're willing to spend time to get 100% completion, get most of the rewards and read/listen to the story then you might end up with 15-20 hours+ on you. However, it's possible to speedrun all 7 mission in ~1 hour (that is, if you know what you're doing). If you buy Phantom Pain alone then you won't be able to access Camp Omega and it's missions through it as they're avilable only for those that purchased Ground Zeroes (meaning this is a prologue and not a demo). However, if you purchased both then you'll be able to visit Camp Omega with all your Phantom Pain upgrades, not to mention special bonuses.\n\nPerformance & Settings:\nRuns on systems that are below minimum system requirements. Well optimized, but could've had even higher level of detail / drawing distance settings (some visible popup of small items). One common complaint are increased amounts of depth of field (blur / out of focus). It's easily "fixed" by decreasing Screen Filtering to High.\nFully playable on K&M but could've had a slightly better control scheme (currently there's some sensitivty bug when aiming while zoomed). Minority of people experiences some compatibility issues some of which were caused by bad system configurations, but some are legit and there most likely will be a compatibility fixing patch.\n\n\nMetal Gear is a legendary franchise, Ground Zeroes gives you a tiny bite of Phantom Pain and from here it only gets better. If you're into stealth, "tactical espionage action", shooters or just good stories then you should certainly get it. The game gives you freedom to choose your own path and your own tactics / playing style, be it complete stealth no kill or running around shooting rockets and riding tanks.","December 20, 2014","true","30.4"," 602 of 685 people (88%) found this review helpful 80 people found this review funny","88","602","685","80","7"

The steam release for me was really a way of supporting development on The Phantom Pain as I didn't really think there much else I could experience that I haven't already done but boy was I wrong!\n\nAfter 100%'ing the steam release of MGSV: GZ I'm happy to say I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this title to any Metal Gear fan or someone who's looking for a photo realistic, infiltration game with a lot of mystery.\n\nOkay let's get the big obvious one out the way. You CAN complete the MAIN mission of this game in less than five minutes pretty easily but this is certainly a title of quality over quantity and considering the quality of this port? It's 5 ♥♥♥♥ing stars my friend!\n\nThe official reasoning of the existance of GZ as a standalone title when it was originally going to be a tutorial intro for TPP is that GZ is radically different in playstyle to previous MGS titles and the team wanted to ease people in to this new style of stealth. Let's be real, that's bull. GZ IS however a great test in which the team received A TONNE of data and a lot of finance for development of TPP and to me that's great! They made a solid experience with GZ and can take further refinements to make TPP even better!\n\nGround Zeroes is a fantastic showcase of the Fox Engine's capabilities and how friendly it is for both developer and consumer! You take one look at GZ and you think "Wow! VERY realistic graphics! Doubt my old spud of a PC could run that..." and here's the beauty of this port, you most likely can. While I can run it on ultra and at a over 60 FPS average, I've seen people who don't even meet the MINIMUM specs on the store page and they run it absolutely fine! You don't need a silly SUPER ULTRA MEGA RAM THROTLING PHYSX 50GB VRAM 2 TITAN i7 10.00 Ghz setup at all and I find that jaw droppingly impressive, especially when GZ is practically Kojima Productions' first contribution to PC gaming for a LONG time (Like what? MGS 2 Substance??)\n\nThe gameplay (while taking a few moments to adjust if you've played MGS since the start) is great! You are truly in the thick of it and it is your decision making, actions and ability to adapt that'll decide on your success or failure. Gun handling and animations of you using them give you a respect for the weapon. I personally love seeing the sniper rifle on my back! While it is an offensive weapon and I like to ghost my runs, it's nice to just hold it!\n\nThe sound effects and graphics are amazing! GZ is a game about detail. Nothing is just simply slapped on or tacked in. It's there for a reason and it's done to a level of near perfection. For example, you have binoculars that are used to zoom in and scout enemies, vehicles and things like security cameras up ahead. You get a number of 2 zooms on it that really close in on your target. Now say you go and knock out a dude and you just feel like popping out the binos for a closer look-see. You instantly get a close up shot of the guys face but then you zoom in TWICE and the image is still SO clear to the point you actually see the pores of the person's skin, it's that crazy! And it's that level of detail in imagery and the believeable sound effects that accompany everything from the rain, to footsteps in the wet mud to footsteps on metallic stairs to even a light bulb beaming and it's hinges creaking when it turns! Nothing is left out. You get so much information as an infiltrationist that you can't help but be in the situation. You are there, feeling the wind and rain on your face,\n\nAs a teaser for TPP, GZ does a lot to fuel the hype and while I DO have my issues as an MGS fan (My Snakeu~ voice) GZ is the level of quality and passion that I really wish will one day be the industry standard, because it's games like this that further the level and reason as to why games ARE the ultimate form of entertainment and immersion. No more annual cash cow IPs.

As I'm sure you've heard, the game is incredibly short. I knew this going in, and intentionally took my time. I was still able to finish it in an hour and ten minutes.\n\nGranted, the "story" is supplemented by several side missions (only playable after you finish the story) which range from meeting contacts to rescuing agents, finding intel, destroying facilities, or even assassinating different people (whom you must identify from pictures). All in all, it's several hours of gameplay.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself? Honestly, it's pretty fantastic. Combat is tight, stealth is difficult and rewarding, from what I've seen, the AI is very smart and pretty perceptive, none of that "hide three feet from their face" you get from "stealth" in games like Skyrim. If you aren't hidden, they'll spot you from a hundred yards, and they'll investigate. Very good AI.\n\nThe game boasts an "open world", but the open world is a single prison camp on Cuba. The camp is not especially large, and some of the features new to  the Metal Gear franchise are pretty useless as a result, like Snake's new ability to drive vehicles (that said, I did enjoy the AI's use of vehicles in patrols and transportation).\n\nThe screenshots look pretty fantastic, right? You'd think that there's no way you could get your rig to do something like that. I'll admit, my computer is pretty decent in regards to gaming, but it often lags behind on newer titles. This game, however? It runs amazingly. Seriously, this might be the best optimized game engine I have ever played. I was getting those graphics at high FPS. Only in a handful of occasions did the game ever stutter, and these events were brief and far between.\n\nFor the story quality, there honestly isn't that much. The game is literally, with no exaggeration here, "Go here, get this guy, bring him to the chopper. Go there, get that girl, bring her to the chopper. Cutsene. Credits." At best, it's a demo/prologue of Phantom Pain. At worst, it's an epilogue to Peace Walker. The game takes place right after the end of Peace Walker, and centers around the rescues from a Cuban base of two characters from Peace Walker. The game does include some backstory which you can view, which is nice, but people who played PW (such as myself) will probably appreciate the characters more, and feel the impact of certain events near the end much more.\n\nNow, the final verdict: The game is fantastic, and that only makes it that much more painful that there's so little to enjoy. I'm going to give it a different rating based on the price. If it's on sale for five bucks, I'd say it's a must-buy. If it's on sale for ten, I'd give it some thought. For twenty? A flat-out no, unless you're an absolute die-hard fan. I'm giving it a thumbs up for in general, as it is a good game, but if you aren't able to get it on sale, I'd suggest you just go ahead and skip this one; buy the Phantom Pain when the game is worth the price. Watch a playthrough on Youtube. It'll only take an hour.\n\nEDIT: Fixed some weirdly worded sentences.","January 2, 2015","true","8.3"," 205 of 226 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","205","226","6","9"

In Ground Zeroes you play as Snake on a dangerous mission to extract to child PoWs from a US Blacksite in Cuba. You can approach this mission in two ways, get in and out as quietly as possible or rain hellfire upon the Cuban base, the outcome will be the same. As well as this main mission there are some side missions to complete afterwards which involve killing certain targets, finding intel etc.\n\nJust want to point out I have very little experience with the franchise, Peace Walker (PSP) is the only MGS game I've played and I never completed it so I'm effectively new to the series.\n\n+Amazingly good graphics\n+Freedom to choose your approach to a mission\n+Provides a nice introduction to Phantom Pain\n+A fair few different weapons to find/unlock and use, each leading to a different playstyle\n+Grabbing enemies for melee allows you not only to kill or knock them out but also to allows you to use them to attract other enemies\n+The Island can be explored at any pace that you like, you can rush your objective or take your time and kill every last guard\n+Stealth is very sastisfying but open combat can also be quite fun\n+Several drivable vehicles\n+When they work the controls are good, more on that later (Gamepad)\n+Good AI that provide a challenge to remain hidden even on Normal\n+Stealth mechanics are great, shadows and tall grass hide you as well as they should\n+Very well optomized, my mediocre rig can run it on High at 30FPS\n\n-Controller support is down right disgraceful. Firstly, the cursor doesn't disappear if you're using a control and it's stuck on the loading animation which gets rather distracting, I had to use a .bat file to hide it while playing which really is not acceptable. Secondly, I found that the game stopped responding to about half of the Gamepad's inputs after around 20-30 minutes of gameplay\n-There isn't much story to the game and what little there is is hard to understand if you're new to the series, even with the backstory provided\n-It's incredibly short, the main mission took me an hour and a half to complete (mainly because I had no clue what I was doing) and the side mission are also pretty short\n-The bit at the end of the game, after you leave the Island is basically just an advert for Phantom Pain which made GZ feel more like a demo than an actual game\n\nWorth Noting:\n-There's a very disturbing cutscene that is most certainly not for the faint hearted\n\nVerdict:\nWorth Purchasing On Sale (7/10)\n\nA good stealth action game that has amazing graphics, lots of freedom in how you play, great stealth mechanics, good AI and is very well optomized. The lack of content means anyone new to the series should definitely get it on sale but I'm sure diehard fans won't mind shelling out a little extra.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews?\n\nEl K.","June 21, 2015","true","2.6"," 347 of 408 people (85%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","85","347","408","14","20"

This is quality port right here, no crashes, stuttering or unstable frame rate. Running it on the highest settings at 60 frames. Its looks fantastic and its graphically superb.\nIt has full Keyboard+Mouse support or the 360 gamepad.\nThe sound quality is amazing, same with the voice acting. Kiefer Sutherland does a great job voice acting Snake. It was a little shocking at first because i'm so used to the voice of David Hayter, but i got along just fine and i believe Sutherland will live to everyone's expectation in this game and The Phantom Pain.\n\nThe game might be a little bit short but the story is pretty good (If you played Peace Walker, you will understand).

What I'm really interested in is an AI system that has context and situational awareness. This game has both. The main mission takes place during a hurricane, naturally this gives the AI reduced sight/hearing and what have you. I'll give a very brief example of the AI's contextual awareness.\n\nAfter getting spotted and going into the, as I understand it, new slow motion 'second chance' system where you can take out the enemy that spotted you and go unnoticed, I shot the unlucky guard in the face with a suppressed weapon. Minutes later I intercept a radio transmission from the control tower the the guard I just took out. From what I can tell each guard is assigned a number 'Delta 1, Delta 2' and so on. Since the guard they were radioing was out of commision, they sent another guard to check on him. Soon they found the body.\n\nIn most stealth games you'd expect them to see the body and then either that guard doesn't tell anybody and searches for you, or other guards that have no idea what happened all know you're there. This game was different.\nHe assessed the situation and radioed back to the tower that he died of a gunshot wound and since nobody reported hearing one, concluded that the intruder responsible must be using a suppressed weapon. After hearing this information, the entire base went on alert with sirens going off all over the place and backup arriving just a minute later.\n\nMost stealth games these days have me feeling pretty confident that I can hide around a corner and I won't get spotted. This is not the case for Ground Zeroes. If you want to get 20 feet inside this base without getting seen or heard, you need to find a vantage point and survey the area for a good 5 minutes, tagging enemies, trucks, watch towers ect.\nThis is as true to life as any stealth game I've played has come for me in the past 20 years. If you like MGS, this is worth checking out to get a taste of the Phantom Pain. If you like stealth games, there's enough here to keep you busy without knowing the setting or story.\n\nThis is just an example of how advanced this AI is for this type of open world setting. I'm a new fan of the MGS games and other than the Metal Gear Acid 'board games' for the PSP is my first time playing any MGS game. I can already say that without a doubt, I'm buying Phantom Pain when it releases and for stealth lovers, this is a lovely distraction from the wait until Phantom Pain comes out.","January 9, 2015","true","10.4"," 131 of 143 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","131","143","6","0"

Why is that? Whereas TPP is big, bloated and bogged down by superfluous gameplay elements (e.g., base management), GZ is tightly focused. Instead of trying to do many things, it only does a few things and does them well. Everything, from the relative simplicity of the gameplay to the open but not "open world" environment, adds to the illusion of being a stealth action hero.\n\nWhen I play GZ, I'm not thinking about checklists, base-building requirements or how long it takes to unlock the absurdly powerful weapon no one really needs by the time they get it (all of which carry an uncanny and unpleasant resemblance to microtransaction-based mobile gaming -- but I digress). I'm thinking about how cool it is to sneak through a base of Marines in the middle of a rainstorm. What's more, I don't feel the need to Fulton extract everything in sight. I can simply focus on the action.\n\nYes, it's only a prologue. But GZ is a smarter, tighter game. That's all there is to it.","May 3","true","52.8"," 113 of 124 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","113","124","2","7"

SNAAAAAAAAAAAKE!!!!\n\n+Graphics\nA japanese game with a perfect performance and it's one of the best examples of how is a good port, what is happening?\nAh yes, NVIDIA support <3.\nI tested the game in two different pc's (1st: GTX970, i5 2500K 4.5Ghz, 8GB / 2nd: GTX560Ti,  i5 3570 3.4Ghz, 8GB) and both runs the game smothly at 60fps and with everything in High and Extra High. It's incredible how good is this port. Very nice job from Kojima Productions and the graphics are incredible, the lightning effects are absolutely awesome.\n+Story\nThe main mission is very short... It's like if you cut just the cargo part of MGS2 and put it on a "different ¿game?", let's be honest it's just a demo of The Phantom Pain but in my opinion and as very fan of the series that cliffhanger at the end deserve that 13 euros I paid for this on the sales.\n+Extra missions\nYou also have some extra missions and two top secret missions and that ones are very funny, I dont want spoil but if you are a fan of the saga you will enjoy a lot that top secret stuff.\n+Gameplay\nIt's MGS4 but even better. I love the animations of this game for whatever you do is super smooth and the transitions between them are very good done.\nThe CQC is very fun and even more if you have several enemies around you. Dat slow motion for the CQC... <3\n+Map\nThe first time you play and they let you at that military base gives you the feeling of something very huge. It's true that after some hours playing you'll realize that the map it is actually quite small but the first impression playing the GZ mission is very spectacular.\n\n\n-Duration\nIt's a demo, benchmark or whatever you want call it of The Phantom Pain. That's all. Buy it with this in mind or wait hoping for a pack of Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain.\n-No sound options\nI dont know the reason about this... It's just very weird you cant configure nothing of the sound in the game, voices, sfx, music... Nothing, so you will open the windows volume mixer for this D:\n-Kaz\nKaz... I like you but man... Shut up a little bit please.\n\n\nLike I said if you are a fan of the saga and you cant wait more for play some MGS on PC, buy it but keep in mind this, it is a demo. Now it's your call decide if this deserve your money or not. I enjoyed this a lot and Ground Zeroes it's just the confirmation of I'm going buy The Phantom Pain instantly when comes out.\n","December 26, 2014","true","18.3"," 190 of 230 people (83%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","83","190","230","17","4"

After even Raiden making its debut on PC gaming this year, finally the main series is back. But this time is Big Boss himself, arriving for the first time on PC. But is Ground Zeroes worth? It’s almost certainly that you saw people on internet calling it a “demo” for The Phantom Pain, the main “V” game arriving next year (which will be available for PC too). I had played GZ for 30 hours on PS3 and 100% complete(and you can see I’m a big of the series by looking at my steam profile too) it so I prepared this review! Ground Zeroes is the Prologue for TPP, presenting the new features on the series, like the open-world stealth, usable vehicles and new HUD. GZ have beautiful graphics using the new Fox Engine from KJP, it’s really amazing, and for sure the illumination is one of the most impressive ever seen. The gameplay is smoother than the other MGS games, adding vehicles (In GZ you can use jeeps, trucks, APCs and can call for Heli support). You have now your IDroid which you can use to see the in-game map and to use other features like mission info, walkman, etc. The soundtrack is epic, and the cutscenes like in other MGS games are amazing, the ending is a good link for The Phantom Pain, the PC port is amazing, probably one of the best ports of the year, if not the best; and in Camp Omega you have all-new features like binoculars to mark enemies, destructible scenario in some structures and some collectibles. The only bad thing about the game is the short story. Depending in how you play it will take 1-2 hours to complete the main mission, so if you only play main missions on games don’t buy GZ. But if you like to explore there are good 6-8 hours to complete all missions and 20 hours to 100% the game (which is a good time). The game have almost no bugs and now on PC there is support for beatiful 4K and modding! Kiefer Surtherland voice acting is actually good too. I think that he is better to play Big Boss as the game is darker, so, after all, it’s a good voice acting(of course probably David Hayter maybe would be better).As this is a “prologue” there is some features from the previous games that are not included, besides this adds more things. There is no Cardboard Box, knocking on walls, funny items, knife, etc. But all of those we’ll be included in TPP. Camp Omega feels alive too! Soldiers are always doing something, like talking to each others about recent facts and eventually even tips for the objective. It's a cool system. And there are pretty animations. New animations and mechanics includes cool CQC moves, refined interrogation, and new and realistic crawling animations, where snake actually moves to where you are pointing the gun. The AI is one of the most impressive in gaming, the guards working and investigating, mostly on hard difficulty to have a real stealth experience (this series being one of the pioneer in good AI) And if you wanna catch up with the story for the other games, there is a section on menu for that! There is also a few collectibles to search in Camp Omega, including nine XOF patchs, that will unlock two extra ops (besides the four side ops). These Extra Ops are all for fun. It's a good tribute to MGS1 in Dejà-Vú mission, with a lot of challenges to complete, like finding and cleaning all MGS logos, and a lot of easter eggs, like playing with Solid Snake model from MGS1 and even Gray Fox model! And the other is Jamais-Vu, which adds pretty action to the game as you contro the cyborg Raiden, which some little changes to the mechanics, like running, and Raiden is a Cyborg. The four Side Ops are really cool too. They ar eunique, besides the fact that all of them pays on Camp Omega. There is an aciton-packed mission to destroy Anti-Air Emplacements, two cool stealth based missions where yoiu have some targets and a unique mission that you fire from the chopper while defending and then rescuing an agent of yours. The cool thing is that the agent is actually....  MR. KOJIMA!. All of those missions have highly replayability and there is a lot of things to find, easter eggs and ways to complete them. There is too another collectibles, like cassete tapes, and special weapons by getting some ranks in each mission. There are cool songs from previous games that can be unlocked and played in a mission, or even custom songs from your computer! There is now doubt that the game quality itself is unquestionable, but what about the price-benefit? Ground Zeroes price is actually good for those who are gonna explore the game and play all the missions, but if you are just gonna beat the main mission, it’s not recommended. But after all, Ground Zeroes is an amazing game, with new mechanics that prepares us for the amazing The Phantom Pain next year. Besides story being too short, is a good taste for MGS on PC.\n\n\n+Amazing Graphics with all-new Fox Engine\n+Smooth Gameplay\n+Epic Soundtrack (including known songs from the series)\n+Open-World\n+Variety and lots of weapons and equipment\n+A lot of background story\n+Good PC port\n+Binoculars, vehicles a lot of new animations and Destructible scenarios\n+Refined Stealth\n+Good missions besides being only a few\n+Kiefer made a good work at voice-acting\n+Good shooting\n+Control support if you don’t like to play on keyboard and mouse\n+Snake on PC!\n+Great ending\n+Impressive AI\n+Idroid is very versatile and useful\n+Some cool easter eggs\n+Kojima himself in-game!\n\n\n-Short story\n-Little overpriced for those who pays only for story\n-Camp Omega is quite small\n-Lack of some features (Box, Knocking…)\n\n\n\nGround Zeroes, besides being small, is an amazing Epilogue for Peace Walker and a good Prologue for The Phantom Pain with all-new features and good PC port 8,5/10\n\nBuy the game if you are the kind of person who likes to explore and complete everything on a game, this game will give you a lot of diversion. If you only play for story, do not buy it, it’s excellent but it’s only gonna last for 1-2 hours. If you are a MGS fan, buy it, you’ll love it and play it a lot.\n\n\nUPDATE: There is a modding community going on for GZ! The mods are funny! They change the models so we can play as Kaz, Chico, and other characters!

This is not a demo!\nIn the eve of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, I'll be reviewing Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes because some people still don't seem to get it at this point (short version at the bottom of the review).\n\nFirst of all, I've played most of the MGS games before this and I love them to death, so my opinion may be a bit biased.\n\nMetal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is a prologue to Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, like way back when there was a pretty short and limited Gran Turismo 5 Prologue but was still sold as a full game. That's not the case with GZ.\n\nBear with me for a moment, this game focuses on giving you a glimpse of what The Phantom Pain will be. GZ puts you in control of Snake (aka Big Boss) in an infiltration mission, but gives you the freedom to explore the mission area and tackle objectives as you see fit. With collectibles spread throughout the map, it invites you to step in every corner, watch enemy movements and memorize them, listen to soldiers' conversations, hijack vehicles, all adding up to the experience and helping you reach your goal. This main story centrical Ground Zeroes mission, can take from anywhere between 15 minutes and 1 hour or more since there's no time limit, also depending if you go full stealth or guns blazing towards your objective.\n\nAfter you're done with the main mission, you unlock pseudo historical recreations of events prior to the Ground Zeroes mission in forms of Side Operations. These Side Ops have different targets and goals, from eliminating 2 targets in the entire military base, to destroying enemy turrets just before an airstrike. All of them take place in the same area as the Ground Zeroes mission, but you get a specific starting point for each one of them. Again, you're free to tackle your objectives however you see fit.\n\nThere are two more unlockable Side Ops which main feature is fan service. I could explain those two but why ruin the surprise? You can look online or in Steam for guides on how to unlock them anyway.\n\nIf you're a fan of the games and story, there are little nods to the past of the series. If you're new to the series, these collectibles and tapes will show you part of a great cohesive plot that has been developed over some great games, hopefully ending you with trying the rest of the MGS games.\n\nAll in all $20 isn't overpriced because the content is there. It is locked behind extras, but taking into mind how it's possible to put to sleep an entire army with a tranquilizer gun, then run over them with a tank, what you get is based on how and for how long you play. As of the moment of this review Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes comes bundled for free with each pre-order of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, so you get to experience this game just before the main course is released.\n\nShort version:\nGround Zeroes is a prologue game, not a demo\nShows you the core mechanics of the upcoming Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain\nAllows for replayability based on how you tackle objectives\nHas side missions with different objectives, with many ways to tackle them\nMany collectibles, some of them unlock more missions and story elements\nWhat you see in the game depends on how you play and for how long you play\nAs of the moment of this review, Ground Zeroes is free with each pre-order of The Phantom Pain\nThank you for your time, I hope this helps your decision of whether getting or not this game.

This may or may not offend your sensibilities, but in my opinion it's worth the cost if you're not on a tight budget and find it on sale\n\n\nPositives\n\n-Gorgeous graphics\n-Stable and well-ported\n-Tight and simple but not overly simplistic controls; feels very mechanically sound; takes some cues from games like Splinter Cell\n-No count-down timers or radar make for a more tense, fun, and challenging experience\n-Useable vehicles\n-Sandbox\n-Non-linear setup allows for a variety of playing styles (i.e., stealthy, run-and-gun, etc)\n\nAll-in-all I give this a recommend if you find it in the $10-15 price range or lower. Though short, there's a few other missions that open once you finish the prologue, and the gameplay is rich and complex enough that it has a decent amount of replayability, the graphics are great, the sound is great, and it's a lot of fun.\n\nIt makes my Metal Gear...

It only has one story mission unfortunately and it can be completed in just few hours. After that you have an option to do some side ops.\n\nGround Zeroes is great for rookies of the franchise to get familiar with the basic mechanics or for regular Fox Hounds to see some of the new additions in MGS V and put the story in motion for Phantom Pain.\n\nIf you already have or are planning to buy Phantom Pain soon, Ground Zeroes might not offer you much. If you want a taste of things to come, I can recommend buying this from a sale. Doing the sideops will give bit more longevity to the game. You can replay the missions to get better ranks or scavenge casette tapes that add to the story.\n\nThe Fox Engine looks and runs great on PC, if you want to test how your PC can handle the Phantom Pain, Ground Zeroes helps in that regard too since there is no free demo available.\n\nBecause of high quality and replayability of the missions, I think this game is more than just a paid demo. Everything from graphics, to voice acting and gameplay are stellar. But even with high production cost, the short length of story missions makes the game seem just a bit overpriced at full cost.\n\n[Score: 83]","October 6, 2015","true","4.4"," 48 of 55 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","48","55","0","4"

I have fond memories of the 1998 PS1 MGS and that is about it.\n\nI got this in a flash sale for about £3.50\n\nThe errr, game (I can't call it that; I'll just say 'mission') - can be rushed in about 15-20 minutes if you are running and gunning which is huge fun, but I was severly affronted when it ended... I actually said very loud and very clear; Really?\n\nHowever, the depth to the mission while stealthing is huge and is really where this shines. Lots of nice options when dealing with enemies like neutralising, disarming, KO'ing, killing, interrigating, stabbing, chatting to then putting to sleep etc. Lots of routes, lots of options to the objectives. A small mix of vehicles, a surprising selection of weapons and some pretty decent voice acting - Even got Kiefer Sutherland as Snake... although he must say about 8 words throughout the mission in total. Its a got a lot of good things going for it.\n\nThe mission WILL catch you out plenty if you want to ghost it... this isn't a 'KO/Kill everyone on the map' type of game - As the mission progresses things change and that option / route you thought you left open for later, probably won't be, you'll be forced out of your comfort zone and forced to think and improvise - which coming my worlds of Thief / Splinter Cell / Dishonored - Is refreshing.\n\nThere are some 'grown up' themes thrown in to the plot, at least one actually hard-to-watch cutscene and a completely non-sensical story....\n\nThe mission is not worth more than a fiver though.... with the main game, mission, being so astonishingly, unjustifiably unbelieveably short. This is a bit like the Hitman: Sniper Challenge - A precursor to a bigger and proper, fully fledged game (The Phantom Pain obvs) which I'm looking forward to eventually playing thanks to this.\n\nSaying all this there is plenty of re-play value, extra missions (rehashing the same 'map' / base used in different ways) and an absolute bucket load of easter eggs, secrets and fun to be had - So I'd recommend it to anyone into similar titles to Splinter Cell - but pick it up cheap... dead cheap.","December 22, 2015","true","25.2"," 37 of 39 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","37","39","2","7"

If the answers to previous questions were yes, im glad youre feeling lucky and u should get this game. The main mission on first try is about 2-3 hours of top notch stealth action quality gaming, with amazing cutscenes, bloody and dark themes  (seriously, this might not be a game for everyone), great voice acting and everything MGS has always been. With all the lighting effects, sharp textures and fluid animations sometimes it's hard to belive its not rendered CGI . With addtional side ops, easter eggs, ranking system, the replayability is quite high, no to mention story itself was designed in such a way that in order to fully grasp it u have to  do multiple playthroughs and search for cassetes. Add to that a high difficulty curve, with enemies on hard having better sight then most humans, amazing PC port (no crashes, fluid  60 fps on high/very high, only problem I had is display turning off randomly for few secs during gameplay) Not to mention getting highest ranks and learning the game mechanisms, the whole"getting gud" part, were  one of the most satisfaying experiences i had in gaming in years. If youre looking for a reason no to buy it - perhaps 20 euro for a engine demo is a bit steep, also the learning process is quite painful, with countless retries and "that wasn't my fault... okt maybe it was" moments. Other then that, if u love MGS and can't wait for TPP, GZ will drill a hole in your skull that will give u certain distate for every other game that isn't The Phantom Pain, and make every day without TPP seem boring and wasted.\nI warned you.","January 14, 2015","true","29.8"," 52 of 63 people (83%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","83","52","63","9","0"

The Phantom Pain\n\nLet's talk about the game a little\n\n-------------------------------\nGAMEPLAY\n-------------------------------\n\nYou play as Big Boss, one of the most elite soldiers during the cold war era, and as such he comes with his own unique skillset. Boss is a master of sneaking, and as such he is instructed to complete all his missions stealthily, and with no backup.\n\nEquipment is procured on site, and you have to rely on your own wits and good luck.  The controls are perfectly optimized for keyboard and mouse, although it is playable and quite enjoyable with a controller.\n\nThe enemy AI is amazing, enemies act according to the situation which is going on, and their eyesight is sharp, meaning you have to be really careful when sneaking around\n\n-----------------------\nSTORY\n-----------------------\nMetal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes is a prelude to Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. It begins with Big Boss infiltrating a black site in Cuba, or as Kaz would call it "A little slice of American pie on commie soil"\n\nThere, he is instructed to exfil two members of Big Boss' "Army Without Borders", Paz Ortega Andrade and Ricardo Valenciano Libre (also known as Chico). Paz was captured, and Chico went in after her because he loves her. I really cannot reveal much, you have to find out most of it for yourself.\n\n-----------------------------------\nOVERALL\n-----------------------------------\n\nA very good port, excellently optimized, and with a great story and gameplay. I believe this game is just a stepping stone for Metal Gear games to finally appear on PC, and we might actually witness this in the near future.\n\nGame is a 10/10, I would definitely recommend it.\n\nBravo Kojima, you did it again.","December 19, 2014","true","11.2"," 45 of 52 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","45","52","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tetramoose/recommended/311340/","tetramoose","Ebola Wizard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tetramoose/","188 products in account","Though I will reccomended this game from a gameplay standpoint, this review is a critical look at MGSV as a product. While I certainly enjoy the gameplay Ground Zeroes offers, there is no reason this game was not offered as a free demo as opposed to a paid product. There is only one story mission, and it will take you a little over an hour to complete. I always assumed the complaints about the games runtime were an exaggeration; but they are far from it. This is essentially a 15$ demo with some quick and cheap side content plastered on to make it feel like less of a rip off.\n\nThe major defense thrown up by most fans is that there is content outside the main mission, which is only somewhat true. The side missions, while fun, can hardly be considered "content." Each of the 6 side missions take place in the same map the main mission does, but with a different objective.  One has you destroy anti-air emplacements, another has you identify and assasinate two targets. In other words, there is nothing these missions have to offer that the main one doesn't. Ground Zeroes is essentially the same mission in the same place 6 times, each with slight differences.\n\nThese minor distractions are better than nothing, sure, but the design philosophy of Ground Zeroes seems to be in allowing players to complete the game in whatever way they please. No two playthroughs of the main mission are really the same; in my first attempt I snuck into the main base through a side entrance, but in another I hopped into the back of a truck and entered the Admin complex that way. Sometimes my plans follow through flawlessly, other times I find myself dodging enemy fire and desperately hoping the escape helicopter won't be gunned down.\n\nIt's this same non-linear design that makes the side missions feel spectacularly pointless. The side missions offer nothing that the main mission doesn't. They only really exist to create the illusion of meaningful content and to make the purchase feel more worthwhile when it really isn't. This problem is amplified by the fact that  some of the side missions completely fail to maintain the high level of freedom that the main mission offers. The perfect example of this is the mission where you have to destroy the Anti-Air emplacements so the base can be bombed. When the C4 is detonated, the alarm is sounded, forcing the base to be under alert. I attempted to get around thisby stealthily placing C4 on each of the turrets and then waiting until the evac helicopter arrived outside the base to detonate them. As it turns out, the player is still required to destroy the tank that spawns after the turrets are destroyed, so rather than flying away from the base and allowing me to complete the mission stealthily, the helicopter proceeded to fly aimlessly over the base and be shot at by the tank and the soldiers in the base.  For a game that seems to pride itself on how non-linear it is, I find these sorts of things to be highly unacceptable.\n\nThese complaints will probably seem quite nitpicky to someone who hasn't played the game, but given both the design of the game and the small amount of content it provides, the only way to get your money's worth is to play the game over and over again. And through repeat playings, it can become obvious how flawed Ground Zeroes is. The decision to sell and package Ground Zeroes as it's own game has only served to hurt it. If Ground Zeroes were released as a free demo without all the extra bells and whistles, the controversy behind this title would be non-existent. But instead it's made Metal Gear fans skeptical towards the future of the franchise, made consumers skeptical towards the future of the video game industry, and has given detractors of the series more ammunition.\n\nThe gaming industry is still young. There are many different ideas and philosophies as to what makes a game worth paying for and many publishers are attempting to push boundaries to see what they can get away with. Even if this game were merely a means of gathering money for the development of Phantom Pain, this practice still feels incredibly dishonest. In capitalism we vote with our money, and by buying games like Ground Zeroes and attempting to defend them as products we are telling publishers like Konami that we are okay with them selling tech demos for exorbitant prices. The fact that so many Metal Gear fans were hurt and upset by the runtime shows exactly how dishonest this practice is. When the game was released it was 40$, and when you buy a 40$ game, you expect a certain amount of content. Many of the people who paid that much for this game were tricked into thinking it would be something more, something worthy of having the legendary Metal Gear name on the box and something the developers deemed worthy of 40$, but instead what they got was a tech demo with a few collectibles and little more.\n\nI can only really reccomend this game if you are a hardcore fan of the series and want to support the development of The Phantom Pain.The story is great, the gameplay is great, the graphics and animations are great but the package it's presented in is not. I don't regret my purchase. I've played it for 9 hours now and intend to continue playing it, but it just seems so ridiculous to ask anyone to spend money on it, even if the current 15$ asking price isn't nearly as bad as it was. Wait for a drastic sale to pick this one up, unless you just want to support Kojima and encourage him to continue porting his games to PC -- which he has done an excellent job with thus far. I really want to love this game, and to some extent I do, but I still can't shake the feeling that I've been ripped off by whoever decided to sell the game this way.","January 25, 2015","false","15.5"," 233 of 353 people (66%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","66","233","353","13","1"

It certainly isn't worth full price, and recommended to be purchased during a Sale at around 75%.\n\nGround Zeroes is the Prologue to The Phantom Pain which is set 9 years after.

Fluid gameplay, perfect animations, smooth grapics, really good sound, relatively low system requirements. A lot of story is being told through cassette tapes - about 1 hour so you'd better get them all if you care about plot. Missions are easy enough to get A-B rank on first walkthrough and hard enough to spend 1-2 hours retrying 5 minute missions for S. Nothing stops you from choosing your own way of completing the mission, no more corridors - this adds a lot of replayabitily. Some content was cut from the final version (knocking on walls, bullet casings etc - whole list is on community forums), but it doesn't matter that much since it should be in The Phantom Pain. Get it if you are interested in stealth games with cinematographic experience (and also a perfectionist who can replay the same mission for 8 hours trying to  neutralize all enemies on the map without killing them. Without reflex. On hard.).","January 17, 2015","true","65.3"," 37 of 44 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","37","44","5","0"

I highly recommend you do. Esp if you like action/sneak games. It's graphic heavy so make sure you have a good computer for this game. but srsly play the previous games before even considering playing this one. It's a short teaser game but it's nice to have and get a feel for the controls when the real real game comes out.\n\nMetal gear solid is such a great series. I could talk about it forever I'm such a nerd for it. I've been playing it since it was first released on playstation one. and i've loved it even then in all it's pixel glory. Pretty cool seeing it available on steam even tho i have it for the ps4. The only thing that bugs me about this game is the fact that they changed voice actors for the main main character. It really broke my heart. Felt like i lost a friend. Hard to get into the new voice actor. Not sure why Hideo Kojima did that. but regardless it's still my favorite series.

If you like stealth-based gameplay you can't be wrong with that one.\n\nThe only main mission is short but if you like exploring and doing the side missions, or improving the way you play to achieve s-ranks, I assume it can last more than 20-30 hours, which is way more than some games sold at $40 or $50.\n\nThe scenario is good. Since the game is short there's not too much material to base my judgment on but it seems to efficiently link Peace Walker, which I recommend playing, to the upcoming The Phantom Pain.\n\nSound effects, voices and music are once again flawless as in every MGS game. I miss David Hayter's acting a lot but Kiefer Sutherland does a good job too.\n\nControls are logic and easy to learn, Big Boss' movements are slick and responsive. I still haven't figured how to dive/dash despite of the prompts but I'll eventually understand.\n\nAim assistance and "reflex mode" - which slows time when you're spotted - can be deactivated.\n\nThe Fox Engine is gorgeous and the game is amazingly well optimized. Note the fact that it's a developper that doesn't usually develop for PC, yet does a better job at it that a lot of other companies.\n\n\nIf you want to fully enjoy it I recommend playing the other Metal Gear games, or at least MGS3 : Snake Eater and MGS : Peace Walker.\n\nControls with a Xbox360 controller are comfortable and accurate so I recommend using one. Maybe aiming is better with a mouse but the rest just feels better with the controller.","December 19, 2014","true","24.9"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","29","32","0","0"

But what about those who never even touched an MGS game?\n\nFirst off, this main game is short. Your first run on the main mission should take anywhere between 90 minutes or 3 hours at most. If you play just the main story and that's it, you'll be dissapointed. But if you like to complete side missions and have OCD, I feel you'll get your moneys worth with collecting all those XOF patches/cassette tapes, getting higher ranks, and finding new ways to complete missions.\n\nAs the for the gameplay, it's MGS at it's finest. Switching from crouching to crawling has never felt smoother, and it's actually hard to go back to something like MGS4 after playing this. And gunplay is great, especially with the new bullet drop effects, which makes you rethink about sniping someone across the map. My only complaint would have to be the cover mechanics. They're... quite awful to be honest. Hope they fix this in The Phantom Pain. Also no cardboard box. WTF?\n\nThe AI is pretty good as well. If you stand in broad daylight, it's obvious they'll see you 20 meters away, even on normal. And if you think reflex mode makes this game too easy, you're very mistaken. Especially when you get spotted by 3 guards and all you just shot a single shot tranq. Also, don't rely on regen health. Take too much damage, and you'll have to manually heal yourself with the marijuana health spray from Resident Evil. Realistic? No. But neither is eating rations that magically heal you after a point blank rocket launcher blast.\n\ntl;dr version:\n\nPros are great replayability, lots of stuff to collect, gameplay, graphics, Hideo Kojima, and marijuana health spray.\n\nCons are short main mission, cover mechanics, no cardboard box, and too much water.\n\nOverall I'd recommend this those who like to do everything in the game, have OCD, and want a great stealth experience.\n\nDon't recommend if all you're here for is the main story. You'll feel ripped off. And hate water.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I'm off to attemp an S rank on the main mission. But killing the guards is so tempting after collecting all the tapes...","December 20, 2014","true","14.3"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","28","32","0","1"

Unless you're a hardcore MGS fan don't buy this you're essientally paying for a demo or even a quarter of the quarter of another quarter of the game you actually want. What I can say is that from the 1-2 hours of gameplay you get out of it, its an amazing experience and a lot of fun, and I personally cannot wait for the Phantom Pain. So I recommended this to people who love MGS or are interested in the franchise but don't pay anymore than $13-16 for it because its a demo its really not worth the extra dollars. However I don't recommended to the average consumser because there are plenty of games out there that are purchasable for $20 or less, that you'll get a lot more out of then this paid for demo. Like Splinter Cell Blacklist which I paid $9 for and got over 10 hours of gameplay, even Hitman Abosolution and the other Hitmans for under $5 when on sale and you'll get around 10 hours out of those too!\n\nTL;DR\nThis game is Short, and you'll get more out of cheaper games, don't buy unless hardcore MGS fan or have the money to waste.\n\nEdit: I added more Quarters.","December 31, 2014","false","9.9"," 441 of 743 people (59%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","59","441","743","22","36"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/311340/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Finally, another Metal Gear Solid comes to PC, this time back to its routes of being a stealthy tactical title which is a far cry from the type of game REVENGEANCE was.\n\nThe stealthy aspect of Ground Zeroes does everything right. It's something that the whole series does well, so it should be expected though. As I have only had the experience with MGS 1, 2, Snake Eater and Revengeance, the melee controls seem fluid and faultless. All in all, the combat system and stealth are amazing, and I wouldn't change anything about them.\n\nNow, I seem to be saying this every time I review a big AAA game, but these are some absolutely gorgeous graphics, whack all the settings up to full and you are looking at an actual piece of artwork. I couldn't believe how real the world looks in here. The character models, faces, everything, this game really shows off the power of PC gaming.\n\nGround Zeroes is the prologue for a future MGS title, Phantom Pane, although I understand Phantom Pane is going to be a much bigger title, I still felt a little miffed off that I was paying £16,99 for a game that only lasted two hours, and that's with doing the extra missions at the end. The actual main story can be completed in less than an hour if you know what you are doing....this to me was the only negative point from this release.\n\nI had no technical issues at all, it's quite surprising to see a developer who mainly makes games for consoles, push out such a well-made port. A nice, steady, 60 fps the whole time playing.\n\nThe final verdict on Ground Zeroes; I would recommend it, but maybe wait until it drops on sale so you don't feeling the same as I did with regards to the game's length. If it wasn't for that, I'd say this is a must buy and a great game to test your rigs on.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

So many memories of the franchise came back to me whilst playing this. Great to play as Snake in HD.. its been so long! The new fox engine is beautiful and it runs perfectly on max settings.\n\nGameplay is excellent, felt really smooth and controls are straight away simple to pickup. I am a strong believer in quality over quantity, this game being a pure demonstration as to why. Everything has been well thought out, the story mode admittedly not long but provided great entertainment. I wasn't particularly excited about the idea of playing through just a prologue, but after completing it and seeing the story set up it just makes me want the full game now!\n\nSide Ops and Extra Ops is a nice bonus, providing just that little bit more for us MGS lovers that wanted more before the final game is out. For people that have been worrying about the short storymode, check my hours for the game. Personally I feel it has great replayability and with more challenges and tasks to do you will be finding yourself eager to get stuck in and try to earn all the accomplishments - like me.\n\nOverall I am very impressed and am looking forward to the full game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/311340/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Metal Gear Solid is one of the most revered franchises in gaming, containing some of the deepest and complex stories to have ever been told. Following the iconic Sold Snake, the series has maintained a strong consistency of quality and diversity, bringing us to a variety of different beautiful locations and establishing some of the best stealth action mechanics available. While we are waiting for the release of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, Kojima Productions have yet to cease development on Ground Zeroes, bringing the short prologue to the dynamic PC platform.\nGround Zeroes is one large camp Big Boss needs to break into and rescue two captives from Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker: Chico and Paz. If the player goes into the campaign a little stealthily, while at the same time not avoiding killing anyone when need be, they can beat it in roughly an hour.\nThe Metal Gear Solid franchise is well known for their lengthy and incredibly detailed cinematics, and this is somewhat similar. The difference is that there’s only two major cutscenes, taking place at the beginning and end of the campaign, along with another two very brief moments mid-mission. Unfortunately, you’ll be stumped at what’s going on and who the characters are if this is the first time jumping into a Metal Gear game, but there is a rough breakdown through a slideshow available on the main menu.\nOutside of the short main campaign, there are a handful of side operations to partake in. These give players objectives to accomplish in the same open area that are completely optional, but do offer a decent amount of variety. The short main campaign will not last you long, unless there’s a strange desire to go back and speed run the mission, and while these aren’t particularly lengthy themselves, ranging from five to fifteen minutes, they are a nice change of pace. They also sometimes unlock plot related content through the cassette tapes, whether mission oriented or through Chico’s hidden set.\nGameplay is Ground Zeroes’ strong point as the leap from Metal Gear Solid 4 is noticeable. Kojima Productions have crafted a sizable open area to move across, with soldiers that populate it and go about their daily businesses. While it’s only one area and really only one type of grunt enemy, it’s the mechanics that really show off what a modern stealth action titles should be. The controls feel a lot looser than they once did, with more modern implementations such as sprinting, jumping into a prone position, regenerating health, and much more. Enemy behavior is very different this time around, having an on-screen notification pop-up when an enemy has caught a glimpse of Big Boss.The more time spent out in the open, the more likely they will come to investigate, contact HQ to inform them of a suspicious individual, or outright call for backup. This somewhat ties into the new Reflex feature that is entirely optional for purists out there. Instead of gunfire raining down on Big Boss when spotted, he will have an opportunity to not only automatically turn towards the enemy, but be able to fire on them while in slow-motion.\nUnfortunately, players did run into some hitches in the frame rate on AMD graphics cards, while Nvidia based units seem to run the game magnificently. This is a step up in the visual department, allowing for even more objects on screen and greater effects if your computer rig can handle it. Outside of the graphical options, the controls have also been decently implemented, as well. While it’s still preferred to use a controller for how many different commands there are, the keyboard and mouse controls still offer an adaptation worthy of praise, and allows for a little more precision when aiming.\nMetal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is a nice bite-sized piece of content that will help players get a good grasp on what to expect when The Phantom Pain is released.It retains the stealth features hardcore fans have come to enjoy, while at the same time implementing various modern mechanics that will appeal to an even greater audience. This also marks the first time Kiefer Sutherland replaces David Hayter as Big Boss, cementing the actor’s place in the series. While it may only take an hour or so to complete the main mission that acts as the prologue to the next game, the PC port of Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes not only lives up to expectations, but surpasses them in creating an overly satisfying sandbox to sneak through.\n","July 4, 2015","true","146.5"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","25","31","2","0"

BUT this game's story is barely nothing at all. The total amount of gameplay hours put in this is literally just 1 to maybe 5 hours?! If I wanted to I could rush the main story in less than 30 minutes, which is barely anything at all...\n\nThe moment this game came out, it was seriously overpriced.... which is way more than it is atm, but today it's still high priced for such a short game. This game isn't worth 20 bucks, actually its not even worth 10 bucks.

Impressive Graphics (nice rain and lighting effects)\n\n2. Impressive Gameplay and mechanic (The movement look , feel and sound right)\n\n3. Decent A.I (Found most times when setting off the alarm, soldiers will either charge towards my location or fall back and regroup forming a group of 4 or 3 soldiers to back each other up)\n\n4. Vehicles (riding the helicopter and driving any vehicle is awesome, especially the ability to knock soldiers out and take them for a ride)\n\n5. Short....like a demo (The game is more of a tech demo, it does give a bit of a story leading towards Phantom Pain but there is just not enough there to keep you busy. The few missions there are do offer a bit of fun and enjoyment but being played on the same map as the story it gets boring fast)\n\n6. Price (Buying it during the sale was great but I sometimes wish the game was priced $10 or should be included as a pre-order towards Phantom Pain, for it to be a standalone is just not strong and I find myself pacing back and forth wanting Phantom Pain to be released)\n\nOverall Ground Zeroes offer a good taste of what is to come for the Metal Gear series, showing a bit of the gameplay and features that will appear in phantom pain. However for new players just entering the series it may feel strange charging $20 for a tech demo as well as create a bit of confusing as who is who and what is going on as the story branches off Peace walker.\n\nIf your a diehard fan of Metal Gear I would recommend getting this and go around looking for all the cool little items and points of interests. If your just starting the series I would recommend picking up Peace walker for PSP or PS3/Xbox 360 to help establish a bit of the story or wait for the price to come down a bit to $10.

Not only for one hell of a superb port, a rarity from Japanese developers, but also for one hell of an awesome experience so far.\n\nGround Zeroes is short... Ground Zeroes is pricey...

The Game Mechanics, The A.I, The openess in how you approach your Mission objectives. It's all top notch, I don't know about others but whoever did the porting of this game did a damn good job if you ask me. This is after all how a Port should be done and the fact that this game is just a preview of what Phantom Pain will be - I am just speechless (No literally I can't speak anymore, need to go to a doctor).\n\nStory [8.5/10] - Now I wish I could have given 10 or at least a 9 here in this but that would be cheating, after all I am trying to give a genuine review of this game. This individual story is quite good, you have everything that you need to know provided in the back-story and casette tapes. The cutscene directions, the wonderful voice acting - all has been done near to perfection. However when you play this game for the first time (Like me) - All I knew about Metal Gear was Snake - I didn't knew who was who and all that stuff and honestly speaking - it's not quite easy to get hold of it either unless of course, you're a die hard fan which I wasn't - so what about us. Maybe someone else will provide you with a different solution but mine is simple, watch the video series (The Link I provided above - it will bring you up to speed on the entire MGS lore) and once again that video series if for people who don't know much about the MGS Story or they are confused in some parts. That will surely help them, it surely helped me - Now I know everything about MG ^_^ (Boo Yea).\n\nTotal Score [9.5/10] - This game for me is value for money, it provides hours and hours of gameplay - I am 12 hours in game and I still have to collect a few of the achievements that are left. So overall you get at least - 5 hours of gameplay if you're a player who likes to rush through things and over 20+ hours - if you're an achivement hunter and a completionist. This game sets a very good stage for what's in store for us - Phantom Pain (The name sends a shiver down my spine), that game will be epic. I don't know what others will do with this game but for me it surely will be one Hell of an Epic game, for me it will be one of the best games of 2015.\nDo I recommend it? - HELL YES, after all if I don't - Naked Snake aka Big Boss will come find me, which I don't want. *Psssst - I hear a helicopter, gosh I am too late in writing this review, Snake is here D:* *Runs around in circles and hides inside a box*","February 5, 2015","true","31.0"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","18","24","2","7"

The game runs surprisingly smooth and the graphic quality is very good. It would be better if you had a controller rather than mouse and keyboard as the hold up or interrogating system requires you to press the directional buttons on your keyboard whilst holding 2 buttons already.\nSnake’s voice actor, Kiefer Sutherland is kinda weird to adjust to. Sounds very, different. The snake is now an Alien. But I hope we get used to it.\nSpeaking of getting used to… The reflex mode. It will save you! A lot. Well for me. At least ahhaha. The reflex mode is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but then it removes points from you as it’s flaw. This is… understandable ahahha, for the demo at least.

But this isn't a $20 game, this feels more like a demo. The game takes place on a single, medium sized map with a short campaign mission. Once that's beat you can then replay that map doing different things, (Assassinations, intel collection, demolition). But really, it gets boring fast and feels way to shallow to call a game, escpecially a MGS game.\n\n\nI'm so used to MGS games being an in depth story with a huge possibility of ways to mess around with the enviroment and the enemy. All this did was make me feel stupid for buying it at full price.\n\nTL:DR: It's not a game, it's a $20 demo.","March 25, 2015","false","4.5"," 43 of 71 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","43","71","0","3"

Although it's awfully short, clocking in at only about 3 hours of gameplay, there is surely some replay value. How I replayed it was, the first time, I took down all the enemies lethally, the seconds playthrough, I did it non-lethally, which is slightly harder because they wake up at some point. The third time, I went in guns blazing. And no, this is not an excuse for me to forget about how short the game is. In fact, I have done this with Peacewalker and Snake Eater as well on the PS2. The mechanics and style feel very familiar which I like, the AI has been greatly improved, and this is the first MGS game to come out on pc, and I like that because keyboard is my preferred style. The graphics look top notch but not all the time. For example, the lighting got a little jittery reflecting to certain objects and the grass seemed like a ghost. Now here's the writing and directing. One word. Phenominal. I wasn't expecting it to be this great and it felt like I was watching a movie. Would I have expected this from an MGS game? Hell no, this was actually way too serious for a game like MGS because I always remember it being kind of silly sometimes and this was a little too serious. And when I mean serious, I mean mature audiences serious. I won't spoil it but you have been warned if you want to play this.\n\nThe voice acting is also very good but Chico might sound a little older than how he looks. The reason why you should play this game and the other ones from the series is because this is one of the smartest stealth games and you really have to use your strategy in this one. You probably have noticed all of the stupid AI stealth cliches right. Well, with MGS, you barely notice any of that. This game is also pretty challenging for beginners. There is no save progress button so be smart with your actions. Another great addition to this game is how you want to deal with the enemy. You can interrogate him into telling you where certain things are, kill him, or knock him out. I usually interrogate him first and then do other things. Would I recommend this game it you bought it when it isn't on sale? NO, this game is way too expensive at launch and now so don't buy it for a 3 to 4 hour campaign. If it's on sale you should buy it. I bought it from a third party site where it was around 8$. You should also check out the story of MGS before playing it because most new players might not even know even half of the things that are happening in this game and that can be a problem. This game had potential to be something greater but I feel like this was a little bit of a money grabber from Konami. Those are the two things I hate about the game, short campaign and the price. But I still recommend it though.","August 16, 2015","true","4.4"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

It's overall a really polished game and for the current price, you can't go wrong with it.\n\nI personally really miss David Hayter's voice for Snake.

So passing under their eyes this time will take so much more skill (and that's a good thing).\nSome people believe the game only features the main mission (Ground Zeroes), but there's so much more to the package!\nThe 6 side/extra missions (which take place in the same map, but different times of the day) are really well made and they offer a complexity and dynamism i really didn't expect.\nIt was a true joy playing them.\nSo in the end you get a very well made prologue with 7 missions that can easily take you something like 8 hours to complete with an s-rank, and that assuming you don't want to chase achievements (For that you'll need so many more hours), all for a very very small price (You can find this game online (legit keys) for 10 dollars).\nA brief note on the technical side; the port is amazing! It's greatly optimised and works flawlessly.\nThe graphics are perfect! A huge amount of detail and an amazing lighting system. the fox engine is a true beast.\nThis prologue really gives us a small teste of the masterpiece the phantom pain will be, and it's highly recommended to all MGS fans.\n\nPros:\n\n- Modern Stealth Gameplay\n- Fluid Character's Movements\n- Satisfying Difficulty (If played as a stealth purist)\n- Amazing "Sandbox-Style" map\n- Many different approaches to the same goals\n- Inspired side missions\n- Many easter eggs\n- Many Collectables/Hidden objectives\n- Greatly Optimised Port\n- AMAZING Graphics\n- Amazing presentation (As usual with Kojima)\n\nCons:\n\n- Only one (Even if very big and articulated) map\n- Needs too much patience to complete achievements (Some of which ask you to complete the same missions over and over and over again)\n- The game can be completed in a very short time, if played without chasing the ultimate stealth experience.\n- Makes the wait for the phantom Pain even harder than it used to be","January 7, 2015","true","28.2"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

A bit short, yes. It’s much darker than previous Metal Gear Solid titles. They kicked David Hayter as the cheesy but defining voice-actor for Snake in favor of Kiefer Sutherland from 24. It seems like Kojima goes through a transition phase personally and it shows in his games, namely this one and P.T., the excellent precursor for the new Silent Hill.\n\nGround Zeroes is just a taste of what’s to come in Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and perfectly sets the tone. It’s dark and perverse; the franchise has matured in a way. Personally, I’m really deeply invested in the story of Metal Gear and can’t wait until Big Boss’ tale comes full-circle, even if it’s going to be sinister.\n\nAlthough the Paz’ memos from Peace Walker are included in the game, don’t play Ground Zeroes if you haven’t finished Peace Walker yet – much of Ground Zeroes’ brilliance will be without effect if you don’t know what’s really happening.","June 16, 2015","true","2.1"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","17","24","0","0"

It goes to show that although PC gaming is thought as a small business investment in Japan, Konami really have gone all out to make this game shine on the Personal Computer. This “port” does not even seem to feel like it was created by a non-caring company that was only interested in your money; “Buy now, we fix it later”, but a well thought out, and developed game that has PC gamers in mind. Port: 10/10.\nThis game runs extremely well on many/any computer, despite it being on a small map, this comes as no surprise, BUT the model detail, and the amount of AI in your vicinity at once is still handled well on older computers. The AI itself is quite smart on the hard difficulty, although on normal they do feel fairly dumb.\nThe price can feel demanding for people that have heard there is only 20 minutes of content…Right,  many people have said this is not true, but as many others have also said, it can be “completed in 5 minutes”. Let me clarify, both sides are wrong. The Ground Zeroes mission, the main mission, CAN be speed ran in <10 minutes, whereas the entire game (for completionists), can range from 5+ hours. There is quite a fair amount on content in Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes and a lot of people seem to forget that.\nThe gameplay itself is very, very good. Although I, myself feel as if Kojima is keeping 99.9% of the gameplay mechanics (goodies) hidden well inside of The Phantom Pain’s unbeknownst release date. The way Big Boss moves, to the way combat is handled does not feel like a traditional Metal Gear Solid game. I am a long-time fan, and was at first sceptical about the way it looked from the trailers, it did not look “Metal Gear Solid” at all. Instead, it looked like DICE and Activision had teamed up and taken over development and decided; “we should make it appeal to all of the Battlefield and Call of Duty fans!” I could never have been more wrong. It DOES still feel like Metal Gear Solid, it just needs some getting used to. You have to remember the entire game itself is changing, the theme of the game has changed, the purpose of the game has changed. This is not Solid Snake. This is Big Boss. Playstation 2 players will remember how different Snake Eater felt compared to Metal Gear Solid, and Sons of Liberty. Big Boss is a different character, and has a different story. So what better to compliment his return to the game with new mechanics, a new engine, a new voice actor and a new tone of the series?\n\nOverview:\nPort: me, personally 10/10, but; 9/10 (Still heard some people are having loading problems)\nAI: 8/10 (Normal difficulty is far too easy. Hard feels more enthralling)\nGameplay: 10/10 (Refreshing. Fast paced, slow paced. Stealthy or loud. Your choice)\nContent: 8/10 (Not many missions, of course. But if you really want to 100% it, you 				may as well make a coffee and be ready for frustration)\nVoice Actors: 6/10 (I used to love the codec screens, and the voices that followed. No, I am not whining like most about Hayter being gone. Solid Snake is DONE. It was a mistake to make Big Boss’ voice actor Hayter in the first place. The guy is talented, as is Kiefer Sutherland, and I cannot fathom why the Japanese voice actor has been kept the same; but, Kiefer is the better choice. Why the 6, though? Because only select enemy soldiers have a voice actor. Most have the “Peace Walker subtitles” to serve as its way of giving you the information you got out of them. The only lines they have are notifying the command post of your presence, and shouting tactical orders, this is not fun, nor immersive…It just lacks any interest in what is going on. Plus, another negative is Skullface. His voice does not command leadership, nor does it sound “Villainous”, it just sounds plain.\nEnvironment: 5/10 (I could not come up with negatives nor positives for this, yes it is “open world” to a degree. If you count Camp Omega, and Camp Omega alone as open world. There is much to explore, and much to learn about where you can place yourself in certain situations, but the map still feels the same as the time before. I trust The Phantom Pain will rectify this, and deliver what I hope to be a 11/10 experience.\nThank you for looking! Please do enjoy the game. If you are looking for a reason to buy it, you should not have to. It is worth every penny, and the series itself deserves every player, and it does not cost much? If you are still sceptical, just take a look at some YouTube videos.","December 18, 2014","true","44.5"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","18","27","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/311340/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","I recommend this game, but VERY PRECARIOUSLY.\n\nI have no idea about the back story of any Metal Gear game. All I know is that Snake has been cloned numerous times and is somewhat considered a super soldier. I do know that Metal Gear is all about informing HQ what is going on, and depending on whether you get spotted or not, can differentiate the level of difficulty you face at any moment.\n\nThis game by far, has excellent stealth movements available concerning mobility (running, jumping... yes jumping, crouching, and even creeping low on the ground). You can jump over obstacles, and even climb on a few. What you cannot do though, as seen in the Splinter Cell series, is climb up on pipes or hang over opponents heads to attack them from above. The running, crouching or standing, is enjoyable and sprinting feels absolutely right with the camera shake. You can even run and then press X to jump straight onto the floor into a creep position. I wish more games had this ability, or the ability where CoD had where you can run, then hold jump, and go into a jump position ready to shoot. When it comes to stealth, it is near impossible to hide in the dark. Hiding from the enemies line of sight is the name of the game. If you are seen by an enemy, they will get curious. How long they have seen you for will determine if they decide to investigate. If you are seen, enemies will not be afraid to rush you and possibly flank you. The enemies are always in radio contact, so take out a guy at the wrong time, and someone may be alerted. In-game, there are also vehicles present (APC, Jeep, Anti-Air Guns, Trucks) that can be used to create catastrophe.\n\nThese are neat features as most stealth games do not let you use whatever is in your environment to your pleasing. The driving is not anywhere near Need for Speed, but adds a great depth and choice to the game. The shooting scheme is done nicely, and when an enemy spots you, time slows down for a few seconds allowing you to quickly fire off a shot and hope to quiet the situation down. Enemy bodies can also be hidden or thrown once they are taken down. When you grab an enemy, you have the option to interrogate them for intel (enemy whereabouts, vehicle whereabouts, significant map locations etc...), choke them out (and risk having them wake up), or can choose to kill them. Killing them leaves a pool a blood and can be spotted by another soldier.\n\nThe sounds are great in this game. The attention to detail is much appreciated. When moving a search light, if you move it all the way to one side it stops at a certain point. Once it stops, it makes a slamming noise indicating you've reached the limi✝ of rotation. Speed doesn't matter (unfortunately), but it still makes the sound! When you get caught, the classical high pitch sound plays. The music is enjoyable and suits the environment.\n\nOne problem: THERE IS ONLY ONE FREAKIN' LEVEL. What a great game, but limi✝ed only one level. There can be supplemental missions (such as rescuing prisoners) as the base is pretty big. It does not make up for the fact there is only one level. I feel besides this, a little more stealth could have been added to the game. I won't lie, I miss blending into the environment in a box. Would be nice if you could displace a crate as you moved.\n\nRATING : 7.2/10\n\n***The rating truly is at a 7.5-7.6 but since there is only one available level, this is what it gets as a complete game.\n\nFor future games : why not add in multiplayer or a local co-op feature? Multiplayer would be huge! The potentials are endless : PvP, PvComputers, or even cooperative missions with a few agents running around.\n\nScreenShots :\nThe three options you have when you grab an enemy\n\nI was in disbelief when I was allowed to drive this\n\nI was in utter disbelief when I had the option to drive this\n\nI wish every game had this ability","June 5, 2015","true","4.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

Not even high hopes, I've seen the gameplay for it, it's going to be epic.\n\nAnyway, review for Ground Zeroes. Storywise, it's an execellent prequel, and a necessary one. Not much else I can add, it's Metal Gear. Gameplay is exceptional, the new FOX engine is amazing, truly. The game offers a lot more than the main storyline though, side ops are available & hell of a lot of fun. And they're all full of easter eggs for fans of MGS.\n\nIf this is your first Metal Gear game, like mine, it's a good introduction. Timeline wise, you've only missed two games, which you will be filled in with the backstory option on the menu. Can't say much else, just grab it, not even that expensive. I also recommend you play MGS3! (And all the others, but mainly MGS3)\n\n\nSidenote: People calling this a demo.. I've gotten more than one hours gameplay from it, I'm currently at something like 16 hours. Anyone who only has an hour in it is stupid, I don't think it's even possible to rush every side-op and get an hours gameplay time.\n\nThis is a prequel, of course there is only one story mission. The price is reasonable for the game, a gamer can get their moneys worth from the game, an MGS fan probably even beyond that.","December 21, 2014","true","27.8"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","1"

The only game of the series that I have played is MGS4 way back on PS3 and I loved the entire playthrough but never got around to doing it again or buying another. Recently I was sold on MGS5 TPP and this (Ground Zeroes) happened to come with a pre-order of the game. While this does give you something to play and test before MGS5 TPP comes out, the variety seems to lack a little because of the 1 zone; I guess that's what you get from a "demo" of sorts. On the other hand, the playability is as much as your heart desires because I have loved playing the main and various side missions in different ways over and over.\n\nPros:\n+Amazing graphics\n+Good optimization (Running 60+ fps maxed out on GTX 970)\n+Great improved feel to the game\n+Playability before MGS5 TPP\n+A little bit of story to the series\n\nCons:\n+A few glitches; movement spazzed out randomly (not often)\n+Only 1 confined playable zone\n+Slightly repetitive\n+Some bad features that are going to be changed in MGS5 TPP\n\nNOTE\nI want to say that this game will be almost useless once MGS5 The Phantom Pain is released. The reason for this is that is basically because this is a confined zone with one ~50 minute main mission and a few side missions with spins off the original. Some would say it was a slightly "more playable demo" before the actual larger game comes out. The only time this would have been a good buy is with the pre-order bundle or if you really can't wait to play the new game. Just buy [Metal Gear Solid: The Phantom Pain] if it is out when you read this.","August 26, 2015","true","25.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rock1m1/recommended/311340/","rock1m1","Rock1m1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rock1m1/","149 products in account","After years of deception, Metal Gear Solid series finally uncloaks before us PC Gamers. But how does the game perform?\nMGS: GZ is designed to be more of a prequel to the true next installment of the series: Phantom Pain (don't worry, that game is also coming to PC). This particular game was made just to quench our thirsts and make the waiting a bit easier. More importantly, because of the dramatic shift the game takes the series by introducing open world and very open-ended gameplay, it was a way for fans of the past installments to familiarize with the new structure of the game.\n\nNow I've seen many people claim this to be a glorified paid demo---I completely disagree however. The game offers a lot of side content, replayability with different approach to justify your purchase.\n\nIf you decide to just breeze through the main mission without bothering anything else, it would take only about 2 hours to finish it. However, if you plan to investigate the entire camp, find intel, rescue POWs, gather collectibles and do some of the side missions, then it will take you around 10 hours at least. This sort of venturing out of your way and exploring is definitely new to the series, which fundamentally breaks the linear level design and objectives of the previous games and works remarkably well. The open world provides more tactical approaches in handling the missions:  provides more ways of infiltrating mission area and approaching objectives. However at the same time the open ended nature can work against you as enemies are more spread out, are generally a lot smarter and if they see you then you are in for a tough firefight --- In previous games, this often led to many players restarting to the last checkpoint as more than often once you were spotted, it was impossible to go hidden again and you would eventually die. This time, you have the flexibility to not engage in the firefight for long and quickly become a ghost again. Another important thing to note is that the enemy AI is very dynamic--- They don’t follow specific patrol patterns for long and if you ‘disrupt’ their patrol, they will react in unpredictable ways. So, less memorization and more reaction is the gameplay paradigm that is enforced into the design and I for one gladly welcome this change.\n\nSo how is the PC port? One word ---Solid (no pun intended). The game runs beautifully across a wide range of systems and looks pretty good as well. While there are odd low resolution textures and detail here and there, but I guess that is what happens when you make a cross console-generation game (also available on the PS3 and Xbox 360) but it hardly detracts from the overall visual experience. My only issue with the game’s graphics is the obsessive use of blur. At times I feel like the game uses blur in the wrong situations and not in the right amount. For example when you point the gun in first person, it for some reason blurs the crosshair. The game also have some problems finding the right intensity of the blur for the relative distance to the background. Also, the FXAA used is poorly implemented and it just looks like it blurs out a lot of textures in hopes of reducing jaggies. For consoles I understand as FXAA is cost efficient in GPU power, but for PC, please give us an option to turn it off and use some other form of AA that does not blur the image. Even if some other AA was not an option, I would gladly turn off the AA here and instead using DSR (down sampling) to render the game at a higher resolution and downsize it, which works better than any AA out there anyways.\n\nThe controls of the previous games in the series always felt like one of the weakest areas, simply put--- they weren’t designed to be effective when you needed urgency in your movements and combat. Thankfully, the controls of this game is very well designed. While many would understandably want to play this game using a controller, I decided to try it with the mouse and keyboard as it was a PC Gamer thing to do! After playing for a few minutes, I changed some of the controls to better suit my needs: Making the most of the extra buttons on my Logitech G502 mouse, I mapped many of the controls to my mouse as I feel I am much faster using the mouse buttons than many of the keyboard buttons. Again, this is down to the preference of the player which will vary from person to person. It was a bit odd to find out that the extra mouse buttons other than the right and left click not bindable. Another thing to note, the game does not alternative buttons for each command. Also oddly enough, the menu navigation cannot be done with the mouse, instead the keyboard WASD is used and 1 and 3 to change the menu options which I find it weird. These rough edges shows Konami’s inexperience with PC game design but they can be easily solved in a future update.\n\nSo that pretty much covers it. This is a small, yet delicious, slice of game that I have been waiting anxiously for. Like every delicious slice, it just makes you want more!","December 20, 2014","true","27.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","4"

In a lot of ways it bares more resemblance to open world action games than it does any of the previous Metal Gear games.\n\nThe game takes place before the original Metal Gear and follows Big Boss on a rescue mission. The story isn't much to write home about given it's essentially the introduction to the Phantom Pain. Not a lot of the story is introduced to you, and it eventually ends on a rather unsatisfying cliffhanger. It is also unfortunately just a single mission with a few additional side ops that give you additional objectives while there.\n\nFundamentally the biggest problem with Ground Zeroes is not it's length but it's pacing. It ends just when you expect it to really get good and it leads into a cliffhanger and then a trailer for the next game. This caused a huge amount of drama when the game first released. It also feels very unlike previous Metal Gear games. David Hayter doesn't voice Snake, there are no codec calls and there's no fourth wall breaking humor. A lot of these problems carry over into The Phantom Pain so you should be aware of that if you buy these games separately.\n\nThe gameplay is all good though and it really blurs the line between action and stealth game. With hundreds of different ways to approach a single stealth mission. But it's not worth getting on it's own and the only reason to buy it is as a teaser while you're downloading The Phantom Pain.","February 5","true","4.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

However I believe what is on offer is very good if slight. The game contains a two hour story prequel mission with your typical MGS production that tasks you with rescuing 2 targets from a sandbox style prison camp. There are other things to do in the camp such as find collectables which unlock a set of bonus mission etc. After you finish the main campaign there are something called side ops, which change the time of day and give you different objectives to complete inside the same prison. Their are also a lot of lore filling audio logs regarding the characters in the game. Visually the game looks great, running at almost 3 times the visual fidelity of the next gen console version on max settings, and is easily one of the best optimised; If not the best, games of the year.\n\nI would say if your a Metal Gear fan this is easily worth the asking price simply for the production values and being able to play in the stealth sandbox, others may want to wait for a sale before grabbing it.\nMy opinion is it's a great taster of what is to come and well worth playing.","December 26, 2014","true","16.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

MGS team did a really great job with it.\n\nPlayed through the whole main mission with mouse & keyboard, it was pretty awesome. Controls were smooth and nothing awkward. I think they thought it out pretty well.\n\nGraphicsBeautiful, absolutely beautiful. Fox Engine might be my new favorite. lol\n\nEven when it's set to low, it's still stunning. The way it can scale and all the stuff, amazing.\n\nAudioFantastic. Every little detail, from rain hitting the surface to far off distant yawn. Well done.\n\nOther StuffAt the time of posting/playing this. My PC's specs are:\nAMD Phenom II x4 955 @ 3.2Ghz\n4GB of RAM\nAMD/ATi 6770\n\nAfter tweaking some graphic settings, it'll run very smooth. I did lock FPS at 30, I did this to prevent any unexpecting issues. So, if you're wondering if your PC can run it and you have similar specs. Here's your answer. :)\n\nThere is plenty of replay too. Stuff like Side Ops and Extra Ops. Or maybe you're a trial record setter or an achievement hunter. There is still tons of stuff you can do.\n\nIf the quality of this is the same for The Phantom Pain, then that will be fantastic aswell.\n\n-stamps paper- Recommended.","December 23, 2014","true","12.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","2"

So I was wondering what would The Phantom Pain be like, but I didn't want to buy it considering my previous experience with MGS series. That's where Ground Zeroes comes in - especially for the sweet price it is now (it's about $2.5 for me). So I've spent a few hours trying out GZ and I've liked it. The gameplay is so much more polished than before, story is great and it's twists are unpredictable. Now I clearly know that I'll be buying The Phantom Pain when it goes on a good sale.\n\nSo the moral of this story is: if you want to know if you'd like The Phantom Pain or not - try Ground Zeroes first. But be sure to buy it on sale.","May 27","true","3.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

There's no doubt that most people will feel shunned at the fact that this is a prologue to the main game "The Phantom Pain", but I think it's well worth the money.\n\nYou get a large map with various missions, trials, collectibles and hidden extras that MGS fans have come to love. There's also some very nice cutscenes to introduce you to some of the characters that will feature in the main game. Even if you aren't an MGS fan this game is a very nice introduction to the series and allows you to really understand the mechanics of the games. I've completed all 6 missions after 7 hours but I'm only 43% complete.\n\nThe graphics are incredible and the performance is incredible (it's very well optimised).

My parents never bought me a console so I never had a chance to play any of the earlier games and this is the first time I've played as Snake(disregarding the times I went to my friends house to play Super Smash Bros as Snake).\n\nThat said, I can see why this game, this series, is so popular. The story is amazing and was so captivating that I felt disappointed when I saw the ending credits scroll by. It was gruesome, it was heartbreaking, it was intriguing; but on top of all that the gameplay was smooth as butter. I seriously can't wait for The Phantom Pain to come out now.\n\nOn another level though, I feel conflicted about this game. The plot only lasts for 1 hour and the price-to-hours of fun feels disproportionate in this regard but then again, everything I said above. Ultimately I'm recommending this game if you can get it on sale.","June 22, 2015","true","1.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","6"

I do not regret buying this game at all, in fact it is probably my favourite game this year, I own my fair share of games on steam, over 200, yet it is very rare that one of these games will be played for more than 2 - 3 hours, what i'm trying to say is that i have definitely spent more money on less gameplay, if you are sure that this is the kind of game you enjoy, BUY IT NOW, it is well worth it, i'm not even half way through all the content, if you dislike stealth games, i would proceed with caution, there isn't much story here, though for sale price i'd say its worth the leap of faith as it's controls are stellar, especially compared to previous metal gears, the controls are fluid, the graphics are incredible, the port is nearly perfect, yet the content will last you anywhere between 5 minutes to 50 hours. In conclusion i'd give this game an 8.5/10 objectively speaking, but personally i'd go as far as a 9.5, this is exactly what i wanted and i knew what i was getting walking in, which is a short yet solid stealth game with tons of replayability.\ntl;dr\nMETAL GEAR FANS - NO BRAINER\nSTEALTH FANS - GREAT\nNON STEALTH FANS - KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO\nI RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE","December 19, 2014","true","14.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

But if you are a Metal Gear Solid fan I urge you to buy this game.\n\nThe game looks incredible on PC, at 1440p maxed it ran as smooth as butter with not one technical issue. The gameplay is fantastic, it's so much slicker and easier to control, but it hasn't lost the Metal Gear Solid feel. The main thing this game has done has fired The Phantom Pain up my anticipation list to somewhere near the top. Here is a list of pros and cons:\n\nPROS:\n- Superb gameplay, just like the other MGS games it feels like another level to other games of the time\n- Looks amazing and is technically near flawless\n- Lot's of unlocks, despite its length (side missions, weapons, etc)\n\nCONS:\n- Too short, even at a reduced price it's a bit much to ask\n- It will make you desperate for The Phamtom Pain to release, you will want more!\n\nI'm off to play through it again on hard. If the price an legth isn't something you'll get hung up on, get this game.\n","December 18, 2014","true","2.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The "Story" may be short and end in a huge cliff hanger but if you are a fan of the series this is seriously a no brainer.\nThe mission is simple, find Chico and Paz and get them to extraction. However we all know this is a MGS game so there is always a catch ;). The trial missions are fun and challenging (Do you have what it takes to S rank?). The AI is some of the series best, and while this is the first time Kojima brought snake "Open World" it feels natural. This is how he intended it. This allows new and old fans to become accustomed to the new tride and true CQC styles, get familiar with the dynamic AI, and best of all teaches us how to take on missions one at a time in MGSV The Phantom Pain when it releases. I mean lets be honest here, if Kojima were to just throw us in a huge open world in TPP without training us first, ALOT of people would have felt misplaced and uncomfortable. We are used to fixed routes and blindspots and tricks and most of them wouldnt have worked in this new amazing system. So why are you still reading this? Just go buy it now while its on sale and make up your own mind.. How do you want to complete this mission? By slicing everyones neck? Slow and stealthy? Take your chances blowing ♥♥♥♥ up cus its fun? Or giving everyone and there mommas a shakedown on info... So many routes, so many ways to complete the objective. (Hint: you dont need to extract people in helicopters ;) )\n\nEnjoy this teaser of whats to come and practice practice practice.

This is because this “game” is a vertical slice of the main title with some extra missions to pad out gameplay.\n\nEven so, this "demo" might be one of the best stealth (action-adventure) games out there with tight gameplay and near perfect presentation, its only downside it’s how short it is.

It includes a recap of Big Boss's story up until now, although as always a release-order playthrough of the Metal Gear series is recommended for a more complete knowledge of this game's sprawling and convoluted back-story. A large portion of the story of Ground Zeroes is told through collectible cassette tapes, along with pre-mission info and the logs of a certain spy. That said, Hideo Kojima's signature cinematic cutscenes make a return and they are better than ever before.\n\nWhile Ground Zeroes may serve as an entry-point for many people into the Metal Gear games, especially for the PC crowd, I can't help but feel that Ground Zeroes is intended more for the long-time followers of the Metal Gear series. It is, after all an extremely short game, featuring one location that includes one story mission along with four Side Ops and two hidden Extra Ops. To shell out any amount of money for a game this short really requires some commitment to the series, considering The Phantom Pain is set to be about two hundred times larger, along with an online component and a base-building metagame. Fans of the series however, are sure to find many hours of entertainment contained in this small game - finding optimal routes, toying with the guards... endlessly replaying the single story mission in an attempt to sate the craving for that sweet sweet Phantom Pain goodness.\n\n+ Open-ended gameplay where you get to decide how to tackle your objectives. High replay value with the ability to freely sneak around the game's limited open-world.\n+ Some of the smoothest-feeling controls in a third-person game. Big Boss's movement is fluid and responsive, and mouse-aim is a very welcome addition.\n+ The Fox Engine is unleashed from the chains of inferior console hardware to provide the premier visual experience of Ground Zeroes. The PC version features an extended view-distance, more dynamic lights, increased shadow resolution, screen space local reflections, improved ambient-occlusion, 4K resolution support and a bokeh depth of field filter that kicks the game's industry-leading cinematic sequences up to 11.\n+ The game's minimum and recommended system requirements are exaggerated. Ground Zeroes will run on much older hardware and can easily maintain 60fps at 1080p on a medium-range computer.\n+ Plenty of collectibles and challenges for completionists to take on.\n\n- Very short game. More play time may be found in the Side Ops and Extra Ops, and through replaying missions.\n- Lack of audio options and mouse-cursor support in menus.\n\nFinal verdict: 9/10 "Pretty good..."","June 9, 2015","true","92.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

MGS:GZ may be only a couple hours long, and if you know where to go and are good at this then the game "can" be completed in as little as a few minutes (my current best is ~50 minutes). STILL, however, the game has so many ways to complete it, there are extra side ops to do afterwards (taking place at different times of day/weather), hidden goodies, etc that it really is a great game. I guess how much you get out of it depends on how much you like stealth games (I love'em), but the production values, the fine details, the price of entry--this game is worth it. Totally got my money's worth.\n\nAnd oh yeah: great job porting this thing as the graphics are great for the power required. Longer draw distance (almost no pop-in at all at max), better shadows & lighting and higher resolutions for the PC master race of course. Very unexpected from a franchise that has a long history of pandering to consoles.","December 29, 2014","true","76.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Phantom Pain might be, but Ground Zeroes is not.\n\nThis is coming from somebody whose absolute favorite game is Metal Gear Solid, and while I would normally recommend it to anybody even slightly interested in stealth-action or sci-fi games, I wouldn't recommend they start with GZ. Why?\n\nWwwell, Ground Zeroes is essentially a tech demo and a prologue to Metal Gear Solid V as a whole. It was released because Konami wanted to put something out alongside the release of the PS4 and Xbone, but Phantom Pain wasn't going to be ready at the time, so Hideo Kojima decided to put out what he had ready so far. That was Ground Zeroes.\n\nThe main mission, the story, is about an hour long if you take your time. Outside of that, there's a few side missions you can do which, while they're pretty unique from one another (and pretty fun, too), are mostly just there for the sake of padding. There really isn't a lot here in terms of content. It's a game that will only give you as much entertainment as the time you're willing to put into it. For people who aren't already fans of MGS, that probably isn't going to be a lot, and it's going to give them a lackluster first impression of the series.\n\nThat's one reason.\n\nThe other, which is definitely pretty biased on my part, is that the plot simply takes place at a point in the overarching story that I don't feel is really accessible to people who don't already know what's going on. It's like an interquel, almost, in that it centers around a very important character at a very important point in the grand timeline somewhere between the rest of the MGS games. If you have little to no understanding of what has happened in past games, though, you're either going to feel very lost, not very invested, or both. You're missing out on a LOT.\n\nBottom line, if you're interested in Metal Gear Solid, find a way to start with the older games! I recommend release order. Join me in praying that one day we'll see some PC releases of those games.\n\nIf you are a fan of MGS already, however, and you haven't played this on console yet, you should! The complaint that it's really short is still very legitimate even for a fan, but as long as you understand what you're going to be getting out of it (which many people who had that complaint didn't), I think it's a very, very solid prologue and a really promising look at what's to come with Phantom Pain. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is tight and refreshing, all kinds of stuff. It is a reeaally fun game. There are a lot of other reviews that'll tell you the same things and in better detail, I'm sure.\n\nThat being said, I understand if you find it difficult to justify a $20 pricetag for a game you will mooost likely get around five hours of playtime out of. If you're not dying to play another, brand new MGS game like I was, wait around for Phantom Pain. Buy both at the same time. It'll feel just like the Tanker mission (like I'm sure it was supposed to in the first place).","December 18, 2014","true","35.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/redzy/recommended/311340/","redzy","Redzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/redzy/","159 products in account","Looking at the minimum requirements, you'd think this game will never run fine on anything but the top PC gear. However, the good news is that it turns out not to be the case. Mine is a reliable but old setup: AMD HD6950 2GB GPU, with an Intel i5-3570K OC'd to a safe 4.2GHz and 8GB DDR3 RAM.\n\nThe game looks gorgeous and still runs at a smooth 60FPS on 1080p, with most settings on Extra High, except for the various Filters and Shadows, which I left on High, as they seemed to cause occasional drops. Not a big problem, but if you have a better and newer GPU than mine, I believe you won't encounter the slightest issue at this resolution, as the stress definitely isn't on the CPU.\n\nSpeaking of another aspect of the port, the mouse+keyboard controls are—for the most part—done really well. If you can get past having to use exclusively your keyboard on the various menu screens, I'd say the controls are pretty intuitive once you have spent a few minutes on them. I also must say I've never expected to enjoy playing a MGS game using anything other than a gamepad, but I've been proven wrong.\n\nThe other advantage of having this game on PC seems to be given by the versatility and overall quality of the Fox Engine, which people have taken very little time to exploit in forms of texture and/or model replacements that yield results such as being able to play as Chico or Kaz against soldiers resembling Big Boss, or something as absurd as replacing the crows' model for a human one, which looks as funny as it sounds. Before long, we may have fully fledged mods that add up to the game or even become games of their own, one baby step at a time.\n\nAs for the game itself, it has one main mission which will take you anything from 20 minutes to 2 hours to complete, depending on your approach and expertise. Its function is to set the stage for the upcoming Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, and it's the only mission with relevance to the plot. Of course, there are side and extra missions which will keep you busy for a few more hours if gameplay is what you're mainly looking for.\n\nI would recommend this technically very good port to any long-standing fan of the Metal Gear Solid franchise who doesn't mind a bit of redundancy in terms of overall setting on the way of some nice fan service extras. I can't particularly recommend it to newcomers, as it doesn't really give the best of ideas of what the franchise is about, and it might be a tad confusing for someone who hasn't followed the storyline.\n\nTo those, I would definitely recommend looking back to the older titles, most of which (excluding the rather important original Metal Gear Solid, in fact) can be found in the HD collection for PS3, PSVita and Xbox 360, if you have a console. Special mention goes to Metal Gear Solid 3 (originally released on PS2), which is a masterfully crafted installment that narrates the story of how Big Boss came to be.\n\nA final aspect I would reflect upon is whether the current price tag is worth it for the average consumer. If you have slight doubts, I'd in fact hold off and wait for a sale, as the upcoming title will definitely steal the show and provide much more valuable content than this.","December 19, 2014","true","27.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

(Gameplaywise for sure at least)\n\nDefinitely pick this up because its more MGS, new and improved. It's also a really nice port. I'm no expert but I didn't run into a single problem. You're going to be rather lost if you never played Peace Walker though (Which is the only mainline MGS that I found really boring and gave up on halfway through) but the game does give you some recap. Overall Ground Zeroes is real fun and I'm really looking forward to Phantom Pain.\n\n*Revision*\nAfter playing some side ops its really apparent that its way too hard to stealth in those modes, mainly because said side missions take place in broad daylight while the main mission does not. I really hope they fix this in Phantom Pain by giving you the cardboard box or something because its way too hard to remain undetected otherwise.","December 18, 2014","true","7.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kirzan/recommended/311340/","kirzan","Kirzan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kirzan/","604 products in account","TL;DR: Runs amazingly well, and reportedly so on way older PCs too. Their minimum specs are a safety net. Look up the forums. Raw mouse input. None of that annoying smoothing you have to disable in game files. Speaking of which, more than enough video options in-game. The many controls available aren't awkward at all on KB and Mouse. I can't comment on controller functionality, though.\n\n"Oh look, another console PORT!!!!"\n\nNope, nuh-uh, you could not be more wrong, my friend! Kojima proves himself to be way up there, again, by caring about this project. I buy a lot of games. I don't have the best PC: FX8350 (OC'd to 4) - R9 270X - 8GB RAM and an SSD. Most games that have come out recently either had ridiculous fluctuating FPS, endless micro-stutter, and needed to be run on PC Gamer Life Support (Beta GPU drivers, file editing, bs life support software). These are the "AAA" games we're getting now. Basic, 100% PORTS. This?\n\nIt defaulted to high on my rig. 1080, VSYNC on, high high high, borderless windowed. I have barely seen it dip in FPS, from 60. It runs smooth "LIKE BUTTAH". "Oh, but ports always come with that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mouse smoothing thing..." NOPE! Again! Raw input, baby! I'm telling you: This "port", runs better than any AAA game you've purchased recently, and probably looks a lot better too.\n\nAs far as controls go, I'm also extremely satisfied. You know, when it comes to games developed for a stick, you usually get awkward "robot movements" because it's just 8 directions, with WASD. Character animations take care of making it look fluid.\n\nFor content: Look at all the posts about people spouting out the running gag "paid demo hurrrr hurrrr" crap. You CAN get a lot of hours if you're into doing side-missions which are different enough to satisfy you, if you're looking for more. If this is a "demo"? Then it's the best god damn demo you'll ever play!\n\nEDIT: Oh, you'll have to control menus with WASD, ESC and Space. If you aren't a Master Race diva and can deal with this, then that's really the only con I can think of.","December 18, 2014","true","2.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Is it a prologue? Is it a demo? Is there enough there to warrant a purchase? Well, this question has three different answers depending on what type of person you are:\n\n1) Are you a Metal Gear fan? If so, then this game is immediately worth a purchase. There isn't a lot of story in there, but it's all worth experiencing for yourself.\n\n2) Are you only interested in MGSV, even though you've never played all of the previous Metal Gear games? Well, you should'nt worry then, because Ground Zeroes is a completely gameplay-driven experience after the initial 2 or so hours it'll take you to complete the main story mission.\n\n3) Are you only interested in the main mission? If so, then this game is only worth it if you are okay with spending the money on a 2 hours worth of gameplay.\n\nWith that out of the way, it's worth mentioning that Ground Zeroes is a surprisingly fantastic PC port. The game always looked pretty on consoles, but the hardware-limitations kept it from reaching it's true height. Now, with sharper textures, much better draw-distance, AA, and shadows, and with the addition of depth-of-field, the game looks so much better.\n\nOverall, if you're interested in this game, but not sure if it'll be worth it, then I'd recommend you get it anyways. What little story is there is of the highest quality, and the missions themselves are highly replayable.\n\nWelcome back to the PC market, Kojima!","December 18, 2014","true","18.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

(Whilst Kojima also has released Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance on Steam, which I also recommend for purchase, that title isn't technically a Metal Gear Solid game in the sense of name, howver is part of the same general universe)\n\nAnyway so Ground Zeroes follows Big Boss, a Militaires Sans Frontières operative trying to infiltrate an American base in Cuba in attempt to rescue two individuals, Paz, a Cipher agent, and Chico, a former Sandinista child soldier. The base, known as Camp Omega, acts as the primary focus of the game and an American blacksite, meaning that the individuals inside, prisoner and soldier, are not bound by any American laws that would regularly be granted to people on American soil, as a result of the base's secret and obscure nature. A result of this black site status, torture and other inhuman atrocties that would regularly be restricted have been committed in the base, urging the rescue of these individuals even more. The game follows Boss trying to rescue Paz and Chico, using any means necessary.\n\nYeah, so the trouble is, that's the game, it's short and has a reputation for being such, it after all being the prologue for the upcoming Phantom Pain game due for release later this year. This release serving as a result of Hideo Kojima wanting players to have a peek into Phantom Pain before it's finished. The game is rather quick and the base game mode can be completed really quickly, and there is only one map in the game, the Camp Omega map.\n\nHowever, don't let the game's length discourage you from buying this, it's a fantastic title, and the single best PC Port I've ever seen, the game running on highest performance being easily able to look better than the console addition, run better than the console addition, and play better, too. The game comes with many game modes to play, many weapons to use, and many tactics, strategies, and ways to play. The game has such a level of stuff to do after completing the base "Ground Zeroes" mission that I'm still hardly any ways from "finishing" the game, the game comes with an appropriate atmosphere, a great soundtrack that can be either mysterious, emotional, or action-packed, and a control scheme that is easy to grasp and comprehend, regardless if you're using a keyboard or a controller.\n\nThe gameplay is very open, and there is no path forced for the player to go down, wanna put C-4 o the road and blast a truck into the sky just for fun? You can do that, wanna kill everything in your path to get to Paz and Chico? Sure, wanna call for the support helecopter but end up destryoing it for sport? It's possible, the game is very open ended but makes sure to maintain a sense of forwardness too, with hints being widely common in the game in order for newer players to get a grasp on the concepts the game introduces, along with what to do in time of confusion.\n\nThe only technical problems I've come up with are that sometimes I encounter a glitch that will force a certain set of keys' commands to go off continously unless you hold down the key that's being glitchy, but it's a single bug and it shouldn't serve in any way as a deterrent from this title.\n\nRating this game out of ten I give a solid 9.8/10, whilst it's short and has some minor technical issues, it's a great title and a great port, even if it's only a prologue.","June 30, 2015","true","65.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Yes, you can play the main mission in two hours and call it wraps and be done, but it does have replayability and collectibles as you would expect from an open-world game. There are 8 missions in the game, most of the 7 "side-ops" being shorter than the main mission, "Ground Zeroes".\nThe game in itself is an amazing port and runs well on my pc (60 most of the time, dropped as low as 45 in the middle of the base in a gunfight), it has a small open world, but varying the weather in the missions and having guard attire differ is a nice touch.\nPros Gameplay, either stealth or open combat is fun.\nThe small story that is contained in the game is worthwhile to Metal Gear Solid fans.\nConfirmed crossovers into the main entry,  The Phantom Pain\nGraphics are good, scale well to lowest setting.\nVery well optimised for a console port.\nCons The story will not be as worthwhile to those who have not played Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker.\nThe in-game hud is not optimised for a Mouse and Keyboard layout.\nSome development decisions change the formula of Metal Gear such as the bullet time-esque "Reflex Mode" althoug this is understandable due to the new open-world setting\nThe open-world is small.\nMost of the cons will likely be outweighed by personal preferance. For me, although the world is small, that allows me to master the patrol routes and learn the geography easier, allowing for S-Ranks easier in future runs.\n\n","January 27, 2015","true","62.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Been playing since MGS1, never missed a game - always played each at least three times.\n\nSo, when this came out and everyone comlained at the length, I didn't mind so much. The game itself is bloody great, yes the map is one small location, and there's one main mission and a few side missions. But there are so many ways you can approach each one, it gets tactical, stealthy, actiony, and great fun. Not to mention how mechanically sound it is and how beautiful it looks.\n\nIf you are new to the Metal Gear series, it may seem a little daunting as the story given is fairly minimal - but just playing this you can understand the story of this game and how it preludes MGSV The Phantom Pain - just, not it's standing in the wider lore which can be explained and discussed for days.\n\nOverall, yeah, bloody great.","March 2, 2015","true","16.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Everything you make Big Boss do feels right and natural.  The big level allows for tons of player freedom to explore the base and approach a mission in different ways.  It's a blast to play.\n\nI'd fault it on its story.  It's very graphic and dark, and sets up the story very well for the next game, The Phantom Pain, but it's not very accessible to someone who's never played MGS.  Also they could have handled the sexual violence more tastefully than they did.  It was by no means bad, but it could have been done better.

If you're like me and wish to 100% the game like you should on any Metal Gear game then this will easily drag out 20 hours out of you at the least and feel like mere minutes as they say  ''Time flies when you're having fun''\n\nSHAKING THE FORMULA\nI've played roughly 16 hours as of writing this review and I'm only 35% through the game and as a long time Metal Gear player, this game feels much more.. difficult (if you turn off Reflex Mode as soldiers no longer can manually radio in to alert HQ of your sighting) and has it's fair share of upgrades and downgrades.\nThe game feels much more organic and some things you'll do in this game will make you just think ''Wow, look how far we've come'', the gameplay itself can envoke feelings such as feelings of guilt, remorse and you'll be determined to do some actions and willing to ruin the run you're on by maybe murdering some of the soldiers on the base to carry out your actions.\n\nFOX ENGINE: IMPROVEMENTS AT A PRICE\nThe game is much more detailed than Metal Gear Solid 3 or 4 visually, but the problems in this game having a new engine merely is that there's clipping, a lot of it. In prior games after MGS1, soldiers, if knocked out near a wall where they'd usually clip would put their feet along the wall but in Ground Zeroes, their feet will rather clip. This could be an issue in the Fox Engine or maybe Ground Zeroes was rushed in the 2 years and 3 months since the reveal trailer back in September 2012.\n\nThe game is very well optimised for a Metal Gear game on PC, if you've been following the series and played the PC port of MGS2, you would know how abbysmal that port was, requiring a gamepad or else the game is basically unplayable and all the issues in it. The keyboard and mouse controls feel well done enough, could have some improvements but all in all, is quite well done for Kojima Productions (or the porting team, not sure who did it) and leaves me quite optimistic for the future of Metal Gear returning back to PC.\n\nIS THIS A GOOD STARTING POINT FOR A NEW PLAYER?\nDear god no, if you're one of those PC only players and this is your first Metal Gear, go rent/buy a PS3, buy Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection (it's got all the Metal Gear games except Ac!d, Ac!d 2, Portable Ops and Metal Gear Rising Revengeance)\n\nAnd play Chronologically so you can play like all the other fans who had expectations and such and how their expectations were blown away or shocked.\n\nHOW LONG IS THE MAIN STORY?\nFrom my first time playing on Normal, rescuing everyone bar one hidden prisoner, and getting caught about 5 times, 79 minutes.\nMy replay where I killed noone, rescued everyone bar one hidden prisoner and getting caught once, 69 minutes.\nIt's all how you play, remember, I'm only using the time the game gave me, and I'm not sure if that counts the cutscenes.\n\nVERDICT\nI'm very biased for this and this is one of my top ten releases of the year 2014, I can't give a proper rating as it'd be quite unfair.\n\nI had a lot of fun even though some stuff were downgraded, but for $20/€20, it's really if you know you're gonna play it alot and not just one playthrough then never play again as for that price point, one playthrough is like throwing your money away.\n\nHow the ♥♥♥♥ am I meant to put my own music to play when the Helicopter flies to me?

(I think the minimum requirements aren't very accurate?) And it still looked way better than the PS3 version I played previously, so I'm definitely gonna be getting Phantom Pain for PC.\n\nThe optional missions that you unlock after the main mission will extend its playtime quite a bit, you can clock more than 10 hours easily if you want to unlock everything.","December 18, 2014","true","13.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","2"

You can interrogate guards to get Intel from them sadly its not a big help anymore like in the other ones, you can beat them up with CQC or sneak past guards to get to you objective obiously, but if we talking about combat (if you got detected) the game does well since you will still have full control of snake and dont feel like a tank so you can also fight back\nThe AI is pretty decent: they can surround you, only go to the position where you last went, search the area, reacts if you make noises and and and. in short its good but also has it lacking moments\nAlso the iconic cardbox isnt in Ground Zeros (but in Phantom Pain)\n\nPort i expected a decent port with it problems at first but i got surprised how well it runned on my maschine, i had 50-60 stable frames and it run on high settings and only RAM problems but they got fixed a rather good made port i would say , also they added the 2 secret mission from the ps version and the xbox version (Déjà Vu and Jamais Vu)\n\nConclusion\nPostive     Well and Fluid Gameplay\nA Good port\nNice graphics\nReplayable\nGood Stealth\nCheap for us PC user\nMostly Bug Free\nNice Setting (Fictive Guantanamo Bay)...\nNegative     The Lacking for Lovely Detail like in the past games\nA Rather Short Quicky prolog\nHelicopter wont disembark sometimes\nAI spots you sometimes unexplainably\nTo less Side missions\n...which also gets boring quick\nThe Game is Good but its just the prolog of MGS: V\nI also miss like i said the love to the detail thing\nBut hey at least its cheap if you are veteran you probaply got something to nag about but you probaply will still enjoy it\nyes i would recommend it for few Dollars or whatever you gonna use to pay\ni wouldnt if it was 60 $ but its not\n\nedit: i played more hours but offline add around 3-5 hours","February 26, 2015","true","6.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","2"

I don't think so. Paying less than $10 would be fair considering the amount of content it brings. Most people will say the campaing is short, and it is, but the game offers more content after the main mission is completed. Easily you can get around 6 hours of total gameplay, a little more if you are not that good in these kind of games that require patience.\n\nLeaving that behind, the game looks outstanding on budget based computers, I enjoyed it with 8 GB of RAM, ATI Radeon 5870 and a Core 2 Quad Q8400 at a stable framerate, the cutscenes are all real time like I would expect from a Kojima directed metal gear game, no pre-rendered crap like MG: Rising. The gameplay is fluid and intuitive, the music is outstanding and the enemy AI is pretty descent.\n\nThe story continues right after the events of Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, if you are new to the series, everything won't make much sense, there are some tapes and texts in the game that try to explain the events in the past games since MGS3: Snake Eater, but I would recommend playing or atleast watching a few videos about the story of Big Boss and his crew.\n\nI still don't understand why this was not included in the main game, just like in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, where you play the first part (prologue) with Snake and then you play the real game with Raiden. But still, it's a nice addition to the PC library of games, and a must have if you are a Metal Gear fan like myself.\n\nEnjoy!","December 20, 2014","true","36.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

First I'll address the port, and then I'll cover whether or not you should buy this game. I'll update the review if anything comes up to change my opinion of the port.\n\nFirst, my pertinent specs: GTX 770 2GB, i5 4690k stock speed, 8gb RAM.\n\nThe port is excellent. Having made the jump from last gen console to PC, the difference in quality is enormous. I was able to max out the settings at 1080p with my modest rig with no problems. Mouse and keyboard settings are definitely serviceable. I haven't needed to rebind anything so far. My biggest complaints are the pop-in with some objects like crates and foliage, and enemies disappearing when too many are gathered in one place, or if you leave the vicinity. These issues were also present on console, but can be overlooked with the increase in draw distance and texture quality in my opinion. Finally, the menus can only be navigated with the keyboard/controller.\n\nAs for whether or not you should buy this game, I can't recommend this game to every Metal Gear fan. If you're just interested in the continuation of the story, I suggest finding a story playthrough to watch online. However, Ground Zeroes is a sandbox that has a lot to offer if you're interested in learning the new MGSV mechanics, getting a taste for the capabilities of the Fox Engine, or taking apart the hints and details surrounding the game's new antagonist, Skullface. If you enjoyed the game on console and are looking for an upgrade in graphical fidelity, this game is probably worth picking up for you.\n\n","December 18, 2014","true","32.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game's freedom lends to its replayability, fans of games like Deus Ex or Dishonored will see themselves replaying to try different styles and earn a higher score. If you don't fall into that category, then expect 2 1/2 hours of solid gameplay.\nGameplay wise, it's a stealth/action game, similar to Splinter Cell, with a score system that punishes you for playing the actiony side. You suffer no in-game consequences for playing it like a shooter other than it being tough as nails to deal with the amount of enemies they send at you. I can't really speak of how it compares to previous titles in the series, because I've never spent a substantial amount of time with one. The map is very open, I'd say it comes closer to the scale of the original Deus Ex than any game since, which for some will be a recommendation in and of itself.\nControls are tight, I played on keyboard and mouse, ran into few issues with it, aside from movement while prone, which is clearly deisgned with a analog sick in mind. I'd probably recommend a gamepad, unless you're allergic to them, as I am.\nPort stuff: About a million options for graphics, gameplay and controls. The game is optimized like a dream; running with a 4690k, 8Gb of RAM and a GTX 770 4Gb, I never saw the game drop below 60 on Extra High(because an Ultra setting is for squares) other than when it first loaded into the game. It's exceptional looking compared to the console version, although I would like to have seen use of PhysX or something on flags and the windbreakers guards are wearing, it looks a little funky compared to the rest of the game. No mouse control in menus for no apparent reason, probably the only real black mark through.\nOverall I guess the game serves its purpose, because I am very excited for The Phantom Pain.","December 18, 2014","true","16.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Kojima Studios has worked some serious magic with this title. There is some pop-in with objects in the distance, but not enough to distract from the gameplay. Texture work is good, and the animations are fluid.\n\nGAMEPLAY: This is the meat of the game, right here. People criticize Ground Zeroes for being very short--a "paid demo" is the popular taunt against it. Honestly, the main mission can be completed in as few as ten minutes if you skip cutscenes and play with wild abandon. But that's up to you! How you approach a mission is very free-form. The Side Ops add another couple hours to the game. Most of the fun here is in finding new ways to satisfy goals. In one mission, for example, I walked through the level detonating anti-air defenses with C4. On the second play-through, I just stole a rocket launcher from a guard and took out all three in under a minute.\n\nOf course, this being a Metal Gear Solid title, you have the option to go through each level without killing anybody (mostly); you'll be rewarded for non-lethal playthroughs with new gadgets at your start point. The fun is in finding new ways to satisfy mission objectives.\n\nSTORY: Ha ha ha. Let's not even go there. You're Big Boss, invading a Cuban/American black site for I-don't-even-know-why, and doing lots of sneaky badassery along the way. It's Metal Gear. Don't think about the story, just enjoy the excuses it provides for you to do lots of interesting things.\n\nMUSIC/SOUND: Harry Gregson-Williams has consistently produced great tracks for Metal Gear Solid throughout the years, and his score here is just as good as his previous work. Use of licensed music, such as "Here's to You" is done skillfully. Sound design is great, all the character voices are cleanly rendered, the acting is mostly good (some overacting, but hey, it suits the story), and the audio for weapons and vehicles is accurate. Probably the one thing I have to say is that it's strange to play Big Boss and NOT hear David Hayter's voice come out!\n\nOVERALL: The main criticism leveled at this game has been its brevity. If you rush, you can beat it all in about three hours. If you take your time and enjoy the sandbox for what it is, you can play it for many hours more. This is a preamble for The Phantom Pain; I think we can safely say it's going to be good.\n\nI'm glad to have Big Boss on PC. He certainly kept us waiting long enough.","December 21, 2014","true","41.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Its not a bad demo, in fact its very solid if a bit overpriced as it is a 20$ demo without a sale. Its a single level that you beat once and unlock more sub missions to beat in that same level. I had heard that David Hayter had moved on to other things and was open to our new snake. Honestly, it was a bit distracting and I didn't think it would be.\n\nIf you go in expecting a full game or david hayter you will be disapointed. If however you play and see how well MGS works on this platform you will be pleasently impressed. New features like the spotting system are very solid and the combat is what I would expect from a super soldier. The graphics are rock solid as well and has a good frame rate on a midrange system. At times the AI is a bit stupid, I was able to take out 8 soldiers as they stupidly rushed the same choke point and ran into my waiting fist. This would not normally bother me but it would seem that kojima is trying to reinvent his brainchiled. So like any new game we need to be brutal.\n\nI think it could have been better myself, polish the AI, don't charge folks for a demo and if you are going to replace a voice actor, do not change to one that sounds 100% diferent then the one used a few years ago, people will probably notice, I know I did.","December 21, 2014","true","2.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Ground Zeroes may be short, but it does not disappoint. The story is emotional and full of twists. If you rush through the story mode, you could probably get it done in an hour and a half.  Don't be fooled because the map is massive and there are enemies everywhere. One could easily spends hours messing around.\n\nI'm pleasantly surprised by the new features in Ground Zeroes. You can run with unconscious enemies on your back and it makes the game feel much more fast paced compared to slowly dragging enemies in previous Metal Gears. And the health is now regenerative!

The game's freedom lends to its replayability, fans of games like Deus Ex or Dishonored will see themselves replaying to try different styles and earn a higher score. If you don't fall into that category, then expect 2 1/2 hours of solid gameplay.\nGameplay wise, it's a stealth/action game, similar to Splinter Cell, with a score system that punishes you for playing the actiony side. You suffer no in-game consequences for playing it like a shooter other than it being tough as nails to deal with the amount of enemies they send at you. I can't really speak of how it compares to previous titles in the series, because I've never spent a substantial amount of time with one. The map is very open, I'd say it comes closer to the scale of the original Deus Ex than any game since, which for some will be a recommendation in and of itself.\nControls are tight, I played on keyboard and mouse, ran into few issues with it, aside from movement while prone, which is clearly deisgned with a analog sick in mind. I'd probably recommend a gamepad, unless you're allergic to them, as I am.\nPort stuff: About a million options for graphics, gameplay and controls. The game is optimized like a dream; running with a 4690k, 8Gb of RAM and a GTX 770 4Gb, I never saw the game drop below 60 on Extra High(because an Ultra setting is for squares) other than when it first loaded into the game. It's exceptional looking compared to the console version, although I would like to have seen use of PhysX or something on flags and the windbreakers guards are wearing, it looks a little funky compared to the rest of the game. No mouse control in menus for no apparent reason, probably the only real black mark through.\nOverall I guess the game serves its purpose, because I am very excited for The Phantom Pain.","December 18, 2014","true","16.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

First I'll address the port, and then I'll cover whether or not you should buy this game. I'll update the review if anything comes up to change my opinion of the port.\n\nFirst, my pertinent specs: GTX 770 2GB, i5 4690k stock speed, 8gb RAM.\n\nThe port is excellent. Having made the jump from last gen console to PC, the difference in quality is enormous. I was able to max out the settings at 1080p with my modest rig with no problems. Mouse and keyboard settings are definitely serviceable. I haven't needed to rebind anything so far. My biggest complaints are the pop-in with some objects like crates and foliage, and enemies disappearing when too many are gathered in one place, or if you leave the vicinity. These issues were also present on console, but can be overlooked with the increase in draw distance and texture quality in my opinion. Finally, the menus can only be navigated with the keyboard/controller.\n\nAs for whether or not you should buy this game, I can't recommend this game to every Metal Gear fan. If you're just interested in the continuation of the story, I suggest finding a story playthrough to watch online. However, Ground Zeroes is a sandbox that has a lot to offer if you're interested in learning the new MGSV mechanics, getting a taste for the capabilities of the Fox Engine, or taking apart the hints and details surrounding the game's new antagonist, Skullface. If you enjoyed the game on console and are looking for an upgrade in graphical fidelity, this game is probably worth picking up for you.\n\n","December 18, 2014","true","32.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It looks and runs great (I really need to stress how solid this port job is) , it's easy to control with both gamepad and KB/M, and what's most important is that it provides a the player with a solid stealth experience.\n\nIf you don't plan on buying The Phantom Pain, then it's going to be hard to sell you on this game since it's essentially a prequel (the final cutscene is literally a pre-rendered trailer), yet if you're not sure if you want to drop $60 on TPP, then you should consider testing out the game with Ground Zeroes.\n\nHell, everyone should buy this game just to prove that there's a market for Japanese games on PC!\n\nEdit:♥♥♥♥ Konami","December 18, 2014","true","14.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I got spotted right away and didn't even know how to shoot yet because I was still fumbling with the controls, but I managed to figure it out, killed the first few guards and then sat in an anti-aircraft gun and fired at everything in sight. I restarted, and did a lot better as I managed to sneak up on the first guard tower, and knock out the guard. I picked him up, hoping to hide him somewhere out of sight, but still fumbling my way through figuring out the controls I chucked him out of the tower, he seemed to wake up mid-fall and scream before hitting the ground with a thud. I laughed my ♥♥♥ off, it seems I accidentally killed him. I took his body back to the starting area and tossed it into the sea. I was still giggling to myself after doing this.\n\nSo I decided to grab the next guard I could find, knock him unconcious and see what would happen if I threw him into the sea while he was still alive. He screamed and then there was a splash and I laughed way, way harder than the first time. I proceeded to knock out or tranquilize the next few guards and carry them back to the start where I threw them into the sea, still laughing as I did it. If you fancy a fun playthrough, try my unofficial "Get in the sea" achievement!\n\nMGSV: Ground Zeroes is a game that is little more than a demo, but the tight level design lends itself to getting familliar with your surroundings very fast, and with a few extra missions outside of the main story mission, there's a lot of fun to be had, and a lot of different ways you can complete your missions. When you have to take out 2 targets, why not throw them in the sea?

It looks amazing, too, definitely some of the best graphics I've seen from a console port. As for the game itself, the main mission is pretty short, but there are a few more missions to do afterwards. The gameplay is amazing, by far the best in the series.

"Oh, there's only one mission pertaining to the story of Metal Gear Solid? It's no better than a demo and it's $20 dollars. Hell no, man." Well, You are wrong, my friend. This is game, does only contain one main mission pertaining to the story but multiple side ops and bonus ops. I'm very glad I bought this on PC since I have both Bonus Ops since each of them were console exclusives, I believe (they were later patched in so both consoles had both bonus mission.

"Oh, there's only one mission pertaining to the story of Metal Gear Solid? It's no better than a demo and it's $20 dollars. Hell no, man." Well, You are wrong, my friend. This is game, does only contain one main mission pertaining to the story but multiple side ops and bonus ops. I'm very glad I bought this on PC since I have both Bonus Ops since each of them were console exclusives, I believe (they were later patched in so both consoles had both bonus mission.

In my opinion, this is the best console ported game in recent years! (AC Unity, anyone?) Now this is a game that deserves to be called Premium Quality!\nFor those of you who are looking into buying this game, do it. Your saved games will also be carried over to Phantom Pain which is its sequel and the main game of MGS V.\nAnd to the MGS team especially to Mr. Kojima, you did a great job here!

This is probably the first time we've had an MGS game perfectly ported to PC. The actual campaign is only 90 minutes of gameplay. Be warned. It's short. Beyond that, unless you REALLY like wondering around aimlessly, there's not much more to the game. The alternate missions just aren't very fun at all, and they all take place on the same map, but in different day cycles. I have zero interest in collecting objects or meeting arbitrary goals. I only really play this for the story and there's not much here. This is simply a great prologue to MGS5.","January 4, 2015","true","4.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Any suggestion is greatly welcomed.\n\nNow, let's start.\n\nAltough i rated this game as recommended,  beware that not everyone will be happy about this game and with valid reasons which i'll explain in the end of this review.\n\nFirst, i'll start about the graphics, animations and sound effects. They are nothing short of amazing, just like you could expect from any metal gear game. What impressed me more was the animations, which felt really realistic for a game. Plus you'll see great water effects on clothes, walls and even on floor, reflecting light pretty well and on floor it even reflects nearby enviroment, which is something i havent see it yet on any game (i may have noticed in some but this is really the first time i saw it). And the sound effects and voice acting are pretty good too. Don't listen to those bashing Kiefer Sutherland, who acted as snake. He did a pretty good job voicing. You may prefer David hayter as a original voice actor, of course. But you can't deny the good job by kiefer sutherland as well. So, you see, the technical part of this game is pretty solid. REally, this is may be the best port i have ever seen on pc. I can run it on ultra with 1620 p resolution with a steady 60 fps. And on 3820 x 2000 p with a steady 35. (Using a gtx 980). Nothing short of amazing, didnt have a single noticeable fps drop while playing this game. Only bad thing is the depth of field. There's no separated option to turn it off. If you disable it, in the screen processing settings, you'll disable AA and water reflection. I'm really waiting for a patch or mod that allows me to remove the annoying dof.\n\nSecond, the gameplay, i really enjoyed it and Kojima once again made a pretty immersive stealth game. If you are a newcomer, the game is mainly about you do your missions avoiding being seeing. You'll get better ratings and awards if you don't kill anyone and don't get caught. But you are still free to engage combat and in this game you have more ways than before to spread chaos, since you can even drive armored vehicle and use them to shoot enemies, but beware that you'll never make S ranking that way and you cant take much damage or you'll die. This is a great thing imo. It offers for both stealth and combat players and this game delivers nice quality for each of them without decaying in quality. Really liked how sometimes the AI act more varied than before, like sometimes changing patterns of patrolling. What i liked it most was when i was doing a mission where i had to deal with two targets. Each one were in different areas already pinpointed in your map. if you take some time to reach them, they may start moving to other areas of the map, thus making you having to either search them (in my case, one just showed up near me, while i was far from his area, which scared the hell out of me because almost trigered an alert.). Another good stuff is how you can threat your enemies when you hold them and they can give crucial informations about your objectives or point areas with weapons or useful stuff for you. It feeks awesome to get these.  Still, i miss how you could knock walls to atract enemies . I guess it may be removed to be more realistic, like you couldn possibly make knocks sounds and the enemy go to investigate and then claim it was his imagination.  But nevertheless, the controls may get some time to get used to but once they do, you'll start playing pretty smoothly (i used 360 controller, cant say about K + M). To end this, you have more than just one mission to this game, which gives replayability value, since you can beat them in different ways. Just like peace walker, but more open world and free. I really enjoyed this and i think this is something that every MGS fan will as well. But an annoying thing is that kaz doesnt't stop talking and repeating basics and stuff. I wish i there was a way to at least make him talk less\n\n3, the story. Well, you cant expect much about the story. Is just one mission just after the events of peace walker. If you havent play it, don't worry, the game will provided the previous story for people to understand it. But the the small bit it was showed in the game about the story is pretty good and immersive. If you are a newcomer to the series, beware that this game is known to have pretty long cutscenes. So expect one in the beggining of the mission and other in the end. A thing worth noticing about the story is that kojima is trying to make this game kinda polemic. What i mean is: expect some pretty cruel torture torture here. Just like war, which is what kojima is trying to show how bad and cruel it is. And in a bit of the game, he succeed very well in doing it. Just warning it to some players who may not like very gruesome stuff. It is not a con imo. But i understand why some people may be unconfortable, specially when that's the objective of kojima.\n\nFinally, i really liked this game, bought it while it was on sale and at least i felt it was worth. I really liked this game and i played more than my play time sugests ( iwas having problems with internet). Does that mean i can recommend this game to everyone? Unfortunately, no. here comes the thing that annoyed most people: the game indeed doesnt offer much content. You only get one map to do all your missions. A somewhat big map, sure. But just one. And the enemies will be in similar positions in every missions. If you played peace walker, you'll understand this. You'll have side missions in the same area of story missions. And this is the case, all you do will be in the same map. If you are not ok with this, i can completly understand and i can say that this game isn't for you, unless you get it on a sale or with price drop. Just notice that is not as bad as some people say like "wow, a demo". This game offers more than a demo but still doesnt offer enough for some people for it's price. So do THINK ABOUT THIS IF YOU PLAN ON PURCHASING THIS GAME! But i can say that i already cant wait for the full game.","January 4, 2015","true","19.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This is probably the first time we've had an MGS game perfectly ported to PC. The actual campaign is only 90 minutes of gameplay. Be warned. It's short. Beyond that, unless you REALLY like wondering around aimlessly, there's not much more to the game. The alternate missions just aren't very fun at all, and they all take place on the same map, but in different day cycles. I have zero interest in collecting objects or meeting arbitrary goals.

For the first time ever the stealth genre has hit steam with a quality port that never ceases too impress. After playing over 25 hours on my PS3 I can safely say this is a pretty big improvement. Majorly increased Draw Distance and a multiplied number of light sources this game is great to stare at alone. Game play is another thing, after almost 16 years of 3D Metal Gear Solid I love how they continue to shake things up with new gameplay mechanics and now it is shifting into an open world map. Ground Zeroes feels fresher than ever. The story is not long in length but there are so many different option of infiltration that if you are creative enough it will keep you coming back for over 20 hours. For (at the time) 11 or so dollars is well worth it as it builds off of Peace Walker and gets you ready for The Phantom Pain.\n\nPersonal Score: 8.7/10","December 25, 2014","true","18.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If you don't care about remaining quiet and run to the mission points, less than 30 minutes. The fact that there are a few vehicles in the island and even a turret means you can realistically just run and gun through the damn place and finish it in, perhaps, 20 minutes or less.\n\nSure, when you first enter the island it seems pretty big as you walk around, but when you finish it and the excitement wears off you realize how small it is.\n\nThis isn't about being a full-fledged 'episode' in the MGSV title anyway, it's more of a taste of what's to come. It's kinda like the Tanker episode in MGS2 and the first operation before the Boss' betrayal in MGS3. But even shorter than those. Rather than make us wait for MGSV Konami released that prologue as it's own title, at a bargain price (at least on PC).\n\nPC version runs smooth as butter, looks somewhere between 'next-gen' and 'late last-gen' (obviously). It's comparable to night-time in Sleeping Dogs, only with slightly better textures and effects.\n\nIf you're a MGS fan you'll probably do the collectibles in the map. There are 7 or so tapes to be found, XOF Tags that need searching, and some side-missions that have you using the turret and rescuing people on the island. I'm not complaining, it's MGSV on a small 'trial-island' before the actual game gets released.\n\nGet it on sale, don't pay more than 10 dollars unless you're a huge MGS fan.

Ground Zeroes is an absolutely superb stealth game, quite obviously the work of a brilliant designer and the result of all that has gone before it in the series.  Obviously the key comparison is with Splinter Cell, but whereas I liked Blacklist a lot, GROUND ZEROES is an open world stealth game, which means there is none of the heavy scripting and funneling that dominate the SC series.  In this game, you can make choices, like which LZ to use for helicopter exfil and which routes to take to any objective.  The controls, even on a PC port, are really well harmonised for KB/M and both the stealth and the combat dynamics are superb.  Great ambience, design and production values too.  It can be very unforgiving, as the AI feels very human and very sharp and, unlike in Splinter Cell, the game wants you to feel like one operative up against an army rather than an all-conquering specops ninja with a dozen gadgets; in this game you have your wits, an assault rifle with a silencer that will degrade through over use, a tranq gun and anything you can find.  Not only is it a superb game, it is a fine example of the art of game design and a slap in the face to Ubi and other corporate game publishers who dumb down tactical games in order to make the player feel like a bada$$.  For those who fear interminable cut-scenes, there are only a few and they are skippable.  It's not for everyone, as you need patience both to play the game and understand the remarkably convoluted story but highly recommended.","December 19, 2014","true","23.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Under the direction of Kazuhira Miller and Huey, Militaires Sans Frontières turn their attention to an upcoming inspection by the UN amid suspicions that they possess a nuclear weapon, which MSF believe to be an attempt by the Cipher organization to stifle them. Their preparations are interrupted when MSF agents in Cuba investigate reports that Paz survived and has been detained at Camp Omega. The situation is complicated when Ricardo "Chico" Valenciano Libre attempts to rescue her and is similarly captured. Believing that both of them could compromise MSF, Snake is sent to infiltrate Camp Omega and extract them if they are alive, or confirm that they are dead and if so, determine what they revealed to their captors. Snake also recognizes the value in rescuing Paz, as he believes doing so will convince Cipher to stand down while Paz will be more willing to discuss Cipher's activities with MSF.\nEverything in this story is mature and handles it maturely nothing is out of place or put there merely for "shock value" if you have knowledge of "Peace Walker" on psp or simply listen to the audio codecs you'll know it happens for a reason. HIdeo is a master at clever writing with "double agents", malignant organizations, and controversial topics to move the game industry forward as a whole into a work of art.\nThe character conversations are deeply engrossing and I slightly teared when Big Boss first finds Chico. This game solidly earns it's M+ rating and wouldn't recommend it to anyone under the age of 17 as there are depictions of extreme violence, torture, and gore.\n\nGameplay: The threat detection system is revamped, with the removal of the onscreen meter or gauge to indicate the player that they are in the 'alert/evasion/caution' state as in previous games, which have instead been replaced by visual and audio representations. Snake's binoculars have also been revamped; instead of selecting the binoculars as an item, the binoculars are hot keyed to a button. The player is able to mark enemies and be aware of their locations in the iDroid's holographic display. There are directional cues to help players when an enemy sees them from a distance and gets closer to them. A new "Reflex Mode" is activated when an enemy finds Snake and the player only has a short window of time (in slow motion) to take out the enemy before he fully sounds the alarm (a hissing audio cue can be heard if the player is detected by searchlight). Lights can be shot out to further aid the player's stealth efforts.\nThats some of the new things that can be found in this latest iteration of the franchise, next up comes cqc and takedowns which for anyone who has played a mgs game in the past, more specifically "Metal Gear Solid 3" should be familiar with, although here it's expanded upon with guards being much more dynamic depending on the situation ahd the level of freedom to not being constrained to any one point in the base. Once you grab a guard in a chokehold there are a number of things you can do such as make them yell out for assistance to the nearest guard to take both of them out in one fell swoop, or perhaps interrogate him for information on locations with more weaponry? The number of ways to take on an obstacle deeply varied depending on your playstyle. Of course all the previously mentioned things such as "reflex mode" and third person shooting can be turned off for purists wanting the ultimate challenge.\n\nSound: The design, soundstage, voice-acting, original score, all work harmoniously this is top notch quality at work here the production value is through the roof for this game and they really have invested big into it to bring this game to life. From ambient sound such as the rain pitter patting down to the ground and changing when going indoors to a "clunk" on the metal roof. Or the plop of a boot walking through mud, it all puts you there in the moment for you to enjoy and completley immerse yourself into the experience.\n\nGuns sound top-notch more than likely recorded in a professional studio first hand; every bullet being fired off packs a punch into your ears and shells falling to the ground give off a distinctive sound, reloading a magazine sounds authentic snapping into place just right.\n\nNow I know many of you have been complaining about the new voice actor Mr.Sutherland, while he may not be the original Snake voice we all know and love he gets the job done just fine, and rather adding some emotion into Big Boss's voice through sadness, shock, or humor all being translated well into the game. And subjectively speaking I rather like his new voice gives Big Boss some depth as opposed to the monotone and gruff voice that we use to have.\n\nGraphics: Wow thats all I can say... wow, wow, wow. The best looks to performance ratio game I've played in years, the game is very well optimized and I regard it highly as one of the best running games I have ever played. I was able to crank everything up to it's maximum settings at 1080p with an older gtx 660ti while still running it at a smooth 45-60fps. Now thats what you call optimization, a large number of settings are there for you to tweak to your hearts content from lighting detail to ssao and special effects it's all there for the taking. Heck I was able to get this running on an old laptop at 720p and it still ran great at 30fps, looked really good too, so don't be afraid to buy this software for an older running machine.\n\nThe Fox Engine is really being utilized to it's full potential here, some-things in the game from research I've done has actually been laser-scanned into the game such as rocks and twigsto add on to the ground, cinematography effects as well, depth of field, bokeh, and yes the infamous lens flare are all used to great extent in this game giving it as always a signature kojima flair that adds to the mood of the game, very reminiscint of film effects. Facial expressions and character models are highly detailed with each wrinkle on snake's face telling a story of his past and expressing emotion depending on the situation. Animations are out of this world good, acting in realistic ways whenever shooting, falling, or choking someone out and motion capture quality I haven't seen since a little game called "The Last Of Us".\n\nConclusion: "Half as long, twice as bright". "Short but sweet". These are the words that come to mind when investing my hard earned money into this game and playing through it again and again, simply pumping me up and setting the  bar higher for other developers to topple, there is loads of content here, new easter eggs to discover and accomplishments to topple in a mission. Buy this game with peace in mind that you will enjoy it, I give it my personal recommendation to everyone and anyone who enjoys gaming! Although be forwarned this is a "tactical espionage" game take it nice and slow the less people alerted the better.\nI hope you enjoyed my review, and as always have a nice day.\nFinal Score: 9/10","February 3, 2015","true","40.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The controls are great and the gunplay proves the game as a worthy third-person shooter, if that's how you choose to play. Although the main mission (yes, mission, without an S. There's only one story mission in GROUND ZEROES.) is fairly short, (it took me 99 minutes to complete on my first playthrough) there are 6 side missions that are included in GROUND ZEROES. Each of these missions vary in terms of gameplay, weather, and objective.\nMODDING\nAs mentioned above, there are mods available to unlock the framerate and disable the DoF. Modders are currently working on model editors, but you can currently modelswap very easily. For more information on that, check the community hub guides.\n\nTo wrap it all up, I'd have to say that METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES is one of the best games to come out this year. You're missing out if you don't purchase it. For 20 dollars, it's a steal.\n10/10","December 31, 2014","true","76.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

MGS V Ground Zeroes is prologue for upcoming Phantom Pain game.\nSo, what do you get for paying for that little piece of the game? Answer is: one location; one story mission; about 3-4 optional missions based on the same map, but featuring other objectives; some stuff that may introduce you to MGS story - 11 pages of MGS Peace Walker story, audio records with character' dialogues(MGS story is really damn huge, so you will be lost if you never played any MGS game before);\n\nMap is some US military base on Cuba, it's kinda small. This location features: truck, jeep and APC to try out vehicles in MGS series; some soldiers to try out upgraded CQC system and weapons.\n\nIt's not much, you can finish story mission in about a hour or two and then maybe make it no more than 10 hours doing other missions on the same little map.\n\nSo, this is basicly demonstration of gameplay mechanics in MGS V which is going to be [/b]first open world game in franchise[/b].\n\nAlso there is an option to upload save data to cloud and use it later in Phantom Pain, so actions in this "game" matter somehow or will be rewarded.\n\nAs a result: you can buy it or you can skip it, doesn't matter that much. At first i was like "buying demo? Meh...", but then i tried рirаte version and i had no other choice but pay a little price for this amazing work on PC version. This is first MGS game coming for PC after so many years on consoles and i want it to succeed on PC, so Kojima keeps making these awesome games for PC in future.\n\nThanks for reading.","December 19, 2014","true","15.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

There's a fair amount of stuff to do, I've gotten 18 hours out of it but I've pretty much run out of things to do, and half of that was due to modding.

Compared to Metal Gear Solid The Phantom Pain Ground Zeroes really only lasts about 1 mission in length. Given the fact that Phantom Pain has 50 missions and 150 side missions it's hard to recommend Ground Zeroes at full price. Really they should add this game into future game of the year editions of Phantom Pain. If you can get it on the cheap or on sale for less than $5 then it's worth going through to get the story sequence leading into Phantom Pain otherwise just read a synopsis of the plot from Ground Zeroes before playing Phantom Pain.\n\nSo put simply, if you like Metal Gear and you can get this cheap I recommend it. If you don't like Metal Gear and/or can't get this cheap then pass. I liked the game but can't really recommend it at retail price.

This is a game about exploration and experimentation. There is one main mission and six side missions, two of which are unlockable. If you just go through the missions just to beat them you'll probably get 4-5 hours of content, possibly more depending on how long it takes you to tackle those missions.\n\nThe real meat of the game is experimenting with the new fox engine and how to tackle those missions. For example there is a side mission where you have to assassinate two targets, now you can just go and kill them, you can go and grab a sniper rifle and take them out from a distance to more easily escape, you can extract both of the targets by chopper to get more information, it's up to you.\n\nThere's also prisoners and hidden secrets in every mission and context sensitive events that can be uncovered and triggered. All of these hidden secrets are the main story of this game. If you want to understand why certain characters act a certain way during the main game or what happened before you got there you have to uncover the tapes, they also potentially reveal information about The Phantom Pain. There's also XOF patches to find to unlock the two extra missions as well as unlockable weapons that can be placed at the starting point of each mission.\n\nThe gameplay is amazing in this game, with the addition of open world gameplay you have no radar so you have to mark and pay attention to enemies, there are such small details added that affect gameplay like the difference in knockout time between choking a guard, tranquilizing a guard and punching out a guard, how long a guard will stay asleep in a dark area versus a sunny area and other features. Reflex mode is an optional bullet time that triggers when you're spotted and it balances out the guard AI which can spot you from anywhere and from far distances especially on hard difficulty,\n\nAs a PC port of a console game this is one of the best PC ports I've ever played, there are so many customization options and it has been optimized perfectly and the controls are excellent with the exception of no mouse control in menus.\n\nThere is also a lot of mod support for this game and I have no doubt the modding community for this game will expand and produce more content in the future, this game is amazing and definitely worth the money if you can accept it as a new type of experience.","January 13, 2015","true","61.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I'm somewhat of a noob to the series, having only experienced MGS 1-4 via Chip & Ironicus' excellent and informative Let's Play series of them, so I'm familiar with the gameplay and story, just never played them myself.\n\nGround Zeroes is a playground. It gives you a bunch of tools and abilities and plops you down in a giant sandbox where you can use those things to your heart's content. This may only be a single prologue map, but the gameplay is deep enough that that's okay. You'll find yourself playing it over and over, doing things in different ways, trying out new things, or just goofing around. There are also alternate missions that change up the objectives as well as weather and time of day, creating a dramatically different looking and feeling game.\n\nOn the technical side of things, the port is mostly excellent, especially considering it's a Japanese developer, some of whom are still learning how to make a proper PC port (See: Dark Souls 1, Deadly Premonition, Final Fantasy XIII at launch, etc.). But MGS5 has graphics options out the wazoo, arbitrary resolutions, and is incredibly well optimized. On my i7 4770k and HD 7950, I get a constant 60 FPS at 1080p with everything on Extra High except for Shadows and SSAO down a notch to just "High". It looks fantastic. The one mark against it is the 60 FPS cap - for someone as obsessed with framerate as Kojima, I would expect him to not artificially limit the framerate. 120 and 144 Hz monitors are becoming increasingly common. It's smooth enough at 60, but worth mentioning.\n\nSome people malign this game as "just paying for a demo of Phantom Pain", but then this is the most feature-packed, most replayable, most awesome demo ever made, and (as you can see from my play time) I've gotten many hours of entertainment from it. Don't let the price throw you off - it's totally worth it.","December 20, 2014","true","16.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was about time! As stated - it's only a short prologue, but it's well produced and will give you a brief look, what you can expect from the upcoming full price title. I won't start to talk about the story or objective this time, because it's only one area and one story mission and you wouldn't discover anything on your own anymore. Please check the pro and contra list and the conclusion to make sure, if it could be worth your money or not.\n\n\nPro:\nit's a Metal Gear Solid!\ninteresting story\nvery good stealth action\ngreat port (enjoyable mouse+keyboard or controller navigation, no stupid 30 FPS lock, adjustable graphic settings)\nvery well optimized performance\ngreat graphics\ngreat cinematics\ngreat voice actors\ngreat soundtrack\nridable vehicles\nsome replay value thanks to different side missions and collectable stuff\nno crashes (for me)\n\nContra:\nvery short story mission (only 50-90 minutes depending on playstyle)\nprice tag (19,99 Euro) is too high for the delivered content  [the 13,39 Euro sale price tag is much more appropriate]\nsome knocked out or sleeping enemies can be displayed as standing for a moment from time to time, when you're reentering a certain area and then they will fall back to the ground\nsome knocked out or sleeping enemies can magically disappear and reappear (only happened once for me)\nyou can't drag people while crawling\nugly subtitle font\n\nConclusion:\n'Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes' is nothing more than a short appetizer for the upcoming 'The Phantom Pain', but it's a very good one for every MGS fan. It will satisfy your desire for the moment and make you hungry for more at the same time...I'm still not sure, if that's a good or a bad thing. This prologue is a must-have for every fan, but it's absolutely nothing for people, who haven't played a MGS before and/or have no clue about what the heck 'The Phantom Pain' is due to the minor content. And don't be afraid of (another) awful port, it's really well done and optimized.\n\n\n8/10   ...Snake?

I'm somewhat of a noob to the series, having only experienced MGS 1-4 via Chip & Ironicus' excellent and informative Let's Play series of them, so I'm familiar with the gameplay and story, just never played them myself.\n\nGround Zeroes is a playground. It gives you a bunch of tools and abilities and plops you down in a giant sandbox where you can use those things to your heart's content. This may only be a single prologue map, but the gameplay is deep enough that that's okay. You'll find yourself playing it over and over, doing things in different ways, trying out new things, or just goofing around. There are also alternate missions that change up the objectives as well as weather and time of day, creating a dramatically different looking and feeling game.\n\nOn the technical side of things, the port is mostly excellent, especially considering it's a Japanese developer, some of whom are still learning how to make a proper PC port (See: Dark Souls 1, Deadly Premonition, Final Fantasy XIII at launch, etc.). But MGS5 has graphics options out the wazoo, arbitrary resolutions, and is incredibly well optimized. On my i7 4770k and HD 7950, I get a constant 60 FPS at 1080p with everything on Extra High except for Shadows and SSAO down a notch to just "High". It looks fantastic. The one mark against it is the 60 FPS cap - for someone as obsessed with framerate as Kojima, I would expect him to not artificially limit the framerate. 120 and 144 Hz monitors are becoming increasingly common. It's smooth enough at 60, but worth mentioning.\n\nSome people malign this game as "just paying for a demo of Phantom Pain", but then this is the most feature-packed, most replayable, most awesome demo ever made, and (as you can see from my play time) I've gotten many hours of entertainment from it. Don't let the price throw you off - it's totally worth it.","December 20, 2014","true","16.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When I play MGRising, i was amazed of how great a PC port could be. I've been seen lazy ports coming to PC very often and i was beginning to lose faith, now i have Konami once again to thank. About the game, it is indeed very, very short. Campaign doesn't last, everyone knows this, my problem with this matter was the unfair cost in console version, but once again Steam brought justice. If you end the game in 1 hour or less, know that you'll take quite a time to play side missions, they are challenging and much fun.","December 20, 2014","true","28.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was about time! As stated - it's only a short prologue, but it's well produced and will give you a brief look, what you can expect from the upcoming full price title. I won't start to talk about the story or objective this time, because it's only one area and one story mission and you wouldn't discover anything on your own anymore. Please check the pro and contra list and the conclusion to make sure, if it could be worth your money or not.\n\n\nPro:\nit's a Metal Gear Solid!\ninteresting story\nvery good stealth action\ngreat port (enjoyable mouse+keyboard or controller navigation, no stupid 30 FPS lock, adjustable graphic settings)\nvery well optimized performance\ngreat graphics\ngreat cinematics\ngreat voice actors\ngreat soundtrack\nridable vehicles\nsome replay value thanks to different side missions and collectable stuff\nno crashes (for me)\n\nContra:\nvery short story mission (only 50-90 minutes depending on playstyle)\nprice tag (19,99 Euro) is too high for the delivered content  [the 13,39 Euro sale price tag is much more appropriate]\nsome knocked out or sleeping enemies can be displayed as standing for a moment from time to time, when you're reentering a certain area and then they will fall back to the ground\nsome knocked out or sleeping enemies can magically disappear and reappear (only happened once for me)\nyou can't drag people while crawling\nugly subtitle font\n\nConclusion:\n'Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes' is nothing more than a short appetizer for the upcoming 'The Phantom Pain', but it's a very good one for every MGS fan. It will satisfy your desire for the moment and make you hungry for more at the same time...I'm still not sure, if that's a good or a bad thing. This prologue is a must-have for every fan, but it's absolutely nothing for people, who haven't played a MGS before and/or have no clue about what the heck 'The Phantom Pain' is due to the minor content. And don't be afraid of (another) awful port, it's really well done and optimized.\n\n\n8/10   ...Snake?

Despite it only having 1 map to play on, it's pretty large and almost everyside OP has you playing in different parts of said map, at different times. And if the side OPs weren't enough, there's even extra-OPs which allow you to play as Raiden and Classic Snake. Which adds even more gameplay to the whole thing.

And some great features added (though I was dissapointed that I couldnt throw bodies over the cliff face to hide them, that is just stupid.)\n\nHave moved onto the side missions, they are cool. Again, really feels like a testing ground for the mechanics really, and they are good fun.\n\nGraphically, amazing.

For the price though, I would say it's worth it (I say this during a sale).\n\nA word of caution: Even though the game runs incredibly well, the options in the options menu have negligible performance benefit. Either it runs or it doesn't, changing settings won't take it from 20 to 60 no matter what you do.

I can run this on a laptop that isn't high end so it's clearly well made as has been pointed out below.\n\nPros:\nDifferent approaches available. The open world and the way you personally handle the mission is up to you and no one else. Sneak or kick the door in, your choice.\n\n\nTight controls, no longer do you have to wait for Snake to drop to his belly. He does it ASAP.\n\nHeard that it would be very short and I beg to differ. It's big enough. It may not be huge, but it's enough.\n\nCons:\nThe guards you treathen with the knife does not talk. I hate that. They did in MGS3. They moan and subtitles appear. They should talk too.\n\nCamera makes it a bit hard to see when you are sneaking close to a wall.\n\nI miss some movements from older games, like being able to walk along a wall by your own will. Snake goes into cover automtically(which works very well) but I would like to be able to walk along the wall like in Snake Eater, or at the very least like in MGS4, where you press a button to lean against the wall.

If this doesn't apply to you because you have yet to play Ground Zeroes because you are waiting for the Phantom Pain, then I would say to go ahead and buy it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/recommended/311340/","Anitude","Annie T. Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","Ran real well on my medium-high end craptop (settings mostly set to high and still ran great without any problems) and just downright played great on keyboard & mouse (except for the movement when trying to turn around and when you try to choose some options while you have someone in a chokehold. You have to hold one key to enter interrogation [default: Q] and while you're holding said key you have to press another key with the same hand to choose a dialogue option [default: 1, 2, 3] which can be straining to many).\nWhen trying to lean against some small cover (while crouching especially) Snake tends to put his head out just enough for anything on the other side to see which can be highly detremental for those just attempting to touch a surface of, for example, a small box. When that happens even trying to back your body out of sight can be difficult as Snake also tends to get his whole body out of cover.\nThe sensitivy for aiming in first person mode is way too high even when set to the lowest it can go in the options menu, which can highly affect perfect shots with snipers when looking through the lense or even just using the binoculars without looking too far off somewhere. A controller is much more recommended for these moments.\n\nIt's a third-person shooter when you let it become a shooter (which is unrecommended and isn't the initial point but that's the player's choice).\nThe guns work really well here; they spread quite a bit if you hold down the trigger too long (as with most other shooters) and there's bullet drop which is much more noticeable with the sniper and the tranquilizer gun.\nIt's a wonderful stealth game with incredible AI where the enemy can spot you immediately if you're seen close enough to them, though if you're far enough from view they'll just check out whatever unusual thing that was in the distance. If you're in view for too long too far away they'll "check out a suspected individual" or "check out something suspicious going on." Close enough to them and you're in view for too long they'll recognize you, set the whole area to combat status, and start engaging immediately (unless you neutralize them fast enough and if they're alone before they set the entire island into combat status) which you can then run and hide until the heat wears off or shoot back until you're in the clear, though reinforcements usually keep coming if they notice that their live soldier count is dwindling. You can also experiment with how you can be sneaky in this game (ie: get most of the solders's attention away from your goal by detonating a C4 to destroy an AA gun that was placed really far away from where you're going).\n\nThere are just so many great things in this game that I most likely still haven't even squeezed out despite my tons of hours and completion rate into it. This is one of those games I think where learning on your own what you can do with what you have to help get you from A to B is part of the joy and fun. As stated many times in many other places though, the only big negative thing about this is that it's pretty much a demo: it's too short for a full priced game. For fans and just the right people this is an incredible piece to have and play.","December 19, 2014","true","111.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Splinter Cell or Hitman? The Metal Gear Solid series is much older and rich on lore already, Hideo Kojima, the main director has so many cards up his sleeve that he can flip the table and say "♥♥♥♥ it." and still make a good game it seems.\n\nThis series started on the PlayStation 1 where you control Solid Snake, then through many games and jumps in time, in this game, you control his father, Naked Snake, also known as Big Boss, who is on a mission to rescue Pacifica "Paz" and Ricardo "Chico" from a Blacksite in Cuba. it's pretty much freeroam from then on, as long as you extract both targets alive. you can drive jeeps, use missile launchers, hand grenades, C4 and claymores.\n\nOR you can use the ever-famous stealth tactics. Sneak around corners, knock on walls or throw empty magazines to attract the enemy or lure them off, use a tranquilizer pistol ot if necessary, a silenced automatic rifle. For extraction, you call in a chopper, Either by your PDA/Phone/"iDroid" or by tossing a signaling smoke grenade.\n\nThe amount of freedom is massive and I believe the sequel, "The Phantom Pain" will be more entertaining than GTA V, atleast for me.\n\nWARNING: It's a prequel! Don't pay more than 15-20€ etc. but on sale, it's 100% worth it. EVEN for a prequel.","July 10, 2015","true","42.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I absolutely despise the\nRestriction this puts on player freedom and as far as I am concerned its ♥♥♥♥ing lazy dev\n♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that restricts players movement, playstyle and risk and reward based play.\n\nI am a player who loves stealthy approaches. I will do a part in a game over 50 times if I\nhave to in order to get the mission to go how I want it to. That is just me that is how\nI play and how I enjoy games personally. I love getting in and getting out without any\none knowing I was ever there. Hence titles like Dishonored, Deus Ex and Thief were an\nabsolute joy. They allowed the player to try different things over and over again with the\nquicksave button to get the result they want. That is how I like to play.\n\nMetal Gear Solid does not allow this. The stealth mechanics and game mechanics are solid\nand enjoyable, the graphics are quite nice. The over all game is solid and enjoyable.\nMemorizing guard patterns finding a new way into a base its all great. The weapons are\nclunky (and improved in MSG5) but the overall experience is a good one. HOWEVER the\ncheck point system is a pile of rancid ♥♥♥♥. I had to play several sequences over about\n30-50 times to no get caught by random Guard RnG or some other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that limited\nhow I wanted to play. I lost a 40 minute segment of gameplay in which I was undetected\nand had to spend hours on recreating because of one screw up. This is not fun. I was\nforced to do this sequence over and over again because I wanted the gameplay to be\nindicative of MY playstyle not what the developer wanted or was too lazy to think out\nside the box for.\n\nI am sure I will hear a lot of learn to play etc, you are not supposed to play like that\nwell I couldn't care less. This is my opinion of the game. I hate MSG5 for the exact\nsame reasons. Checkpoints are gameplay limiting and cancer for player choice and\nfreedom.\n\nDespite me nearly rage quitting and uninstalling the game and promptly deleting the game\nfrom my steam library forever I will mention a bit more from an objective point of view.\n\nThe experience in Ground Zeroes is short. It only involves one map/base. There is a short\nstory sequence that leads into MSG5. So if you must know what happens or if you are new\nto Metal Gear I'd probably recommend it. For about 3-5 dollars. Its basically a tech\ndemo for MSG5. This game is not worth even 10 dollars because its not enough of a game.\nIf you are hardcore fan sure get it, because you will probably love every second of it.\nFor those others who are new, its not necessary but an enjoyable introduction to the\nfranchise IF you can deal with checkpoint frustration. I personally was barely able to.\n\nThat being said this is a cautious recommendation on the cheap.","December 14, 2015","true","4.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That's its core purpose. It introduces a number of items that will be present in MGSV:TPP, and closes with a cinematic (Kojima suprise) that leads into MGSV:TPP.\n\nThe core mission itself is short. Extract two targets in a relatively small base, and get out. There are a litter of unspecified side-objectives that contribute to your overall score at the conclusion of the mission, but they aren't anything particularly major. If you're terrible like I am, it'll take you about an hour, maybe more. If you're much more practiced, then you'll be through far more quickly.\nAnd then it finishes. Done. Ground Zeroes main story is done and dusted, just like that.\n\nThe real meat comes in later on. The 'side ops' will have you running back through the black site again, with different objectives. The one I just completed - for instance - required me to assassinate two targets. Same again with the score increasing side-objectives.\nEach run through the base will have different effects in play. For instance, the Ground Zeroes mission will have you infiltrate in the night and in the rain. The assassination mission requires you to sneak through the site in broad daylight. These, coupled with some fiendishly well hidden collectibles (XOF patches) and achievement specific mission executions are what will generate the bulk of the time spent playing this game.\n\nThe core mechanics are very sound. The stealth is superb, with enemies being observant (but not unfairly so) and reacting in a believable manner.\nWere you spotted for a split second? Instead of jamming their fingers on the alarm button, the guards will observe the suspicious area for a time and if nothing of note occurs, they will return to their posts.\nYou can intimidate, interrogate and just generally silence guards without firing a shot. Move in close, raise your weapon and they will surrender. From there, you can do with them as you please.\n\nThe game is stunning, with some beautiful weather effects coming through and superbly detailed textures. Also optimised extraordinarily well - I had no troubles with this game at all.\nThe only 'bug' that I really noticed was some pop-in, but that only occurred as I performed a quick 360 degree glance after restarting at a checkpoint.\n\nOkay, the recommendation.\n\nShould you play this? Yes. However,I feel compelled to point out that, despite the production values, this feels increasingly like a demo for the upcoming game. Is it fun and fleshed out? Absolutely. The lack of content may bother some people.\n\nIf you can get it on sale, do so.","June 14, 2015","true","6.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Much different than the older games, no camo index this time around. It makes the game better in a way since you don't have to worry about wether your camo is high enough, you can focus on the task at hand. I can run this on a laptop that isn't high end so it's clearly well made as has been pointed out below.\n\nPros:\nDifferent approaches available. The open world and the way you personally handle the mission is up to you and no one else. Sneak or kick the door in, your choice.\n\n\nTight controls, no longer do you have to wait for Snake to drop to his belly. He does it ASAP.\n\nHeard that it would be very short and I beg to differ. It's big enough. It may not be huge, but it's enough.\n\nCons:\nThe guards you treathen with the knife does not talk. I hate that. They did in MGS3. They moan and subtitles appear. They should talk too.\n\nCamera makes it a bit hard to see when you are sneaking close to a wall.\n\nI miss some movements from older games, like being able to walk along a wall by your own will. Snake goes into cover automtically(which works very well) but I would like to be able to walk along the wall like in Snake Eater, or at the very least like in MGS4, where you press a button to lean against the wall. But I reckon I'll get used to it.\n\nThat's pretty much it from me. You won't get disappointed.

The  "demo"  that's a fantastic port, and runs 1080p 60fps on a Geforce GTX 660M, not to mention the stunning graphics. The  "demo"  that is the prologue to MGSV: TPP, a game that's coming very soon. In order to fully appreciate TPP, you need to play Ground Zeros; it's like skipping the first 3 chapters in a book and expecting to understand the rest.\n\nIf you bought this game, you already know what it is and what you're getting into, if not, then keep reading.\nMGSV:GZ is the prologue to MGSV:TPP (The Phantom Pain). It was a bit of a shock to the general public to release just the game's prologue, however, the masterminds at Konami knew what they were doing all along.\n\nThe game comes with around 7 (8? I can't rememer) missions, one of which is important to the MGS canon. This is the titicular "Ground Zeros" mission, where, barring spoilers, Snake rescues two prisioners from a black site in Cuba. It is averaged in 2 hours, however, somebody has speedran it in 12 minutes, much to the delight of naysayers and critics of the series. Nonetheless, the hours upon hours of extra content are sure to keep you entertained.\n\nI have played a total of 6 hours so far, and the game came out a few days ago. This is coming from somebody where half of my library are games I haven't even sunk an hour into. This game is seriously addicting and fun. The keyboard and mouse controls are mostly on point, but it did take me a bit to get used to. I even prefer them to using a controller, honestly. Konami/Kojima Productions did a fantastic job on that regard.\nThe graphics are beautiful, enough said. Check out some screenshots for the game and be the judge. There are no prerendered cutscenes and the lighting and shadows are breathtaking at high levels. The Fox Engine is truely a force to be rekoned with. I'd expect The Phantom Pain to really push it to the limit.\n\nAll things considered, this game, while not a masterpiece, is certainly an entertaining game and could keep you busy for hours. As previously stated, I have spend 6 hours so far, and I'm only at 30% completion. Completionists rejoice.\n\nIf this game is just a demo, it's the best ♥♥♥♥ing demo I've ever played.","December 20, 2014","true","45.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Despite this however, the story in Ground Zeroes is a very strong one, especially considering that the game was designed to inform fans of  the events that occurred before Phantom Pain.\n\nA story in a Video Game or Movie however, is only as great as it is visually portrayed, Thankfully, the game looks beautiful. Kojima's previous installment to the series "Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of Patriots" was a big step in visuals for its time. In fact, most Metal Games exceed expectations in terms of visuals.  Ground Zeroes is no exception. It has surpassed the visuals of Guns of Patriots by a long shot. The environment, the structures and the other soldiers look incredible.  If you haven't already,  simply watch the first cinematic on Youtube. It doesn't give away too much, but rather gives a small introduction as to what you will be required to do for the mission.  What you see in the first cinematic is a strong representation as to what you can expect from this game in terms of visuals. You will not be let down.\n\nSound quality is also something that you will be amazed by. Most objects/actions you hear is very accurate in comparision to its real world counterpart.\n\nDue to the small length of the game, many will argue it is difficult for the player to grow attached to any of the characters at this point in time which I do agree with to some extent. That is something you will have to judge yourself IF you do decide to purchase this game.\n\nAnother thing to note is that I strongly believe this game appeals towards fans who have played previous installments as opposed to those who begin on this game. It does touch on events and reference Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker which may confuse some players. The game does give a very brief summary of the events that occurred in these titles but one may argue it's not enough.  If you have never played a Metal Gear Solid game do not start on this game. A HD collection was recently released containing both Snake Eater AND Peace Walker along with another popular title. Do yourself a favor and purchase it.\n\nWhilst the stealth aspects of this game are great and work incredibly well, veterans will be disappointed to find the lack of new creative methods of concealing yourself. Bushes and shrubs similar to those from Snake Eater were my best friend throughout the story along with the tranq gun. However, I (personally) couldn't find nothing more than that. I may of missed it, but it certainly was not a prominent feature (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nThe game does include "spec-ops" missions that attempt to extend the overall game time. I personally have not played them at this point in time but do intend on doing so.\n\nTo summaries, if your interested a beautifully presented stealth (which means not "runnin' and gunnin") title WHICH is not too long, Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes will certainly not disappoint.\n\nPROS:\n-BEAUTIFUL VISUALS\n-FREE OF GAME BREAKING BUGS\n-SOUND QUALITY IS FANTASTIC\n-STEALTH MECHANICS...HOWEVER (SEE CON POINT 2)\n-DRAMATIC AND EXCITING STORY\n\nCONS:\n-TIME TO COMPLETE MAIN STORY IS SMALL\n-LACKING IN HIDING SPOTS\n-MANY ARGUE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE\n-NEWCOMERS MAY NOT UNDERSTAND SOME REFERENCES TO THE EXPECTED EXTENT.\n\nFinal rating: 4/5.\n\nIf anyone disagrees with something I have said or is confused on something, feel free to comment.","December 31, 2014","true","3.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I am safe to say that the FOX engine is one of the best "next gen" engines to be designed, so much love and work has been given to it and it really shows.\n\nIf you are a fan of the Metal Gear Series this is definetly a must buy, if you're not a fan of the Metal Gear Series, so go play the games, get to know them, and then you'll be temped to buy this for sure.

Despite this however, the story in Ground Zeroes is a very strong one, especially considering that the game was designed to inform fans of  the events that occurred before Phantom Pain.\n\nA story in a Video Game or Movie however, is only as great as it is visually portrayed, Thankfully, the game looks beautiful. Kojima's previous installment to the series "Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of Patriots" was a big step in visuals for its time. In fact, most Metal Games exceed expectations in terms of visuals.  Ground Zeroes is no exception. It has surpassed the visuals of Guns of Patriots by a long shot. The environment, the structures and the other soldiers look incredible.  If you haven't already,  simply watch the first cinematic on Youtube. It doesn't give away too much, but rather gives a small introduction as to what you will be required to do for the mission.  What you see in the first cinematic is a strong representation as to what you can expect from this game in terms of visuals. You will not be let down.\n\nSound quality is also something that you will be amazed by. Most objects/actions you hear is very accurate in comparision to its real world counterpart.\n\nDue to the small length of the game, many will argue it is difficult for the player to grow attached to any of the characters at this point in time which I do agree with to some extent. That is something you will have to judge yourself IF you do decide to purchase this game.\n\nAnother thing to note is that I strongly believe this game appeals towards fans who have played previous installments as opposed to those who begin on this game. It does touch on events and reference Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker which may confuse some players. The game does give a very brief summary of the events that occurred in these titles but one may argue it's not enough.  If you have never played a Metal Gear Solid game do not start on this game. A HD collection was recently released containing both Snake Eater AND Peace Walker along with another popular title. Do yourself a favor and purchase it.\n\nWhilst the stealth aspects of this game are great and work incredibly well, veterans will be disappointed to find the lack of new creative methods of concealing yourself. Bushes and shrubs similar to those from Snake Eater were my best friend throughout the story along with the tranq gun. However, I (personally) couldn't find nothing more than that. I may of missed it, but it certainly was not a prominent feature (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nThe game does include "spec-ops" missions that attempt to extend the overall game time. I personally have not played them at this point in time but do intend on doing so.\n\nTo summaries, if your interested a beautifully presented stealth (which means not "runnin' and gunnin") title WHICH is not too long, Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes will certainly not disappoint.\n\nPROS:\n-BEAUTIFUL VISUALS\n-FREE OF GAME BREAKING BUGS\n-SOUND QUALITY IS FANTASTIC\n-STEALTH MECHANICS...HOWEVER (SEE CON POINT 2)\n-DRAMATIC AND EXCITING STORY\n\nCONS:\n-TIME TO COMPLETE MAIN STORY IS SMALL\n-LACKING IN HIDING SPOTS\n-MANY ARGUE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE\n-NEWCOMERS MAY NOT UNDERSTAND SOME REFERENCES TO THE EXPECTED EXTENT.\n\nFinal rating: 4/5.\n\nIf anyone disagrees with something I have said or is confused on something, feel free to comment.","December 31, 2014","true","3.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If a person isn't a Metal Gear fan, I can't recommend this game. The true value of this game is the replayability and the Side Ops, both of which would not be attractive to your average gamer. I, however, love Metal Gear to the extent where I have played each game multiple times and I actually own Ground Zeroes on PS3, PS4, and now PC and I can honestly say if you're willing to devote the effort to learning how to git gud, this game is an amazing value.\n\nAnother things that may be a turn off is the story. In order to enjoy the story to it's fullest extend, you should play all the other Metal Gear Solid games, although only MGS3 and MGS:PW are truly "required" to understand the story. If you don't care for story though, the gameplay is so refined it's just an amazing game.

Game's mission was showing players new Fox Engine and how real game The Phantom Pain will be. Well we can say Ground Zeroes succeeded.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Story is of course not detailed as old MGS games (because of 1-2 hours long story mission) but it's good.\n\n+ Gameplay is freaking awesome. Controls, stealth elements are really good and gameplay is sooo tactical.\n\n+ Because of tactical gameplay game has a high replay value.\n\n+ Graphics are really really good. Well game was looking very good on PS4 but on PC... It looks gorgeous.\n\n+ Optimization's amazing. Other developers should take notes from this game's optimization.\n\n+ Enemy AI is one of the bests i've ever seen.\n\nCons:\n\n- Even for a prologue game's too short.\n\n- Because of main mission being too short game has only few chracters. Most of them are from old games, GZ only introduced one new character to the series.\n\n- I don't know is this game really considers as an open world, but game's map is too small and has got only few interesting things to explore.\n\n- Like I said gamplay is amazing but it has one flaw: There's too little guns - items to use.","June 18, 2015","true","48.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Incredibly optimised as well, runs everything on high at 45 fps on my crappy 550ti. Incredibly fun, to boot. My only complaints are the lack of manual save and the pretty bad cover system. Also, to anyone else who was having trouble with your controller, try waiting to plug it in to your computer until the game gets to the main menu.\n\nGraphics-9/10 Foxengine is incredibly beutiful, and will run well on anything.\nLength-8/10 Short, but sweet, and makes you excited for Phantom Pain. Plus, the Extras and Side Ops add a lot of replayability.\nSound-9/10 All characters, even guards, sound great. Kiefer Sutherland is no Hayter, but he does a surprisingly good job as Big Boss. Gun sounds are crisp, and music is amazing.\nGameplay-8/10 Great controls and everything feels great. However, the cover system is not great and you often pop out in front of a guard when you don't mean to. Also sometimes guards can see you through stuff. Gunplay is a little strange, but it should be, as it isn't a shooter, it's a stealth game. You didn't see great gunplay in SC: Chaos Theory, and that's one of the greatest stealth games of all time.\nOVERALL-8.5/10	 I would reccomend this game to any Metal Gear fan, or fans of stealth games in general. This definitely goes up there with Chaos Theory and Mark of the Ninja as one of my all time favorite stealth games. If you haven't played a Metal Gear game before, however, I'm not sure if you would like ths however.\n\nI absolutely can't wait for Phantom Pain.

The GZ map is tightly focused with loads of replayability.\n\nIn addition, GZ is a lot darker than TPP, referencing r.ape (one of Chico's tapes) and showing large and detailed amounts of gore (cutting the bomb out of Paz). Skull Face is so evil in Ground Zeroes, but he is a joke in The Phantom Pain.\n\nAlso, the plot in GZ is way better than TPP. It made fans hyped for what was to come in TPP. In TPP, all we got a goofy villain with bad voice acting and a horrible plot twist which made the game completely worthless to play.\n\nLet's talk about the difficulty level now. The Phantom Pain is way too easy, being much more forgiving than Ground Zeroes. In GZ, you really have to work towards an S rank in every mission. It will challenge you. You don't have a horse, a dog, or an almost nude sniper to help you in Ground Zeroes. You have yourself and your IDroid.\n\nGround Zeroes feels way more like a Metal Gear game. What the hell, Phantom Pain? Creating a face in a Metal Gear game for a poorly written plot twist at the end of the game? It seems like they tried to innovate the MG franchise with TPP, but it failed spectacularly.\n\nTo sum up, Ground Zeroes shows us what The Phantom Pain should've and could've been. This isn't to say that The Phantom Pain was an awful game, as it did make many improvements on the movement, gunplay, and UI, but it could've been far better.","May 28","true","22.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Despite this, I've been constantly impressed by not only the beautiful textures, lighting and physics, but also the very fluid gameplay.

It is a single level so don't expect hours and hours of gameplay.\n\nWith that warning in place, this game is fantastic.  VERY solid gameplay and machanics.  I've been a Metal Gear fan for years and have played every single game they have made.  Story line is complicated as all hell but a lot of fun.\n\nTo keep this short and sweet.  No glitches, no bugs, gameplay is tight, story is intriguing.   If you are new to the Metal Gear universe this is a great place to start.  Be advised there is a HUGE amount of backstory to what is going on.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gagusa/recommended/311340/","Gagusa","Afevis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gagusa/","1959 products in account","This game is a prologue to what is clearly going to be the next of Hideo Kojima's masterpieces. It is the new Pièce de résistance of the Metal Gear series.\n\nYou'll see complaints about the length of this game. To clarify, the main mission in this game averages around an hour and forty minutes long. There are also numerous side missions to complete, which bump the playtime up to an average of six hours long.\n\nTo complete the game 100%, that is collecting all cassette tapes, getting all accolades in-game, rescuing everybody you're supposed to, and getting the best rank you can in the game, unlocking absolutely everything there is to unlock, you're looking at an average of at least 16 and a half hours of game-play out of this game.\n\nTo reiterate, if you play it just for the main mission and put it down after that, you're going to be disappointed. The intent with the release of this product was for fans of the series to try out the new game, get performance statistics over a wide series of systems, and see how the community responded to major changes in how the game operated.\n\nChoose your own destiny. Are you going to play this as a four minute speed-run of just one mission, or are you going to actually completely play the game and enjoy every last bit of what you paid for?\n\n\nPerformance is excellent. You can tell that the Fox engine has been given tons of love with a multiplatform focus being the centric point behind it. Running a GeForce 660, I'm able to achieve 60FPS constantly in all situations with all settings maxxed (with the exception of SSAO being on high as opposed to very high.)\n\nThe controls are excellent, keyboard and mouse users will not be disappointed - you can rebind any key to where you want. Yes, I know it sounds ridiculous for me to even have to say that, but you'd be surprised with the massive number of shoddy console ports that have left this most basic function out. There are also a number of default controller layouts available for users whom are using standardized gamepads.\n\nLikewise, one of the most common complaints people have about the controls is the usage of arrow keys while in the menus - however they are not necessary. Somehow, everybody has overlooked the big prompts that say "1" and "3" in the menus, which should typically be enough to tell people that instead of relying on arrow keys to move the menus left and right, you can just use the "1" and "3" keys to scroll left and right respectively.\n\nStory - 10/10. Yes, it's short, but this is intended as a prologue for the main game. The cassette tapes which can be found in all the missions provide more tastes of the story, making you desire for more.\n\nKojima-san, you magnificent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, why do you tease us so?","December 28, 2014","true","194.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Don't blame me, I love Metal Gear story.\n.\nGraphics - 8/10. Graphics are awesome, especially the AO, which is generally a necessity in stealth games like this, Hitman and Splinter Cell.\n.\nGameplay - 9/10. Think of what you would be able to do if you were to carry out a mission like this one. You can do all of that in Ground Zeroes. It has everything from shooting from a distance to holding up an enemy and asking for Intel. Enemy AI is as realistic as you can think it to be. (Assassin's Creed and Batman Arkham series suck at this) (AC-U is still fine. For other ACs, the Assassin roams like a boss) For a 100% realistic gameplay, turn off Reflex from Game Settings and turn off everything from Display Settings. (Display, not Graphics) Cardboard boxes, I miss. :crie:\n.\nPC Port - 10/10. 1366x768 high-extrahigh even on an HP P077TX. No bugs at all. I played it on a Lenovo Y50 at 1920x1080 high-extrahigh settings. I completed the game using both, a controller (twice) as well as mouse/keyboard (six or seven times). Have to say that the controls feel much better using mouse/keyboard.\n.\nOST - 8/10. Not as much attention-catching as those of the predecessors, but still good one. Alert phase BGM actually increases my heartbeat. Here's To You is something you can't forget, but if I am right, it was a part of MGS4 too. (Never got to play MGS4, fml no PS3)\n.\nEaster Eggs - 8/10. (I know that you're not gonna simply play for easter egg, but just saying) Easter Eggs are something that have always been frequent in MGS series. There are not as much easter eggs as there have been in other MGS games, but still there are a good amount of them. Deja Vu mission is something that's a whole Easter Egg in itself. You get to rescue a special someone in Intel Operative Rescue side op (won't name him and spoil the fun for you). Jamais Vu lets you play as Raiden, which has an easter egg from TMNT. (Kaz would say cowabunga instead of Horosho if you turn off the subtitles)\n.\nOverall - I bought the game for like 300 INR (~5 USD). Have to say that EVERY BUCK OF IT IS WELL SPENT. Must buy game.","March 6, 2015","true","25.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Main objective lasts for about 30 minutes, but there are other objectives after that and achievements you can unlock. Cool way to wait for Phantom Pain. Affordable at a discount, not really worth it for the full initial price though.\nThe content is good. PC version has all the stuff that consoles had released, so overall, It can suffice for quite few hours altoghether.\nIt doesn't FEEL like a full game though. Grapics are quite decent at max, but not overly spectacular.\nThe biggest shortcoming I would notice, is that it looks very similiar to Splinter Cell at this point, but it didn't loose all the MGS feel yet.\n\nIt makes me want to get my hands on Phantom Pain even more though. I'd rate this 8/10, 9/10 If you liked to follow the (twisted) MGS storylines... AND 7/10 if you include how much time you actually get to spend with the title, over a small military base.\n\nOh, and it loads surprisingly fast.

Here's to you from Ennio Morricone is the top track. But the music in game is great as well.\n- The story. This is a short Prequel for The Phantom Pain but it's so dense and surprising. Very intense scenes.\n- Various side missions that show the different sides of the gameplay, demonstrating how the same base can be reused in so many different ways. There's also a memento mission where you recreate metal gear solid's moments and a Raiden Mission XD.\n\n---Cons---- It's Short, but considering it's a prequel...

I bought this game 75% off, so it was reasonably cheap and I enjoyed it so that is why I'm recommending it. However, make sure you buy this game on sale because it really isn't much. The entire game has one main mission and only one map. There are other side-missions, but not many and they all use the same map as the main mission.\n\nIn conclusion, only buy this game if there is a really good sale. If not, do not purchase.

Main objective lasts for about 30 minutes, but there are other objectives after that and achievements you can unlock. Cool way to wait for Phantom Pain. Affordable at a discount, not really worth it for the full initial price though.\nThe content is good. PC version has all the stuff that consoles had released, so overall, It can suffice for quite few hours altoghether.\nIt doesn't FEEL like a full game though. Grapics are quite decent at max, but not overly spectacular.\nThe biggest shortcoming I would notice, is that it looks very similiar to Splinter Cell at this point, but it didn't loose all the MGS feel yet.\n\nIt makes me want to get my hands on Phantom Pain even more though. I'd rate this 8/10, 9/10 If you liked to follow the (twisted) MGS storylines... AND 7/10 if you include how much time you actually get to spend with the title, over a small military base.\n\nOh, and it loads surprisingly fast. Seriously, seconds.\n\nI recommend getting this demo, but at  discount. :)","December 19, 2014","true","14.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dylanai/recommended/311340/","dylanai","Luminaire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dylanai/","500 products in account","I'm playing this after logging around 175 hours in The Phantom Pain (TPP), so this experience is to me more akin to a DLC episode than a demo of things to come as it was intended. With that said, I am surprised by how different Ground Zeroes is than TPP - it doesn't include the mother base management aspects, naturally, and the graphics & controls are almost identical (if a bit less polished and fluid), but this is much more of a typical Metal Gear Solid experience than TPP. A patient stealth approach is not merely an option - it is absolutely crucial to completing the main story mission and 3 of the 4 side ops. If you're detected, shooting your way out of the predicament and hiding until the ruckus dies down is extremely difficult; chances are you will be killed and have to restart at the previous checkpoint (which, as in TPP, are far and few in between). You're also playing in a much smaller, denser area that more closely resembles a level from previous MGS titles than anything in TPP.\n\nGiven the amount of content and replay value (lots of collectibles, optional mission objectives, and two unlockable "extra ops" missions they really make you work for), you can get up to 20 hours out of this if it strikes your fancy. If you've yet to play The Phantom Pain, consider this prologue optional, as its story (which is heavily convoluted and easily the weakest point of Ground Zeroes) can be summed up in a paragraph or viewed in a YouTube video. If you've already played TPP and are looking to expand your experience as I was, this is worth a purchase, but only on sale for $5 or less. I personally am happy I played them in reverse order, as this would've given me false expectations of TPP and because purchasing it later allowed me to get it for only four dollars.","April 7","true","3.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Ground Zeroes is a great looking game, especially if you are running it from a mid-high tier machine or above. It's very well optimized and shows noticeable improvement from it's console counterpart.\n\nIf you're into the MGS series this is an easy recommendation, but every one needs to be aware that your first play through will only be between 2-4 hours depending on how you play. It's not a lot, and certainly much less from what we've come to be used to from AAA release. But the game does offer multiple ways to play, and gives incentive to multiple playthroghs. If you are to look at a game like Transistor which is about the same price, it also only has 2-4 hours first time through. From that perspective I feel I can still recommend MGSV:GZ even with it's short play time.\n\nOverall I enjoyed what the game had to offer and I am very very excited for the Phantom Pain\n\nPros:\n- Great visuals\n- Great optimization for the PC\n- Classic MGS gameplay\n- Multiple ways to play, multiple playthrough possibilities\n\nCons:\n- Very short for a AAA release\n- Only features one area","December 23, 2014","true","5.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

But sadly is just a fancy demo that was not given out for free because of Konami's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ business shemes. Until it's free I don't recommend you to buy it.\n\nLONG REVIEW:\n\nSTORY: You play as Big Boss, going to an an American black site on Cuban soil called Camp Omega to extract two prisoners to get infomation on Cipher. The cutscenes are amazing and even beautiful at that, it'll suck you right in at the start and a great opening to TPP.\n\nSTORY: 7/10\n\nGAMEPLAY: The gameplay is just like any other Metal Gear, sneaking around, snubbing out guards, you get the idea. But compared to MGS4 it improves the gameplay in every way, in that aspect it's amazing.\n\nGAMEPLAY: 10/10\n\nLEVEL DESIGN: The level design is great, I'll have you exploring every inch of the map to find different item or cassette tapes. But sadly after finding everything there is no reason to go back from more or even play it again.\n\n\nLEVEL DESIGN: 6/10\n\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS: Even though I prasied it so far, why don't I recommend it? Besauce sadly It's just a tech demo. I paid $4.99 and I still felt ripped off, it has good gameplay, level disign, and even a great story for a prologue.

It's all laid out in black and white, it is a prequel "MGSV: GZ gives core fans the opportunity to get a taste of the world-class production’s unparalleled visual presentation and gameplay before the release of the main game." The only purpose of this was to give fans a preview of the FOX Engine and what TPP is going to be like. It's important to read up on a game you want before you go throwing your money around then ending up disappointed and wanting a refund. It's also not fair to give a game negative reviews just because you don't want to read up on it first. That's like ordering something you've never had in a restaurant without reading what's in it then sending it back because it has something you don't like when the whole time in the menu it says what's in it. There's nothing wrong with it, it just doesn't suit your taste, it's not the chef's fault, it's yours. Now the restaurant is going to get negative reviews because of you, it's going to fail and a lot of people are going to lose their jobs, the chef loses confidence in their cooking skills and quits their passion for cooking and ends up working a dead end job they hate, struggling to get by, ends up filing for bankruptcy, gets a divorce, eventually turns to drugs and their children are going to have to grow up in foster care, given away to some abusive people who only want them for tax purposes, they're going to grow up turning to drugs and crime, and the cycle will continue all because you didn't want to read a few lines of text.

The port is also outstanding. Maxed out i got a solid 60 without ever getting a single drop. There isnt many things that are bad about this game. Some Minor bugs there and there but nothing major.

A bunch of them hold a special place in my heart. This one unfortunately does not. I really wanted to like this game, and don't get me wrong, this is a great prequel to Phantom Pain. I really enjoyed playing this game. But then I realized the whole game was one mission. Once you finish the mission, game over. Considering I spent 7.99 on this game on sale, I expected a bit more than 2 hours worth of gameplay for 8 dollars. Yes there are side missions. Yes there are optional objectives and things to find. But 8 dollars for a game with the main story that takes about 2 hours to finish... It is disgusting. Konami really screwed up by releasing this game and actually charging money and not just including it in Phantom Pain or made it free. Watch this game on youtube or something don't buy it.","December 7, 2015","false","3.1"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/perfectscarlet/recommended/311340/","perfectscarlet","PerfectScarlet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/perfectscarlet/","127 products in account","First of all, I would like to slap anyone who says that this game can be completed under 2 hours. I have 22 hours at the moment and still at the 21% of completion ratio because I am lewd autist.\n\nNow let's check'n'compare this game with previous Metal Gear games:\n\nWe got one big(not really big, but big enough, yep) location. We will roam it in every mission, the only thing that changes is weather, day\night, placement of guards, their field of vision, placement of cars\trucks and items. Whole concept kinda reminds of hitman games: you got big locations, you got NPCs with certain algorithms, you task is learn these algorithms and make your way through them to your target. There are events that will happen without of intervention of players, but certain small things are requing you to do something - for example, certain NPC's won't appear until you will reach certain point of area. Maybe it was designed like that for some reason, maybe it's an engine limitations.\n\nNow, AI. It's fine. Sometimes soldiers can be dumb, sometimes they can do something clever. Unlike Peace Walker ones, these guys can detect you much more easily, which is good. Alert system is same derp as it was in PW - combat mode enables not when soldier calls to HQ, but when he screams "CONTACT!!1". They can only call reinforcements through HQ, alert by itself is almost instant. At least this system effectively punishes player for being spotted, unlike old games where skilled player can take down guard before he will be able call to HQ.\n\nAnother innovation is a helicopter that you can call through your iDroid or by throwing flare grenade. There are few landing spots, two of them located outside of military base and the other two are inside of it. Two zones inside are good for quick evacuation, but of course landing there will trigger an alert(it's kinda cool how it's triggered towards chopper, you still can be undetected lol), soldiers will try to take down chopper with RPGs and Anti-Air Emplacements(which you can destroy before calling the helicopter). If you are entered alert mode, helicopter will be detected even from "safe" landing spots. You can extract prisoners\soldiers and yourslef through helicopter(another option is leaving a base through "end of the mission zones). Basically this helicopter replaces Fulton Recovery system from Peace Walker and recalls a truck from Portable Ops. Too bad that Fulton will return in Phantom Pain.\n\nCQC got better compared to Peace Walker - CQC chain isn't that OP as before and there is no OP roll from previous titles(it had long range and knocked down enemies, you could even stun them like that lol). Also now you can just mash R2 button and watch how Snake wrecks poor soldier. You still can grab from both back and front, which is bad, it makes grabs too easy.\n\nThe most weird addition to gameplay is sprint - you can dash by pressing L3, which also makes more noise. BUT. Dash is endless. There is no stamina bar, you can run like that till end of times. Also you can dash when carrying someone and dash animation goes through carryed person. They must fix it by making dash limited and remove dash ability when carrying someone.\n\nHealth regen is another bad addition to the game - it would be much more fun to search for rations and medical supplies than just hiding in the corner and waiting until ketchup will dissapear from your screen. At least it doesn't makes you invisible as it was in demonstration of the game long time ago. Also you can be critically injured, it makes screen blurry and colors it in red tint and you can hear sound from previous MG games that indicates that you are low on health. In this state you can be oneshoted by anything and it won't go off until you will heal yourself through using spray, which healing animation takes a while. This crititcal state balances health regen a bit.\n\nNow lets talk about our equipment. We got iDroid device that allows to listen to the cassete tapes which contains dialogues, important information, or just some music. Also you can watch map and set marks in it. Second we have binoculars, that are allowing to zoom picture and look around. It also allows to listen to the guard's dialogues or another sounds from certain place. Our starting gear is rifle with flashlight silencer and OP tranq pistol with silencer, I hate that thing since MGS3, at least it had bad accuracy because of laser sight in MGS2 and was rare as hell in Portable Ops. There are few weapons that you can pick up from soldiers or from certain places, such as rocket launcher and sniper rifle(thanks god that this one not equipped with silencer and tranq rounds). You also have empty magazine to throw them in the guard's head distract enemies, few types of greandes, knife(which is usable only in grab) and NV goggles. Where are the cigars? C'mon Hideo.\n\nGraphics are fine. Facial animation is very good. PC version optimization is godlike.\n\nWorth buying.","January 2, 2015","true","32.2"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","12","22","0","4"

Maxed out it only uses maybe 80% of my gpu, but framerates stay in the 50s. The only way I seemed to be able to keep acceptably smooth framerate was putting everything on high, but even then I'd get weird stutters for seemingly no reason. Don't get me wrong, it runs fine, but seeing how good it looks no way would I drop the settings down too low. I'm gaming in 1440p, but other games that look just as good can keep a solid 60fps while having all the same effects...maybe a slight bit better. One of those being Battlefield 4.\n\nThat said, after an AMD driver update and maybe a price drop, I'd recommend this for the $10 I got this at GreenManGaming. It's a demo, mainly meant for you to see what Fox Engine can do. Hopefully the lighting is unleased in Phantom Pain so we can see some really photorealistic stuff. Let Nvidia pay them a few million and foot the bill since they'd be selling more graphics cards as a result. I want one good reason to buy another gpu to Crossfire before AMD and Nvidia start dropping down to smaller nodes and I'm basically in a position to get a whole new pc instead of upgrading. Had this had the original Fox Engine lighting from the original reveal trailers this would be it. And if your asking if I would upgrade to another gpu just to play a demo, yes I would. Especially if it would be indicating a new-gen that consoles can't compete with for another few years with a game that had been a PlayStation exclusive for quite a long time.\n\nThe game is short. Really short, so like I said, I know pc gamers buy short little experimental india game like 30 flights of Loving, but this one is more costly. If this is seriously a factor in your purchase decision, then stay away. I'd also advise Konami to halve the price to sell more copies on impulse and help curb piracy.","December 18, 2014","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just a heads up, this is a pretty early review. !\n\nI'm really impressed with Ground Zeroes and it's actually making me excited for The Phantom Pain. This is my first MGS since the second one on PS2, so I'm pretty rusty with the style of MGS games.\n\nPerformace wise everything is on high, but I have lighting at Extra High. It has run pretty dang smooth with very minimal FPS drop on my GTX 760. It does cap itself at 60 FPS though and I highly recommend vsync to be turned on. I turned it off because I don't like vsync, but you will definitely want it on. The screen tears are bad and possibly even worse than Titanfall's screen tears. This is, however, only been done in the beginning of the game where it's raining and it's at night. I don't think the daytime lighting will have any impact at all, but I've only tried one section of the game.\n\nAgain, I'm really impressed. I was actually expecting a pretty bad port, but wow... The performance optimization of this game has really surprised me. It does have it's fair share of issues (Like the controller crash, where if you have your controller plugged in at startup it crashes the game), but overall it's pretty solid. It's cheaper than what it was on consoles, so I jumped onto it when I had the chance.","December 18, 2014","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think I spend 20 minutes just listening to the lore/audio logs and taking my time, with an overall completion of just under 2 hours.\n\nThis might actually be the first game i'll try and 100% complete.  Only at 8% currently, so much to do!\n\nI've been a fan of the Metal Gear games for many years and was hoping that with the several terrible PC ports/releases this year, that Metal Gear would not fall into the same boat and happily it does not, the FOX engine seems really well optimized for PC.  Hell, it runs so well I might even be persuaded to pre-purchase Phantom Pain, something i've not done since the whole Colonial Marines debacle.\n\nIt's good to get back to a Metal Gear style game, I've missed the action sneaking for a while now, there's others like Splinter Cell but I don't know, Metal Gear always seems to have it's own charm that nothing can match.\n\nIn closing I'd recommend this to any Metal Gear fan, especially for it's current price.  Of course it's not a full game but it's not a paid demo either, there's plenty to do and yes maybe if you rush it and spoil it for yourself you can complete it in 20 minutes but that really isn't the point of this whole thing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mercstream/recommended/311340/","mercstream","[M]erc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mercstream/","476 products in account","So where to start with Ground Zeroes? I guess first off, I'm a fan of the MGS series as a whole, and that should certainly be a prerequisite for playing MGS:GZ. This would be a terrible starting (even though it's the first one released on PC) and is certainly not going to convince someone to love MGS if they weren't a fan before. But for those of us that enjoy the previous iterations, it's worth looking at.\n\nThe biggest caveat with this game though, is that it's crazy overpriced. You are basically paying $20 for a tech demo. I currently have 3.8 hours playtime, and that was more than enough time to complete the main mission and one of side missions, even though I took them very slowly and experimented with the mechanics rather than going for completion.\n\nMaybe even more of an issue than the price, is how repetitive it is. $20 for a preview game with 6 missions wouldn't be so bad if they weren't pretty much all the same. The missions are all the same map, with just different objectives like rescue prisoners or sneak in and eliminate a target. Completing the missions basically means sneaking into the same base 5 times (plus 1 forced loud mission) to complete tasks that aren't really that different from each other. And if you want to complete everything, you then have to do them all again on Hard difficulty. I realize that repetition isn't completely out of character for MGS (it took at minimum of 12 playthroughs of MGS4 to unlock everything I believe), but this is even more apparent in MGS:GZ because it only consists of one short missions.\n\nSo far I've been pretty negative, but I'm also recommending the game, so I should elaborate on that. First off, the FOX engine looks incredible, and the visual presentation in this game is outstanding. I also really enjoyed the gameplay, which takes some of the better facets of MGS4 and builds on them. The enemy AI is also really fun to interact with. Here's a good example the complexity it presents. I shot out a camera at one point rather than going around it. But as soon as I did, a guard was dispatched to check it out. I hid in the area to see what happened, and sure enough, a guard came over to look at the camera. Not wanting him to report it in and set off an alarm, I tranqed him. But as I was sneaking over to his unconscious body to hide it, headquarters called his radio for a status update, and then triggered an alarm when he didn't respond. From my experience, you really have to adapt to the AI and you take a risk when you eliminate someone.\n\nI play a lot of steath games (no kill, no alarm runs of DE:HR and Dishonored for example), and the stealth feels a little off here. Well, to be fair, it feels like MGS, but stealth games have evolved a bit since the last MGS release. Not to say that this is a bad thing, but it's just different. After playing more recent stealth games, I was surprised at the lack of safe hiding places like the vents in DE:HR. This isn't a negative, but it is a different design and keeps you on your feet a bit more.\n\nSo all in all, I really liked the presentation and gameplay, but the total package here feels a bit lacking. I'll still recommend it though because most importantly, it got me really excited for MGS5, which is really the point of it's release.\n\n\n*SPOILER*\nI'd be remiss if I didn't call out the bomb scene. The concept of it was fine (bomb hidden inside of a prisoner that's going to be rescued as a trap), but I really didn't like the presentation. It was overly gratuitous and rather unpleasant. The MGS franchise has always had a very skewed view on women and sexuality, but this scene crossed the line for me and I hope it isn't representative of what we'll see in MGS5.","January 20, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(TL;DR is included at the bottom of this review)\n\nRight off the bat, this game is short content wise and that may turn off certain people, but trust me the replayability of all 7 missions is amazing. Each mission differs with objectives, but not area as the whole game takes place in a Cuban military base, but the level design of said base is astonishing. Every time you replay any of the missions it feels as if another route or way to execute said missions is found, creating a sense of longevity to the game that is hard to find in games.\n\nThe main mission resorts around the finding and rescuing of two hostages and can easily be done in a speed run in 10 minutes. You might be saying at this time "10 MINUTES!?!?! That doesn't justify a £16.00 price tag!" But trust me, you won't me finishing the first mission within that time. Not even on your 2nd 3rd or 4th time. You'll start to quicky understand the many different ways of dealing with situations which the game throws at you. Suddenly you've spent 2-3 hours doing a mission that, if executed with extreme accuracy, can be done in under 10 minutes! This gives you a strong reason of replaying the main mission. Everytime you do, the game gives you a score. The highest score possible is a S-Rank which even I'm struggling to get 34.1 hours into the damn thing!\n\nThe other 4 missions, labled as 'Pseudo-Historical Recreations' are centered on all sorts of different objectives from eliminating 2 targets to protecting a very 'special' undercover agent whilst shooting from a hellicopter. The last 2 'Deja Vu' and 'Jamais Vu' are obtained when all 9 XOF Patches are found within the game, this also creates another reason to go back and play the game because the 2 missions are filled with cameos and nostalgic moments that are pretty awesome.\n\nYou really need to play the game just to get a feel of how amazing the game mechanics are. It feels responsive and fast, with everything just feeling so damn satisfying! Like I said, it really needs to be seen first hand just to be respected!\n\nWith all that being said, the port is absolutley amazing! Running at a smooth 60FPS on high graphics settings, the game looks beautiful! The required graphical settings for all PC games are there in detail. You can really tell that Konami finally know how to make an almost perfect PC port and I'm excited to see how well they do Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain!\n\nSo, for a TL;DR,\n\nPROS\n- Amazing port with all of the settings you'd expect for a PC game. One of the best ports out there!\n- Slick controls with amazing gameplay that is in a class of it's ow\n- The replayability is astonishing with endless ways to execute all 7 different missions\n- The graphics are absolutley breathtaking, running at 60FPS 1080P is incredible. And, if your rig can handle it, 4K with 60FPS. This game showcases what 'Next Gen' means!\n\nCONS\n- Some people may find the game somewhat short, with a lot more to be desired.\n\nFINAL VERDICT... 9.5/10\nThe great Kojima has made us PC player wait for this game, but the wait was worth every second! An absolutely brilliant port! Now we all have to patiently wait for MGS V: TPP, and I'm pretty sure that that's going to be three times as good as this!\n\nDo yourself a huge favour, BUY THIS GAME!","December 21, 2014","true","39.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Do you want to feel like a reconnaissance or special operative, who is solo missioning behind enemy lines? Then look no further! Play as Big Boss, the infamous villain of Metal Gear series that was once a hero but turned rogue because his country abandoned him. Play the time before David Hayter/Solid Snake took the field and became the legendary soldier that bested even Big Boss himself.\n\nThis is a prologue, reason why it is shorter compared to anything Kojima has ever put out, beside this fatal flaw then the game is a masterpiece of it's genre.

The gameplay is brilliant but the story tops the cake off the icing. Unfortunately, the story is put into "tapes" and "clues" to understand what is going on, diviating from casual gamers who just want to be in the middle of everything. A clear sign of how Metal Gear cuts away the long cutscenes that it had in all it's series because of the critical acclaim from critics that hates cutscenes so much but never took into account that the gameplay of all of Metal Gear excluding NES, was innovative and new at the time or even mind blowing if just giving it some serious thought. All I can say is, that I miss the old codec phone in method. I do hope the easy method of none codec will not cross over to Phantom Pain.\n\nBeside that, this game is a short reminder of what to come and it's a masterpiece that leaves you with a heavy cliffhanger that makes you want to break your keyboard because the main story takes around 1 hour and 30 minutes while doing plenty of stuff around the single map that exist out there.","March 25, 2015","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most console ports have been plagued with mouse smoothing (which can't be disabled in some cases) but right from the get-gp the mouse is precise and responsive, unfortunately there is no mouse support in the menus but meh, that's really a small nit pick.\n\nAnyone complaining that Ground Zeroes doesn't pack a lot of content is sorely mistaken. The main campaign takes at least an hour for skilled players to complete on normal difficulty (far more if you try to accomplish challenges and play on hard difficulty) plus there is a slew of side missions. All in all this "demo" as people call it can easily run you 30 to 40 hours of gameplay, which isn't too shabby for the price.\n\nEither way Ground Zeroes accomplishes what it sets out to do in the first place: It makes me want Metal Gear Solid 5 The Phantom Pain far more than I already did to begin with so hurry the **** up already Kojima!

Just a heads up, this is a pretty early review. !\n\nI'm really impressed with Ground Zeroes and it's actually making me excited for The Phantom Pain. This is my first MGS since the second one on PS2, so I'm pretty rusty with the style of MGS games.\n\nPerformace wise everything is on high, but I have lighting at Extra High. It has run pretty dang smooth with very minimal FPS drop on my GTX 760. It does cap itself at 60 FPS though and I highly recommend vsync to be turned on. I turned it off because I don't like vsync, but you will definitely want it on. The screen tears are bad and possibly even worse than Titanfall's screen tears. This is, however, only been done in the beginning of the game where it's raining and it's at night. I don't think the daytime lighting will have any impact at all, but I've only tried one section of the game.\n\nAgain, I'm really impressed. I was actually expecting a pretty bad port, but wow... The performance optimization of this game has really surprised me. It does have it's fair share of issues (Like the controller crash, where if you have your controller plugged in at startup it crashes the game), but overall it's pretty solid. It's cheaper than what it was on consoles, so I jumped onto it when I had the chance.","December 18, 2014","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Might as well start with this. Do you have to?\n\nWell you could wait until other Metal Gear games or Konami somehow reaches the PC, much like Capcom. Or you can start new and fresh with this short prequel of the upcoming blockbuster game of 2015 just to familiarize controls. That's also enough time to catch up on the story of the series so far if you really are into that.\n\nWhat you will find is "Next generation" refinement no other developer has ever done before. Somehow the game, no matter how hectic. No matter how complex the Ai pathing, protocol, and combat tactics. No matter how many explosions happen on screen and in the real time cinematic that uses the same models and environments that are featured in the actual gameplay. The game maintains the standard 60 frames per second that other "Next Generation" developers are ether unable or too lazy to do. All on a high performance computer with late last generation hardware, or what I would call a PS4.\nThis is only achieved by the lack of detailed environmental oscillation, or the fact that every strand of grass does not have to be shaded with its own individual defining shadow from said light source. Sadly real life is not under an intense lamp as a form of sunlight, and every open field does not have such lamps shining intense light that defines the artistic merit of such blades of grass things. That would be too many lamps, and think of those lamps as being powered by your computer hardware. That means this game has truly one light emitting source or the models themselves do not have their own individual light sources when light supposedly shines on them (oldschool lighting).\nOR somehow rendering has become so advanced that there is no need to render anything behind an object or off camera? You don’t actually see the object, it is to question of the object is actually there. But what if you heard a sound nearby in the environment? Usually the sound source is when you are nearby the actual model of that object? Usually the game slows down when there is such a sound source, as it is an active fully rendered model that has physical presence on the environmental plain even though it is unseen by the camera.\nWhat if the entire level was not pre-rendered and it only renders things actively when they are shown on the screen, your camera view? Is this the true power of mainstream “Next Generation”?\n\nNo other $20 game will offer you that.\n","March 26, 2015","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've been a fan of the Metal Gear series for 16 years now. I've seen and experiences the games change and evolve one by one. Either for better or for worse in some cases. In the case of Ground Zeroes, the series has evolved for the better and the best. I have over 30 hours played on my PS4 and I decided to rebuy it on my PC just to play through it and support its developers. In no way is this game a "demo" as many people say. Yes, it's short, but it was advertised as a prologue. It has the main mission along with side missions, two if them being fun extra ops missions. One feautures Snake and another features Raiden from Metal Gear Rising.\n\nGameplay. The shooting system is perfect for a stealth/shooter hybrid. You can go in stealthy or go in guns blazing. The stealth system has no percentage on the corner of your screen anymore. You just use your thinking about whether the enemy can spot you there, and judge it from there. No more hands helping you out. The only thing helping you out would be the reflex mode which can be turned off. Reflex mode is a new feature introduced in MGSV that slows down time so you can react and shoot a guard and either kill or tranqualize him before an alert is triggered.\n\nQuality. The quality is as MGS as it can get. Always superb as usual with the new story telling design Kojima is trying to push. The graphics are sharp and great which makes you want to just look around the environment and forget your objective.\n\nStory. It continues off from where peacewalker left us. I wont spoil it but it's a cliffhanger that will lead up to The Phantom Pain which should release on 2015.\n\nControls. I myself use my dualshock 4 to play on the PC so I'm not really sure how they are on KB/M. But I'm sure it's pretty challenging since the DS4 can barely use all the buttons to map the controls. But they did a job well done.\n\nFor a price of $13.49 this was a steal. The replayability to unlock all items, S rank the missions, and even unlock some secret costumes keeps an MGS fan going for that 100% on the bottom left. I give this game a 9/10 and would have to say it's one of the best games I have played this year and recommend it to every MGS fan and newcomer to the series.\n","December 20, 2014","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ground Zeroes serves as a narrative prologue, a tease at what sort of epic, stealth-oriented action we can expect from The Phantom Pain when it comes out later this year (September 1, if all goes well). Boy oh boy... well it's got me excited! Having NEVER played MGS, this was a very welcome introduction to the franchise. I couldn't quite follow the story (as expected), but, nonetheless, for what this game aims to do, MGS Ground Zeroes is a great game. The intense rescue missions and compelling cover based fire fights were intense and engaging. Landing a silent take down or a risky head shot from afar was oh, so satisfying. SNAKE IS A TOTAL BAD ♥♥♥! Visually, this game is absolutely gorgeous and greatly optimized for the PC, which was the icing on the cake. Some may argue that the game is far too short for it's initial asking price of $30 when it first launched and I'm inclined to agree. However, to my surprise, I found a decent amount of re-playability as there are multiple tactics and methods to be used and choices to be made while tackling a particular mission. Now that the game is a mere $10, do not hesitate.","March 26, 2015","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think I spend 20 minutes just listening to the lore/audio logs and taking my time, with an overall completion of just under 2 hours.\n\nThis might actually be the first game i'll try and 100% complete.  Only at 8% currently, so much to do!\n\nI've been a fan of the Metal Gear games for many years and was hoping that with the several terrible PC ports/releases this year, that Metal Gear would not fall into the same boat and happily it does not, the FOX engine seems really well optimized for PC.  Hell, it runs so well I might even be persuaded to pre-purchase Phantom Pain, something i've not done since the whole Colonial Marines debacle.\n\nIt's good to get back to a Metal Gear style game, I've missed the action sneaking for a while now, there's others like Splinter Cell but I don't know, Metal Gear always seems to have it's own charm that nothing can match.\n\nIn closing I'd recommend this to any Metal Gear fan, especially for it's current price.  Of course it's not a full game but it's not a paid demo either, there's plenty to do and yes maybe if you rush it and spoil it for yourself you can complete it in 20 minutes but that really isn't the point of this whole thing.

Ground Zeroes serves as a narrative prologue, a tease at what sort of epic, stealth-oriented action we can expect from The Phantom Pain when it comes out later this year (September 1, if all goes well). Boy oh boy... well it's got me excited! Having NEVER played MGS, this was a very welcome introduction to the franchise. I couldn't quite follow the story (as expected), but, nonetheless, for what this game aims to do, MGS Ground Zeroes is a great game. The intense rescue missions and compelling cover based fire fights were intense and engaging. Landing a silent take down or a risky head shot from afar was oh, so satisfying. SNAKE IS A TOTAL BAD ♥♥♥! Visually, this game is absolutely gorgeous and greatly optimized for the PC, which was the icing on the cake. Some may argue that the game is far too short for it's initial asking price of $30 when it first launched and I'm inclined to agree. However, to my surprise, I found a decent amount of re-playability as there are multiple tactics and methods to be used and choices to be made while tackling a particular mission. Now that the game is a mere $10, do not hesitate.","March 26, 2015","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Do you want to feel like a reconnaissance or special operative, who is solo missioning behind enemy lines? Then look no further! Play as Big Boss, the infamous villain of Metal Gear series that was once a hero but turned rogue because his country abandoned him. Play the time before David Hayter/Solid Snake took the field and became the legendary soldier that bested even Big Boss himself.\n\nThis is a prologue, reason why it is shorter compared to anything Kojima has ever put out, beside this fatal flaw then the game is a masterpiece of it's genre. It does its thing so greatly that it's leaving your heart throbbing, your mind numbing and you wanting to taste more of the Metal Gear series.\n\nI highly recommend this game if it's on sales and if you have played the Metal Gear series and understood the story. The gameplay is brilliant but the story tops the cake off the icing. Unfortunately, the story is put into "tapes" and "clues" to understand what is going on, diviating from casual gamers who just want to be in the middle of everything. A clear sign of how Metal Gear cuts away the long cutscenes that it had in all it's series because of the critical acclaim from critics that hates cutscenes so much but never took into account that the gameplay of all of Metal Gear excluding NES, was innovative and new at the time or even mind blowing if just giving it some serious thought. All I can say is, that I miss the old codec phone in method. I do hope the easy method of none codec will not cross over to Phantom Pain.\n\nBeside that, this game is a short reminder of what to come and it's a masterpiece that leaves you with a heavy cliffhanger that makes you want to break your keyboard because the main story takes around 1 hour and 30 minutes while doing plenty of stuff around the single map that exist out there.","March 25, 2015","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most console ports have been plagued with mouse smoothing (which can't be disabled in some cases) but right from the get-gp the mouse is precise and responsive, unfortunately there is no mouse support in the menus but meh, that's really a small nit pick.\n\nAnyone complaining that Ground Zeroes doesn't pack a lot of content is sorely mistaken. The main campaign takes at least an hour for skilled players to complete on normal difficulty (far more if you try to accomplish challenges and play on hard difficulty) plus there is a slew of side missions. All in all this "demo" as people call it can easily run you 30 to 40 hours of gameplay, which isn't too shabby for the price.\n\nEither way Ground Zeroes accomplishes what it sets out to do in the first place: It makes me want Metal Gear Solid 5 The Phantom Pain far more than I already did to begin with so hurry the **** up already Kojima!

Metal Gear Solid is an action series that focuses on stealth, which means that instead of running around gunning everyone down, you are encouraged to sneak around enemies without getting caught (you can still gun down everyone if you're REALLY good). Ground Zeroes only contains a single stage, but there are multiple missions that can be played on said stage, increasing the replayability. As a MGS fan, I found the missions and the upgraded mechanics to be very engaging, and ended up playing this over and over as if it were an arcadie indie game. One downer was that I had to unlock the HARD difficulty, which is what I would rather have started with seeing as NORMAL is ridiculously easy, but I'm just nitpicking at this point.

Graphics are optimised brilliantly. My rig is good by most standards, and default settings ran at a smooth 60.\nControls feel slightly wierd, but not game breakingly so. All game controls are sensibly mapped, such as C to crouch, control to walk, but P to play music in the iDroid? I can't press E or another left handed key to navigate the iDroid? It's such a minor inconvenience that it's barely worth mentioning.\nGameplay is short as most will have heard, but it's incredibly enjoyable, and quite replayable.

Might as well start with this. Do you have to?\n\nWell you could wait until other Metal Gear games or Konami somehow reaches the PC, much like Capcom. Or you can start new and fresh with this short prequel of the upcoming blockbuster game of 2015 just to familiarize controls. That's also enough time to catch up on the story of the series so far if you really are into that.\n\nWhat you will find is "Next generation" refinement no other developer has ever done before. Somehow the game, no matter how hectic. No matter how complex the Ai pathing, protocol, and combat tactics. No matter how many explosions happen on screen and in the real time cinematic that uses the same models and environments that are featured in the actual gameplay. The game maintains the standard 60 frames per second that other "Next Generation" developers are ether unable or too lazy to do. All on a high performance computer with late last generation hardware, or what I would call a PS4.\nThis is only achieved by the lack of detailed environmental oscillation, or the fact that every strand of grass does not have to be shaded with its own individual defining shadow from said light source. Sadly real life is not under an intense lamp as a form of sunlight, and every open field does not have such lamps shining intense light that defines the artistic merit of such blades of grass things. That would be too many lamps, and think of those lamps as being powered by your computer hardware. That means this game has truly one light emitting source or the models themselves do not have their own individual light sources when light supposedly shines on them (oldschool lighting).\nOR somehow rendering has become so advanced that there is no need to render anything behind an object or off camera? You don’t actually see the object, it is to question of the object is actually there. But what if you heard a sound nearby in the environment? Usually the sound source is when you are nearby the actual model of that object? Usually the game slows down when there is such a sound source, as it is an active fully rendered model that has physical presence on the environmental plain even though it is unseen by the camera.\nWhat if the entire level was not pre-rendered and it only renders things actively when they are shown on the screen, your camera view? Is this the true power of mainstream “Next Generation”?\n\nNo other $20 game will offer you that.\n","March 26, 2015","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've been a fan of the Metal Gear series for 16 years now. I've seen and experiences the games change and evolve one by one. Either for better or for worse in some cases. In the case of Ground Zeroes, the series has evolved for the better and the best. I have over 30 hours played on my PS4 and I decided to rebuy it on my PC just to play through it and support its developers. In no way is this game a "demo" as many people say. Yes, it's short, but it was advertised as a prologue. It has the main mission along with side missions, two if them being fun extra ops missions. One feautures Snake and another features Raiden from Metal Gear Rising.\n\nGameplay. The shooting system is perfect for a stealth/shooter hybrid. You can go in stealthy or go in guns blazing. The stealth system has no percentage on the corner of your screen anymore. You just use your thinking about whether the enemy can spot you there, and judge it from there. No more hands helping you out. The only thing helping you out would be the reflex mode which can be turned off. Reflex mode is a new feature introduced in MGSV that slows down time so you can react and shoot a guard and either kill or tranqualize him before an alert is triggered.\n\nQuality. The quality is as MGS as it can get. Always superb as usual with the new story telling design Kojima is trying to push. The graphics are sharp and great which makes you want to just look around the environment and forget your objective.\n\nStory. It continues off from where peacewalker left us. I wont spoil it but it's a cliffhanger that will lead up to The Phantom Pain which should release on 2015.\n\nControls. I myself use my dualshock 4 to play on the PC so I'm not really sure how they are on KB/M. But I'm sure it's pretty challenging since the DS4 can barely use all the buttons to map the controls. But they did a job well done.\n\nFor a price of $13.49 this was a steal. The replayability to unlock all items, S rank the missions, and even unlock some secret costumes keeps an MGS fan going for that 100% on the bottom left. I give this game a 9/10 and would have to say it's one of the best games I have played this year and recommend it to every MGS fan and newcomer to the series.\n","December 20, 2014","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(see last pragraph for technical assessment.\n\ndiscovering deeper darker stories within the main arc, such as a returning character (paz) whome we learn more of her infiltration from Peace Walker, as well as new characters in the story we can only assume have something to do with the formation of 'outer heaven' in the games Metal Gear 1 & Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake.\n\nthe story you play here is the events resulting in the first games from nintendo back in the 80's made by thee legend himself, Hideo Kojima, this man created inventive and engaging stories, and has never failed to immerse the player within the Metal Gear franchise as of 2015, i digress. those games are the beginning, and this game MGS:GZ is a prologue, a short story (compared to all the previous kojima games) with intense visuals and incredible direction of all actors (voice and motion.... ugh, including keifer... ugh.)\n\ni suggest you at least buy it on offer or legitimately cheap on a sale website, there are popular ones but i don't want to be the reason you may or may not recieve the steam key you purchase.\n\nwhen you step back and appreciate the story we've been given in Ground Zeroes it opens up all emotional banks, Kojima hits all the right spots in perfect ways, and it's hard not to say "BUY IT, IT'S A KOJIMA GAME, THAT'S  A SURE FIRE WAY OF KNOWING IT'S PERFECT, NOT BUYING IS SELFISH, IT'S TOTALLY WORTH IT". but i'm a lover of these games, i enjoy every story (even MGS2:SoL) and i'm never dissapointed with it.\n\n\nTECH STUFF\nwith my rig i can sifficiently run this game at maxed everything however adjusting the few-but-more-than-you'd-expect-graphic options to a viewing pleasant to you does improve the satisfaction of gameplay.\n\n500W PSU\nradeon7770\namd bulldozer 4100 (♥♥♥♥ processor, do not think for a second it's good)\n16gb ram\n64-bit windows 7\n\nwith this set up i have experienced graphical glitches, and a struggle for shadow rendering with high light sources.\n\nthis setup isn't high range, it's medium-low ish... so if you feel your system is on par with this one, you will defintely run this game, and the graphics can still feel extremely well done.... still looks better than a console....\n\nit works great with a mouse and keyboard, it's a lot more PC friendly than you'd expect from a long time console series, it also works more traditionally with a controller, i prefer mouse and keyboard for precision and reaction times.\n\nwithin the game there is an option to turn on/off at your pleasure, this option slows down time with an adrenaline type moment of quick reaction when an enemy spots you, this can be fun while making the game easier to manage for new players not versed in the metal gear approach when stealthing.....\n\ni've let a few friends try this and the first thing they do is go in guns blazing, which makes everything really hectic, after a bunch of tries, they began going in quietly, asking me which weapons are silent (newbies man, damn newbies).\nwhat i'm trying to say is this game is versitile and very approachable from a action arcade type way and a stealthy non violent way.\n\nYOU CAN INTERROGATE ENEMIES AGAIN\nsadly they don't have personalized lines, they just grunt with the text appearing for you to read, failing to read it is not a problem the chances are it was a location and has been placed on your map.\n\nMODS\nthis game is moddable for a few things, if mods are interesting and you remember MGS2 with the cinematic character swap, yeah, you can do that again.\n\ni suggest you wear headphones, or have a decent stereo system, the subtle sound differences are practically perfect, for the sneakers out there, i was crawling through a bush and i didn't hear footsteps. but i did hear a small sigh, it was small, i was heading to a trap... i may have been discovered if i didn't know the direction it came from, and you know how those subtle things can improve the game.\n\n11/10 - KOJIMA DID IT AGAIN\n\nPULLED MY HEART STRINGS, GOT ME IN MY FEELS, BROUGHT A NEW DIMENSION AND RELATION TO BIG BOSS' ULTIMATE FATE.\n\nTPP Sep. 2015","March 25, 2015","true","95.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
