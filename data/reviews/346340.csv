Gameplay is pretty straightforward : Kill or be killed. At the moment you can pick one of the two modes to play : Campaign and Endless.\n\nCampaign\n\nThere isnt much of a story in the campaign: your goal is to destroy Gran Vitreous, the mother shape that creates the ships that attack the galaxy. In order to find Gran Vitreous you need to find its coordinates so you go on an adventure to collect 3 segments from the meaniest ships created by Gran Vitreous .\nSo the campaign is separated into 4 zones and each one of them got a level range(0-30,30-60,60-95,95-125) . Though the level number seems to be high you wont need to reach the suggest level in order to complete the zone( I was able to finish the game as level 83) .\nEach zone contains a lot of arenas to fight in . The fun part is that each arena gets random "perks" like increased enemy,drop, player's damage and the likes but also you may encounter and specific arena perks like asteroid field, debris, gravity wells, solar flares . When comes to encountering enemies you may end up against a mothership, station or a boss monster( once you beat the zone boss,you can find it as an encounter in next zones) . Other bonuses you may find are infinite secondary or super ammo ... or why not ... disabled weapon systems! Every arena got only 1 way to be completed : kill everything, kill the "elite" , wait for the timer to finish the countdown, repair the ship.\nDepending on the arena you pick you will get an additional objective that you can try to complete for bonus experience.\nOverall a good RNG system that may frustrate you if you are down on your luck.\n\nRPG elements\n\nGame features 6 gear slots(main/secondary/super weapon, hull,shield and utility) and 3 skill trees(offensive,defensive and utility).  Hull and shield are simple , the higher the number the better .\nAt the time of the review there are 6 utilities, each one of them with their own pros and cons. During playing I tried only half of them but overall they enchant the gameplay and are able to save your ship quite often.\nSame goes for guns, not big variety of guns at the moment in my opinion but gonna be added some new weapons later on with updates.\nThe general stat for your weapons is damage/ damage per second  , the higher the better ... if you like the gun of course.\nDepending on the rarity of the gear you can get bonus stats : higher numbers mainly with some utility like bonus items/higher chance for better gear and the likes. You can upgrade your gear in the dock hub(aka before you go on adventure) with credits.\nSkill trees provide only passive bonuses and cost skill points and credits to unlock them. You can unlock higher ammo capacity, more lives at the start , higher chance to find items, get more experience, deal more dmg and so on.\n\nOverall  Campaign offers quite good content if you have only 10-15 minutes to play .\n\nEndless\n\nEndless mode is completly different compared to Campaign . In Endless you pick utility and then RNG picks your weapon and put you in an arena in which you have to survive for as much as you can . You can upgrade your weapons when the clock hits 0(its time-gated upgrade system) and upgrade your hull/shield/utility from collection dropped items.\nIn Endless you will encounter everything that you saw in Campaign apart from boss monsters(thats if you played Campaign first) . That includes both mobs and galaxy events(asteroids,debris and so on) The goal of endless mode is to survive as much as possible and compare your result with other players thanks to steam leaderboards .\n\nArt/Graphics\n\nThe graphics are simple but flashy ... at times WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too flashy ... so flashy that you may end up confused for a split second ... in which you got hit by an asteroid. But graphics are doing their job just fine.\n\nSound\n\nThe background sound of the game is fitting, it doesnt break immersion but the sound effects at times are bad. To be more precise : you can hear a boss to charge its gun ... that you just destroyed.\n\nNow I need to say that the first time you play you may encounter 2 crashes : once when you reach your first store on the galaxy map , and the 2nd crash is when you try to load the game after the 1st crash but after them I had no issues with the game\n\nOverall\nThe price tag is fair for the content that the game offers and its a steal if you are fan of the genre. The game is fun and offers enough genuine content and playtime to make the purchase worth it .","May 26, 2015","true","10.3"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

Twinstick shooter roguelite. Geometry Wars mashed with Rogue Legacy, with a dash of FTL.\n\n-Geometry Wars: You are a shape, shooting other shapes for points.\n-Rogue Legacy: There is an item progression and a skill progression. You retain these when you die, which allows you to push further.\n-FTL: The game is comprised of 4 sectors that you must progress through and defeat the boss at the end.\n\nBeing a roguelite there is also a healthy amount of randomization throughout. Each sector has dozens of levels. Each level is randomly generated with a subset of the enemy shapes, and various buffs and debuffs. For example, 50% smaller playfield, 200% Enemy health, 75% increased item rarity, and an ASTEROID FIELD. Beat one level and unlock paths to 2-5 others which are similarly randomized. The classic FTL conundrum of pushing forward to simply survive to see the final encounter, versus moving laterally for more loot/XP is in full effect here (though there is no pressure of an enemy fleet encroaching).\n\nThere are at least a half dozen primary weapons, probably as many secondary and super weapons, and likewise about as many items for the Utility slot, which have various effects like a repulsor field, 'phase shift' which grants a moment of invulnerability, or simple speed boosts. Rounding out the equippable items are hull and shield items, which aren't really as exciting. All these things have their own iLevels and stats. Your Level 15 Rare quality hull is probably better than the level 20 Common hull that just dropped.\n\nStandard roguelite stuff. But it works so, so well.\n\nFTL, Rogue Legacy, and Geometry Wars are heavyweights with devoted fanbases, and deservedly so. Gran Vitreous is the result of putting those games in a blender. It's $5 USD (!!!) and well worth it. After 6 hours I've just beat the first sector, and I want to do nothing more than dive back in right now.\n\nYou know if you're the type of player interested in this game. You really ought to check it out.","May 28, 2015","true","17.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

For $5 dollars, it's not a game that's going to blow your doors off, the visuals suffer from lack of design and there's some problems in seeing certain elements on the screen, and you can be put into some situations that can really screw you up in terms of levels versus enemies. It started slow for me, but as I began to play it more it started to grow on me, to the point where yeah, switching weapons and really taking advantage of what's available was fun. Reasonable title for the price in question.\n\n+:\nUsing item Variety is the strength of the game, to get yourself out of situations and in particular deal with the various issues at hat.\nOptional Objectives and level variety give you reasons to play differently and try something different. Mothership, repairing missions, and enhancers are pretty cool.\nRPG elements added in well with upgrade systems of various sorts. Makes you really feel like you're doing something to improve and take on the situations in question.\nEnemy Variety, despite have a good amount of rushing enemies, is there. Enemies that pull, shoot, rush, and have weird attack patterns exist, keeping things interesting.\nUtility usage being its own bar and rechargable keeps you really understanding of when to use it and not, especially with the blitz of enemies at you.\nMusic doesn't wear on me at all, I can keep listening to it despite there not being variety.\n-:\nEarly on, you'll get overwhelmed due to the level and lack of weapons you start off with. Can turn people off pretty quickly. Need a little patience.\nVisuals are sub-par, and in particular can be problematic with all that's happening on screen. No frame rate issues, but hard to tell where things are at times.\nEven with the variety that's present, even more weapon variety would have really put the game on an another level. Some updates could push the game into a need to get territory, even at its low cost.\nWeird sound drop when starting battles. Unsure why.\nGame plays a lot better with a keyboard and mouse. Controller with secondary weapons has awkward firing mechanisms.\nFor Gameplay and more First Impressions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vzSJo6vZyA","May 20, 2015","true","3.4"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","2"

There is alot of game here, as long as you are ok with the graphics (I personally love them, as someone who loves the indie retro style).\n\nEssentially, you fight your way through level-after-level of bullet hell, collecting stuff along the way in order to perma-upgrade your ship for future runs. It's as simple as that.\n\nPros:\n+Hours of fun for a too-small asking price\n+Great retro visuals and graphics - explosions and pickups are epic!\n+Controller support works really well for a great couch experience\n+All the upgrades are complex enough to keep me coming back, yet simple enough to dive into without too much trouble\n+Upgrades really make you feel more powerful - and they are quite diverse, which changes your playstyle substantially\n\nCons:\n-Definately only for those fond of bullet hell with retro-ish graphics\n\nTotally worth the five bucks.

This adds a lot of replayability in the form of a galaxy to progress through while you upgrade your ship, grind for new gear and aspire for geometric domination. The shop allows you to sell un-wanted loot, and a store that allows you to re-roll stats on gear that you wish to improve.\n\nThe game play is a well balanced set of enemies of various speeds and abilities, the zones are also randomized to include environmental factors such as asteroids, black holes, and debris fields but also adjust have randomized attributes modifiers to them such as item rarity, item count, enemy count, zone size, credit amount, enemy health, enemy damage, to name a few I can remember. This makes every zone a unique encounter as it impacts the way you fight each enemy type. Mix this with the different weapon types and it forces you to craft your own strategy as how to engage enemies in each zone.\n\nHaving played this on controller as well as Mouse/Keyboard I can say the developer has done a great job of making the gameplay work well no matter which you are using. My preference for this type of game is to use a controller, however I have played it using mouse/keyboard when my batteries died and I felt I did just as well.\n\nOverall Gran Vitreous is a blast, it looks great has a unique soundtrack and affords you a considerable amount of fun in each level.","May 29, 2015","true","8.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There is a carry-over loot and skills system, a "choose your own path" starmap with bosses at the end of each sector and you spend most of your time blowing seven kinds of bejeezus out of a bunch of neon shapes in bullet hell. The game starts off demoralisingly difficult, but after you get the hang of the controls and your ship starts to becomes increasingly deadly, everything falls into place. Be sure to give it at least half an hour before giving up (I nearly did). Despite the cons, its still a solid thumbs up for the price ($5).\n\nPros:\nGreat variety of missions and different random objectives keep things interesting. Frankly, there are a lot more things to do than I would thought.\nThe loot treadmill works well and its not always just a case of "damage +1". Different combinations of gear can lead to new strategies.\nDecent variety of enemy archetypes and behaviour patterns keep things frantic.\nRuns perfectly smoothly and I encountered no technical issues.\nCons:\nThere are almost too many controls for this frantic type of game. You have a primary weapon, two secondary weapons and a utility slot. There is also some weapon charge mechanic which I haven't bothered exploring at all. Combine this with the fact that its already a twin-stick shooter and you basically need another hand. Half the time when I wanted to use my utility slot I found myself pressing the change weapon button and screwing myself.\nThe granularity of the controls leaves a lot to be desired, at least with the gamepad. Trying to line up a shot on a single enemy is frustratingly difficult. Thankfully, that level of precision is not often required.\nProgrammer art in abundance. It was probably a one man team, but it still looks like most of the interface was drawn in MS Paint and the enemy designs are sub-standard.","May 8","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Harmless debris obscures enemies (in particular, enemy spawns) and generally makes it impossible to see what's going on.  This is a fundamental failing in a shooter.\n\nControls are less-than-ideal and there's zero options to customize em.  You have a switchable primary, secondary, charge shot, utility and super weapon.  Some weapons are 'aimed' and some lock - some need triggering - 10 fingers per hand required!!  SOME rationalization/customization would be welcome here too!\n\nLastly for now, it's also crashed a couple of times - game continues but controls stop working - maybe my multi-monitor setup or something but it's not ideal.\n\nSo right now I can't recommend it.  If the developer wants to address the 'visual confusion' and offer some control customisation it might be worth another peek but I suspect it's going to remain gimped by being 'too busy' in both looks, controls and weapon options...\n\nShame but that's how it is right now","November 30, 2015","false","4.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's very much in the Geometry Wars family... perhaps a bit too much, but with skill trees and lasting ship upgrades thrown into the mix, it's got enough going on to make it its own game.\n\nIt's fun to play, with good twin-stick controls and lots of variety in enemy type, complete with "boss battles" and differing objectives (I started one level only to be told my weapons weren't working, so I had to stay alive and dodge rather than fight). Secondary objectives add to the mix in each system, and environmental hazards are factored in as well.\n\nController support is outstanding with my Xbox 360 controller. Colored icons that look like buttons make things easy to navigate (always a nice touch). Everything is smooth and responsive. The only gripe I have control wise is that bombs and "super weapons" use a control scheme that's completely inpractical in a twin-stick shooter - you use your targeting controller to place them, while continuing to move about with your main controller, and then once releaced, you have to go back to shooting RIGHT EFFIN' NOW or you're dead.\n\nThere's a difficulty curve here, but death penalties are minimal, and it's pretty easy to pick up and play. The visuals are flat but functional - nothing special, but perfectly servicable. The game's main downfall is the sound - unimpressive effects and a flat-out boring soundtrack. If the dev could address THIS particular problem especially, I think this would be a pretty awesome game.\n\nAt only $4.99 US regular price, the game is well worth it. I got it for 40% off, and I can only say LUCKY! If you're into twin stick shooters and persistant upgrades, then it's worth a play... but turn off the music and play your own.\n\n(edited for a spelling mistake - hey Valve - where's the spellcheck?)","December 31, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gran Vitreous promises a mix of RPG-like grinding and arcade-like action, and delivers completely on it's promise. I recommend this to pretty much any kind of gamer there is.","September 15, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A strong RPG progression system that includes both equipment changes, skills, and even a form of crafting. The base game is a 2d space shooter, but all of its parts combine to make something you don't want to miss.\n\nPros\n+ A wide variety of weapons which all function differently.\n+ Several abilities to choose from in the form of a 'Utility' slot\n+ Many levels, all randomly generated\n+ A bonus system, also random, allowing you to challenge yourself\n+ A strong classic foundation (that of 2d space shooter)\n+ An involved development team\n+ A Path of Exile like Item crafting system. Allowing you to randomize stats and upgrade rarity on items you pick up\n+ A unique battle every new system you go in to\n+ A variety of enemies\n+ Easy to pick up and just play 15 minutes when you don't have much time\n+ Easy to sit down and play 14 hours straight if aren't careful\n\nCons\n- I found a bug. Just one.\n- After a certain point (for me about 40 hours in) I began wishing for more challenge\n- Little real story, though this didn't bother me\n- No real manual that I could find\n- Controls took some searching\n\nTL;DR\nWell worth the asking price of $5. A spectacular little game that you can pour hours into.\n\n\nEDIT, 4/11/16:\nI still strongly recommend this game if you're a fan of RPG-based shooters. It seems, unfortunately, that the developer has stopped releasing new content though. I would've been thrilled if more content (even in the form of paid DLC's) was released, but no such luck. Do not let this put you off though, there's still a great deal of enjoyment to be gotten from this inexpensive top-down shooter.","July 31, 2015","true","65.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
