The only catch is people around them keep getting murdered and the wanna-be Mysteries Inc keep getting involved trying to find answers. As the band tries to focus on their studies, careers and relationships the looming threat to their lives and those of their friends distracts them every step of the way. Follow along through an adventure filled with drama but also light hearted fun and great music.\n\nThe main focus of the game is on the band called Impulse that consists of Chris, the main character and guitarist, Joe the drummer, Li the bassist and Laura the singer. On the night of their first real gig tragedy strikes, one of their own classmates and a fellow singer turns up dead at the venue.  What transpires next is an adventure reminiscent of Scooby-Doo as the band tries to solve the murder since they feel the police aren‚Äôt doing a good enough job. Unfortunately, more dead bodies follow making things more complicated, but that doesn‚Äôt stop their career as they book more and more gigs. Amidst the dead bodies and music the story does a good job of showcasing the four lead characters‚Äô personalities and their friendships and somehow even fits in a romance aspect for Chris. You have the option of pursuing Laura or Li romantically or just stay single if you‚Äôre not in the mood to date while a serial killer is on the loose.\n\nAnd that leads me to what my actual issue with the plot is, the conflicting murder mystery story and the story of the band. I won‚Äôt spoil anything story-wise but I will say Chris and his friends are horrible detectives which makes sense since they‚Äôre young and have no training. However, because of this it sort of drags down the mystery part of the game, they attempt to collect evidence and figure out who the killer is but what that actually translates to is breaking into crime scenes and then accusing people wildly of murder. The police in the game aren‚Äôt much better since, despite Impulse not being very bright they are still better at trying to find the murderer than the Seattle PD. What I really enjoyed about the game was the actual story of the band, their rise to fame and the drama surrounding them. Without the murder element this could very well have just been the only part of the game‚Äôs story and it would have worked perfectly. The characters are well done and strong enough to support a story just about them without the added shock value of murder.\n\nBut since murder is part of the story is also affects how the game plays. While most of the game is a standard visual novel you have to read through and click to progress the story with very few choice options that only deal with your relationship with Laura or Li, there are some investigative areas as well. You‚Äôll have to comb over crime scenes for evidence by clicking on things, that evidence is used later when you confront a suspect and what you found to backup your theories. The other unique part is when you‚Äôre with the band going over a situation you can choose certain comments to press further as you figure out new details of a case. All of these things are interesting twists but they don‚Äôt affect the story much. There is no penalty for a wrong choice when brainstorming with the band or confronting a suspect so you can keep making choices until you find the right one if need be so it can go from feeling like a detective to plain old multiple choice. You can‚Äôt fail or get a bad ending the game, the closest thing to that would be not pursuing Laura or Li as romantic options and ending up single.\n\nSince Impulse is about a band and music you would expect the game to deliver in the audio department and it does very well. The game has great background music fitting of the tone in the game but it is also fully voice acted as well. Only inner monologue and the voice of the killer in the beginning do not have audio, every character in the game has a voice actor no matter how minor. That adds up to a lot of lines! Overall all of it is done well, there are of course some weak points but I didn‚Äôt find the voice act as annoying as I expected I would. The game also has great artwork. The character models look good and fit their respective parties but there are also some great cutscenes as well. Some of the cutscenes feel a bit flat, though. Notably one where Chris and Laura are sitting on a couch playing video games, the art quality doesn‚Äôt match other scenes, like one where Laura is drinking wine on the same couch. However, the instances of good artwork outshine throughout the game\n\nI found Impulse to be a great visual novel experience. While I found the murder mystery aspect to be a bit weak, the overall story is strong enough to keep a player‚Äôs interest. There are great moments of subtlety in the game, writing that if paid close attention to helps round out the story itself even more. The game on Steam has trading cards as well as achievements that are not hard to collect as an added bonus. I had a few technical issues that had to do with the engine the game as made on, lack of autoplay for the text or any option to speed up or slow down the text and such, but the game was a lot of fun to play and in the end I over looked these things. This game has good story, good characters and lovely artwork, that‚Äôs enough to keep me happy when it comes to a visual novel so I do recommend adding this one to your library.\n\nThis review is exclusively written for Visual Novel Vortex, visit the official site here[vnvortex.co]!","April 10","true","13.3"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","0"

I'm not sure if this VN mimicking japanese detective anime cliches, but here you can find something like beach special, blue icecream and girls dressed Nana style. Aside from that this game also inclides point and click part where you look for the evidence and stuff.\n\n+Visuals are great, nice character design nice backgrounds, glad that nonjapanese devs moving in the right direction.\n+Full voice over - even the sidecharacters voiced\n+Ost - personally like it\n+Now with a steam cards\n-Sometimes visuals goes fullderp and that kills the detective atmosphere\n-Lack of save slots\n-Minor bugs, but since this is super early review i guess by the time you read it, they are fixed :)","April 9","true","17.6"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","21","26","2","0"

This constitutes randomly clicking words and objects until you figure out whatever obtuse line of reasoning the game wants you to pursue.\n\nThe UI is horrific. Buttons aren't lined up, there's huge amounts of white space, the text log is almost unreadable.\n\nThe voice acting is weak. Chris in particular is the worst offender, reacting to dead bodies with the same enthusiasm most people would give a stubbed toe.\n\nThe basic character art is okay but the CGs vary wildly between 'pretty good' to 'horrific non-Euclidean monstrosity'. (The CG where you play video games with Laura will haunt my nightmares for eternity.)\n\nThe music was forgettable. As in I don't remember a single track.\n\nBut worst of all, the story is completely nonsensical. Several plot points are raised only to be completely abandoned, the romance segments feel horribly tacked on, there's absolutely no concept of pacing, and the final plot twist has absolutely no buildup and basically means everything you did throughout the entire game was a waste of time. For the morbidly curious - it turns out that every murder in the game was committed by the protagonist's mother, a woman who is currently UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR TERMINAL SKIN CANCER.\n\nI burst into laughter when this happened. I was hoping this game would be decent enough, and I picked it up in an IndieGala sale for $4. Even that feels like a ripoff now, and if I'd paid its full asking price I'd be demanding a refund.\n\ntl;dr Do not buy this game. Especially not on impulse.

Its so much more than a visual novel, plays like a detective game. A plesant surprise from other VNs in which  it is just clicking to progress in a certain direction. The story... well.. could have ended better, but its still better than some things being churned out. Its evident a lot of work has been put into this indie VN game.","May 30","true","3.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And again, another reason for why Steam needs a somewhat better rating system then just a 'Thumbs Up' or 'Thumbs Down'. Some middle ground would be nice.\n\nNow, onto the review!\n\n'Impulse!'   is a slice of life murder mystery visual novel centering around the band of the same name, you play as Chris, your average regular joe who happens to be part of a rock band consisting of three other characters with various personalities and differing traits. During a gig, a friend of Chris's is murdered and the police have no clue who it could be, so its up to the band members of 'Impulse!' to figure out the mystery!\n\nREVIEW This game has a very interesting premise, one that works well not just on paper but also comes through with its few shining moments during the game. However, those shining moments are few and far between and are instead poorly executed with decent to terrible voice acting, lackluster characters/poor writing and an absolutely absurd conclusion that made me want to bang my head against a wall several times until I forgot it. And then do the same thing again when I inevitably remembered it.\n\nSPOILERS:  It was the mother. The character who appeared maybe a few times during the story, and only really became a factor until the last 10 minutes. The link between her and the crimes? Prescribed pills she left at the scene of the first crime for absolutely no reason other than the plot needing to be resolved somehow. As predictable as Jack was, I would've been fine with him as the murderer. At least he wasn't thrown out of left field and didn't make me laugh my ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• off when it was revealed.\n\nWhen it comes to the voice acting, certain characters perform their lines just fine, but could've needed some direction. The worst offender on the list is easily the protagonist, Chris. The guy's reaction to the most horrible of situations is comparable to when you find out that you had a son that passed away but you never wanted him in the first place. It's that bad.\n\nOther than that, the characters weren't really interesting, the two main females are simply there to act as potentical romatnic routes for the story to end.\n\nOverall,  'Impulse!'  is a really interesting and sound concept on paper that was poorly executed in visual novel form, only get this in a bundle like I did or on a really big discount.\n","June 1","false","5.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
