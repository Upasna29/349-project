This means that you need to find a set number of pages from your daughter’s diary to complete the game.  Ultimately, that’s the basis of the game:  you either play as the father or mother in search of said daughter, who has gone missing from the seemingly empty asylum she was committed to which is now populated by shadow people/The Hat Man (BTW – the idea of shadow peeps is based loosely on fact and there are many documented cases, and even some decent movies, about people that have seen or had encounters with these so-called ‘Shadow People’).  Thankfully, you don’t just search for pages as you also need to find some other items to progress deeper into the asylum and defeat The Hat Man (who I guess is like the pimp of the shadow peeps) to get your daughter back.\n\nOne of the more unique attributes of this game (though it’s been done before) is that sound is utilized to pinpoint the location of pages/other items you need by means of whispery voices.  Also, the sound design of this game isn’t half bad for being a budget title, with some of the sound effects/ambient music being pretty creepy in my opinion.\n\nNow as promised, I must go back to my earlier comment about the voice acting.  Granted, this game is super short and can be beat in less than half an hour, so you may think that voice acting wouldn’t be too important in such a game…..but it kinda, sorta totally is.  Essentially, it’s hilarious.  No, seriously, I’m not joking.  I mean, it’s so stupendously bad that it’s good (I don’t know how that works; it defies the human intellect to comprehend how that can be) but it’s true.  I figure most people will laugh at it, though some may actually want to cry at how bad it is.  And for all those 100% achievement unlock Steamers out there – prepare thine selves!!  There is actually an achievement for listening to your daughter reading the pages of her diary as you collect them.  Sure, this game can fairly easily be ‘100%’d’ and the aforementioned achievement is easy enough to unlock, but don’t go joy-puking your faces off just yet as I seriously believe that listening to all of the pages may very well land you in an asylum. I personally just barely managed to keep my sanity intact while unlocking this achievement, so don’t say I didn’t warn you.\n\nThis game can be fun for like 2 hrs tops, but I wouldn’t recommend it at full price, even if it is a budget title. With decent voice acting, who knows, perhaps this game could have been terrifying.  As it is, it will likely be overlooked by most gamers, but it is somewhat interesting and good for a laugh….or cry, so give it a shot.\n","February 18, 2015","true","3.8"," 117 of 160 people (73%) found this review helpful 46 people found this review funny","73","117","160","46","0"

As you go and investigate her disappearance, you find no one in the asylum and you start looking for pages from your daughter's journal while being chased by a shadowy figure.\nUnlike most horror games of this nature, reading the notes and discovering what your daughter was living through is more interesting than simply looking at doodles and drawings of the monster. Unfortunately, the plot really goes nowhere and is disposable at best for the game.\n\nGRAPHICSAs far as Unity games go, this doesn't stand out from the crowd. The environments are polished and I didn't encounter a single bug, but the rooms all look the same and it becomes really hard to navigate the environment. The design of the titular villain and the shadow people isn't really scary, and once you see them the built-up scariness disappears.\n\nGAMEPLAYSimilarly to Slenderman: The Eight Pages, you must move through the environment looking for pages while avoiding being caught by the Hat Man. You will also need to find some objects to open new areas and further explore the asylum. The pages are really easy to find since they make a noise when you are near them, and the shadow people can be "defeated" by hitting'em with your flashlight "Alan Wake style".\n\nCHALLENGEThe game is really easy to beat, and the antagonist showed up rarely and was really slow and easy to avoid.\n\nSOUNDThe voice acting for both the father and mother is hilariously bad, and that alone is worth playing the game. There is only one piece of music, and is the relaxing one that plays at the radio. There are also some ambient noises, and luckily no screamers or loud jumpscares.\n\nREPLAYABILITYAfter having beaten the game, you can replay it to unlock the 11 achievements that require you to beat the game as fast as possible and find and listen to all the diary pages.\n\nThe game is creepy most of the times, but the boring level design, poorly developed ghosts and short length make the game feel more boring than it needed to be. However, I recommend this game for the voice acting and really cheap price to support the developers to create a better product.\n\nStory: 6\nGraphics: 7\nGameplay: 5\nChallenge: 3\nSound: 5\nReplayability: 4\n\nENJOYMENT: 6\nFRUSTRATION: 3\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","April 20, 2015","true","1.7"," 129 of 190 people (68%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","68","129","190","23","5"

But it so nicely summed up the game for me that I couldn’t help but appreciate that I was being handed a focus point for my review without even having to look for it.\n\nBut let’s step back for a moment because it’s not just the death screen important here, but how you arrive at it. After scurrying through a twisting, self replicating maze of stock textures and out of place items, you’re inevitably caught the titular Hat Man in all his floating jack-o-lantern glory. And what’s this? He’s opening his mouth and- oh, I guess that wasn’t supposed to happen.\n\nAnd just like that we’re transported to a perfectly flat, perfectly bland death screen featuring three buttons, each drawn with the same ugly font and taking up almost the entire screen. I realize it’s a screen that didn’t need to have much detail, but what’s here is such a pitiful excuse for a menu I couldn’t help but laugh at it.\n\nI suppose I can give The Hat Man that much anyway; it made me laugh. First at the ridiculous voice acting that I want so much to believe was intentional. Then when turning around and laying eyes on what I think was supposed to be a terrifying demon but looked more like a blazing smile.\n\nAnd finally at the death screen, which I saw many times and eventually decided was a good enough place to give this game a rest. After all The Hat Man is just doing his job haunting this asylum, and doing it damn well at that, so I’ll just leave him be and go do literally anything else to try to forget this ever happened.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","April 29, 2015","false","1.0"," 59 of 78 people (76%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","76","59","78","14","2"

I feel like a 4.99 price tag would be more appropriate.\n\nThe voice acting is painful. I'm pretty forgiving of things like this, but wow. It actually made the game less scary because some of the comments were very out of place and sarcastic. When you're doing a horror game, the feeling needs to be raw with genuine fear. How are we supposed to be afraid if you aren't?\n\nI don't feel like I have enough time to sit and listen to the journal entries. Whenever I try to listen to or read one so I can learn about the story, hatman comes and kills me. I don't know if this is a glitch or normal, but I can't learn about the story if I get killed every time I'm reading the journal. I really wanna know what's going on with the lady's daughter but I still haven't much of a clue as to what's going on in the asylum.\n\nHere is what I liked:\n\nRunning around collecting pages/piecing together a story.\n\nSome folks feel like it's too bright, but I disagree. You can't have shadows without light.\n\nWhen the bad voice acting wasn't ruining my immersion, I was actually scared of the hatman and rushing through the asylum trying to find everything without dying. Though I wish he was a little less agressive so that I could have more time to explore and see the rooms/read journals.\n\nSo with all of this being said, I'm still trying to complete the game. These are just my opinions for right now and may likely change.\n","September 22, 2014","false","0.6"," 38 of 49 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","38","49","2","0"

One can argue that for the price any game is worth it, except The Slaughtering Grounds, but actually there's games that are pretty much similar or even better and they don't ask for a penny. With all due respect to the developers, this game is an attempt at being something and I can see it, but fails due to the large amount of bugs and many other problems. I'm really nit-picky so I will address a lot of things in this review that most people maybe don't have a problem with.\n\nWhen booting the game, I recognize the Unity launcher right away. Me and Unity games usually don't go well, but I can't judge a game by it's launcher obviously... Then the game boots up and a crazy amount of FPS makes me almost certain I'm going to have tearing issues, so I check Settings, only to find out that there's no option for VSync. I thought this was a standard in game options by now! Key bindings are pretty simple and I did try to change the inventory up and down bindings to my mouse wheel and it doesn't work so I'll just stick to the T and G keys, I had never done that, and it's terrible.\n\nFinally I choose Play, and I pick to play as the Father. Upon the first second of the game... there it is, the damn screen tearing all over the place. Quite hard to ignore but since most of the game is dark as hell, I give it a pass. So, I go upstairs, touch a book and the game has officially started. So the first complaint is, although I know a lot of people just skip it nowadays but, tutorials please. I had no idea what I should be doing and how should I progress, you can't expect me to rely on the internet to find out how to escape or kill a damn ghost that just clips through the wall and grabs you in the first SECONDS. Turns out I just needed to Zoom my lantern in her face and she dies.\n\nThen it seems I have to pickup... pages? Wait isn't this like that game where you're in the woods and... yes it is. You're pretty much lying if you say this game isn't a copy of Slender: The Eight Pages inside 4 walls because it clearly is. What it does differently is the fact that this is randomly generated, and it works well for the most part. You go right pass 3 rooms, and if you go back the map has changed. This is actually very interesting and an idea that I found to be wasted on a game like this.\n\nSo you do get the book and those pages, and finally enter this sort of asylum, this is where you seek the pages that your daughter wrote, as this is some sort of dream that you got to save her from. Upon collecting the fifth page, when the little 5 green balls are lit now on my HUD (which I had no idea what they were for like 2 hours), the almighty, spooky and fearsome enemy spawns. One of the main flaws in this game is the so called "Hat man", because he's just laughable, he just floats and follows you trying to catch you. Which he will never do since you can outrun him easily. Then he despawns somehow. This is the whole game, or pretty much all of it. Then again I do say, the lack of tutorials make this game so much harder than it is, no one actually gives you any tips on how to evade the Hatman or even progress in the game. The journal pages do give you tips but I don't feel it's enough for the player to actually understand what he has to do. Just to clarify, the little orbs in the HUD indicate that a new item to progress in the game has spawned and is now placed in the random rooms, so you need to find 5 pages for each new item to progress in the game.\n\nAnother complaint I have is, sound effects. You might ask, what sound effects? Exactly, there's barely any. When I die, playing as the father by the way, the sound of me getting caught is of a woman, what the hell. Also, the Hatman himself hardly makes any kind of noise, he doesn't even make a sound when he catches you...\n\nThe Hatman spawns are literally the only thing in this game that makes it hard and infuriating to say the least. And when you get cornered there's no way to go, making it such a cheap way to make you lose. Since there's a lack of manual saving, you're only allowed to save if you find certain save points, but these are hard to come by and you will lose a lot of progress. Also, the worst thing is when you've made good progress and the Hatman literally just clips through the damn floor and kills you. That made me rage-quit this game so badly I actually was about to give up on this, but I still got to the ending because I like self-torture, and achievements.\n\nThe atmosphere is... good! Despite the game being flawed to hell, having a not-creepy-at-all enemy that's just annoying and the lack of sound effects, the atmosphere does feel tense, and the feeling of not knowing where you should go because the game is randomly generated does give it a feeling of anxiety, since you never know what's on the next room, it could be the spooky scarecrow or the next exit. But please take note, a scary game doesn't need to have the brightness of the ocean depths. Don't rely so much in darkness to make your game scary. I hate games that are way too dark. I know horror has to be dark, but I like playing a game, not just hearing it.\n\nAs for my final thoughts... The Hat Man: Shadow Ward, is it worth your time? Sorry, it isn't. With this formula there's so many more like this, and they're probably better executed, probably free too. I always wonder if developers read these reviews and reading what I just wrote would leave me heartbroken, but I have to be honest, Hat man is a poor game and I cannot recommend it. 2/10","April 15","false","5.7"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","26","32","2","6"

Thought Process","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197980884019/","354 products in account","A solid, low-budget first-person survival horror closely linked to  Slenderman: The Eight Pages , housing a fair amount of haunting images and thick atmosphere, evoking a handful of steady cold shivers and durable tension within its short run, mostly due to the eerie and restrained sound design.\n\nYour daughter has gone missing from the asylum where she was being treated for attempting suicide. Once you enter the vacant facility, investigating her whereabouts, you begin looking for pages from your daughter's journal while being hunted by a dark presence wearing a hat.\n\nThe basic gameplay of finding a bunch of objects to unlock new areas for further exploration is quite easily comprehensible, yet it may be a fair disorienting challenge to obtain all 20+ pages since the randomly altering level design relocate the pages on each playthrough; though once you pinpoint the location of a page, whispery voices are in effect and narrowing it down become child's play.\n\nThe stiff level design is utterly mediocre at best and visually it is quite dull, but the ridiculously awkward voice-over is the shattering winner to listen to and hence should have been left out. Also, the poorly written dialogue comes out far more silly rather than intriguing, and finally - considering the source material that is based on real events - the outcome turns out quite immaterial.\n\nAt a discount however, coupled with appreciating solid scares, Game Mechanics' short piece of indie horror, regardless of being a Slender copy, earns a night's attention.\n\n5,5 / 10","August 5, 2015","true","6.1"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

I'd love to recommend it but in its current state I just can't. It has the potential to become a good, fun horror game. I could live with some of its flaws but some are just too major. First off: the voice acting. It's bad. Immersion breaking. Second, the map is basically a huge never ending maze of very similar, and the same rooms. But the biggest flaw, and the game breaking one. This could be a fun slender clone but the issue is that its just not scary. I only saw the monster once when I played and I was never scared of being killed. He's not fast enough, or dangerous enough, you barely see him. With some updates this could be a fun game, and easily worth the $5, but it just needs more difficulty and more scares.","April 17, 2015","false","1.1"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","17","24","0","0"

I feel positively about most aspects of this game. First of all, the price. This game is very affordable at the price of £0.79, although I picked this up in a sale (£0.19!), and it is worth it! I feel this game is quite underappreciated for what it is. The plot of the game itself is interesting, but yet not very unique. A mental asylum is quite common to see in horror games, however, copying ideas can result in a better game overall (the way I feel about this game). In no way at all will I compare this game with other horror survival games such as Outlast or Alien: Isolation, but it must be said, this game is genuinely scary, what you'd look for in a horror game.\n\nI feel the way this game's layout is set is great, for example, the beginning of this game has a few doors that I myself thought you'd be able to open, but cannot. This can result in disliking the game or liking it even more. For me, this tactic doesnt mean the map is too detailed, and I like that. Many times I've played games that have had too many places to go to, when in the end, all I had to do was go through the main door. Adding details like doors that canot be opened helps prevent wasting time, which is great, getting to the next point of the story without wasting time or lowering suspense.\n\nLike I covered previously, the main obvious plot is not too unique, which isn't necessarily a bad thing at all! Having a man chase you through a mental asylum is, of course, going to be a common theme. (Please note, the actual story to this game is rather unique, and the fact it's based off a real life story makes it all the more scarier!).\n\nThe controls are easy to use, the game is not too basic nor complicated, and there are plenty of them (and they're rather familiar with other games). Graphics, textures are all fine, and the flow of gameplay compliments it well.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this game. I appreciate games like these that are affordable, fun to play, not complicated and that give you a few hours of enjoyment. I'd strongly recommend this to people who enjoy horror games.","May 2","true","0.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

You play as the father(or mother, depending on which you pick) of a young girl who was sent to an Asylum. You receive a message telling you that your daughter is missing and you decide to go look for her in the Asylum. Upon entering her room and opening her diary the Asylum changes, the diary explodes and the first Shadow person appears. You are now compelled to gather all the pages of the dairy as the games gets progressively harder with each page. Overall, the game is pretty graphically outdated(it's an indie game with a limited budget), but they were able to get the spooks pretty well(the SFX were nice, too). The voice-acting is either purposely bad or just bad, so it kinda makes it hard to get scared when the voice-acting makes you wanna laugh. There are some bugs and the Shadow people are pretty slow and you get rid of them quite easily. One of the biggest issues was the fact that upon dying I was cast back to the beginning, hence I'd recommend a way of saving the game or just more checkpoints.

It's short, cheap, and bitter-sweet. In other words, it's alright.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe voiceovers for the journal entries were a bit dull to say the least, and even one of the entries completely didn't match up with the text, sounded like a different voice actor/cheaper microphone.\n\nOpening doors and equipping items is like pulling teeth. For doors, you have to be extremely close, and your clicks don't even register half the time. As with items, there's delays and its unresponsive sometimes.\n\nJumping is literally useless, and leaning is too slow and doesn't go far enough.\n\nThe Good:\n\nYou will probably ♥♥♥♥ bricks at least once in one of your encounters, luckily for you, I have the worst colon in the world, so that's impossible for me. I did jump at least once though.\n\nEerie environments and sounds.\n\nBad AI makes enemies unpredictably scary (Something kind of like Afraid of Monsters)\n\nThe Objective:\n\nYour goal is to get about 20 pages of your daughters journal, slowly uncovering the mystery of your missing daughter at an insane asylum, with the enemies getting more aggressive the more entries you pick up. You also need to find some key items to proceed throughout the game. You can save your game on TVs, unlike Slender. You must also avoid the shadowy figures chasing you down every now and then, or they will glue themselves to you and eat your face off faster than you can say "Game Over". After you get the 20 something pages and do a certain something, you've beaten the game.\n\nGame isn't too difficult, and it lasted me about an hour with about 4 deaths.\n\nSo if you're a fan of horror games (like Slender), you might want to give this game a try.","June 10, 2015","true","1.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The hallways even change during the same session if one walks away far enough so it really is random.\n\nDifficulty is quite tough and constant restarts actually reminds me of Receiver, a game that is not a horror game but has the same random map every time you play it and similar kind of (illusion) of choices - and both have quite tough difficulty that goes up slowly but surely.\n\nI have no idea what people mean when they say in some reviews that this game is a walk in the park - they must mean earlier versions as after some 3 hours i have managed to beat the game only once using save points. So many things CAN and WILL go wrong even after you think you have the mechanics figured out.\n\nFor me the concept just works. I have a lot of horror games in my library but not a nifty little horror game title like this.  This game will not blow your mind and redefine the horror genre but in my books it doesn't need to. It is enough to preferably bring a new element and solid gameplay and you have a game worth it's price and this the game is able to do.\n\nThis is not a large game like Penumbra series/Amnesia nor is it a design marvel of a game squeezed into a tight space such as Anna.\n\nCons? Few but there are some. Rough edges here and there are annoying. Clicking on items is best done by clicking franticaly it seems. Beginning of the game is also weakest. For example if the game is so well into randomized hallways then i'd prefer to skip the early pleasantries after awhile. Also ghosts coming trough the floor at you can be a problem when changing floors so stairs require your full attention. I was also killed for the first time before i even got the flashlight. Tiny details like these which dont matter at all after some hours but add to the rough feeling in the first 30minutes. i'd also not see the face of the Hat Man at all during death. Like games better that leave it to players own imagination what happens when you get caught.  (sound can also  be sometimes more effective than visuals)\n\n3 hours clocked at this time and will be expecting at least some hours more as i have not yet grown tired of the game. i'd say this is a good addition to the horror library.","April 17, 2015","true","4.0"," 17 of 30 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","17","30","3","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/291010/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nThe Hat Man: Shadow Ward is an indie "horror" game that adopts many game play features from Slenderman, but expands on them to bring you a some-what-suspenseful-page-collection-puzzle-game, and far more fair to you then Slenderman ever was.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  You play as either the father or mother searching for their daughter in an insane asylum, after stumbling across your daughters journal, the book is ripped asunder. You now need to puzzle your way through the labyrinth of the asylum and collect pages of your daughters journal and tools to help you progress to the next series of rooms.\nThe voice acting is pretty amusing, it's just the right combination of "expressive" and "emotionless", probably first-time-voice actors. If nothing else you need to play just enough to hear some of the ridicules things they say. "What the...? Now you have my attention"\n\nGame Play: As I've already eluded too, the game takes the "page collection" and "being chased by a noisy black figure" from the Slederman series. (I'll stick that in spoiler tags if you're really that sensitive)\nI haven't played very many horror games so I won't pretend to well versed in the art that is "scaring people", I do know that whenever I play a scary game my whole goal is to keep myself from expressing it. This game succeeded in keeping me in suspense and catching me by surprise a few times.\nPotential key game play feature spoiler: after you start the game by finding the journal, you need to puzzle you way through a sequence of rooms that will randomly change, however to unlock a new area, you need to use a specific item to progress, such as opening a special door, or moving an obstacle.\n\nAchievements: The achievements are fairly straightforward; finish the game fast (30 minutes is the fastest achievement), finish the game without saving, and then the rest are pretty simple or obvious repeat-to-get-this-achievement.\nUpdate: May 24, 2015. Ruh roh, it looks like three of the achievements are bugged, the counters for: Paranormally Active, Cheating Death, and A Good Book are broken and not adding up properly. This maybe fixed someday, but judging from the forums the achievements have been broken since at least May 1st 2015.\n\nPrice: The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is priced at $4.99, I was gifted my copy by one of the developers (thank you!), the price is pretty fair, considering the effort put into the game. However you probably won't put more than a couple hours into the game.\n\nConclusion: When it comes to Indie games, I tend to prefer to show support for up and budding game developers. This game might be a skip for most people, but it does have promise and takes a few steps in a different direction from the original inspiration.\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update May 24, 2015:\nUpdate about broken achievements within the game.","May 7, 2015","true","3.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luna_Nyx/recommended/291010/","Luna_Nyx","♥ Gia ♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luna_Nyx/","398 products in account","This game starts with a somewhat interesting concept. You can choose between a mother and a father, which so far, the only difference that it makes is that your death scream is different. You're trapped in some kind of demonic ward, or should I say, a shadow ward? This ward is always changing, so you have to keep moving forwards all the time. You gotta collect pages, too, like in Slenderman games, but way more, and a few other items along the way like matches and levers. You pretty much run between corridors, and now and then, you'll hear some kind of whispering, telling you that there is an item in a side room. If you miss an item and leave the room, just keep running, there is no point in going back, it probably changed already.\n\nThe main enemy of this game, is the Hat Man, a being that from a distance kinda looks like a trenchcoat wearing guy with a hat, surrounded in a cloud of blackness and with a purple aura. Later on, he changes to something different, that's way faster and more persistent, adding a bit of fear to the mix.\n\nThat being said, the problem with these procedually generated games is that, sometimes, it's way too random. And in this game's case, sometimes you're going to be able to finish the game in less than 30 minutes, sometimes it's going to take way longer than that. It took me around 30 minutes for a room I needed to spawn. I even believed my game was bugged.\n\nThe game's atmosphere is kinda creepy at first, being chased by this creature that never stops. (Actually, he does, when you enter a certain kind of room, like stairs or the room with the pit)\nIt's got some weak jumpscares, too, like a ceiling light falling, or a wheelchair moving. The problem is, after running from the Hat Man for a while, and after seeing the same rooms and the same jumpscares over and over again over the period of....dozens of minutes....It kinda starts to get old rather fast. It's quite a short game, and it doesn't offer much. It's really, really cheap, too. So, all in all, it feels stale, and it gets old rather fast, but I did find it fun for a short while. Maybe playing lots of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games myself kinda made me more tolerant to this kind of stuff, but, If it's on sale, why not? You could try it for yourself.","June 3","true","4.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

You play as the father or the mother of a girl who has gone missing in an insane asylum. You arrive in the asylum to go looking for her, but there is nobody in the asylum except for a ghostlike creature called the Hat Man. You spend the game running away from the Hat Man and meanwhile collecting two kinds of items:\n- diary pages written by your daughter, explaining a bit what's going on and what you need to do next\n- items that help you advance e.g. at the very start there is a barricaded door => you pick up a nearby axe and use it to remove the obstacle\n\nThe asylum's hallways and rooms are continuously generated at random. So I didn't really like the fact that you couldn't rely on your memory and orientation skills to find your way in the asylum. You just need to keep running until you come across the item you need to advance to the next part of the asylum.\n\nWhat I did like about 'The Hat Man: Shadow Ward' is that you get a short thrilling experience for nearly no money at all. When I finished the game, I was surprised to see I got the achievement for finishing the game in under half an hour. It seemed longer what with the running around through the endless hallways and what with reloading when caught by the Hat Man. But the game shouldn't have been any longer than it is, because it's too 'basic' to entertain for hours. Now, at the price of this game (and especially when on sale) I think it's certainly worth playing if you're into the horror-atmosphere type games and are willing to settle for a quick, cheap fix.","May 25","true","6.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You play as father/mother in search of your daughter wich was sent to an asylum because she attempted suicide. The asylum is haunted by shadows and The Hat Man.\nYou walk throught the asylum and search for pages. You might think this is another Slender clone, but no it's not! In this game the pages tell a story. I'd rather compare this game to Daylight.Both games take almost the same time to complete. Daylight had a bigger budget than this game bud it didn't acomplish at least half of what this game does. I sugest getting this game instead of Daylight (I tryed both and I regret getting Daylight).\n\nHere is a list of things that make this game great:\n-The Hat Man\nThe Hat Man is an original creature. I find it very cool.\n-fantastic atmsophere\n-builds tension\nThe game builds tension. As you walk through the hallways they become darker and darker(by darker I mean scarier). Sometimes they even give you the sensation of deja vu.\n-dynamic map(the map is different every time which adds replay value)\n-it has puzzle elements\n-it has good sound effects\n-it has achievements\n-you can play as 2 characters the father or the mother.\n-it has achievements\n-it's pretty short but who says games should take hours to finish? The game has replay value due to randomly generated map and playing as diffrent characters.\n\nIn conclusion  The Hat Man: Shadow Ward it's great if you like horror game.

I don't know how many you need to find because I never completed this game. If you stand still for too long near a page, shadow people will appear behind you.\nAlso the Hatman follows you slowly. I think the more pages you get the faster he gets but I'm not sure.\nAlso don't walk back to the spawn. I did that a couple times on accident. But you get trapped between a gap with spikes and the Hatman.

That's not the Hatman, it's not wearing a hat!" It didn't seem like much, so I just stared at it and then.....It ate my soul. This little kid with a black blanket over it's head continued to eat my soul for about 15 minutes until I figured out I had to collect pages for the journal lol. Once I figured that out, I moved on, searching the ward for more journal pages. The creepy atmosphere and sounds made me constantly do 360s with my flashlight thinking I was about to lose my soul the whole time.\n\nOverall, it's not a bad game.

Your daughter, who is currently in an insane asylum for whatever reason, is missing ! As a concerned parent you immediately rush to the rescue to find the asylum empty..empty ? No, not completely empty. There is a floating black blob of mass (I wish he would say "I AM HATMAN", alas he does not), which apparently wants your soul and I also encountered some sort of zombie once, who evaporated in the light of my flashlight (yes, you run around with a flashlight) and turned into the blobby mass.\nAnyways, you run around the place through corridors which all look the same and pick up diary pages to hear the exciting adventures of your insane daughter. You also get to pick up 5 or 6 items, which have a one time use, like a switch, a hammer or a crowbar. Progression will be made, you will take an elevator down and you will...look....for...more...pages...in the cellar..which also all looks the same over and over and over. I spent 10 minutes walking about, reaching 20 pages when I accidentally ran into the blob and died, making me go back to my save (you can save at tv sets..so far I have seen...one...and that was when I had 9 pages, so imagine...IMAGINE the joy of dying and collecting all those tempting pages again).\nIt also somehow feels as if a new page just spawns after you picked one up.. At least in the cellar I could swear you keep running around in circles, finding new pages every now and then in rooms you've already been in, but I am not certain...maybe I am just an idiot.\nEither way..If you enjoy collecting diary pages, running from a "Hat Man" and have a fondness for repetitive scenery and running in circles, you will most likely love this game. It is also quite cheap...in more than one way :p","December 3, 2015","false","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

After 5 minutes of waiting, I ultimately got bored and quit, as there was nothing else to do, and no other story to follow or objectives to complete.\nI guess there was this ghost blob thing too that was really upset by my presence, which is understandable as I had barged in without calling or knocking.

When you first start the game, you are greeted with a note saying that she has somehow "Gone Missing". When you exit the elevator, everything will look just fine except for the fact that it's completely devoid of life. But as soon you will find a cursed book which will cause everything to change. The once normal looking asylum will reveal it's true state, a rotting and decrepit mess. Grab your flashlight and start collecting 22 pages in a way similar to slenderman! This is based on true stories and sightings of the one that we call "The Hat Man". He, along with his shadow people will try and get you so they can take your soul. The game relies heavily on the sound and atmosphere, keeping you on your heels from the start, the only thing i can reccomend is if you see "The Hat Man" just run, run and don't look back. When your lights flicker, then your problem is just starting, friend. Get out as soon as possible. Whispers will tell you that there is a page nearby. The Hat Man and his lackeys aren't the only thing you have to worry about though, there are other ways to die too! There's an eastern egg featuring everyone who helped this game be realised, as well as the devs near the start (if you're interested).

The one thing I'd like to note is, that I have the exact same feeling of constant dread that I had when playing Alien: Isolation by Sega. Another Pro is that Story isnt THAT bad, and I'm usually more focused on story then anything else. Now, as the store page states, The Hat Man and Shadow People are based on Real Life Stories, Which is true and as something to do i decided to look up the actual Hat Man to compare to the Model the game has. While i couldnt find that great of a image i did compare the two and it does look accurate enough. Also, while Graphics arent state of the art CGI, Its not bad for a small company. Now for the Cons. The Voice Acting needs work but i do give them credit for even having voices. Some physics need work. The last thing i can think of is im not that sure of what is my goal in the game, like am i supposed to collect all the Pages of my daughters Journal without the Hat Man getting me like Slender or is it where i have to find a specific room or what? Anyways this is the end of the paragraph, The rest is the list of Pros and Cons.\n\n\nPROS:\n*Story\n*Graphics to a degree\n*Models\n*The Atmosphere with the Constant Dread\n\n\nCONS\n*Goal\n*Voice Acting\n*Physics to a Degree\n\nThank you for reading this Review and have a nice day","April 22, 2015","true","0.8"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","11","20","3","0"

I cannot complain for 19 cents.  The game is pretty bad though.  You'll hear the Hat Man in front of you and back into him when trying to escape.  It took me a while to get out of the first encounter.  It'll make you jump once or twice...  Maybe... lol  I I jumped twice, so I guess I got my 19 cents worth!  lol  :-)\n\nIt's a huge Ward with many rooms to explore, but they pretty much all look the same.  It's an insane asylum, so expect that same look a lot...  The atmosphere is creepy and the sound effects help the tension build.  The sound effects and voice overs are decent.\n\nThe graphics and lighting are good and set a spooky mood.  There's writing on the walls and blood on the floors.  Beds turned over and creepy black ooze in the tubs.  I haven't seen anything other than the Hat Man, so I am not sure there is anything else around to scare you.\n\nI really haven't played it long enough to give it a decent review, but it seems like a copy of Slender Man: The Arrival.  I actually like it a little better than Slender Man so far…  Slender Man just stands there.  At least this guy comes after you! lol :-)  Don't get me wrong, I didn't like Slender Man much either.\n\nIt is a fairly taxing game on the system specs.  I had to lower my graphic's settings down quite a bit for smooth gameplay.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/291010/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","You are either the father or mother (you get to choose) of a daughter who has been put into a mental ward for her own safety. The thing is something has happened there, and even though you were told to stay away you have decided to check up on your daughter. That's where things start getting even stranger. You leave the elevator and can't seem to find anyone around. You locate your daughter's room and find a journal with a strange looking face on it. Upon touching it you are transported into the Shadow Ward.\n\nThe journal's page scatter in a strange wind that pulls through the mental ward when you touch the journal. You will have to collect the pages if you are ever going to find out what has happened to your daughter, and perhaps find a way out of this situation for yourself. You see once you enter the Shadow Ward you will find that you are no longer alone.\n\nIn The Hat Man: Shadow Ward, you will find that there is a shadow being that goes by the name of the Hat Man. The Hat Man seems to be stalking the halls, and if he catches you you will be paralyze, your soul stolen, and if you wish to try your luck again, you will have to start from scratch.\n\nOn the outside this looks like a very scary game where there's going to be tons of jump out of your seat scares, and to be honest when the Hat Man catches you, most of the time it will make you jump out of your skin. The only problem is some of the mechanics. When I talk about mechanics I'm talking about several things in the game.\n\nThe first mechanic is the randomization of the game layout. I'm all for changing things up through each playthrough, but that being the case I feel like this game would have GREATLY benefited from a checkpoint system. The way I would have done it is that you have to collect the pages in groups of five. I do understand that this would probably screw up the random locations of the pages, but I think there is a level of frustration that starts to creep in, especially since the Hat Man's location could literally be in the wall in the room you start your adventure into the Shadow Ward.\n\nThe second mechanic is the inventory system, maybe it's my computer, but it took an act of God to change items that were currently equipped. Now thankfully you're going to be spending the majority of the time with the flashlight in hand, but it would have been nice if the game would have allowed a smoother transition between items.\n\nThe third mechanic surrounds the journal pages. Part of what makes this game creepy is what is written in the journal pages, and currently the only way to actually find out what are in the pages you picked up is to go into the journal. Why not just have the audio start to play upon picking up the page so that the player isn't taken out of the game to find out what is on the pages? Oh and if you have to go into the journal to find out what is written on them, the audio should probably match up to ALL entries. There's at least one case that I can think of off the top of my head where the page had something other than what was being said to me.\n\nThe thing is this game has that spookiness to it that will keep people on edge, but with just enough randomness to cause people to get frustrated. I know its a race against time as you try to stay 2 steps in front of the Hat Man as you try to recover all the journal pages, but when his location seems to be randomized, and the first playthrough I met my demise without ever really getting into the game, it kind of kills the want to play again.\n\nI'm going to be totally honest, I have yet to fully complete the game, but it isn't from a lack of trying. The only way that I've been able to get anywhere in this game is from constantly sprinting through the entire game, and listening for the whispers, that's when you know you are close to another journal page. I appreciate that there are items hidden in the game that cause you to have to really search the area, but without a map to refer to and the fact that you have to stay constantly on the run, there's a really good chance that a player could be doing a large loop over and over again not knowing what to do, scared that if they slow down and start to really investigate the Hat Man will appear, and you'll have to start all over again.\n\nSo here's the deal, this game has its moments, and I think it is possible, if all the stars align that this could be the experience that I think the developers are hoping the player gets, but with all the random variables, and the fact that the Hat Man can strike right off the bat, this game is too much of a game of chance to really enjoy. This game gets a 6.2 out of 10.","May 4, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To be honest this game, along with Slenderman, may be creepy but they are not really fun to play. You are not having fun playing the game simply because there is barely any gameplay. You just walk with your flashlight and pick up notes, that is all. No action, no puzzles, nothing.\n\nIf you prefer something like F.E.A.R, Condemn, or Alien Isolation, then I strongly advise you to stay away from this game. It is pretty boring to play.\n\nIf you like these types of game then this would be an 8/10\n\nIf you like horror games with some sort of action gameplay then this game is pretty much a 3/10..( You will be bored within the first 15 minutes of playing)","May 4, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It would be rather scary were the monsters not horrible looking (as in they seem like spoopy ghosts) and the protagonist wasn't constantly giving quippy remarks.\n\nJust under par voice work and one or two cheap thrills is all you'll really find here. Controls are tight, but the scares don't last for long, as the Hat Man is easily outrun (there's even an achievement for doing so 10 times) and the whole psycho ward loses its haunted vibe very quickly. The first few doors are unnerving to open, but after that everything just becomes an obstacle, blocking your escape from the monster(s) or your discovery of game-progressing items.","October 9, 2015","false","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Teirdalin/recommended/291010/","Teirdalin","Teirdalin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Teirdalin/","344 products in account","When I first began my adventure, into the world of The Hat Man, I wondered why steam was classifying it under s when it clearly started with T. Moving right along, I noticed from the settings menu at the beginning it was probably made in Unity; which gave me bad feels inside. Afterwards I started up the game with the highest settings possible, and the interface looked atrocious, the buttons were all comically oversized and didn't provide enough options; but I digress, I started up the game and was immediately greeted with a five nights at freddys lights sound clip playing on loop; this was to be the most scary event of my adventure.\n\nI left the elevator and went up some stairs, went into a room, wandered about it, left it as it wasn't very interesting, explored the rest of the area, went back in the elevator, contemplated suicide, went back into the room and found the silly looking book. The book exploded and I said: "Ok, now you have my attention, suddenly the funroom isn't looking very fun!" in a silly very non-serious voice, so I tried to leave and told myself that I haven't gotten everything yet. I didn't care, I'm not some OCD crackaddict who needs to collect everything, so I grab the flashlight on the table and try again; and to my horror I still have not collected everything. So I start cleaning up the pieces of garbage scattered on the floor thinking: "Hey, maybe I'm a janitor in this game" and suddenly I could leave. Oh also there was a black mage who tried to ambush me, but I slew him with my flashlight some how. So I wondered aimlessly for a while after killing a door with another silly dialogue, and admired all the five nights at freddys lights sound clip playing in every single light in the game.\n\nEventually I got really sick and tired of picking up papers and wandering empty corridors, but I perseveered because why not. So I saw this big guy with a hat floating towards me so I went over to talk to him and made a very girly scream as I stood there looking at him; please note, he did not attack me, but I had a heart attack or I got flung back in time to when I was in the fun house room. So I gathered the flashlight and the papers-\n\nBut then it happened.. The door. You have not collected everything.\n\nI gotten everything, but I couldn't leave, and the black mages kept spawning- until suddenly a black mage spawned who was immune to my flashlight, and then the game locked up, and steam locked up, and I couldn't alt+f4 out of it, and I couldn't minimize out of it, and I said "Good Game" and, since I have a second monitor; I simply closed out of it in task manager. It unfortunately murdered steam along with it and thus I had to relaunch steam just to post this review.\n\n\n\nI'll give it a 2/10; for the sake of black mages at the very start of the game. Next time use UFPS to manage your first person camera, and get some more original sound clips and make sure the game actually works.\nI have no idea why this game is even on steam; it's something which would be better off sold for free; I mean come on; Swamp Sim is more scary and entertaining than this.\n\n\nAnd now, now; I can predict what some of you may be saying; "It's only 19 cents, what do you expect from it?"\nJust because something is cheap, and you should expect it to suck; does not make it worthy of being considered a good game, or a game that could possibly be recommended.","July 11, 2015","false","0.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The atmosphere is great, I can feel that the hat man is chasing me, or some paper I need to collect is nearby. But somethings are kinda funny though. The narator of diary are the one. On some page they have set it too loud, on some page they are like speakin while have a flu, and on the other page i feel like they have changed the narator (different people speaking). The axe is also one time use, on the last strike, the door broke down and then the character just leaves the axe stucked to the door. Come on, you can make another way like the axe head got stucked, makes the handle useless then leave it behind. I feel like the character is so lazy that he leaves the axe behind. The gameplay is also gets boring fast. You have to look for missing paper while being chased by the hat man. Everytime the hat man got you, it will bring you back to the first room. The rest of the rooms are random generated, but after a while its get boring quickly. Will i recommend this game? Yes, while discount last. Its just a few cents right now.

Basically a worse Slender game with more pages, and a slight advantage when collecting them.\n~~~\nStory:\nYou can play as the mother or father of a girl, Virginia Berry, who was put in an insane asylum for attempting suicide. Virginia has gone missing, and you go a look for her. You pick up her journal, and it 'corrupts' you, and you must collect all 22 pages, and a few other items to save your daughter before the 'Shadow People' get you and capture your soul. As you collect the pages, it tells you a story of her reading the book about the HatMan after a woman told her to. She wasn't sure why, but she did.\n~~~\nA little Canton Insane Asylum background:\nCanton's Asylum is located in West Virginia in the United States. Congress has passes a bill creating the only 'Institution of Insane Indians' in the US. (So, I'm guess this family was Indian. [That's beside the point.]) It was opened in January 1903, this asylum was also sometimes called Hiawatha Insane Asylum. Many inmates put here were not mentally ill. The asylum closed in 1934. Atleast 121 died, and more than 350 patients were detained here.\nFlaws:\n-TV's were not invented until the 1927's. So I don't think that the TV's with static were a good placement for this time period.\n-I think if the developers did a little research on the place and time era, they could have made a better plot, giving an more intreaging story, and a better experience.\n~~~\nSound:\nThe sounds were hilarious for this game. The voice overs for the daughter, mother, and father, and the Hat Man. The Hat Man, when he takes you is the best noise in this game. (I'm kidding, it's also really bad.)\nTo be honest, I actually like the music from the music players. They are not too bad.\nThe pages make a whispering noise that is very obnoxious, and annoying. Maybe not to others, but to me, I did not like the noises for them.\n-If more time was put into the sound, it could have helped enchance the game play, and actually make this is a scary game.\n~~~\nChallenge:\nThis game really isn't challenging... wait. Why can't I pick up my axe again after I used it? Okay...\n~~~\nI wouldn't recommend this game. The play time is short, and not very interesting to me. I would not replay it after I beat it, which I won't beat.\n-I haven't finished the game. I've given up trying to figure out this hell hole.\nRates:\nStory: 4\nChallenge: 3\nSound: 4\nReplayability: 1\nEnjoyment: 4\nFrustration: 3","June 22, 2015","false","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think the game should save everytime you find a page, but alas you cannot save your game until you find a TV (I read) so everytime the shadow people or hat man get you, and trust me, THEY WILL GET YOU, you have to start all over! Whether flashlight is on or off they can still find you and hiding is a recipe for disaster, only thing you can do is hope to outrun them and even then if they are too close they can pass through a wall and still get you no matter how quickly you move. Good news is you CAN sprint! Uhm...great story so far. I have never played Slender yet, but I hear this game is a lot like that. You explore a Silent Hill-esque asylum looking for useful items and pages which are clues to the unfolding story. You can kill shadow people with the flashlight, but you CANNOT kill the Hat Man until end game.\n\n10/10 Scary Voices = Good\n10/10 Heavy Breathing = Good\n10/10 Heart Beats = Bad\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA shadow person (also known as a shadow figure, shadow being or black mass) is the perception of a patch of shadow as a living, humanoid figure, particularly as interpreted by believers in the paranormal or supernatural as the presence of a spirit or other entity. Many methamphetamine addicts report hallucinations of "shadow people", as a result of sleep deprivation.\n\nA number of religions, legends, and belief systems describe shadowy spiritual beings or supernatural entities such as shades of the underworld, and various shadowy creatures have long been a staple of folklore and ghost stories.\n\nAlthough participants in online discussion forums devoted to paranormal and supernatural topics describe them as menacing, other believers and paranormal authors do not agree whether shadow people are either evil, helpful, or neutral, and some even speculate that shadow people may be the extra-dimensional inhabitants of another universe. Some paranormal investigators and authors such as Chad Stambaugh claim to have recorded images of shadow people on video.\n\nSeveral physiological and psychological conditions can account for reported experiences of shadowy shapes seeming alive. A sleep paralysis sufferer may perceive a "shadowy or indistinct shape" approaching them when they awake paralysed, and become increasingly alarmed. A person experiencing heightened emotion, such as while walking alone on a dark night, may incorrectly perceive a patch of shadow as an attacker.\n\nMany methamphetamine addicts report the appearance of "shadow people" after prolonged periods of sleep deprivation. Psychiatrist Jack Potts suggests that methamphetamine usage adds a "conspiratorial component" to the sleep deprivation hallucinations. One interviewed subject said that "You don't see shadow dogs or shadow birds or shadow cars. You see shadow people. Standing in doorways, walking behind you, coming at you on the sidewalk. These hallucinations have been directly compared to the paranormal entities described in folklore.\n\nThe explanation we get from skeptics and mainstream science - and who are usually people who have never experienced the shadow people phenomenon - is that it is nothing more than the active human imagination. It's our minds playing tricks on us... our eyes seeing things in a fraction of a second that aren't really there - illusions...real shadows caused by passing auto headlights, or some similar explanation. And without a doubt, these explanations probably can account for some if not many experiences. The human eye and mind are easily fooled. But can they account for all cases?\n\nTo call these entities ghosts demands first a definition of what we mean by ghosts.But by almost any definition, shadow people are somewhat different than ghost phenomena. Whereas ghost apparitions are almost always a misty white, vapor-like or have a decidedly human form and appearance (very often with discernible "clothing"), shadow beings are much darker and more shadow-like. In general, although the shadow people often do have a human outline or shape, because they are dark, the details of their appearance is lacking. This is in contrast to many ghost sightings in which the witness can describe the ghost's facial features, style of clothing and other details. The one detail most often noted in some shadow being sightings are their glowing red eyes.\n\nThe dark countenance and malevolent feelings that are often reported in association with these creatures has led some researchers to speculate that they may be demonic in nature. If they are demons, we have to wonder what their purpose or intent is in letting themselves be seen in this manner. Is it merely to frighten?\n\nOne interesting idea suggests that shadow people are the shadows or essences of people who are having out-of-body experiences. According to Jerry Gross, an author, lecturer and teacher about astral travel, we all travel out of the body when we are asleep. Perhaps, this theory says, we are seeing the ephemeral astral bodies of these twilight travelers.\n\nPeople from our own future, another idea states, could have found the means to travel to the past - our time. However they are able to accomplish this incredible feat, perhaps in that state they appear to us merely as passing shadows as they observe the events of our timeline.\n\nEven mainstream science is fairly convinced that there are dimensions other than the three we inhabit. And if these other dimensions exist, who or what (if anything) inhabits them?\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI recommend this game for the experience, however, I will probably never finish it or play it largely based on the highly unfair mechanics. For example, every time I happen apon a certain part of the asylum where there is a large hole in the floor, the Hat Man always appears behind me and there is nowhere to run to. You can either jump to your death down into the hole or have your soul devoured by Hat Man. I consider that a gamebreaking bug. I hope the Dev will add places to hide from Hat Man, or create a device that can at least temporarily freeze him, something exhaustible so you can only use it so many times, or once and such items are randomly placed, but rare. I would like to see more variety of rooms or even randomized rooms as one poster in the forums suggested. The game can be expanded with a few doors that need unlocked and a key may be found. More props and assets to decor rooms and hallways. More gore! More scares and weird Lovecraftian notes to read which possibly shed light on the Shadow People phenomena similar to such info I pasted here from wikipedia. A few more checkpoints in the game. Maybe game saves, if not with each page pick up, but maybe with those special "key" items like matches, crowbar, etc. This game is amazing, but currently 'replayablity' is a huge issue since, well, basically you have no choice at present.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTL;DR: RUN!","November 14, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

It took me about 30 minutes the first time I beat it. In the beginning it may seems confusing, but after a while you'll get the hang of it. You are in some sort of hospital (I think) and the Hat Man is chasing you through it. The only thing you can do is to run, which is always a good thing in horror games, because you feel defenseless. The atmosphere is also really spooky. The hallways are really dark and your only source of light is your flashlight. Random noises make it even scarier.

It would be rather scary were the monsters not horrible looking (as in they seem like spoopy ghosts) and the protagonist wasn't constantly giving quippy remarks.\n\nJust under par voice work and one or two cheap thrills is all you'll really find here. Controls are tight, but the scares don't last for long, as the Hat Man is easily outrun (there's even an achievement for doing so 10 times) and the whole psycho ward loses its haunted vibe very quickly.

The straightforward design is accentuated by decent graphics and a very eerie atmosphere. Despite collecting (what seems like) hundreds of diary entries from your daughter, very little is actually revealed about the Hat Man, adding to his mysterious allure. The puzzles aren't exactly rocket-science, more of a "find-the-object-and-use-it-on-another-object" type of scenario. Nevertheless, this just adds emphasis on the fact that a creepy shadow fiend is chasing you and you can't spend time strolling around taking pictures and making mental notes of how good the wallpaper would look in your own house.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game, especially if it happens to be on sale. Simple, effective and the voice over is hilariously awkward.\nEnjoy!","May 10, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","0"

This is amazingly atmospheric and so engaging. I set the resolution to 1920x1080 and quality to Fantastic, turned out the lights and turned up my headphones. The graphics and audio are actually really good. The game has a dark, gritty feel to it so I'm guessing that's where all the bad quality reviews are coming from. The controls are wasd standard by default, but you can customize them to your liking. Movement felt pretty fluid with no lag. I became completely engrossed had more "wtf was that???" moments than I've had in quite awhile. When the HatMan ate my soul (on toast with jam?) and I turned on the lights to find out who put poo in my shorts, I was amazed that only 12 minutes had passed. I spent more time petting my cat to calm down than I did playing the game. No, I wouldn't pay 60 bucks for it, but I feel great about what I did pay.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nurgle523/recommended/291010/","Nurgle523","Nurgle523","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nurgle523/","541 products in account","This game isn't for everyone. But it IS based on a true story.\n\nIN FACT, my story. I know it sounds like bullgarbage but imagine seeing this without being able to move. It's certainly original by using a real life [disorder?] and expanding it to be a central enemy.\n\nNow, I honestly don't play it much out of the fact that I live and suffer this, it's not hallucination, it's waking up paralysed and seeing things. It's across all cultures though most call it Hat Man, Old Hag, or a demon sitting heavily on your chest. I've experienced these with terrifying reality, being that I wake up with a dream state and reality blurred together.\n\nWhy does this matter.. well it is based on far more than one true story, and takes it to another level. I will probably never play this game a whole lot for fear of triggering worse or other effects. [soon after, I started to wake up and "lag" with a rubberband effect. I woke up 17 times and I had to claw my way out of bed only to finally wake up.]\n\nI don't think they can capture the phenomenon and the absolute, crystalline horror. But they did a good job of expanding it into a "full story" and making it playable. From experience they perfectly captured the "inescapable shadow" [most common non-contact think one sees AFAIK.]\n\nBuy this game if you suffer from this and hopefully it will be theraputic but most of all buy this game if you want to feel and scratch the surface of a sublimely beautiful condition, that at it's heart, is truly a unique thing and 99% harmless to the average person.\n\nSeeing such horror in real life while waking [some while sleeping, but I suffer both sides, mostly waking.] is actually "cool" in my opinion. But the worst part is knowing it's not real, but seeing what you see and the feelings of not breathing and need to escape WILL show you that willpower will not save you.\n\nBut..\n\nI just fear one day I will wake up and it will be all too real.","June 17, 2015","true","2.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

So for the scare, that's... out of the question.\n\nThe storyline promised a lot. Suicidal daughter missing from her asylum, you, as the father or mother (don't know why the father sounds like the mother), decides to search for her. By touching her journal, you get... well, into another spooky asylum. Only armed with a flashlight, you're gonna lose your head: the asylum seems to change everytime. And what is that dark shadow with an hat?\n\nSlender mechanics: avoid the Hatman if you want to live. Still, he's wallhacking. He traps you in rooms (you're hidden but  no.... He's not even freaking moving away). He's suddenly on your side without warning.... still hearbeat and his "oooouuuuuuuu" are an indicator that he's near.\n\nAnyway, in other words, as it's randomly generated, the "finish the game under XX" achievements are pure luck. Right now, I'm stuck with machine handles. It's pretty boring to run away from a shadow, with random paths generated and asking yourself WHEN THAT ROOM I SUPPOSED I HAVE TO USE THE HANDLES WILL APPEAR!\n\nThe save system is "find the tv and click on it". Yay, so, it means I need the crowbar and the man is still behind me and...\n\nGraphics are correct though. But these translations? The French version seems to be done with worse than Google Translate.\n\nIn other words, unless you love bad games, avoid it. 7Days on the defunct Desura was better (yet, based on the same mechanics". Haunted Memories is better than that (at least, Slender in that was really getting out of your path when needed). I'm not sure if I'm going to finish it for achievements. Jeez, even Gone Home is scarier and there is no paranormal activity in that game! At least, for the price, you're not robbed. And as the game is frequently at -90%...\n\nI really wanted to give a chance to the game despite reading the reviews. Unfortunately, the game failed in the horror departement.","July 12, 2015","false","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The first few minutes it seems great, the creepy set up, the missing people, daughter vanishing. When you get ahold of that book and everything changes, up until the first scare even. It seems great. Then you start running into problems. The clunky inventory system where i can only equip items by pressing the correct number (especially having to take my whole hand off wasd to press 7-0), which would have been managable if the rest of the game worked. The main "boss" of the game is a poorly scripted bot who will go through the entire world to get to you. That along with the randomly generated rooms makes him a pest more then a consistent scare. The rooms being randomly generated makes you wonder aimlessly, which would add to the autmosphere. If it didn't also make finding these objects just as random. Which would all be fine on some level if the game wasn't broken. One cannot advanced past the need of a lever. You cannot lift up the lever either. It will say you have but it will not appear in your inventory. The final nail in the coffin of an already meh game to begin with.","September 30, 2015","false","1.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In the thirty-odd minutes that I've humoured this game thus far, that's easily the most inspired and "original" idea which I've encountered.  And between the complete lack of footstep sound effects, the ridiculously fast "walking" speed of your character (maybe YOU'RE a ghost, too?), and the highly uninspired graphics and sound design (though it does try...SOMETIMES), it's hard to recommend this to anyone bar the most hopelessly horror-addicted among us.  Maybe I'll bother to return to it again some day, maybe I won't.  I believe "meh" is a word favoured by the young'uns these days...\n\nVerdict: 6/10.\n\n(PS Did it really take THAT many "game designers" to make a game this ordinary?

Using a simple search-and-find-the-pages mechanic used in other very famous horror games, The Hat Man also adds the twist of having a changing maze inside the asylum so that one hallway isn't always the one you just came from. You're fleeing The Hat Man, a paranormal anomaly called a shadow person, who feeds upon the sick and weak. Did I mention he can teleport? He does that.\n\nA lot.\n\nGod I'm gonna steal that stupid hat and throw it down the hall and see if that'll distract him. I digress.\n\nThe game isn't difficult. Notes are shrouded in whispers so as you find yourself outside a room containing one, the whispers within your head becoming maddening (they might even drive you...insane? RIMSHOT.) Your foe moves slowly enough that you can out run him or you can hide if you find a perfect method of how to do it. Rooms are spacious that if you plan things, you can loop around to bypass the hovering spectre. That is, if you're quick about it. I didn't have so much luck with this. I ended up rushing into walls and getting caught just by that last second and ended up starting over. Sigh.\n\nAs this is a horror game, you're probably asking just how scary is it. Shadow people, as we know them, tend to be these looming types that are said to stand there and make you feel uncomfortable. The Hat Man is designed well enough that he gives you a you a nice shock when he teleports right into your face in a very literal way. One second you've left him five hallways away and POOF, there he is! You can also see him coming from a good distance off so you're feeling pretty free to give him the finger. He's not gruesome, but just unsettling enough that he reinforces the stories of shadow people being vague, smoky, and shadowy outlines of people who are unable to take proper forms. He's a bit menacing so that was good enough for me. Good enough for me to swear every time he tried to tickle me with those ugly hands.\n\nAs for the feel of the game, I mentioned it's a good hospital hell. You've got rotting bodies, the sound of people crisping against defibs (I jumped a foot), the traditional falling ceiling tiles, loud noises to freak you out as you turn corners, and the much appreciated radio playing assorted music. I loved the pieces that made me feel like it was a Twilight Zone episode. The radio is a nice touch. It's something a lot of games do, but not many use them so nicely as this, I believe.\n\nYou can play as the father or mother. This has no bearing on the story. Your child's sarcasm and dull humor as noted in the diary OBVIOUSLY comes from your commentary. You are a parent on a mission and somehow you even make some off-color comments at the start of this adventure. (Father calls the asylum a funhouse. Mother says homemaker turned homewrecker.) Upon reading the journal, even your daughter has found time to make off-color comments about her own situation. The apple has not fallen far from the tree. This amused me greatly. I didn't find it out of character at all. It seems like a perfect defense mechanism in a horrible time like that. (Referring to her attempts as a "been there, done that" light heartedly in group therapy which horrifies everyone who has never attempted? Yes as someone who has been there, I find this very funny.)\n\nOverall, the game is one that's simple in premise and offers gameplay that a majority can enjoy. However, I noticed a few things that did make my gameplay a little less enjoyable.\n\nUpon playing, the save function that was hinted to was not obvious to me. There was no button or indication of an autosave. Even after accomplishing a set of actions where the Hat Man was unable to get me (and I kept mercilessly taunting him until I got stuck in another maze ahaha don't do this.), there was no save function that appeared. Unfortunately, I'm a handicapped gamer and I do need breaks after hitting buttons for a while. I'm just confused if I'm missing something. I did search the forums and I wonder if only I'm missing it. This made the game entirely difficult for me and made me lose interest greatly.\n\nThe mother's subtitles have a few typos. I noticed. It didn't really kill the game for me but I spotted them.\n\nThe journal's audio seems a bit off. Is that audio that was placed there that we're not supposed to hear? That doesn't sound like the daughter's normal voice-over. Nothing game killing here, either.\n\nNotes for the handicapped gamers like myself: You're going to get tired while navigating. Pause frequently. Take breaks. I'm paused right now, matter of fact. There are flickering lights and flashes. If you are triggered by flashing lights at all, I would exercise extreme caution with this game. I would go as far to say this is not a good idea and play at your own risk.\n\nThe story is rather unique and I'm happy to see someone use shadow people as a source of horror fuel as they're one of the most common paranormal occurrences in the world. It's a little bare bones and maybe even cliched, but it does well enough. The world of the "limbo asylum" is rough yet rather beautiful. You're not getting AAA graphics because after all, it's an indie horror, but it's pretty enough to know that even if the world you're traversing in does repeat in a maze of horror, there was some time taken to make sure that everything looked properly decrepit and set out. Though large hospital rooms seem more for gameplay benefit rather than realism. You will be kissing the ground for those large rooms.\n\nThis game reaches a wide audience. There are those who like medical horror in their video games, those who enjoy the collect-and-boo type horror games, those who enjoy chase-type games, and those who are constantly in the need of challenging themselves to beat their time. Trust me. You'll want to tackle the achievements to beat Hat Boy in record time.","April 21, 2015","true","4.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

It just is not a great game.  It is an average game that I found boring.\n\nThe game is made in Unity.  You can play as either the father or the mother searching for their lost daughter in the insane asylum.  There are voice overs, and the acting is competent.   It isn't terrible, but it isn't outstanding.  Like everything in this game.\n\nAs mentioned, the game is in Unity.  The engine is smooth.  The graphics are not outstanding, but it animates well.  Moving your character is intuitive, although I found the movement a little awkward at times.  When there is something you can interact with a little hand will appear, and that is when you click.\n\nThe entire game, however, is just a search for pages of your daughters diary.  There are a few mild scares, and the setting in general tries to be unsettling.  Walking around a generic assylum that was dark looking for paper.... well, it just got boring.\n\nIf the game is on sale and you have some time to kill for a very average horror experience, pick it up.

This game started out as a Slender clone and has added so much more. Originally the pages were just there to be picked up. Now they tell a story. I think the problem some reviewers are having Is that they don't "read" the pages. The game definitely has a flow. If you play it like a FPS you will be disappointed.\n\nCould it be better? Yeah. But it is an indie title and a good one at that. This is a great game that you should definitely pick up when it goes on sale. It is worth the full price but only if you play it as it was intended. It is a lousy FPS but a great survival horror game.

MacMillan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Green__Tea/","56 products in account","Game: The Hat Man: Shadow Ward\nGenre: Survival horror\nDeveloper: Game Mechanics\nPublisher: Game Mechanics\nCopy supplied by developer\n\nThe Hat Man: Shadow Ward is a first-person survival horror game set in an asylum developed and published by Game Mechanics.\n\nSTORY\nYou play as either the father or mother of Virginia Berry, who disappeared from the asylum where she was being treated for attempting suicide. As you go and investigate her disappearance, you find no one in the asylum and you start looking for pages from your daughter's journal while being chased by a shadowy figure.\nUnlike most horror games of this nature, reading the notes and discovering what your daughter was living through is more interesting than simply looking at doodles and drawings of the monster. Unfortunately, the plot really goes nowhere and is disposable at best for the game.\n\nGRAPHICS\nAs far as Unity games go, this doesn't stand out from the crowd. The environments are polished and I didn't encountered many bugs, but the rooms all look the same and it becomes really hard to navigate the environment. The design of the titular villain and the shadow people isn't really scary, and once you see them the built-up scariness that never existed disappears.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nSimilarly to Slenderman: The Eight Pages, you must move through the environment looking for pages while avoiding being caught by the Hat Man. You will also need to find some objects to open new areas and further explore the asylum. The pages are really easy to find since they make a noise when you are near them, and the shadow people can be "defeated" by hitting'em with your flashlight "Alan Wake style" but much worse as it doesn't work half the time.\n\nCHALLENGE\nThe game is really easy to beat, and the antagonist showed up rarely and was really slow and easy to avoid.\n\nSOUND\nThe voice acting for both the father and mother is hilariously bad, and that alone is worth playing the game. There is only one piece of music, and is the relaxing one that plays at the radio. There are also some ambient noises, and luckily no screamers or loud jumpscares.\n\nREPLAYABILITY\nAfter having beaten the game, you can replay it to unlock the 11 achievements that require you to beat the game as fast as possible and find and listen to all the diary pages.\n\nThe game is creepy most of the times, but the boring level design, poorly developed ghosts and short length make the game feel more boring than it needed to be. However, I recommend this game for the voice acting and really cheap price to support the developers to create a better product.\n\nStory: 0.5\nGraphics: 0.1756\nGameplay: 0.2\nChallenge: 6 (because of broken mechanics)\nSound: 1\nReplayability: 0\n\nENJOYMENT: 3\nFRUSTRATION: 10\nOVERALL: 10/10 IGN","July 6, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The over all story isn't bad, it still needs a lot of work, but the main problems are this; its pretty much just another slenderman-styled game in terms of objective and enemies, the graphics are not that great, it is way too predictable, the hatman himself is a poor adversary and too slow, even in the updates, and he is not scary. In fact the hatman looks like a darker version of the Hatbox Ghost from Disney's Haunted Mansion. It would have been much wiser to replace the tophat with a fedora and made him look like the infamous shadow man seen throughout man decades by many people. I do not recomend getting this game unless it is given out for free or it is sold for at least $0.99. One would be better off buying a slenderman game and playing it for the slenderman would be far scarier and more panic inducing. Developers of this game, I appreciate the effort to bring in a new character to the horror game scene, but you just made remade the same game that we all have been playing for far too long.","October 26, 2014","false","0.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/291010/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","Well the dev added me and gave me this for free so I feel like I should be nice and give him a good review on this but I also want to be honest because this is one of the worst games I have played in a long time. Before I say anything else I can definitely say that I fully appreciate the time and talent of the people who make games, good or bad, because it isn't easy. To the game's credit it had no technical issues and controlled and performed very smoothly. There is no in-game vsync so I had to force it through Nvidia control panel, but no biggie. Unless I missed it, there is also no mouse sensitivity option so I had to lower it in my razer synapse but also no big deal. Although I am not a fan of adventure games I felt like I owed it to this guy to try his game and give it my honest opinion. The game lacks heavily in detail (basically none) and overall production value. The graphics are a major turn off. The game was very, very bland and very boring. The graphics look like pre Half-Life 1 and the environment is almost empty, only adorned with a few tables and a radio, a few beds in some rooms, sinks and toilets, a few things on the walls, and nothing else. It is very plain and mostly empty. I think the game repeats on itself, meaning there was no end as I moved in a direction through doors and hallways and the environment kept repeating. A piece of ceiling fell down with a scary music que eventually so I guess if you wander enough more things happen. Really though I'm not sure. Three times I encountered a black ghost (Bill Cosby from Ghost Dad I think) with a BOO! cartoon halloween style face and the game just popped up the dead menu, showing restart and quit. Nothing happened, just dead and menu screen. I do not know how the black figure is triggered, or why, or how to avoid him if I see him, or what the point of the game is or what exactly I am supposed to be doing, and overall don't care to see the answer to any of those inquiries. Note: I read that you just go around and collect journal pages and avoid the black figure and the game can be beat in like 30 minutes. That could have saved me a lot of words in my review.\n\nOut of 50+ installed games, this game just can't hold an audience with me anymore. 20 minutes was more than enough time spent on this. Although I dislike adventure games, I have played a few out there that are similarly priced (when on sale which is often if you know where to look) that are far superior in every aspect. Namely Outlast. Where this game would be a 3/10 Outlast would be a 8/10, easily trumping this game in every possible aspect.\n\nThis game is so depressingly void of any real substance in terms of graphics/visual content and gameplay that it is what truly makes it scary. Imagine the inside of a cardboard box with a few miniature doll house chairs and tables and beds set up in it and that is what this game looks like.\n\nThanks for the game.

Anybody can slap a horror atmosphere and put a slightly creepy character into the came, by the way, black doesn't mean scary and ghosts don't mean scary, the villain isn't good at all. Then I have to mention the placements of save points, that is, as far as I've played, you need to find the pages of journals, but it doesn't save after you find an entire journal, so if you put a good half hour into looking for most of the pages just to be caught by the hat man you are sent back to the book.

As far as being scary, this game does an okay job.  The feeling of vulnerability with no weapon and the ability to lose the game by getting "caught" is a little nerve-racking, but otherwise, this game isn't quite there.\n\nThe weapon you DO get is immediately used up.  You can't pick it up after you use it, which I find weird since it doesn't look hard to pick back up if it were real life.\n\nThe Journal Pages you need to collect don't add much to the spookiness of it, and are slightly broken.  You get some voice-over for the Journal pages, but some of the pages have text and voiceover that don't match, like the voice is for a completely different page, crushing the illusion.\n\nYou don't really know where to go and just hope you're going in the right direction.  No maps or anything.  This would be fine, but the scenery you get lost in is repetative, so it gets old after a while.\n\nClicking to open things seemed un-respsonsive.  "Click to Open" with a hand icon on the screen, but clicking doesn't do anything unless you click like nine times.\n\nWhen you first get the ability to scare away shadows, it's creepy and works well.  When you encounter the Hat Man, however, you get the impression that it's supposed to work, but ends up failing, making you move too slowly to get away.\n\nI DID like how it stops you if you "miss something".  The game actually says "You missed something" if you don't pick up a vital item, which I thought was a nifty touch.\n\nAnyway, like I said, not a loss at all for 19 cents, but that's where I'd draw the line.","April 28, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've played scarier games for free. I'm pretty sure this *isn't* the scariest game of 2014.\n\nThis *was* a fifteen dollar game that made Daylight look good. It's dropped to five and I suppose that's more reasonable than Daylight.\n\nThe game itself is an obvious Slender clone, where you're running around grabbing pages while avoiding the monster. Unlike slender, however, the monster doesn't ever teleport. No, he just follows you around endlessly, and phases through walls. So if you get cornered, you may as well die then because I waited five minutes staring at him while crouched with no movement, whatsoever. It would seem like a breath of fresh air, since you can obviously outrun but not hide from the Hat Man, unlike in recent horror games where hiding is key. In this, you're running around to get pages with no places to hide, much like slender.\n\nThe voice acting is pretty hilarious(ly bad), but the sound quality is alright. This really is just your average run-of-the-mill indie-horror game, with the same graphics, same UI, and same gameplay, except it's longer. Oh, and the layout of the hospital changes. It doesn't exactly randomize scares like Daylight, so there's not as much replay value (which implies loosely that there is some small replay value to Daylight, which is up to your interpretation)\n\nIf it were any shorter than it already is it wouldn't qualify for the price it has. If it were any longer, I'd be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and begging myself that this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game would be over.\n\nAll in all, it's a fun... half-hour, and I can say it was worth the 19 cents I paid for it. maybe even worth $1.50-2.00.\n\nI can recommend the game to you, but not at the price.

Avoid the fairly cheesy-looking villain as he chases you through walls (or gets stuck in a doorway, which I've seen happen twice now). Collect missing pages from a book. Try to figure out how in the hell to save your game. (There's apparently an option for it, but damn if I know how it works). Die, and start over again from the beginning. Turn off, and go do something else.\n\nI don't want to be overly cruel -- the devs did a good job with the sound effects, and were somewhat successful in inducing nervousness in the player through the "stalker" nature of the villain rather than through cheap jump scares. But the repetitiveness of the environment design and the lack of a reliable save feature eventually make the game too tedious to devote much time to. I might give this another shot someday, but for now it's going back on the shelf.\n\nUpdate: I've tried replaying this turd on and off again over the course of a year, and every time, I find it to be a tedious slog that depends more on procedurally-generated luck than actual skill.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nekobun/recommended/291010/","nekobun","nekobun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nekobun/","1568 products in account","The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is best described as "more okay than I expected." In a time where first-person horror games get dumped out left and right for a shot at YouTube viral status and a quick buck, I didn't expect more than a reskinned Slender-esque with a few cheap deaths. The Hat Man is still a re-skinned Slender-esque, but the reskin isn't too ugly, and the cheap deaths were mostly lacking.\n\nIn fact, the titular Hat Man is barely effective as a threat at all. He's so easy to hear and avoid that it's highly unlikely you'll run into him in a game-ending sense more than two or three times over the course of the entire game. The bulk of gameplay consists of scrounging around for journal pages and other items as you try to track down your daughter, who's disappeared from her room shortly before your arrival and a sudden turn of everything for the spooky.\n\nThe asylum that serves as the game's setting is fairly easy to navigate, but suffers from a lot of repetitive textures and room layouts, making getting lost a frequent concern. Eventually things shift to more of a basement, which suffers the same problem, and it's not difficult to miss some of the pages you need upon first pass. It's still not incredibly hard, but when you do have to backtrack despite thinking you've checked every possible room, it gets frustrating very quickly.\n\nAside from the daughter's journey, as spelled out in her journal, the reasons for what you're doing as her parent (you can choose mother or father at the start) are less clearly explained. Storytelling definitely falls short outside those journal bits, which are handily voice-acted so you don't have to read them yourself. Quick tip: Don't turn on the auto-reading of the entries, but listen manually each time, as the former seems not to pop the "listen to every entry" achievement.\n\nMy final verdict is that The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is mediocre at best. While I didn't hate it, I don't see why I'd suggest anyone else take it for a spin. At least it was really short.","January 8","false","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I mean it's not aweful for the girl, but the parent (Father as i played) it was pretty aweful and he didn't seem to be terrorfied that no one was at the asylum and he was being hunted by a creature made of shadow.\n\nThe story to it is quite interesting and made me want to keep playing just to find out what happened at this place and who this "Hat Man" was as well as why he was doing what he was doing. There is certainly potential in this and it's certainly not a aweful game by any stretch of the imagination. For the price I'd say it's pretty good, especially compared to games that are 5x the price and have less than half the effort put into them.\n\nIf you're interested in the whole horror series, collecting creepy diary pages that highten the atmostphere, despite the voice acting then I'd certainly recommend it.

There is alot of promise in this work, but unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game. What I can offer is some constructive critiscm.\n\n1. While there are minute differences, it shares all too much with the Slenderman series. I fault that series for the same things found here - the mechanic it is built on is too simple, and the gimmick wears off quickly. That game concept works best as phone or tablet games. To explain further - finding book pages while avoiding a ghost is boring. Maybe if you added RPG-like elements and extended gameplay? Criticism should always be supported with possible options for a fix, IMO.\n\n2. Graphics are bland, at best. If you cannot make it hyper-realistic, I would try to go for a retro look. What you have here is something that falls in the middle, and ultimately just looks like every other basic FPS game. I would bet this was made in some GML or game making program (I don't believe senpai studios actually built those wheelchairs sprite by sprite). Once again, I am just trying to seed ideas.\n\n3. Maybe get rid of the voice acting, and just add captions.\n\n4. Make the Hat Man scarier, and much faster. Maybe make his 'darkness' totally creep and cover your entire view. As-is, he feels like a polygon on a rail.\n\n5. I would do something risky - everything that is currently in this game has been done before. In many cases, it has been done better before. Maybe add split-screen co-op where the second player plays as the Hat Man. Might make for a good couch co-op romp. Who knows?\n\nThank you for reading the above ideas, and thank you again to senpai studios for the free copy. I seriously commend you for seeing the complete developemental process to finish. Not many can actually do that. Keep up the hard work. For my Steam friends - pass on this one.\n\nPeace,\n\n-Ryan","April 19, 2015","false","0.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","3","8","2","1"

You can tell by my play time that I didn't put much time into it, because I'm not into that whole "collect notes while something scary sometimes stalks you" genre that this game is a part of, like Slender and Huntsman: The Orphenage. But at the same time, I'm not sure exactly how much time there is to be put into it; the game has 3 achievements for finishing the game in 30 minutes, 45 minutes, and an hour, and of the apparent 22 notes I found 11 in my second attempt. I couldn't figure out how to save, but it doesn't seem like the game is long enough to justify needing it anyways. The map is visually interesting, at least.\n\nOverall, it's about exactly what you would expect for a $5 game. I'm only giving it a yes recommendation because there's no "indifferent" option; if you're not into the whole note-collecting genre, consider this a "no" recommendation. If you're looking for a real horror game, look elsewhere. But if you've played Slender and Huntsman and all those other games and are looking for something new and don't have very high standards (I mean, you really can't have THAT high of standards if you played Huntsman: The Orphenage), you may as well give this one a try too. It's basically the same thing, only now it has a hat.","April 18, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

(which, by the way, is a great game that you must play sometime) why dont you try out our game!" and then they gave me the key to the game.\n\nmy initial reaction was to laugh. im dead serious. im notorious for making satirical reviews on steam, and my postal 2 review was "10/10 would buy milk from a jihadist again" or something. why did they choose me of all people? to be fair, a lot of people make reviews like this, but i decided to give it a shot.\n\nsoon after, i realized that my profile picture is actually of a youtuber named markiplier with those "deal with it" glasses on for a bit of a laugh. markiplier is an alright guy, but i remembered that i had actually watched a video of him play this game and get extremely frustrated over it. he said it was good i think, but he obviously didnt actually enjoy it that much. i think this may link into why they chose me, as the game has been "updated" as such. i let them know about my concerns but they werent to bothered and didnt give full replies to my questions. i played the game anyway.\n\nthe actual game has either gotten worse since i saw this playthrough, or maybe it was because i was now physically playing the game. let me give you the rundown.\n\n1. the voice acting is some of the worst i have ever heard in a game. it is horrible. the characters have no substance whatsoever to them, no real emotions except for this one set state, which is sort of a happy one. you would think they would be worried that their daughter has just disappeared, and that they were being chased by a large weird "hat man" that might not even be real, along with the fact that the entire place gets screwed over a soon as you pick up a book for some reason, would affect them ever so slightly. it doesnt. they dont seem to give a ♥♥♥♥ to be frank.\n\n2. a team of more than 20 developers made this and couldnt even spell the word "axe". this is extremely worrying to me. who playtested it? one of the graphic designers 5 year old son or something?\n\n3. actually, maybe the graphics designer was 5 years old. sure, its an indie game so my expectations cant be high, but the fact that the same texture was plastered all over an entire corridor can really kill the immersion\n\n4. there isnt really a storyline here. sure, there are pages that you pick up and all, but they arent really all that relevant. its just all about this hat man dude who is now chasing you around, but she seems extremely calm about the entire situation. there is evidence that he exists, and she STILL doesnt care at all\n\n5. the hat man can usually be avoided by walking into a room. this makes for a terrible antagonist, which you can easily escape from. there are times where he will get you, but not many.\n\n6. i havent completed the game for one single reason: this isnt scary. there is very little atmosphere, as stock sounds are used so, so often it just becomes expected. sound is a key aspect in horror games, without it, its going to suck balls. there isnt any tension or relationship created between the player and the environment, so there isnt anything to look out for. i was scared once by a door, i guess. that weird grey girl was too easy to avoid as well.\n\n7. you save by clicking on a tv. how was i supposed to know this? no idea.\n\nhowever, there are good things about this game\n\n1. it was free for me\n\n2. i liked some of the animations. some, not all of them\n\n3. i liked the way that floors kept on looping. i stopped me from reaching dead ends and having to run through the (incredibly boring) atmosphere back again and getting lost. i could just wander around and get back on my feet again\n\ni would have dismissed all of this though if i actually was scared by it. i wouldnt have cared it that was the case. the sad reality is, is that 30 or so devs spent their time on this game. actually, scratch that, im more worried about whoever playtested it.\n\ntl;dr\n\nthe good\nfree (for me, low price until 4th of may too)\nsome animations are neat\nnice building illusion\n\nthe bad\nbad voice acting\nbad developers\noverused graphics\nbad story line\nbrain-dead antagonist\ndefinitely not the scariest game of 2014 (or 2015)\nodd save functions\n\nthe ugly\nthe developers coding skills\n\n\nalso, this is my only serious review on steam.","April 27, 2015","false","0.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

The first time I played this I thought it would be just one of those boring repetitive jump scare games, but I was wrong. The build up towards your death is the most terrifying; not the death itself, as the loud ghostly noises, the creepy whispering when you get close to the journals,  the sounds of the hat man crawling above you; rattling the ceiling panels or a wheel chair ghostly pushed makes you think that he's right around the corner, behind you or in a door way which keeps you on edge throughout.\n\nThe thing that I would like to be improved on is when the hat man finally pops up, as for me it wasn't that scary since he appeared at the end of the corridor where I could easily see him and didn't even chase me. So to improve on this you should make him appear from behind you,  grab you through a missing celling panel or try and grab you though a toilet, as there are so many of them. Also it would be awesome if you added flares to light up rooms that you don't want to go in and make the torch flicker or go out to add even more scares.\n\nJust to say this is an early access game; it won't be a fully perfect game, so don't buy this if you’re looking for a finished game and just wait until it comes out. But honestly this game is so worth getting if you love indie horror games and is just amazing, to say that it’s an early access game.","June 11, 2014","true","1.3"," 18 of 48 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","18","48","0","0"

Taking inspiration from Amnesia: The Dark Descent's ambiance, puzzle/collection-based objectives from a variety of games, and cues from psudo-folklore-derived games like Slenderman, The Hat Man has a lot of familiar and tried-and-true aesthetics while presenting new gameplay elements that are quickly becoming extremely popular for video games, especially in the Horror genre--namely, that it's very replayable. The map generates randomly, and if you stray too far from any one spot, it will have changed completely when you try to return to it.\n\nIf there's one thing that the Horror genre in general relies on, it's atmosphere. As a music composer/writer, I can say with great confidence that what I say next cannot be easily refuted, which is thus: A game that desires to scare, unsettle, unnerve, and frighten, must take great care in creating an experience that tips the audience off-balance, makes them lose their footing, and just when they think they're back on their feet, you pull the rug out from under them. If a Horror game cannot disturb and create suspense, it is operating completely wrong.\n\nNow, of course, your mileage may vary, and various games may not neccessarily scare you. But, for me, anyway, The Hat Man does a great job at creating suspense and keeping me on my toes; like watching the fishing reel scene from Jaws, you'd be utterly amazed at what happens when you just focus on the ambience and the sound effects. In truth, they can sometimes be quite scarier than what's actually trying to scare you. In this regard, I think the developers of this game chose a great collection to work with. This game relies on building suspense and atmosphere rather than relying on conventional jump scares like most other Horror games. In fact, there's only maybe a handful of them in this game, if you can even call some of them so. A refreshing and welcome change of pace, in my opinion.\n\nAll-in-all, a fun game. I can't wait to see what is added and done in the final release. If it's great already, I can scarcely imagine what will happen in the future. To the developers, I say great job, and keep at it.","June 5, 2014","true","0.1"," 11 of 34 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","11","34","0","0"

It's actually to the point where I need to conjure up bravey to press on in certain circumstances.\n\nThere are a couple of things that I absolutele WISH you guys in the developement team could consider:\n\n(these are all things that I expected to happen because of my paranoid nature in-game)\n\n1: Sound lures the Hat Man to you vicinity (Also encourages stealth and focus in a very trying atmosphere)\n\n2: The ability to possibly see him on top of the fallen ceiling-spaces (to encourage a panic causing possibly more trouble)\n\n3: Footsteps, which either i couldn't hear in all the terror, or they just haven't been added yet. (maybe a good echo depending on the acoustics of the room too!)\n\n4: A reflection in a mirror that perhaps isn't broken (which could show the Hat Man behind you on occasion)\n\n5: Perhaps a darker atmosphere to emphasize how important the flashlight or matches are to the player.\n\n6: See the Hat Man PASS a corridor ahead. Where he completely crosses the threashhold of an intersection in front of you. (I have never seen him do that, he's only ever crossed halfway and turned to run at me)\n\n7: Seeing the Hat Man peek out from corners (just a little touch to mess with the player)\n\n8: Maybe even getting captured by the Hat Man only to wake up in a completely unfamiliar area without the flashlight?\n\n9: upon opening a door, he would be on the other side, to attack you; could directly correlate to the above suggestion to where opening doors could lead to your capture and loss of the flashlight (this in my opinion would make players who experience this more likely to not want to open a door in the future, leading to more gameplay)\n\n\nThese are all just things that have crossed my mind during my TINY time of gameplay and while watching countless let's plays. Also in my opinion, it's the little things that most don't notice that are the most terrifying.\nBecause when someone DOES notice something small- that's not actually a trick of the eye, then they WILL continue to see other small things that might not all be genuinely coded.\n\nAll in all, I give the game 9.5/10 terror-induced-craps\n\nI hope to see more of the small things in this BIG game!\n\n-TJ Stratford","July 4, 2014","true","1.3"," 5 of 21 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","5","21","0","0"

It does remind me a bit of Slender, but without the annoying mechanic that fuzzes over the camera .\n\nGraphics: 7/10: It has a very creepy and proper feel to it, but the graphics can get a bit old after a while. Granted it's in beta, so hopefully during official release it will have been touched up. The monster has a rather nice graphics effect when it gets closer and can be seen, granted the ACTUAL Hat Man, is rather hard to make out within the fog till he's right up on you.\n\nSound/Music: 6/10 The sounds and audio are great at first, but after a while they stop being scary, especially when you're having trouble finding pages and are feeling frustrated. The heartbeat mechanic of Hat Man getting closer, is a rather awesome way to tell how close he is and act accordingly, but during the last several pages, when he is popping up all the time (in some of my videos like ever 30 seconds or less), it can get extremely annoying as it becomes all you hear. Still it's in beta, hopefully that'll be polished a bit to where he doesn't pop up so often when you're being super cautious or it isn't as deafening. This is a game you have to play with the sound though, otherwise finding pages will be EXTREMELY hard.\n\nGameplay: 7?/10: I put the ? because I may changed it and move it up, at the present point, I still haven't beaten the game (13 out of ?? pages), though I've finally started to get the hang of it. Hat man is a nice enemy as you can sneak by him and even juke around him (this requires some skill), the stealth works very nicely in the game and leads to some funny survival moments. As you collect more, it seems that real traps start to appear (or there is just a giant pitfall to your death at one point). My only issue with the gameplay is that it's not entirely clear what somethings are for, namely the Matches...I've found Matches, I think they unlock more pages (as I get stuck on 7 pages, find a box and boom I start finding more), maybe a tiny bit of clarity on that...granted could be a journal page I haven't gotten to read yet.\n\nOverall: 7/10 likely to improve up with future edit. It's a good game, if you like this type of game. It could be a little more clear on some issues and have some audio configuration options (there is no way to effect the sound which means if you record, you'll be lower the games sound level during editing). I'd say buy it, especially before it gets closer to finished and increases in price.","June 22, 2014","true","6.5"," 4 of 19 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","4","19","0","0"

My first impression of the game was that once you get in to the shadow realm or whatever you want to call it, very creepy and atmospheric. Like a lot of other horror games that have been released recently, it's Slenderman essentially. Run around with the threat of a being always present and trying to kill you. That does'nt make the game boring though, don't get me wrong! The game is actually good! It has it's own little story in which you are trying to find your daughter who has "dissappeared". All the notes you pick up are hand written notes by your daughter which give you a really cool back story! So if you are killed by The Hat Man, (who is actually very creepy), you have that feeling of, "Hey! I want to go back in there, and find out what happened to my daughter!" The game is very interesting and actually makes you want to complete the game and get the story, instead of some Slender games in which you just collect the notes for the sake of getting notes. Overall I give the game a 7.5/10. Great atmosphere, the sounds are really nice and creepy, and the plot behind it makes you want more. Good game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpCQAcyeJ4w&list=UUzkSzcLFfyYwG2yKZRWB_Xw\nHere is my first video on the game. Check out the gameplay for yourself before purchasing the game.

The model quality lacks and you end up being more afraid of wheelchairs and lights than the hat man himself.\n\nPLEASE. PLEASE.

About a minute in to the game you are pulled in to The Hat Man's world and he calmly says something along the lines of wow now you have my attention. It breaks the emersion and kinda kills the horror aspect of the game. another line after you just axed down a door was Oh I never knew I was so good at breaking things. It just seems very out of place and would of been better left out altogether. It could also be alittle darker Hat Man is a shadow being or something and the games called shadow ward but some hallways are bright like I didn't even need a flash light bright and when I saw Hat Man in those places he just looked comical. Don't get me wrong this is a good game just needs alittle more polish and it could be a great game. I found out they have a thing to shut off the parents voice over.

(I know I only have 8 mins so far on Steam but I have about 7 hours on the Alpha and Beta tests) I strongly recommend trying it out. It is atmospheric and being chased by a shadow person is more than enough incentive to not get caught.\n\nThe atmosphere is amazing, sounds, quietly speaking pages, strange whispers that make you turn around and the map that is never the same.\n\nGood luck!","June 7, 2014","true","0.3"," 3 of 19 people (16%) found this review helpful","16","3","19","0","0"

This game has come pretty far from the beta release when I started playing and is a fair challenge pretty similar to most slender games (Find pages and get out). Beware the shadow people, they will kill you just as quickly as the hat man, and they spawn in random locations. The game is still worth it and I would love to see titles from this producer in the future and see improvement inn their work. They have something going but they aren't 100% on track yet. Still a pretty good game.","December 1, 2014","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BurnLifesHouseDown/recommended/291010/","BurnLifesHouseDown","CombustibleLemons","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BurnLifesHouseDown/","235 products in account","After the most recent update I was asked to come back and check the game out again. This update waqs a very good thing for the game, however the game itself is still not very good. Start with the pros, few as they are, I guess.\n\nPros:Procedurally generated map, each map is different and will change if you decide to double back.\nFalse alarms, when the Hat Man arrives you will be able to hear your own heartbeat as a warning, and unless I am mistaken, smoetimes you can hear your heartbeat when he isn't there. nice false alarm to keep me from lingering in one area for too long.\nDiary pages, the varous diary pages scattered about will tell you tiny bits about the Hat Man and things to do in game, like how to pass the pit of spikes or how to better hide from the Hat Man\nBetter preformence, game breaking lag issues from before the patch have gone away without me upgrading my computer, this means the devs fixed it. And that is kinda it for pros, not many that I can see. For cons here are mine\n\nCons: Crappy Hat Man AI, he can only move if you are not behind something. that means being 1% behind a doorway and even if he is 2 feet from you, he wont move to attack and just sit there\nProcedurally generated, while each map si different, this is an issue. I can spend 2 minutes finding the bar needed to cross the spike pit one game, then it will take 10 minutes the next. At least SCP containment breach had SCP-914 to upgrade the cards.\nRooms, there are about 14 types(roughly, not counting super large ones like the main hall and the hallways with different amounts of doors). The only thing that can change between them are things like wheelchairs that move when approched or broken X-ray projector machines. Some rooms even have 2 or more of the same thing, I saw a 3 way room that had 3 radios, one be each door.\nHat Man, before this update, he would take a few seconds to entangle you before killing you, giving you a brief moment to run. now he just insta kills you like Slenderman does. More of a personal issue though\nDiary pages, while yes, they can help and give hints, it takes waaaaaayyyyyy too long to get that many. I found about 17 of them before I even decided to read them and saw(page 16 or 17 I think) one say how to pass the spike pit.\nMusic, or lack there of. There are not even ambiant background music from what I can hear. Most of the sounds are scripted, like when the few working lights flicker and die, or when the predicatble wheelchair decides to go take a roll. This is more of a personal con as minor ambient music makes the feeling of unease this game needs more powerful.\nLack of scares, After the first few encounters with the Hat Man the scariness goes away and the only thing that is left is the hope he wont appear because then you need to spend time getting away from him rather then hunting for pages to find out what to do next.\nNo save points. Or if there are, I can't find them.\nHat man spawning: Before I plyed off the planks to cross the spike pit, every single time(I do mean every, I counted 14 times over 13 runs, one run i did manage to escape past him) I enetered the spike room, the Hat man spawned in the room behind me, so either I had the crowbar and could escape, which I only had once and still died in another spike pit room due to the journal not puasing the game, or I died.\nLots of cons here. Next is things of note that are not really good or bad, but that I want to mention.\n\nItem noise: Items like pages or other things like the axe or box of matches make noises. The pages sound like whispering and the other items are simmilar, but not exactly the same. The hearing range is large enough so that you can just walk down the hallway and if the page is in a room you can hear it from the hallway, making searching the rooms obsolete\nLack of Shadow people: the devs and the diary talk aobut the "shadow people", yet they only spawn right at the begining after the dairy goes flying off. Wait about 15 seconds then just one will spawn and slowly walk towards you. As soon as you leave the room and pick the dairy cover up, they never appear again. I feel like they are just shoehorned in so that the devs can say "Look! Ghost people! Aren't they scary cause their black and ghosts but not the hat Man!". At least make them appear wandering the ward's hallways or something.\nHorrendous Voice acting: This isn't really an issue that can be fixed easily, as well as it canbe ignored by turning off voices in settings but I still wanted to mention it.\nLatern Head: If the Hat man is close to you(a room or so away) he opens his mouth and light comes from it, or it should. The inside is just a white tube, that when coupled with the shape of his hate, makes his head look like one of those camping lanterns. The humor from this nullifies any fear his arrival is suppose to bring for me but that is just me.\nNow that is over, final scores.\nNOTE THAT 5/10 is AVARAGE! THIS DOES NOT MEAN 5/10 IS BAD, JUST AVARAGE!\nGraphics: 4/10\nStory 2/10\nHorror 1/10\nSounds 6/10*\n\nGrpahics are nothing special, not too bad though\nStory, if it could be called that, is meh. I feel the game would be better if it was taken out entirely, and yes, I know this is based on things people have supposidly seen\nHorror: Nonexisitant after the first encounter, that first encounter is the only thing saving it from a 0/10 score.\nSound: The sounds sound good, and realisitc, however their timing and placement could use tons of work.\n\nMy recomendations for the devs.  Add ambient background noise, something like the track "A Cold Wind Blows" by Kevin Sherwood on youtube. At least something like that would make the game more unsetttling.\nFix Latern head please, as funny as it is, it needs to go for the horror to come back.\nAdd more massive rooms, like the library the girl talked about. I would have loved to see a supermassive library that was 10 times larger then any other room in the game, with tower bookshelves. Plus the close quaters would make when the Hat Man arrives more threatening.\nBetter AI. Fix the first con issue I mention. Or if you can, make him roam the halls and when he gets near you, make an indicator to hide and let the player peak from cover to see him stroll past. That would be really nice.\nMake usefull diary enteries, like how to get over the spike pit, easier to reach. Like make the spike pit page number 6, rather then 15+\nLastly is make some incentive for reading the diary. Were it not because I wanted to get the achivement, I would have never even opened the diary as it didn't seem interesting.Overall I give the game  a 3/10. It is defintly not the worst thing out there anymore, however it still feels like a poorly done Slender clone. And regardless of what they do to it, even with my recomendations, it is not worth 15 USD. 5$, maybe.","April 15, 2015","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The fact that I found this game to be repetitive and boring within the first HALF HOUR of playing it just shows what an awful experience this is.\n\nLet me answer some questions people could have concerning their decision to buy the game.\n\n"Is it scary?"\nNo. You couldn't call this game 'horror' even in the loosest definition. Quality-wise, I'm guessing the developers of this game spent around 4.4 minutes and 99 cents on this game.\n\n"Is it worth 16 cents?"\nNo. I bought this game for that price and I still can't recommend The Hat Man.\n\n"Is it good for s**ts and giggles with friends."\nIf you enjoy aimlessly walking around with no clear objective or purpose, totally!\n\n1.4/10.","May 10, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(don't quote me on that though) Which if they are is a nice touch, and makes the game a little more challenging. Like how in slender the pages aren't always spawned in the same places every time, but there are a finite amount of locations to find them.\n\n- The voice acting isn't bad. The actual reading is good but there have been times I've not been sure about the dialogue. Could just be personal taste though. There is a part where your character makes a joke... and I was kind of like... is this really the time? Focus! Like I say though, could just be me. Overall some of the voice acting is actually very good and this minor detail isn't at all enough to put me off.\n\n- The art style is pretty cool. Very immersive but just unreal enough to freak you out. It reminds me of the game "Deep Sleep" if you wanted to make it 3D rather than 2D. Some of the images in it are very similar and that game sh*t me up when it was just pixels, so this more life-like game is a lovely bag of nope.\n\n- I will note though that the sensitivity of the mouse felt super high and it was very much a case of flailing around, something you'd have to get used to? Occasionally ended up bumping into walls instead of going through doors. :/\n\nWould totally recommend it though. Loving it. Can't wait to finish it and get the whole story which on the whole is shaping up rather nicely!\n\nI recorded myself playing the first part for my gaming channel if anyone wants to see the game being played a little and see what they are in for: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2o7e2QyMnxU\n\nHoping to record me completing it soon!","August 4, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The beginning is nonexistent, you're dumped into an asylum to find a daughter who's voice sounds like a grown woman not a little girl. But back to the gameplay, after picking up the oddly camera shaped flashlight you must pick up some journal pages, but wait you will most likely get killed by the silliest looking horror monster, i proceeded to retry and the only way i could pick up the pages is sprinting around not staying still at all. I lost interest in playing and even attempted to get myself killed so i could screenshot the silly Hat Man. I have no idea if it gets better but i supremely doubt it.

For example, how tf do you save?! Also, there's no way to tell if the game auto saved or not. The first time I was captured, it was toward the begining and it restarted me in front of the journal. Then, I collected two whole sets of pages, listened to them both, got captured again and it started me back in front of the journal. Really?! I have to do that all over again?! You gotta ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me! I quit the game right then. And it doesn't help that it's hard to determine where you've been and where you haven't. Everything is like a maze! I understand that being a horror game, it's designed to build tension, but c'mon! It's very unforgiving knowing that if I get captured, I'm gonna have to do this crap all over again! Some kind of map would be nice. Or at least grant me the option to save when ever I want, or at the very least quicksave. I think it's pretty safe to say that no one likes starting from the beginning, (or close to it) that's usually when people start to lose interest.

For example, how tf do you save?! Also, there's no way to tell if the game auto saved or not. The first time I was captured, it was toward the begining and it restarted me in front of the journal. Then, I collected two whole sets of pages, listened to them both, got captured again and it started me back in front of the journal. Really?! I have to do that all over again?! You gotta ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me! I quit the game right then. And it doesn't help that it's hard to determine where you've been and where you haven't. Everything is like a maze! I understand that being a horror game, it's designed to build tension, but c'mon! It's very unforgiving knowing that if I get captured, I'm gonna have to do this crap all over again! Some kind of map would be nice. Or at least grant me the option to save when ever I want, or at the very least quicksave. I think it's pretty safe to say that no one likes starting from the beginning, (or close to it) that's usually when people start to lose interest. I'll give the game a positive rating, since I definitely got my 19 cents worth. But if I paid full price it'd be thumbs down all the way, without a doubt...","June 18, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So i start the game knowing it has bad graphics but for some reason i got terrible frames despite that, literally 5 frames, after i solved that issue i then go to actually play it. The beginning is nonexistent, you're dumped into an asylum to find a daughter who's voice sounds like a grown woman not a little girl. But back to the gameplay, after picking up the oddly camera shaped flashlight you must pick up some journal pages, but wait you will most likely get killed by the silliest looking horror monster, i proceeded to retry and the only way i could pick up the pages is sprinting around not staying still at all. I lost interest in playing and even attempted to get myself killed so i could screenshot the silly Hat Man. I have no idea if it gets better but i supremely doubt it.

Well, it looks nice. It runs well. It's short, and has both achievements and trading cards.\n\nThe bad? Everything else. It's another typical 'try to survive with a flashlight' horror game, that takes elements from other titles without adding anything new of its own. You wander around the halls of an asylum collecting pages, and eventually a tall shadowy figure named Slenderman The Hat Man comes after you, slowly, so very slowly. Eventually, you'll collect enough pages to trigger the next part of the game.\n\nActing? Atrocious. Worse than the original Resident Evil, if you can believe it. There's no difference between playing as the mother and father, aside from the voice. Even the hand icon that appears when hovering over something usable looks manly, when playing as the mother.\n\nIt's supposedly based on a true story, but I can't find anything referencing the source material, other than a 'legend'. A legend is by definition something that can't be proven, so the whole "true story" is a misnomer.\n\nSUMMARY\nMm no. Not worth it. The lowest price the game has ever been is $0.19 (yes, 19 cents), so for that price, sure, why not. But the game is boring, bland, and rife with concepts that have been done long before and are long overdone.","June 14, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(don't quote me on that though) Which if they are is a nice touch, and makes the game a little more challenging. Like how in slender the pages aren't always spawned in the same places every time, but there are a finite amount of locations to find them.\n\n- The voice acting isn't bad. The actual reading is good but there have been times I've not been sure about the dialogue. Could just be personal taste though. There is a part where your character makes a joke... and I was kind of like... is this really the time? Focus! Like I say though, could just be me. Overall some of the voice acting is actually very good and this minor detail isn't at all enough to put me off.\n\n- The art style is pretty cool. Very immersive but just unreal enough to freak you out. It reminds me of the game "Deep Sleep" if you wanted to make it 3D rather than 2D. Some of the images in it are very similar and that game sh*t me up when it was just pixels, so this more life-like game is a lovely bag of nope.\n\n- I will note though that the sensitivity of the mouse felt super high and it was very much a case of flailing around, something you'd have to get used to? Occasionally ended up bumping into walls instead of going through doors. :/\n\nWould totally recommend it though. Loving it. Can't wait to finish it and get the whole story which on the whole is shaping up rather nicely!\n\nI recorded myself playing the first part for my gaming channel if anyone wants to see the game being played a little and see what they are in for: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2o7e2QyMnxU\n\nHoping to record me completing it soon!","August 4, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's an interesting plot and I like that you can choose your character (kinda) but it would be nice if there was more variety? Once the game is done, that's it. It's done. Maybe if there were more characters with different reasons for going, it'd be fun for longer. But it also definitely needs a small tutorial or some on-screen hints as some things aren't always immediately clear - Like, how to kill the shadow people or how to escape The Hat Man when he appears.

Five Nights at Freddy's.  PT.  Evil Within.  Neverending Nightmares.  Among the Sleep.  Outlast: Whistle Blower.  All far better than this as there is at least one thing scary about them.  And before you argue about budget and indie studios, some developers make games which can do more with less, like NeM.  This game can't do a thing with assets so generic the subtitles and save screens are in default Arial font.\n\nYou wander the same halls, looking at the same four bits of furniture, ignoring the one blood splatter that appears everywhere, picking up the same journal pages, solving the same puzzle over and over by just wandering around until something shiny appears on the floor (e.g. use hammer on lock, use axe on board that's barely attached to a wall holding a door shut).  All the while the Hat Man, looking like a cheap Halloween decoration, floats around at the speed of smell and poses little to no threat or takes on the form of an incredibly-bored sounding little girl ghost.\n\nI haven't been this bored by a "spooky" game in quite some time.

Five Nights at Freddy's.  PT.  Evil Within.  Neverending Nightmares.  Among the Sleep.  Outlast: Whistle Blower.  All far better than this as there is at least one thing scary about them.  And before you argue about budget and indie studios, some developers make games which can do more with less, like NeM.  This game can't do a thing with assets so generic the subtitles and save screens are in default Arial font.\n\nYou wander the same halls, looking at the same four bits of furniture, ignoring the one blood splatter that appears everywhere, picking up the same journal pages, solving the same puzzle over and over by just wandering around until something shiny appears on the floor (e.g. use hammer on lock, use axe on board that's barely attached to a wall holding a door shut).  All the while the Hat Man, looking like a cheap Halloween decoration, floats around at the speed of smell and poses little to no threat or takes on the form of an incredibly-bored sounding little girl ghost.\n\nI haven't been this bored by a "spooky" game in quite some time.  Your time and money are better spent elsewhere.","April 6","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, if you want to get all the achievements prepare to be extremely annoyed, bored and not scared as playing this game for hours will make you horror-proof :^)\n\nP.S. For those who cannot complete “A good book” achievement. I completed it after replaying the game for 4 times.
