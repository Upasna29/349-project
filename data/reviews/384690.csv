Now the first game in the Umihara Kawase series is finally on steam and Umihara Kawase Shun (2nd game) is on it's way before the end of 2015. What a time to be alive.\n\nUmihara Kawase originally came out on the Super Famicom in December 1994 but never got a proper English release until 2015 when it was included as a bonus game with the PS Vita version of Sayonara (and now the PC version as a stand alone release).\n\nThe objective of this game is to go from the beginning of a stage and get to a door (sometimes there's 2 doors that you can choose from, the harder to reach one being a shortcut to later fields) via your trusty fishing rod and by that I mean you gotta grapple, swing and fling yourself across wacky platfoming levels all the while avoiding enemies (fish with legs and a boss or two) and using your crazy rubberband physics skills to get to the exit fast (if you want to speedrun or impress your friends). The game ends either when you run out of lives or you reach one of the final exit doors.\n\nBefore some levels, the game shows you a thing you can do to get through that level, either how to get across some gap or dealing with an enemy or just stuff to help you win at the game.\n\nI don't recommend playing this on keyboard as it has controller support and it feels much better imo playing any of the games in the series with a controller/handheld system. But if you can master keyboard controls then you're a pretty cool person.\n\nMusic is nice, pretty simple but catchy I guess.\n\nOne thing this game had going for it back when it first came out was the ability to save replays. That feature is still around but you also have leaderboards too so if you like leaderboard stuff then you're good to go.\n\nIt's easy to learn for most, a lifetime to master for some. It's Umihara Kawase.","November 3, 2015","true","4.8"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","21","22","3","0"

These fish are gonna walk all over you. This game sure has a quaint sense of humor.\nThis game, It reminds me of how simple and superficial most modern games are. In this game the focus is the gameplay. I can't stress this enough. The gameplay is challenging but there is more to it than simply being hard. It feels balanced and well thought out. If you are looking for a game that doesn't try to wow you with fancy new paint job on a well known trite formula that you've seen two dozen times, then this is a game for you.\n* Have a strong dislike to fish and aquatic life forms?\n* Like sending a small child to cling off a cliff with a rubbery fish line and possibly let her descent to her death (repeatedly)?\n* Always felt tadpoles give birth to frogs and not the other way around?\nIf you answered yes to any of this questions go see a doctor but either way buy this game and play it, it's good.","November 2, 2015","true","9.9"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","17","19","7","0"

Was it a trip by sea, only for those mutated fish to continuously delay your departure by biting holes in your boat or what? Either way, you finally got here. Not that your game was that heavy of a story to really need a full English translation, but the emulation is very solid.\n\nStretching the game to 1080 is a breath of fresh air. Most emulation never made this game look as good as it does right now on Steam. After so many years, we finally have real English menus of this Super Famicom hti that I wanted to play for so long, but just could not properly emulate to run and look good before.\n\nThe controls are MUCH tighter than the other Steam release of Sayonara UmiharaKawase, so much so that I already love this version over that one. The music is bright and cheerful and the cryptic backgrounds look just as disturbing as ever! Truly, this is a very splendid port of a great and fun platforming game.\n\nI wish more Super Nintendo games could be ported to Steam in such a similar fashion. They could easily import more games on here that never saw release overseas. This game is just the start of that very thing happening here. Playing this with my 8Bitdo SFC30 controller is the best experience.","November 11, 2015","true","0.4"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","12","14","2","0"

It's a puzzle platformer where you use a rubber fishing line as a hookshot to get around places, while avoiding puzzle-traps and rad enemies. The fishing line's length can be adjusted during use, and it can be used to pull enemies to their deaths. If you pull an enemy off a ledge and you're still holding on as he falls, he'll also pull you to your death. It's pretty funny. Most levels have multiple exits that will progress you one stage further, or let you skip stages if the exit is either harder to get to or a secret. Anything else I can tell you is obvious information you can learn from watching the store video.\n\nAnyway, if you like Mario Bros. 3 for the challenge, this game is for you. It's a classic.","November 10, 2015","true","4.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

I've been playing the original Super Famicom version of Umihara Kawase for over 10 years, and it still remains a game I come back to with surprising frequency. This series has a lot to offer with challenging and immensely satisfying rope physics that enable you to do all sorts of gravity defying moves. There's a large selection of levels with ever increasing challenge and multiple exits allow you to carve your own path through the game. The controls can be challenging at first, but if you stick with it you'll soon be able to pull off all manner of elaborate stunts using Kawase's stretchy fishing line.\n\nThis Steam version offers many improvements over the original including a practice mode, leaderboards, eliminating slowdown, and other niceties.\n\nHighly recommended to all platfomer fans. And be sure to check out the other games in this series for more fun with Kawase and the Darwinian nightmare fish.","November 25, 2015","true","5.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/radiocase/recommended/384690/","radiocase","RadioCase","http://steamcommunity.com/id/radiocase/","301 products in account","Umihara Kawase is a pleasantly simple and surprisingly difficult game. It's a platformer with a fishing rod mechanic that is both unique and very well implemented. It's essentially a grappling hook which you use to traverse each level. While it's easy to learn how to use the fishing rod and get yourself moving, a much more experienced player can use the rod to quickly maneuver through levels and take tricky shortcuts. The platforming physics combined with the fishing rod's flexible wire gives you a very free range of motion. I highly recommend watching some speedruns of this game to get an idea of how much freedom of movement the fishing rod can allow. It's a fantastic game for anybody that likes tough platforming, skill-based movement, and a steep curve in difficulty.","April 30","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's more than just a port. It's fully-trnaslated, lagless and has an option to practice stages like in Shun and Sayonara. Practicing stages records your IL times too, with a leaderboard that is implemented seamlessly. I've put so many hours into this game on emulators that I just had to buy it legit.
