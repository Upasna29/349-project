Being a fan of visual novels, I can say that this has a lot of elements there that hook someone into enjoying it. I enjoy the thought of the idea "What if..." throughout the whole process and making it come alive throughout this title is something to enjoy unlike in some other games that lead you into a false sense of choice. Overall, great presentation so far with what is given in the demo, favorite part through the story is the fox girl cafe ^-^ and thats saying a lot because "sakura spirit" almost destroyed my love for fox girls in visual novels.\n\nOverall rating:\n\nIts in the demo stages right now so I cannot give it a score for the time being. I will give it a rating of "Enjoyable and want to see more to come."","November 11, 2015","true","6.9"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","17","24","0","0"

The dialogues feel smooth and natural, and the characters' reactions feel understandable and not overly exaggerated or cheesy. I also love the variety of locations, background musics, and their transitions for different moods. They seem abundant and flawless enough. I must say it's also quiet immersive with the investigation minigame and different choices to build relationships with interesting characters in a universe of fantasy filled with cute animal girls and TG possibilities men like me would die for. I am certainly enjoying it.","December 9, 2015","true","33.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

To start off, i'll admit part of the main reason I like this game so much is the theming, I find TG to be very fun, and when big boobs and long hair is involved? You know i'm there. Now, aside from that, my bias aside, this is shaping up to be a very solid game so far, it has the makings of what could be an amazing product easily. It has a ton of diffirent characters already and theres a pretty, admitedly silly, yet deep plot. The options you get are very varried. Despite only being V4, it already has many many many hours of replayability thanks to all the choices you can make. In further addition to that, it's not just a straight up VN Dating Sim style game, it actually lives up to it's name as a cop game. In V4 there is already two pretty intriguing puzzles, they're not exactly super complex, but they can take some figuring out and are pretty enjoyable. Overall, pre bias i'd give the game a solid 8/10 in it's current state of development, even if you're not really into the TG scene you can easily find things to enjoy in this game as it's comedy gold and has a solid plot with really interesting characters.","December 29, 2015","true","12.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

Though animal ears and tails are pretty prevalent too.  If you dont care for that kind of stuff you should probably just move on, because though there is more than that to this game it is the central theme.\n\nThe main character is a Police Officer working in an elite unit tasked with taking down a new drug, MinX.  Through a bit of stupidity, the character gets turned into a girl.  This is a world were people can buy drugs to alter their appearance so it's not considered a big deal.\n\nYou have the standard romance options with the people you work with.   You also have some detective type puzzles to work through, which i rather enjoyed.  Other than that there's alot of dialog to go through and it feels very well written.  I rather got to enjoy the characters in the story.  The game world itself is an extension of another game, "Gender Bender DNA Twister Extreme".  As a result the game worlds lore actually has some depth to it, though its mostly only hinted at here.  I'm not sure but i think this game picks up a year or two after the last one ended, and in a different city.  You will see some return characters though.\n\nSimply put, this game is better than its predecessor.  Or at least i think so, sure you don't get to jump around characters like before and see their different angles of the story.  But, this game seems like it will ultimately be larger and already has more variety of actions, namely the detective style puzzles and i'm hoping they do more with the mini game on your phone.  Regardless, if you liked the previous game get this.  If you thought it was lacking a bit, get this.  If you hated it, don't get this.  And if you have no idea about the other game ask yourself two questions.  Do i want to play a date sim style game?  Can i tolerate transformations that include gender change?\n\nThe only thing i didn't really care for was the serious lack of variation on the characters picture's.  I'm hoping its nothing more than a mark of being early access.  Admittedly it was funny when the characters made a comment about this in regards to a criminal but i'd rather have more variation than a sly 4th wall gag.","February 13","true","38.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Wow, I sure feel that I got what I paid for!\nSo after running the game from beginning to the current end, I have to say that I am not disappointed at all!\n\nThe plot (scroll down to my review below to avoid spoilers)\nThe plot is apparently set in the near-future, where it's been popular with transformation-gas and half human-half animal surgeries and stuff. The technology is quite similar to current, with taser-weapons as regular non-lethal weaponry, normal TVs, cars on wheels and trains still on tracks etc. The gender-transformation is apparently still in its early days with a few biproducts (like lactose-intolerance being a biproduct of cat-ears). Our protagonist however, is a young police officer with about three years of experience. He and his partner, Brad, are part of a department that deals with drugs and stuff and they are currently trying to deal with a new sort of drug called MinX. During their first dispatch, our protagonist ends up having a "tiny" bit of an accident and ends up as a woman. Now, for all of you that came here just for that par, I can promise you that he's not the only one that ends up having to deal with a female body... *giggle*\n\nNow, here's my veiw on other features in the series:\n\nMusic/sound\nI like the music and sound effects, but I miss being able to hear voices and possible have a on/off function of this. What I think would be great is if one could choose between having the characters speak or not. I like the game, but it's a shame when I have to read things 2-3 times because I can't seem to register what I read (this often happens when I'm feeling a bit tired, and that I do often). I also think this could help making the game differ more from other visual novels.\n\nAnimation\nThis part I feel should be separated in two parts: the animated scenes and the regular scenes.\n\nI have to say that I love the scene from the trailer. However I have been playing for 6 hours and only at the current end did I get to enjoy a new, short animation that looked quite similar to the last one. To be honest I feel a bit disappointed. I would very much love to see action or comedy-packed scenes receive even just a short scene now and then. Especially special scenes containing unique situations or characters. It would give the game more interesting content that adds to the regular content.\n\nFor the regular content I want to make one thing clear; NEVER use a picture of the character that doesn't fit in with the action. It's important with variation to ensure that it doesn't look cheap and poorly made. So if a character is bloody, it is bloody, and if a character got ther gender swapped and they have a belt to their pants, they won't try to hold them in place with one hand all the way to their boss's office and then all the way home. Besides,  a womans waist is wider than a mans, and hence it doesn't add up that the protagonist lose his pants (and not the underwear?) when turned into a woman. But enough of that pricky stuff. Overall aside from these few things, the content is good-looking and most of the time it fits well into the situation.\n\nTexting\nI've found some, but very few errors to the texting. So far I guess I have only found places where words are missing, so I just add them in my mind when reading the sentence a second time. It would be nice to see these minor errors corrected, but it's not something that would need to be prioritized at this stage. It may actually be a good thing, as the reader has to stop and read one more time to get the whole picture. It creates a pause and a difference, and it certainly gets the reader's attention back a little. As long as it's only happening 4-5 times in like 6 hours of content, it's not something to get all worked up about.\n\ninteraction with the game\nI simply love how one can affect the game with multiple choices and this should definitely have a continued focus throughout the development. Even though it's a story-based game it should give the player the possibility to interact and affect the game, and even though I haven't really got to test this out much, I have to say that it's still a bit funny. In my case I'm a justice-person so I have an issue with accusing the wrong suspect and stuff like that, in fear of getting both the hard-working protagonist and an innocent in trouble... But I did get an opportunity to run away from a certain cute-girl loving maniac that eventually stunned/tazed the protagonist and dragged her to a swimsuit shop... it was quite funny actually...\n\nAnd that's it for my review! Personally I don't think I'm the right person to set a "grade" on stuff, but in my case I would say 8/10. As the game is not finished yet, my estimate is only for the content so far, not for the finished product.","December 31, 2015","true","17.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I woke up this morning, the sun shining on my face, the beautiful symphony of all the variety of animals singing to each other, the wind bristling across the leaves slowly like a beautiful Bob Ross painting, and best of all full of a feeling of hope and joy for the future. I also knew today was the day “Max’s Big Bust: A Captain Nekorai Tale” would launch, and I was extraordinarily optimistic for what the day held. I sat at my computer desk, pushed the power button on my computer, logged into my desktop, loaded up steam and signed into my account. I knew today was the day we had all been waiting for, and it was assumed this game would not disappoint. I personally identify with a very particular community, and was hoping I would finally receive the representation in the video game industry I had been seeking for so long. Only once before had I felt a game accurately presented my perspective of everyday life, and I was hoping this game would too. So there I was, ready to launch the game, expecting only the highest quality visual novel, but to my dismay this game showed nothing of what I wanted it to. Instead of presenting my perception of my everyday life, all I got was this transgender interactive novel, much rather then a Pigeon dating game in which I longed for. As a self-identified Pigeon Kin, I was gutted to find out there was in fact NO pigeon dating, which I have requested in the past. I can only expect there was a glitch in the game, as a visual novel dating game cannot be complete without pigeons.
