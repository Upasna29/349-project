I can honestly tell you that this challenging, fun, colourful, and charming platformer is one of the best games you can get on steam for 6$ and is an absolute steal at that price. You will find very little platforms with as much content, challenges, and replayability. While you might be thinking to yourself " but how can a box and some squares be that good" ? Well, why don't you buy to find out ;)! This platformer will not let you down!","December 3, 2015","true","3.2"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

There is so much color and vibrant life to this game, as you try to guide yourself through a world of boxes. Hooked almost imediately. Well made. 10/10 would play again.","December 14, 2015","true","3.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
