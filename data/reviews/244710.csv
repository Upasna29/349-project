"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pakkidis/recommended/244710/","Pakkidis","Pakkidis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pakkidis/","1250 products in account","Rating 7.5/10\nOverview:  Adventure\n\n+ The gameplay has you controlling a mother badger with her 5 babies following. You have to find/hunt for food to feed your babies as well as traverse the dangerous environments as you avoid harm.\n\n+ Really loved the art style, it has a minimalistic quality to it yet feels very unique it its own way\n\n+ The game takes place over a series of different environments each area getting progressively more dangerous and more unique. It is always an interesting experience when you reach a new area.\n\n+Losing a baby feels sad and yet you have no choice to move along reminding you the harsh realities of nature. Very few games invoke that sense of feeling yet this game does it in such an easy way.\n\n+ Good sense of pacing,\n\n+No HUD, allowing for a more immersive experience\n\n+ Free DLC to extend the games very short length\n\n\nThe Bad\n\n-game doesn't  do the best of jobs explaining certain gameplay elements often leaving you confused in certain areas.\n\n-The game is very short. It will take roughly 1 hour to beat, there is however a dlc that changes up the gameplay a bit to keep you interested in a few more hours if you like.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThis game is a perfect example of an indie game done right. You don't need super realistic graphics to make the game standout. The developers combined an interesting concept with a unique art style and made a game that I was engaged with throughout the end. Losing a baby is sad because you legitimately feel like you failed as your duty as a parent. This game pleasantly surprised me.\n","November 3, 2014","true","2.1"," 175 of 179 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","175","179","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/244710/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Shelter is a unique experience that will make you care for the little bundles of love that are your squeaking kin.In Shelter there are no score tickers, timers, kill counts, or lives. You play as the mother of five young badgers and your job is to escort them from point A to point B without any of them going hungry or starving.\n\nShelter accomplishes the goal of informing you of duties without the use of clumsy tutorials or a narrator describing you each task. Instead, the game lets you walk around and figure it all out in an organic process that leads to understanding the world quite quickly. Shelter doesn’t tell you to grab the food and bring it to your baby but you understand that it needs to be done before moving on. This lesson naturally teaches you the importance of food to your young’s survival.\nControls are simple; you walk around with W, A, S, D keys and gather/attack with the left mouse button. You can also call for your young with the right mouse button and sprint/crawl with the usual Shift/CTRL scheme.\n\nBefore going on any further about the game I need to pay praise to the wonderful world that Might and Delight has crafted. The entirety of the game, be it in an open field or a damp cave, feels like it’s been hand stitched into a quilt that wraps the player in a warm and sometimes dangerous embrace. The landscapes are bright and colorful, with textures that can only be likened to Wind Waker and even then only slightly so. The art style of Shelter, much like that of the developer’s previous title, Pid, is one entirely unique to the game.\n\nFood is important, it’s your children’s lifeblood and it stands out in the world to make finding it fairly easy. This simple way of making the food standout from the world allows it all to feel, at the risk of sounding redundant, natural.The standout graphical effect isn’t the only way to know food is around; it turns out your children are quite capable of helping you on that front. Your young’s squeals and squeaks of delight when near a food source notifies you to ram into a tree or pull an onion from the ground.\n\nThe threat of starvation is but one of many dangers that loom over your young. Birds of prey soar above, waiting to snatch small badgers for their own, the darkness of a cave calls to them, and forest fires aim to burn all in their path. Every level of Shelter starts off with a simple enough problem, your young need food. Their squeals and squeaks cry out to help and off you go, looking for sustenance.\n\nBut then it all changes, something happens and soon food is an afterthought and the threat of death is one that becomes far more immediate.Your young move slowly so you must wait for them to be close before pushing forward, for fear that they may straggle behind and be snatched by the bird. This sense of immediate danger happens often in Shelter and to the game’s advantage. It’s not often that you care for a non-player character but in this case you care for five, and deeply so. This sense of life and death goes both ways in Shelter as it’s not always your young that are the prey of a hunt.\n\nBadgers are omnivorous creatures so animals are fair game as are fruits and vegetables. Stalking a fox in Shelter and landing the killing blow, knowing it will feed all of your young at once, is an incredibly satisfying moment. From high grass to high grass you crawl, hoping the fox hears nothing, and then, when close enough, you pounce on the fox and land the killing blow.\n\nI must give credit to the phenomenal soundtrack created by Retro Family. They’ve proven their worth by composing a soundtrack that pushes you forward when you know you need to stop and care for your young. Each moment of danger is amplified by the music and when my group was in danger I felt as though I had a responsibility to protect them all. Forest fires wouldn’t stop me from protecting my children and no rapid river would take my baby from me. The music elevates when necessary and amplifies the motherly feeling of each moment.\n\nShelter is a survival game in the basic sense but it’s also about exploration; that being the exploration of yourself as well as the beautiful world around you. Are you the type of person who will try to run from danger or will you stop and brave any harm to protect those you love, Shelter will tell you. The world is crafted in a beautiful manor, the soundtrack amplifies each emotion, and the gameplay, while simple, makes for a deep and moving experience.","March 15, 2015","true","2.1"," 57 of 62 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","57","62","0","2"

Very harsh. This is what this game is about. The controls are simple and the world is  quite small and linear. You're a mother badger who has to look after her cubs. The mechanics are built around that, so if you really try to keep them all alive and well fed the game can be very tense and dramatic. It's short, but I think it accoplishes what it is set out to do quite well; it explores an idea through envoirmental storytelling and solid, coherent mechanics.

You need to feed them on your travels with apples, radishes, carrots, catching frogs, and mice. There are also some other challenges you come across like birds trying to swoop down and nab your babies, fire, and floods from the rain. It's a cool game and fun trying to see how many you can keep alive to the end.\n\nThere's also a nurture mode where you need to feed them each day so they get big enough to travel. Not sure if this goes by real days or just time spent in game. I found two food items in the small area you can forage but that was it. I would need to log back in another day to try and find more. Gives some replay value to the game but not much.\n\nIt won't take long to do one playthrough but you can always replay to see if you can improve or decrease your survival skills.

You have five, and they start to fade when they need food, and you have many dangers to protect them from, like Scary Freaking Birds (TM), forest fires and The Dark.\n\nI got through the first couple levels and thought.. I got this, I'm a great mom. I've got all five badgers, everyone's fed, A+ to me. Then I fell into a cave. And something scared my badgers into the darkness. Ensue baby badger screaming, and then there were four. This irritated me, so I dubbed the one with the white back "my favorite" and put him in charge of keeping the rest of the babies in line.\n\nWe scoured the cave for food, and with my four remaining babies fading fast, I finally found what I hoped to be a way out. Insert scary noise, scrambling baby badgers, and then there were three. I scolded Favorite, and thought about putting him in a time out, but The Dark didn't seem like a great place to do so. We ventured up into the light, finally, killed a fox, survived Scary Freaking Birds (TM), torrential rains, and in an attempt to run upriver against the some rapids, I lost Favorite. I considered giving up right then and there, but I was determined to prove I wasn't a completely worthless mother, so I trudged forward.\n\nI lost my will to lead my two remaining babies to the end. I dubbed one of them "New Favorite", and proceeded to feed him any extra food in hopes it would help us make it through to whatever hope lies at the end of our 'tunnel'. He became a bit of a pig, even stole food from his only remaining sister. We pushed forward through forest fires, past rivers, and more Scary Freaking Birds (TM). Unfortunately, the lack of food to his sister must have ran its toll, because she simply couldn't outrun the bird, and then there was one.\n\nWe were almost there, I could feel it. That, or I was simply going to give up because I couldn't take it anymore. Whichever came first. We reached a large field, I began to run for my life with New Favorite following me faithfully, probably only because he wanted food - at this point he was as large as I was...\n\n--Spoilers Ahead--\n..and the Scary Freaking Bird (TM) attacked me. Repeatedly. I tried running. Hiding. There was no escape. And yet, as my nearly-dead carcass was carried away, the last thoughts in my mind were... "At least New Favorite survived. At least it wasn't my last baby. Maybe my motherhood skills aren't a complete waste..."\n\nAnd then I hoped that little fatty ran, so my sacrifice wasn't for nothing.\n\nI'll wake up to nightmares of badger screams tonight.

In Shelter you play as a mother badger who is protecting her five cubs whilst travelling from one home to a new home. You traverse through five different level styles, all strikingly different from each other in terms of visuals.\n\nThough this is 'a game' available on Steam at a cost of £6.99 there isn't really a whole lot to it gameplay wise, and I would say it feels more like a story or interactive piece of artwork than an actual game. The visuals are what makes this game quite unique: the muted colours, and the blocky textures. The game doesn't give anything away in terms of objectives, or ways in which you can go, though the levels are fairly linear.\n\nThe objectives of the game are basically to travel, and feed/protect your cubs. As you go from level to level, your cubs get chased by birds, scared, sick, and it's your job to keep them together, alive, and well. I completed this game in around 90 minutes with two of my cubs left alive. It genuinely gives you a sense of "Oh no!" when you realise a cub is missing, or when you see one being taken from you. The game relies on a good sense of timing and awareness of your surroundings to get through it without losing any of your cubs (I assume that you can complete the game without losing any cubs).\n\nMy main annoyance with this game was the camera. When you're sneaking through shubbery trying to get your cubs to eat, or spinning the camera to make sure everyone is together, and you get clipping through trees, leaves, and other inanimate objects, it can be very frustrating. Because of the low camera-view it can also be disorientating at times when you're trying to work out what direction to go as everything looks very similar.\n\nI didn't notice anything specific in terms of bugs other than cubs on occasion spin in a circle on their axis instead of actually picking up food that you've put down for them when they're standing on it, and in the third 'Wildfire' level this can be particularly annoying when you need to keep moving.\n\nI won't discuss how the game ends, as that's the only spoiler that can be given about the journey/story. I'll just say that I didn't like it, and to me ruined the games overall sense of purpose.\n\nThis game has previously been available as part of indie bundles, and if you were intrigued to see what it's all about, I'd recommend you wait for a sale or another bundle as £6.99 feels steep for the length of the game. The game is very sweet (and equally harsh) emotionally, the tension in some areas of the levels is great, the soundtrack is good, the visuals are unique. I'd recommend it as a bit of a novelty game (particularly one to fuel the 'are games art?' argument) as I did enjoy the experience, but there is not enough replayability for me, it's too short, and even though I lost cubs during play it didn't feel difficult enough, or emotional enough for me to want to play a level again to see if I could save a cub that I'd lost.","May 8","false","1.6"," 70 of 100 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","70","100","4","0"

This game is set 3 months after the tragic death of your wife, she died after a farmer shot her when she was going to the bathroom. After she died you were left alone to fend for your 5 darling kids. Stripe, Stripe is the athletic type, he's good at football and likes to take the mess out of his little brothers, especially the ginger one but we'll get to him. Then we have Oscar Jr, he has no legs but luckily since his dad is loaded after winning badger olympics 2012 he has spring legs that let him get about. The third child is Jacob, this is the only child of Pistorius' that is adopted, he's actually a rare breed of endagered chinese badger. The fourth child to the couple is David Tones (the ginger mentioned earlier) Tonesy isnt very good at much and always gets bullied by his siblings especially stripes, tones has dreams of joining the badger battalion and serving under super blue badger but sadly for him this would never happen. Last but not least we have Shelby, Shelby is the 5th born of the brothers so her always gets in frays, his favourite pass time is mischief, he doesnt listen to his dad, the young whipper snapper doesnt know his dads advice could someday help him.\n\nThe games opens and you're in some kind of cave with your 5 kids, however for some reason tonesy is laid in a ginger heap on the floor starving to death, I walked into the next room and luckily their was what can only be described as a dead child in a green t-shirt on the floor, I got the child and gave it to tonesy thinking it would finish him for good and I would have one less mouth to feed, but the dead kid brought him back to life. We all set out into the world.\n\nOnce I left the cave the graphics amazed me, word of warning only play in 1080p as it is the best for vis game. I began headbutting apple tree's as this is the only way to harvest apples as a badger, every apple I got I gave to Stripes as he has the best chance of playing for England in th world cup. the others were reyt upset and hungry. eventually I came across a fox, it said "oreyt mate whats up hows your wife and that" I burst into a rage and screamed "U WOT M8, I dint touch her" and jumped at least 15ft into the air, I propelled myself forward using only will power and spring legs onto the fox and sunk my teeth into him just like I did to my wi... nm. My little darlings then feasted on his dead corpse then stripes said "oi tonesy this fox is ginger but ure gingerer lol" and we all lolled.\n\nI thought this game had a mint balanced eco system where badgers reign supreme and cant be stopped. Then all of a sudden the music changed and a Kestrel swooped down and stole my vole lunch. I was shocked my first thought was 'I hope stripes is okay he has a big game next week' I looked back and they were all hid in the grass, I said "Shelby dont go out of vis grass for heavens sake" shelby grinned and ran out of the grass the hawk grabbed him and laughed I was like damn. We set off to find the hawk nes in the hope I could trade some secrets of how to avoid justice in order to get my kid back. when I got there the kestrel was said "You can this un back if I can have tones." so I accpeted and we all watched as tones got eaten by the hawk and then it burped.  eventually we reached the end by this point it was me and stripes as the others had starved.\n\nStriped scored 15 goals and made the england team, I was so proud I wish his mum was here t see it but she's dead, through no fault of my own.\n\nOver all I thought the game mechanics and story line were good, would reccomend to any MLG types looking to hone their quickscopes and survival techniques. After I played this I survived longer in a round as a siper on tf2 than my previous best. Proof tbh. And the character development was good, how the choices I made changed how the story panned out, I would have like Juniour to make it but you cant have it all haha.\n\n10/10 for this badgerific game.","November 9, 2014","true","1.5"," 96 of 145 people (66%) found this review helpful 136 people found this review funny","66","96","145","136","5"

By the end of it, I was just very shocked- only a couple of my kids lived, and I immediately felt a twinge of guilt for my failure. The game is very simple in its mechanics and in the way you operate; you play as a mother badger trying to get by in the wild the best she can, and you go get food for the kids, else they die from starvation.\n\nThe role given to you is clever, as it immediately gives you a sense of responsibility. You develop an attachment to the cubs without any real dialogue; the only thing they do to communicate with you verbally is yelp and squeal, yet I found myself engrossed in them, restarting levels several times if only to keep them safe.\n\nThe levels obviously have a lot of thought put into them, as they each introduce a new type of obstacle that animals face daily, such as predators or floods. The graphics are amazing, the emphasis on textures catching my eye and drawing me into the world presented.- the washed colors give it the look of a storybook. And don't get me started on the soundtrack: It's lovely.\n\nThe ending was very emotional for me, but I won't spoil it for those who haven't played through the game yet. I was reduced to a sobbing mess of tears as I watched the cutscene that went along with it. Shelter god me thinking about life in the wild- desperate, harsh, and generally hopeless. But you will always live on through your children.\n\nIt's made me want to pledge a little money towards helping animals in the wild when I can. I'd recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind a game with animal death in it; it's tragic and beautiful.","May 20, 2015","true","3.4"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","20","21","2","0"

You'll need to keep them fed, and out of harm's way.\n\nMy biggest problem with this game is the lack of content. For the ten dollar price tag, you get about a one hour campaign. There's a "nurture" bonus mode where you bring food to your babies and watch them grow, but it's not very interesting.\n\nThere's really not much to this game. You keep going on a linear path, feeding your offspring any food you come across, and here and there the game will throw a very clearly scripted hazard at you, killing one of your babies if you fail to guide them away from it.\n\nShelter is poorly conveyed. I spent five minutes in the very first room just wandering around, confused. The game refused to let me exit the cave. The only other things in there were a vegetable, some baby badgers, and a dead baby badger. I had to refer to the steam forums to discover that this colorless animal that wasn't moving... was actually just hungry. You have to feed him the vegetable and then he springs back to life, starting the game. It's not as if a bit of on-screen clarification was avoided in order to keep immersion, either, as credits start appearing immediately after this.\n\nThe visuals in this game leave a lot to be desired. It's not due to everything having low amounts of detail - that is actually quite nice and stylized appropriately. The issue is the contrast, which is very low. The entire game looks this way. It was obviously intentional, and God knows why.\n\nLinear and boring gameplay, muddy visuals, poor conveyance.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/madsexual/recommended/244710/","madsexual","Netflix and Phil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/madsexual/","273 products in account","Let me start by saying that even though I'm not recommending this game here, it isn't by any means a broken or even objectively bad game. It's just that what it does offer will appeal to only a very particular type of player.\n\nI am not a good mother. In my first and only playthrough, I managed to lose all but two of my cubs. The cubs must be fed regularly or else... As they get hungrier, they become pale. This makes it easier to decide who gets to eat next, a decision you will be making very often. While the controls are generally manageable, it can sometimes be difficult to steer the mother badger toward the desired cubs at feeding time. The task is somewhat alleviated by the cubs spreading out around you, but they occasionally continue to adjust to your adjustments and a mildly frustrating process of microadjusting with the WASD keys ensues. Fortunately, there is plenty of food in the game, so starvation should never actually be a problem. Were I to play this again, I would try to skip more than half of the food I collected.\n\nThe path you travel is very straightforward. Sometimes areas open up a bit and there might be different routes to take around an obstacle, but they always lead to the same exit. I would have liked to see some kind of reward for exploration apart from another token of the same food items (which, again, are bountiful). As it stands, you are always best rewarded by traveling directly for the exit.\n\nThere are a few timing puzzles. None of them are especially difficult, though it's a bit of a guess how to proceed through the hazards at times. This is always what cost me my cubs. I found this to be one of the game's strengths, however, as it does enhance the feeling of being in the wild and trying to make the best decision possible without all of the necessary information. Reloading is impractical, and the long stretches of relatively boring wandering serve to discourage starting over when something goes wrong. While this is effective in design, it's a bit overwhelming (especially for such a short game) that boredom is the greatest penalty for failure and cheapness. This factor alone is my biggest hesitation about recommending Shelter.\n\nAesthetically the game is a mixed bag as well. I personally enjoyed the music (folky post-rock vibes) and the art style. The most confusing flaw in the production is the washed out look of the game. No matter how I set my monitor, it looks like the brightness is far too high. This might have been designed to give the colors a pastel quality, which it does to some extent, but I found it far too distracting throughout the game. It was something I was never quite able to adjust to.\n\nI try to save my recommendations for games I think anyone could enjoy. Shelter asks for a lot of patience from the player, which will certainly not be for everyone. There are no glaring bugs, however, and the game is short enough to not overstay its welcome for the most part. If you're already intrigued by Shelter, pick it up and have fun! On the other hand, most players should know what they're getting into.","February 8, 2014","false","1.7"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","23","29","0","0"

You are a mother badger and you need to look after your 5 pups by feeding them and protecting them from predators and the elements.\n\nEach time I lost a pup my heart skipped a beat followed by a sadness and guilt. No other game has ever made me cry!!\n\nI won't spoil the ending but I will say it is expected all things consider and in some ways I am glad.\nOnce you have finished the game you get a new mode called 'nuture' this is where you can look after your pups starting from when they are new born and completely helpless. The pups grow bigger as the days go on and will follow you into the world after around day 8. If you don't log in then your pups will die.\n\nThe sound track and game play is great. The camera and graphics not so much so. The graphics do draw you in but it would be better to be a little clearer as it's easy to get lost.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game if you are looking for a thought provoking game which draws you in and takes you on an emotional rollercoaster. However, if you enjoy fast paced, action paced games which are big on thrills and spills then I would definitely suggest you skip it.\n\nI applaud the developer for the accuracy in portraying the animals and I will definitely be getting shelter 2.\n\n","March 25, 2015","true","1.9"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","2"

Shelter casts you as a badger, sole guardian of her five cubs, who must set forth against the harsh world to try and lead her children to safety. Through storms and wildfires, your determination will be tested and the lives of your underlings repeatedly put in danger, as you travel on an intense journey that not everyone will be able to survive.\n\nShelter isn't a game you sit down to relax to; it's a harrowing adventure that at times is truly terrifying do to how emotionally taxing it becomes. Without any dialogue, no hints at a story or exposition of any sort, I became extremely attached to the little badgers I was trying to protect. Prancing around and hopping excitedly when stumbling upon a bit of food, they are almost entirely oblivious to the dangers around them and their joyful manner makes it even more saddening when you inevitably lose one. Death is all around you in Shelter and once a cub is gone, it's gone for good. There are no checkpoints, no extra lives, and no second chances; this helplessness is what makes it such an intense experience, and is something I don't believe I have ever felt in a game.\n\nControlling your badger is simple by design. You can sprint and sneak to catch prey (and avoid being it), pull food from the grounds to feed your children and keep them strong enough to continue on, and often have to rely on stealth to get past hostile animals by sticking to the tall grass. There honestly isn't a whole lot to the gameplay, but that's because it intentionally is not the game's focus. Developer Might and Delight didn't try to make a great "game", it made an experience, one that is intended to make you feel something meaningful, and is an exemplary example for games as an art form.\n\nRegardless of how you view the argument, Shelter is an astoundingly unique pilgrimage through a gorgeous papercraft world, with a masterful score that affects every moment of the game. It's over in just over an hour and will likely leave you with an empty feeling after the credits role, but I think this was what the developers wanted. Nothing is ever perfect in life, and Shelter boldly reflects this fact without taking away your every hope. While certainly not without dispute and it's own share of problems, Shelter made me feel a sense of connection and responsibility that few if any other games have managed to accomplished, and I believe is something that you should be taking note of.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","January 26, 2014","true","1.8"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

In the meantime, this corridor shooter without any shooting will hurl tons (I measured!) of emotionally charged music out of your speakers.

Proper positioning of the food you gather and use of cover (in the form of tall grass) are your keys to survival. Dont do what I did and keep moving forward after dropping food for your kids. I found out after the first two perished that this was probably a bad idea, lol. Keep them in eyesight whenever possible and try to not feed them in the open if that option is available.\n\nAnyway, this is a somewhat slow paced game, but I thought it was pretty cool, and that soundtrack was pretty awesome in my opinion and was perfect for the moments the songs played. The gameplay is as simple as walk/run/look around and then the multipurpose Rmouse/A button which is used to dig up roots, ambush critters, drop the food you gather,and call your kiddos when they wander off.\n\nThe graphics are cool in the same way that the graphics in Proteus are cool. The story/gameplay itself is actually pretty linear although it may not seem that way at first. There are five levels I believe. the ending...well...it's sad, poignant, and a circle of life deal.\n\nAll in all, I felt this was a pretty interesting exploratory game from the viewpoint of a badger. You kind of grow attached to the momma and feel some remorse when you lose one of the kiddos. I think I will give this game an 8 out of 10. There are better games out there, but this one was good and pretty unique as well.","March 6, 2015","true","1.3"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","15","19","2","1"

I protected them, fed them, taught them, hid them from claws and fangs; but it wasn't enough.\n\nCap disappeared in the dark. The worst thing is not knowing what happened to him - did he get lost, did he starve, did he fend for himself and grow up nice and strong? Or did some horrible thing bite into him and drag him away from me as he tried to call to me for help?\n\nStraight Line drowned in the river. I remember the pale red sky pelting us with cold rain, scrambling across jagged stone, and watching helplessly as a flood of frothing mud washed my second born away, forever.\n\nArrowhead flew away. The fire licked our heels, all hiding places burned away. A clever hawk swooped my cub up in cruel claws as we fled through the burning forest in a panic. We didn't have to time to grieve, only to run.\n\nI have two children: Wingtip and Zero, named for the markings on their back. They know all the things a badger should: how to scavenge roots and fruits to eat, how to sneak through weeds and spring upon a fox, how to catch a frog in the reeds at the riverbank, how to bark to find each other in the night, how to weather a storm in a hollow log, how to survive a fire by running on hidden paths, and how to find Shelter in the forest.\n\nI'm tired. Old. Soon I will be too slow to continue hunting, but I am not afraid of death. The regret of not being able to save everyone in my family once ripped at my insides. But they died knowing they were loved, and now as I watch my surviving children scavenge for themselves I can finally sleep.

Being a mother is difficult, and you sacrifice a lot to ensure your offspring outlive you. There's a nice little "circle of life" tale here. The gameplay though is more limited, searching for food to give your little cubs to ensure they don't die of starvation, and following a mostly linear path through life. The game throws various scripted encounters at you, and it can be quite thrilling at times (ducking between the long grass in the middle of a forest fire being the highlight), and losing a cub is really quite affecting. It's a short game, around an hour, and you probably won't want to replay it, but it's a worthwhile experience to have even though it's not quite as good as it could have been. The visuals are unique with its watercolour pallete, and the music fits the mood.

The controls are also relatively minimal, which is good as it doesn't get in the way of the simplicity of the concept and design. It's an ingenious title in that it puts the player in a relatively weak position and forces us to protect our young. I don't believe there's any inherent negative when you lose one of your young, though the emotional effect is there as you count up your young and notice that one of them is missing. Sometimes you're not even sure what happened, but the emptiness can sit with you.\n\nThe invested player will soon find themselves scurrying back and forth quickly, looking for food, scrambling to hide them all when a threatening shadow appears, and generally fretting about the location of each of your young. It very quickly creates just the type of atmosphere it sets out to do. While it may not be a game that its players will return to often, for the price the players will receive an enjoyable, yet stressful, journey that portrays its source material very well.","March 29","true","7.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's simply unique in its simplicity and brings out the beauty of what we seem to have mostly forgotten while living in cities and leading a modern life, ignorant of the continuous struggle to survive in the wild. The simple act of feeding to living another day - it's something that most of us take for granted, but finding food in the wild is an adventure of its own for these wild creatures.\n\nThere are no achievements to unlock in this game. There is no button-mashing involved. No alien robots to vanquish. No zombies to kill. It's simply down to the very basics of nature and how we instinctively react to protect our own. The story is touching and the more you play, the more you get involved into the lives of the mother badger and her cubs. This game exhibits a universal appeal, irrespective of the kind of games you usually love to play. There is adventure in protecting yourself and your family. But at all times, you need to make sure that your cubs are fed regularly. This is as real as it gets, with some elements of surprise intertwined into the story to keep the experience fresh and exciting. The graphics might seem somehow washed out or really bright, but the game really distinguishes itself from all the other games out there by drawing your focus and care to the gameplay itself, although the graphics look really good, once you understand the concept and setting and then you can truly appreciate the majestic beauty in doing the simplest things to stay alive and survive.\n\nForget everything as you dive into this game. There is no 1st place here or any trophy to win. Enjoy nature and living as you would have, all from the perspective of a small creature out on its own to protect its family in the wild. It's magical and well worth the time to experience a great adventure!","January 17, 2014","true","2.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Between predators, starvation, and environmental hazards, being responsible for the survival of five little badger cubs is a terrifying proposition. By the end of the first 'level', there's so much built up tension and dread that the end simply can't come soon enough. Every second is a risk, the next threat could come out of nowhere - a fear which is doubled by the lack of a real saving system. The tragic death of one of the cubs can't be reversed without returning to start of the area and accepting the same risk all over again. Every death feels as if it could have been prevented, despite being unable to control the cubs directly, increasing the guilt of any loss.\nLeaving room for feelings is Shelter's strong suit. Every part of the game is made so simply - the controls consist of movement, a way to quicken that movement, and a single action key; the music is an uncomplicated guitar strumming which becomes more hectic as danger approaches, and the visual style is made up of only a handful of textures repeated over blocky frames. Nothing's left standing in the way of the player's own grand adventure, constructed from a very basic premise: survive and keep your children safe.","April 4","true","6.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If you are into action and saving the world this game is not for you. But if you would like to have a unique survival adventure in a world you have never seen before, this game is for you. The goal of the game is to survive the dangers of nature, and make sure your babies survive the journey. But nature is very hard and will put you on a test to see if you have what it takes to survive. That you have to do this, and especially how is at the beginning of Shelter a mystery.\n\nYou find yourself being an adult badger in a small burrow. You start with 5 cubs, one of your cubs grey and lifeless. You will find food nearby, feed him and he becomes healthy again. When you get out of the burrow you will see a simple square like shaped forest with hand drawn textures. So it is not exactly your beautiful forest but together with the simple colors and minimal guitar music in the background you find yourself feeling safe and thinking all you need to do is walk around a little and feed your babies. The controls are easy and when you walk around pictures will give small instructions on how everything works. (Like shift is used to run and hunt for food).\n\nBut the moment you realize the world is not as safe as you were thinking it is too late. The game will give you a sense of responsibility and survival instinct. There is no time for sorrow when you lose one of your cubs because you need to go on to survive. When there is not enough food  you will have to choose who lives and who dies. The game will learn you that nature is not a safe place.\n\nThe graphics may not be nice and smooth but on the other hand they are unique. The game is very short, about an hour long. So I recommend to wait for a sale instead of buying the game for the full price. But the knowledge that life is at stake at the moment you fail and the constant threat is what makes Shelter a great and unique experience with a bittersweet ending after the credits.","December 27, 2013","true","0.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

It doesn't have too much mechanical depth, but it doesn't need it with such a concise experience.\n\nThe story is touching and explained entirely through gameplay. I won't spoil anything, but if you have any heart at all, you will care for your little pups by the end. The game forces you do deal with frightening or difficult situations, and you really feel for the babies that you don't have any real control over. Also, whether it was intended or not, Smokey The Bear ain't got nothin' on this game.\n\nIt was an interesting and unique experience and I enjoyed my time with it, but that time is basically an hour, with nothing else to unlock or experience, with no divergent paths for subsequent playthroughs. The only thing that can change is how well you play the game, as that directly effects whether or not your pups die along the journey. It is basically the game equivalent of a short film that you'd see after the trailers in a Pixar Film.","December 13, 2013","true","2.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexforbo/recommended/244710/","alexforbo","Shaka1277","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexforbo/","267 products in account","Firstly, Shelter is a short game. Steam says I finished it in 1.1 hours, but I went to the bathroom and forgot to pause it, so probably an hour. I picked the game up on sale on the Humble Store, so I certainly don't feel hard done by. The story is rather moving, and I was sad to lose all but two of my cubs through the game. There is definitely replay value, as I want to finish with all cubs alive! Here are my thoughts:\n\nPROS:\n\n- Excellent pathfinding, except in the last level where my two remaining cubs focused on a tree on two occasions. Using sprint/sneak overrides this and makes them follow, so no biggie.\n- I love the art style, barring a single point in 'cons'.\n- The game is very simple, yet really got my heart pumping in certain sections, especially in the penultimate level.\n- The water foaming worked very well in my opinion and looked great.\n\nCONS:\n\n- The water/waterfall texture is a single rolling texture, which I do not like.\n- The colours are a bit too desaturated at all times for my liking. This is personal preference I admit, but others may be put off by this.\n- No controller support. It's an easy workaround with JoyToKey, but still it shouldn't need to be done. Basic controller support is very common in indie games so I've come to expect it. In any case, Might and Delight (the developers, in case you don't know) also developed Pid, an indie game with full controller support. I sincerely hope that full controller support is included in Shelter 2.\n- When keys are re-bound in-game, the prompts early on do not change to reflect this. Very minor, but worth noting.\n- This is probably my own lack of skill, but I couldn't catch a single fox. I caught a rat by accident, but never a fox as they were too fast for me to catch up on them by sneaking.\n\nOverall, I very much recommend this game, though perhaps not for €10 unless you see at least 4 playthroughs being likely. I very much enjoyed this game and look forward to Shelter 2!\n\nRating: 8/10.

Things like Dear Esther and Gone Home. I myself don't care, since I love both, but that's not the point. At first you would think Shelter to be an interactive experience; something that contains little gameplay and revolves mainly around the artstyle and the unique concept.\n\nHowever, you'd be surprised how much of a game Shelter really is. I wouldn't know what genre to put it in, but I'd say it comes closest to a strategic puzzle game. You play a mother badger looking out for 5 little badger cubs. The game rarely tells you anything, and let's you figure stuff out all on your own. Make one mistake and one of your cute little badgers dies. The only goal is to reach the end with as many cubs alive as possible. On the way you will not only have to find food to feed your cubs, but you will also encounter many dangers in the form of predatory birds, forrest fires, foxes, darkness and strong currents. All require a different tactic to get through. You can't just focus on getting yourself through though! Your babies have to make it too, which adds an extra element of suspense.\n\nShelter is unlike any game on the market. It's unique, simplistic but beautiful artstyle fits the simple gameplay mechanics. The game is short, but succeeds greatly in making you feel attached to your little badger cubs. Trust me; you'll feel really bad when one of them gets eaten because of your neglect. There is little story, but that makes sense. These aren't talking Disney badgers; they're just badgers. They eat stuff and try to survive. That's it. That's the story.\n\nI have to say I adore this game. If you're only into action packed first person shooters I suggest you stay far away, but if you're looking for an unique, artsy and suspenseful gaming experience, pick this up. I do suggest waiting for a sale or indie bundle though, since the lenght doesn't really fit the price point right now.","February 15, 2014","true","1.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You don't have to pay the full price ($10). As far as I'm concerned, wait for a sale, get it on a bundle, or whatever.

If you enjoy art-focused games that tear at your heartstrings, Shelter might be for you. The premise is simple: You play as a mother badger, with a group of five young. Over the course of several events, you must feed five hungry mouths while avoiding the perils of predators, flashfloods, and forest fires. You will lose some young along the way, but nature is cruel and unyielding; we must press on.\n\nThe game is very minimalistic, linear, and offers little to action-oriented players. However, the pastel ornamentation, ambient nature, and--good god--the soundtrack are what make the game. Seriously, that musical scoring is fantastic.\n\nBuy it if you want something different--a change of pace. I can't say it's worth the pricetag for just over an hour of gameplay, but I do believe that this game is a true work of art.

You grow up with your cubs then slowly watch them get plucked from your control; never to be seen by you again. The game is an emotional roller coaster.

It was so short, yet it felt so long. The experience was like that of no other. The music rode along with the game during the whole time. It was sheer bliss. Motherhood has crushed my soul, as my dear cubs were taken from my grasp. It was mother against mother in the end, and that was shocking yet beautiful. Just as the fierce and brave badger mother stayed by her own cubs' sides, the hawk mother did the same for her own babies. The badger mother's efforts and death were not in vain. One cub will live on to repeat the cycle, and have more cubs. The new mother will risk her life for the lives of her own. The cycle will repeat itself. Beautiful.

The first part was clearly hastily tacked on after the game was made.  After that, the game is as it was intended, with a good, visual, as-you-go tutorial that worked perfectly.  The level design (after that first part) was also very good, which required some exploring but was not too confusing.  There are a few more tutorials I wish they had added because I didn't figure them out until later (such as that you have to feed your baby badgers individually if you want the hungry ones to eat).  I will also mention the caveat that the game is only about an hour long, but I picked it up in the winter sale for 2.50, so that's not bad.

This game actually interacted with my emotions.\n\nShelter puts you in the position of a mother badger watching over her five badger cubs. Your goal is to roam the wilderness while finding food for your cubs and survivingthe menacing hawk as well as surviving other natural obstacles such as forest fires and roaring waves.\n\nThere isn't a single line of dialogue but rather a story you create for yourself with YOUR actions. Will your cubs stay fully fed? With they go hungry? Will the hawk capture any of them for lunch? Will they burn alive in the fires of the forest? Will they be swept downstream during a storm when you must find your way upriver for more food?\n\nBy the time the hawk first rears it's ugly head you find yourself already growing attached to your cubs, at least I did. You make it your ultimate goal to keep them alive and nuture them as you watch them grow from cub to fully grown badger. Your ultimate goal is to make sure all five make it to adulthood. I unfortunately only could get 4 of them to the end of the game. I lost one to the natural obstacle known only as the river.\n\nThis game really plays with your emotions. Fear as the hawk arrives, Joy as you catch that tricky fox, disappointment as the mouse crawls into a hole, escaping your grasp.\n\nThe graphics are very unique in their art style and the soundtrack really helps you to get immersed. The game itself is very linear in its destination and the paths you take, but very open in the choices you get to make along the way. Occasionally I ran into a bug where my cubs would stand on food rather than eat it but it's nothing game-breaking.\n\nI give this a 9/10. This is a beautiful game and worth every penny, even more, even for such a short playtime. You can play it through once, play it through until you can finally save all 5 of your cubs, or simply replay it or it's extra "nuture" mode whenver you wish. Nuture mode is where you raise your cubs from infancy to adulthood in a very less-linear way. You can get on the game once a day, go out looking for food, hop off, and do the same the next day until they can walk, then when they can walk, go out looking for food with them. Even this mode has an ending; motherhood is not forever. It's really an amazing game and I think everyone in existence needs to try it.","June 16, 2015","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I can't even remember buying it. But there it was in my library, store page describing it as a survival game where you play a badger with a pack of children. And that's exactly what it is.\n\nBut what I played was so much more.\n\nI mean, I only managed one playthrough, and I don't think I'll do another. But two of my badger children died along the way from what I believe to be a bear or wolf while guiding them through a dark area at night, and another one was swept away by a river. The emotion impact isn't huge, but it comes across as remarkable because of how realistic it is. This kind of survivalism happens in real life. Animals just like badgers, beavers, foxes, squirrels, any sort of animal that lives in the wild really. They come and go and struggle to stay alive, by all means, including hunting other animals. Which Shelter includes. I hunted mice, foxes and frogs. They perished and I apologized, but my badger family was hungry.\n\nI admired the simple graphics, the music started out as how an indie hipster would strum some notes on his acoustic guiter, but it elevated to intense drumming and other instruments, which was nice. I didn't notice any bugs, aside from the last level where badgers would get stuck on the vegatables instead of eating them. Just give the badger kids a shove and they'll see the veggies.\n\nThe games only shortcoming was the purpose of leaving a perfectly reasonable shelter. Why did we have to leave the perfectly reasonable shelter to go on a dangerous adventure? WHY? WHY GODDAMMIT! Two of my badgers died because the developers didn't think, "Hey, what if they just stayed in the area and collected and stored food there?" The person that thought that was probably sacked or thrown out a window.\n\n9/10","July 27, 2014","true","1.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The objective is to simply look after your five children and keep them alive against such difficulties and enemies such as starvation, predators, flash floods and bush fires. In truth the real enemy here is you and how neglectful you are as a mother. More than likely you will witness your children's helpless faces as they get washed away, burned like popcorn, waste away to nothing because you haven't fed them in the last five seconds, or you will simply hear what their screams and bones sound like as they get munched on by the pigs or hyena's that hunt in the night like they are velociraptors.\n\nThe game is short lived as it only has five levels and a bonus tamagotchi level called 'nuture'. The game never holds your hand by telling you what you need to do and so more often than not you will find out the hard way through sacrifice. It isn't extremely difficult to complete this game with all five children still alive on your second run through, but it is on your first run though.\n\nYou will learn various things in this game. You will learn what it means to be in the wild. You will learn the need to distinguish your children and not play favorites. You will learn the need to keep your children in the safety view of your watchful eye. You will learn to look ahead for danger, look for easier paths that do not encourage your children to be distracted from danger and you will learn to scavenge for food. It also teaches you that headbutting things will get you far in life, something that no doubt is useful in the real world too.\n\nThe nuture game is a tamagotchi which requires you to log in daily and nuture your five cubs back to health. Each day you will find 1 or 2 food items. Once the children have been fed about 7 times they will then start to venture with you to the exit of the burrow. After day 7 you will be given a chance to venture further and be given access to the river. As days progress your game level and experiences progress. The limit of this experience is 365 days. You cannot progress any further after that. This level seems to have just been added as an after thought to add some more padding to the game in general and what's on offer.\n\nHighly recommend the game and at least a complete single play through so you can experience it for yourself if it ever goes on sale.

The actual game mode was okay, but I must say however the developer team didn't have as much budgets, if a majority of players actually have to go on the forum discussions just to check how and what to do in the very first 5 mins of the game, it is a bad sign. You should at least give people some sort of instructions, maybe an arrow pointing at the food on the ground (since really, the texture and color choices were horrible, it was so hard to make out the stuff to the eyes), not to mention the dumb precision of having to drop the food at the exact angle/spot.\n\nAnd don't even make me start on nurture mode. I was on Day--I think, 23 or 24? I have been repeating the same things over and over again for nearly a month and there was literally nothing that could tell me about when these cubs will leave or how this mode will end. You just don't expect people to mindlessly do this for everyday or two days without a sense of direction or time goal in mind. This tells you there was a serious lack of thinking in terms of developing and test-playing it in the players' perspective prior to the release. Anddd the result is pretty disastrous. I don't even want to touch this game when it's night/dark raining time in nurture mode, I just kept crashing into walls in the cave or kept getting lost in the map because it was wayyy too difficult to identify the surroundings. (Mind you, there is no map to show you your location or path)\n\nTo be fair though, the real game mode's ending was quite a surprise and I could see it had somewhat educational purpose, which was good. But the more I play nurture mode, the more I think the developers could have done way better than that. I would have to give some consideration whether I should try out Shelter 2 or not in the future, but for now, I just completely lost any desire to do it.\n\n\nFor people who want to try out this game, wait for a good sale maybe, and take my words: don't waste your time to dwell on nurture mode much. It's not worth it.","April 24","false","7.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

An original idea, I agree, and in the time it takes to finish you will experience several situations that might change the story. The whole game takes place in the woods, so it's all colorful and detailed (as far as the graphical style allows). There isn't a whole lot of action, so the gameplay is a bit on the slow side, but you shouldn't get bored of it before the end.\nI, for one, enjoy and welcome games like this, because they usually try to tell a(n emotional) story. Ok, the gameplay may be non-existent, but the experience itself is usually worth the journey.\nSo I guess you could interpret that as a compliment (which it is in this case :))..\n\n[Rating: 78/100]","September 7, 2013","true","3.4"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","1"

The world is pretty empty you are the predetor hunting frogs, foxes and rats. while there is a predetor far superior to you... the eagle. They could have added rabbits, bears maybe even hunters to make it more interesting and have more content but no.\nSo the game is way to empty and to short for me to recomend it at that price point, there are far better indie games for that price as well cheaper\n\nYou can go out and play Free Games that a browser based that got way more content and will take more time to complete compared to this.","January 23, 2014","false","1.3"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

The concept of playing as an animal is good enough, but caring for your adorable offspring is a fantastic idea and I wish I came up with it first. The mechanics work, and gameplay is usually varied. I got extremely attached to my cubs, even naming them (R.IP. O.J. Simpson, Sheriff Willins and Mailtime). I also really like the art style. It worked with the square issue that textured objects face to create a nice, homy quilt feel. And also the endgame. Holy ♥♥♥♥. I can't believe they ended the game like that. I cried my eyes out.\nThe one thing I didn't like about this game was that it was very linear. There were little opportunities for exploration and the objective seemed too clear. This might be a minor issue for some people, but I am not a big fan of linear games. Also, it is kinda short, which I don't mind too much, but I did pay $10 for this game. Shelter, however, makes up for this by controlling your emotions.\nOther than that however, the mechanics work, the art style is nice and it plays with your emotions a lot. A LOT. Shelter is worth $10, and if you get it on sale, use the money you saved to buy tissues. I am very excited for Shelter 2, as in that one you play as bobcats, which probably means you won't get tracked down by that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hawk. Scroll down for spoilers.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\nPass me the tissues\n8.8/10\n\n--------------------------------------------- As River Song would say, "Spoilers!" ---------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end, you are stuck in a wide open field with no tall grass for your cubs to hide in. The hawk first takes one of your pups (poor Mailtime) and goes away for a little while. When she comes back, she proceeds to punch you, then comes around for another punch and so on. Eventually you get so groggy that your babies run off without you, and then the hawk picks you up and carries you off to its nest. There's a shot of your remaining pups walking off into the wilderness, crying, and then the credits roll (insert sobbing here). After the credits, the game then ends with a shot of the hawk carrying your body to its nest full of hungry baby birds. The end. Proceed to bawl even more.","May 13, 2014","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is something that would perhaps be nice in the 90's, in the era of the 3DFx Voodoo accelerators, but nowadays these graphics don't have any appeal.\n\nPLayability is close to nil: there is no hint of what must and should be done in the game.

I finished in just over two hours, and I took my sweet time.\n\nThe controls are easy (WASD, Shift, mouse), the graphics are simple (polygons!) but nice looking, and the music contributes to the atmosphere without intruding on the badger simulation experience.\n\nI received this a gift and although I quite like this game, I don't recommend paying full price ($10) for it, in part because of how short it is. But if you see it on sale, I would definitely recommend picking it and checking it out!","February 5, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

It is something that would perhaps be nice in the 90's, in the era of the 3DFx Voodoo accelerators, but nowadays these graphics don't have any appeal.\n\nPLayability is close to nil: there is no hint of what must and should be done in the game. You start as a badger with its 4 cubs in a cave. So, what now? The game doesn't tip you anything. You might as well stay in the cave. Actually, due to some bug in the game, the badge can't even exit the cave.\n\nAs other users have put it, Shelter is just a plain boring badger simulator, although watching your neighbour's grass grow is a lot more entertaining.\n\nI strongly advise you NOT to get this game. It is a shame how developers even wasted time and effort on a game like this.","February 16, 2014","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NylePudding/recommended/244710/","NylePudding","Llywelyn Ap-Pudding","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NylePudding/","253 products in account","Shelter is by no means a long game, neither is it very deep on a gameplay or mechanical level. That said, Might and Delight have undoubtedly worked to their strengths to make a game that I won't forget. In Shelter you control a mother badger protecting her five cubs. While it's also a very linear game it never presents you with a goal. This is perfect, as the player I was always focusing on the task at hand, remaining in the present I tackled what faced me, rather than think about what was ahead. I found this to be very suited to a game where you control an animal, considering animals mostly think in the present. Unlike us humans.\n\nInterestingly enough, for one of the first times in a game I hardly thought selfishly about my own character's safety. I was always worried about my little baby badgers, not thinking about myself, or my own safety, I didn't even consider if I could get hurt or hungry myself.\n\nIt's lucky you don't have to worry too much about your own safety, since caring for five badger cubs doesn't come easy. I won't ruin the ways in which you can lose them, but lets just say you probably won't get through Shelter without losing the majority of them. Each time I lost a badger cub was actually rather depressing. I was the one who felt like a monster, not the thing that took it away. However with each cub I lost, feeding the remaining ones became much easier, a guilty reminder I had failed them.\n\nFeeding the cubs is a simple matter of uprooting a carrot, headbutting a tree to make apples fall or pouncing on a small rodent or fox. The cubs can't acquire the food themselves, so once you obtain the food you have the choice of which badger to give it to. A cub's hunger is determined by the tone of it's fur, when it's markings are more of a grey tone you know it needs to be fed. That said, this isn't very easy to tell nor does the game tell you this, so often you have to rely on your memory for which one to feed next. Obviously this works nicely as it adds to the pressure.\n\nAs a few final notes, Shelter doesn't look like a horror game, but in many ways it is. I haven't been so afraid and stressed in a video game for such a long time. I was obsessively counting how many cubs I had left, even jumping out of my skin at any sudden noises. This was definitely helped by the fact I played the game in one sitting without getting up. I was extremely absorbed, often forgetting I was was playing a game. It left me with a great new experience but not one I want to repeat any time soon. The most heartbreaking moment that comes to mind; I was hiding in a bush with my last two cubs. As we were moving around in the undergrowth I could swear I saw a third cub, for a second my heart leaped. Alas, on closer inspection there wasn't a third, I knew true and well he/she wasn't alive anymore.\n\nSo all in all, I highly recommend anyone anyone to give Shelter a try. Like I said earlier it isn't long, only clocking 88 minutes to finish it myself. The gameplay isn't very deep either, but it left me with an experience I will never forget. That experience alone certainly makes it worth full price to me. And I haven't even talked about how brilliant the game looks and sounds. However, if you don't want to take that risk be sure to pick it up in a sale. Remember to play it in one sitting, no interruptions, all the way to the end of the credits.\n\nOriginally posted on my blog: http://d-facegames.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/my-thunks-shelter.html","April 2, 2014","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Games such as Dear Esther. Shelter has a special glow to it that makes the game extraordinary. Then again, the game is awful. Now don’t get me wrong. I admire the game, and for the small price it is very much worth it. But… the games flaws are big, yet unfixable. The games flaws almost have nothing to do with the game, its the person. But, before I get to the things wrong with it, why don’t I state whats good about it. For one, its a badger simulator, now who wouldn’t want to play that? The game has beautiful graphics and the art style is different and is amazing. The lighting however should be changeable. The entire game is done with a pastel, almost opaque color. It is almost uncomfortable to look at and can get very annoying at times. Especially during the night. When almost everything is a grayish blue, its hard to find food, keep track of the 5 badgers (I had only one at the time) and see where you are going. Besides the colorm I found its hard to keep the badgers with you. Crouching, or pressing control will bring the badgers to you but only as you hold the key. If the young cubs spot food, they will automatically remove themselves from their mother and hop around it. This can get very annoying. Also, if something frightens the badgers they will run to safety. This happened to me, and my 1 badger and soon I was down to 0 badgers. I looked everywhere, but it was at night and the badger was gone. One issue I have is how quickly the badgers will begin to starve. I lost 3 of my badgers to starvation during the bird of prey section in the beginning of the game. There is no food along the path and I got lost with the several safety patches. I mean really, it is so hard to keep the badgers with and keep them alive. Im amazed how long I was able to keep them with me. I have been a bit too negative though. I don’t want it to sound like a bad game because, it is not at all a bad game. Not even close. The gameplay is smooth and the controls are simple and easily mastered. With only 6 keys and the mouse there are no confusing shortcuts and pointless keys to worry about. The sound effects in this game help far more than you’d think, along with shadows. Hearing the call and seeing the shadow of the large bird of prey will ensure that you get to safety soon and give you fair warnings as to when you may be about to be attacked. At night, many sounds may scare your cubs, or you, but the small call you do will help handfuls to find missing cubs. I like the boundaries by the water to ensure that no baby badgers are sent down to their doom. This game is absolutely extraordinary and is sure to have you playing hours straight.","January 21, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Shelter is short. b. Shelter is not an open-world survival sim, or even, really, aiming to be a realistic survival sim at all, beyond the fact that you're keeping five badger kits alive for two hours. Or . . . trying to. Gameplay's pretty simple. Feed your babies. Don't let them get eaten, drowned, or set on fire. And that's it. But simple as it is, it's a game you can screw up, or a game that can screw you up. Helps that the babies and the landscape are both lovingly designed, and so you're all I must protect you babies, but this landscape wants to devour you and I can't just put you in a safe basket and drag you through the four or five levels, here. When the game's working best, it's anxiety-inducing to lose track of your kids. I had this one point where I thought I lost all of them, and I ended up running my badger around in circles in a broad simulation of aaaaaah. It's good for that.

It is an experience that you have to be willing to assemble in your own mind. You make your own story in the minimialist framework that is provided.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NylePudding/recommended/244710/","NylePudding","Llywelyn Ap-Pudding","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NylePudding/","253 products in account","Shelter is by no means a long game, neither is it very deep on a gameplay or mechanical level. That said, Might and Delight have undoubtedly worked to their strengths to make a game that I won't forget. In Shelter you control a mother badger protecting her five cubs. While it's also a very linear game it never presents you with a goal. This is perfect, as the player I was always focusing on the task at hand, remaining in the present I tackled what faced me, rather than think about what was ahead. I found this to be very suited to a game where you control an animal, considering animals mostly think in the present. Unlike us humans.\n\nInterestingly enough, for one of the first times in a game I hardly thought selfishly about my own character's safety. I was always worried about my little baby badgers, not thinking about myself, or my own safety, I didn't even consider if I could get hurt or hungry myself.\n\nIt's lucky you don't have to worry too much about your own safety, since caring for five badger cubs doesn't come easy. I won't ruin the ways in which you can lose them, but lets just say you probably won't get through Shelter without losing the majority of them. Each time I lost a badger cub was actually rather depressing. I was the one who felt like a monster, not the thing that took it away. However with each cub I lost, feeding the remaining ones became much easier, a guilty reminder I had failed them.\n\nFeeding the cubs is a simple matter of uprooting a carrot, headbutting a tree to make apples fall or pouncing on a small rodent or fox. The cubs can't acquire the food themselves, so once you obtain the food you have the choice of which badger to give it to. A cub's hunger is determined by the tone of it's fur, when it's markings are more of a grey tone you know it needs to be fed. That said, this isn't very easy to tell nor does the game tell you this, so often you have to rely on your memory for which one to feed next. Obviously this works nicely as it adds to the pressure.\n\nAs a few final notes, Shelter doesn't look like a horror game, but in many ways it is. I haven't been so afraid and stressed in a video game for such a long time. I was obsessively counting how many cubs I had left, even jumping out of my skin at any sudden noises. This was definitely helped by the fact I played the game in one sitting without getting up. I was extremely absorbed, often forgetting I was was playing a game. It left me with a great new experience but not one I want to repeat any time soon. The most heartbreaking moment that comes to mind; I was hiding in a bush with my last two cubs. As we were moving around in the undergrowth I could swear I saw a third cub, for a second my heart leaped. Alas, on closer inspection there wasn't a third, I knew true and well he/she wasn't alive anymore.\n\nSo all in all, I highly recommend anyone anyone to give Shelter a try. Like I said earlier it isn't long, only clocking 88 minutes to finish it myself. The gameplay isn't very deep either, but it left me with an experience I will never forget. That experience alone certainly makes it worth full price to me. And I haven't even talked about how brilliant the game looks and sounds. However, if you don't want to take that risk be sure to pick it up in a sale. Remember to play it in one sitting, no interruptions, all the way to the end of the credits.\n\nOriginally posted on my blog: http://d-facegames.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/my-thunks-shelter.html","April 2, 2014","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My only complaint regarding the visuals is that I find the light pastel color scheme a little difficult to make out. This lack of contrast is difficult both because you might not be able to see little tunnels to dive into for cover, and because you tell which of your babies is hungry by them becoming paler. So, you kind of have to be able to tell the difference between "already pale" and "a little more pale".\n\nThe controls are also fairly simple. The game does a pretty good job of informing you what controls perform what fucntion, but like many indie games, it leaves you to figure out when to use them. I kind of like this, because I find a lot fo games these days really hold my hand and don't let me experiment much.\n\nThe main game is short and very linear, though it's not too short for me to feel emotionally attached to the pups ones. The difficulty is far from impossible, but just challenging enough. Despite the short length and simple gameplay, I keep coming back because I hope to eventually have a playthrough where all of my little ones survive.\n\nI think I'd give this about an 8.5/10. It was definitely worth playing, even at the regular $9.99 price. -1 for the low-contrast graphics, and -0.5 for the length.","March 14, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a heartwarming journey in which you are able to witness the growth of your pups as they grow in size and speed, but it leaves you with a gnawing sense of failure in the almost inevitable death of your pups due to hunger, predation or just nature itself.

I had heared about this game before and I wanted to check it out because the review that I've heared were very positive.\nThe whole completion of the game took me 1 h 30 m. However, I have to admit that the game is very well done. It is unlike anything else. The controls and gameplay are rather straight forward, nevertheless it still makes you strongly care about your small fluffy heroes.\nI have to praise the atmosphere created by the developers. Despite the graphics are not particularly intricate, they grasped my attention because of the sophisticated impressionistic style which added up to the whole game universe.\nThe game itself makes you appreciate things that we usually wouldn't notice. The plot twist was a cherry on the cake, even in spite of being slightly predictable.\nTo sum up, I recommend this game to every gamer, as it is something unlike the usual games. Appreciate it rather as a piece of art, then a challenge (which you can find there as well :) ).","August 26, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What I was planning on being just a "Let's Play" video turned into a full playthrough.\n\nIt's engrossing. While I'm not a fan of the incredibly overdone gamma/brightness, and at times the textures they use are a bit over the top, the game is a solid bit of fun. You genuinely start to worry about your little babies (It helps they all have unique markings), and you don't want to see anything bad happen to them. (Though the environment is all too willing to shorten their lives.)\n\nYes it's short (I finished it in a couple of hours), and the graphic style might be a bit much for some, but despite my preconceptions about the game, it got me to do something a lot of other games have not been able to do. It made me care.\nIt was almost an emotional experience, and not one I'm going to forget anytime soon.\n\nIf you want to try a break from the norm, this might have something for you.","April 15, 2014","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Go forward. Grab food. Occassionally go fast or go slow to avoid some hazard. There is no particular goal, no score kept, and no story, so there is no sense of progression or urgency.\n\nYour single goal is to keep the badger cubs alive, but they have no personality, no narrative surrounding them, and there is no penalty if they die, so there is no emotional connection to them: You won't really care if they die or not.\n\nI don't know how long the game is, because I didn't finish it, but however long it is, it's too long, because the game's charm wears off after about 15 minutes, and once the charm is gone, there is no reason to keep playing.","September 8, 2014","false","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Where you are a mother Badger with 5 cubs to take care of.\nYou need to survive 5 areas with your cubs. You lead them, feed them, save them from other animals while you cross lands and waters to a safe place.\nIt's kinda a survival game, without HUD or surviving bars on screen.\n\nPros:- Refreshing, new take on survival games concept.\n- Atmospheric and nice music\n- Edgy & Emotional. Sometimes it makes you happy, laugh, worried, guilty or depressed.\n\nCons:- Too Easy to get lost because of the level design\n- Suicidal cubs AI\n- Short game (Not really bad for me, but probably severe for some others)\n\nConclusions:Yes. I recommend this game if you want a fresh breath from loudy games.\nBut as i stated before, game is short (2 hours long) plus a seperate Extra mode (Nurture).\n\nSo If you don't have a problem buying a short game for $10, go ahead.

I played the game for about one hour before I couldn't be bothered anymore, I realize that's not long enough to give it a solid review, but I felt like I'd experienced just as much of the game after my first 20 minutes as I had after a short hour.\n\nIf you are the kind of player that can really immerse yourself in the game and feel a strong connection to your cubs, and like to grind, this might be a game for you.

It goes outside the mould of standard gaming conventions and instead chooses to tell a tale about a Badger mother who must look after her cubs while traversing vast distance in search of a new home. While the game is only about an hour long, it is one of those games that any game connoisseur should not miss out on.\n\nIf you are only into games for the pointless grinding and getting as many hours out of a single game and exposure as you can until the value of that experience essentially approaches zero, this game is not for you.

One of which being a short indie titled called "Shelter". You play as a mother badger guiding her 5 pups through the woods to find a new home. Why? Because your small den won't be big enough for 5 quickly growing badger babies.\n\nAlong the way, you need to feed them, protect them from fox (which they will eat if you manage to kill one), keep them from the preying eyes of eagles, and from the dangers of wildfire and rushing rivers.\n\nI managed to make it through the first time without a loss of offspring, so all five happy little fat badger babies made it to their new home.\nThe ending was special.\n\n\nA very artisticly styled game that you can spend about an hour on to finish the story.  It was like watching an old story book moving around and easy to find yourself narrating it as you pitter patter around on your little badger toes.\n\nThe replayability isn't overall very high, although if you didn't manage to make it through the first time with all 5 babies, challenge yourself to.","December 2, 2013","true","2.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a real eyesore, especially during the night time section--its a dark night but the darkness is almost blindingly bright. You can kind of tell from the screenshots that it looks like someone dropped a whitewash or bleach over the entire game, and it is even more noticeable when playing.\n\nThe things I were doing seemed to have little impact on the game as well. I actually replayed it after completion to see if feeding my badgers actually did anything. Spoiler alert: it does, but there is so much food in the game that if one of them starves you've either got your eyes closed or are blinded from the ridiculously high gamma. The description asks "Food is to be found, but is there enough for everyone?" and the answer is yes. Definitely.\n\nPros: Good art style (if you can see it through the gamma) Music Bonus game, Nurture, unlocked after completion (probably better than Shelter because it feels more like you're having an impact on your badgers).The idea is fun and the badgers are cute.Neutral: One hour to complete.Con: GammaLinear (invisible walls, being forcibly turned around when you head down the "wrong" path). Scripted events. Never felt any real threat. Gamma Only replayability comes from "hm, was that scripted or did I not run fast enough" type scenarios. Unfortunately, the answer is often the former.\n\nI liked this game, but I wouldn't recommend it. Somewhere between Yes and No would fit better. It didn't feel rewarding to keep my badgers alive because it seemed like they would have survived if I just put a weight on my keyboard to hold the W key down.\n\nPlay it as a walking sim/interactive picture book and it can be nice. I could overlook the gameplay if the gamma was more reasonable.","December 24, 2015","false","1.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It hasn't yet, but this one did today and while i am not as interested in Badgers as a Lynx, i coughed up the money and bought it.\n\nAnd i actually regret it....\nIt wasn't a bad game by any means, it was just not a lot of game for my money, even at half price.\n\nThere is very little in the way of a tutorial and the beginning of the game was rather confusing, as half the time it doesn't tell you what to do. But i started with five lovely cubs- after eventually figuring out that i had to feed one of them at the start to carry on in the game. And to start with it's a nice game. Feeding five cubs is actually rather demanding and i searched for food all the time. Though catching the Foxes is really hard. I only caught one and i never caught a frog at all. xD And keeping your cubs safe from the evil birds and wolves was quite fun and challenging, on my first play through.\n\nI lost four and only managed to get one to the end. :( And the ending, wow. Not what i was expecting at all and personally i don't like it. But for £3 something this game doesn't have a lot in it and for full price it's certainly not worth it.\n1) You pretty much just walk in a predetermined direction, while picking up food and feeding your cubs, while trying (and failing) to avoid getting them killed.\n2) And there are only 5 levels, which took me just over an hour to get through and that's with replaying the last one.\n3) It does have some replay value, as i will try and get all five cubs to the end, but once i have done that, it will probably just sit in my library gathering dust.\n\nWhich is unfortunate really, as this game could be much more. There are not nearly enough animal simulation games out there.\n\nSo in the end, it's not a bad game and i was rather gutted when i lost each one of my cubs, it's just not much of a game and i would therefore sorta recommend it, but only at half price or more preferably. (I will put not recommended though, as i just think it's too expensive for what it is.)","May 26, 2015","false","1.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Visually stunning, and emotionally resonant, this is one of the most memorable games I've played in quite a while.  It's the sort of game you have to experience for yourself to truly appreciate.\n\nThroughout the gorgeous landcapes, death is everywhere.  Your cubs don't have the experience you do; all they know is that you, their mother, will protect them.  But you are just a speck in the vast outdoors, and nature doesn't care about your pitiful pleas for mercy.\n\nThis game is what indie games are all about (for me). Totally breaks the mold of what a traditional game should be about, look like, or play like. It's certainly not for everyone, but everyone should still play it. Such a beautiful, artistic gem.

So basically this game is just wandering around doing absolutely nothing except feeding your cubs, dodging a bird, and walking around. It looked pretty good in the trailers, but it's actually just plain boring. I bought this thinking it was a game where you can explore wherever you want, but you're actually on a set path. This game is barely worth the $2 I payed for it on sale, and you'd have to be crazy to pay $10 for it. One of the reasons I purchased Shelter was because of how nice the graphics looked, but once I started playing, I realized they weren't as good as they seemed. You can barely read the title screen because everything blends in with the background. Everything is really lightly colored. Nothing looks very realistic, and everything is made out of shapes.\nThis game is not worth buying. Maybe it would be if it looked truly realistic, you could jump, fall off ledges, etc.\nI honestly don't know why this recieves so many good reviews. People say the game brings them to tears.

But boy was I ever wrong... I've never, never ONCE, been one to scorn people (read: game developers) for taking a different approach than the "standard average", but I think it's time to break that streak now. This game had an interesting concept, but it completely failed to deliver on pretty much every single point possible (and some I didn't even think it WAS possible to fail at, too!)\n\nFirst, we've got the issue of the controls. They're simple enough, sure... but you don't really have any actual CONTROL over things. Least of all your rather rëtarded little cubs. They run around rampantly, stealing food from their starving siblings, and of course, at the worst of times, they follow their dear mother, i.e. the player. For me, this ended with two being killed by predators, and a third to die by starvation (though not in that order exactly).\n\nThen, we've got the rather extreme issue of orientation. There's absolutely no way to know where you're supposed to go, what you're supposed to do, or hell, even what you're NOT supposed to do. There's nothing worth mentioning in terms of a tutorial, so once you've started playing, you're pretty much left completely clueless as to what to do and when, in order to keep your mentally underdeveloped offspring alive.\n\nNext up, we've got the horrifying graphics. I appreciate funky visuals, don't get me wrong, as I focking LOVED Child of Eden for it's colourful style, and I'm a HUGE fan of the pleasantly vibrant style that Bastion has. Aquaria made me have an eyegasm from its gorgeous graphics. But Shelter? It failed to deliver even a nudge, when I expected a whammy. The colours were so horribly watered out and pale that it was a tremendously underwhelming experience, seeing the game itself, and the brightness was so horrifyingly high that even if I'd completely RUIN my monitor's settings just for this game's sake, it STILL wouldn't be worth it.\n\nFollowing up the last one, we've got that "emotionally instigating sound" the developers are boasting so proudly of. Maybe I've been spoiled with such intense soundtracks as the original Lord of the Rings trilogy's OST, or hell, even the TRON: Legacy music, both of which were awe-inspiring to say the least, but Shelter's sound and music just felt jagged, stale and unstimulating.\n\nAnd last but not least, an issue among games I've been able to cope with since the dawn of my gaming life at the tender age of three... LENGTH. I found Beyond Good & Evil to be pleasantly bite-sized, and basically every CoD-game ever made to be decently lengthy, considering how they've essentially been 99% MP-oriented since installment #4, but Shelter was so infuriatingly short that I didn't feel satisfied at all. Granted, I didn't pay even half the game's, ahem... "actual value" (*mock-cough* BÜLLSHÏT!) since I bought it during the 2013 christmas sale, but even for the low price of 2,24€ it felt lacking and mind-numbingly short. Honestly, I was mad at whatever shïtheads that anally excreted Blue Shift for making such a horrifyingly short game, but you know what? Whoever you guys are, I forgive you. At least you TRIED. At least you provided MORE than a single hour's worth of "gameplay". Maybe not by much... but at least you TRIED. Shelter, however, is originally priced at a whopping 14€ for barely more than an hour's worth of gaming, which is even MORE than what you'll give for games such as Shadow Complex, Castle Crashers or hell, even Magicka, all of which provide (by comparison) infinite amounts of replayability and content.\n\nAll in all, Shelter was without a doubt the biggest gaming blunder of not just 2013, but probably the whole decade. I've seen some bad games out there, like Big Rigs or Nation Red, but most of the games that are bad are that way 'cause of bugs, glitches, imbalanced gameplay, but with Shelter, the fault isn't with the game itself. It's that the developers (a pox on you all) didn't even TRY to deliver anything more than an interactive motion picture at such a ridiculously overdone price that it makes the BluRay copies of Ghibli-flicks seem "fair".\n\nI give this game the lowest rating I've ever given any game ever, and hopefully, it'll remain the ONLY game I'll ever review that I'll give this low of a score to as well... 0.0/10","December 26, 2013","false","0.1"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","2"

There is no shelter. You do not return to a shelter every night (or day, if you're a nocturnal animal). You never do anything but walk and grab food for most of the game. Your cubs don't get hungry, food just makes them ever-so-slightly bigger every time they eat.\n\nOkay, you might think, hey, at least you can forage where you want. Nope. This is not an open world game. This is a "follow the tiny corridors" and "find where the developer wants me to go" game while picking up random fruit along the way. This is a platformer collect-the-coins but with no jumping... or platforms.\n\nThen you get to areas with eagles hunting you, dashing between cover, and that is fun the first time! It is repetitive afterward. Then you hit water streams that FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER either periodically send waves killing your babies, OR, randomly send waves if you stand on the water too long. With ZERO warning and ZERO instruction, you lose your babies. This just in: Rivers don't have gigantic waves. It's not the ocean.\n\nI was down to 2 of my 5 cubs by the end of the game and every single one that died was from some complete B.S. like a cub getting stuck, or not having enough time to cross a stream.\n\nThe fact the game disables the "run" ability all the time, including the intro, makes it feel like it's preaching at you even though you it never says a word the whole time. It's like it forces you to bask in how much pride the developers take in their game.\n\nThe game has good traits. But the problems I mentioned basically sap the fun back out and leaves you wondering... "What that it?" I applaud these guys for doing what they did. But you basically have to REALLY REALLY be wishing for this exact type of game to enjoy it, and if you expected different from the videos, well... you'll be disappointed.\n\nLastly, replayability... there is none. There's nothing to do once you beat the game except try it all over again but without any of the surprises you had.","May 22, 2015","false","1.2"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","13","27","0","2"

But alas, I actually hated my entire experience with it...\n\nI went straight in to "New Game" and had no clue about controls or what to do. It took a good ten minutes - inclusive of a YouTube play-through viewing - to realise the controls. Already I am disliking the amount of time and effort just to get out of my blasted cave...\n\nAtop this is the appaling camera. I am aware that this is an independent game and that "auto" camera is unlikely, but the manual nature of it is extremely irritating, given my constant (every few seconds, perhaps ten or fifteen seconds if I have been walking in a straight line for some time) need to adjust it. If you turn around, you will need to move the camera. If there is an object or scenery item near you, you will need to move the camera. It is that simple.\n\nThen there are the action controls. They are simple enough! One key to do some sort of action such as removing a plant from the ground or giving something to your babies. However, it almost never seems to blooming work! In particular, I was never able to interact with a fruit tree to make it drop its fruit for my babies, which means they will probably die of hunger soon...\n\nAlas, a wonderful concept, beautiful art and world, relaxing and immersive soundtrack... but let-down by OBYSMAL controls!..

It is, by far, 'neat'. While the game is fun, I had to change the controls to something more.. easily accessable. It took a little bit to figure out what to do, since it just throws you into the game.\n\nFirst, I gotta say I love the models for the badgers and foxes. They're widdle and adorable. The noises and music are really nice, too. The second level gives you the 'creepy mood' without being over powering.\n\nThe textures are very... messy. Tiling textures can be a pain, but looking at textures sloppily added onto the objects is also a pain - on the eyes. The textures are nice, but since nothing seems to tile, it just looks like a big, unfinished mess to me. The grass patches are obvious squares that go in alternating directions. It wouldn't take too long to easily make the textures they have tile, becuase they are already quite simple; full ambient, no shading. It is unique in it's own little style, though. You quicky get over it and enjoy the game. I think at first I just found it rather jarring.  I think my biggest pet peeve is the sky at night. Would it really be so hard to add glowing dots rather than what they have?? It looked like the cieling to a children's bedroom.\n\nThe camera seems to get weird during some places, and it doesn't matter if it's close up or far away. Sometimes it just... does a weird 'thing'. Turns itself around? Suddenly too sensitive? It's hard to explain, but it's super prominent in the second level, which was hard to explore. The levels aren't linear - which is usually a good thing - but I find it easy to get lost, only being able to know where I've been from the holes of wild growing.. turnips? I thought they were potted plants, at first. Hehe.\n\nAnyway. The game is simple; maybe too simple. It's still fun, and I feel really bad for losing 2 cubs on the second level! If the textures tiled nicely, and didn't look like they were done in 10 minutes, this would be an awesome little game.

Thirty seconds into the game and I already had to visit the forums in order to figure out what to do.\n\nI lost four out of five babies in story mode without any explaination given at all.  I didn't lose them to the eagle, and I didn't lose them when we got hit by a wave; they were just suddenly gone and never came back.\n\nI tried nurture mode, but once again had to visit the forum because there's no in-game explaination that this mode is partially based in real time.  On day one, apparently all that can be done is bring two apples back to the burrow.  In order to do more, I need to come back another real life day, which seems unlikely at this point.\n\nI like the art, and the slow pace could have been a nice change, but in the end I can't help but feel that nothing I did in the last hour mattered much at all.","May 24","false","1.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

Lost 2 guys, none of which I knew why or how (1 in the dark apparently, because they got randomly spooked and they scattered and 1 must have been out of sight too long, and the other to the bird, while I had no indicator on the ground where it even was...eh).\n\nAnyway, I would not recommend the game for full price. Maybe 1-2 bucks. It's just too short. It's got no real replay value. The tutorial and the HUD itself are vague as in in "almost not present". The 360 controller is now supported, although you can neither rebind those buttons nor does the tutorial show them...they only show the keyboard commands.\n\nThe game itself is fairly short as you've probably guessed now. Your missions is to guide 5 baby badgers to safety. Great that the game starts you off with "saving" 1 of your guys from starving...without telling you that a) he is starving (could also be dead for all I know) or b) how to save him (which brings us to c) where to find food and d) how to get said food and feed it to your young). I've worked it out eventually. You will, too, but it's unnecessary, especially since the game will show you how to gather food AFTER you have already had to do it. Bloody stupid. So, your guys need to stay well fed...apparently the greyer they get the hungrier they are. Apart from that you can also hunt some animals, though not necessary...you can be a vegan in this game and you have to brave some dangers, one of them the frequently returning and annoying hawk, the rest being the night (a whole level), fire (another level) and water (again, another level). All of those require ducking and running basically.\n\nThe game really isn't all that difficult, but you can't save. It's supposed to make you care for your young, but I found that rather hard. Meh, it's an "interesting" game and it deserves credit for what it does and its art style. It is NOT a bad game, it just isn't worth a lot of money in my opinion.","November 29, 2015","false","1.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game is certainly not well optimized, sometimes the framerate dropped even with a high-end machine.\n\nThe thing I disliked the most is the camera. It's a freaking disaster. If you create a badger simulation, where you constantly travel through forest half a meter above ground at most, you must not block the view every time there is a tree. foliage or a boulder between you and the badger. This game does that, and even worse. Often your view is actually inside the rock, tree or bush. You can either zoom in as much as you can to the badger, have zero outlook but not blocked your view much, or zoom out, have great outlook, but blocked your view 50% of the time. I believe camera is really the reason why not recommend this game, that's how bad it is. So sad.

A game about a mother badger feeding and protecting her cubs from the dangerous wildnerness that constantly keeps you on your toes.\n\nThe game consists of 5 levels, each one with a unique theme, the first being a sort of calmer, introductory level to teach players the mechanics of the game (feeding, hunting and hiding), quickly moving on to the scary Night time, an hostile environment that easily scares the cubs, having them running into the predator's den. Then, you'll deal with a rainny day, traversing through overflowing rivers that might just drown you if you're not careful, after that leading to a Fiery forest, trying to keep the flames at bay.\n\nAll this while trying not to be caught by an eagle, the "antagonist" of this game (or is it?), concluding everything in the last level, a constant hide and seek between the two species.\nThis was an unexpected game, with a unique graphic style, and very beautifully done! The game brings a feeling of persistent consequence everytime a cub is lost, since there is no going back after one has been killed. As a result, you're constantly on your toes, and, despite its limited length, it's totally worth the time and money. There's the possibility of multiple playthroughs, trying to save as many cubs as possible.\n\nOverall a very positive experience, which I'll go through at least once again to see how different it is after a good grasp of the  ways of surviving.

You play the part of a single mother badger, desperately trying to lead your helpless badgerlings to safety. Not only do you have to feed the little guys, but you must navagate perils such as swooping raptors and road-kill hungry carnivores with a penchant for badger flesh. At least - I think there are cars eventually, but I don't *actually* have first hand experience with them so they may not actually exists. If they *do* actually exist the drivers may or may not actually intend to hit and/or kill the critters.\n\nI can't with a good conscious recommend this game because of the psychological trauma that I endured after one of my baby badgers, Two Stripes, was swooped up and carried off by an eagle within twenty minutes of starting the game. I found myself falling into a swirling pit of despair, shouting "MY BABY! MY BABY!" It was all for naught, Two Stripes was lost forever. I have yet to resume the game.\n\nOr, if you want to support an indie game about badgers, go for it. In fact, go for it.\n\n","December 23, 2013","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A lot of your time is spent running around, locating or reaching food, and avoiding dangers not for yourself but for your vulnerable pups. The only real defense you have against the natural predators that stalk your pups is stealth, size, and determination.

But it's far too easy to become immersed, to name your individual pups only to realize that your favorte one had gotten swept away by a bird of prey or by the powerful river. The repetition of survival feels present with each life.\n\nFor anyone that enjoys an immersive, beautiful-looking and beautiful-sounding game, Shelter is for you.

I value my experience at about $1, and I wouldn't recommend paying more than that. I finished the game in just under an hour.\n\nShelter was short so I'll try to be too. You're a parent badger and you need to get your 5 cubs to safety. You will forage for food and avoid predators and other dangers along the way. How many babies can you get to the finish? Shelter has a low-poly minimalist style, and I think this is a detriment to the game. What is food doing? Does it help? How much? How urgent is it versus rushing past everything? The game didn't communicate this. The game occurs over 4 medium-ish sized levels.\n\nWith so little to talk about, because there's so little to the game, I was expecting more emotion in the experience, and it didn't really do it for me.

Plenty of games may contain an element of protecting/guilding, such as ‘escorting’ an NPC but this is generally a side note, a means to an end and (more often than not) a hindrance.\n\nShelter encourages you to bond with your offspring right from the get go in the tutorial, where you have to carry food to your cub who is dying of starvation and literally fading away. The risks and difficulty of keeping the cubs alive are continually, and heartbreakingly, ramped up. As well as trying to keep individuals from starving (when cubs will happily try to out compete rival siblings) there are an array of external threats – predators, the natural environment, getting left too far behind, etc. There is an urgency. Hiding while a giant avian predator lets out a piercing cry and the shadow of its wingspan falls over you is genuinely filled with tension.\n\nThis isn't a game to be won so much as an experience to be felt.  And Shelter communicates that experience very effectively...perhaps too effectively, which is why I'm not prepared to put myself through the ringer again (despite thoroughly recommending the game for both intention and execution).","October 19, 2014","true","1.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The gameplay is mostly about running and hiding from other creatures and make sure your cubs make it aswell. You can give your cubs food you find but that's about it.\n\nSometimes when you've been running from danger you'll notice one (or more) of your cubs is missing.

First that will hit you is graphic is unusual but very lovely in same time. You play as mother badger starting in your den with 5 little cubs and one of those need your help straight away as it is weak of starvation,\nSo you get it food or leave it behind your choice. Following is long journey for you and your litter as you take them from the den and on way to safety of mountains where they can learn what it mean to be badger. On your long and tiresome journey you will encounter many obstacles like dark and wolves, hunting eagle (or hawk i cant really tell), crossing creek during heavy rain and at last (not least) the forest fire.\nBut then your journey is finished and safety of mountain forest is front of you there is only last meadow to cross and last Eagle/hawk to avoid so you move on and......\n\nWhat happen then I will not tell to avoid spoilers I only say this, after all the stress and fright of loosing my cubs what happened tear down the last wall and I sat there 5 minutes in tears. When someone make game that can pull you in so much that it slowly scrubbing away all those invisible walls you build so you can deal with everyday ♥♥♥♥ of world out there THAT game is definitely deserve space on your HD.\n\nI am giving this 10/10 things that will make you feel like you are there and badgers this is game for you.\n\n","October 15, 2015","true","1.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

On their journey they get stalked by a bird of prey, encounter perils of the night, river rapids crossings, big forest fires and the looming threat of death by starvation.\n\nFood is to be found, but is there enough for everyone? You will learn that the cubs need food not just to survive, but to enable them overcome the varying challenges they will face as they make their way through the world.\n\nAre you ready for a truly different adventure, something that might evoke feelings you've never felt in a game before? In the wild, all living creatures are put to the test. The question in the end is who will survive to live another day?\n\nRetro Family have once again composed a beautiful soundtrack to an original and graphically innovative setting in a world of nature where shelter is your only hope and survival your only goal.","January 2, 2014","true","121.3"," 10 of 27 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","10","27","0","0"

The music is similarly haunting, with sparse percussion accented by big open chords. You play as a mother badger, looking after your five cubs. You must find them food, guide them through fire and flood, protect them from predators that strike without warning.\n\nThe game is short -- about two hours -- but in that time it mangaged to evoke emotion without a single word of text or spoken dialog; it was a great example of "show don't tell", the best kind of interactive storytelling. The end, in particular, is quite poetic. And if the phrase "interactive storytelling" didn't just make you stop reading in disgust, Shelter is certainly worth your time.","February 3, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aguji/recommended/244710/","aguji","babycakes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aguji/","66 products in account","Quick summary: Shortness of game is worth sale price; more like badger simulation than adventure game; predator threat lacking variety but environmental threat good; motivation to play comes internally from player; great music and art but really high gamma lighting; 3 bugs: autosave fail (recommend backing up .sav file), babies bugged when feeding (restart chapter to fix), babies stuck on objects (just backtrack to fix)\n\n------\n\nI'm actually on the fence about this game, but I selected "recommend" because I personally enjoyed the art and concept of the game. I got into it because I was self-motivated (will explain in #5) and interested in the premise (badger sim). Having put effort into the game, the ending made me rage and QQ with the feels, so I think it succeededl. The ending scene also delivered an understandable message which tied the events of the game together.\n\nHere are some points of discussion:\n\n1) Price. If you speed run this game and don't care about losing your young, you can finish this within a couple of hours, so I don't think it would be worth $10. However, I bought it on sale for $2.49 which was an absolute steal.\n\n2) Art. I love the geometric style. The nature backgrounds look great, and the baby badgers are simply adorable! The only thing is that, as other people have stated, the gamma is insanely high and everything looks washed out. Even though the developers went for that look, I still feel it was a shame given the beautiful art. It also interfered with visibility. The title screen changes according to which chapter you're on, and sometimes it's hard to locate "continue" or change your game settings. In-game, it was difficult to tell which babies needed food, but one method I used was to stand next to them and compare the difference between baby and mama badger.\n\n3) Music. It was great and set the tone for the atmosphere, from peaceful to sinister. My heart was pouding on the nighttime chapter...\n\n4) Gameplay. It feels more like a simulation than an adventure game. Obviously, not all games need to focus on action or combat, but there aren't any puzzles either, unless you count trying to efficiently avoid theats to the babies' well being.\n\n4a) There are simple controls for running, foraging/feeding, and barking. Although the map isn't open world, it's immersive. You must explore to find out what to do, where to go, and how to feed the babies. The minimalist explanations (a circle showing a pictoral demonstration) leave you to figure out how to hunt or get somewhere. Sometimes, the lack of obvious pathways made it difficult to progress to the next chapter. I'll admit I had trouble getting out of the den at the begninning, and I often restarted after losing a baby because I couldn't figure out the correct path in time. It puts a bit of pressure on you as the mom, but I think that is appropriate for this parenting genre.\n\n4b) I have no complaints about the environmental threats, but there was no variety in the predatorial threat until the end. Sometimes facing it was tedious, but it was successful in creating an iconic enemy for the game. Perhaps introducing a different method of avoiding the predator would have kept it fresh.\n\n5) Motivation to play. Players have to be very intrinsically motivated to care about their babies, thus making the player afraid of the various threats to their lives. I think the developers could have added a few subtle ways to get the player to care more about them. I realize creating extra animations are costly, but perhaps even a flashing heart over a baby's head near the mom would work. I'm not sure if they grow bigger in normal mode; I couldn't really tell (a problem slightly related to the gamma).\n\n6) Autosave function. For the normal game mode, I wish there was at least one save point in the middle of the level so that I didn't have to start from the beginning. It's not a big deal, though, since a less forgiving save option also fits this genre.\n\n7) Bugs. I did not have game-breaking bugs, but I encountered 3 of them:\n\n7a) The autosave lost my progess two times and I had to replay up to the same point. I suspect it was due to my friend playing Shelter on my account via Steam Family Share. I would recommend creating backup copies of the save file, located in %APPDATA%>Might and Delight>Shelter>save.grt. I just rename the saves and put them in the Might and Delight folder.\n\n7b) Sometimes the babies wouldn't show interest in food that I picked up, so they did not line up in a semicircle and wait for me to distribute it. It's fixable by simply exiting and restarting the chapter. If you can't fix it, you have to painstakingly walk through the cluster of babies and drop the food in front of the one you want to feed. The babies move to follow the mama, making it hard to get the right one to face you.\n\n7c) Babies can get stuck on objects in the environment such as protruding rocks and small enclosed spaces, e.g. the underground dens and inside the logs. Usually this was fixed by heading back for the baby so that it would shift.","June 1, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game pulls at you emotionally, but unfortunately fails to expound very much upon the mechanics it establishes.\n\nFor instance, none of my cubs ever became hungry enough to fall sick which could have added the challenge of leaving a cub behind and keeping the others safe while trying to find food. Although the game begins with a sick cub, this idea is not once revisited.\n\nOverall, the game is wonderfully made and thoughtfully put together. I definitely recommend playing this, but I wish the ideas were a little more fleshed out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/samueltjohnston/recommended/244710/","samueltjohnston","samuel.t.johnston","http://steamcommunity.com/id/samueltjohnston/","233 products in account",""Shelter" is an unfortunate mix of very good and very frustrating.\n\nThe sound direction is excellent, as is the music, which is rustic and ambient, with an undertone of danger that fits the game perfectly.\n\nThe art is purposefully abstract - the world looks like an elaborate quilt. Unfortunately the beauty is weirdly washed-out, and since there are no options for adjusting the graphics, there's nothing you can do short of cranking down the brightness of your monitor. The camera is problematic, frequently getting stuck behind or inside geometry in the ubiquitous tight spaces and dense foliage.\n\nThe gameplay is sometimes tense, sometimes frustrating, but most often tedious.\n\nThe frustrating parts are largely due to the rules of the game being unclear. Can I actually feed individual cubs, or not? (I found later on that I could, although they would frequently just get stuck spinning around the food, without being able to eat it.) Did I have to sneak through tall grass to avoid birds of prey? (No.) Could I avoid them by hiding under bushes? (No.) Can the river drown my cubs? (No. I mean yes. Sometimes, but not always. What the hell?)\n\nThe nighttime sequence was especially annoying. The game forces you to move slowly, makes everything beyond a foot or so impossible to see, and has your cubs run away from you at random intervals. Fail to chase them down, and they're simply lost forever.\n\nThe best parts of the game are the tense parts - when you're being hunted by birds of prey, and when you're fleeing through the forest fire. These sequences are exciting, and even offer a break from the otherwise linear track as you decide which grassy patch you'll flee to next.\n\nThe remainder of the game is largely monotonous. You wander through a series of foresty corridors, digging up roots and tossing them to the kids. Occasionally you catch a small, furry thing. And toss it to the kids.\n\nI like the idea of the game, but it's fairly flawed, despite its relatively short play-time. If the concept sounds interesting to you, wait for it to go on sale.","August 9, 2014","false","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game relies on you to build a bond with your progeny but never does anything to make you feel attached to them.  Because of this lack of attachment, the game breaks once you realize it’s easier to just let your children die and run to the next objective.  Combine this with twisting levels that are easy to get lost in and a playtime under two hours, it’s hard to recommend even when it’s on sale.","December 28, 2013","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is pretty simple but keeping your young alive is surprisingly difficult and over the course of your hour you'll find plenty of twists and turns and new mechanics to keep things free.\n\nYou'll mostly be wandering around, trying to feed your children by either knocking down apples or even hunting small animals. There will even be times where you are met with more children than food and you have to choose who to feed (hungry children will fade and grow weaker and slower making them easy prey). Avoiding eagles, creatures of the night, trying to keep them calm when they run away scared and keeping them alive during natural disasters makes you grow attached to them.\n\nMy only criticism is that for a game so short there are loading screens (which are quick) but load into very different areas of the forest. Such a short game would have been much better at providing a more seamless transition between the "areas" of the forest.\n\nAll in all it's a great game.","December 28, 2013","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music within really adds to the fact that you are a badger caring for your young. When things get heated, so does the music making for a game with suspense around every tree.

This is the definition of indie, although I'd hesitate to even call it a game. More of an interactive experience than anything else. There is no score kept, minimal tutorial, and very little in the term of gameplay. The goal of Shelter is to guide 5 badger cubs to safety through various different environments as the parent badger, making sure all five are kept safe from predators and well fed. The "game" takes about an hour to complete, but that hour is one emotional rollercoaster. If you have a couple bucks and a little patience Shelter is well worth it. Shelter does a phenomenal job of connecting the player to the badger family he/she is responsible for, especially considering the short completion time.  With the right mind set going into this game it is excellent.

However, I cannot commend it for the story alone.  Clocking it at almost exactly 45 minutes, Shelter is remarkably short.  Despite the game being so short, it introduces a lot of gameplay variations, only to discard each one.  By the middle of the game, I had forgotten to butt trees for apples because there were so many ways to gather food.  Survival is hardly a struggle, just a happening in this game.  Fun mechanics, like the night level and river crossing, were discarded not 15 minutes after they were introduced.  The final level introduces nothing new, just the same easy Hawk-dodge mechanic from early in the game.  The game is also stuck between the "do-it-yourself" school of gaming and the "please-hold-my-hand" brand of tutorial-based gameplay.  (The only challenge in the game is figuring out how to feed your baby in your den.  Everything else is given an instructional pop-up lesson.)

Like really, staying in the beginning cave would have been a better idea but whatever. The question you have to ask yourself is this: Is that enough for you to care? The game doesnt give you more than "these are your children you are the mother protect them" as a reason to care. The artstyle is interesting I wouldn't say good nor bad. The problem with it is that your baby badgers really dont look cute. They squeak in a kind of cute way and that is as good as it gets. This leads to my first problem: I didnt give a ♥♥♥♥ about my baby badgers. Of course I fed them since really there is nothing else to do in this game other than feeding walking and hiding. THe badgers stupidity doesnt help either. Lost 2 badgers to their own stupidity and another one was just suddenly gone without an explanation. That left me with 2 that I still didnt care all to much about. Those 2 made it to the end at least. The gameplay itself is a stealth escort mission that manages to be more annoying than most because of food problems and badger stupidity.  The music did its job, nothing I would buy. THe best moment I had in this game was when I accidently activated a bug and did a 12 meter superjump onto a non-expecting fox.\nFAZIT: If you dont get attached to the badgers this game is a rather boring walking siumlator with food and stealth elements. And Badgers.\n\n\nP.S: Perhaps honey badgers would have been more appropriate, they dont care about all the dangers because they dont need to.","April 24, 2015","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They squeal and follow you obediently as you rummage through the forest in search for food to keep up their health. They rush to the roots to get fed and you pick them up and choose which one to feed. It is a simple method, but as the days pass by in the forest, the terror rises.\n\nA shadow of a large eagle swoops through the field, and you do your best to protect your cubs from the threat. You see that one of your cub's fur is turning dull- the lack of food is making it weaker. With agony you rush through the level in the hopes that the eagle doesn't swoop down to take one of your babies. It is terrifying, especially as you see the weak cub falling back.\n\nAnd then it happens.\n\nThe majestic bird flies down and takes it away, but you can't stop. You have to keep going. There are still four more cubs that need protection.\n\nThis is one scenario that could happen to you depending on how well you play (I for example had to grieve over 4 dead cubs at the end). Early on the parental instincts will kick in as you try to keep them all alive. There is terror when one cub is missing, and the sense of failure as a parent for not being able to protect them.\n\nIt is a very good depiction of the wild life, and even though the game is short, the experience and emotions it brings out is worth more than other games I spent full prize on only to get disappointed with.\n\n8/10","February 21, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kumakurita/recommended/244710/","kumakurita","Hingle McCringleberry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kumakurita/","131 products in account","Shelter is an adventure survival game centered around playing as a mother badger, giving an overall pleasurable experience. Chances are that if you came to this page to view the game that means that you are okay with playing artistic indie games, and at a price of $10 I think this game is well worth the experience it supplies (and for those of you who are on a budget, this game can be picked up for around $2-3 during Steam sales whether it be Fall, Winter, or Summer).\n\nAs a survival adventure game, Shelter exceeds in its art style, which in my opinion can be best described as Low-Poly (if you play the game and grow to love the art style there is a couple of wonderful subreddits that showcase this kind of art style called /r/lowpoly, /r/low_poly, and /r/lowpoly2d).\n\nOverall the experience is superb as you play as a mother badger who is sheltering her five cubs, with an overall arching story that is very compelling and what I would describe as short and sweet. I believe in moderation of story time, and Shelter can take roughly 60-90 minutes to complete. This may sound short to you, but there is an option for multiple play throughs as one may wish to complete the game with all five cubs (if they did not achieve that the first time) althought the ending will always be the same.\nAn additional mode was added at some point called "Nurture" (under "extras" on the menu) which essentially allow you to play the game in a reminescent Tamagotchi like way. I mean this in  the sense that you are now allowed to explore the open world as a badger and *constantly revisit* your five cubs *every day* to *nurture* and feed them until they are adults. It's a relaxing game mode to me since it's a good way to unwind and passively listen to Shelter's amazing sound score.\n\nThings that I did not like about the game mostly revolve around how the cubs that you are to protect have a janky AI which can be unresponsive in following you sometimes (it can range from not many occurences on a level to a fair amount) leading to the AI's impending death and you as the player completing the game without all five cubs. Another thing I noticed was that the environment may appear to be open world, but at least in the campaign mode you are very limited in what and where you can explore. Now in the "extra" feature mode of Nurture this is slightly alleviated but is still present. These two complaints of mine DO NOT DETRACT FROM THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE of the game, but are things that I reflected upon and complained about upon completion of the game.\n\nI would HIGHLY recommend this game, and it's coming sequel called Shelter 2 released by the same studio Might and Delight where in Shelter 2 you play as a lynx and have a supposedly more control and freedom over the open world. The trailer is absolutely magnificent and Shelter 2 will be released sometime next month. If it is anything like Shelte was then it will be a superb game with unique and touching plot points.","January 14, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is about a badger that must protect her pups from the evils of nature while on a journey. Most of the interaction is limited to finding food for the pups and helping them avoid drowning, burning, foxes, and a bird. That damn bird. I really did feel bad the bird ate so many of the kiddies. They have such a horrible scream when they're getting plucked. The game only takes an hour to beat. I managed to only get one of the pups to the end. It might be worth playing again to get all of them to the end. I gotta say, the very final scene that plays after the credits ended gave me a big laugh. The asthetic of the game is really unique. It was a risky gamble, but it's beautifully weird and I dig it. The only thing I didn't like about it was it was too white. Everything looks more washed out than it should have been. More vibrant colors would have made the look even better. Perhaps, along with the twangy guitar soundtrack, the developers were going for giving the game the feel of a dream with the overly-white visuals. Regardless, Shelter is a quality experience.

But it turned out that was only half the case. You only care for the badger kits, and you yourself do not need to eat at all (playing as the mother badger). The graphics are apealing and soundtrack is pleasant, but that means nothing to me if the gameplay isn't at its full potential, and im sure that a portion of the playerbase may feel the same. Plus it's very linear, not really having enough space to explore and have a grand adventure being lost in the woods. Don't get me wrong though, I did enjoy this game for the past hour and a half of playing it(which is the length of the game), foraging and occasionally hunting foxes, voles, and frogs to sate my babies' hunger. But i honestly think this game could have given a bit more in what it's focused on. Then again, I'm not entirely sure of the devolpers intentional feel they want the game to give to its players. If you want a charming, relaxing game that brings you closer to your [badger] family, then this may be one of those games. However, if you desire a more challenging game that truly tests your will to survive (this may be the case in the game's sequel: "Shelter 2"), than I'd suggest looking somewhere else.","June 2, 2014","false","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mimithebrain/recommended/244710/","mimithebrain","MrBadger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mimithebrain/","70 products in account","Very cute game that plays strongly with the player's emotions. The objective of the game is to play the role of a badger mother tending to her cubs. You feed the cubs while progressing through the world and the various 'stages' and protecting them from hazard. Losing a cub leaves a feeling of loss and a failure as a badger mother.\n\nIt's very tempting to speed through the game. This is a game that's meant to be enjoyed in moderation, for the sights and the overall feeling of attachment to the cubs. The scenery is beautiful, but a bit too bright/washed out. It gives it a consistent, calming, pastel colored, albeit polygonal world. If you do try the game, do try to stop and enjoy the surroundings. Highlights of the game include stage 2 (starry night/mother's light), feeling of loss upon losing a badger cub, and a well executed ending.\n\nIt's a very short game, and a bit debatable as to whether 10$ is really the correct price point for it. The nurture mode is apparently modelled after a Tamagotchi style game and looks promising: if returning to the game daily to feed your cubs apples that you knock off from trees with your head and radishes you pluck from the ground is your thing.\n\nThis isn't a Modern Warfare game. It's not meant to be graphically intensive, it doesn't have guns, and it's not overly realistic in the department of European Badger diets. It's not meant to be Badger Simulator 2013, though some would be eager to call it that. If the description above doesn't appeal to you, then don't bother.\n\nIt's a casual, experimental game that's meant to be cute. You want to try this game if you're looking for something unique and are inclined to cute, casual games and prone to the emotional aspect.\n\nI love this game, but in all honesty, I might be biased... just a bit.","April 22, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although I think the developers did this to emphasize themes of survival-of-the-fittest and the inevitable losses of parenthood, it doesn't make for the most enjoyable gameplay experience.\n\nAt just over an hour, Shelter is just the right length as it compresses and contextualizes these themes admirably, yet still fails to provide a compelling progression of gameplay mechanics. While I would have liked to have seen the game more fully fleshed-out, I still laud Might and Delight for tackling such unconventional subject matter within the medium.","December 28, 2013","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a short (~90 minutes) and linear game but very beautifully crafted and does a fine job of eliciting fear, sadness and joy as you make your journey. It's easy to get caught up in the experience and feel as though you're actually taking care of these cubs. That moment when a hawk swoops down and lifts away your child, or watching the rushing water carry them downstream, is surprisingly gut-wrenching. You feel as though you failed not just as someone playing a videogame but also as a parent to these virtual creatures.\n\nThe game's visual style will probably be hit or miss with players. The blocky, pastel-colored design is unique and interesting, but the high brightness/gamma while playing can feel kinda strange. When I was done it took me a few minutes to re-adjust my eyes back to normal. The game also makes great use of audio cues and sound effects throughout to help make you feel more immersed in the nature setting. The camera work can be shoddy at times when near trees, rocks, walls, etc., but I didn't find it to be distracting enough to be a major concern.\n\nOverall, Shelter is a game that does a beautiful job of telling a story about the trials of parenting and the circle of life.

However, I cannot commend it for the story alone.  Clocking it at almost exactly 45 minutes, Shelter is remarkably short.  Despite the game being so short, it introduces a lot of gameplay variations, only to discard each one.  By the middle of the game, I had forgotten to butt trees for apples because there were so many ways to gather food.  Survival is hardly a struggle, just a happening in this game.  Fun mechanics, like the night level and river crossing, were discarded not 15 minutes after they were introduced.  The final level introduces nothing new, just the same easy Hawk-dodge mechanic from early in the game.  The game is also stuck between the "do-it-yourself" school of gaming and the "please-hold-my-hand" brand of tutorial-based gameplay.  (The only challenge in the game is figuring out how to feed your baby in your den.  Everything else is given an instructional pop-up lesson.)

It's a short (~90 minutes) and linear game but very beautifully crafted and does a fine job of eliciting fear, sadness and joy as you make your journey. It's easy to get caught up in the experience and feel as though you're actually taking care of these cubs. That moment when a hawk swoops down and lifts away your child, or watching the rushing water carry them downstream, is surprisingly gut-wrenching. You feel as though you failed not just as someone playing a videogame but also as a parent to these virtual creatures.\n\nThe game's visual style will probably be hit or miss with players. The blocky, pastel-colored design is unique and interesting, but the high brightness/gamma while playing can feel kinda strange. When I was done it took me a few minutes to re-adjust my eyes back to normal. The game also makes great use of audio cues and sound effects throughout to help make you feel more immersed in the nature setting. The camera work can be shoddy at times when near trees, rocks, walls, etc., but I didn't find it to be distracting enough to be a major concern.\n\nOverall, Shelter is a game that does a beautiful job of telling a story about the trials of parenting and the circle of life. A short yet emotionally powerful experience.","December 30, 2013","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you go into Shelter looking for a fin traditional game then you may be disappointed. What Shelter offers in this department is non-traditional graphics, invisible walls, long corridors with little explorations, lite-survival and caretaking elements, some somewhat neat stealth take downs, and annoying birds of death. Oh, and bugs that will cause your badger children to die.\nHowever, if you are looking for a game that also offeres a unique and harrowing experience that puts you in the shoes of motherhood in the animal wilds, trying to do whatever it takes as an omnivore in the middle of the food chain.\nThe graphics remind me of picture books from childhood, recalling tales and fables about animals and their children in their world, full of morals and whatnot. This may be bunk to others, but as an artist it drew me into the world and realitic//naturalistc grapics would have had a lesser effect on me.\nThe soundtrack itself is wonderful, blending into the game perfectly. I cannot say much about it specificly other than it filled the world just right, layering and never pulling me away.\nThe sound effects are good as they should be, the badgers yip and yap in communication, the predatory birds caws are terrifying when first heard, and other animals sounds serve as environmental clues. This is all as it should be.\nSo the real meat of this gaming experience comes to down to the scripted experiences you progress through. Your badger children age and grow as you take them through several environments, each containing various hazards such as darkness, fire, and flooding. You must constantly provide them food of either the vegetable of flesh variety.\nIf you are not the type of person looking to be placed in the role of protector, mother, leader, provider; if you don't find yourself becoming emotionally attached as you play games, then you may want to give Shelter a pass.\nI am a white male gamer, age 32 and fall somewhere in the middle of attachment/unattachment. When my first two badger died to something in the darkness I was sad, but I expected it sooner or later. They were weak and scared. When my next child died in a flood it was upsetting but I still had two strong children to look out for. When one of them was taken by a large raptor because I took a wrong turn in some underground tunnels and came out the dangerous end, I was screaming at the top of my lungs at the computer screen.\nThis game go to me.","January 10, 2014","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The world is also very pretty to look at, which always helps.\n\nPeople you cohabit with will also get some amusement from your gameplay - mainly due to your irrational cries of 'GET AWAY FROM MY BABY' peppered with the odd 'JUST EAT THE STUPID TURNIP - NO, NOT YOU, I MEANT STRIPY - GAAAAAAH'\n","January 10, 2014","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I believe the intent is to mimic the feel of cut construction paper, which follows the general art direction.\n\nSound and music are superb. The environment feels alive and popualted at all times. The musical cues are used to great effect to emphsize mood and provide backdrop, though they're honestly not needed and turning the music off does not make the game feel empty at all. That is incredibly rare.\n\nThe core gameplay concept is very simple: Shephard and feed your younglings. However, Nature is cruel and uncaring. The game is pretty brutal, and each time I lost one of my young I actually protested aloud.

Like really, staying in the beginning cave would have been a better idea but whatever. The question you have to ask yourself is this: Is that enough for you to care? The game doesnt give you more than "these are your children you are the mother protect them" as a reason to care. The artstyle is interesting I wouldn't say good nor bad. The problem with it is that your baby badgers really dont look cute. They squeak in a kind of cute way and that is as good as it gets. This leads to my first problem: I didnt give a ♥♥♥♥ about my baby badgers. Of course I fed them since really there is nothing else to do in this game other than feeding walking and hiding. THe badgers stupidity doesnt help either. Lost 2 badgers to their own stupidity and another one was just suddenly gone without an explanation. That left me with 2 that I still didnt care all to much about. Those 2 made it to the end at least. The gameplay itself is a stealth escort mission that manages to be more annoying than most because of food problems and badger stupidity.  The music did its job, nothing I would buy. THe best moment I had in this game was when I accidently activated a bug and did a 12 meter superjump onto a non-expecting fox.\nFAZIT: If you dont get attached to the badgers this game is a rather boring walking siumlator with food and stealth elements. And Badgers.\n\n\nP.S: Perhaps honey badgers would have been more appropriate, they dont care about all the dangers because they dont need to.","April 24, 2015","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, 50% or more off and I’d be happy with the purchase.\n\nJust a note: developer, why did you pick the most evil animal on Earth for us to be sympathetic for?

I panicked for about five minutes but knew I had to quickly find a safer spot for the remaining babies. Then I guess I ran too fast, and I lost one to the dark. Then, two starved to death in the dark and wouldn't eat. So I had to leave them behind. I had one baby with me finally and I was fierce and protective, but that baby was swept away by a wave while crossing the river. In the end, I didn't even care if I lived or died, and I was eaten by a huge bird.\n\nMy heart is broken. So broken. :(","February 26, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I read that it was a similar feel to Pikmin and cute survival type games.\n\nI was bored and disappointed. And the controls left me motion sick.\n\nI had such high hopes after reading the reviews.\n\nThe geometric aesthetic is lovely but the muted colours hurt my eyes. I'm am sadly not a fan of this game at all.\n\nI didn't feel for the babies at all. I felt more about emotions toward companion cube than the babies I was meant to care for. I was not touched and didn't find it terribly moving.  Which is interesting because I get emotional for everything.\n\n\nI don't mind short games but this was just boring. I feel like I wasted money.\n2/10 - would not recommend.","January 24, 2015","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very short and there's not really that much to it, but the ending is executed perfectly and the art style is nice. Since it's not that expensive, I would recommend it.","September 15, 2013","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

The art, music, even the story. It doesn't explain the game through words or images, instead it shows the storyline through emotion. Everything about this game is amazing. It is definatley worth the buy if you want a beautiful game that is destined to tug at your strings. I would truly like to thank the makers of this game for bringing it upon us, Thank you. It truly shows the nature of how far a mother is willing to go to protect her children.","June 16, 2014","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
