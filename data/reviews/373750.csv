Well, theres the tl;dr answer, its awesome, go get it.\nNow for a proper review...\n\nGame Mechanics\nDinosystem is not your average, typical survival game. It is a deep, in-depth simulation that aims to simulate a prehistoric environment as accurately as possible. Trees aren't just static objects here, they will seed and die and burn. Same goes for sources of water, puddles will form, lakes will dry out in the summer. On top of that, the island you get to roam about in is procedurally generated, so you get to see a slightly different environment every time you start a new game. This level of depth in the mechanics is also shown with the player character and animal species on the island. Dinosaurs need to eat, sleep, drink and to reproduce. Different animals have different behaviours as well, for example, Ankylosaurs are more solitary animals, preffering to wander on their own or in very small groups, whereas Triceratops will move about in large herds.\n\nPlayer Mechanics\nMost survival games will have a basic hunger and thirst system, dinosystem takes this even further, you have to manage your stomach contents, drink and eat enough, not too little, not too much. Every action you perform tires out your character. Depending on your lifestyle, your character can grow to become fit and healthy, or they could get weaker, or fat. The way you play the game determines how your character develops.\n\nEarly Access\nThe game gets updated fairly regularly, roughly fortnightly to monthly. The developer is very dedicated to the project, he is very active on the forums and discussions and we talk pretty regularly about the game and stuff over steam (so, little disclaimer there). Coming very, very soon should be a really awesome update, followed by an even awesome-er one next month :D. So yeah, the commitment to the early access is really good and the developer has a clear plan for the order of the updates, so the finished release is planned out with all the content, there wont be any releasing early here. The finished game should be ready about late 2016.\n\nGameplay\nA lot of the game revolves around keeping your character healthy and... not dead. There is a crafting system with a decent amount of items to craft with what you can salvage, the higher level of which normally require harder-to-get materials, such as dinosaur pelts. The combat and movement will feel strange at first, as it controls just a little differently to some other top-down games (mainly talking about the combat system there) but stick with it, because its worth it and becomes a really rewarding and fun experience. There are 4 very different seasons to each year (so, real life stuff) that force you to change your lifestyle to adapt to the new environmental conditions. Winter is, undoubtedly, the harshest of all the seasons due to the unrelenting cold.\n\nPositive\n- Deep, Complex Gameplay\n- Nice Stylised Graphics\n- Very Rewarding (especially when killing dinosaurs)\n- Hardcore Mode\n\nNegative\n- Not that much content (dont forget, early access)\n\nFinal Rating: 9/10","September 9, 2015","true","40.0"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","18","19","2","2"

I cant even remember what it was called but many years ago a game existed online that was somewhat simular to this; Anyway thanks again im so glad this is on steam and brand new ! :D\n\nAs for the game itself its so far brilliant, I do hope the developers focus more on the God mode and open world aspect as well as the roleplay of it rather than the actual story and id be happy to promote and recommend this game , Its brilliant !\n\nPS.

However the developer was kind enough to give me an alpha version to play back in April.  I can say that this game has come a long ways in the past two months, and the developer is proving to be very hard at work at bringing this game to his original dreams and visions!\n\nIt's a single player survival game filled with tons of stats, realistic and believable cause and effect scenarios, and the thrill of being prey to the evil t-rex who makes you feel truly small in comparison.  This is a game where you are not the center of the game world, but rather just a part of it's eco-system and trying your best to surivive as long and as well as you can in it.  Death will come to you, the question is more how long can you last, and how will death on you take its toll.\n\nI like it, and you can watch my above video if you want to see how and why it scored an impressive early access score from me of an 82%.","June 25, 2015","true","0.8"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","66","21","32","6","1"

I may change my review once the game is out.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDay 3, I still don't know what to do. Day 5, I'm in a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situations. Day 6, I finished the tutorial. Day 7. I closed the game.\n\nDinoSystem is a top down survival game set in the prehistoric era. You can create the world or have the game generate it for you. The aim of the game is for you to survive a densely populated area by gathering materials for survival, like stones, twigs, leaves, even hunt dinosaurs for food once you craft a good bow or a spear.\n\nI love the idea of the game especially the character creation and the freedom to distribute stats, it's very interesting. Your character levels up according to what actions you take, similar to the oblivion series. I like the setting and its very cool to discover new things once you invest time reading the tutorial.\n\nBut that's it. I feel very bored at the start of the game, the visuals itself is a letdown and what's worse is the controls. The game is top down and you are using your WASD keys to move your character, which is very unresponsive and awkward especially if you want to turn your character in a different direction. I have played zombie shooter and other games which uses the same control mechanic, but those games feel right. The controls is fast and easy, but on this game, it feels slow. I would suggest to use of a point-click system, it will up the game atleast a hundred-fold and I could excuse the outdated visuals because I know the game has a lot of potential. The crafting and hunting system alone makes you wanna play for long hours. The discovery of new tools and new way of surviving and even thriving, I'm talking about planting your own crops, making your hut or even a tiny village. That's the kind of game I wanna invest in and would definitely give it another go.\n\nPros:\n-Character Creation and Stats/Levelling System\n-Crafting System\n-Survival and Discovery\n-Prehistoric Setting\n-Sound is OK\n\n\nCons:\n-Visual and Art Style\n-CONTROLS\n-Tutorial System isn't helpful and  hard to follow for people with less patience.\n\nSuggestions:\n\n-Change controls to point-click system\n-Make the UI a lot larger\n-Make an interactive tutorial system where the game is stopped for a moment for you to actually follow the tutorial before you are placed in the game where the time is running.\n-Spice up the visuals a bit with some graphic overlays. Make the game look and feel like you are actually in a prehistoric era.\n-Multiplayer ( LAN/Online)\n\nKeep it up devs! As I've said the game has a lot of potential!=)","January 16","false","0.6"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","3"

The HUD is awful and is hard to understand. The graphics, obviously, are not great but acceptable. Sound effects are ok. I also couldn't make it to run in fullscreen\n\nThis game reminds me ARK: Survival Evolved, except you can't tame dinosaurs. Your objective is to SURVIVE.\nYou need water (and like in ARK you can drink rain water but you need to drink a lot or it won't fill your thirst bar), you have to eat and rest. I liked the fact that if you don't sleep (rest) your screen will blink and your sleep can be good or poor and that will affect you.\n\nYou can build things, carry weapons, throw and combine. You can use 2 rocks and a branch to start a fire or use the 2 rocks to sharp each other. You can check the item's information and see if some food is spoiled or not for example, eating spoiled food is bad for you.\n\nAs the game is a RPG you gan upgrade your skills and get more HP, stamina, melee damage, range damage, crafting and so on. When you are making your character you get some points to distribute, making the beginning of the game different for each player.\n\nWhile it lacks of content and get boring after a while (I didn't really like the cam, so it made difficult to enjoy the game) the game is good and has a lot of potential.

But if you want a finished game or want to wait for even more features then please hold of on this title, but if you are like me and enjoy the little the game currently has and believes the Dev's will add a lot more to expand this already great concept then by all means throw your $7.99 at it and support the Dev's.

You see the fog of humidity, the haze of heat, tunnel-vision from starvation. When raining you need shelter to stop yourself getting wet, if its sunny you need shade. Mountains provide cover from savage winds. It is neither too harsh to batter new players, nor too soft to allow a lazy attitude.\n\nIn most survival games that feeling of fear you get from trying to survive against something stronger than you eventually subsides as you find ways to counter the most dangerous aspects. In this they seem to persist. I woke up to a HUGE adult T-Rex twice as large as my hut, luckily chasing down some other dinner. They will virtually always be more powerful, and the ever changing environment constantly gives new challenges.\n\nThis is at a level ready for release, calling it 'early access' was probably unnecessary prudence on the designers part. Though it does happily give me confidence that they will continue to improve it.\nThe price is generous, the quality of this game should be made clearer on the store page.\n\nImprovements needed:\nThe tutorial was too wordy, all it needed was to say what the hotkeys were, so I needed to discover those myself.\nWalking is too slow & awkward.\nThe left/right click UI is fairly cumbersome, the icons too small to understand.\nConstruction is fairly advanced, though could be fleshed out some with more options. The time needed to collect materials is just right (for that construction level).\nWould be nice if the player could somehow influence the pooling of water (eg. digging lakes).","October 1, 2015","true","12.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

But the game is normal when in Window Mode. I am using a Windows 8.\n\nHonestly, this still needs LOTS of development. and I am actually afraid the Developer is just going to forget about this game sometime. (Which is my risk of buying this game day one.)\nSurvival Mode's attack mechanic is sometimes broken, which the game explains how to fix this problem if it appears. But of course, sometimes this fix doesn't exactly fix the Attack mechanic. I found myself thrown into survival mode, without the tutorial helping me very much either. I did have a few laughs, but Survival mode still needs LOTS of development.\n(Update) Survival mode's attack bug is fixed, as well, they finally added in medicine!\nGod Mode was an exciting idea to me, I personally am a BIG fan of God Games. However, as the game states, they still need to add ALOT to God Mode to actually do things. What you can currently do is. Adjust the Wind, Tempreture, Rain level, cast thunder, to kill, or burn down forests, and you can pick up things.\nAlso, there doesn't seem like alot of Dinosaurs in this game to really make it an interactive Ecosystem.\nGenerally, A single predator, and two defensive Herbivores. Also the AI for these things can be very... dumb. A T-rex was starving to death, with 30% Hunger, it was looking for food, and began to chase a Dinosaur like a mile away, when an injured, and nearby Dinosaur could have made a much easier target. Plus, after the T-rex chased the Dinosaur a mile away, it gave up, because it had 50% Energy, and died in it's sleep from Hunger.\n(UPDATE) T-rex's AI has been improved so it will go after injured, and more closer Dinosaurs.\n\n===What I want to see in the future===\n\n1.Omnivores. Hunt smaller Animals, and also eat Fruit/Plants.\n2.Mammals. Small Rats, or sorts of small mammals to populate the world.\n3.Scavangers. The T-rex can do this sometimes, but how about a small carniverious dino (I am sure there was one back in the day) who follows dying animals, and then eats there corpses.\n4.More Abilities in God Mode.\n5.More Items and mechanics, in Survival Mode.\n6. Multiplayer!\n7.Dino Mode, play as a Dinosaur!\n8. MOAR DINOSAURS!\n\n6/10 So far.

Thats pretty cool because you dont lose all the game process and it gives you time to learn and explore the map and game mechanics.\n\nYou build your owen character (you can choose ability points and hair color, skin color etc), a tutorial tells you how the controlls works and what you have to do. after that you can play and try to survive. its a bit like ARK: Survival Evolved where you start "naked" and where you have to fight agains Dinos. You can craft Items, Weapons and a lot of Stuff. Also you can collect fruit, there are trees who gives fruit only on the right seasons, for example the palms only on summer.\n\nImportent to know is, that you dont have an inventory in this game, at least not from the beginning, so if you like to build a weapon or a fireplace you need to collect the items and put them on one place where you can build. Your character has a zone and in this zone all items must be in, for example 10 stones to build a fireplace or a sharpe stone and a branch to build a stone axe, if this items are not in your zone you can`t build.\n\nMusic:\nin game you dont have much music and thats good, you only hear birds, the wind, rain and the water, its like beeing in the woods. Of course you have sounds when you fight or cut a tree but thats all.\n\nControlls:\nWell that was the hardest part for me, conrolls could be better but after you played a while you get used to it.\n\nGraphic:\nGame is in EA, as you can read there will be later HD graphics, for now you only have a simple 2D graphic and it looks like an older game, but its okay.\n\nBugs:\nI only had one bug when I started the game, I posted it on the community forum and dev fixed it realy fast. Now it works smooth for me and i didnt had any bug. its realy nice to see that this Devs care for his community and try to help.\n\nEnd Short Words:\nGive the Game a bit time to learn it and then you will have a lot of fun. There are different game mods and you can play on easy what gives you the option to save the game and reload when you died so you dont start again with level 0. Its still in EA but it seems that the Devs realy care for his community and time will show how great this game will be. For an EA its realy good and work smooth. Price is okay because you can realy spend a lot of hours playing this survival simulation game. And if you dont like the game you can still refunde your money if you didn´t played more then 2 hours.\n\nMore content will be addet later and HD graphics too also maybe linux and mac support.

I have several choice to arrange my stats, but I have no idea that how to do it. So the the game begins and...:\n\n• Day 1: It's Day 1 and OMG! I've survived from the a shipwreck and ended up in a strange and mysterious place. It's seems to be a nice place to live, since the place looks free of any threats, full of vegetation and fruits (early spring) and I free to roam. I go further exploring and find some giant dungs. I think "this place has some really big animals", when suddenly a youngster tyranosaur appears and well, I try to flee, really as fast as I can. Once I'm out of danger, I realize I don't have a place to sleep or to "live", so I look for any options the enviroment can give me to make a shelter, 'cause the night is falling, and it's about to rain...\n\n• Day 28: September 28th, daylight.

At the moment it is a bit limited, but it has hte potential to be a great game. You can choose between two starting mods; one with a random world you get thrown into, the other where to develop the world as a god and then create your player in. The challenge is real, there's a pretty steep  learning curve, especially if you choose the random world and are unlucky enough to spawn near a T-rex.\nThere is certainly a lot of room for improvement and expansion on what is currently available, but as an early access game it. At the moment the graphics, controls and tutorial aren't the best, but the first two are certainly going to be improved upon. It would be nice if the tutorial actually led new players through creating their first camp.\nThe game has a steep learning curve, you have to keep an eye on a number of stats, from nutrition to body condition, but once you get used to it it can be a lot of fun if you enjoy the type of game.","January 18","true","2.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Lucky for me, I love complex games.\nso some things i gathered up on the tutorial for your attention:\n- read all of it! it will help you a lot and I think I got all the concept of the game after finishing it.\n- the game is 2D top-down feature( I hateee 2D top-down feature and mostly don't even play games that have this feature) but they compensated for it with some scouting and freely moving wich is kinda good.\n- scout mode- you can see to kinda good distances while you scout but the further you see the denser it gets and if you look too far you can't see anything.\n- everyone knows the best way to kill stuff(dinos in this game) is going backwards and shooting/launching attacks. In this game when you go back you have a chance to stumble which makes the game a lot more survival like.\n- turning with A and D is hilarious idk why but i couldn't stop laughing while turning on the spot\n- really important - stop the game while on tutorial. I forgot to do it and got to day 3 when I finished it. Was little hard to get back to normal after that.\nNow its time to play the game itself.\nso i started up checked what i can build. very small amount of stuff that I could build was quite disappointed tbh.\nThere are a few kinds of dinosaurs most are herbivore some are carnivore. there's always a tyrannosaurus that will come to kill you on the first 2 weeks of the game even if you're on easy so be carefull.\nthe gameplay is nice, a little hard at first cause you don't know what the hell to do and where the hell is everything i need to build stuff so a quick tutorial:\n-reisn comes from tree(gathering 30+ has high chance of getting one on every second try)\n-wood comes from tree( hit it a few times with stone hatch)\n-leaves fly away so take me last\n-to build something you need to get all the components in the circle click on yourself and click craft\n-very important to build house first then a few walls\n-BE CAREFULL OF THE TYRANOSAURUSSSSS!!!!!!\noverall\nawesome game i totally will waste a few more tens of hours on this game\nreally addictive and hard(the good way)\nI give it 8/10!(only because its early access I'm sure after a while they'll release lots more things to build :D)\n","January 18","true","11.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kitxunei/recommended/373750/","kitxunei","Kitxunei","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kitxunei/","75 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDinoSystem is a top-down survival game with a lot of potential. Although it's currently only in Alpha, I still had fun playing it for a solid week or so. There are major improvements that need to be made before its final release, but it is shaping up to be very good.\n\nPROS:\n- In my very first playthrough a wildfire destroyed half the island, a T-Rex almost ate me, my home got turned into a desert after an intense summer drought, and I tried drinking seawater to survive before dying to a Troodon that I tried to kill as a last resort. 9/10\n\n- The "realistic survival mechanics" really have a lot of thought put into them. There are things like sun exposure, wind insulation, humidity, muscle soreness, etc. You need enough protein in your diet to be healthy, so you can't just get by on eating apples, you must go hunt fish or dinosaurs for meat. There are many small details to be aware of in order to survive optimally.\n\n- The entire ecosystem is "alive" - animals and plants live, reproduce, and die over time. Dinos never spawn randomly. You can choose to hunt babies for easy prey, but it can lead to the extinction of that species. It really makes you feel like you are part of an ecosystem.\n\n- Dino AI is interesting. There were some hard times when I came across a large kill and had to share it with Troodons, all of us too weak to risk fighting the other, all deciding to share the same kill.\n\n- The dev is still updating the game (one update per month at the least).\n\nCONS:\n- The controls kind of suck. You use WASD for a top-down. If you hit "T" ingame, you can switch it to "Mouse" turning mode which is decent, but it could be better. There are plenty of examples of top-down games out there with good controls. So hopefully this will be fixed by the final release. Also, I dislike the system for picking up/putting down items.\n\n- Items decay WAYYYYYY too quickly. This is my major gripe with this game. After just one playthrough, I felt annoyed by having to re-craft and repair everything almost constantly. Yes, the game is intended to be hard, but it can be made hard in other ways, ways that are not so repetitive and boring.\n\nIn Winter, I spent most of my time looking for leaves to repair my thatch. I'd get it fully repaired, go out to get food, and the next day it was time to collect more damn leaves cause hey the thatch was half-destroyed by the wind again. Yes I could keep a stockpile of extra leaves in my extra fire pit, but they would decay and disappear extremely quickly. Large rocks sometimes just break in your hands while you are trying start a fire with them or craft a weapon. One day I chopped down a tree, had to come back the next day because there was a lot of wood to carry, and most of the wood I left behind had already disappeared. Also, my axe broke after chopping down 1-2 trees. I collected some meat from a dinosaur carcass and it was spoiled after 2 days. It's not like you can keep killing dinosaurs all the time for meat, since you will run out of dinosaurs, so these things should really be preserved longer. Note: If you keep your items dry and away from sun exposure, they last a bit longer (but still not long enough in my opinion).\n\n- Your skill levels don't really seem to increase your skills by much. Related to the above issue - the game says that if you increase your "Crafting" skill, it increaes the final quality of the items you make. But at level 50 my things are still breaking left and right. Once I put Fishing skill to level 100, and it still sometimes took the whole day to get 1 fish (it's a matter of luck of course, but I feel that at max level your skills should feel stronger).\n\n- Jumping is glitchy and kind of useless\n\n- More work on the dino AI please. I never see the Trikes and Ankys try to fight back, they just run until they die. I want to see Trikes group up to protect their young. I want to see Troodons hunt in packs to take down larger prey. and more.\n\nNEUTRAL:\n- The graphics could be better, I wish dinosaurs had better animations and whatnot, wildfires look like a bunch of giant fireballs, and there are some spelling and grammar issues. But these are the last things that matter (and that's coming from an artist).\n\nOverall it's a fun dino survival game that is shaping up to have a lot of depth. Recommended.","June 5","true","24.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I think that if we can build multi-floor houses in this 2d - it would be innovative. Interestingmoment in game - that all resourses will not dissapear - like corpse of animal - it will decompose in present time , and leave skeleton after end of process.Also like a corpses - there is no respawns of animals - they will arise and grow from others. I find it funny and realistic, that can opens horizons for improvements game mechanics so far. Dinamic enviroment like pressure, warm, cold , humidity looks surprising, I can adapt for  the external enviroment and it cool. there is Also comes RPG elemnts- if i need to defend myself from animals - i need lvlup my musculature , if i need to know about animals - i need lvl up appropriate skills.\nFor Alpha version - this is a very good product at this stage.\nYou can buy it for half price to try this game - and i think you will be excited.","January 17","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The era of the dinosaurs. Now, although I see lots of flaws in this game, it has lots of room for improvement, and it’s only in its early access stage. I really think once the story mode gets released, that there’s no doubt that this game will see some success.\nTo start off, looking at reviews on steam of this game and reading the description, I knew this game would be enjoyable right from the beginning. I am also a big fan of survival games. On the other hand, I feel like if someone didn’t have an initial judgement of the game before starting it, that they would find the menu very unappealing. The game itself is not unappealing, but the start menu does not spark an interest in my eyes. I feel like it could use some music, or sound effects for when you scroll through each menu option, or even just a better layout.\nI started the game off with God mode and was immediately intrigued by the loading screen. You get to watch the world you will be playing in be generated right in front of your eyes! It gives you a real good idea on the size of the map. God Mode  really makes you feel like a “god”, giving you the ability to control the speed of time, the temperature, wind, and rain. You can also move plants and animals to give the map your own look and even creating surprising events (which will not be revealed to hide any spoilers). It also immediately stood out to me that there was no music in God Mode, and I was even more disappointed to find out there was no music in survival mode either. I really feel like music could be added to parts of the game to create more of an atmosphere as well as adding more intensity at certain parts.\nAnd now onto survival mode. What an interesting approach to a video game. I’ve always been a big fan of games that make you feel like you’re in the game, creating real simulation and intense realism. The game does a good job at this, giving you access to interact with everything. Before we get into the gameplay itself, let’s talk about the character gameplay. There isn’t much you can do as for character “looks” but there’s lots you can do as for skills. You can make your character muscular, or you can make him fat. You can make him have low stamina and high endurance, which can all be improved in the game. As for the gameplay itself, literally everything you see can be used to build and/or craft something.  Also the fact that the world in survival mode is randomly generated every time you start a new game creates for a different gameplay every time. The beginning tutorial also makes it extremely easy for first time players to get into the game and know what to do almost right away.\nAs for the graphics, they could use some work, but I don’t judge a game by its graphics therefore games with low-quality graphics don’t bother me. I just know many other people find low quality graphics unappealing so it’s always nice to have a game that looks good. There was also a few times where dinosaurs were disappearing, or going through certain things that I would have to go around. Although these are negative points, these are all small fixes that have no “game ruining” factor. Judging by the entirety of this game, the developers have all of my beliefs that this game will just get better and better.\nLastly, the sound effects. The sound designers did a great job with the sound production on this game. The sounds really help create an atmosphere. I got a really good kick at the animation and sound effects of when your character is shivering. The only that might be wrong with the sound effects is the birds chirping. I’m not sure if there were birds during the dinosaur era, but I may be completely wrong.\nAll in all, DinoSystem was a decent game. If you are fan of games in the survival genre, you might be interested in this one! The price is a little steep but I’m sure it will be well worth the money when it’s out of its early access stage and when the story mode gets added. I give this game a rating of 6 out of 10, but I feel like if I were to write a review for this game in another few months that my rating for the game would be higher. It still needs some work, but the developers have done a good job with the game already and I know the final job will be fantastic. I look forward to seeing what happens with this game in the future!\n","January 17","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really enjoy the fact that you can try to survive as long as possible in a world that is inhabited by dinosaurs. This game is very difficult to play and unless you use the mouse to turn your character then you will have a hard time making the character move. However if you use a good stratagy with the game you can gather enough items to survive and it is not only fun but keeps you anticipating you next move. You have to consider what you are going to do for your shelter, food, and to make sure that you are not eaten by that T-rex that is roaming around. The main problem with this game when you first start to play it is the fact that you do not have many items and it is hard to find a place where you can easily gather them without become lunchmeat first. If you are able to find a place where you can gather some items then you are able to survive for quiet some time and find a nice rhythm with the game. The game is slow paced and I would not recommend it for times when you do not have at least and hour or more to sit down and relax on a game. It is very easy to get pulled into this game for long periods of time.","January 31","true","15.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You aren't just some guy on an island with a million dinosaurs that respawn, you are 1 guy with a limited amount of dinosaurs. These dinosaurs will reproduce and make more dinosaurs, if you allow them, you can wipe out an entire species by stopping them from mating by either killing all males/females or just slaughtering them all.\n\nYou will have to use a crafting system similar to Stranded Deep since you have to carry or drag items over to you and then interact with them. You will have to be wary of different conditions since the game has a weather and climate system so you must adapt and fast.\n\nGod Mode\n\nIn God mode you are...Well God! You control the climate, weather and can even maniuplate object and animals by moving them. There isn't much to do but you can mess around by watching the dinosaurs live their lives or even create a character and hop in.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe game as of this review [23/12/2015] isn't entirely worth the asking price unless you really like this sort of thing, I would recommend you wait otherwise or check some videos to see if it interests you. The game has great potential and I hope this will become a prime example of why Early Access can be a great thing!\n\nEarly Access Rating - 8/10\nFull Release Expected Rating - 9/10\nFull Release Rating - N/A","December 23, 2015","true","0.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","3"

I guess that it depends from the person who watches it, i was the first to notice and comment how odd it is when you are playing "Spore" and you are dancing all around and then... an egg! Maybe something more realistic than dancing but less graphic than having a dinossaur having sex with another.\n\nPlaying this gameWhen i started playing this game i loved the idea of gathering materials for your survival or even hunt dinosaurs but i started to get bored after it. I liked other things, i spent so many time creating my character because it was brilliant the way i could choose things like my body fat and muscle. I loved the way that your level changes according to the actions you take. This kind of ideas made me want to play more, the sound is ok but the controls were not very nice.\nI did not have the patience to complete the tutorial and i was trying to not use this word to define this game but well.. it's ugly, it's very ugly. I don't want to see dinossaurs in top of each other in HD but i don't really want to play a game about a prehistoric era that looks prehistoric itself.\n\nHow about now?This is an early access review so keep working devs! I know you can make it all better. Multiplayer... change the controls to something else and improve the visual a little bit.\n\nI hope you could make it better so i will not be bored the next time.

Keep that in mind as you read my review. Also, seeing as the game is in early access, my review may change in further updates.\nThis is a game I've been following for awhile. My initial reaction was just how difficult the game was. My first fun experiences were realizing I could drink the rain water (and how the whole stomach system works) as well as starting my first fire. Of course, my first fire didn't last more than a few seconds, but that's the sort of "eureka" moment that makes survival games fun. Eventually I got a proper fire pit and made a fire that could last a little while and I took a nap. At this point, I don't have much insight on the game beyond that.\n\nIt seems really hard to learn anything or make progress. Some players may actually consider that a good thing, as the difficulty is part of the draw to a survival game. For me, it made me frustrated. Random t-rex encounters all the time even at the very first of the game were beyond frustrating. I found myself talking to the screen "oh, just kill me already!" when I'd get bitten early on. I later figured out that I could sneak, which did help with that a little bit.\n\nAll in all, it does seem like a good game, but it just needs more work. I can't recommend it at its current state.","January 25","false","1.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thehrony/recommended/373750/","thehrony","hrony","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thehrony/","268 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst of all, all the survival games are basically about the same - gather food and other resources, craft some tools and try not to get killed. What could make the difference and catches the gamer’s attention at first is definitely the graphics. And this is where developers of this game have a small upper hand. Why small you may ask? Or why the upper hand?\n\nIt’s because the game is 2D which makes it kinda unique between all of those survival games. Unfortunately, it’s not precisely brought to an end. Maybe they went for the look I’m going to describe but it just looked like they made a so-called HD remake that just looks and runs awful and makes you want to play that retro game yet again and forget that such remake even existed. I know it's hard for some indie developers to create a visually pleasing game but this genre and especially this game needs it. Let’s talk about gameplay now.. Tutorial. It's great for survival games to make an ACTUAL tutorial level where you simply cannot die half into it and then have to start from beggining. It’d be also nice if you could somehow make it completely new level, not like tutorial + an actual game at the same time. I know it seems like a good idea but this is why we have hints in-game, right? The tutorial needs to be an "extra" level where you easily retain all the food/resources/tools, and it definitely should not be long and boring. If that would be a thing, I can imagine having more fun with the game and actually knowing what the hell I am doing or am supposed to do. Let’s talk about the performance side for a bit. As I’ve slightly mentioned in the intro of this review, this game runs poorly. I honestly can imagine a low-end PC gamer looking at this game going like „Hey, this looks like a game that can work on my PC, yay!“ and then realising that it’s a miracle to run this game smoothly. I know that most of the survival games are not really optimised but that goes more for an online game than for a singleplayer game. Plus more for a 3D game than a 2D game. But even then, you can run the game on low settings with obviously low graphic, but at least not looking like a blurry potato. Unfortunately, this is not the case for DinoSystem. People expect a FPS wonderland from seemingly „small indie games“ like this. And this game unfortunately doesn’t deliver.\n\nPros + replay value\n+ bit of a character personalisation\n+ survival and "god" mode (needs some work though)\n\nCons - performance issues\n- visual side\n- tutorial\n- mediocre soundtrack\n- lacks more content\n\nOVERALL RATINGI would NOT recommend buying DinoSystem at this stage and at a full price. However, it's not the worst game I've ever played and it has a potential, so let's see if devs can deliver.","January 21","false","0.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","3"

The idea of a survival game with dinosaurs should appeal to all walks of life from kids to dinosaur fans to creationists and I love it. The graphics I also like because it reminds me of a SNES game but in a good way and is very cute. The sounds aren't bad. Watching the little dinosaurs scamper about and do dino stuff is also pretty fun.\n\nWhere it started to fall flat for me is the surviving it is hard for the sake of being hard. To make a fire you need rocks and twigs but it took forever for me to get it going because a) the interface/controls are awkward b) the rocks kept breaking and harvesting twigs is something you can FAIL at. It took me all game night and half the game day to get a fire going and then it rained it's like a survival game from the book of Job. When your character gets thirsty you need to drink which takes multiple keystrokes it took me a bit to find the water so my character was really thirsty so I had to interact with the water, select drink, watch him drink and then repeat over and over and over. Having solved the thirst problem I decided to try my luck at hunting a dinosaur where I then found out that my character swings an axe like he has cerebral palsy by the time my character swung the axe the dinosaur had moved in and hit me and then moved away. Okay no big deal maybe fighting dinos is something to come back to later? Fine better get some leaves and bandage up the dino damage...YOU CAN FAIL AT PICKING LEAVES!!!\n\nScrew it.\n\n\nThere is a diamond in here somewhere and if the game can get to where I think the developers want it to be it will be a hit. As it is right now buy in if you want to help fund the development but from what I can see they are a long way from the finish line and with Steam early access every game is a gamble whether the game gets finished or not.\n","March 7","false","0.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","3"

There are alot of english errors in this game but that is OK because the developer is not a primary English speaker and is looking for help translating and it can be easily overlooked as it is only a temporary issue. The game currently has very little in terms of gameplay but it is fun to mess with the island in Godmode. The weather system is dynamic and the dinosaurs react well to the weather.\n6/10","July 15, 2015","true","0.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

It has pros and cons just like every other game but in my opinion this game has more cons than pros, about 60/40. Pros: It is fun for a short time, the graphics are good, there is no lag, the structure is cool, the view is unique, and the concept is sweet. Cons: It is hard to play, the menu is kinda messy, it can get boring after a short amount of time, and some other stuff that I can't think of at the moment. Basically, the game is about a caveman(you) who has to survive in the forest and desert among the dinasours. It is a cool concept but it hasn't really met up with the potential that it has. I rate this game 5/10. It is definitely NOT for an everyday Joe Blo but it is for people like me who like to try all kinds of games and review them. This game is for people who like to "YOLO" or experiment with different types, genres, and creators of games. Like is said before, it is a fun game but it has potential and I could EASILY see this game living up to that potential...","January 21","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

" Early Access "\n\nTo be honest when I entered the game I was thinking at "Ark:Survival Evolved" & "Grand Theft Auto 2 ( Camera view & controls )"\n\nFrom the first few seconds in the menu of the game you realise that the "Developers" have a lot of work to the game .\nThe music(Sound) in the menu bring you in a state of wondering/fear/excitment .. but the bright color of the menu is not helping a lot . I would like to see a change there .\nI love a lot the customisation of the character ( even if you can see just from above ) the skin tone , muscle and body fat are nice to be there . The fact you need to keep in mind is that if you choose to change the " Metabolism & body muscle " of your character it will affect your " Health , Stamina , Breath , Speed & Jump " .\n\nThe gameplay is not bad but I just feel the need to know the storyline of the game .. I know the devs. are working on a storyline but none of the less I would like to see it implemented .\nYou can choose from Survival mode to God mode for now with difficulty Easy/Hard/Harcore and the weather season Autumn/Spring/Summer/Winter .\nI only played Survival mode and choosed easy cause you have the option to save your game and load at any time from that moment to continue exploring the island .\n\nThe music in the menu is awesome for the state that is brings you but once you start the game everything changes .. it`s quiet . You hear the sea , animals , birds and the sound of your running to get food and water or you are gonna die .\n\nThe controlls of your character , crafting menu and overall it may seem over the hand at the beginning but you get used with it really fast . ( I started the game with the idea that the control are gonna be similar to " Grand Theft Auto 2 " and I was not wrong .. If you enjoyed those games at that time .. this will be bringing back some memories !\n\nMy opinion is that you should get the game , try it for a few hours and then return to the store page and leave a review maybe even join the discussions and leave some opinions there ! You will enjoy the game if you like SURVIVAL , Dynos , Crafting.\n\nPROS:\n\nThe change of your metabolism depending on your "lifestyle"\nA lot of content for " Early Access " .\nSurvival & Crafting system\nCharacter customisation\nCustom generated map\nDynos Reproduction\n\nCONS:\n\nFull Screen is not working for me\nNo resolution settings ( Needs to be added )\nSteam Trading Cards\nUnable to use Controller ( The game would feel much friendly for the movement )\nLocal Co-Op\n","January 22","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
