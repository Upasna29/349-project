"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/351250/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Summary:Avalanche 2 is a roguelike platformer where you try to get as high as you can by climbing falling (Tetris) blocks. There's only one big level splitted into segments and most of the fun comes from the smartphone game style of quests - you always get three random tasks with a small reward. Those tasks are about collecting coins, climbing, "surfing" (climbing on blocks that haven't fallen on ground yet) etc. Also, there's a in-game shop where you can buy hats, upgrades and level segment skips (you don't have to start always from bottom).\n\nPositives:- Entertaining gameplay, offering hours of addictive fun for fans of roguelike genre.\n- Powerups will test your skill since some of those aren't just pure stat boosts, they may also change your controls (ex. bunny hop powerup).\n- Co-op mode.\n- Nice graphics style.\n\nNeutrals:- Some bosses are too easy.\n\nNegatives:- You might get bored fast if you don't like repeating the same level over and over.","December 18, 2015","true","5.5"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

I got this in a Humble Monthly, and have no idea why it is not more popular. I had no expectations going in. If you love some great platforming action with a fairly simple rule set, yet tons of awesome meta-game upgrades: this game is a must-have. Controller support makes this sooo much fun to play from the couch.\n\nEssentially, this is a tower-climb game. Blocks fall, and you make your way as high as you can go. There are powerups, and various enemies. There are banks where you can 'store' your money to spend on meta-game items (if you die, you lose it). There are shops along the way too. Oh! And there are quests that you can choose to do in between runs!\n\nPros:\n+Very addicting. The core game is quite simple in premise, but definately expertly implemented.\n+Great meta-game progression on this one (which I always like).\n+Cute music, graphics, and sound that really fit.\n\nCons:\n-You have to be into tower-climb games. Thats all I can think of. Comment more 'cons' in the comments, and I will rethink things.\n\nTotally worth ten bucks. Really fun game.","April 1","true","5.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpicySteam/recommended/351250/","SpicySteam","Soulja Boy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpicySteam/","113 products in account","I was a big fan of the original Avalanche flash game many many years ago, but as time went on and flash games went out of style, I forgot about the game entirely. Then when browsing steam, I all of a sudden came across its sequel, not knowing anything about it, and decided to try it on a whim.\n\nThis game is the definition of a perfect sequel. The core gameplay from the original game which made it fun is still the focal point, just improved, and every gripe I had with the first game has been fixed. The gameplay, which consists of going as high as possible, is addictive with missions and items keeping it fresh and interesting, even after the amount of time I've already spent on the game. You can tell there was a large focus on making the gameplay feel smooth. The controls feel very similar to the way super meatboy feels, which is to say good. The graphics and music compliment the game quite well, both being very well made and a pleasure to see/hear, and overall the presentation is great, with intuitive menus and nothing to bog you down between games.\n\nSome people may argue on the price point, which is a fair point to argue given the amount of breathtaking games on steam available for the same price, but as the guy's first game on steam I could see where he is coming from. I really enjoy it, so if you don't mind the price, or the game is on sale, I'd definitely recommend trying it out.","June 23, 2015","true","45.9"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","1"

I recommend it.\nI played the first flash game a ton and was stoked to be able to provide music for this sequel. Check it out!\n\nI am of course biased, but let me talk about some of the things I personally like about this game.\nThe core gameplay of Avalanche is still here, blocks fall and you climb as high as you can. Added in are enemies and different blocks that behave in various ways based on where you are in the world. There's also a huge arsenal of powerups you can grab that will change the way you climb. This is one of those games that feels brutal at first, but when you stick with it and beat that first boss, you suddenly start to feel your progress really kick in and you're richly rewarded with new sights all the way up.\n\nVisually entertaining, highly challenging. I've seen a lot of people really enjoy just watching others play this game as all sorts of crazy things can happen.","June 11, 2015","true","3.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kermamrek/recommended/351250/","kermamrek","Kerma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kermamrek/","289 products in account","I haven't played this game long, but i've gotten decently far and I can already say that this is an underrated gem.\n\nI was actually reluctant to buy this considering how little attention it was getting as silly as it sounds, because the trailer was trying too hard to do the adult swim anti-humour bit and didn't show too much gameplay. I thought since that only a total of 28 people have reviewed it (upon time of buying) that it was just a small forgettable indie game that didn't have much lasting appeal or grabbing power. I finally bought it on sale, yet I would recommend it full price.\n\nThe music and graphics for this game are the first thing that stand out- catchy and gorgeous. The gameplay's grasp on you as the player probably won't be immediate though... I started out the game frustrated and bored. The tutorial only gives you the basics (which is enough, although it doesn't have any music for some reason, making me worry the rest of the game would be just as silent) and after that you're thrown into the game, which is painfully slow to start off. The game will also be shockingly hard when you first start playing as well, making every death a "god damn it, do I really have to start over from the slow bit again?".\n\nThe gameplay summed up shortly: It's that one level from yoshi's island where you have to vertically climb a tower of falling blocks, only it's the entire game with much more depth. When you first start out, you will get squished. Many times. The lava will probably never kill you, because it starts out slow as molasses unless you get the risk badge. You will never be able to actually land on those damn birds that fly at you, and sometimes you might be able to sneak in a snake kill, but more often than not you'll miscalculate your jump and land right beside them, killing you instantly. Manage to get to the first boss? It will be a tedious test of patience until you finally start to do some risky moves, which will in turn make you end up dead and sending you down to the bottom again.\n\nYes, this game isn't a forgiving teacher. But don't hit that refund button just yet- it gets better. I got a hang of the game surprisingly fast, and it's secret amount of depth blindsided me. You'll start learning how to surf, and how to get combos to squeeze out as many coins as possible. You'll actually start to remember that the screen wraps and learn how to use it to your advantage. You'll learn how to kill the bosses quickly. You might even make it to space, or the moon once or twice.\n\nI do have some minor complaints with the game though, but nothing gamebreaking. Sometimes you can get an absolute terrible roll of RNG where blocks just do not stack at all how you want them to and it just never ends, making you die after a good run or make you restart at the beginning of one so you can actually progress. Walljumping feels responsive most of the times, but sometimes when you're trying to chain it, it's the most frustrating thing in the world. And for the love of god, I hate how shops work. I'm trying to run up away from the advancing wall of death and I accidentally jump on one of the shop chests, wasting my money. And if it's a deposit/withdrawl chest, I might hit my head on a ceiling and deposit multiple times. I would gladly rather press an action button to buy something than have to jump on it, even if it's some sort of badge that I have to equip to balance it out. Also, some challenges are lamely bugged, allowing you to cheat- the chest one in particular, you can just use a bank over and over to cheat it rather than actually get chests in one run.\n\nI'm not sure how long this game is before looping, and I'm not sure if the flash game was just as good as this, but I'd say those things aside it's absolutely worth your money. If you're on the fence, maybe wait on sale, but otherwise you won't regret full price.","December 23, 2015","true","1.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's suited for kids and adults alike, and even has a local co-op mode to increase the fun! I'll name several features of the game that you might want to know about.\n\nFirst off, your character is unique, you are a marshmallow called Marsh. As if that isn't cool enough, you can customize your character's outfit and starting items by unlocking items in the shop as you play. There's a load of achievements to get as well, and each achievement unlocks more items in the shop. Achievement-hunters will be pleased.\n\nGameplay is intuitive and highly addictive. It's got this 'just-one-more-time' feeling that many will enjoy. For those who like challenges, simply completing the game and doing the hardest missions will be difficult enough at first. Once you have that down, the next goal after that is to get as high up as possible to set a highscore!\nControls are intuitive and easy to grasp, but do not be fooled by the simple gameplay! There's loads of items to unlock and use, and the falling blocks and cute monsters will provide an exciting experience. There's few words to describe the feeling as you get higher than ever before, reaching just higher than last time!\n\nThe graphics are well-done and pretty cute, and they really enhance the feel of the game. The music also really fits the game very well and I enjoy listening to the soundtrack either on its own or when mixed in one of my chiptune playlists. I really can say that the soundtrack is top-notch and a good listen.\n\nI would really recommend this game to anyone who has even the slightest interest after seeing the video. Look up some gameplay on youtube or something, but I can REALLY recommend this game. It's fun, simple, and has local co-op. The fact that I put in 35 hours on this game already goes to show that despite how simple it looks, it's addictive and exciting.","June 19, 2015","true","1.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It is a very simple concept: blocks randomly fall down and you are supposed to climb as high as possible and not fall down into lava. It is very easy to pick up and takes a few hours to get good at it. This game is an excellent time killer. If you are listening to something in the background and/or have nothing better to do – this game is quite alright for just that.","April 23","true","9.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It will keep you coming back to try to beat your score, with plenty of interesting item combinations that keeps it fun, and can help you smash your old scores when you find out combos that work well for you. The game is so fast paced that sudden unexpected deaths can seem very frustrating at first, but as you unlock more upgrades and improve, you'll be able to avoid those situations and literally take your run to new heights. The developers are also quite active and are listening. They're already putting out an important update as it was requested by the fans, and are also considering adding a daily challenge system which would work very well for this game. To me, the price is well worth it for its current features alone, however if you're still on the fence about it, keep your eye out for this game to be on sale or for an announcement for daily challenges being added to the game.","July 4, 2015","true","18.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There's also enemies along the way, chests which can contain power ups or coins, and the bank (where you store or withdraw coins) or some shops (where you spend coins). There also seems to be customization for your mashmellow, which is always pretty amazing.\n\nGot it for $5 on sale and i definitely think that's a good price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crateboxer/recommended/351250/","crateboxer","CrateBoxer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crateboxer/","1141 products in account","Really didn't enjoy this one, for three key reasons\n\n1) It feels grindy. Upgrades and costumes are expensive enough that it takes a dozen runs to buy anything, and even then most of the upgrades you have to spend coins to activate them. The progression feels closer to a mobile game trying to get you to buy coins. If they wanted to make it so high scores wouldn't be affected by the purchasable upgrades, they should have just not had purchaseable upgrades. It's not a fun progression.\n\n2) Whatever random algorithm that makes the blocks fall is infuriating. I feel like the game would benefit greatly if, whenever it spawned a treasure chest or a mission or an enemy, it prevented blocks from falling over that space for X seconds. As it is, it feels like every interesting gimmick, good or bad, is crushed within a second of it appearing, which just isn't fun. My best runs I didn't go for any items or treasure, simply because when I did, 99% of the time a block would appear just offscreen and crush me with zero chance to react.\n\n3) The controls just feel wrong. I tried with a keyboard first, then a controller, and it felt floatly and difficult to handle no matter what. Over and over I was yelling at the collision detection, getting crushed by blocks I could swear I was clear of, or hitting an enemy with a jump that apparently was a low enough angle to kill me instead. And the worst was the walljump, which seemed to fire off at random times. I'd jump, hit the wall, and then immediately fly off without hitting the button again into an enemy or a brick.\n\nI'm only so-so on arcade games in general, but the biggest issue for me is that this is a platformer that doesn't feel good/fun to control. Upgrades are a matter of taste, but wonky controls and frustrating spawning put this as a firm not recommended from me.","April 3","false","0.9"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","1"

There is of course more to this game then just that. There are boss battles, items you can use, in-game currency you can buy things with (no microtransactions, which is always good), and more.\nThere is something about this game that keeps me returning to it, and I honestly don't know what it is. Is it the slightest chance that my next run won't be as bad as the one before? Is it the absolutely great music that plays past the second boss? I wouldn't know, but whatever it is, it is doing a great job of keeping me coming back.\nIf, however, you are still hesitant on picking this game up, make sure to give the free flash game a shot, this is pretty much like that, but a lot more fleshed out and polished: http://www.avalanchegame.org/","July 5, 2015","true","9.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/351250/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","A 2D Arcade Platformer, this game is extremely simple – you are a marshmallow-like blob who can jump (including wall jump).\n\nYour goal is to make your way up as high as you can.\n\nBlocks contstantly fall from above and pile up at the bottom of the screen. These blocks are of variable sizes, and can be jumped off of – but will squash you if they fall on your head.\n\nA rising tide of lava (and, later on, at higher elevations, stormclouds and eventually a sweeping laser) will pursue you upwards as well, meaning that you cannot fall too far behind the avalanche of blocks or else you will die.\n\nIn addition to the blocks, there are enemies. Some of these spawn on the blocks, such as leaping snakes and chickens (which can be killed by hopping on their heads), spiked blocks (which hurt you if you land on their heads, but can be pushed off), and super chickens (which spit rolling lava balls at you). Others can fly – there are birds which try to drop eggs on your head, flying squid which try to run into you, and dragons which spit fireballs at you. All of these can also be dispatched by hopping on their heads.\n\nTo help the player, there are chests which spawn as well. These chests can contain various powerups, which fill up red squares on the right hand side of the screen. At first, you can carry only one powerup, but as you acquire more of these squares during your climb, you can carry up to four. These powerups have highly variable abilities, from a pogo stick which makes you bounce continuously but lets you jump higher, to a teleporter which lets you go through solid objects, to ram’s horns which allow you to smash blocks above you by jumping into them twice as quickly, to a shield which absorbs multiple hits before breaking. Every time you are struck, you lose one powerup – and if you have no powerups, you die. Thus, powerups serve as a sort of life meter, and continuously collecting them (and losing them as you get hit by enemies) is a major part of the gameplay.\n\nThere are also “followers”, three static powerups which follow you around and allow you to move faster and jump higher. Each of these can be upgraded up to three times. In addition, there are green extra life mushrooms which totally aren’t ripped off from Super Mario Brothers (*cough*) which can also follow you around and allow you to respawn regardless of your method of death – you can even come back from being squashed by blocks or falling into the lava, which ordinarily kill you regardless of how many powerups you’re carrying!\n\nBreaking up the climb are various bosses at various set points. These give you a breather from the constant platforming, and are mostly very easy to beat – indeed, they are mostly welcome breaks from the much more intense platforming gameplay present while the avalanche of blocks is ongoing.\n\nClimbing up to 1800 feet allows you to confront the final boss, but to gain all the achievements you need to climb all the way to 3000 feet and confront several “double boss” fights, where two bosses from earlier in the game spawn at the same time and you must defeat them both.\n\nEvery time you die, you must start your climb over, but there are coins you collect over the course of the game which can be spent in a shop in order to give yourself permanent bonuses (or buy cosmetic items). These coins can allow you to start with various items, companions, or even alter the gameplay in various ways, such as increasing the rate of lava rise but doubling the number of coins which spawn. These coins can both be spent on in-game items during a climb in various shops which periodically spawn, or can be stored away in in-game banks and then spent on the out-of-game items.\n\nThere are also missions and quests which periodically drop from the sky in the form of scrolls; these missions and quests give the player coins and experience for grabbing them. Experience is used to unlock all the in-game items, while the coins are useful for the same reason as always.\n\nSo, given I have now explained EVERYTHING in the game, how IS it to play?\n\nThe reality is that it is a pure reflex platformer. While it starts off fairly slow-paced, by the time you’re trying to reach for the stars (and the last few achievements), massive numbers of blocks fall from above and huge numbers of dangerous enemies spawn constantly. The game is essentially a reflex-intensive 2D platformer with moving platforms at that point, and it is likely to take you 10 hours or so to 100% the game – and probably about half that to beat the final boss.\n\nUltimately, how much fun you have with this game is probably up to the kind of player you are. Do you like endless arcade-style games? Are you apt to be frustrated if your ten minute long session ends with you getting crushed below a block a hundred feet before your destination? Does a game which has no story or much variety or really much of anything but the pure straightforward platforming gameplay appeal to you?\n\nIn the end, I can’t say that I didn’t find this game interesting in a sense, but at the same time, I could never really shake a sense of cheapness – it feels like a glorified flash game. It is extremely simple, and there really isn’t much to it – it is just you trying to beat your high score and climb ever-higher in the avalanche.\n\nIf that sort of thing doesn’t appeal to you, you really probably don’t want to buy this game. If it does… well, maybe there’s something here for you.\n","April 9","false","11.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Yes, it's fun, addicting and keeps you coming back for more. If you've watched 10 seconds of footage of this game, you'll know what the game is about: jumping on top of falling blocks while avoiding enemies and a rising floor of lava.\n\nThis may sound tough, and it certainly is: while controls are decent, you're never really safe from being crushed. And with the blocks falling pretty randomly, some runs will be harder than others. The coins, treasures, power-ups, shops and banks really spice up the game. On the aesthetics, all is great as well: cute 16-bit era graphics and a great soundtrack.\n\nThe main disadvantage is the fact that this is a roguelike (or roguelite, if you will). You've only got one life and the coins you collect by climbing, achievements and banking serve to buy other items that will make future runs more doable. However, since a block can crush and instantly kill you roughly every moment, the boss battles are in a way the easier part of the game. And okay, the game is never boring and plays fast enough to have that "one more run!!!" feel, but in the end this game really only has one level.

I played the game on a weak laptop when I was around my parent's to kill time and it played well.\n\nAvalanche 2 feels like you're playing inside terris game played by an idiot. simple jumping mechanics, power-up and coin system. It also reminded me of Icy Tower I played as a kid, but instead of platforms the player moves on falling and stacking hollow squares. just like Icy Tower the players goal is to climb as high they can to set a record which then they have to beat, the game includes local and world scoreboard system.\n\nThe replayability lies in the custom shop, players can earn in-game coins which they can use to purchase cosmetics for their characters as well as other items like budges etc. I will critic the way they display the amount of coins you possess, if it was an intentional feature then it really sucks, the player can see how much coins they have on them while they play the game but inside the shop they can see their coin represented by visual colorful coins that give you no digits so you have to f**king guess how much you can afford... this ♥♥♥♥ is stupid as f**k.\n\nPlayers can stash their coins in banks that fall along with the squares, let me tell you the frustration you experience when a bank lands on your head before you stash your 50 coins. there are also shops that fall too, you can use your coins to purchase power-ups, watch out not to accidentally jump on wrong power-up or you will purchase unwanted item like a pogo stick (stay away from that sh*t). another frustrating things about the banks and shops is how you have to jump on chests to deposit/withdraw coins and purchase items as a block might fall on your head because your head will peek out if the shop's safe area.\n\ndespite other poor mechanics like jumping from grinding on walls, avalanche 2 is quite a fun game. i got the game from Humble Bundle monthly but if the game costs more than £/$3 ignore it unless you have a sh*t PC and want an easy to run game","May 10","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And with the blocks falling pretty randomly, some runs will be harder than others. The coins, treasures, power-ups, shops and banks really spice up the game. On the aesthetics, all is great as well: cute 16-bit era graphics and a great soundtrack.\n\nThe main disadvantage is the fact that this is a roguelike (or roguelite, if you will). You've only got one life and the coins you collect by climbing, achievements and banking serve to buy other items that will make future runs more doable. However, since a block can crush and instantly kill you roughly every moment, the boss battles are in a way the easier part of the game. And okay, the game is never boring and plays fast enough to have that "one more run!!!" feel, but in the end this game really only has one level. A good one, certainly...but I'm not sure how much I'd pay for it if I didn't got it in a humble bundle.","May 5","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved this game, even though I only have 3 hours as of posting this. The game is very fun, and you can try to beat the game in many different ways. For example, I love surfing on all of the blocks to be able to get to the boss platform, before it even touches the ground.","May 1","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a couple of platformer rogue lites out there but this is by far my favorite. Keep in mind Platformers are my favorite genre by far and rogue lites weigh in at second. With that eing said I thoroughly enjoyed Avalanche 2. The core mechanic of go up and live is persistent throughout the game and is solid at that. As you ascend you fight bosses, get stronger, and the common rogue lite progression. A definite positive is there are permanent unlocks for accomplishments as you can play, and that gives you something to strive for. On top of that you can get random missions, small goals to accomplish on runs, that will help spice up each run. If you are thinking of getting this game then do; it is definitely worth it.","May 29","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
