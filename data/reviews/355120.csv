Imagine that this is the only level. Imagine collectibles hidden in the fog. Imagine a fighter model whose point of rotation is not on the fighter, but on the follow cam. Imagine gamepad support that omits to support moving the camera with the right stick. Imagine a white HUD in a game that is mostly fog. Imagine a game that won't work if you access the settings screen. Imagine a complete lack of players on a multiplayer game.\n\nHave you imagined all this? Fine, then that saves you installing this embarassment of a game.","September 14, 2015","false","0.5"," 74 of 78 people (95%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","95","74","78","17","0"

I'm honestly surprised Steam hasn't pulled it.","September 15, 2015","false","0.3"," 52 of 53 people (98%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","98","52","53","6","6"

Almost unplayable and broken in its controls. There is nothing to do in it. Its nothing but 1 stage in a dome about 100 yds across. Total scam. Avoid at all costs.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Efreak/recommended/355120/","Efreak","Efreak Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Efreak/","1784 products in account","A poorly designed tower defense game.\n\nThere's no actual strategy involved\nToo difficult.\nNo keyboard control at all.\nCannot sell upgraded gun towers.\nNo fullscreen (you can maximize the window to get bars, but that's it)\nCan't click towers to sell/upgrade them (need to drag the upgrade/sell buttons onto the towers, wtf?)\nNo speed control (booooring)\nNo pause (not even when you go to the menu)\nFor some reason, game uses 4 processes on the computer instead of 1. Wat. -> this probably has something to do with the game being a nodejs application (it uses nw.js, the nw.pak and package.nw files are a dead giveaway).\npackage.nw (can be opened with standard archive tool such as 7zip) contains files that I haven't seen used anywhere, such as some boat sprites, upgrade costs, range/speed/etc buttons.\nNot sure, but I don't think it's likely (or even possible) to get a score below 3 stars unless you're not paying attention--either you get an easy 3 star win or it's too hard and you just lose. By the time you manage to create new towers, it's too late for them to destroy anything.\n- Exception: You can "win" the first level without placing any towers at all and 1 life remaining. You get 1 flashing star.\nBoats float over land\nAirplanes get stuck when there's a tower in their way\nThe game uses some kind of cd-key, but you have to turn off the overlay because the game's too buggy to let you open the overlay and dismiss the key message so you can see the game controls hidden behind it. (the sell/upgrade controls are down at the bottom right)\nOnly 3 kinds of towers, wat? Even the most basic flash games usually have at least 4 types right from the beginning.\nUgly low-resolution graphics. The backgrounds are blurry. The background PNG files are only 500x316px, and get stretched to whatever size your window is.\nTowers shoot at enemies that are offscreen\n- One of the maps requires placing towers at the bottom of the screen. Most enemies attacking from that location are destroyed before you can even see them.\nThe enemies don't match (ie, the boats are all wood, but the aircraft look sorta alien)\nWave counter is meaningless.  (see screenshot)\nThere's a giant skull shape at the middle bottom of the UI that looks like a button. It doesn't do anything. (see screenshot)\nOnscreen text is poorly placed; the money counter isn't centered vertically, and the wave counter text overlaps. Nothing is centered horizontally to its container--it appears to be using fixed-width containers placed in specific locations, with text aligned inside those.\n\nScreenshot showing fail: http://a.pomf.cat/ptowhn.png","May 7","false","2.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

How can a land-only base be threatened by boats? Well, by "flying boats" apparently...\n\nSmoke plumes sprout out of explosions that go off in odd, illogical directions. The drag-and-drop method of upgrading works fine before a fight, but works very much against you during active warfare (your visibility is obscured and sometimes the upgrade doesn't "take").\n\nHitting ESC is apparently supposed to pause the game but it doesn't (You see Resume/Quit options on-screen, but everything continues on in the background).\n\nBasically, this feels like an unfinished, over priced phone game. Even if everything were working fine, $4 is just too much for something this basic. If the price drops to $2 or less and the programmer addresses the glitches, it would work as an OK little time-waster.\n\nThumbs up only because the programmer is actually trying to address the issues after taking a beat-down in the reviews...","November 8, 2015","true","1.0"," 1 of 14 people (7%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","7","1","14","0","3"
