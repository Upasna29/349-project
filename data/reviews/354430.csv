I guess if you want to use the work arounds that even allow the game to run on any modern system it can be fine but what's the point.  I cant imagine using the included DOS version with no voice.  The included 98 version will 100% refuse to run on anything from Windows 7 to Windows 10 unless you modify the game yourself with assorted DLL files.  However doing this will cause multiple graphic problems, kill the in game music and cause mouse duplication in some cases - well it did in mine.\n\nJust by looking in the discussion forum and in the threads, its painful to see how little (read: none) support is given from the people who are actually selling the game and taking your hard earned money.  Ultimately I cannot recommend this on a purely technical level - I cant imagine veterans wanting to have the nostalgia ruined by this technical mess and I cannot fathom anyone new to the series to even dare try this for the first time.\n\nTo end, this is also a statement on Steams quality control - all games really should be tested on basic operating systems and if you try to sell a game from 1993/1998 and it doesnt run, or even guarenteed to run, on a modern system of anything in the last 5 years please explicitly say this in the memos.  I am thankful for Steam refunds, I'm sad that the chance was not worth it - I will instead be happy with the memory of the hundreds of hours I put into this game and series instead.","January 4","false","0.1"," 61 of 87 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","61","87","0","4"

Thank you that these games are finally on STEAM.\n\nWhen I saw these games are available on Steam it was an instant buy for me. I am a STAR WARS fan since I first saw the movies on video tape back in the day when I was a child and life was sooo cool. Well not so cool if one of your floppy disks have reading errors and you cannot install your version of X-Wing anymore. OK enough talking about the past but this game is still a blast!!\n\nWhat I like is that they not even give you the original classic DOS version, the remastered version with higher resolution and new textures is also included in this package. The sounds are great like in the movie. The screaming of the TIE Fighters give me goosebumps and the digitized speech is just sooo oldschool you´re gonna love this game. The classic version which runs in DOSBOX has been configured very good so you don´t need to edit the config files or DOSBOX settings for this one.\n\nIf you never heard of these games before it could be a bit difficult to get on with these games because they´re  not just action games they are simulators. So it needs a bit of training to win your first battles but if you win it is just a great feeling.\n\nOh yeah before I forget the upgrade kit and the mission disk B-Wing both are included in this package too. So go ahead and click it!\n\nIf you like my reviews please visit my profile leave a comment or just simply add me as a friend.\n\nHave a good time :shelterfox:","May 3, 2015","true","11.4"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","25","27","3","0"

This is one of my all time favorite games.  This version includes the classic Floppy disk version and the remastered windows 95 edition.  The Collectors edition CD-Rom is missing from this version.  also missing is the Strategy guide, but half the fun of this game is how brutally hard it can be.  I reccomend this game, but not the Steam implementation of it because of the bugs.\n\nThe remasterd version included has better graphics than the "classic" version, but is limited to only working with a joystick or gamepad (I'm using a logitech F310 USB).  this version has problems making it mostly unplayable because of the ghost cursor.  Forum posts about this issue don't help to resolve it, version purchased elsewhere doesn't have these problems.\n\nThe classic version works just fine including workign with my gamepad. There is not a way to customize the joystick layout in this version.  you can get some pretty good scaling if you aren't afraid of editing the dosbox configuration file in the classic folder.  just remember this version was designed for 300x200 resolution and won't look great stretched to 16:9 at 1920x1080.  This version can be played using the keyboard and mouse and even with the gamepad you have to use the keyboard for so many of the functions anyway that it might play better with a keyboard and mouse.","May 2, 2015","false","0.2"," 35 of 47 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","35","47","0","0"

New to the game players should have little problem involving themselves in the game. The inability to use a throttle slider is a bit annoying--but simply demands a bit more ability to multi-task.

The older graphics do not rob the game of its playability, and for the old-school gamer (or those lucky enough to cut their teeth on gaming in the early 1990s), it will remind them of the days when it was about the mission, and the need to think of how to play the game, instead of the flashy visuals that dominate today's games.\n\nEnjoy it for what it is.\n\nAnd for those who have played it through, and want something a bit different, get X-ED, Dos Box, and modify and create your own missions (because having three or four Star Destorys battle it out with the same number of Mon Cal cruisers is a beautiful thing to weave your X-Wing through).","May 10, 2015","true","10.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fortheussr/recommended/354430/","fortheussr","chairbender","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fortheussr/","342 products in account","I played a little of the supposedly superior collector's edition, which is not included with this, and I actually found I preferred the special edition that comes in this steam version with its 3d graphics, joystick mapping support, and music (vs the midi music).\n\nNow, as far as gameplay, my main complaint with this game is the difficulty spikes and ensuing frustration. I was going to give this a negative review after getting stuck on one of the stages, but I eventually figured out a trick to overcome it. The difficulty spikes wouldn't be a problem if there was some way to lower the difficulty while still enjoying the story, but there isn't. You can turn on cheats, but it won't let you progress in the game. In addition, some of the levels have moments where you're sitting around doing nothing. There's a lot less of these moments in the later X Wing series games. That can be particularly frustrating when the hard part of the stage is towards the end, meaning you have to sit there playing the same easy part over and over and spend a bunch of time waiting. Anyway, if you aren't willing to put up with some occasionally stupid levels, I would not recommend this.\n\nIt's not just that, though. Even if you have a joystick, you'll be lucky if you can get rolling to work. This is actually really important to be able to use in some of the later stages and I couldn't get it to work. I'm not sure how it's supposed to be mapped because there isn't an option for roll in the joystick settings. Overall, the joystick support is a real hassle but the game doesn't really work as well on a mouse or controller.\n\nOn the positive side, for being such an old game, it's highly immersive. I actually think this is the advantage of the 3d and the actual music as opposed to the midi soundtrack (and, overall, the updated engine). It reminds me of the level of immersion and attention to detail you can find in the other awesome star wars game, Republic Commando. It's satisfying to master using your laser to hit moving targets, and the visuals and sound help make it that much more gratifying when you successfully take out a ship.\n\nSo, if you're looking to only play one really fun game in the series, I would look at the other X wing games. However, if you are willing to put up with some frustration in the pursuit of experiencing the whole series, definitely don't be afraid of playing this one. I haven't played it with keyboard or 360 controller, I only played this with my joystick. I would probably not recommend this game if you don't have a decent joystick.\n\nBut, overall, I wouldn't recommend this due to the frustration, lack of options for easing up the difficulty, poor joystick configuration capability, and the fact that you can get the same game with the extra collector's edition on GOG for the same price.","June 9, 2015","false","7.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

My computer couldn't run X-Wing, and our Allied disc of C&C: Red Alert broke, so I was stuck playing as the bad guys (the Soviets, and TIE Fighter). Then, a wonderful thing happened, the Special Edition of X-Wing and TIE Fighter came out in a single box, and I had to get it, and I found X-Wing to be rather disappointing. Don't get me wrong, I'm proud to fly for the Rebel Alliance, but X-Wing lacks features that TIE Fighter and later games included:\n\n-The in-flight map is only two-dimensional.\n-The targeting display is just a diagram instead of a 3D model.\n-There are no in-flight messages, save mission-critical stuff.\n-The Q-Spacebar method of ending missions isn't here.\n\nBut the biggest surprise is that this game is HARD. In order to get a training patch, you must complete 8 levels to earn a Flight Badge, which is no small feat. In the Tours of Duty, dying will get you demoted to the bottom rank, and you can expect to die a lot. Even when it came time for the Death Star Trench Run, there's so much junk and turets in the trench that I was torn to shreds like wet tissue paper. The only strategy I found to work was to flight some 20 km away from the nav buoy (and hope it's the right direction) and fly straight down, hoping I hit the exhaust port.\n\nHowever, the game doesn't end there, taking you through 2 more tours, ending with the founding of the Hoth base, which gives you the impression that it's a long time between A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back.\n\nIn the end, if you're up for a challenge, or really want to be a Rebel like I did, go for it. If not, play the better games in this series.","April 30, 2015","false","0.7"," 7 of 26 people (27%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","27","7","26","3","0"

I think it required something like 7 to 10 floppy disks to work. Unfortunately, I think a file became corrupt. After installing the game, the graphics would get distored to the point where the game was glitching all the time. It wasn't until the collectors edition that came in the X-Wing Trilogy that was released back in 2000 that I got a chance to get it back. It's nice to have these games working in Windows 10.\n\nThere is one urk I found. These are the joysticks/gamepads I own:\nLogitech Attack 3\nXBOX 360 Wireless\nLogitech Gamepad F310\nI tried all of these controllers as my X-Wing was running into the proving ground platforms. It's not until I went into the Game Controller settings (in Windows) where I could configure my controller that I figured out what I could do. I selected "Advanced" and got the option of selecting a particular game controller to work with older games. I tried it with both the Attack and the F310. The option allowed both game controllers to work in X-Wing. So, if you have problems getting it to work, try this (at least for WIndows 10).\n\nEdit: The XBOX controller might work with the game after all. I turned it on and it became a third option under "Advanced". As such, seeing as how it disappears from the settings whenever it goes to sleep, I would not advise using that particular controller (or any controller that can sleep) with X-Wing.","May 9","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is the first in a series of four games and therefore had basically all of the growing pains; the worst game engine, a story much worse than its follow up (TIE Fighter), a less than intuitive menu UI (I personally don't think this was fixed until the third game; X-Wing vs TIE Fighter), but... it's still a very fun game. The story goes from just after the first death star was nocked out on until Hoth and it's an enjoyable ride.\n\nMy recommendation is to use the Collector's CD-ROM version which uses the game engine from TIE Fighter instead of the less than great original one; same as with TIE Fighter there is a MIDI based soundtrack that adjusts to recent events. Enemy reinforcements arrived? Scary music. Dogfight? Exciting music. Just took out a TIE Interceptor? Uplifting music that fades back to the exciting music because you're still in a damned dogfight. It's great, though it is graphically inferior to the Remastered edition that uses a version of the X-Wing vs Tie Fighter Engine and the accompanying increased graphical improvements. The Collector's CD-ROM version also has great voice overs though it suffers from the low bit rate it was obviously recorded at.\n\nLong story short: Collector's CD-ROM is the best. Remastered is prettier but misses out on some neat features. Classic is bleh (it's basically a prototype to build up to making the TIE Fighter engine and game).\n\nTechnical Side notes:\n\nThere is an XWA wrapper required to get the Remastered version working 100% correctly and a launch option of -softwarecursor must be set as well. https://github.com/rdoeffinger/xwa_ddraw_d3d11/releases/latest just paste it in your remastered folder for X-Wing.\n\nYou may have to fiddle with some DOSbox settings for some of the versions to get the correct sized window or what have you but it isn't anything particularly complicated. A good 4:3 window size I like to use is 960x720.\n\nIf you have issues with the initial screen doing the joystick calibration on launch; alt+c during a mission or training will launch the in engine calibration and you can do it then.","May 10","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

IMHO.\n\nJust been replaying it for the first time in over 22 years and seems just as fun as it was when first release.  A bit rough round the edges - other posts will testify to the advancements made in the genre since - but the playability and challenge is still there.\n\nLack of clarity around mission goal completion is probably the biggest single drawback but other than that its lots of fun.","May 21","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After putting in 30+ hours, its a thumbs down.  This game in its current condition is not to be played on modern machines.  It works on win10 with no problems.  There is an excellent group out there who is working tirelessly on 3D acceleration and the game looks marvelous.  But I fear all of their work will be ultimately to no good.\n\nTwo reasons.  1) This game is meant to be played with a stick.  I hate mousers who play flight/space sims with a first person point-of-view.  You're missing the part of the realness.  But it can be played with a mouse.  But, if you're a mouser, stop reading now.  Vintage X-wing players and those who use a stick will find a massive deadzone on both stick axes.  The deadzone is so bad, I and barely maintain a torpedo lock.  The is stick is going everywhere.  To me, a game is not fun if it cant be easily navigated.  And its not fun.  2) With modern machines, I suspect that this old code is processed much faster than the 386 PC I used to run the game on.  The ships don't move faster, but they move more efficiently.  The TIEs, even on early missions juke around like experts as soon as they are lined up in the crosshairs.  Of course, coupled with a bad deadzone issue, TIEs are almost impossible to hit in time sensitive, ship guarding missions like Tour of Duty 1 mission 7.  I did find that the deadzone on the Collector's CD version is better but its at 320 x 200 resolution.  My eyes were crying adjusting to that rez.\n\nI hate that I cant finish this one but maybe TIE fighter's engine is a little better with the deadzone issue.  It'd be nice if Disney do a real update on this game or at least support the community in really fixing it.  At this point, I feel Disney when for a money grab on the elderly (us who are older now and wanted a piece of nostalgia).  But I did get it in a bundle.  Ha!Ha! Disney.\n\n=================================================================\nThis is not the X-Wing Trilogy edition with all the updated graphics.  This more like the first compilation, the Collector's  CD edition.  This uses the updated TIE Fighter engine.  However, most importantly,  it has all the expansions.\n\nI bought this game on day one, along with TIE fighter and all expansions back in the day.  I still have it on 3 1/2 inch floppies and was elated when steam brought it over.  In my opinion, it was better than Wing Commander at the time.\n\nI briefly jumped in to see if all components were working.  And they do.  It loads and plays well on Win 7.  DONOT select 640x480 hardware option.  Again, all of the expansions are present.  Play it long enough and you'll get used to the 640x480 graphics.  I promise you it will be worth it.  It will be a good time passer until star citizen gets up and running.  The only complaint is....where is the manual?!?  This game has A LOT of keystrokes.  At least post a reference card, sheesh!!\n\nWell I'm off to shoot down some TIEs.  May the force be with you.\n\nEdit 1: Found the manual in the install folder :)","April 29, 2015","false","36.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
