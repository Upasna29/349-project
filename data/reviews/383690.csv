I recommend this game to people the enjoy puzzle games and visual novel style games.\n\nConstructive criticism:\nI think there is a missed opportunity to support dual monitors.","October 24, 2015","true","4.1"," 79 of 87 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","79","87","4","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DasMehdi/recommended/383690/","DasMehdi","Mehdi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DasMehdi/","735 products in account","I am a software engineer and a gamer, so this game immediately became a 'must buy' for me. Having played through the first two episodes (can't wait for the third),  I can say that this may be the best hacking game I have ever played.\n\nThe game really does make you feel like a hacker, as you're dropped onto a linux-like environment with a terminal and desktop. All while you have a really sweet electronic music playing as a part the games sound track. If you wanted to feel like Neo, this game is the one.\n\nThe puzzles are really sweet. Why? The game forces you to use "outside resources" to solve some of the puzzles - ie: using google maps, searching wikipedia to figure out musical notes, all to deconstruct a timed puzzle. Oh, and yes, the puzzles had me streaming all kinds of profanities at times - a good sigh the puzzles are well made.\n\nUnlike other hacking games, this one is fully voiced. THANK YOU.\n\nThe graphics are clean, minimalist and sharp. Exactly the right combo for this sort of game.\n\nThere is a 'good' story for what it is, and the cliff hangers after each episode have me yearning for more.\n\nBuy this, even if you're only mildly interested in the subject of computers, or if you're just into puzzles. Even if you think the game might feel a bit to challenging, because each puzzle solved is rewarded with an amazing sense of joy.","November 6, 2015","true","3.9"," 40 of 41 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","40","41","0","0"

The terminal is where I live. So when I read that we'd be using "actual Linux commands" to solve hacking puzzles, I wouldn't click buy fast enough. Unfortunately, "actual Linux commands" essentially meant ultra stripped-down versions of ls, cat, ssh and sometimes sudo.\n\nThe puzzles themselves were decently creative, but way too simple. About 90% of the puzzles could be solved with some variation on the form (1) read the emails for clues then (2) type in the password to unlock the username / password for the next computer . About half the puzzles require a simple Google search which seemed cool about twice before it got annoying. Overall, the puzzle aspect felt formulaic and underdeveloped.\n\nSome nice work went into writing the emails between the office workers and I enjoyed getting to know the story through that device. Everything from the story/atmosphere perspective was VERY solid.\n\nI think there's a ton of potential in this type of game, especially for teaching people about how to use Linux. It just needs more work to make people really have to work to solve the puzzles. Codesleuthing is tons of fun, but it just doesn't feel fair when your puzzle is as simple as translating morse code or maritime signal flags. Also, there's no reason this game shouldn't have had a better terminal emulator. More terminal options would have meant more complex and satisfying puzzles.\n\nOverall, it's a fun diversion for a couple hours, but that's about it. It definitely isn't $9 of entertainment. I think this developer is definitely on the right track and I look forward to their next release, but this game can easily be skipped.","October 24, 2015","false","3.3"," 68 of 90 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","68","90","0","6"

I definitely want more games like this.\nAnd to clarify this version of the game has the first and second episode of MuComplex that where previously on kongregate.\nI do not know how a possible release of a third episode might be handled.\n\nAs much as I love the game, the way the steam release has been handled was pretty bad. The free version was shut down without much prior warning and for the way the port was done its a bit expensive.\n\nAbout the Port:\nIt's basically still the same game as before. to my current knowledge only 2 things were added(hints that unlock after a certain time and some additional puzzle after beating both episodes) No gamechanging fetures were added. They even removed something substantial(ctrl+v) which made one of the puzzles difficult to solve.\nSome features that could definitely not have hurt to add would be to make the terminal resizeable, allow you to open more than just one picture and let you resize and move those freely on the screen. Also there are no game options of any kind, you just get a small button to turn the complete audio on or off. It's pretty disappointing.\n\n\nAt last some praise:\n*love the concept\n*voice acting is kinda ok\n*the end of episode 2 has a nice little cgi cutscene\n*there are a lot of emails that are not necessary for puzzle solving, they add a nice atmosphere to the game and let you look into the workings of the mu complex","October 24, 2015","true","5.3"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","6"

Mu Complex had me searching through Twitter, to scrolling through different color's hex code, to scratching my head while trying my best to decipher vigenere-- it has been quite a ride.\n\nYes, this game  has nothing to do with real hacking, the most advanced "hacking" you'll ever be doing in this game is reading through emails to find hints of another computer's password, but it's very much worth it. I've played this other game on mobile called Hack Run the other day, and this game is very similar to that as well. I love both games quite a lot :)\n\nI admit that I bought this game on impulse just by looking at screenshots, but this has been one of the best impulse-purchases i've made in a while.\n\nEdit: At the time as I wrote this, I had no idea Hack Run + Hack Run Zero was on Steam xD","February 8","true","13.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This... is a completely different thing. It's more a series of stale, extremely simple puzzles or mini-games that you just have to complete to progress.\nMu complex also tries to use clever "real life" puzzles - which would be interesting if this genre hadn't existed for more than a decade (see Ouverture Facile for instance).\n\nIn addition the story is not only boring, it's also infuriating. You can see the twist coming from a mile away - hours before finishing the main game. Yes this means there is a post game. I didn't finish it. It started feeling like a grind. The thing is : cracking codes can be fun, but most of what Mu Complex asks of you is not to crack the code, it's to apply the formula. It's not enticing.\n\nSo what's left? There is no real music - just background atmospheric. It becomes agravating fairly quickly. The UI then? Yeah the UI is pretty good. It works, it looks slick and it's appropriate and functional. However the controls (typing really) are not. It feels very frustrating to have the commands available to you change on every single stage (computer), spelling out the answer for you. What made you feel clever in a game like HackNET was figuring out what to do with all these tools you accumulated. Nothing of that challenge here - we give you only what you need so that you're not lost.\n\nI wanted to love that game, I really did. We don't get enough hacking games and these can be so fun. But a hacking game this is not. This is a series of mediocre puzzles, under a decent looking coat. There's definitely potential, but it's not there yet.","February 20","false","4.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
