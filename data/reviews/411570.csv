"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_tokidoki_ai/recommended/411570/","_tokidoki_ai","Talon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_tokidoki_ai/","351 products in account","TL;DR: If you are a hardcore fan of the series and need another CYOA game to play through, I would grudgingly recommend it. While not necessarily compelling, the story is adequate and the writing is good. However, if you are just starting the choice of games series or are considering this because of the zombie narrative I would recommend against playing it. If you are interested in a long CYOA game, try tin star instead. A+ narrative and gameplay, and much more replayability.\n\nI'll preface this review by saying I've played every choice of games that has been released on steam and I have loved each and every one of them. Zombie exodus is a solid choose your own adventure game, in the same vein as all of their previous releases. However, I am sad to say that I don't recommend this game.\n\nAt first glance, the game seems to have everything I love in it. Zombie apocalpyse, variety of characters to befriend or betray, and a decent selection of starting "classes". Yet as I read through it, I became increasingly dissatisfied with the choices. Before each mission, you have the option to take a variety of weapons with you. However, I soon realized that the weapons you choose, aside from the various utility options, have absolutely no impact on the story. The shotgun, pistol, rifle, AK, etc. all lead to the same result as did the melee weapons. While the flavor text changed, the outcomes remained the same. I would have preferred it if the weapons you choose had an impact on your progression. Also the fact that you apparently have an unlimited amount of each made the trading aspect worthless, as you didn't need to consider the consequences of trading away an AK or rifle for medicine. When you got to the next mission, you'd once again have everything you traded away.\n\nThat alone wouldn't be enough for me to not recommend the story though, as the writing was solid and my favorable predisposition towards choice of games and zombie games in general kept me interested. However, the character relationships also left much to be desired. Even if someone in the group hates you (low disposition score) they would still come to your aid in discussions or battles and essentially nothing changed between low and high disposition scores. This made the relationships in the game seem meaningless. I mean, why have those stats if it doesn't change any of the outcomes?\n\nFinally, (slight spoliers) were the ghost scenes. I am fine with suspending disbelief for the zombie apocalypse, but given that the nature of the disease was viral, it seems counterproductive towards the environment of the game to have supernatural elements in it. These scenes didn't really add anything to the story and in my opinion, weakened its narrative.\n\nBy the time I reached act V of the story, I found myself bored and unimpressed. A choose your own adventure story that is essentially without graphics (some sketches were present) and music needs a compelling narrative and meaningful choices in order to be effective. Without it, it begins to bog down. And sadly, this game did exactly that.","October 25, 2015","false","2.4"," 129 of 172 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","129","172","2","20"

People believe that this isn't considered a "game". If you don't like reading text-based games than this isn't for you. This is my favorite one from the rest of the Choice of Games. So many endings means more playing for me. I am going to add more stuff now because I've played this game enough to say more.\n\nPros:\n+ Able to save some people from dieing (of course not everyone can live)\n+ Hidden weapons\n+ Gay relationships ;) (Ooooohh yeaahhhh)\n+ A lot of endings that some are easy/hard to achieve\n+ Choose your job (This helps with some endings)\n+ Choosing the right weapons that can save you from death (I'll come back to this in cons)\n+ Stats will sometimes prevent you from choosing certain actions, which is good\n\nCons:\n- Most of your missions require you to bring weapons, but it doesn't matter\n- Trading weapons/food doesn't matter because you'll gain them back\n- Relationships have little effect (Being hated by others, but will still follow you)\n- Little to no illustrations later on\n- Some decisions don't have a big impact\n- Girlfriends/Boyfriends will mostly leave you heartbroken (Oooooohhhh noooooo)\n\nIn Conclusion I'm deciding if I should do all achievements. Again, this is a text-based game. If you don't like that than you shouldn't buy this. This game is great to kill time. Finally,  I recommend  buying this game.","October 24, 2015","true","24.3"," 42 of 58 people (72%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","72","42","58","6","0"

The first is the excellent Choice of Robots. So you can imagine I would compare ZE with CoR.\n\nUnlike CoR has branching stories, ZE is a linear story. In ZE, choices you make impact on how you do things. More like traditional CYOA book, you either success or die (and load save) and proceed to the same next storyline. e.g. In one senario, if you are captured, it is game over instead of branching. <- It is a shame the writer didn't add the captued senario, I don't mind if still leads to the same next part.\n\nStates do not seem matter much. Compare to CoR where states are very important that it unlocks new branches, again ZE is either-you-die-or-make-it so just die and load and proceed.\n\nMinor issues:\nTransitions between scenes sometimes are not smooth.\nBurrowed few ideas from Walking Dead so some senario can be a bit predictable but which zombie story wouldn't. :P\n\nPS\nThe review was initially negative out of the pricing & my personal preference of game/story design, now I have learnt that it is possible to play on their website too even I bought on Steam and played more with better understanding of the game, I switched from No to Yes.","October 24, 2015","true","16.4"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","15","24","2","5"

It's cool that when you pick your profession you get special choices unlocked and sometimes they will benefit you greatly. The zombie action is satisfatory, the other survivors have fairly interesting backgrounds and personalities, and I'm glad the feature to return to a previous save is an option. Many CYOA games do not have this option, so if you take a wrong turn somewhere and end up getting eaten by a zombie then it's okay and you can try it again differently!\n\nNow for the few complaints I have:\n-The ending was a bit unsatisfactory\n-The "romance" relationships seemed a little rushed\n-Some unexplained parts in the story, a few loose ends that never really got tied up (whether that was my own fault for certain choices I made or just a flaw in the writing, I cannot say)\n\nOther than those few issues I had, I really enjoyed the game.

Now, I, as well as many others, steer clear of text based games due to them not being as fun as other games, however I was genuinely surprised by how well this game was done. The decisions in this rival those in Telltale's The Walking Dead, and you really do have to make hard decisions. Unlike Telltale's The Walking Dead, this game has 9 possible endings, many character's survival relies solely on your decisions, and your decisions REALLY DO MATTER.\n\nThe game starts off quite slow, but quickly builds up to life in a world full of zombies, bandits, and other dangers coming from every angle.\n\nI rate this game at 9/10, and the reasons it doesn't get 10/10 are listed below:\n\n1. A couple of plot points don't get resolved (depending on which ending you get). Some pretty major things happen towards the end of the game, and depending on your choices, you may or may not find out what happens/happened. I know it counts towards the realism, but when someone betrays you, and you never find out who, or when someone stays behind, and you never find out if they live or not, it kinda feels like the loose ends needed wrapping up.\n\n2. A lot of the decisions come down to "Pick the smart option". This is something I like. However there is one point where the writer trades in the "Zombie survival" element for an Indiana Jones-style action sequence.\n\n3. The epilogue is kinda rushed and forced. I got an ending with 9 survivors, and then the game wrapped up with 5 pages set 5 years later telling me how each of them died randomly, and gave a lot of information that wasn't needed. It's kinda like if you watched the first 5 seasons of The Walking Dead, and then had everything past that summarised in 10 pages at the end of the season 5 finale. I would've much rather had a sequel, or DLC (which is something I don't say often).\n\nAll in all, this game was highly enjoyable, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys Zombie stories, or interactive story and character driven games.","November 4, 2015","true","30.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The romances can get rather cluncky and mesh poorly with the rest of the game. There are some text-placement bugs and some inconsistencies. If the devil is in the details, the author haven't succeeded hunting them all down. The game have some strategy components connected to managing a safe haven, but their impact in terms of consequenses are not very apparent.\n\nThe game have at least 10 different endings, but there is not even close to enough variety in the content based on background, stats and equipment to make me want to click through the game more times to view them.","October 27, 2015","true","39.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a well written story. I did catch a few typoes but other than that it's a pretty awesome read. It's got zombies, romancable characters, a dog, and its a pretty lengthy read. It took me about 2 days to read it but that was all most nonstop. The replay value is nice since you can try a different romance and try to get all the endings. I'd give it a 8/10.","October 27, 2015","true","17.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Again, the pictures rarely ever show.\nSo yes, if you have a problem with a ton of reading(as the trailer says, the game is about 700.000 words long) and no graphics or sound, then don't buy the game, it's not for you.\n\nReplay-ability: 100%.\nThere is a ton of different paths to take, and if you find yourself loving the game on your first take, you can replay the game many times with new content every time due to all the paths you can take.\nYes, you can choose your gender, name and sexuality. You can chose to build relationships, including becoming someones boyfriend/girlfriend.\n\nThe game does indeed have a difficulty level, if you make the wrong decisions you die and have to start from your last save point, you save quite regularly so it's not a problem, but don't except the game to as easy as it is in the first chapter, when you progress you're going to find yourself die quite a lot.\n\nHere is a thing that I picked up on, no matter what gender you chose to be, when you are refered to as he/she, you will always be refered to as he, even if you're a female, so that's a bug that needs to be fixed, if a player that is really living into the story, it can throw them off.\n\nThe one thing that really annoyed me is all the filler text.\nThere is to much text that is pointless and unnecessary added just to make the game longer, and that is very bad.\n\nThat concludes my review of the game, I suck at reviews.\n\n7/10.","October 27, 2015","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Zombie: Exodus has none of  these features and instead features a very linear story. I feel quite bait and switched given the implication in Safe Haven of skills and resource managment. The game itself is short and has some choices you can make, however they hardly alter the story and towards the end all choices kill you unless it is the option the devs want you to take. A more involved plot with more variety in gameplay, non-linear storytelling and more pictures would really bump this type of game up. I am giving this a thumbs up however really my review is "meh", for which there is no option.","November 9, 2015","true","8.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Zombie Exodus is kind of like that.\n\nPROS\nThe story is descriptive and immersive if you take the time to sit down and let it, if not a little rushed feeling and lacking pacing\n\n\nMultitude of choices that you can make\n\n\nOccasionally you get an illustration - most of which are creepy and well-drawn and add to the environment of the story\n\n\nYou can find items that can help or in some cases allow to completely bypass some situations making going out of your way to explore valuable. Just make sure you don't run into any Zombies, or worse...\n\nCONS\nThe game could have set the mood better, with the plain white background and no music/sounds reading becomes kind of redundant. A 'lights off' function like a lot of ereaders have would be a welcomed improvement and you can also just turn on your own stuff\n\nMusic Recommendations\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BeicGsv0JY\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6OtF7daIPM\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNA-TD3F6uQ\n\n\n\nBooks? On steam!?!?! But seriously, unless you’re a reader and/or interested in Zombies enough to want to read through a 750,000-word novel this probably isn't going to be a game for you.\n\n\nZombie Exodus could do heavily with a narrator. Maybe in a future update.\n\nEnding Notes\nIf you're into reading and choice games, pick this one up.\n\nIf you're not, skip over this game.\n\n","October 24, 2015","true","2.1"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","5","13","0","4"

Also, the close quarters combat is almost impossible, since even if it is one-on-one, there are parts the the zombie will overcame your powers, embrancing you while eating your flesh. And i've tried multiple times at the same part, with a combat knife, with a chivalry sword, even an spiked bat. It could be good, but it isn't.

The fact that it's 6 bucks on sale is already insulting enough for a non-game, the creator didn't even bother to put any kind of images or graphics in it to make it worth while, it's all put on a white background the whole time with the same font.

Heck, even a hentai game made by russians  are better than this thing, and they are free.\n\nThis is the state of gaming we have here today, it's either overblown PR-campaign rehash from a big-name company or another over-priced text adventure or rogue-like "game" from indie developer.

There were many decisions to make that really kept you feeling like every choice makes a difference. It was much more satisfying than the writer's other game, A Wise Use of Time, and the ending/epilogue tied everything up quite well.","December 26, 2015","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The price of this game is fairly justified.","November 29, 2015","true","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Zombie Exodus is a very well written choose-your-own-adventure story that grips you and keeps you within minutes of starting. All of the events are well described, the characters are unique and have their own stories.\n\nEverything is so well described, it paints such a vivid picture in your mind of what's going on and what you're seeing. The story is so good and the events are so memorable, that even many months later I can still remember the events that occured and the choices I made from start to finish.\n\nI would absolutely recommend this game.","April 29","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I spent all of these hours going through the story. One day, when I'm bored again, I'll replay this game and see what else I can do. If you love reading and have a good imagination, get this novel.","April 18","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
