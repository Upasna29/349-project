These guys get it and I truly believe I will buy from them again if I keep seeing games like this. The graphics were gorgeous, animations were smooth. Dying in game felt like a terrible tragedy and finishing a level truly felt satisfying.\n\nI made a video review of my first impressions:\nhttps://youtu.be/Jn-dZ-uoObs\n","April 9, 2015","true","0.1"," 23 of 33 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","23","33","3","0"

There are better cheap twin stick shooters out there, even lots of free web games that provide much more of a challenge.","April 12, 2015","false","0.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","1"

It was worth the $2 i payed for it. The game takes the style of an old arcade space shooter. The game gives you 3 lives, power ups, and an objective to complete each wave. The game also keeps track of your high score, which is cool i guess. So i would recommend getting this game if you enjoy the old arcade space shooters.","April 10, 2015","true","1.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Every enemy is predictable or on a preditermined path. Wave games are meant to implement reflexes and the players ability to process multiple scenarios while continously thining the arena and observing a potential path. This game just forces you into corners, runs you into monotonous cycles, and did a fine job of not even living up to it's name. Good thing it was only $2 on sale. It isn't even worth that, to be honest.","April 13, 2015","false","0.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Sure it's a bit simplistic, but there's nothing wrong with a game where you can just sit down and shoot everything that looks at you funny. 99 Waves to Die does that very well. The arena is a bit too small for the number of enemies that appear, but that's a minor complaint.

This can have a snowball effect in that against the advanced enemies it is harder to survive with weakened weapons. A number of times I was able to claw my way back but past level 50 it can have a 'doomed spiral' effect.\n\nI recommend this game for someone wanting a casual shoot-em-up to pass the time as there is no story mode, etc.\n\nFour things I would like to see added; a pause button, a save/load feature, steam achievements, friend leaderboard.","January 4","true","0.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's fun, and while it starts easy enough to warm you up (or to be OK to pick up for a young kid who's early to games) it gets more and more swarmy with each wave. I like that it's challenging enough for me to enjoy but that little family members who can't do major games can play something out of this too.\n\nNote that I had the benefit of playing it with a gamepad where I used both sticks - I haven't looked at what the mouse/keyboard controls are, but with a two-sticks gamepad you move with the left stick and fire with the right stick. Like if you push the right stick to the left you're firing to the left, even if you're moving up and down. For those who haven't played two-sticks shooters, be aware that if you're moving down to get away from an enemy (for example) you'll want to adjust the direction you're pressing on your right stick as you go since the enemy is not on your left now but above you. (I realize this is a given to anyone who has played this kind of game before, but this is for those who haven't.)\n\nI like this game. For the price, it's great. It also reminds me of when in the 90s you could find fun little gems in PC game software that weren't overly-done-up but that you kept going back to when you were at that certain aunt's house looking for something to do.","April 11, 2015","true","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

At later waves circle around the level. Repeat 99 times. At wave ~70 the difficulty ramps up, but at that point I was so tired I didn't even care any more.\n\nBiggest challenge is to keep yourself interested enough to avoid the occasional stray bullet or enemy spawning on top of you.","July 7, 2015","false","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay was ok; had decent changes that forces new strategies, but the end goal is to just camp a corner. The system is harsh and doesn't allow a chance after a lost life, often giving you two seconds of invulnerability before you get rammed by the swarms of ships. I also can't find the bomb button. Not entirely bad, but definitely not a recommended bullet hell game","May 13, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
