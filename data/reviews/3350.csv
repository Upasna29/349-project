Each Bejeweled is practically the same and delivers the same amount of fun in each. The goal of the game is to switch around a certain amount of jewels to put together a series of 3 or more in a line to make that line or set disappear. The graphics are perfect for the game. The sounds in the game can feel repetitive at times. The overall gameplay of the game is awesome and really burns some time for when you have time to spare. There are endless stages it feels like. Each level of the bejeweled series has its own tricks and treats for you to enjoy. I highly recommend playing these and getting any of these great Bejeweled games when you have a chance. I love playing them and these are highly recommended for anyone working in the office or at home. I love this series and i know you will too!!","February 24, 2015","true","6.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","0"

That being said, Bejeweled 2 Deluxe is FAR superior to this older version (Bejeweled 2 Deluxe has more gameplay modes, better graphics, etc.).  Not that there is anything wrong with this version, but since the newer versions are so much better you'd basically be wasting your money buying this one.  I guess if you wanted it for nostalgic reasons or you REALLY dig 800x600 resolution you could buy this...otherwise, stick to the newer versions of Bejeweled.  This one is simply obsolete.  Still, it's a great game for its time.","December 1, 2013","true","0.8"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","13","21","0","0"

Partnered with simple yet pleasant sound effects and music, this game is easy on all of the senses, and satisfying for those who don't seek an much more than that. Both the Normal and TimeTrial modes have their advantages, and add just enough to this game for it to feel complete. Seeing sister games like StarJeweled (In StarCraft II) is a wonderful experience as well!\nIf you are looking for challenge, this is not the game for you, but if you want something to keep you busy for a while and to help sharpen your eyes, you might have just found the right game.\n","September 26, 2014","true","3.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

From the smooth action of the pieces to the chunky sound effects when you make connections, this is a game it's easy to spend hours on. Or, just ten minutes when you want something to play. Not every game has to be a 60-hour epic. Whilst a lot of casual games are trite and only out to rob you via microtransactions, Bejeweled keeps it simple.\n\nThere have been many sequels, variants and additions to the series and in fact you don't seem to be able to buy the original direct from PopCap any more. I don't know why; the first is just fine as it is. Why try and improve upon it? It's like trying to improve upon Tetris. Sure, some are enjoyable and you can heap on the fancy graphics and gameplay twists, but it's the core idea which makes it work, not the frills.\n\nI just wish it had a Linux port, that's all...","November 16, 2014","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's pretty easy to see why, right? It's GOOD at what it does. Unfortunately, it hasn't really held up to the test of time and competition. Want engaging gameplay? Try Puzzle Quest. Want addictive, fast gameplay? Try Candy Crush Saga. Want your friends to look at you a little funny when you boot up a game at 3am? Try HuniePop. Hell, if you want Bejeweled, snag Bejeweled 3. Just pass this up if it's not on sale.\n\nKari's pro tip: Try setting up the largest combo you can. It isn't really necessary, but it gives a bit of a challenge to work towards in what is otherwise only a basic match-3 system.","November 30, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
