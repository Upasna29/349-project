"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/7670/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Bioshock was a genre shifting masterpiece upon release.\n\nLooking back, there are some cracks in its foundation that stand out a bit more obviously today after so many reiterations and refinements have been made to first person shooters on the whole, but that the experience is still such a rich, deep, and enthralling one is a testament to how incredible it originally was.\n\nBioshock is first and foremost the story of Rapture, an underwater utopia plunged into chaos by its own design of rejecting traditional ideology. It was a city created to be a safe haven for the most ambitious and intelligent people of the world to tap into their full potential; to experiment and create, free from the burden of morals and law found in the world above. Along with this came the discovery of a gene altering drug known as Adam, which when injected alters the hosts genetic code and bestows superhuman powers to them, from shooting fire from your fingertips to telekinesis and mind control. In a city removed from natural order restrained only by owns own ingenuity, the thirst for power eventually led to the city's demise.\n\nEntering this decrepit city as a castaway from a crashed airplane is among the most impressive and memorable opening sequences to any video game I've ever played. It's a perfectly executed series of events, informing you both of what the city once was and the nightmarish hell it became in a matter of moments, before leading you into an astonishingly well crafted world that devours you whole in its overpowering atmosphere. Everywhere you look there are callbacks, visual cues and audio diaries that retell what life was like in Rapture, and how it got to be the way it is. The sense of place and level of detail carved into the environment informing you not only what Rapture was, but what it represented, is an astounding achievement in world design and environmental narratives. There's never a room that feels out of place, or an oddly written character; it all fits together in this twisted world of objectivism steeped in the writings of Ayn Rand, so successfully realized it's almost frighteningly easy to see how a city like Rapture could potentially come about.\n\nMuch of this is presented non-verbally, with art deco banners and store fronts, dated vending machines, and various subtle hints at Rapture's history peppering the environment and bringing it to life. The disturbing sounds and dialogues of the splicers inhabiting the city add a level of characterization to enemies that turns them into more than soulless targets, providing a glimpse into their backstories and bizarre relationships, and at times making me hesitant to actually kill them (at least until they tried to).\n\nThe world design is so strong in fact that it largely overshadows the core narrative of your character, one which stays in the background until roughly 2/3 of the way through, and then ends in a rather disappointingly cliched manner. It's not to say it's bad, as when the plot finally comes to the forefront it does it in a way that's startling and unforgettable, but it seems almost secondary in many ways to the numerous auxiliary stories you hear as you make your way through rapture. It's there to keep the experience on a straight path, but it's not what drives it.\n\nWith how much depth and originality was given to creating this remarkable world, it's a remarkable feat that just as much work has been put into Bioshock's combat mechanics. Utilizing plasmids, the same substances that turned the citizens of Rapture insane, adds a host of combat options to the standard gunplay, often working in tandem with each other to open the game up for dozens of different tactics that makes combat almost like a puzzle as you mix and match the tools at your disposal to find the most potent combinations (one of my favorites was the "one-two punch" of electrocuting a splicer, the enemies of the game, and then delivering a hefty hit with the wrench). Being able to carry an entire arsenal with you further broadens your capabilities, allowing you an immense amount of freedom in how you approach encounters and with it coming a welcome amount of variety.\n\nThe inventiveness and distinction of each enemy you face layers on yet another element to combat encounters, from the different ways splicers react to you and each other (from running straight forward, arms flailing, to climbing the walls and dropping down from above), to the intense encounters with Big Daddies: huge enemies outfitted with an enormously powerful drill and far more speed an maneuverability than there colossal diving suit bodies would have you believe. These fights are brutal and require you to more carefully time your attack and fine tune your strategy, often using the environment and traps you set to your advantage as a head on approach is almost certainly suicidal.\n\nThe few areas that Bioshock trips up on are largely the result of the existence of its more mechanically sophisticated sequel, which streamlined the tedious hacking minigame and added dual wielding to make combat faster and more fluid.. They aren't huge issues in the overall picture, but it does make returning to the original harder than I'd imagined and would likely seem a bit clumsy to those who played the other two games first (which I would certainly advise against).\n\nDespite all the years since its release, very few games have managed to match the scope and creativity of Bioshock's world and mechanics (even its own two sequels). It's an astounding achievement in every area of its design, and the sort of game that would be fair to consider something of a requirement to play. It's among the most amazing games I've ever played, as well as one of my personal favorites that I see myself continuing to return to as without fail I fall back in love with it again.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","October 14, 2014","true","11.5"," 340 of 355 people (96%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","96","340","355","8","19"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/7670/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The long awaited Bioshock has the distinct honor of being the first non-sports title to usher in the long awaited holiday gaming rush. As the spiritual successor to the System Shock series, Bioshock is a highly anticipated title because of its blend of incredible visuals and innovative First Person Shooting. Our tickets to Rapture have finally arrived, and everyone is obviously wondering if Bioshock can live up to its own hype. The answer is a resounding yes, as Bioshock is a genre-bending adventure-roleplaying-FPS hybrid that completely absorbs the player and doesn't let go until the thrilling end.\n\nBioshock takes place in the underwater city of Rapture, built by the homicidal genius Andrew Ryan. Ryan conceived Rapture as a place for geniuses and the mentally elite to be able to separate themselves for society and flourish without the constrictions placed on them by morality and government. However, something goes deathly wrong in Rapture, leaving most of the inhabitants dead or raving, murderous lunatics. The game begins with the protagonist as the lone survivor of a plane crash in the ocean, with Rapture being your only hope of refuge. You quickly get caught up in unraveling the mystery of Rapture as you fight for survival, getting caught up in the different objectives of other "sane" inhabitants that usually need favors before they'll aid you to escape to safety.\n\nThe blessing and curse of Rapture is the rampant use of Adam, a material that allows individuals to alter their own genetic code and give themselves superhuman abilities. Adam is a hot commodity in Rapture even long after most of its inhabitants are dead. Odd ghoulish girls called Little Sisters harvest Adam from dead bodies while armored monster known as Big Daddies protect the girls from harm. This relationship between Adam, the Little Sisters and the Big Daddies is at the core of Bioshock. Your character needs Adam to evolve and to remain capable of surviving the various foes that Rapture throws at you. However, the choice at the center of the gameplay revolves around the sacrifice of the Little Sisters. Will you kill the changed little girls to get maximum Adam, or will you attempt to save them and risk not having enough power to stay alive?\n\nThe first and most noticeable thing about Bioshock are the visuals. Bioshock simply looks gorgeous. The underwater effects are among the best ever in a game, which is wonderful since there is a lot of water in the game considering that it takes place at the bottom of the ocean. The character models all animate incredibly as well, and even the protagonist has lifelike movements, flexing his on-screen hands occasionally in a convincing manner for the idle animations. The varied locales all look great as well, ensuring that the game experience is as immersive as possible. Rapture actually feels like the dilapidated city it is supposed to be. You'll encounter scattered bodies, some hung, some killed by gunfire, some killed by traps. There's always a sense that something has happened here, that the stage isn't a simple backdrop for you to explore.\n\nThe next most noticeable thing is the high level of audio quality in the game. The sound effects are all spot on, from the bang of the shotgun to the whisper of the Little Sister to their protectors. The assorted splicers all chatter when they believe themselves to be alone, espousing nonsensical or deranged statements that reinforce their insanity. Also commendable are the voice actors in the various audio diaries scattered around Rapture.\n\nThis brings us to perhaps the best quality in Bioshock... the story. Bioshock masterfully weaves an intricate tale by allowing you, the player, to piece together the story of Rapture and its mysterious fall. The various audio diaries, though not essential, help to evince the large picture for the player in between radio transmissions for various characters that guide you to the finale.\n\nThough classified as a First Person Shooter, Bioshock shares elements with a role-playing game or an adventure title. The various plasmid induced abilities as well as the different Adam-costing upgrades to your character give you a constant feeling of growth.There are also assorted "minigames", such as the ability to hack different machines via a pipeline game, or the ability to take photos of your enemies to give your character combat bonuses against them. There are also slots for combat, physical ability, and engineering where you can equip gene tonics, which enhance your abilities with traits such as a faster melee attack or the ability to turn invisible when idle. You can also upgrade your weaponry and invent items at designated stations. This variety serves to keep the gameplay fresh, as your character is always encountering a new ability, a new weapon, or better traits.","May 11, 2014","true","129.6"," 265 of 288 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","265","288","0","8"

A wonder.\n\nFor me, it has a much more value than Bioshock 2 or Infinite, because it was before, and it said it all, loud and clear.\n\nI don't believe you've not heard a thing about Bioshock, it would be a total bewilderment!\nYet I must state there, that Bioshock was like a grasp of fresh air for a submariner, when it hit the shelves in the 2007.\n\nIn the thick of of bleak and obtuse FPS games, flooded all stocks and minds, Bioshock felt like a blessing from above. Ken Levine made his brightest shot into the eternity. Bioshock is a Magnum Opus. A real deal stuff. A resurrection of System Shock principles with the isogenic battle system (mixture of guns, guts, wits and magic), with modern, looking-better-than-Half-Life-2-graphics, and deep, dark, sound and comprehensive story. Again mankind was looking for salvation, but drowned itself by ever-growing sins like greed, powerlust, and false infallibility.\n\nA miraculous experience of witnessing the end of time and humanity. A travel to mad scientist inner space. A nice reason to forget about sleep, in my book.\n\nMark is 8.5/10: the narrative falls down a little in the very end, and there are some other distracting little things on the way through Rapture, that keeps me from praising Bioshock as "the-best-my-eyes-ever-seen!" title. But it is still a brilliant of game design, totally worth of your time.","October 14, 2015","true","38.1"," 254 of 277 people (92%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","92","254","277","19","8"

You are able to make your way to an island where a submarine is waiting to take you to into the great depths below where the mysterious underwater city of Rapture awaits. The city is trashed and genetic freaks called splicers roam around, attacking anything that gets in front of them. In order to survive you will have fight through these Splicers and other oddities keeping your eyes and ears open for clues into what has gone wrong, how you may be able to help or how you can escape.\nOne aspect that makes the storyline work so well is the way it is told. BioShock uses a real time method of telling the story through random radio reports, overheard conversations and audio recordings.\nYou can choose from a variety of different weapons, anywhere from pistols and shotguns to chemical throwers and grenade launchers. Each gun has different ammo that you can use. There are also many plasmids that you can use. You can electrify the water to kill everyone in it, set people on fire, freeze them and then smash them with a wrench, among other things.\nThe graphics in this game are good, out of date, but still good.\nThe sound of BioShock really puts you into the game. From the creepy things the splicers say to the background music, everything fits perfect.\nBioShock builds a great atmosphere by using terrific graphics and sound to set a creepy mood.

Has its lows like most though but I have to say it impressed me how the story develops and gives you much more than what you could get by just running through shooting things (like you do in some shooters).\n\nIt's a different shooter in most ways, let's say shooting weapons is not what you'll be doing the most in the entire game, you'll have these kind of superpower things named plasmids which are the aquired and upgraded as you advance and consume a meter bar named eve each time you use them. Also hacking stuff (security cameras, turrets) is a good part of it if you decide to, which is somesort of minigame but very helpful IMO.\n\nIt's kind of easy if you ask me. I spent the entire game trying to save on everything, I mean, always have the maximum medipacks, the maximum ammo for every gun, etc. Every single bullet was important. I regret that choice as I ended up with most of my arsenal and currency unused. Yes you can run half of the game thru just using very little ammo/eve and just melee attacking your enemies with a wrench (default attack). Of course you'll have a lot more fun if you use guns/plasmids which I recommend you to. There are some unbalanced plasmids however, but try all of them so you can see for yourself which ones you like the most.\n\nAlso, if you want to get the most of the story you should try to listen as many records as you can, helps you understand the whole thing (you'll find them randomly across the entire game).\n\nYou'll definitely have a good time playing this. Worth $20? Definitely, but you can find it for $5 on most sales.","November 26, 2013","true","26.8"," 165 of 172 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","165","172","0","0"

It is the story of a man who wakes up in the ocean and stumbles into an underwater city full of grumpy people.  In this city it is not only common, but encouraged, to buy chemical supplements and inject them willy nilly into your body.  This seems to have had a negative effect on the general population, but it doesn't stop you from doing it.  Bioshock features monsters and madness, suspense and surprises, twists and turtles, parents and powerups.\n\nPros:\nAtmosphere.  Bioshock's environment is completely unique.  It's a city with a real story to it, and you learn about it from the plot and the environment itself.  It's beautiful and creepy and immersive.  The music is awesome, the art is awesome, the NPC dialogue is awesome.  Bioshock's atmosphere is awesome.\nPlot.  Bioshock's story is complex, deep, and of course interesting.  It's constantly engaging, you always want to keep going to find out what the hell is going on, and of course what the hell happened.  It poses questions about individuality, capitalism, government, morality, selfishness... maaaaaan, it's great.\nNifty combat.  You get to use superpowers, but you are never overpowered.  Combat is always challenging.  Enemies are varied and interesting.  Big daddies are so fresh.  They are terrifying.\nLength.  Bioshock is actually a long game (31 hours for me), but it doesn't overstay its welcome.  It's most definitely not padded, it's always moving forward.  You get your money's worth.\nCons:\nYou collect way more money and goods than you can ever use.   You just fill up on everything and have nothing interesting to buy.\nHonestly, the guns feel a little... man, I don't even know how to describe it.  Floaty?  Disconnected?  Not smooth?\nConclusion:\nBioshock is fantastic and you will be thinking about it long after you've completed it.

I like to call it CRYTEK's "Crysis" of its time.\nI do not particularly care for FPS (usually play only the good AAA FPS titles), yet this game managed to give me such a good ever-lasting impression.\n\nSTORY:\nWelcome to the Underwater World of Rapture!\nYour commercial Jetliner crashes in the Ocean. You are the only survivor and manage to swim to a little piece of land. On this piece of land is a little submarine type vessel - you climb into it & pull a lever it causes the vessel to take you underwater. As you are submerging you see a whole city built underwater. This is Rapture. A place built for people who sought freedom from persecution, religion, politics & the morals/ethics of the world. You find out that they began to play around with Biological/Genetic enhancements and that somehow things went wrong.\n\nThe Setting is very interesting and beautiful but very disturbing as you will soon find out.\nThe Story can get a little confusing at times, but as I mentioned, there is a really awesome WTF Moment or Plot Twist. This happens about half way through the game and after that things should start making a little sense.\nTo enjoy the story to its fullest be sure to collect and listen to all audio logs. They contain vital story points, in depth information about the characters of Rapture and how it all fell apart.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nVery Unique FPS: Your using of Weapons, Different Types of Ammunition, Plasmids and the Environment all in combination (e.g. Shock Plasmid + Water Combo) to defeat your foes was something new at the time. It had never been done before and it works really great. Never did the combat feel dull or repetitive to me.\nThere are also light puzzles/riddles to solve and hidden areas to find that are loaded with loot & other goodies.\n\n\nWARNINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n1) Play on the hardest difficulty so that you are forced to use use combos and converve ammuniton to survive.\n\n2) Do not  kill Cohen after helping him with his "masterpiece".

A FPS at its core, and the spiritual successor of the System Shock series, Bioshock is rooted in a strong and established foundation. But it isn’t just any other FPS game that will be mildly fun and then quickly forgotten. It is so much more than that. The fantastic gameworld design, the gripping atmosphere, the mysterious narrative, the idiosyncratic characters, and the uniquely identifying combat system all contribute to propelling this game into the elite caste. It is a legendary masterwork of gaming culture, and I posit: anyone who has yet to experience it would be wise to change that.\n\nWith the high quality of all of the aspects of the game, it is difficult to name one as the “best.” But I would have to argue the most defining and inspired aspect is the wondrous and mystical gameworld atmosphere. The captivating atmosphere will grab hold of you from the opening scene and not let go until the ending credits. The world of Rapture is an absolute pleasure to explore and the ominous, dystopian ambiance is splendidly engaging. And it isn’t just the obvious things, but also the little subtleties and minute details that really elevate the gameworld atmosphere to elite status. The attention to detail is outstanding. Bioshock has an undeniably “A+” presentation.\n\nThe narrative elements of the game are also exquisite. There is a main storyline that unfolds as you play and there is also a clouded history of lore that slowly becomes clear as you progress the game and discover the collectibles (which provide backstory). This multidirectional storytelling will keep you curious to learn more at all times, adroitly holding your interest as you make your way through the campaign. Moreover, the well-designed character development leads to interesting and idiosyncratic NPCs that are infinitely more intriguing than the usual forgettable clichés. It all amounts to an overall experience that will keep you engaged and entertained.\n\nAs for the actual gameplay and combat, it is quite unique and variable. Nevertheless, I will admit that it isn’t necessarily the most riveting combat system around. But, as you are part gunslinger and part spellcaster, you can wreak havoc on your foes in a wide variety of ways. That, and the ability to purchase upgrades for your gear and abilities will keep the combat fresh and interesting throughout a playthrough.  Aside from that, there are also many collectibles to search for, there is loot hidden all over, and there are hundreds of interesting little things to look at. There is a lot going on.\n\nThe last thing I’ll specifically mention regarding Bioshock is that I believe a large reason as to why it is so well received in the gaming community is because of all of the little things that were done right in allowing the player to decide how he/she wants to play the game. For instance, there is a great autosave/checkpoint system that won’t screw you over if you mess up and there is also an option for unlimited respawns (if you choose to use it). On top of that, you are free to manually save whenever you want. Or you can turn off respawns and never manually save if that’s your preference. Also, there is a large amount of lore, backstory, and narrative elements, but there isn’t hours of forced dialogue or unskippable cutscenes. You are mostly free to choose how much you want to learn or how much you want to plow through the game. This fundamentally open design allows for a wide audience to easily enjoy the game.\n\nBioshock is a great game. If you haven’t checked it out yet, you would be wise to make time. It will definitely appeal to most gamers, especially fans of FPS games, RPGs, and strong narrative elements.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","March 9","true","11.7"," 99 of 100 people (99%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","99","99","100","3","11"

It exceeds in almost all areas, but no gem is without its flaws. Unfortunately for BioShock, these flaws can be quite noticeable when you come across to them. DO NOT let that discourage you from playing this game though; it's an experience you don't want to miss.\n\nIn terms of presentation, BioShock fails to unimpress. The view of the underwater city of Rapture will amaze you when it emerges on your screen, http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=260940875\nand the steampunk art style is very unique, while being consistent throughout the game. Voice acting is perfect without a doubt, and characters such as Ryan Andrew and Sander Cohen will leave a lasting impression long after you finish the game. Sound design is extremly well-done as well: the whale-like moans from the hulking Big Daddies are very creepy, and the game only uses music for atmospheric reasons, http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=260940890\nadding an extra layer of immersion that makes the game quite creepy, but never outright scary (which is not what the game is trying to do).\n\nThe story is the main highlight of BioShock, and presents themes and ideologies that are very applicable to reality, mainly the view of objectivism. Plot twists and unforgetable characters will make the experience a memorable ones, and each audio-diary will flesh out the world of Rapture, especially in events following up to the game. As for the main protagonist Jack, he's the typical silent playable character that every shooter seems to have, but his background information makes him quite interesting. Despite this, the story is damned near perfect, even if it feels ever-so rushed after the games huge revelation and twist.\n\nBioShock is a prime example of how video games are art, and is one you should not overlook. Even where it missteps in gameplay, it's story and presentation are grand throughout, and provide a unique experience you will not forget and will come back to again and again. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=261227078\nThere is no denying that BioShock is a game that will stand the test of time.","March 26, 2015","true","10.2"," 123 of 137 people (90%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","90","123","137","24","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/7670/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nBioShock is a FPS that was released in 2007, the story is very interesting, the game play is quite enjoyable, as you progress through the game you get different abilities, power ups, and new weapons that can also be powered up. All in all, this is a classic FPS to many gamers out there.\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  Welcome to Rapture, a city devoid of morals and government. A city where the inventor can invent, where a scientist can do science without the government questioning ethics. Oh and one more thing about Rapture... It's at the bottom of the Sea.\nAs far as the story goes, you've just stumbled across rapture and now you need to try to get out of here alive, one problem Ryan {the founder of Rapture} is out to kill you. You will be helped along by a man named "Atlas" to navigate the various things you need to do to survive in Rapture.\nAs you progress you will meet several people who will either try to help you along your way, or kill you, or both. The game is very streamlined, as long as you check the map it is quite difficult to get lost in this game.\n\nGame Play: The first FPS "Story" game that I played was Half Life 2, so when you start out a game with nothing but a Melee weapon, and then eventually pick up more weapons as the game progresses, I can't help but have flash backs to the good days of Half Life 2. I'm sure there's a name for that type of game mechanic development, but I will simply call it "the half life progression".\nYou start out with a pipe wrench, which I proceeded to hit everything with... Dead bodies, light switches, little sisters, pretty much anyone who wasn't a "big daddy" (Because big daddy's would knock me into tomorrow if I wasn't fighting my hardest). Sorry, I digress; I love that wrench. The first few weapons you get are: Wrench, Pistol, Shotgun. You get about 8 different weapons but I won't spoil the rest for you, they're fun, trust me.\nYou also get special abilities that require "the blue stuff" as I've so quaintly called it. What I want to call "Mana", "Force skills", and more names of blue energy meters is actually known as "Plasmid", which can only be restored by stabbing yourself in the arm with EVE syringes. You collect several abilities that use this energy source, the basic ones being: Shock, Fire, Telekinesis (Force pull *cough* ).\nThere is one more thing to note about game play: Hacking. To hack you play a simple mini game that you need to complete circuits on. Before you try to hack you're warned how difficulty the hack will be and then you need to navigate a slow moving flow through a maze to complete a circuit, I found most of these to be very easy. Which made this part of the game slightly forgettable, but it does give you a break from the hoards of splicers trying to slice off your face.\n\nAchievements: At the time that I'm writing this, there are no achievements for this game, but sometime I would expect there to be a release updating and providing the Xbox achievements to steam users. (Date written: 10/23/14)\n\nPrice: BioShock's standard price is $19.99. As I always say, I recommend buying the game on a sale, or from a humble bundle. So far I've played roughly 15 hours of the game, on normal difficulty. So this isn't one of those games where you're going to spend a large amount of time playing it. And since there aren't achievements I won't be pumping in extra time.\n\nConclusion: Story: memorable. Game play: Logical. Achievements: Nonexistent. Price: Affordable. For everything else there's MasterCard.\n\n...I wanted to end it that way, but I'll elaborate a tiny bit more as to what kind of person would enjoy Bioshock; most FPS players would enjoy this game, and probably find it quite easy to play. This game has high intensity, it's nowhere near "horror" quality, but the game keeps you tense for what's about to happen to you next.\nI recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a bit of a different chance of pace for their typical First Person Shooter games, BioShock definitely sets itself apart from the rest; which is probably why it's such a favorite to many.\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update April 10, 2015:\nHere's the URL to see my review for Bioshock 2\nHere's the URL to see my review for Bioshock Infinite","October 23, 2014","true","13.4"," 76 of 83 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","76","83","5","3"

The game takes place in a ciy called Rapture, a city under the sea created by Andre Ryan to be a utopia, where people's dreams would not be limited by things such as government or morality. You play as Jack, a man in a plane crash that landed in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, who finds a Lighthouse that leads to Rapture, now ruined and destroyed due to a war created by Atlas, a man who leads a rebellion group against Andrew Ryan, and wants to help you survive as you fight Splicers (genetic mutants created by splicing up on something called ADAM; a substance found at the bottom of the ocean that can be used for a variety of purpose. Medical, entertainment, or even getting powers called Plasmids) and Big Daddies, protecters of the Little Sisters, who hold sea slugs in their stomachs that produce loads of ADAM.\n\nThe gameplay is fantastic. Bioshock is a FPS with RPG and Survival Horror elements. You can geta total of 6 different guns throughout the game, each of which are good for certain situations. You can also upgrade these guns to make them stronger and better over the course of the game. You can also collect different types of ammo for each gun, usually there's a normal type, a type good for armored foes, and a type good for fleshy foes. Then of course, there's ADAM. ADAM is obtained after killing a Big Daddy, then by making a decision on whether or not to let their Little Sister to live. If they live, you get some ADAM, but for every 3 you rescue, you get rewards. Or, you can harvest them and get a huge amount of ADAM, but no rewards. ADAM can be spent on Plasmids and Tonics. Plasmids are you're alternative to guns, basically giving you special powers over the course of the game. Tonics give you're character direct upgrades, of which have varying degrees of usefulness. The gameplay has so many layaers of depth and strategy, and is still realy good in high-strung intense action moments. And it's just plain fun to shoot bees at a splicer, then set them on fire, and when they jump into water to get rid of the fire, you can eletrocute them and finish them off.\n\nEven if the gameplay wasn't good, the story alone is worth the buy. I won't spoil it, nor will I reiterate what I already wrote, but know that the story of Bioshock is not only one of the best, most though-provoking stories there is, but the best part about it is that it could only work as a video game, nothing else, as the story brings up the idea of whether or not the player's choices have an impact, and whether or not the player actually had a choice throughout the whole game. It helps that all the characters in the game are very complex and believable. I could write an entire essay about how amazing the story is, but I won't because I don't feel like wasting you're time. Now, would you kindly buy this freaking game already?","November 9, 2014","true","62.3"," 55 of 57 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","55","57","2","0"

This game has to be one of the best story’s I have ever played.  I went in not liking the game not wanting to play the game.  And even though it did take me about a month or two of casual gaming to achieve the ending because I did not want to play it.  The game play and story won me over.  This has to be one of the scariest, 80's hack and slash style movie, rolled into a first person shooter.  Now if you have read my other reviews you know I'm not a huge fan FPS's (first person shooters).  I do like to play video games so I play them and above all else I love video games with a fantastic story and this has one.  Bioshock is like the Twilight Zone meets Alfred Hitchcock and they had a baby.  Now I think it took me so long to get into the game because it starts off slow and you are leveling your character getting new ability’s, weapons, and getting the crap scared out of you by the slicers and the enviroment.  It takes you awhile to start to understand this game its set in the 1950's in an underwater city called Rapture.  If you are going to play it the biggest element to the game are the audio diaries.  They give you an inside look into the minds of the citizens of Rapture and explain how the city has evolved into its current state of commotion.  There are some essential lines in the game and one of the best is at the very begin as you ascend to the majestic city.   “I am Andrew Ryan, and I'm here to ask you a question. Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow? 'No!' says the man in Washington, 'It belongs to the poor.' 'No!' says the man in the Vatican, 'It belongs to God.' 'No!' says the man in Moscow, 'It belongs to everyone.' I rejected those answers; instead, I chose something different. I chose the impossible. I chose... Rapture...”     This honestly does set the tone for the rest of game.  Now if you are going to play this game beware there are three different endings.  Make up your mind at the begin which way to go kill, save, or do both on the little sisters those three options determine your ending.  The game is 14-20 hours long depending on your play level and style.   Now I can't stress the audio diaries enough they are essential for you to get the whole story out of this phenomenal game.  Just when you think you are like this is it this is the ending nope hold on to your hat.  I think that was a decisive turning occurrence for me to start apprenticing this game and seeing why it has a 96 meta critic score.   Now the downside the game crashed on me a few different times. (Windows 7 user)  So just save often.  The story little slow at first but it picks up.  Wallet has a cap.  Hacking certain machines not set up to well I thought. Bots not the brightest.  Now the last couple I'm nitpicking because honestly this game doesn't have a lot of flaws in my opinion other then being a first person shooter :)  Get it love and play it again and again.","February 28, 2014","true","15.0"," 67 of 84 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","67","84","0","0"

It takes place in year 1960, while travelling in a plane ya had a accident which ya survived in a middle of the sea, yet with a hope ya stumbled a small building with a golden statue at the top with a weird machine inside. After turning it on ya went down to the city build under the sea called Rapture, which fell due to the one man called Andrew Ryan, the owner of this city corrupted by the power created from the strange liquid called ADAM, which was never seen in the surface. Almost all of the people were addicted to it and started killing each other. While giving up hope, one man called Atlas who is against Ryan asks for your help to stop the madness.\n\nWhen it comes to the graphics I must say it still holds up to this day and looks great, though like with Unreal Engine 3 ya might expect a quality change that always happens when ya loaded a game but then changes back to normal. Basically any PC ya own in and after 2007 will run it.\n\nNow the gameplay...The most important aspect in every game. It is amazing! While the ammo and weapons may be scarce you also have another arsenal at you disposal....PLASMIDS! At the cost of EVE you can use them to either shoot lightning which can open locked areas, create a fire to melt the blocking ice or even use the telekinesis to stop an incoming rocket flying to your face and redirect it back to the enemy! There are also other Plasmids that does not require EVE and affects your status in combat or other situations.\n\nAlmost every weapon can use other types of ammunition ranging from armor piercing to the incinerating ones and ya may find Weapon Upgrade stations which you can choose only one upgrade for each weapon so choose wisely! If you are low on something but have some money you can use shopping ventsto buy stuff but if you think you don't have enough money then you can always hack them!\n\nHacking lets you turn any turret to turn against the enemies, lower the price for shops or change the healing station to hurt anyone except you and you do that by doing a minigame which requires you to place pipes in any order to let the cyan goo reach the end without leaking it or get to the damaged ones. Be aware that the more you progress in the game it gets more harder.\n\nIf you think that you do not understand the plot in overall then you might have missed a lot of Audio Logs. From the Audio Logs you can find more about what was the life in the city and/or even dig more about the owner and his situation.\n\nIf you liked Fallout's old styled music then you can find em here as well while sharing the newer ones and pretty much fits the game so perfectly. The sounds are also great and the voice acting is quite great.\n\nOverall, if you think about getting the game then....Would you kindly buy and play it? It is worth 20 Euro for it!","November 26, 2013","true","11.9"," 91 of 123 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","91","123","0","17"

The Narrative, told though voice-logs and a 1-way radio, does a great job in maintaining a good distance for the player; A perfect balance is struck between isolation (being forced to fight off hordes of splicers alone) and companionship (hearing a friendly voice motivate you forward.)\n\nAs for the gameplay, barring a few personal gripes (there shouldn't ever be a hack that is 100% impossible, solely due to bad RNG), there are very few things to dislike.  The wide selection of plasmids and firearms allows for numerous playstyles and adds a bit of replay value.\n\nI'd personally enjoy it if you could limit your armory to just the weapons you use regularly (too many times did I over-scroll to the chemical thrower when just trying to take a simple picture), but this is in no way a deal-breaker.  Whether you heard about it back in the day and are just getting around to the classics, or recently played Bioshock Infinite and wanted to know what happened, this game is without a doubt worth a play, even if it may appear a bit visually dated.","October 17, 2015","true","15.3"," 36 of 37 people (97%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","97","36","37","7","0"

It almost felt like a survial horror. The setting story is one of the best I've ever seen in a video game, It's like a game and a movie combined but it's not too cinematic. The enemy designs are what makes this game so good. The Big Daddies are fun mini bosses to fight and also challenging on higher difficulties and the splicers are crazy as hell. The first few mins of this game creeped me out when I was younger. This is by far the most scariest Bioshock game in the series. Gotta love the bunnymasks the splicers are wearing. I would say fighting Sander Cohen was my favorite part of this game. Just killing Splicers while Waltz of the Flowers is playing just feels so... you cant get that in any other video game!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ayres662/recommended/7670/","ayres662","Bloody George","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ayres662/","350 products in account","This masterpiece is a lesson that should be taught to every game developer involved in the FPS genre. I could save a few compliments and shorten this rather passionate, but humble, homage. But no. When talking about BioShock, one should let the words flow, just like the essence of its beautiful concept flows richly and vividly through every character's line, every thematic poster hanging on a random wall, every bit of Art Deco reconstruction, and every trace of Andrew Ryan's infamous personality.\n\nWhen I first played this game, back in 2009, I couldn't believe my eyes. The compelling and psychologically deep story that I was witnessing should be in a book or something "narratively more complex". Back then, with all my ignorance and prejudice towards the potential of videogame storytelling, I hadn't realised what sin I was carrying on my mind. The way I've come to think is: BioShock should've always been what it is: a story-driven, linear first-person shooter that touches the deepest veins of your perceptions on notions of compassion, violence, regret, love, and themes such as mindless obedience, civil disorder, despotic leadership, dystopian lunacy, transhuman monstrosity, and other rather shocking motifs that this game courageously explores. Images of fear and perdition that make us cringe, but also touching scenes of sacrifice and loyalty.\n\nTroubled and oftentimes scary characters are all over the place (including the player-character). It's as though journeying deep into the sea brings a progressive loss of sanity and grasp on common sense in virtually all the individuals involved. Coming back to the surface would be their only redemption (cleansing), not only salvation (rescue).\n\nOn top of that, there is the addictive gameplay, with the clever and concise variety of weapons that respond directly to specific situations and areas, enemies and game frenzy. The plasmid feature dialogues with the game's spiritual ancestor, System Shock, as do most of the dystopian themes here represented. The enemies and their classes also adapt excellently to the progression in the game, making the contention *difficulty vis-à-vis enjoyment* close to perfection.\n\nThe emblematic setting, and a unique steampunk atmosphere in the depths of the ocean. It's an eschatological drama in videogame form. The oneiric visions of mankind crushed by its own mental abyss.","June 14, 2014","true","33.6"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","29","31","0","1"

A few years ago I restarted the game with the intent of finishing it, but managed to get about 2/3rds in before dropping out again.  I finally replayed this game in the year of our lord 2015, and for once finished it.  Let me get this out of the way up top: The game is 100% worth playing (or even replaying).\n\nGood Stuff:-The setting is super original: an underwater laissez faire utopia filled with the best and brightest, ripped apart by civil war due in part to the discovery of a gene altering substance.\n-Combat is pretty good.  Tons of guns (that you can carry all at once!) and a variety of magic powers called "Plasmids" that vary from shooting fireballs to hacking turrets.\n-Passive buffs via tonics that you purchase/find and equip allow you to personalize your playstyle somewhat.\n-Varried enemy design, with thoughts taken into enemy placement in the level itself to provide interesting fights.\n-Great level design, from the layout to the art design.  Levels are open with multiple branches off the main 'hub' of each level that are typically explored throughout the level via progression towards your goal.  Although there is some backtracking, enemies are usually placed in a way that makes fights fun and interesting.\n-Water and particle effects are still pretty good.\n-Audio design is great, from the sounds of water puddling in hallways to the ambient effects your plasmids make when you equip them.  All the work goes into create a stellar atmosphere that lets you buy into the world.\n\nBad Stuff:-The first 2/3rds of the game are a bit predictable in terms of how the game delays your progress narratively.\n-The last act of the game is a bit more linear than the first 2/3rds, and the final fight really stinks.\n-Some people think the audio journals are an overused trope, but I personally liked them for how they build the backstory.\n-Switching between your gun and plasmid is annoying at first, but you'll get used to it with practice.\n-The hacking minigame got boring for me about 1/3rd through the game, but some people might like it.\n-Most of the textures have this shiny look to them that makes them look like plastic.\n\nUgly Stuff:-Be prepaired to work a bit to get this game running smoothly. I had a ton of crashes before turning off the steam-overlay and forcing the game to run in DX9 before it ran smoothly.  There are a ton of steam guides to help you fix that stuff up though.\n-Audio can hitch and cut-out during combat when too many sounds are playing at once.  I couldn't figure out how to fix this one, but luckily no dialogue is cut out.\n-Physics calculations in the game are played at 30 fps, making them stand out a bit on modern machines.\n-Options menu is a bit dated and you'll have to do some INI editing to adjust things like FOV and proper sensitivity.\n\nVerdict:Bioshock is still worth revisiting, if just for the story and gameplay alone.  It's a decently sized game and took me around 12 hours to beat, with the only downsides being that the final act is a bit lackluster and that the game looks dated and might take some playing around to get it to run without crashing.  But you're rewarded with a good shooter with a fantastic story and world that makes you interested to find out more every step of the way.\n\nTip: You probably want to up the difficulty, the mid game and onwards is pretty trivial on medium difficulty.","August 2, 2015","true","20.8"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

Please verify mental integrity of your surgeon prior to undergoing any surgical procedure. Dr Steinman's Aesthetic Ideals bears no liability for loss of life, limb, appearance, or sanity. Proceed at your own risk.\n\n\nSome games, as with cooking, follow a recipe. The System Shock series prepared a great dish; BioShock took that formula, substituted a few ingredients, and presented a game worthy of being a System Shock successor. BioShock is not only visually appealing, is jam-packed with sweat drenched palms on the pants audio, but also with a great story that unfolds as you frantically meander throughout Rapture.\n\nBeing violently thrown into the game, you are left with no choice other than to go down the rabbit hole, to enter this submerged version of Wonderland; a place that is as dangerous as it is curious. You are informally greeted by a denizen of Rapture, although they do not appear to be a friendly Welcome Wagon. Much like SS2, you are immediately put on the offensive, and will remain that way for the rest of the game.\n\nThe inhabitants of Rapture are fighting a guerilla war. They know the terrain, have the weapons, and their leaders will stop at nothing to win. You will pick up weapons and skills along the way that will prepare you for the fight ahead. Being that Rapture is located many leagues under the sea, there will be no fresh supplies, no reinforcements, you'll be lucky to even find a way out of this madhouse. You have to learn to fight fire with fire, in some cases quite literally.\n\n\nStand by for a Public Service Announcement...\n\n"What are you doing, Billy?"\n"What does it look like Sam? I'm taking Incinerate!"\n"My mommy told me Splicing is bad for you and that only grown-ups should do it."\n"Oh you're such a square! All the cool kids are Splicing. You should try it."\n\nCut to Sam using Incinerate! Sam begins to seize and falls unconscious. A few seconds later Sam wakes up, looks wildly around, and then looks at Billy in a maniacal manner. Sam then lifts his arm, points a finger at Billy, and we see Billy burst into flames. In the foreground Billy collapses to the floor, writhing and screaming, while in the background Sam is walking away and whistling.\n\n"You're right, all the cool kids are doing it!"\n\nRemember kids, Splicing is for grown-ups only!\n\n\nAre there any allies here? Is the enemy of my enemy, my friend? Or are they my enemy? Sometimes it is hard to tell them apart. There are several enemy classes here, many of which require specialized ammo or attacks to kill. Life at the bottom of the briny sea and habitual overuse of ADAM has driven some of the more unique characters mad in a way that is both charming as it is horrifying. And some decisions in the game are of a moral nature, almost allowing you to descend into a madness of your own.\n\nThe levels make full use of limited lighting, which seems only fitting given the nature of a derelict city at the bottom of the ocean. Sometimes you cannot tell if someone is lurking in the shadows or if even the shadows are a true representation of what you think you see. The audio is phenomenal; whether it is voices echoing throughout the corridors, the overhead "Rapture Reminders" or the sound of metal on metal as an enemy approaches, dragging something behind them.\n\nOther great carryovers from SS2 include:\nThe hacking system. It's not overly complex, but given quick reflexes and a bit of luck, you can find yourself with a nice stash of ammo and money to further your cause.\nLinear & isolated environment. For the most part, you are free to revisit areas that you've been to before, but some areas remain staunchly inaccessable. Also, since you are at the bottom of the ocean there is nowhere to run to and very few places to hide.\nAudio logs. This was a time honored tradition in the System Shock series. It really gives you a sense of the impending madness and slow decay of Rapture.\nResearch. It isn't specifically carried out in the same manner, but it gives you a leg up for certain.\nUpgrades. While the nature of the upgrades is different, it still gave you some control in customizing your character.\nProtagonists & Antagonists. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.\nLimited inventory. In the case of BioShock, you can carry around Medkits, Eve hypos, ADAM, and ammo, but everything else is use it or lose it.\n\nBioShock is a fantastic game, carrying on a proud tradition. It's a SciFi, Fantasy, RPG, FPS, Survival game that fills the void that remained empty for so many years.\n\nIf you haven't bought BioShock yet, would you kindly get it already? You won't regret it.","January 23","true","24.8"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","11","11","5","0"

From it's breathtaking art deco scenery to it's disturbing, deep story, Bioshock succeeds where countless others have failed. It transcends gaming, crafting an ethereal existence on another plane. Part shooter, part horror, part social commentary, all masterpiece.\n\nGames like this come around only so many times a year, they need to be experienced by everyone, be it on the Xbox 360 or the PC. A game that is for all intents and purposes, perfect, is a remarkable achievement. Bioshock will take you on an underwater thrill ride that will leave you breathless, shaking and satisfied in a curious, perhaps even morbid way.

This is an Atlantis-like steampunk world where a disaster has happened. You go down into Rapture and have to figure things out to help the people down there, but as you play you will come to understand the character you are playing as and the world around you.At first it will comes across as 'do this', 'do that' but you will come to understand the meaning behind all of it. The story for the most part is told through voice recordings (So no 60 minute long cutscenes).You also find old voice messages left by people before they died, that tell you more about the backstory of the world. The further I got into the game, the more interesting it became to me and after I had completed the game I was searching the internet to find out more about Rapture.\n\nThe gameplay is fun, the weapons feel nice to use, but occasionally I felt that my character moved too slowly. I played the game on medium difficulty and still found the combat challenging enough. I would recommend that if you play on this difficulty to spam E on every searchable container to get ammo, health, cash etc.This is because medium can become boring as you often don't have enough ammo and keep having to respawn at Vita Chambers.Due to these Vita Chambers, I sometimes got the feeling I was playing a multiplayer game. Because when I died I would just respawn and have to run back to where the enemies were. So death feels like it has little consequence.Many people complain about the amount of hacking you have to do if you don't want to be shredded instantly by the turrets.At first I didn't really have any problems with it and hacked every object that could be hacked, but as I progressed through the game I got really tired of it.As well as guns the game also has Plasmids, which are special powers that you can perform with your characters left hand.These Plasmids, like your guns, can be upgraded.The RPG elements in this game really makes you consider which items should be taken with you and which should be left behind.\n\nThe world has this great Atlantis vibe. Everything in the world of Rapture is enclosed, which helps the game to achieve no pop-in and have great looking environments. These still look great after all this time because of the attention to detail, time and effort put in to them. You only see some problems when you get too close to certain textures. Because of the narrowness of the environments and the use of audio, you get this creepy haunted house feeling.A feeling that around every corner something strange could happen.I only wish that the game had given us more open environments and that the watery world outside of Rapture was more interesting to look at.The A.I. makes good use of its environment. For example, when they are low on health they will run to a nearby healing machine, or if they are on fire they will jump into water to extinguish themselves.The enemies are well realised with great acrobatic animations and sophisticated A.I. The only things that feel clunky to me are the enemy death animations and how the physics objects react.Like, when you hit an object with your wrench, it flies away jerkily through the air, as if you are viewing it at 10 FPS.\n\nNote:\nI would recommend saving every time before alt/shift + tabbing. The game sometimes crashed, when I did that. ( windows 7 64bit )\n\nFinal thoughts:\nThis was my first time playing through the original Bioshock and it is amazing.There is really alot of creativity and care put into this AAA game that you don't often see.Even if you own Bioshock 2 or Bioshock:Infinite (Infinite has nothing to do with Bioshock 1 and 2) I would still recommend playing it because of the story and how well the game has aged.","August 4, 2015","true","19.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","2"

It was impossible to build it anywhere else!"  says  Andrew Ryan . He knows what men capable of, after seeing Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He believes that world will go into nuclear war and he wanted to build a city away from the clutching hand of the  "Parasites" . So, the construction of Rapture began. A city where the artist would not fear the censor. Where the scientist would not be bound by petty morality. Where the great would not be constrained by the small.\n\nA man saw Ryan's utopian society as the perfect opportunity for a long but big-payoff con. Frank Fontaine, he knew what happened with utopias. When this undersea utopia fell apart, he wanted to be there, with a whole society to feast on.\n\nFontaine raised with the invention of plazmids which are special serums made from processed ADAM which allows genetic mutation , giving the user what some may call “super powers”. Plasmids are powerful, but excessive use of them leads to physical and mental addiction and instability. This was a major factor in the eventual downfall of Rapture society. But ofcourse it wasn’t the only reason, Ryan did lot of mistakes during that time. As he says; “The city... it is collapsing before my... have I become so convinced by my own beliefs that I have stopped seeing the truth? Perhaps”.\n\nAnd at this point, our game starts. Incredible story specially made for a video game. Amazing voice acting. Combat might get a bit repetetive after some point but not a major issue. Graphics is still acceptable for a game which has been released 9 years ago.\n\nLike Andrew Ryan says; "A man chooses a slave obeys".

Gameplay was good, the environment is literally breathtaking, and the story is magnificent.\n\nYou play as Jack, whose plane goes down in the middle of the Atlantic ocean near a lighthouse. The lighthouse is actually the gateway to the underwater city of Rapture. Or it ruins, anyway. Rapture, the brain child of industrialist Andrew Ryan, was supposed to be a paradise for the common man, but not all was well in paradise. Civil unrest, class warfare, and add unmonitored sciencetific discoveries to the mix and things got real very fast. Plasmids, tonics that give humans super powers so to speak, is powered by a substance called "ADAM". But it destroys the mind with repeated abuse and now it's aftermath roams the streets.\n\nWhen you arrive, you seem to be at the tail end of the Rapture Civil War (a war between classes which quickly turned into a game of "Who Can Splice More") and you are almost immedietly contacted by a man named Atlas, who promises to help you escape Rapture. Now you must navigate through the city to find a way out. But don't get too comfortable in this city. Not all is as it seems and everyone is trying to get their hands on you.\n\nWhat I loved most about BioShock is that the main story isn't the only story. You learn about the city, it's people, and what caused paradise to literally sink. You learn how far we as humans will go to get what we desire and just what lines some will cross to enhance the human race.\n\nAre you a man or a slave? A savior or a splicer?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neilbowski/recommended/7670/","neilbowski","Neilbowski","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neilbowski/","218 products in account","My favorite game from the 360/PS3 era.  When this came out it was a breath of fresh air in art direction and pacing.  The plot is amazing, including one of the best reveals in gaming when you meet Mr. Andrew Ryan.  You can explore a glorious underwater city that has gone from paradise to madness through the in game characters you meet and the audio journals you collect.  There are some real standout characters both from physical design and voice acting standpoints.  Who doesn't remember Sander Cohen after they play this game once!\nThe graphics still hold up today (just finished a playthrough 1/9/2014) with both the characters and backgrounds having great detail and art.  Enemies variation is good in the beginning, but repeat a little to often near the end, just as most shooters do.  Of course, the game has the iconic big daddy fights that are a lot of fun and a real challenge on hard difficulty.\nI don't think the actual shooting is anything too special,  You get pretty standard weapon choices (Pistol, machine gun, shotgun, rocket launcher, yawn, zzzzz)  but you do get a lot of cool spell type abilities called Plasmids and get to upgrade each weapon and Plasmid twice.  There are multiple ammo types for each gun as well as hackable enemies, so for what the shooting lacks in weight and badass weaponry it makes up for in sheer variety.  You can literally not play this game the same way twice.\nBe warned the graphics always seemed a little more glitchy on PC than it did on my dearly departed XBOX.  I've had occasional frame rate jumps and the electric chemical thrower would cause graphical glitches on my pair of playthroughs on PC.  Check the forums as this game can be a real pain to get working on your modern OS.\nThe game gets my highest recommendation.  You will see this for $5.00 every once in a while on Steam.  If you didn't buy it for that price you would be a damn fool.","January 10, 2014","true","20.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The entire location this game takes place in is impressive and until now rarely done in those times.\n\nBut the best part is story, yes the story is the most recommendable part. As the story is told via dialogue most of the time and the rare cutscenes are mostly done for the big reveals or intro's. This game was so good, I bought it when it was on sale and before I knew it I was 4 hours in and was far from bored and actualy had to force myself to stop playing to get some rest.\n\nIf you never played Bioshock..

Early in the article, Ebert firmly expresses his view on the matter: “Let me just say that no video gamer now living will survive long enough to experience the medium as an art form.” As much as I respect the late Roger Ebert, I have to disagree with this statement because gamers living today have survived to see at least one game rise above the rest as a work of art. The game in question is Bioshock, a first person shooter that combines exquisite storytelling, impressive presentation, and innovative gameplay into one cohesive unit that stands with any novel, painting, or movie as a piece of fine art.\nBioshock begins with the player’s character, a silent protagonist named Jack, surviving a plane crash in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. With nowhere else to go, Jack swims to a nearby islet occupied by a large lighthouse. Jack takes refuge inside the structure and discovers a small bathysphere that takes him to the game’s main setting, the massive underwater city of Rapture. According to a recording played in the bathysphere, Rapture was conceived by a business magnate named Andrew Ryan, who built the city with the vision of a utopian community where one could achieve greatness without any interference from outside forces, such as government or religion. However, upon arriving in Rapture, the player soon finds out that things did not go exactly as Ryan planned. The city now lies in ruin and all of its living residents have become murderous lunatics that lash out at anything that moves. Aided via radio by a mysterious man named Atlas, Jack must now explore rapture and escape with his life.\nWhat makes this game stand out from others is that the player has full control of Jack during the entire experience. By immediately relinquishing control, Bioshock immerses the player in a captivating tale of freewill and madness that slowly reveals itself over the course of the game. In addition to scripted events, such as the masterfully executed opening, the player can listen to audio logs left behind by the once sane citizens of Rapture. These optional logs give the player deeper insight into the lives of Rapture’s residents and the events that led to the city’s downfall.\nRyan himself adds philosophical depth to the game’s already rich narrative. He exudes ambition and unrelenting determination to his beliefs with a charisma that makes him one of the most memorable characters in all of gaming. His attitude towards government and religious officials, which he refers to as “parasites,” heavily mirrors the objectivist beliefs Ayn Rand expressed in novels like Atlas Shrugged. The inclusion of these philosophical themes elevates Bioshock above the stereotype that games produce stories with little to no substance. 	Unfortunately, the story’s only flaw, and the main drawback of the game in general, is the ending, which feels abrupt and underwhelming compared to the rest of the game. Luckily, the rest of the story makes up for the lackluster ending with some amazing plot twists that will stick with the player long after their experience with the game has concluded.\nIf Bioshock’s mesmerizing plot doesn’t draw the player into its world, then its unparalleled presentation will. Every inch of Rapture is painstakingly rendered with borderline obsessive attention to the tiniest details. Water realistically drips from the walls and ceilings. Neon signs flicker and short out. Cheerful announcements fall on deaf ears over the intercom. These fully realized details add to the idea that Rapture was once a thriving metropolis where people lived happy and fulfilling lives, making its current state of disrepair all the more heart wrenching. Furthermore, Bioshock exudes a distinct art direction rarely seen in games. Rapture’s consistent Art Deco style will generate a sense of appreciation for the artistry required to bring these environments to life.\nWhile Bioshock’s story and presentation already place it in a league of its own, the game truly shines in its innovations to traditional FPS gameplay. Throughout the game, the player gather’s a diverse arsenal of weapons, ranging from a pistol to a shotgun to a flamethrower. Aiming and firing each of these weapons feels natural and satisfying. Also, all of the weapons can be upgraded to increase their accuracy and damage among other traits.\nHowever, Bioshock deviates from FPS norms with the addition of plasmids. These genetic modifications provide the player with a wide variety of powers, such as setting enemies on fire, picking up and throwing large objects, and possessing enemies to have them fight on the player’s side. In order to obtain these perks, the player must collect a gene altering substance called ADAM from small girls called Little Sisters that freely roam Rapture’s halls. However, the player must first defeat the Little Sisters’ guardians, huge diving suit wearing creatures simply known as Big Daddies. These intimidating monsters deal massive damage and will take a long time to defeat, but the satisfaction and rewards make it worth the effort. Once the Big Daddy falls, the player has the option to either harvest the Little Sister, which gives the player more ADAM but kills the girl, or rescue it, which yields less ADAM but promises the player a future reward. These decisions not only affect the player’s access to plasmids but also have moral ramifications that play into how the game’s story unfolds. This morality based choice system not only presents the player with an interesting dilemma with tangible consequences, but also perfectly ties into the game’s overall themes of personal growth and freedom.\nWhen all of Bioshock’s elements come together into a singular piece, they form a thoroughly entertaining and thought provoking experience that only a work of art can provide. The story keeps players guessing and presents them with philosophical concepts that other games can only dream of expressing. The presentation engrosses players into a world so authentically realized that it becomes as deep and complex as any of the game’s characters. Finally, the multifaceted gameplay forces the players to make decisions that impact their individual endeavors in unexpected ways. If this is the only time gamers experience the medium as a true art form, I can easily say that Bioshock deserves that distinction. Whether you’re a seasoned gamer or a curious onlooker, you owe it to yourself to pick up this slice of gaming excellence.\n\n","October 7, 2015","true","23.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","2"

(~24 fps not much on screen and standing still, ~19 fps when there was lots on screen and tons of action, but it felt like 30 oddly and didn't really run into many huge gaping framerate dips)\n\nGameplay is near perfect, there are two ways you can engage your enemies, Plasmids and normal Weapons. Normal Weapons are your, well, normal weapons, like a machine gun, an oddly satisfying shotgun which I unfortunately rarely used, and a crossbow which I actually never used, probably due to the fact there was no ammo for the damn thing until the last level, where you can buy some in a vending machine, but that's a fat lot of use because that vending machine is right next to the final boss! Slightly less flawed, however, is the plasmids. Plasmids are useful tools that can shock enemies with lightning, light them on fire, freeze them, or summon a load of bees. Now, onto the flaws with the gameplay. First up is hacking, this is very useful, as you can hack security cameras and turrets to aid you against the enemies. Unfortunately, about halfway through the game hacking is near impossible just to hack something as simple as a vending machine, it also kills the pacing as you could be just about to hack as a enemy is shooting at you, then time stops completely as you hack. During my first ever playthrough of the game on the XBox 360, I only hacked once, and that was when you had to hack a Security Bot to progress. Second, is the wrench. It is immensely overpowered. From the second level of the game, you can pick up a tonic called Wrench Jockey which increases the wrench's damage. This tonic is the best in the game, as at the beginning, it takes about four hits to kill a Thuggish Splicer, and about six to kill a Leadhead Splicer. With the tonic, though, you can kill both in 1-2 hits. Wow.\n\nIgnoring the somewhat minor flaws with the gameplay above, this is a must-buy and is one of the best games EVER MADE, and would you believe it's nine years old already? I will note that if you own a Playstation 3, that version of Bioshock is the best, since it has a new difficulty setting called Survivor, along with PS3 exclusive dlc called the Challenge  Room which is not availible for PC or XBox 360. Now, that being said, would you kindly buy this game?","February 12","true","24.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

A gripping story line, amazing audio, and graphics. For being released in 2007, the graphics are on par with newer titles. With 20 hours of game play you will not be disappointed. Rapture is skillfully designed, and is truly a work of art. The dark environments are easy to get immersed in, and fit nicely in the horror genre. The game is based in the 1960s, and with the music and visuals you are reminded of that, but the game has a very futuristic feel.\n\nThere are plenty of weapons, as well as plasmids to use. Different weapons and plasmids work\nbest at defeating certain enemies.  But this game is not your standard shooter. With the ability\nto save up "Adam" to boost your skills, weapons and plasmids like a rpg, just not as complex.\nThere's also crafting involved with items you collect throughout the game, again not to the depth of a true rpg.\n\nYou have freedom to explore the confines of Rapture, and I suggest that you do. Be sure to pick up all the audio recordings to follow the story, as most of the story line plays out through these recordings. You will also find needed information in the recordings. You can replay all the recordings by using the "M" if you miss something or simply cannot hear what they are saying do to background noise.\n\nThe biggest downfall of this game, the originality, the dark and macabre world setting maybe too obscure for the average gamer to appreciate.\n\nIf you enjoy horror/survival games, then this is a definite must have, as well as a nice addition to any gamers collection.","December 30, 2013","true","26.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Usually, if I don't it's either because I love the game so much it's necessary for me to review it, or I dislike the game. Because unless they're patient (Which I am not) they have completed a playthrough and then put a negative review down. In this case, I chose the former. You've heard of the game. Gotten many nominations for best game of last generation. Obviously, I wouldn't consider it the best game of last gen (Mass Effect 2 and Skyrim. 'Nuff said) but it's quite amazing. I couldn't resist and had to review this now. I already know what happens next anyway. :/\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are impressive for a nearly 7 year old game. They still look beautiful, and when I take screenshots, they look great compared to other games. And because atmosphere is considered part of the "graphics" section of my reviews, I have reasons to add on. Bioshock is partially horror, but more of a story rich shooter. I won't talk about gameplay or story yet. The atmosphere is perfect. The whole time I've been playing, I thought, "Please get me to a nice place, please get me to a nice place..." and then I realize Splicers and Big Daddies are swarming the whole place. The game has an uncomfortable atmosphere, but it's quite amazing.\n\nGameplay\nThe game is a first person shooter. The style is similar to Valve's source engine games, get a few weapons, use scroll to get them, and you can't aim down the sights. Since I've played 400 hours on TF2, I'm used to the controls. Even if I didn't play TF2, I would've dealt with the controls. You can switch between weapons and plasmids, which are special powers run with EVE. It's used for puzzles on occasion, but mostly it's used to weaken the enemy significantly so you can go in for the final blow. The game so far is relatively balanced, none of the enemies really are intimidating until you encounter the Big Daddy. They're intimidating and will stop at nothing to kill you if you touch it or the Little Sister it protects. They're terrifying and monsterous. They also in a way decide your ending. They're probably the most difficult enemies in the game, excluding the final boss. You make decisions and decide Little Sisters' fates. You can rescue them for a good ending or harvest their ADAM and become stronger. One problem I have with the game, though is that it feels linear and it ruins the game a little bit, because I'd love to explore Rapture some more. Overall, the gameplay is pretty solid, along with some quick puzzles and decisions that affect the end of the game, it does not disappoint.\n\nStory\nThe story is absolutely amazing, but there's a huge event towards the end of the game. Would you kindly make sure I don't go out of hand with this next short overview of what happens? Your name is Jack. The year is 1960. Your plane crashed near a mysterious lighthouse. When you enter, you discover a machine. When you go in and pull the switch, you realize that you're in an underwater city ruled by "madman" Andrew Ryan called Rapture. It was corrupted by ADAM, which is a drug that makes people insane. A man named Atlas helps you and started the catchphrase "Would you kindly..." which became one of the biggest quotes in video game history. And let me warn you, once you get to "it" (Bioshock fans know what I mean) then your mind will be blown. Bioshock's story is one of the best, darkest, stories that ever appeared in the gaming world.\n\nAudio\nThe audio is probably the first weak point of the game, unfortunately. The voice actors did an average job with their roles, but th music fits in nicely. I would say Andrew Ryan had the best voice. He sounded terrifying, influential, and takes the role of the villain well. Sometimes, however, the voice actors seemed careless or it had the microphone sound, like the person was farther away. Unfortunately, it's not all that great, despite Bioshock being an amazing game.\n\nReplayability\nThe worst part of the game is the replaybility, but it's not really supposed to have strong replayability, seeing how linear Bioshock already is. There's two endings, you could play for both, but usually people just play one time and be done with it. Either way, Bioshock is still an unforgettable game.\n\nVerdict\nIn the end, with some pretty serious flaws like it being linear and the average voice acting.  However, based off of what I've seen so far, BIoshock is one amazing game and one you don't want to miss, horror fan or not. I highly recommend the game and can't wait to beat it. Now, would you kindly buy this game?\n\nGraphics- 9/10\nGameplay- 9/10\nStory- 9.5/10\nAudio- 5.5/10\nReplayability- 4.5/10\n\n.:8.9/10:.\n\n+Good gameplay\n+Amazing story\n+Outstanding visuals\n+Interesting weapon combos\n+Amazing quotes and plot twist\n+Intense Big Daddy battles\n\n-Linear\n-Average voice acting\n-Little replayability","July 12, 2014","true","4.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Good variety of weapons/abilities to choose from. I thoroughly enjoyed the ~12 hours it took me to beat it.\n\nPros:\n-Great combat mechanics. (Telekinesis was always fun)\n-Spooky environment/enemies.\n-Overall creepy presentation.\n\nCons:\n-You are thrust quite abruptly into the story of the game. There's little to no explanation when the game begins as to why you are a machine-gun wielding sorcerer. You'll figure it out as you go.\n-Difficulty is a little weird. Normal baddies are cake. Big-Daddys tended to wreck me. Thankfully you essentially have unlimited lives.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game to sadists, serial killers, scuba divers, and sorcerers. I'd also encourage you to 'Rescue' the Little Sisters as opposed to 'Harvesting' them. If you rescue them all, the ending is equal parts satisfaction and horror.","December 13, 2013","true","13.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The game takes place in a sub-oceanic city called Rapture. The city was created by an entrepreneur by the name of Andrew Ryan who created the city with the idea that anyone could be great and do amazing things if they worked hard for it. The city used to be a revolutionary society populated by the best and brightest but now it's filled with splicers,people who have used too much Adam and have gone insane because of it. Adam is a sort of drug produced by a type of sea slug and it functions as a sort of cancer-like disease that replaces native cells with unstable stem versions. Adam is what makes the wheels of rapture turn and you use it to buy new plasmids or upgrade abilities at a gatherers garden shop. Plasmids are basically spells you can use and your "mana" pool is called eve. There are so many different kinds of plasmids that they make combat incredibly fun and varied as well. Each plasmid is unique and no two will feel the same. Bioshock also has Gene Tonics, which are basically just passives that fall under 1 of 3 categories: Physical, Engineering, or Combat. Each tonic offers helpful passive bonuses that can completely alter how you decide to play the game. For example, if you pick up the right tonics then you can basically turn Bioshock into a stealth game. The entirety of Bioshock is incredibly creepy but honestly I never got truly scared due to the fact that the developers included only 2-3 jumpscares and opted to use legitimate horror rather than these cheap alternatives.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=587209176\n\nAs I mentioned before Bioshock is an FPS which means that you're going to be doing lot's of shooting and boy is it fun. The guns in Bioshock don't really feel that good and almost all of them have very poor control and are hard to aim with.  Bioshocks main strength comes from the enemies and the weapons that you can wield. There are loads of different enemies to fight,each with varying strength and you will have a plethora of weapons to slay them with. Weapons from a chemical thrower loaded with napalm to a shotgun with electric rounds every weapon serves a purpose and as you progress you'll begin to find that out. Each weapon has different ammo types that can be loaded in to the weapon such as proximity mines for the grenade launcher or AP rounds for the machine gun. There are U-Invent stations spread throughout the levels and at these stations you can craft various new items such as new plasmids or ammo types. About halfway through the game you get the camera and this will allow you to take pictures of enemies and for taking these pictues you gain bonuses. For example, if you take pictures of the Big Daddies then you can unlock extra damage and loot to use against them. This is an incredibly unique system and really enhances the combat with all sorts of bonuses to keep in mind. This brings me to my main problem with the combat in Bioshock: Its old. Now don't get me wrong I love old games because most the time they're just flat out better games but here the old and dated controls really kills the game in parts. The options menu  is fairly lacking and the graphics options may cause some problems but my main issue is the sensitivity. The sensitivity completely ♥♥♥♥ed me over in combat because it's always too high and there isn't a good scale built into the game. No matter what I did even on the lowest it was still too fast for me and ruined combat half the time. Now,when you die you respawn at a Vita-Chamber with no penalty. This may be seen as too easy but due to how dated this game feels I think it allows people to advance through this amazing game no matter what and not be held back by dated controls and gameplay.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=587209283\n\n"Plasmids changed everything. They destroyed our bodies, our minds; we couldn't handle it. Best friends butchering one another, babies strangled in cribs... the whole city went to Hell."                                              -Atlas\n\nSo you may know Bioshock as a game with one of the biggest twists of all time and a story to match. Bioshock's story is absolutely phenomenal and borders on perfect with it's deep characters, unique setting, and one of the best twists in gaming history. The story is amazing on it's own but you soon come to realise that every single thing in Rapture has it's own story to it. The splicers have a story, the Vita-Chamber you respawn in has a story, and , most importantly of all, you have a story. Spread about Rapture are audio diaries which are little audio recordings that shed light on what Rapture truly is and how it came to be such a decrepit pit at the bottom of the ocean.Rapture's environments are some of the best I have ever seen, especially for a game thats 9 years old. You experience a variety of levels and environment types throughout your time in Rapture and every one is memorable and unique. You also begin to get the feeling that, contrary to what Ryan says, Rapture is falling apart all around you and there's nothing you do but make it worse. Also the level design in Bioshock is so perfect that you can't help but look around. Each level has loads of little nooks and side areas where you can pick up a new Tonic or type of ammo. Eventually you'll piece together what really happened and then just when you think you have it all figured out, it all gets thrown on it's head as everything around you begins to fall apart.\n\nTL;DRBioshock is an absolute masterpiece of a game that will leave you aching for more of it's revolutionary storytelling and creative combat mechanics.\n\nIf you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to join my Steam Curator Group at  Mudkips Gaming","January 8","true","78.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

A first person shooter with RPG elements and a knack for scaring you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\n+The graphics look beautiful for a game that came out in 2007. Sure the textures aren't great, and the characters are a little cartoony, but everything about the aesthetic of this game helps to fully set the atmosphere. And take my word for it, this is one of the most immersive games I have played in a very long time when it comes to the atmosphere.\n+The soundtrack is phenomenal. It fits every single scene. It helps draw you into the game. It can make even a bathroom that lacks jump scares the most terrifying place you've ever tip-toed your way into.\n+The level design is fantastically done, if poorly translated onto a 2D map. The underwater city of rapture has a mild claustrophobic feeling to it, but it makes sense. It fits the setting quite well, and when you need space? You can usually find or make it.\n+The story is fantastic, Ken Levine does wonders with stories. Draw dropping plot twists and endings that'll leave you speechless, i loved every second of it. There isn't a story in the world Ken Levine could write that I could forget.\n+Decent-length. Got 21 hours out of the game after getting it for $1 in a bundle. Definitely worth the price. I was partially a completionist however, I explored almost every single room and shelf in Rapture. I also moved very slowly at points since I scare easy.\n+Since the tags say it's horror, I can tell you it really does horror right. Jump-scares when you least expect them. And a very creepy atmosphere that doesn't rely on jump scares to begin with.\n-Respawning enemies. Just...ugh. Bioshock as a series is infamous for throwing enemies, and bullet sponges at you. If it bothers you, play on a lower difficulty, you'll become a bullet sponge yourself.\n-Bugs with Win7 or later. From random crashes (That lead to all of your settings resetting) to the sounds cutting out when too make sound sources are coming in at once. Most noticeable when guardians of rapture (Sounds better than dinky flying robots) are shooting. Especially noticeable towards the end of the game. Immersion-breaking to say the least...but not game-breaking.\n\nAll in all, this game holds up. I'm very glad I made my easy-to-scare ♥♥♥ finish the game, as it was totally worth it. Keeping its buggy state and flaws in mind, I give this game an 4/5. I think this is a game that everyone who enjoys a good immersive story should play. Were the bugs fixed, I'd give it a 9/10, so maybe a console version might fare better for you. Either way, I have to admit that it is an amazing game and it has defined the standards for the horror FPS genre. Now, would you kindly consider giving it a try? =)","September 19, 2015","true","21.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

So i'll also try my best to 'stylize' my 'review formula':\n\nRapture.\nTruly, this amazing underwater city defines everything this game does well. From the very start, you feel like Alice, going into the rabbit hole, into Wonderland... Except you're late for this one, it's already in ruins.\nThe art style is absolutely amazing, the 20's Art Déco combined with the sci fi / mechanical aspects results in a sense of confusion, not knowing if you're in the past or future, which adds to the mysterious tone of the ruined city.\n\nThe combat system is also very refreshing, instead of just relying on weapons, they added plasmids, which can be mixed with the guns for fun gameplay, with an added layer of depth. The exploration and scavenging were a nice surprise for me (as an obsessive explorer in gaming), presenting both some RPG elements and the backstory of the city, before it collapsed (metaphorically), through the eyes of its previous inhabitants.\nAnother unique, iconic element of the game is it's enemies, more specifically the almighty Big Daddy, who provides an amazing dynamic to the combat (i was gonna describe it, but i decided it's best to let the players found out for themselves).\n\nFinally we reach the Story, praised as one of the best in videogames, proving that FPS's dont have to be mindless with virtually no story (you guys know what games im talking about!), by presenting complex philosophical, moral and political ideas, as an amazing social commentary that should probably be studied and debated by the experts of those departments. All of this, with a limited amount of characters, that you can count witth the fingers in your hands. But even though few, each counts as a hundred, with powerful personalities crashing, which results in the infamous plot twists that catapulted this game into stardom.\n\nNow, would you kindly do yourself a favor, and go play this game immediately, if you havent yet (or even if you have!)\n","October 28, 2014","true","0.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Its combat can be repetitive, but with the assortment of plasmids with the conventional weapons at your disposal, the game never gets boring; rather the further you advance, the deeper you become engrossed in the story, especially if you take the time to find and listen to all of the audio logs.\nRapture is one of the best worlds i have experienced, and with the Big Daddy and Little Sister characterisation and relationship, amongst many other things,  Bioshock is truly unforgetable.\nA classic.","December 3, 2013","true","13.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's polished, gritty, tense and sometimes frightening. It's also quite wordy and philosophical. There's a lot to like here. The sound, especially, is amazing, and the graphics are beautiful.\n\nThe game promises a "play it your way" experience, and succeeds, to a point. The many plasmids (think "spells") encourage you to try different tactics, but the very first combo you learn is the easiest and most effective: shock your opponent, and then bludgeon him with a wrench while he's stunned. It’s generally easy to identify a best plasmid to use for each situation; although you can explore others.\n\nI should also point out that this game is psychologically very taxing. You spend a great deal of time looting dead, mangled, burned corpses. You're crawling through a destroyed city. The game is oppressive and claustrophobic, and seriously depressing. I was glad when it was over, but also glad to have played it. Difficult at the time, but it left a lasting impression.","January 29, 2011","true","21.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mstrchiefalexed/recommended/7670/","mstrchiefalexed","Stadarooni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mstrchiefalexed/","75 products in account","Would you kindly read this review and buy this game?\n\nIf you didn't know, BioShock is claimed to be one of the most revolutionary FPS's games of all time, and that statement has plently of truth to it. It exceeds in almost all areas, but no gem is without its flaws. Unfortunately for BioShock, these flaws can be quite noticeable when you come across to them. DO NOT let that discourage you from playing this game though; it's an experience you don't want to miss.\n\nIn terms of presentation, BioShock fails to unimpress. The view of the underwater city of Rapture will amaze you when it emerges on your screen, and the steampunk art style is very unique, while being consistent throughout the game. Voice acting is perfect without a doubt, and characters such as Ryan Andrew and Sander Cohen will leave a lasting impression long after you finish the game. Sound design is extremly well-done as well: the whale-like moans from the hulking Big Daddies are very creepy, and the game only uses music for atmospheric reasons, adding an extra layer of immersion that makes the game quite screepy, but never outright scary (which is not what the game is trying to do).\n\nThe story is the main highlight of BioShock, and presents themes and ideologies that are very applicable to reality, mainly the view of objectivism. Plot twists and unforgetable characters will make the experience a memorable ones, and each audio-diary will flesh out the world of Rapture, especially in events following up to the game. As for the main protagonist Jack, he's the typical silent playable character that every shooter seems to have, but his background information makes him quite interesting. Despite this, the story is damned near perfect, even if it feels ever-so rushed after the games huge revelation and twist.\n\nI could end the review here, as the story is something that alone should be able to sell this game instantly, no strings attached. However, how does BioShock sell as an FPS? The game features an arsenal of weapons from a flamethrower to a machine gun, and are all quite standard. The sense of conserving ammo that the game has at first is very intense, however later on you will have more money than you even need, so that feeling is somewhat lost. Gunplay feels slightly "floaty" (can't really get my finger on what it is), and later on becomes quite inneffective against enemies that suddenly have increased durability from earlier in the game. Speaking of enemies, you'll encounter Splicer's, humans which are addicted to this substance called ADAM, which grants them superpowers but makes them mentally unstable. Some will teleport around you, while others will have a box of grenades to utilize instead. But most significant of all are the Big Daddies.\n\nThese hulking beasts present a real challenge, but are neutral if not dealt with. Why? They guard Little Sisters. which are key to the games plot and whether you get a good or bad ending. These altered girls harvest ADAM from dead corpses (and have a creepy sense of innocence to them), and you have the option to either save them or harvest them. Saving leads to the good ending but you get less ADAM, and harvesting them leads to the bad ending but you get more ADAM (and a combination leads to the sad ending). Actually combating the Big Daddies leads to a great deal of planning, and you'll have to acknowledge that you wont come out of the fight without a few scars.\n\nGoing backwards, do you recall how I noted how guns became less useful as the game progresses? Well, that is because of Plasmids, which are basically superpowers like shooting flames, bolts of electricity, or even a swarm of bees! These are incredibly fun to use. een though you have to switch to your Plasmids and use them independantly from your weapons, making combat feel slightly clunky. The game also presents you with many RPG features, such as a hacking minigame (meh), weapon/plasmid upgrades, shops, ammo types, and plenty of nooks and cranies to add to it all. Overall combat is slightly outdated by todays standards (no sprint or ADS, if such a thing would bother you), but is still incredibly fun regardless.\n\n\n\nSLIGHT GAMEPLAY SPOILERS AHEAD\n\n\n\nAnd here is a warning to where the game goes wrong. Following the huge plot twist at the end of the second third of the game, the gameplay plummets (pun intended) downhill, even though it may not seem so at first. It places some annoying restrictions on your abilities, but that's where the fun begins. After that you have a boring and confusing (IMO) scavenger hunt, and after that an incredibly dull escort mission before a forgetable (but not as bad as the scavenger hunt) final boss. To be fair, the only part that really stuck out as bad to me was the scavenger hunt: everything before it was annoying but still fun, and after it forgetable. The audio diaries and story will certainly make up for it however, as the games presentation remains consistent throughout.\n\nBioShock is a prime example of how video games are art, and is one you should not overlook. Even where it missteps in gameplay, it's story and presentation are grand throughout, and provide a unique experience you will not forget and will come back to again and again. There is no denying that BioShock is a game that will stand the test of time, and I would give it a 9/10 (If it was story alone than 11/10, it's that good).\n\nSo, would you kindly get it?","February 6, 2015","true","9.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Fortunately I decided against my bias and purchased this one.\n\nOne thing I love about Bioshock, is the way it tells or rather shows you the story and events in Rapture. Infinite in my humble opinion felt way too scripted, and it bugged me, how often that particular game took away my control over Bookers' character. Bioshock instead opts for a different way of handling this aspect by letting me, the player decide wether I want to give attention to a cutscenes or not, what I really like. Bioshock also features a very engaging story, that might surprise you.\n\nDespite a somewhat "antique" Unreal Engine 2, the game is a stunner, providing incredible (and unsettling) setpieces. Unfortunately ragdoll and physic animations are capped at 30FPS which really makes them stick out like a sore thumb. The games' biggest problem however are the low FOV and the ridiculously low weapon FOV, which made me motionsick after 5 minutes of playtime. This can be avoided by using a tool called "Flawless Widescreen" which allows the user to customize both options. Irrational Games did a great job on Bioshocks artdesign which still holds up even to this date. The music and soundeffects are well done and provide a good atmosphere.\n\nBioshocks gunplay is alright. The player is given a rather large arsenal of weaponary and plasmids. The guns felt a bit too weak, which turned some enemies into frustrating bulletsponges. My favourites are the wrench and the shotgun, which I found useful for all situations they game would throw at me. Plasmids are integrated well into the gameplay and are lots of fun to use, even though "Elektroshock" turned out to be a bit too OP (extremely handy for foighting Big Daddies).\n\nI do have an issue with the health system. Even with a full inventory of health kits, I happened to die alot because there is little to no feedback when you're low on health. The bar isn't visible enough due to its rather small size and is in my opinion badly positioned (upper left corner). It would have been nice if the player was given the option to customize the HUD to their likings.\n\nThe game happened to run very badly on my PC. It crashed alot, never saved my settings and featured horrid mouse acceleratrion issues. The DX10 features are responsible for Bioshock not working properly on newer machines, I advise to set the game to DX9 (add "-dx9" to the start options). Fixes for this game can be found on the PCGamingWiki.\n\nI had a lot of fun with Bioshock and can safely recommend it to anyone who like to play First Person Shooters.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIch war Anfangs etwas skeptisch über dieses Spiel, da ich Infinite vorher gespielt und nicht genossen habe. Gott sei Dank habe ich mich aber letztendlich doch zum Kauf des ersten Teils entschieden.\n\nWas mir an Bioshock sehr gefällt, ist die Art und Weise, wie die Geschichte und die Geschehnisse in Rapture erzählt oder besser, gezeigt werden. Infinite hatte meiner Meinung zuviele geskriptete Szenen, was mich sehr genervt hat, da mir einfach zu oft die Kontrolle über Booker entnommen wurde. Bioshock hingegen verzichtet auf diese Vorgehensweise und lässt den Spieler entscheiden, ob er einer Cutscene beiwohnen möchte oder nicht, was ich sehr begrüße. Zudem wartet das Spiel mit einer sehr fesselnden Handlung auf, welche den einen oder anderen zu überraschen vermag.\n\nTrotz veralteter Unreal Engine 2 sieht das Spiel fantastisch aus. Man bekommt sehr schöne (zum Teil auch sehr schaurige) Setpieces geboten. Ragdoll und Physikanimationen werden nur in 30FPS dargestellt, was nicht ins Gesamtbild passen möchte und schlecht aussieht. Das größte Problem des Spiels ist jedoch die niedrige FOV sowie das viel zu niedrige Waffen-FOV. Nach nur 5 Minuten habe ich große Übelkeit verspürt. Das Programm "Flawless Widescreen" ist hier zu empfehlen, mit dem man beide FOV-Optionen nach Belieben anpassen kann. Das Artdesign von Bioshock ist Irrational Games sehr gut gelungen und lässt das Spiel auch heute noch gut aussehen. Die Musik und Soundeffekte passen gut in das Spiel rein und verleihen es eine solide Atmospähre.\n\nBioshocks' Gunplay ist passabel. Es wird dem Spiel ein üppiges Aresnal an Feuerwaffen und Plasmiden geboten. Die Feuerwaffen sind meiner Meinung nach etwas zu schwach, was einige Gegner zu echten Bulletsponges gemacht hat. Meine Favoriten waren die Rohrzange und die Schrotflinte, welche sich bei allen Situationen bewährt haben. Plasmide sind gut eingebunden und machen extrem viel Spaß anzuwenden, wobei die Fähigkeit "Elektroshock" doch ziemlich overpowered ist (extrem hilfreich gegen Big Daddies).\n\nEin Kritikpunkt den ich habe ist das Gesundheitssystem. Trotz reichlichen Vorrat an Verbandskästen bin ich häufig abgekratzt aufgrund fehlendem Feedback bei niedriger Gesundheitsanzeige. Die Anzeige im HUD ist nicht gerade groß und meiner Meinung nach flasch positioniert (oben links). Wäre ganz nett gewesen, wenn man das HUD umgestalten könnte.\n\nDas Spiel hat am Anfang auf meinem Rechner Probleme gemacht. Es stürzte oft ab, hat meine Einstellungen nicht gespeichert und hatte extrem gräßliche Mausbeschleunigung. Die DX10 Features verursachen Probleme auf neuen Rechnern, deshalb rate ich Bioshock im DX9 Modus zu spielen ("-dx9" in die Startoptionen einfügen). Im PCGamingWiki findet man alle Informationen und Fixes für das Spiel.\n\nIch hatte auf jeden Fall sehr viel Spaß mit Bioshock und kann es jedem Spieler, der First Person Shooter mag, empfehlen.","December 26, 2014","true","11.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

In my journey through the game I've found myself much more interested in discovering the city's secrets and history than advancing the main plot. It's Ayn Rand's special halloween episode and it's great. The gameplay is a bit clumsy and I felt that were too many clashing systems that don't quite work together well. Still, it's one of the best games from last generation and I feel everyone should give it a try.","December 2, 2014","true","17.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

One mysterious plane crash later, you're floating in the water, apparently the lone survivor, surrounded by the flaming wreckage of the aircraft. But there's a lighthouse on a tiny island just at the edge of your view.Your only chance is to get there.and so you do.inside,you find a submersible called bathysphere,which only purpose is to get you into the void of the sea.You don't have a choice,so you pull the trigger,the door closes,and you get down...down..There you find a secret city,underwater,named Rapture.An underwater city created by Andrew Ryan,with her own rules,her own freedom.However,everything has gone completely wrong.The city is vandalised,destroyed,and deadly lunatics roam the paths of Rapture.Apart from the phreaks,little girls named ''little sisters'' who contain the corrupting substance called ADAM move through the city with their ''protectors'' ''Big Daddies'',some people with a huge armor.\n\nGameplay : 9/10\nCharacter Customization.nope,i dont mean you can change your appearance,however,you can find ''magical powers'' which can be shot out of your fingers,elemental powers such as electricity,Ice,fire,wind,even BEES (no,not the bees).Those powers consume EVE(mana).You can use your powers to control your enemies against your other enemies,you can use them to gain control of machines such as turrets.\nAlso,you got a variety of purchasable talents,which variety from Engineering,Physical,and Combat talents.each kind of talents got a different use,for example there's a physical talents which makes you swing your melee weapon faster.You start with 2 slots for every category of talents,and you can purchase more from a Gatherer's Garden .\nThere are 8 types of weapons,1 melee,6 guns,and a camera,which doesnt deal any damage,however it is used to take photographs of your enemies,so you can learn more about them and find new methods of dealing with them.There are 3 types of bullets for every gun,the normals,the armor penetration ones (against machines and big daddies) and the Antipersonnel ones which are useful against lunatics etc. You are also able to find weapon upgrade machines,which will make your weapons more powerful.\nYou can hack vents,safes,or even turrets to help you defeat your enemies.There are 2 types of ''money'' the normal money,and the consumable ADAM which give you new powers or slots or even higher health.ADAM can be used on a different kind of vent,the Gatherer's Garden.You can consume ADAM from the little sister,by either saving them(you will earn less,however everytime you complete a series of 3 ''rescues'' you will earn a surprise),or killing them.Finally,You collect audio logs which help you understand more whats going on.\n\nGraphics : 8/10\nI cant say i went crazy about the graphics,however Bioshock got some nice atmosphere.\n\nControls : 8/10\nEasy Enough,however at the begining i got a little confused.\n\nAudio : 10/10\nIncredible voice acting,making the game stick greatly with the plot.Great soundtracks,but the thing i loved about the audio,is the music which plays when you rescue a little sister.its both beautiful and cute.","May 26, 2014","true","11.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As far as horror sci-fi shooter goes, this one comes with a really intricate background and very good story telling. The world is absorbing and Rapture as an underwater city seems believeable with the ideology of a capitalist despot during the post WWII era refreshing yet sort of expected from that time. The content is awesome, but the controls is a tad bit clunky compared to modern FPS and the map is just horrendous to look at and use. Mind you, this was published around 10 yrs ago. The metascore on this one is accurate. A very good game indeed and great atmosphere with a compelling story.

My favorite part of the game is obtaining the ADAM, by fighting against the enchanced giants Bid Daddies (seen in the picture), and they're the guardians of the Little Sisters. Although I've played on the Hard difficulty, the easiest part of the entire game was the final boss.\n\nSo, 8.5/10 for having the ability of combining logically realistic weapons with inhuman plasmid abilities and gene tonics, to make combos.

This may be +, since it is not as linear as most games nowadays, but it can get annoying.\n- Voice acting is not very well made\n- Subtitles are different than voice, so if you like to play with subs on, it can get confusing\n- NPCs have too few lines they keep repeating, which can be annoying... I used to be an adventurer like you...\n- You will save a lot\n\nIf you still keep reading despite those minor setbacks, here is why the game is awesome\n+ The story, despite being confusing at first, will be explained throughout this game with a few awesome nad unexpected plot twists.\n+ The world continues in newer games, that I recommend to play, too. So if you like this game, you have more to look forward to\n+ The atmosphere is well made\n+ The gameplay itself is great, and quite intuitive. The game mechanics are good, too.\n+ You choose how to play - melee or ranged? Traps and smart play or full out assault? Kill everything you see or spare some lives? (this is slightly taken into consideration for the ending sequence)\n+ I did not encounter any bugs or crashes, running on PC win7 64bit.\n\nThere is one problem with this game when you ALT+TAB that a lot of people complain about. It can get stuck in window-mode. However, this can be easily fixed by pressing ALT+ENTER once or twice.\n\nSo do I recommend this game? It is too old to pay full price for, but if it is on sale, yes, definitely. You will not regret it.\n\nNow, would you kindly make the purchase?","December 27, 2014","true","14.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Bioshock, is able to capture the fun of running, and gunning your oponents down, as a game, and is able to succeed that as an art.\n\nGame wise, fairly standard assortment of guns, early to mid 1900's themed. Interesting twist yes? Now throw in rag-tag modifcations to guns, a plethora of different ammo that does everything from explode on impact to cause massive electrical damage. Then throw in almost supernatural powers, with a wide variety of character augmentations, to help you adapt to the changing environment. Want to run at 500% speed hitting people with a wrench in the back that freezes them solid, and you can become invisable- Bioshock has that.\n\nThese augmentations to the self are not just a gameplay feature, they are a core feature of the games narrative. The game itself portrays a distopian underwater city, that, as you are forced to enter seemingly, without your own choice in the matter, forces you to see what has happened. It forces you to take on this role, and realise who the real villain of the situation is, who or what is the real monster behind sociatal collapse and anarchy. Everything in the game seemingly has a suitable purpose to back up a part of the narrative, and it works, because nothing is then ever out of place. The game is able to form a cohesive structure, that despite its debatable ending, creates a wonderful philosophical experiance.\n\nThere are those that this game is a dumbed down System Shock 2, or even a console port that is meant for lesser gamers. But until we look at games in their individuality, we cant see the shine each one brings to the table. Bioshock, as a single product is simply an amazing game, that is a must own for any gamer.","September 10, 2013","true","15.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","6"

Yes, I said it. I don't say that about just any game. I saw friends casually playing this game years ago, and I always thought the Big Daddies you see everywhere looked pretty cool, but I never considered playing it due to its lack of hype. When I saw all three games go on sale as a package for 15$ on the Steam Holiday sale I had to do some research, because who can beat three full games for 15 bucks? Upon reading I found that people were upset at Bioshock Infinite's lack of quality compared to its predecessors, and the passion people had for the first two made the deal seem irresistable. I bought it and was instantly captivated by the creepy and atmospheric city of Rapture. I have only just begun playing the second game, but this game here is a masterpiece. P.S., if you play this, SEARCH FOR THE AUDIO LOGS! You're missing half of the game's beauty and story/immersiveness if you completely ignore these recordings that are scattered about rapture.\n\nBUY THIS GAME.","January 7, 2014","true","20.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

One mysterious plane crash later, you're floating in the water, apparently the lone survivor, surrounded by the flaming wreckage of the aircraft. But there's a lighthouse on a tiny island just at the edge of your view.Your only chance is to get there.and so you do.inside,you find a submersible called bathysphere,which only purpose is to get you into the void of the sea.You don't have a choice,so you pull the trigger,the door closes,and you get down...down..There you find a secret city,underwater,named Rapture.An underwater city created by Andrew Ryan,with her own rules,her own freedom.However,everything has gone completely wrong.The city is vandalised,destroyed,and deadly lunatics roam the paths of Rapture.Apart from the phreaks,little girls named ''little sisters'' who contain the corrupting substance called ADAM move through the city with their ''protectors'' ''Big Daddies'',some people with a huge armor.\n\nGameplay : 9/10\nCharacter Customization.nope,i dont mean you can change your appearance,however,you can find ''magical powers'' which can be shot out of your fingers,elemental powers such as electricity,Ice,fire,wind,even BEES (no,not the bees).Those powers consume EVE(mana).You can use your powers to control your enemies against your other enemies,you can use them to gain control of machines such as turrets.\nAlso,you got a variety of purchasable talents,which variety from Engineering,Physical,and Combat talents.each kind of talents got a different use,for example there's a physical talents which makes you swing your melee weapon faster.You start with 2 slots for every category of talents,and you can purchase more from a Gatherer's Garden .\nThere are 8 types of weapons,1 melee,6 guns,and a camera,which doesnt deal any damage,however it is used to take photographs of your enemies,so you can learn more about them and find new methods of dealing with them.There are 3 types of bullets for every gun,the normals,the armor penetration ones (against machines and big daddies) and the Antipersonnel ones which are useful against lunatics etc. You are also able to find weapon upgrade machines,which will make your weapons more powerful.\nYou can hack vents,safes,or even turrets to help you defeat your enemies.There are 2 types of ''money'' the normal money,and the consumable ADAM which give you new powers or slots or even higher health.ADAM can be used on a different kind of vent,the Gatherer's Garden.You can consume ADAM from the little sister,by either saving them(you will earn less,however everytime you complete a series of 3 ''rescues'' you will earn a surprise),or killing them.Finally,You collect audio logs which help you understand more whats going on.\n\nGraphics : 8/10\nI cant say i went crazy about the graphics,however Bioshock got some nice atmosphere.\n\nControls : 8/10\nEasy Enough,however at the begining i got a little confused.\n\nAudio : 10/10\nIncredible voice acting,making the game stick greatly with the plot.Great soundtracks,but the thing i loved about the audio,is the music which plays when you rescue a little sister.its both beautiful and cute.","May 26, 2014","true","11.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As far as horror sci-fi shooter goes, this one comes with a really intricate background and very good story telling. The world is absorbing and Rapture as an underwater city seems believeable with the ideology of a capitalist despot during the post WWII era refreshing yet sort of expected from that time. The content is awesome, but the controls is a tad bit clunky compared to modern FPS and the map is just horrendous to look at and use. Mind you, this was published around 10 yrs ago. The metascore on this one is accurate. A very good game indeed and great atmosphere with a compelling story. It is truly a worthwhile experience for anyone who is into sci-fi and don't mind a little bit of horror elements (not ghost, just biomedical mutants).","March 4, 2014","true","12.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

My favorite part of the game is obtaining the ADAM, by fighting against the enchanced giants Bid Daddies (seen in the picture), and they're the guardians of the Little Sisters. Although I've played on the Hard difficulty, the easiest part of the entire game was the final boss.\n\nSo, 8.5/10 for having the ability of combining logically realistic weapons with inhuman plasmid abilities and gene tonics, to make combos. Big Daddies, which are splitted into Bouncer (drill guy) and Rosie (guy with rifle-ish nail gun), and their Little Sisters, but negative points for easy final boss fight and a play-once game (unless you like to combine different combos).","June 27, 2013","true","15.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

This turned to be one of my best gaming-related decisions so far.\nFrom the intro, the game had me captivated. I immediately loved the atmosphere of Rapture, with its amazing art-deco architecture, and various locations (after all years since its release, the game still looks great), I could almost feel how it must have felt to walk in the shoes of the protagonists. This feeling was further enhanced by the music... Ohh yes, the music. Nothing builds an eerie atmosphere better than hearing a pleasant old-shool song, played as if from a vinyl disc, while exploring a blood-stained, ruined city.\nThe game mechanics? Here, there is little to mention apart from the fact that it's a solid, well-balanced shooter with some RPG entwined in it. You;ll have plenty of weapons, plasmids and genetic upgrades along the game but when all is said and done, you will end up using your three favourites. Hacking mini-games get a tiny bit boring after some time, but you can easily skip some of them with the help of items found along the way.\nAs far as graphics are concerned, I can only say that Irrational Games made wonders with Unreal Engine 3 and even now, even with almost minimum level of details, the game looks great.\nStorywise, as far as video games are concerned - it's a masterpiece. If you don't play BioShock, you're missing out on a great story. and that's notwithstanding the fact that after the main plot twist (somewhere aobut 3/4 of a game) the plot loses its momentum a little.\n\nQuick summary of advantages:\n+amazing design and atmosphere of Rapture\n+great soundtrack (music and voiceover alike)\n+easy to master, entertaining combat with many possibilities to take down enemies\n+brilliant storyline and memorable characters\n+the game graphics did not age much\nSome disadvantages:\n-rubbish map, unintuitive journal (although you won't use the latter too much)\n-if you don't like it - can give you a jump sometimes\n-only a few types of enemies\n-some artificial limitations - money cap, no plasmid+weapon combo...\n\nOne additional thought. If you're anxious that BioShock might be too scary for your tastes: don't worry. Just pluck up the courage and force yourself through the first two locations (like I had to :D) and from there, it will go al lot smoother. There are much fewer scary moments in the further part of the game and when they do appear, you will be able to predict them with ease.\nSo, coming back to the start: play BioShock, enjoy the story. You won't regret it and the memory of Rapture will stay with you for long.","May 15, 2014","true","31.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game is fantastic in all apsects: Story presentation, music, the enviroments, the diaries slowly feeding you information. Gunplay and plasmids form a strong FPS core without feeling overhwleming. Really, all I can complain about is that if I have to play one more ♥♥♥♥ing game of pipe dreams I will take a wrench to someone's face. But in the end, everything comes together to form something much greater than the sum of its parts: Rapture.

Basically you just hold the LMB and just wait for the health bar to drop down.\n* Felt like it dragged on slightly.\n* The "moral" system is just basically a "Gandhi or Hitler" type of thing.\n* Food, drinks and substances like cigarettes can't be carried with you.\n* Some pickups are just objectively bad. No real trade offs with a lot of them.\n* On modern systems it can run like ♥♥♥♥, so you might have to remove shadows and things like that + mess around in the config files.\n\nOverall:\n7.5/10","June 3","true","8.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Then I got my hands on the PC version, and I'm starting to see why people like it so much.\n\nThe world is a massive breath of fresh air from the done-to-death Middle Easts and Europes of the world. But that's not what's best about it. The atmosphere is simply amazing. It's a rare feat for a game to make me *feel* the world around the player, and BioShock does it. Add to that gameplay that's simple, but works rather well (apart from plasmids being a bit overpowered) and a pretty well-written story, and you have a recipe for success.","December 24, 2010","true","10.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Splicers are people who got addicted to the plasmids and went crazy and you will see a lot of them throughout the game, just listening to them you can see how far gone they are.\n\nThe story is really amazing about the rise and fall of Rapture, there are audio tapes that are actually really interesting if you take the time to listen and the BIG DADDY fights are great, you are fighting these huge things with drills for hands that just want to protect their little sisters in their eyes, splicers want to drain the sisters EVE to use plasmids by killing them, If you're not prepared these can kill you in seconds.\n\nThe game lasts over 12 hours and not one part wasn't unique or frustrating.\nI would give this a 10/10, this is still one of my favourite games ever.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crazygpu2/recommended/7670/","crazygpu2","CrazyGPU without GPU...","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crazygpu2/","184 products in account","Bioshock is first-person shooter action game developed by Irrational Games, 2K known as Boston / Australia in 2007.\n\nThe game takes place in the 60s. The player, Jack survives a plane crash and reaches the underwater city Rapture found in decay. There he must fight against mutated humans and capture the substance called ADAM inside little girls called Little Systers that are defended by powerful Divers called Big Daddies. This substance will let the player acquire genetic improvements .\n\nBioshock was really surprising because it created a whole new world with incredible narrative. history is noteworthy . Despite maps are not huge, they have superlative art and there are so many things to do that you never get bored . Combat is frenetic, there are turrets and machines to be hacked that provide ammunition and resources , there are also hidden resources and tonics to search that provide a remarkable range of combat.\n\nInstead of just owning guns, machine guns, etc. , we find tonics fire , electric rays, clouds of bees or many other forms of attack. This mixed mechanism was fairly new and fun at the time and it succeded on a very good game, Dishonored (2012), that took this concept and adapted it well .\n\nThe game has elements of stealth, survival horror and role. It also has an important political component simulating an ultra-capitalist alternative world in a city where there are no ethical dilemmas and took to end the arts , science and engineering , which led to its decline .\n\nIt is one of the top ranked games of all time . It has two sequels. The bioshock 2 showing an ultra communist character and Bioshock infinite that develops in an aerial city. In Bioshock infinite political, religious and scientific plot led to the end in a very elaborate story.\n\nThe game was released for Windows PC , PS3 and XBOX 360. The windows version required DirectX 9.0c API.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nESPAÑOL\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBioshock es un videojuego de acción en primera persona desarrollado por Irrational Games, conocida como 2K Boston/Australia en 2007.\n\nEl juego transcurre en los 60. El jugador, Jack, sobrevive a un accidente de avión y llega a la ciudad submarina Rapture que se encuentra en decadencia. Allí deberá luchar contra seres humanos mutados y capturar la sustancia ADAM de pequeñas niñas defendidas por poderosos Buzos llamados Big Daddies. Esta sustancia le perimitirá adquirir mejoras genéticas.\n\nBioshock realmente sorprendió, ya que creó un mundo totalmente nuevo con una narrativa increible. la historia es digna de destacar. Si bien los mapas no son enormes, presentan un arte superlativo y hay tantas cosas que hacer que uno nunca se aburre. El combate es frenético, hay que hackear torretas y máquinas que brindan municiones y recursos, hay recursos ocultos para buscar y los tónicos brindan una variedad notoria al combate.\n\nEn lugar de solo poseer pistolas, ametralladoras, etc, nos encontramos con tónicos de fuego, rayos eléctricos, nubes de abejas u muchas otras formas de ataque.  Este mecanismo mixto de combate fue bastante novedoso y diria que el muy buen juego Dishonored de 2012 tomó este concepto y lo adaptó muy bien.\n\nEl juego posee elementos de sigilo, survival horror y rol. Además posee un importante componente político simulando una mundo alternativo en una ciudad ultracapitalista donde no hay dilemas éticos y se llevaron al extremo las artes, la ciencia y la ingeniería, lo que llevó a su decadencia.\n\nEs uno de los juegos mejor rankeados de todos los tiempos. Posee dos secuelas. El bioshock 2 que muestra un personaje ultra comunista y el Bioshock infinite que se desarrolla en una ciudad aérea y hay componentes políticos, religiosos y científicos  llevados al extremo en una historia muy elaborada.\n\nEl juego se lanzó para PC bajo Windows, PS3 y XBOX 360. La versión de windows requería la API DirectX 9.0c","November 25, 2013","true","43.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

But then again, I'm a man who thinks that magic comes from hats, not from BS like "DNA" and I know for a fact that sea slugs aren'real.\n\nDon't believe me? Go find a slug. I'll wait. But once you do, put a little salt on it. The slug will die. Sea water, as well all know, is salty, because communists cry into rivers at night to poison the great oceans to keep us from drinking them and solving the problem of global hydration!\n\nSo, sea slugs? That's the least believable part of this game! I also got mad when the game suggested that there were no gods, which is a blatant lie, because duh, Marduk, the bull-calf of the sun-god Utu is real! OBVIOUSLY!\n\nThis game also put out one of my eyes. I still recommend it. The game, not the eye. The eye was bad. That's why this game knew to put it out. It's  a good game like that.

But a good game, nonetheless.\n\nI think that we should go back to the system where the man who fought the most bears was king, but T.

Danger lurks around each corner in Rapture, but you don't feel powerless, just in need of constant survival. I liked how the game forced you into being efficient with your ammo, and made you use each weapon for different situations. I also liked the way the plot unfolded, not with an overwhelming surge of information, but with pieces of the puzzle which made sense in the end.

The enemies are great, from the splicers to the Little Sisters and their Big Daddy defenders. But I have only one serious problem with this game. The devs did not joke around when it came to ammunition. The game claims that I need to gather Adam from the Little Sisters, but with what? Those Big Daddies are very powerful. Taking them down chews through your ammo like nothing! . Finding ammo is so difficult, often I find myself constantly dying while sniffing around for health, money and ammo. At least your enemies don't regen health when you respawn. It makes taking them down so much easier. Buying ammo from the vending machines will drain your money faster than you can say "Screw you Rapture".\n\nWhy is the wrench such a pathetic weapon? It does no damage whatsoever. Melee is important in games. I found myself dying countless times because I have no ammo for my other guns, and I only have the wrench. It does nothing, I repeat, NOTHING! (except for freezing enemies, but I'd rather use the chemical thrower for that.)\n\nAnd also, what is up with the boring, tedious hacking mechanics? Why do you have to connect pipes to get fluid to go from input to output. It's so boring and if you don't do it right, you lose most of your health.\nRegardless, a fantastic game.

A friend recommended me this game, and I wasn't sure about it. Looked iffy, but as soon as I started playing, I knew why he liked it so much.\n\nFirst of all...\n\nThe story Is completely extraordinary and you play not just to have fun but to be immersed in the disturbing story of Rapture, and what happened to it. I used to play games just to have fun, but now I really focus in on te story, and this one was extremely well written. I don't want to spoil a thing, but all I can say is the story is truely amazing.\n\nSecond...\n\nThis game came out in 2007, but the graphics were pretty kickass at the time. I think 2k really did it right with the graphics. They even look good in present day 2015, so give 2k and the Unreal Engine some credit\n\nLastly...\n\nThe Gameplay mechanics were really good. I liked how the guns handled, LOVED The plasmids and how unique each were. Aiming was not hard, which was good because the ADS Wasn't that good and I usually hipfired. The HUD was well made and looked good too, and switching weapons I could do with ease.\n\nComplaints? Well, I guess there's one. SO HARD TO FIND AMMO!! But that aside, this game is EXTREMELY FUN and I know you will enjoy every little second of getting drugged, killing little sisters, and getting mowed down by big daddy's.\n\n11/10 <-- Not even overexaggerating, I love this game.","April 16, 2015","true","12.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I will divide my reviews into three parts and a comments section to keep things standardized.  I will do my best to give candid and brief reviews.\n\nBioshock Review\n\n(Story)\nDo you have a choice?  This is the question Bioshock asks.  The game takes place in 1960, in an underwater city called Rapture.  The city is falling apart as civil war rages among its citizens.  As a nameless protagonist (who winds up in Rapture due to an accident), you meet and help numerous people as you learn more about what happened to the city leading up to the war.  There are good and evil choices to make and multiple endings to the main story that reflect your decisions.  The dialogue is well written and voice acting phenomenal.\n\n(Gameplay)\nBioshock is a first person shooter with most combat taking place in close quarters areas.  You alternate between conventional fire arms and powers called "plasmids" that allow you to shoot electricity from your hand, throw objects, etc.  The weapons  have multiple ammo types/firing modes/uses that are acquired through upgrade stations.  Likewise, plasmids can be upgraded and all feel unique.  Multiple play styles are available: go in guns balzing, set traps for enemies to walk into, hack turrets so they fight with you, or take a stealth approach.  Ammo, health, and crafting supplies are acquired from looting or use of vending machines strewn about.  One mechanic the first two Bioshock games are known for is enemy research.  In Bioshock, research is accomplished through taking photographs of enemies and filling your research bar.  Every time you reach a new level of research, you gain a damage boost against that particular enemy.  Ammo can get scarce sometimes.\n\n(Design)\nThe art-deco/1950's/1960's America decor are very well done here.  The advertisements, record player music, items, even the bottles all fit the time period. The game can get scary at times too due to the atmoshpere and noises you hear as you creep around.  Nearly every object has its own physics.  Glass bottles clink, suitcases float in the water, and fire leaves furniture (and enemies) charred.  The sound design is excellent, though I have an issue when gunfire starts where sounds cut out due to everything going on.\n\n(Final Comments)\nAs the first in the series, Bioshock is a great game with good controls, great writing, and one-of-a-kind atmosphere.  The twist of the story is legendary in my mind and the dialogue will leave an impression on you.  Now, would you kindly stop reading my review and dive into Rapture.","June 24, 2014","true","12.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Just finished playing it for the first time, and I have to say, it was amazing. It's about 6 years old, but still thrills to the bone! Rarely do you find such a smart shooter with RPG elements, climactic storytelling and great voice acting. Danger lurks around each corner in Rapture, but you don't feel powerless, just in need of constant survival. I liked how the game forced you into being efficient with your ammo, and made you use each weapon for different situations. I also liked the way the plot unfolded, not with an overwhelming surge of information, but with pieces of the puzzle which made sense in the end. I can't believe it took me so long to play Bioshock, and I can't wait to go through the sequel!

I bought it to give it a second chance. Let's take a look how good it was.\n\nVisually the game is good. The environment looks fine, but models are rather strange. Sounds are average, but the game has some nice songs playing from jukeboxes, radios etc. which fits the setting.\nGameplay is quite awkward. Even though it has some good features (hacking, plasmids), the action itself doesn't work that great. Enemies run around like idiots, which makes them difficult to hit. You never have enough ammo, but you can buy that from vending machines. Weapons can also be upgraded, though effectivity of these upgrades is sometimes questionable. Sometimes the game tends to be frustrating, but mostly it's alright. But then comes one part where you keep losing your maximum health. It happens quite often, like every five minutes. Developers probably thought it was a good idea to punish you for exploring instead of rushing towards the goal to stop this health loss. They were wrong. Thankfully, you can explore what you missed later after you find a solution for this situation, and even your health gets back to normal.\nAnd the last thing to rate - the story. Hard to say anything about it since you hardly experience it directly. In order to get information about Rapture's past events, you must collect tape recorders and they slowly, like pieces of puzzle, let you see the whole picture. It's an interesting way to tell the story. The story itself seems above average.\n\nEven though it didn't get to the list of my most favourite titles, the game as a whole isn't bad. Rapture has a very original atmosphere and the architecture along with music makes the place feel alive. This game's weakest point is the gameplay, but it still is quite fun. Let's just hope the developers learned from some of their mistakes and polished the other two Bioshock games more.","January 9, 2014","true","38.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeterMatias/recommended/7670/","PeterMatias","Peeta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeterMatias/","144 products in account","Bioshock is one of those games you can't help but to put in a category all by itself. It is not just an FPS, it is a narrative driven game where the story will take center place, and where the gameplay just seems to be the addition to that same story.\n\nI can't tell the plot without spoiling it to anyone, but I will tell you this, it is a story so good, with plot twists that will blow your mind, that at some point Universal Pictures was going to produce a movie based on it. The whole game world sucks you in, you explore an underwater city called Rapture, after your airplane crashes in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean... and literally nothing in this game, story wise, is as it seems. I was really impressed with this AAA story, and if you like games that are not just about blowing stuff up(which Bioshock also has in spades) you will be looking at your screen in awe as you reach the end of the game. The story is simply put, phenomenal.\n\nGameplay wise, Bioshock offers a lot of freedom. You have your standard weapons, like a machine gun, a grenade launcher and a Pistol, each with 3 different ammo types. This plays a key role in battle, as some ammo is more efficient in dealing with certain types of enemies. You also have access to a camera, allowing you to take pictures of your enemies to discover their weaknesses, and it is a really useful tool. On top of the weapons, you have Plasmids. Plasmids are genetically created abilities that allow you to deal even more damage to your foes. You have Winter Blast which freezes your enemies which you can then dispose of with a shotgun blast for example, Electro Bolt which deals electricity to your enemies and hostile machinery, and quite a few others. The plasmids are what makes your approach to battles more fun. You can use them in any way you see fit, and this is what truly makes the combat in this game stand out. You have near infinite possibilities to dispose of your foes, and combined with your tonics, (upgrades that allow your character to get stronger and allow certain actions in the game a lot easier) you can become a true killing machine.\n\nThe AI in the game is quite impressive as well, with enemies running away when hurt, and looking for health stations to heal. These are some of the most challenging enemies in a video game I have ever encountered, and they will keep battles fresh and exciting.\n\nThere is so much more I could say about this game, but the essential is this: Bioshock is one complete game package. The story is amazing, the gameplay is perfect and revolutionary, the music fits the action nicely, and even the graphics are really good, for a game with a few years. Bioshock is in my opinion, one of the best games ever made, and for the price you pay, you will be getting a game experience you will never forget.\n\nThe Good\n\n-Amazing Story, it will mess with your definition of morality\n-Gameplay is fine tuned to perfection\n-The Plasmids offer a freedom in combat that is uncommon in FPS/RPG hybrids\n-Combat requires a cautious approach due to the ammo types in all weapons, simply point and shoot won't get you far\n-Art style is phenomenal, the city of Rapture has a very Art Deco feel to it\n-Characters in the game you actually care about(for the better and the worse)\n\nThe Bad\n\n-Nothing I can think of, it is really close to perfection\n\n9.5/10","January 8, 2014","true","24.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kingsindiandefence/recommended/7670/","Kingsindiandefence","Kingsindiandefence","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kingsindiandefence/","10 products in account","Well... Where do I start?\nThe story starts with you, on a plane which somehow crashed into the sea and near a lighthouse.. It seems you're the only one that survives the crash and having no choice, you went inside the lighthouse and found a bathysphere.. Looks good enough, when you came down and found out that you were going to an underwater city called rapture where at first glance looks like an utopia, but hides a more sinister background.\n\nUntil here, I feel that the game follows the traditional line of FPS games. I have to admit, the graphics, music, and ambience was spot on. While those are factors that helps to improve game experience, I myself gave a higher emphasis on great story and plot rather than just aim and shoot.\n\nAs the story progresses, you will make choices such as deciding whether to (Spoiler) harvest or save the little sisters. Either one of those choices would impact the gameplay in a way and also (Spoiler) the ending as well. Nevertheless, as you progressed, you realised that what you perceived as the truth... might not be the right one after all.\n\nAfter a quite lengthy process to reach what I thought was the end, instead I was given the shock of my life (Yes, that came out of nowhere). If you paid attention, you could see it happening, but you never thought it would be the crucial factor! Then came what I think is the weaker part of the game which are close to the end.. The boss battles was suprisingly not that difficult and the ending.. Well, even though I am glad my choices are correct, for some reason I wanted more (probably I hope I would get more explanation in Bioshock 2 and Infinite).\n\nTo be honest, I've heard of bioshock but never had the chance to play it until it was on sale (3 games for 13$). But after I played it, this game basically was an eye-opener. I had played many FPS games and not one game, have such amazing combination of all the factors that made the game not just great, but also potentially I could call a cult classic.\n\nThe game also introduced the music nicely, which opened my music sense to old songs from the 40s and 50s. Just like GTA opened my ears to spanish, classical, rock, rap, hip hop, and country music, this game allows me to listen and appreciate songs that baby boomers or traditional generations listen to.\n\nAll in all, I would give this game 9.4 / 10. This was that gem, that rare find in the sea of mud where contrary to popular belief, FPS games can also have amazing storyline and plot while having (during its time) a unique combat system.\n\nThis is easily one of my top 3 games of all time (which might change as I haven't played 2 and Infinite + the dlc!)\n\n\nNow, would you kindly buy and play this game?\n\n","November 18, 2014","true","31.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

I shied away from it for a long time as I detest most shooter type games feeling that good suspense and horror is based on story and powerlessness of the main character.... But I was wrong! Not only is this game thick with well written themes, the gunplay is actually fun and doesnt wreck the rest of the game by consuming it with points, getting kills, or other such nonsense. The main character survives a plane crash only to find himself in some sort of underwater 'utopia' built by a man of science and industry. But as our main character discovers quite quickly, things have gone very wrong down in Rapture and he will be lucky to get out in one piece. Beautifully rendered using Art Deco motifs and music from the 1950s, this game is imaginative, brilliant, fun and I honestly cannot think of a single problem with it. It plays smoothly and without a glitch on my 300$ Del laptop. If you have not had the pleasure of discovering this game, do yourself a big favor and get it!

Many hours of gameplay for a single player game. Even has replay value.\n+The FPS elements are great. Using different guns and abilities to take out your enemies doesn't get stale.\n+The RPG elements aren't perfect but can really change the way you play, especially when you start upgrading.\n+ Even though through most of game the tension is high and it can be downright scary at times, it was never grotesque or resorted to jumpscares to shock you.\n+ Difficulty modes. The game might be a bit overwhelming at first but is actually rather easy when you get used to it. But being able to increase the difficulty on subsequent playthroughs solves that problem.\n+ Though the visuals might have aged somewhat, I got totally emersed in them.\n\nNOT SO GOOD\n- Controls aren't optimal and is part of the overwhelming start. Switching weapons, powers and ammo doesn't get smooth until you learn to just deal with it.\n- The Hacking minigame, like in most other games, is too boring and occurs way too frequently. Almost every camera and turret in the game needs to be either hacked or destroyed to progress. And since conserving ammo is quite a big deal, hacking is the best choice but also the most boring one.\n-Though survival and conserving your ammo are elements of the game, expect to blaze through on easier difficulties after you get used to the enemies and such. (Big Daddies are Big Babies, no really)\n- The final araes of the game take a looong time. This might be a good thing to some, but it feels stretched and a little disjointed from the rest of the game. Making the ending overall a bit weak compared to all you've done to get there.\n\nSo step right up and get yourself a ticket to Rapture, because this game is totally worth playing! Especially if you've become a fan of the Bioshock series because of it's more recent installments!","February 8, 2015","true","39.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After having replayed it and this time actual paying attention, BRAVO! This was an outstanding game. The twist got me as if it was my first time playing this game. I already knew one twist, but the main twist got me like it should have the first time. Playing this game with a mouse and keyboard is definitely the way to go. Using a controller was just too slow to aim with and trying to hit splicers was a right pain in the ♥♥♥. That being said with the mouse I was able to clean house! The boss was still just as easy as it was with a controller, but I knew going in that the boss was a bit of a let down.\n\nThe many unique things about this game is what sticks with me the most. The plasmids giving you a super power is interstingly done. It changes your DNA and you need ADAM to splice yourself up more and get more powers. The setting is one of a kind. Not many would venture to the bottom of the sea and put a giant city in the name of freedom from all forms of "Parasites." The story, if you pay attention, is fantastic. I never would have guessed the things I found out had I not played it again.\n\nEven after all these years the game still holds up and is an instant classic. Now I understand completely. For people who want to play this and are having problems with the game crashing open up properties and open launch options. From the put type in -dx9 and it shouldn't crash while you play. You will also notice that the animations and ragdolls are at 30FPS. If you go online and look for bioshock physics unlocker it will fix that for you.\n\nSo overall for this game I am rating it a 9.5/10. I would give it a perfect score, but the boss still grinds my gears of how easy he is. So take that as you will.","January 17","true","17.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Your plane crashes next to a light house and you, for some reason, enter and explore Rapture.\n\nThe game has too many bugs and crashes. If you look deep into Google enough, you'll probably solve them. But it's a little frustrating when you have to keep trying to find solution to all the crashing.\n\nThe gameplay is really plain. It's your average shooter in a singleplayer game except you have some magic called ADAM. I found that a lot of the ADAM skills and other passive skills were not needed. I really only focused on just using guns, but that's just my playthrough of it. I felt the ADAM skills were only needed to stun enemies for a second.\n\nThe real reason why I'd only recommened this game is for the story. A lot of times I was anxious and paranoid for any enemies that might be crawling around, but I also felt sad for them. I kept feeling depressed after hearing the recordings that are left behind by previous Rapture citizens, the Little Sisters, and especially Sander Cohen. Out of all the games I've played, this guy was the craziest yet funniest villains I've encountered.\n\nOverall: I have to give this 8/10\nThe whole time I've kept asking myself as the protagonist, "Why the hell am I doing all this crap?" It's not until at the end when everything is revealed, which blew my mind. But there are too many pobrlems  with the crashing, the glitchy audio, and the mouse acceleration. However; I'd recommend this game for the lore and the environment. So would you kindly play this game?\n\nAlso, I'd recommend you look wikipedia the history and story after finishing the game.","January 11","true","7.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is essentially a morality game and so it forces you to make crucial decisions of which both effect you, the outcome of the game, characters around you and most importantly the power you will possess. Everything in Rapture is destroyed with mere intentions that just go wrong, leaving a dystopian world of chaos and greed. Ever character appears to be what they are because of rapture and their involvement with it, therefore, no one is technically 'evil' just flawed on different levels.\nProbably the standout element of Bioshock is the ability to modify your genetic make-up to develop new weapons and abilities - for instance, early on you gain the ability to fire lightning bolts from your hands, which can then be used on a simple level to stun enemies, rendering them more vulnerable to a solid whack with the wrench, or on a more strategic level to electrify water and take out multiple enemies, fry electrical devices, or enrage the Big Daddies and goad them into attacking other bad guys. Later on you can adopt more macabre plasmids, like the ability to fire swarms of bees, and passive skills like the power to tap into electronic devices.\n","November 28, 2015","true","9.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kingsindiandefence/recommended/7670/","Kingsindiandefence","Kingsindiandefence","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kingsindiandefence/","10 products in account","Well... Where do I start?\nThe story starts with you, on a plane which somehow crashed into the sea and near a lighthouse.. It seems you're the only one that survives the crash and having no choice, you went inside the lighthouse and found a bathysphere.. Looks good enough, when you came down and found out that you were going to an underwater city called rapture where at first glance looks like an utopia, but hides a more sinister background.\n\nUntil here, I feel that the game follows the traditional line of FPS games. I have to admit, the graphics, music, and ambience was spot on. While those are factors that helps to improve game experience, I myself gave a higher emphasis on great story and plot rather than just aim and shoot.\n\nAs the story progresses, you will make choices such as deciding whether to (Spoiler) harvest or save the little sisters. Either one of those choices would impact the gameplay in a way and also (Spoiler) the ending as well. Nevertheless, as you progressed, you realised that what you perceived as the truth... might not be the right one after all.\n\nAfter a quite lengthy process to reach what I thought was the end, instead I was given the shock of my life (Yes, that came out of nowhere). If you paid attention, you could see it happening, but you never thought it would be the crucial factor! Then came what I think is the weaker part of the game which are close to the end.. The boss battles was suprisingly not that difficult and the ending.. Well, even though I am glad my choices are correct, for some reason I wanted more (probably I hope I would get more explanation in Bioshock 2 and Infinite).\n\nTo be honest, I've heard of bioshock but never had the chance to play it until it was on sale (3 games for 13$). But after I played it, this game basically was an eye-opener. I had played many FPS games and not one game, have such amazing combination of all the factors that made the game not just great, but also potentially I could call a cult classic.\n\nThe game also introduced the music nicely, which opened my music sense to old songs from the 40s and 50s. Just like GTA opened my ears to spanish, classical, rock, rap, hip hop, and country music, this game allows me to listen and appreciate songs that baby boomers or traditional generations listen to.\n\nAll in all, I would give this game 9.4 / 10. This was that gem, that rare find in the sea of mud where contrary to popular belief, FPS games can also have amazing storyline and plot while having (during its time) a unique combat system.\n\nThis is easily one of my top 3 games of all time (which might change as I haven't played 2 and Infinite + the dlc!)\n\n\nNow, would you kindly buy and play this game?\n\n","November 18, 2014","true","31.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

It's a masterpiece, and I will never forget the happy ending I got when the game was finished. I felt like I couldn't write a review yet until I completed the game. I was actually not going to buy this game since it is a horror game. However, I pulled myself through and I was having a hell of a time. This game is old, but the game feels like it's new.\n\nPros:\n+ Amazing graphics\n+ Multiple endings\n+ Story is compelling\n+ Have the ability to hack machines\n+ Arsenal, loads of weapons\n+ Controls are easy to use\n+ Upgrade powers and weapons\n\nCons:\n- Certain plasmids have unfair advantages\n- Crashes due to Unreal engine, sometimes\n- Big Daddies become easier to deal with later on because of weapons such as the chemical thrower. It gives unfair advantages\n- Annoying bug that changes your settings back to normal when you changed them for your desire\n\nIn Conclusion  What I put in the cons is probably mostly false since I couldn't really find any bad reason to not buy this game. The story, the arsenal of weapons and powers are what kept me coming back to this game. I can't compare this game to Bioshock 2 and Infinite because I haven't played them.

One of my favorite aspects of this game is its use of the Art Deco movement to define the architecture of the beautiful Rapture. Art Deco is one of my favorite art forms and to see it in a video game is just brilliant.

One of the Master classes of FPS, BioShock combines exciting FPS gameplay, with a tense storyline, and brutal social commentary. For years I had waited for someone to do a refutation of Atlas Shrugged by the radical nut Ayn Rand. Finally I have been given something of that caliber. One of my favorite aspects of this game is its use of the Art Deco movement to define the architecture of the beautiful Rapture. Art Deco is one of my favorite art forms and to see it in a video game is just brilliant. Ken Levine is a master storyteller who isn't afraid to get his hands dirty in the mud pool that is political commentary.

You can learn so much about the history of the world just by observing advertisements on the walls and listening to audio tapes scattered across the world. The story is so unique. The lore of this game is what's going to keep me coming back for more. There are many plot twists that will shock and amaze you. The gameplay isn't anything amazing or innovating. It's a first person shooter full of your normal: revolvers, machine guns, shotguns, grenade launhers. But the game also includes superpowers called: plasmids. These really keep the game fresh and exciting as you can do anything from emitting electrcity from your hands or using telekinisis to lift dead enemies and use them as a human shield.

But after that, it was all uphill, I started seeing the reason why I bought this game in the first place, the story picked up, it was paramount to solve the current mission and move on to the next ASAP.\n\nGameplay wise, it is decent, but what really is the heart and soul of the game is the story and the morality of your choices. I chose badly, thinking there was no other option and will always be haunted by my choices. The ending was quite emotional and a real kick in the gut.\n\n\nThe game did crash a couple of times though...\n\nThe Bioshock franchise has a knack for brilliant story-telling, and now, would you kindly buy the game and see for yourself. =)","June 24, 2015","true","14.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I just finished Bioshock 1 today, and will play 2 shortly, although I played at easiest difficulty and finished in about 6 hrs.\n\nRapture is boring for me, the game kinda gets repetitive and I can't really relate myself to the games atmosphere, everything feels alienating. 1960s tech, impossible underwater city, super genetic manipulations, and characters that are badly deformed, etc.\n\nPlaying the game seems more of a chore than an actual enjoyment to justify the $1 I spent on the humble bundle. nevertheless, I'll still play them. Looking forward to Infinite, which judging from trailers and gameplays, looked better to my tastes.\n\nAlthough honestly If it wasn't in my game library I would have just looked up at some youtube videos showing the whole story.\n\nI give the game 6/10.

The story is one of the better stories I have been lucky enough to experience in a video game (right next to goat simulator).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saleck/recommended/7670/","Saleck","Saleck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saleck/","650 products in account","I remember when BioShock was almost upon us in 2007. The spiritual successor to System Shock 2 made by the same people who made System Shock 2? I had to own this. I had read the reviews again and again, watched every trailer and ordered my collector's edition with the Big Daddy model that managed to arrive at my house undamaged and then the big day arrived. I installed it, fought with the SecuROM DRM and was immediately having sound and graphical problems because this was 2007, the time Windows Vista was making lives a misery for people around the world, drivers for sound cards were generally crap and games made for Windows Vista sometimes didn't work well with XP and vice versa.\n\nBut now it is officially the future and going back to this game on a nice beefy PC was an amazing experience, I had forgotten how good this game was and how close to System Shock 2 it was and, if you like that game then you will most certainly like this.\n\nBioShock is a First-Person Shooter with horror and stealth elements set in the year 1960. You are on a flight to an unknown destination when all of a sudden, the plane ends up crashing somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean and you are the only survivor. You make your way to a lighthouse in the distance only to find, not sanctuary and rescue from the near-death experience you just survived, but the gateway to a mysterious underwater city built by one of the most libertarian antagonists you will probably ever see in a video game.\n\nWhen you arrive, the city is in a state of chaos and decay. The majority of its residents are dead and the few that have survived have either gone insane or are just trying to survive and find a way to leave. A lack of maintenance is causing the city to slowly fall apart and flood. You will have to find some way of getting back to the world above.\n\nYou are not completely defenceless however, you soon learn of a mysterious substance called ADAM and how it can be used to alter an individuals genetic code from scratch. Plasmids are powers which you can acquire that will give you many different abilities such as the ability to set foes on fire, freeze them on the spot in ice, throw heavy things with telekinesis and even summon a swarm of killer insects!\n\nFrom the very beginning, the game does a phenomenal job of creating an amazing world for the player to explore with a really nicely done Art Deco style and presentation. The game also feels very reminiscent of the Fallout series. The music and some of the artwork you'll see will definitely make you feel a little Wasteland nostalgia deep inside.\n\nEvery game so far made by Ken Levine has had a brilliant story to it and BioShock is no different. Like System Shock 2, you'll find Accu-Vox voice recorders lying around the environments you explore that are made by the citizens of the city. They will tell most of the story and give you key information about what exactly happened to the residents in the city, how it all started to collapse and how to progress through the dangerous world ahead.\n\nThe first hour or so of the game is quite linear, guiding you around perfectly crafted set-pieces and environments to get you used to what exactly is going on, what everything is and does and who your friends and foes are. The game opens up fairly quickly with non-linear levels and the player is then free to explore any area they can get access to. The environments are nicely varied and very detailed too; you will explore many different locations along your journey such as theatres, parks, hospitals and gardens and you are free to go back to any area you have previously been to.\n\nThe game is extremely atmospheric. A large part of the game's atmosphere comes from its amazing lighting and sound score. The sombre music and orchestral stings do an amazing job of creating a unique sense of fear and tension that had not been seen any any game before it.  The water effects were also, for the time, an incredible accomplishment and something that had not been seen since Half-Life 2. Different objects have different levels of buoyancy, water leaks from the ceiling and walls, doors that are holding back water from a collapsed walkway are bulging and warping due to the pressure and it all adds up to a constant lingering reminder of where you are and what is happening to the city. The game also includes a fair amount of superbly crafted jump scares and is good with messing with your head right until the very end of the game.\n\nBioShock's game mechanics largely copy System Shock 2's albeit with a few corners cut off; the game doesn't have a deep role-playing system like System Shock 2. Shock 2 has a full RPG system with character statistics and skills and those skills were needed to determine what you were good at doing. In BioShock, you can hack any machine, use any gun and use and plasmid right from the beginning. The only thing that comes close to any sort of RPG element comes from the equippable plasmids and tonics you find and earn. You have a limited amount of slots for them which means choosing what you want to be able to use against your enemies at will require some forward thinking.\n\nBioShock also allows for the use of different ammo types in weapons, you have your standard kind of ammo that's quite plentiful but not really good or bad against any specific thing but guns can have armour-piercing rounds for tough opponents, anti-personnel rounds for dealing quickly with squishy human type enemies, proximity mines for sealing off passageways and many other kinds of things. You will need to choose the right ammo type for the right opponent in order to conserve that precious ammo.\n\nAnd now, it's time to talk about the faults, yes it has faults but they are somewhat minor. Hacking, whilst always useful, is the most bizarre and tedious mini-game that they could've made. You have to reveal tiles on a grid that conceal different sections of pipes and then re-arrange those pieces of pipes to form a system that can get a slowly progressing body of water along from its starting point to its finishing point whist avoiding security and alarm nodes which are also hidden under those tiles. It can be fun at times but after the 50th time you do it, you may find it becoming tedious. You have the option to just pay money to hack things anyway if you're feeling lazy. The game also pauses whilst you hack so if a camera is just out of reach, you can jump, hit the hack button and hack away whilst seemingly floating in mid-air!\n\nAlso, they went and added some more plasmids and tonics as downloadable content but they fell into the trap of breaking immersion by telling you in game that those new goodies are "downloaded" when you go to buy them and thinking the player wants access to them with as little effort as possible, therefore setting the price of these new goodies to just 1 ADAM each! It wouldn't have taken much effort to sensibly price them to match their original counterparts. A slightly missed opportunity to make your plasmid buying decisions a tiny bit more demanding.\n\nThe final area of the game is a pain, having to go through a tedious section with really slow pacing is probably the lowest point of the game. The boss fights for the game are, for the most part, exactly like fighting normal enemies but they just have more hit-points. The game also wants to hold your hand all the way through. It will constantly remind you to press keys to reload and press keys if you are stuck and need a hint.\n\nBioShock is an incredible game to play and I'm glad I went through it again as I was reminded just how much of a good game it was. It's an artistic and technological masterpiece that has aged really well and is a blast to play from start to finish. Just be sure to go through the options, turn off Vita (Respawn) Chambers that eliminate all challenge and play on at least Normal difficulty to have one whale of a time!","April 21, 2014","true","20.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

Audio logs which supplement the plotline can be found by exploring the environment and are a welcome addition. The game is set in the underwater city of Rapture and follows two men who struggle for power - Andrew Ryan, leader of the famous Ryan Industries and Frank Fontaine.\n+ There are quite a few weapons that can be upgraded, like crossbows, shotguns, pistols, the Tommy Gun, grenade launchers and a chemical thrower which fires liquid nitrogen, napalm and electric gel.\n+ A key part of Bioshock is the use of Plasmids, genetic abilities which can freeze enemies solid, incinerate or electrocute them. Unleash a swarm of killer insects or create a decoy target to draw fire away from you. There's many options here.\n+ To add greater complexity there are tonics which improve your skills in countless ways. Physical tonics add healing benefits and eve restoration (eve is required to cast plasmids), engineering tonics are crucial to hacking safes, door combinations, gun turrets, vending machines and cameras. Then you've got combat tonics for physical damage resistance.\n+ The characters are interesting, the shooting is great, basically it's fun which is the most important pro.\n\nMixed:\n\n~ Only about 15 hours of content for this FPS, which is not much (played on medium difficulty and didn't really have any issues). It's not the worst I've seen but clearly it's lacking in gameplay longevity.\n~ Graphics are not bad considering the age of this game. Average.\n~ Somewhat linear game. It is not open-world and there are no side missions, it's strictly one area to the next. With that said, it's forgiveable since the developers have put some sort of effort into hidden areas and locations which aren't essential.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Very poor map design, confusing to navigate and find out where to go for your next objective.\n\nOverall Score: 8/10\n\nVery much recommended!","June 9, 2015","true","16.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

The overall story might not satisfy some, but as you continue to play the game you fall in love with Rapture and why was created. The underwater city is not chained by morality and as a result you will encounter disturbing imagery that captivates you at the same time. It is a great shooter that has RPG elements, which increases the variety of gameplay options and allows you to experiment. The choice you make in regards to the storyline also provides another reason to play the game again. Even if the ending is lackluster, the tension and awe you feel throughout the game is extraordinary. Bioshock delivers an enjoyable and immersive experience that should not be forgotten or missed by any avid gamer.","December 27, 2013","true","12.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Today in gaming first person shooter just means Call of Duty Clone or something of that flavor, and it's kind of depressing most people think that.\n\nThis game you don't have infinite ammo, you have to worry about your health. The environment feels terrifying sometimes to the point where I just can't play the game, but that's cool, because I like to be scared out of a game from time to time.  Though I do wish you had more freedom around Rapture. It's just go here do this and onward.

Its one of those games which makes you question humanity and whether us as humans are men or slaves.\nThe gameplay, whilst a little clunky, is satisfying and varied, although the Telekninesis plasmid is ridiculously powerful. The atmosphere is incredible and Rapture really sucks you in as a world. The story is also fantastic, however I found the ending to be slightly lackluster.

Sure, the action is fine, but its primary focus is its story, a sci-fi mystery that manages to feel retro and futuristic at the same time, and its characters, who convey most of the story via radio transmissions and audio logs that you're constantly stumbling upon as you wander around. All of it blends together to form an interesting underwater world that sucks you in right away and won't let go until you've figured out what, exactly, is going on in the undersea city of Rapture.\nMy only disclaimer is that playing this at night is a heart attack waiting to happen.

One being the idiotic 'this disk will self destruct' one time instal that the original PC version came with, and the second being that the game was overtly pro-Communism and and anti-Libertarian. Before I get into the right/wrong for this game, let me address both the reasons for uproar. Firstly, video game companies have proven to be nothing but greedy a-holes that we enjoy licking. Born of the mentality that when you buy a game, it's not your property, it still belongs to the game company, we've been gifted with same day DLC, on disk DLC, the war on Game Stop, and still paying $60+ for digital titles. This was one of the first attempts to wrestle ownership of a game away from you and keep it firmly in 2K's hands, and you just pay for the privilege. Kinda funny for a game that seems to extol the virtues of the Communist manifesto that nothing belongs to the individual, to actually do just that! Clever marketing maybe? Anyway, as to the second bit of trouble, the game does go out of it's way to show that the Libertarian idea of free markets and minimal government involvement leads to mass suffering.... until you reach the end of the game. No spoilers, but as the game goes above and beyond in blaming the "Great Chain" for Rapture's destruction, it turns out to be nothing more than a clever plot device. So for all the sore fanny it caused, like most outrage in the media, it was started by people that didn't care enough to investigate the entire title to discover there wasn't any outrage at all. Surprise surprise.\n\nRIGHT: BioShock does one thing, and does it incredibly well. This spans for all three titles not just the first. And that one thing is: MOOD. From the second you step into Rapture you are wrapped into a mood of decay and despair so vivid you can almost smell the water damage, and follows you to the very end. BioShock singularly gives this a second helping that the other titles sadly discarded by making the characters look..... surreal. Everything has a 1940's taste and even the characters seem to be odd glassy caricature out of a pulp comic book. Like Half Life, the graphical limitations of the time add a stylized feeling that actually feed into the immersion rather than detracted from it. The second thing these games do, is mess with your emotions. This references to the "controversy" over the games political undertow, but the game rapidly changes pace making you unsure what to think or believe till the very end. Like I say with any game, all the graphics in the world can't save a game that doesn't have a good plot, and BioShock keeps you tied in knots non-stop. The mapping is set up wonderfully for PC FPS players, controls are simple though there is a bit of a learning curve with Weapon/Plasmid combo for the mouse, it will become second nature in no time. You can add on to both your plasmids and weapons, changing effects and visuals letting you customize your combat style and type of play. The voice acting is top notch, again adding to that mood and immersion, the Splicer's vocal taunts are haunting and Big Daddy whale calls will make your flesh crawl. Another incredibly well done feature is the Big Daddy itself. Every area has a certain amount of Big Daddy - Little Sister combos lurching around collecting ADAM, and it is imperative that you defeat them if you want to upgrade your plasmids. But BioShock doesn't just hand them over, oh hell no. You are going to fight and die over and over to get that ADAM, because the Big Daddy's only purpose is to mangle you quickly and without mercy. There are two types: The Bouncer who uses only physical attacks, and Rosie who carries a rivet gun and fires mines. Though toward the end of the game you get use to the combat patterns and have a big enough arsenal that the Big Daddy only becomes moderately dangerous, through the first half of the game these things are ridiculously hard and actually prove a great challenge.\n\nWRONG: Some of this I hate to even complain about considering this is a launch title for the franchise, and naturally a proving ground for certain bugs to get fixed and concepts worked out. However, I have a few bones to pick that kept me on the fence for a while. First and foremost, is enemy type. When you first run into the Splicers, they are creepy and horrible, but after the thousandth time you've blown away a male Splicer, their creepiness has long since worn off. Even the Big Daddy loses some of its intimidation by the end of the game and you realize you feel the same playing the final level of Bioshock as you do the final level of COD. It's just a target, remove it, continue on. This game is badly in need of skins for the enemies as well as attack patterns, to give it just a bit more flavor. Secondly is the hacking. Starting the game, I loved to hack things! The pipe and water flow hack was fun and challenging, but by the end of the game I was dreading it and going out of my way to find auto hacks just so I could push ahead. This could have been fixed by adding different hacks for different objects. A hack for vending machines, a hack for security bots, and a hack for vaults. There are too many plasmids that are just, for lack of better terms, worthless. They're great to look at, some have very interesting visuals, but ultimately are just not usable. You will use the Electric plasmid because of it's ability to stun Splicers, Bots, and even the Bid Daddy. You might also take Fire plasmid, but even that loses a lot of its punch toward the end of the game due to the fact that it has little to no effect on Bots, Big Daddy, and even the Splicers just seem to shrug it off. The rest are just gimmicks that work okay or not at all, but wont save you during a fight. Another thing that bothered me was at the end of the game when you dressed in the Big Daddy suit, your hands don't change to give you the feeling that you're in the suit! For a game that goes so far to set a mood, it was kind of a big 'oops' not make this one small visual correct for that scene. And lastly, screw the limited wallet. It's a moronic gimmick to force you spend cash and limit your ability to make pit stops to top off ammunition, rather than just remove that ability all together to make a supply pinch.\n\nThat aside, BioShock is a fantastic game that has aged well and has plenty of replay value with multiple endings and plenty of hidden items to keep you playing. The story alone is reason enough to grab this title, as it will have direct effect on both of the sequels, adding to their depth and understanding.","September 12, 2014","true","20.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TomSah/recommended/7670/","TomSah","TomSah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TomSah/","185 products in account","(Low playtime due to playing boxed copy)\n\nIt is no exaggeration to classify BioShock as a videogaming masterpiece.\n\nWeaving together themes of objectivism, transhumanism and political ideology, BioShock builds a coherent narrative that is engaging and thought provoking. On the surface it is a first person shooter with RPG elements, presenting a unique fusion of traditional weapon based combat with plasmid powers to take down enemies. But when the subtle thematic elements, inspiring art style and intriguing characters are taken together the result is a highly memorable exploration of human beings and being human.\n\nWhat is the role of government? What are the rights and responsibilities of the individual? What does it mean to be human?\n\nIn attempting to address these questions Andrew Ryan built an underwater city to serve as a fortress where unbridled creativity could flourish from the worlds intellectual and cultural elite. The city is called Rapture, and Andrew Ryan is its king. He envisioned an objectivist utopia whose citizens would be free to pursue self-interest, built upon free-market enterprise. He encouraged his citizens to abandon religion in favour of the will to be great. He encouraged scientists to conduct research without restrictive ethical guidelines; artists to express themselves without the fear of censorship; businesses to trade free of regulations.\n\nThe result is a society that quickly becomes fractured down class lines amidst a background of greed, corruption and an economic recession that hits when construction of the city ends. Rapture disintegrates, its citizens splitting into factions - Sophia Lamb espouses an altruistic collectivist philosophy that sets a background of discontent as she discredits Ryan in several prominent debates. Atlas leads the working class poor, bitter about the empty promises offered to them in Raptures halls. Andrew Ryan maintains the loyalties of most of Raptures wealthy and powerful elite. Civil war breaks out, made all the more horrific by the militarisation of recent 'plasmid' technologies which were initially introduced to enhance human abilities and provide novel solutions to first world problems - "Light a cigarette from your fingertips with Incinerate! A plasmid by Ryan Industries."\n\nThe player enters this world accidentally, finding the smouldering ruins of a once great city being picked over by genetically enhanced 'splicers', as well as the little sisters that gather ADAM from their bodies. This substance is used as a currency for the purchase of plasmid abilities, but the sisters are guarded by big daddies - behemoths in reinforced diving suits that wield drills and rivet guns. In order to survive the player must defeat the daddies to obtain ADAM from the sisters. In doing so they must make difficult choices and live with the consequences.\n\nThe story, characters and dialog are fantastic. Splicers inspire terror, their deformed appearences and desperate voices giving credence to their ADAM addictions. Big daddies evoke caution and a great deal of planning on how to take them down effectively while managing the resources at your disposal. Little sisters are the embodiment of childhood innocence, their bodies turned into processing factories for ADAM as they consume the essences of the perished while humming nursery rhymes. The protagonists have complex motivations, emotions and agency. Combat is fast paced, improvised, always different and rewarding.\n\nRaptures atmosphere is immersive and engrossing. Audio logs contain snippets of the lives of its citizens before and since the breakdown, highlighting the changes and practical effects that abstract ideologies have on people caught between two warring sides. Technically the game is brilliant. Excellent voice acting, atmospheric sound design, a great soundtrack from around the period, enough graphical polish to keep up appearences. The underwater setting, ambient soundstage, optimistic music, horror elements, and contrasting verbal testaments from lead characters combine well to create a truely memorable experience.\n\nOverall, BioShock is an inspiring achievement of storytelling and must be played to be believed.\n\nSide note: To get even more out of BioShock after playing it through on normal and hard difficulties, I recommend the installation of "Silvers Bioshock Mod" which is currently in its final version (Version 7.2 alpha). This amazing little mod represents hours of testing by its author (psikoticsilver) and aims to intelligently increase the difficulty, reduce the amount of loot, and in doing so make the BioShock experience require even more planning and improvisation. It consists of several config files which are extracted to the game directory and is customisable. Installation instructions can be found on its mod page at ModDB while a summarised (and additional exhaustive) list of changes is included with the mod download.\n\nSide note #2: To really get into the nitty gritty about development and the vision behind the game I highly recommend checking out the series of podcasts[www.2kgames.com] created by the publisher 2K Games that documents game production. It features many key roles - art, sound/music, gameplay design and also Ken Levine the creative director. His thoughts are always interesting to listen to and shed alot of insight onto some of the background ideas that inspired the game.","June 26, 2014","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On one hand, there is the "Cult of Shock 2" that retain a savage disdain for BioShock because of it's extremely obvious narrative and gameplay similarities to System Shock 2. On the other hand, there are gamers that reasonably acknowledge that BioShock's elements are derivitive of System Shock 2 and claim that the elements were streamlined for a newer generation. I know BioShock fans that have given copious amounts of evidence and suggestions to back this up, and I don't necessarily agree or disagree with that. That is a matter of prefrence.\n\nWhen someone takes the time to deconstruct and analyze System Shock 2, you'll find that it is a deeply and intracately woven role-playing experience where the player needed to become familliar with varying amounts of important elements to create their characters, specialize in specific statistics, and really just to experience the game once as an introduction to it all and play through a second time to experience the game properly. Many critics praised these very aspects that made System Shock 2 one of the greatest games ever created and the sales were miserable.\n\nWhen someone takes the time to deconstruct and analyze BioShock, you'll find a game that has that overall feeling of intracacy laced within the narrative with more understandable gameplay elements that were designed, in principle, to appeal to a large audience. There are elements that can be considered RPG elements and the game had the basis of it's core gameplay display itself as a suspense game in a few areas and a balls-to-the-wall action FPS in most others. The gaming community—especially the parts of it that sided with the "Cult of Shock 2"—was split and BioShock became 2K Games' most profitable franchise at that time.\n\nWhen you take a look at the bigger picture, System Shock 2 and BioShock are two completely different games in principle and two very similar games in execution. When you get down to it, the "dumbing down" of System Shock 2's qualities was enforced, not by a corporate publisher or a greedy fat man in a black suit, but by the developers' own desire to make their baby, System Shock 2, more understandable. If you take the time to search up some interviews and stuff for System Shock 2 featuring Ken Levine and Looking Glass Studios (which is now 2K Games), you can tell that System Shock 2 was their pride and joy, and it must have been devastating when it became ignored by the central PC community.\n\nTo that extent, I can understand more reasonably (and even forgive) a few of my previous issues with this title. I used to have a psychotic hatred for this game based on System Shock 2, and my previous review that I wrote for this game was an over-glorified comparison to System Shock 2. I'm not going to make the same mistake here in this rewrite, as I've come to the conclusion that to judge BioShock by System Shock 2 would be very unfair, as I think any fan of System Shock 2 would probably agree when I say that System Shock 2 is the better of the two titles.\n\nBioShock, on its own, is an okay game. I don't think it's the genre-defining work of art that the gaming industry seems to think it is, but I don't think that it's the water-logged, hollowed out corpse of SS2 that the "Cult of Shock 2" thinks it is. It does a few things right and it does a lot of things wrong, and in the very end it's up to the fans of System Shock 2 to decide whether or not they want to take BioShock as its own experience. As one of the BIGGEST fans of SS2 out there, I'm reviewing this game from that perspective.\n\nThe gameplay elements found in BioShock all consist of unorthodox forms of first-person shooting and RPG elements without numbers. This game borrows implicitly from SS2's horror elements by including a few scenes that really do peak the player's intrest, but the attempts at horror are completely futile. The game can't be called a survival game because it isn't one, and resource management is way too easy, even on difficulty settings over Normal. These sections are far and few between as most of the game plays as a balls-to-the-wall action shooter. However, these sections are mediated by fluent pace changes every so often. Whereas other games from 2007 would often have you just shooting at everything coming by, this game takes a slower, more methodical approach to let you appreciate the vibe of what you're doing and really take in the enviorment as well as the NPCs populating it. The NPCs are hopeless drug addicts; you're a killer, and you feel like one...except when you deal with Big Daddies and Little Sisters.\n\nDespite everything else wrong with the game, *BIG DADDIES ARE FRIGGING AWESOME*, and anyone who tells you otherwise hasn't played this game. The Little Sisters, on the other hand, are the *lowest* rung on the morality ladder. Essentailly, the Little Sisters are little girls that you can either choose to save or harvest for Adam. You get more Adam for harvesting them and less for saving them. If you save all of them, you get the good ending, and if you harvest just ONE of them, you get the bad ending. Without spoiling anything, they both mean absolutely nothing and you can just watch them on YouTube. Without any character development, killing or saving the Little Girls becomes based on the reward. Would you rather have less Adam or more Adam? Exactly.\n\nThe gunplay is very unsatisfying. I'm going to be a hypocrite for a few characters and say that SS2 also had unsatisfying gunplay, but you almost never used your gun because ammo was low and most of the gunplay was backed up by the horror elements of the game. Here, the weak sounding weapons and overexaggerated reactions result in gunplay that feels like a chore to sort through. There are moments when it's satisfying to take down a Big Daddy, but that's satisfaction from the challenge and not the actual gunplay.\n\nBesides shooting, BioShock includes two performance enhancing bodily modifications called "Plasmids" and "Gene Tonics". Plasmids are essentially powers you recieve from completing missions (and you can always buy them at the vending machine). Gene Tonics are the RPG Elements without numbers I was writing about earlier. They are pretty much character enhancements that set up your character to adopt certain play styles. For example, you can put together an invisibility tonic and a melee damage tonic to take on the role of a stealth assassin. For the game's other shortcomings, that's pretty cool.\n\nThe game also features hacking mini-games in the form of circuit-based puzzles. You connect a set of pipes so water can successfully travel from one end of the circuit to another. While doing this, the game pauses and you always will have the right pieces at the right time, killing tension. If they really wanted to include some much needed tension, then they could have accelerated the current of the water whenever a piece was misplaced, or they could have provided a certain amount of each directional pipe, causing some inevitable ambiguation as to where to construct a direct path. They also could have made it so there was a tangible loss with each failure. There is no tangible loss when dying. There are Vita Chambers, which are essentially respawn points that make the game much easier than it already is, and then there's just going back to the main menu if you decide to shut it off.\n\nLike I said, I don't hate BioShock, nor do I carry the attitude I once had towards it like the "Cult of Shock 2". I don't think it's a revolutionary work of art either. I think it's okay. Not terrible, but not great. It's great in some areas and abhorrent in others, and what's there good is great and what's bad is horrible.\n\n3/5 - Okay. Worth a rental or a purchase (only if the price goes down).","July 3, 2014","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are still holding up pretty well even though they are outdated and the mechanics are refreshing. The game takes place in the under water city Rapture, a "underwater paradise" gone horribly wrong. The game is scary and makes me fell stressed out at times, but when you accomplinse something difficult, it makes you feel proud of yourself. Ive always been a fan of games that doecent teach me everything and allow me to discover things by myself. The shooting mechanics are basic and keeps it simple, like shooting someone in the head deals extra damage and so on. Diffrent types of ammonation are effective against diffrent types of enemys and allows room for experementing. The plasmids and upgrades you recive, or buy, during the course of the game allow diffrent play styles and leaves room for more playthroughs. Will you play the sneaky way or the gun happy playstyle? who knows? The game has plotwists that will leave you klinching your toes in shock and will either make you hate or love the characters that commit them.\nHowever the game isent perfect. Although the game has little to no backtracking, there will be multipel times where you are forced to search large areas to find specific items, or kill certain targets. Worst of all is when the game decideds to LOCK YOU IN a small area that you cant leave, becuse of respawning enemys and limited money and ammo pickups, you will find yourself helpless, out of health, out of "mana" , no ammo and no idea what to do. There is almost always an compass in your hud whitch shows where you should be heading next, but when arrow is gone, easy tasks will become difficult tasks. This game also contains one of the most iconic videogame characters, the big daddy, an incredible strong "mini boss" witch you face multiple times throughout the game. He has a bunch of hp and hes aggresive as f*ck. But killing him is nessesary, as he holds the key to upgrading yourself. Somtimes he appears when you dont want him to, useully when you're out of ammo or hp, or both.\n\nOverall bioshock is a game every gamer should try at one point. The game always has something new up its sleve to keep the gameplay refreshing. The locations and people are charming and sometimes funny. The enemy rank goes from patheticly easy to ♥♥♥ whooping hard. A horror like masterpeice in a pretty location, Bioshock is what games of today dreams of being. Love it.\n\n9/10 would scream like a ♥♥♥♥♥ when big daddy's charge at me again.","July 21, 2014","true","28.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And tonight, I finally finished it. If you simply want a thumbs up or down - it's a big thumbs up!\n\nStarting off in that plane, crashing to Rapture and going inside...man...what a feeling. And the messed up things you find inside... The Splicers, plasmids, Ryan, Fontaine, Atlus, etc. etc. It's all so well written and brought to life through the ageing Unreal Engine 2.5.\nSome of the hacking really does provide nice little detours on the way, e.g. hacking cameras to spot enemies instead of yourself. Or hacking machines to give you cheaper items. And there's plenty to hack along the way! Nice little touches that make for a richer experience.\n\nThe downers? Well, I played without seeking a solution to the mouse acceleration and that made some things difficult. Apparently there is a fix, so, if you're gonna play this game, get that fix! Other than that, there's little I could possibly pick up on. It all works so well that it's hard for me to find a real flaw. Maybe the EAX audio stuff is a teeny bit broken at this point! lol Honestly, that's all I've got.\n\nOverall, I gotta say, I've been a fool to avoid this game for so long. The journey your character takes, along with finding out the history of Rapture, is brilliantly done. And at the end, I walked away happy with my choices and the overall outcome (There are three endings). It may be a fairly old game now, but, damn...it plays better than a lot of stuff released today.

The characters have amazing and well thought out backstories, the story of the game itself is compelling and will constantly twist, without it feeling overused. I don't often like to play a games campaign more than once, but this is definitely an exception. After completing the game once it gives you a completely different viewpoint the next playthrough.\nNext, the weapons. None are particularly overpowered, and everyone I know who plays has a different favourite gun. They all suit different playstyles in different ways incredibly effectively.\nFinally, the enemies. Loads of people think Big Daddies are invincible, or that the splicers would be too easy. Yet no, the game is perfectly balanced, Big Daddies can easily be beaten with a little thinking and Splicers are tweaked just enough to make them a slight challenge in large numbers.\nOverall, this game is probably my favourite of all time, just buy it. There isnt a 96 metascore for nothing! I also highly reccomend the other 2 aswell.","June 21, 2014","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has aged well and continues to be just as powerful as it was when released.  I envy the first-time player, as the plot twists will still amaze you, but even the repeat player can quickly find themselves lost in the incredible atmosphere of this game.  Mechanically, it is an above-average FPS that not only provides multiple options for how to handle situations, but each of those options is actually perfectly viable.  The opponents are interesting and Big Daddies still make me dirty my pants.  The last hour of the game is less than perfect, but even that is still better than most other games out there.

It may be a few years old, but I couldn't tell from the graphics, which were still stellar. The story is extremely well done and engaging throughout- you will be searching for every voxophone and going down every side corridor to learn more.\n\nGameplay was also very fun- I played on Normal difficulty, which was challenging enough that I was never bored, while not being hard enough that I was frustrated. There weren't too many weapons to choose from (and to be honest some just didn't seem that effective compared to the standard Wrench) but I never found myself bored or distracted by that fact. Same with the Plasmids (basically, magic spells)- I almost always used the standard Electric Shock, but the others were still interesting and the gameplay forced you to use some of the other Plasmids in order to unlock secret areas or find hidden voxophones which advanced the story.\n\nIn sum, I would give this game an 8/10, with a recommendation for people who want an engaging story to go with their gameplay.","June 27, 2014","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Bioshock is an example of a game that does not get repetitive in story. The setting itself is quite original from most shooters to start with. This game also gives you a diverse range of ways to kill opponents and a lot of back story, which is not common for most videogames. The fighting is fairly simple, with a flair for dramatic deaths and a way to make quick allies. The fighting is very satisfying and new players can catch on quickly. The story is so well written and dialouged with excellent voice actors that you are drawn into it. The silent protagonist makes you sympathize with his situation from the very start. The plot twist could not have also been better delivered. The Plasmids also make fighting enemies an extremely creative process, I dare say an art form. No two people may choose the exact same plasmids as another person, making this game very fluid in its ability to offer many ways to combat enemies in the game, not just limited to run and gun. Stealth is also an important component in this game when you are low on ammo or are surrounded by numerous enemies and big daddies, often outting you at a disadvantage. The layout of the levels are also very condusive to the atmosphere and the the music score was flawless. The last thing is that though this game may not be known as a horror title, it definitly has its moments that frighten you. This game is so well made that I would dare recomend it even to people who only like playing sports games. This game whould be labled in my opinion the best well rounded, because of all its attributes and pluses. I can't even really think of anything bad or negative to say, though then again, I never really say anything bad because I always look for what is best in a game. This game has my full confidence. If you are planning to buy, you should have full confidence that this game will give you the best time for your money. ever.","May 13, 2014","true","78.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The worst of humanity: selfishness, vanity, pride; met the best: ingenuity, passion, perseverance.

It had been out for a few months by this point and incredibly i had heard nothing of the game other than a vague report from a friend it might be alright (months before it's release). The events of those first thirty minutes (trying not to give anything away here) quite literally had me sitting on the edge of my seat mouth open wide. It wasn't just the story, it was the immersion effect it had on me. Had a console version back then and played it through a few times.\n\nNow owing a pc version i decided to have another wander through Rapture. Boy am i glad i did! Lots of things i remembered, plenty i forgot. But what really had me was how well it has stood up to the test of time. I just plain enjoy everything about this game. Graphics and animations are beautiful with creative level design coupled with dynamic lighting that really gives the sensation of being on the bottom of the ocean, even if it is a little dated. Yes there is a bit of backward and forward grinding to be done mission wise, but the story/tapes you uncover along the way i feel are worth it and help the overall story. All in all Bioshock is a classic and a fantastic 25-35 hour adventure.\n\nMy Specs:\ni7 4770\n16GB Ram\nGTX770 OC (4GB VRAM)\n\nThanks for reading! :)","June 2, 2014","true","21.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Steam should really have a notice stating exactly where players can get the information to get the game up and running. However in the end I got it running.\n\nProbably my 4th-5th play through, I knew the story, I knew what was going to happen, and yet I was still immersed in the world of Rapture, I found out more and found new areas, and I was still terrified moving around the environments as the lighting, shadowing and sound really add to the tension of being alone in an underwater city.\n\nProbably one of the best games of all time. Story is amazing like the rest of the series, gameplay/gunplay is meh, but has some pretty neat mechanics. Enemies constantly refill areas when revisiting which can be annoying, time consuming and a waste of ammo. Big daddies are great mini-boses but it can be annoying when you die half way through a battle as the little sister may have gone back home meaning the whole fight was pointless.\n\nI would kindly ask anyone who doesn't just play FPS games for multiplayer and scoring headshots against nazi zombies to buy the game.","March 24, 2015","true","18.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The twist is the same, the characters are the same, the mechanics are the same (but simplified). Just felt like pointing that out... ON TO THE REVIEW!\n\n+The graphics look good to this day, with great water effects.\n+Amazing voice acting (the villain, as in the villain in the last quarter, is kind of over the top, but I think that that was intentional)\n+Good golden oldies soundtrack\n+Fun gunplay (mostly)\n+The plasmids/Psi powers/Vigors add a really fun dynamic to gunplay (even if half of them are useless)\n+The Art Deco designs are awesome.\n+Rapture is just a really cool setting.\n+Incredibly well written (you gotta love Andrew Ryan's rants, especially the ones nearer to his end. "A man chooses...")\n+Great commentary on the nature of gaming narratives that I won't spoil.\n\n-The final act of the game is just so awful. I feel like the game would have been twice as good if they had just ended with the twist reveal.\n-The Tommygun is so boring to use. This is a huge minus as it is the weapon with probably the most common ammo.\n-Speaking of which, the survival horor elements just feel token. At the beginning it is effective, but by the end, the lack of ammo just makes the game tedium. It is difficult to feel any sort of tension when there is no consequence to death (until the finale).\n-The final level of the game is an escort mission. A buggy escort mission. Enough said.\n-The final boss is awful. The developers (in an attempt to add tension presumably) made it so that you cannot save or respawn while fighting the boss. If you die, you are thrown into the main menu. The boss has three forms. All of them will kill you in two hits. This is not how you raise the stakes.\n-Both of the endings (this being an early 360/PS3 generation game has a pointless and simple morality system) are awful and abrupt. You are either a saint or the devil (despite the fact that the game actually tells you that the "EVIL" choice is good... but whatever).","March 26, 2015","true","14.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I can and have listened to it while doing work or studying, it is that good. Not only is it awesome without the game, but when added to the game it increases the atmosphere ten-fold. Gameplay is fluid and very entertaining, with very awesome boss fights. Most people did not like the puzzle feature, but honestly I didn'd mind it. Yes, it did get very repititive, but it never took away from the experience overall. The graphics are fantastic, and the artsyle was fantastic and well backed up by the music which matches perfectly. Story is absolutely fantastic. It is interesting and complex, and contains messages and themes that make the game thought-provoking and insightful. Plasmids have a large variety and make the game a lot of fun. You can rarely shoot bees out of your hands to aid you in battle in many other games. As i spoke about before the atmosphere is created by the artstyle, story and soundtrack, which makes you feel amazing while playing.

It has resulted in me taking day long breaks because I HATE repeating myself in a game when I know I did it well and because of some technical goof or failure of the game design I am set back an hour's worth of game play, which, since I am very very thorough in looking for ♥♥♥♥, is A LOT.\n\n2. I got stuck a few times in the walls, or a stupid Splicer got all up in my grill and I was literally stuck between them and a wall until I killed them. Yeah I just want to get the ♥♥♥♥ out of dodge.\n\n3. The jump sucks. Probably on the same tier of bad as the early Spyro games on the PS2. You know the ones I'm talking about.\n\n4. My abilities got switched up by the time I had to fight Fontaine, and that really messed me up because I don't explicitly remember mixing them up in the first place. Hmmm.\n\n5. The loading times are ridiculously long, like 2 minutes long. What the hell do you have to load? Is it because I'm playing on a laptop? Is it because this game isn't brand-spanking new? Why the hell do I need a Save screen for a Quick Save? Just save it as I'm playing, PLEASE. The wait makes me hesitant to save at all because I'd rather be you know, playing than waiting for it to save and hoping that after killing this one enemy and entering this room or tunnel I'll get a very rare auto save, but noooo...\n\nNow the GOOD THINGS:\n\nIt has dark themes, which I can get behind, though I feel like it's not telling everything, not revealing everything and I honestly can't put that in a good or bad category. The decay of what was supposed to be--what I can assume--an Anarcho-Capitalist Utopia is kind of unnerving and still morbidly fascinating. All the dead bodies lying everywhere, the Crazies aka the Splicers jumping, swinging, running, blasting everywhere, the Little Sisters and Big Daddies popping up every once in awhile, and the tape recorders that fill in the behind-the-scenes that aren't shown or even introduced otherwise.\n\nThis game is fun but the aforementioned problems really prevent me from giving this a 5/5 , if I were to rate it, that is. I'd give it a 3.5/5 because having to restart a long section TWICE is not fun at all, especially when it's not my fault. Lot of back and forth, back and forth, as well, and way too much ♥♥♥♥ to go through if you're as thorough as I am. I know, whiny gamer problems, but that's how I feel (shrug)","July 27, 2014","true","26.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Someone said the style is 1960's and you are a few decades off buddy. Learn your decades. Anyway the game is liken to the original Half-life except you can shoot things out of your left hand and you gain abilities in some unique ways. You gain advantages by photographing baddies, cameras and turrets ect. That is neato. It is like leveling up but in an interactive way. Great addition to the survival FPS genera. Maybe beaten it 3-4 times and playing it again.

The characters have amazing and well thought out backstories, the story of the game itself is compelling and will constantly twist, without it feeling overused. I don't often like to play a games campaign more than once, but this is definitely an exception. After completing the game once it gives you a completely different viewpoint the next playthrough.\nNext, the weapons. None are particularly overpowered, and everyone I know who plays has a different favourite gun. They all suit different playstyles in different ways incredibly effectively.\nFinally, the enemies. Loads of people think Big Daddies are invincible, or that the splicers would be too easy. Yet no, the game is perfectly balanced, Big Daddies can easily be beaten with a little thinking and Splicers are tweaked just enough to make them a slight challenge in large numbers.\nOverall, this game is probably my favourite of all time, just buy it. There isnt a 96 metascore for nothing! I also highly reccomend the other 2 aswell.","June 21, 2014","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everything about it - everything - is brilliant. Rapture is magnificent, one of the great settings ever devised in gaming. It is a glorioius masterpiece gone mad, turning into one of the creepiest gaming experiences I've ever played.\n\nThe combat is fantastic. The sheer variety of styles available to you is simply staggering. 8 different guns, 8 different plasmids, hacked turrets, hacked security drones...it's amazing how many choices you have in the way you fight.\n\nOf course, the real selling point is the story. It is a philosophical masterpiece with a stunning twist in the middle that practically knocked me off of my feet. The depth and complexity involved is incredible. There's a ludicrous amount of content available for you to find, whether it's through in-game dialogue, audio logs, incidental dialogue from splicers, or simple exploration of the rooms.\n\nThe only disappointing part of the game is the boss battle at the end of it, which is disappointingly generic and easy. But it's a minor quibble when put up against the mastery that makes up the rest of the game.

I only say on sale because while all of those things are true, it lacks a certain amount of replayability. You could go through it twice, maybe three or four times, and each time beat it in roughly fifteen hours, but the choices don't change up much.

Only when the fantastic Infinite came out was my curiosity once-again piqued and I decided to go for the Bioshock/2 Steam sale and experience for myself the artistic masterpiece in the haunting dystopia of Rapture. However, my experiences were slightly underwhelming, and only then did I realize the game - while changing the face of videogaming's artistic merit - has indeed aged, and not for the better.\n\nTo be fair, I went in knowing all the twists and turns that in 2007 rocked gamers everywhere. I knew Rapure, I knew the massive Shaymalan-esque twists, and I knew the shoe-horned morality system and derogatory "good and bad" endings. And that really did cripple my experience; since Bioshock's main selling factor was the general surprise of it all, seven years later the "gotcha" moments have dwindled into insignificance. That isn't to say there weren't unexpected beautiful and haunting moments: one of my personally favorite videogame moments ever was murdering the first Big Daddy to the backdrop of Billie Holiday's "God Bless the Child" soliloquizing the background, it created an aura of innocence that only punctuated my immoral actions, and was all the more powerful because of it. Speaking of which, and expectantly by now, the soundrack is probably one of videogaming's best - from the beautiful vocals of Holiday to the soothing strings of Django Reinhardt to the chilling "I am Rapture, Rapture is Me" score, my journey was never a bland one, almost atmospheric enough to distract me from the archaic and outdated gaming mechanics.\n\nYes, this game is first and foremost a first-person shooter, and here it fails most signicifantly. From the frustration of having to switch between my guns and my plasmids (which 2 and Infinite later fixed), to the ease of revitalizing myself with little penalty, to the unacceptable lack of aiming down the sights. Even by 2007 these mechanics were outdated, and while they were largely distracted by the overall atmosphere, as a gamer seven years later I can't help but be frustrated and underwhelmed. We now also have to deal with the generic "fetch quests," and the tired trope of meeting a potentially interesting person, having to collect and deliver X-amounts of items to them, then just having them poetically offed or - shocker - turning on you. This does does drag on a bit, then you enter the game's fantastic climax, and then you're back on the same boring track until you get to the infamous and bland final boss.\n\nAs a gamer, never will I ever discredit Bioshock as a forefather of its time and one that has elevated games to a level of esteem that without Ken Levine we simply wouldn't have. But also as a gamer, I cannot look past its glaring flaws in mechanics that other titles such as Deus Ex and System Shock 2 already overcame (and at least a decade earlier). As a retrospective gamer in modern times I see Bioshock as a title that has aged poorly, especially for a first-person genre that even now has hit a creative roadblock. In my opinion, Infinite is a far superior title that has successfully married gameplay with presentation. But if you look at Bioshock as an experience, not a game, with beautiful moments and one of gamings greatest settings, then yes, it is the esteemed and magnificent title we all know and love.","March 31, 2014","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The screen seems stretched regardless of FOV/Resolution setting. And the mouse aim is just... off. I can't tell if it's an acceleration issue or something else, but it's impossible to aim here. The controls generally are pretty ♥♥♥♥ poor, and there's a lot of graphical issue, notably particle effects cause some heavy hitting FPS despite the game looking old. The game its self is highly overrated. There are two different enemies in the game, big daddy's and your run of the mill human enemies. Kind of a letdown considering how creative the setting is. The actual weapons are okay but they feel really clumsy, if it weren't for the health bar I wouldn't be able to tell I was doing any damage.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravingmonk/recommended/7670/","ravingmonk","MONTY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravingmonk/","68 products in account","Like its predecessor, 'System Shock 2', 'Bioshock' is not a fluid experience. Whilst 'System Shock 2' is infamous for being an unforgiving and disorientatingly deep game, 'Bioshock' becomes too easy. It is possible to completely break the combat with the right combination of plasmids, tonics, and weapon upgrades (which are far too abundant). The game attempts to merge the 'Half-Life' shooting system with the roleplaying elements of 'System Shock 2' and sadly both styles do not mix. The 'Half-Life' model is intended to be balanced and dynamic, whilst adding customisation to this ruins that balance and narrows the players choice.\n\nThe 'moral choice' system remains pointless, since rescuing Little Sisters gives you plenty of Adam already. There is no need or reason to harvest them unless you get some sick pleasure out of seeing little children being evicerated - in which case, you deserve the awful ending you get for following that path. Not that the other ending is much better. In fact, the last section of the game is awful.\n\nWhich is a shame because whilst the gameplay is flawed, the story and enviroment are strong enough to warrant a reccomendation. The beautifully rendered enviroment tells a story in itself, and the audio logs add a welcome 'second layer' to the narrative. Just like its follow-up, 'Biosock Infinite', the best parts of the game are usually spent roaming the enviroment absorbing it all. The opening sequence may be one of the best in gaming (play the demo if you think I'm exaggerating) - which makes it all the more infuriating that the ending is such an ill-fitting anti-climax.","April 30, 2014","true","34.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My friend set me up for it, at first I wasn't really interested in buying it, but after he urged me to get it, I decided to give the first one a shot.\n\nNow I'm personally not a big fan of any scary stuff so the first hour of the game scared the crap out of me (I know, I know...). But after playing for maybe 1 and a half hours tops I was completely hooked. I would think about the game while going to bed. The story is just plain brilliant and how the story is based on and revolves around several ideals, it's just fantastically done.\n\nWhat I really loved about the game is that it's different from other shooters. In mainstream shooters you get guns and you shoot the ♥♥♥♥ out of the other guy and if you die you respawn with full ammo. In this game you have to be careful with everything you get because it's really easy to run out of money, which means no ammo. You constantly have to keep yourself stocked. Now of course you can find ammo lying around, but in all fairness it's really easy to run out of ammo and money if you're not paying attention to it.\n\nI'm a sucker for upgrading things, so the upgrading feature of the game was probably what I loved the most. Not only can you upgrade your guns, but also your abilities. Man don't get me even started on those! They way they set it up so you can play it in your own style of prefrences is just fantastic. However I was a little concerned with how difficult it is sometimes to change stuff around to have the abilities to your own liking.\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game to everyone who's a fan of shooters or just creepy stuff in general. I know it's not really catigorized as "scary", but man, it scared the crap out of me sometimes. After playing through it, I didn't hesitate to get number 2 and I also plan on getting Infinite when it goes on sale.\n\n8/10","December 25, 2013","true","11.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It took me 29 hours to beat it on hard, first try, 100% completion. If you're not as... thorough... as I am, then you ought to be able to beat it in 15-20 hours or so.\nI'd rate it pretty highly.\n\nBioShock puts you in the shoes of a survivor of a mid-ocean plane crash. With no where else to go, you swim to a nearby lighthouse but... why is it there?\n\nThe game was designed for consoles so this is a PC-port. If you use a controller, you'll be in good hands. If you prefer the mouse and keyboard, then you'll probably want to fiddle with the .ini files in order to "fix" the mouse control. To do this, run the game once, and close it. Now, navigate to your documents folder and find the "AppData" folder. It is hidden so make sure you are showing hidden files in Windows. You're looking for the folder: [username]\AppData\Roaming\Bioshock\nIn there, you'll find a user.ini and a bioshock.ini file.\nIn the user.ini file find/add the following lines: (you can change the MouseAccelThreshold to 1.0 if you'd like some acceleration)\nMouseSmoothingMode=0\nMouseAccelThreshold=0.0\n\nIn the bioshock.ini file find/add the following lines: (they appear twice each, so make sure to set both to false)\nCaptureMouse=False\nReduceMouseLag=False\nDoubleBufferMouseLag=False\n\nIf the game ever crashes on you (which it will if you alt-tab or if you use the Steam overlay too many times), then these two files will be overwritten with a default file (bye bye custom controls =/ )\nTo circumvent this, make a copy of these two files after you set up your graphics/sound/control options. If the game crashes, relaunch it, close it, and copy your backup files over the existing user.ini and bioshock.ini files to quickly restore your settings.\n\nAnyways, once your mouse settings are good to go the gameplay is great, and the story is engaging. If you haven't played this game yet then you're missing out. Have fun!","February 8, 2014","true","28.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I found the world of Rapture to be really creepy and the monsters that I fought as well.  I thought the weapons selection was good and the add ons and upgrades really added spice to them.  I did find myself wanting to get to the end of the game about half way through.  Having to complete tasks in order to advance was just annoying and cumbersome.  When I finally did reach the last boss, he was so easy to beat.  I got all my weapons and ammunition loaded up and ready for the final battle.  The last boss was far easier than most of the monsters I fought throughout the game.  Overall, great game, really creepy, great weapons and decent story.

It seemed like it would be the perfect game for me...\nThe storyline, i must say is truly wonderful, an innovative idea that's extremely well thought out and executed. This is accompanied by the also stunning visuals and environment style which are perfect for achieving the grungy, dystopian and eerie style that’s so synonymous with the series.\n\nUnfortunately, this did not make me impressed enough with the game enough to actually fall in love with it, or even like it slightly more than the average RPG.\nThe gameplay style is very original, making it more of a ‘real life gun holding simulator’ than an FPS. This was highly annoying at times unfortunately.  Although this style has it’s charms, its slightly more irritating than ‘fun’.  Plasmids are pretty damn awesome but after using them on your 5000th bot, they get very boring.\nWhich brings me on to my next point… It’s so damn repetitive. With the occasional plot point being the only thing that’s keeping you going, you battle through hordes of splicers again and again… and again…\n\nBasically, the longer you play, the more bored you get. With one or two twists in the story line that re-activate your interest in the game occasionally, I can say… I was vey disappointed in the game.\n\nIt’s a beautifully made, artistic… boring game.

It has one of the greatest feelings for an adventure game! The feeling of excitement.\n\nEven though the whole creepy factor is a bit lackluster, it's a really great game.\nProbably the reason why that they made two more games for it.\n\nThe whole switching between the weapons and Plasmids (It's like magic but though gene splicing. I think I may now be part electric eel, volcano, blizzard, insect, etc. without losing my face.) is a tad awkward. Seems number keys for guns and Function keys for Plasmids wasn't enough. They learned their lesson later.\n\nThough one thing I really appreciate is how they explain the whole situation through recordings you find in the depths of that underwater hellhole Rapture.

The graphics are still holding up pretty well even though they are outdated and the mechanics are refreshing. The game takes place in the under water city Rapture, a "underwater paradise" gone horribly wrong. The game is scary and makes me fell stressed out at times, but when you accomplinse something difficult, it makes you feel proud of yourself. Ive always been a fan of games that doecent teach me everything and allow me to discover things by myself. The shooting mechanics are basic and keeps it simple, like shooting someone in the head deals extra damage and so on. Diffrent types of ammonation are effective against diffrent types of enemys and allows room for experementing. The plasmids and upgrades you recive, or buy, during the course of the game allow diffrent play styles and leaves room for more playthroughs. Will you play the sneaky way or the gun happy playstyle? who knows? The game has plotwists that will leave you klinching your toes in shock and will either make you hate or love the characters that commit them.\nHowever the game isent perfect. Although the game has little to no backtracking, there will be multipel times where you are forced to search large areas to find specific items, or kill certain targets. Worst of all is when the game decideds to LOCK YOU IN a small area that you cant leave, becuse of respawning enemys and limited money and ammo pickups, you will find yourself helpless, out of health, out of "mana" , no ammo and no idea what to do. There is almost always an compass in your hud whitch shows where you should be heading next, but when arrow is gone, easy tasks will become difficult tasks. This game also contains one of the most iconic videogame characters, the big daddy, an incredible strong "mini boss" witch you face multiple times throughout the game. He has a bunch of hp and hes aggresive as f*ck. But killing him is nessesary, as he holds the key to upgrading yourself. Somtimes he appears when you dont want him to, useully when you're out of ammo or hp, or both.\n\nOverall bioshock is a game every gamer should try at one point. The game always has something new up its sleve to keep the gameplay refreshing. The locations and people are charming and sometimes funny. The enemy rank goes from patheticly easy to ♥♥♥ whooping hard. A horror like masterpeice in a pretty location, Bioshock is what games of today dreams of being. Love it.\n\n9/10 would scream like a ♥♥♥♥♥ when big daddy's charge at me again.","July 21, 2014","true","28.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Plasmids are just "there" I never had a reason to use them except of course For Fun, Hacking or Quoting Nicholous Cage (all of which worth it in my eyes, especially the last one) Outsid of that I pretty much felt there was no real use for them, No enemies weak to a certain Plasmid no Deus Ex style of using a Plasmid to get through a place. As for the Passive Plasmids again there was no real point in some of them, the only ones I generally wanted more of was the Hacking ones because as the game went on Hacking got so hard to the point where it was literly impossible to hack without a few hacking plasmids.\n\nSo lets move onto the Hacking...Honestly it stars fun but it gets boring, like REALLY boring This was basically how my Hacking excitement went\n\n*Start of game*\nSweet! i can hack these Buzzers and turrets to fight for me!\n*1/4 through the game*\nWell Lemmi hack this Vending Machine, Cause why not?\n*1/2 Through the game*\nurgh.....Boring\n*After the 1/2 point*\nScrew this, Autohacking tool!\n\nIt just becomes so very dull that I was using my huge amounts of cash (Again because the game is too easy so i always had alot of cash) on Autohacking tools, and on the final chapter I just stopped Hacking the vending machines all together because it was so very very dull\n\nFinally the Story *AGAIN, SPOILERS*\n\n\nHonestly its a little bit all over the place but in a good way and ends mostly with closure, ok well except one, why the hell did your plane crash? but I digress the game does a good job at pacing the story up to the big Shyamalan style twist and makes Atlus a very beliveable friend which is all the more suprising at the end, Atlas as a character is a rather well developed character...untill near the end when he becomes Fontanie, he then spends the rest of the game mocking you from your com system and to degrade him even worse during the last hour I kid you not about an hour before you face him he suddenly becomes a spliced up looney, Personally that was weak because all it didn't feel like I was faceing the guy who set me up, i just felt like I was facing another Splicer Alibet a newer one, I would of liked a good ol fasion Gun duel and before you beat him he THEN pulls out a new plasmid he made to turn him into what he is to try and get the edge.\n\nOverall Bioshock is a well made game and has alot of atmosphere, gunplay, and likeable characters, the things I don't like about it though is how the main villian becomes a Splicer loony like the rest of Rapture, The hacking gets VERY boring and because you can only game over at the final boss its very VERY easy","June 11, 2014","true","14.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/legendcookie/recommended/7670/","legendcookie","swagguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/legendcookie/","36 products in account","This isn't your ordinary CoD or BF, this is an adventure. Explore the underwater city of Rapture, a once beautiful landscape. Use a variety of special powers called plasmids. This game has it all.\n--- Pros ---\ninteresting/fun gameplay\ngreat graphics\ngreat plot\n\n--- Cons ---\nFew bugs/glitches\nminor sound concern\nCompared to present games (2014) might not be the best (this game was released in 2007).\n\n---Gameplay---\nBioshock allows you many ways to kill: plasmids, weapons, or both. As you progress in the game, you decide if you want to play stealthy (avoid cameras and turrets, secretly walk past enemies) or just go full berserk and kill whatever you fine. The game also has a variety of fun plasmids that let you choose your own way of killing, protection, or just some fun. The weapons, dang.The the game doesn't have like the same ammount of weapons as borderlands, quite a few actually, but they all have a different style and heck, you might prefer burning people, or just beating them up with a wrench, or maybe the classive "inserting bullets" with the submachine gun. You might hit a few glitches here and there, but hey, not everything can be perfect right?\n\nThe whole game revolves around completing missions one by one in an order til you get to the end.There are some fun missions like escort, or taking some pictures, but lots of them are just collect items/get to a checkpoint,  then rinse and repeat. You actually won't get bored since the plot is very interesting but this is a 1 way game. No different missions because of your choices or anything like that. So don't expect freedom such as free-roam... because well... your trapped in an underwater city full of physcos.\n\n\n---Plot---\nThis is what I think keeps the game going. Like mention earlier, you play as Jack, who survived a plane crash but soon trapped in an underwater city of Rapture. Most of the civilians turned crazy because of the use of plasmids, they are called splicers. You meet a friend name Atlas, who guides you through to escape. Along the way, you will meet interesting characters, allies or foes. In the game, there lies a plot twist. It's actually a big deal, not only does it get you thinking, it also affects your gameplay in an interesting... but annoying way. If you're looking for a good story, this is it.\n\nThe plot can be very confusing and hard to pick up until about the early-middle of the game or unless you are willingly happy to search around for diaries where you can pick up more info. But just hang it there, your about to be in for a heck of a ride.\n\n---Graphics, sounds, and that other stuff---\nGraphics are AMAZING especially for a game released about ~7 years ago, it'll problaby be on par with the games in 2011-2012, which is darn good for a game released in 2007. The sounds were great, blah blah blah. One big concern was that during radio messages (how you pick up your new missions, etc) and diaries (extra info that can be obtained) which is voiced btw, can be VERY hard to hear with the background noises, footsteps, water movement, gunshots, just VERY hard to hear unless you turn dat volume up so high, even the ceiling can't hold it, then yeah. If this is a concern for you, fear not, just re-read the message in your journal instead of listening to it. This game was surprising playable on a very crappy laptop I used on it, but I had to turn graphics to the lowest, which wasn't really that bad.\n\nThe game is not really the happiest, bright, sunshine-girl type game. There might be some blood.. gore... or someone being drilled... but eh.... you get used to it. You also might get in some jumpscares that'll get you spamming the guns to kill it... I won't tell you what they are.\n\n\n---VERDICT---\nSo obliviously this game isn't the BEST game in the market right now, I mean if you want, just go play Bioshock Infinitie. But ifi you want the classic, original story, just go with this. You'll have an interestingly fun gameplay while you progress through the story exploring rapture. There are some glitches, and if you happen to dislike the plot in anyway, you might have trouble sticking through the whole game. But that problably won't happen. Yes this game was a great game compared to when it was released, 2007. Now in 2014, there are other, greater, games that problably might even beat this game in everyway. But if you could imagine what games were like in 2007, you'll be surprised by this game.\n\n\n","January 6, 2014","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The details are amazing and the graphic as well.\n\nCons: Well, at my opinion, tha playability is not the big thing, to be honest. I am saying it for a simple reason that Bioshock is a FPS only because to have an "excuse" to make it a game. What makes Bioshock awesome is the well worked story but talking about the playability is very generic.\n\nthe I had much fun playing Bioshock and I am now, while writting this, downloading the next game.\n\nWould I recommend this? I don't need to say more, just play it!\n\nP.S: ALWAYS USE THE WRENCH","June 28, 2015","true","21.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I have well over a hundred hours, maybe even two hundred plus. It is my favorite game of all time, and forever will be. The story is written so well and every character is memorable, and the the world of Rapture is just so immesive to be in. Gameplay is also very very fun. It is in depth but not complex. That is a perk. This game will always be my favorite game, and if it isn't your's that's fine. If you haven't gave Bioshock a go, you must.

After your plane crashes into icy uncharted waters, you discover a rusted bathysphere and descend into Rapture, a city hidden beneath the sea. Constructed as an idealistic society for a hand picked group of scientists, artists and industrialists, the idealism is no more. Now the city is littered with corpses, wildly powerful guardians roam the corridors as little girls loot the dead, and genetically mutated citizens ambush you at every turn. Take control of your world by hacking mechanical devices, commandeering security turrets and crafting unique items critical to your very survival. Upgrade your weapons with ionic gels, explosives and toxins to customize them to the enemy and environment. Genetically modify your body through dozens of Plasmid Stations scattered throughout the city, empowering you with fantastic and often grotesque abilities. Explore a living world powered by Ecological A.I., where the inhabitants have interesting and consequential relationships with one another that impact your gameplay experience. Experience truly next generation graphics that vividly illustrate the forlorn art deco city, highlighted by the most detailed and realistic water effects ever developed in a video game. Make meaningful choices and mature decisions, ultimately culminating in the grand question: do you exploit the innocent survivors of Rapture...or save them?\ni recommend this game. 10/10.","February 16, 2015","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

This review is based on if you have NOT played any game in the bioshock series. Spoilers will attempt to be avoided, but that attempt may go wrong, read at your own risk.\n\nAs a side point, this is one of the first review's im writing for steam, so dont critique me on that aspect.\n\nThis review is present IGN style (Look em up on youtube), for a better, and visual review, look up Classic Game Room's review on youtube. I take no credit for either of these channels.\n\nStoryline and Background: Bioshock takes place in the beautiful city of Rapture, situated somewhere at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. In the game you play an unnamed protagonist, who is later revealed to be a man named Jack, this is quite obvious and no spoiler. The game begins with a plane crash near a mysterious lighthouse, investigation leads you to one of the greatest introductory levels in games i have played. You enter a Bathysphere, a sort of diving pod, which takes you to Rapture, during the ride, you meet Andrew Ryan, the games antagonist for a majority of the gameplay, who talks to you about his beliefs, and what Rapture is economically, pure capitalism. Bioshock's story progresses confusingly, and realisticly, until the sudden plot twist later that changes the game from a struggle against a powerful genius, to a fight for survival against the armies of a power hungry man. Another interesting thing is that background story is told through the enviornment (only slightly), and audio diaries found throughout the game. Next up, Presentation and Sound Immersion.\n\nPresentation and Sound Immersion: Bioshock is a completely gorgeous game, that is both immersive, and interesting. The art style depicts a wide array of colors and enviornments that is wonderful to look at. The enviornments, from the narrow passageways of Rapture's connection tubes, to the open spaces of the residential districts, are both realistic, and complicated. You want to explore all enviornments to find every bit of resources and information that you can, luckily a quest arrow at the tops points towards your goal once you get one, but it can be disabled in the main menu for a more immersive, and interesting experience. Sound effects are top notch, and add so much to Rapture's realistic yet confusing enviornment, from the strange chatter of the Little Sisters, to the deep growls and noises of the Big Daddies. Now, for Gameplay.\n\nGameplay: Bioshock's greatest selling point, to many, is it's gameplay. The game gives you a wide variety of weapons, from a simple wrench to the powerful crossbow, to kill your enemies, but that is not all that this game gives you. What makes the Bioshock series as a whole unique is its Plasmids and Gene Tonics. Throughout the game you will encounter Big Daddies, these large, hulking men in a diving suit are some of the toughest opponents in games. These Big Daddies protect the Little Sisters, in my opinion the most inconic and well known thing in Rapture. These Little Sisters harvest from corpses a genetic substance known as Adam, the most prestigous and valuable resource in the game, and the only way to get it is to harvest of rescue the Little Sister, which requires dealing with her Big Daddy first. Big Daddies are tough opponents even on easy, ESPECIALLY on your first or second time through the game, you can expect to die many times in the early Big Daddy fights. Their difficulty is balanced by the rewards obtained through Adam. Depending on if you harvest of rescue, you can either get more or less Adam, but if you do choose to rescue, the Little Sisters "caretaker", Tenenbaum, will reward you at scripted ammounts of rescues. Adam is used to purchase Plasmids, Gene Tonics, as well as upgrades to your abilities, although some plasmids are found as part of the story. Plasmids are genetic superpowers, which range from a bolt of lightning from the fingertips, to hypnotizing or engraging even the most powerful enemies. Gene Tonics are passive, which require no activation for use, and can range from speeding your character up, to combat bonuses. All this combined with an exceptionally intelligent AI and well thought out levels make Raptures gameplay better then most games. Now, for the verdict.\n\nVerdict: Although, to most, Bioshock 1 is considered the best in the series, i consider it the worst. The confusing nature of Rapture's enviornments, the annoying hacking mechanics, and the difficulty of Big Daddy fights is enough for me to lower the rating to the lowest, IMO, for the series.\n\nOVERAL VERDICT: 8.5","January 28, 2015","true","202.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The main selling point is the story, which is pretty damn great, and the world of BioShock is developed through Audio Logs and brilliant set piece moments. The guns are the standard setup of Melee, Pistol, Machine Gun, Shotgun, Grenade Launcher, Crossbow and the special weapon this time, the Chemical Thrower. Each of these weapons has 3 ammo types, standard ammo, Armour-Piercing and Anti-Personnel. In the supporting cast are ‘Plasmids’, powers such as Electro-Bolt, Incinerate! and Insect Swarm to name a few, powered by EVE.  Also, for some RPG-esq customization, they’re ‘Gene Tonics’, which you can equip, chop and change to your heart’s content. There’s a reasonable selection of dudes to fight, Melee, Gun wielding, Grenadiers and Spidery ones. The creepy Little Sisters wonder around BioShock, and gather ADAM, a wonder substance used for creating Plasmids and drugged up most of the people in the game. In Game, ADAM is used to buy and upgrade Plasmids/Gene Tonics, and presents the moral choice BioShock has. But first you have to fight Big Daddies, which at first is a big challenge, but then later is too much trouble.\n\nHowever, it’s not without problems. BioShock is in no way challenging, and you get showered with Health Kits and items to recharge your EVE, and ammo. I didn’t really bother with the alternate ammo types, the regular types were just fine. I did go to the maximum slots for Plasmids and Gene Tonics, but I also found I was only using 3 Plasmids and about 4 Gene Tonics in each of the three categories. On the note of Gene Tonics, certain combinations are gross. For example, I was doing increased Wrench Damage, had silent footstep, received 25% less damage from most sources, 100% less damage taken from electricity while dishing out an additional 60%, and I did electrical damage whenever I got hit by a melee enemy. And that was only in combat! I had easier hacking, plus I received additional health from health kits, and an increased to both Health and EVE. ADAM simply isn’t as important as the game would have you believe, especially since how much of an effort it is to fight Big Daddies.\n\nThe Vending machines for ammo and general items were largely untouched by me, mainly for the reason that I didn’t need them, along with the half-arsed crafting system. I was only making Auto-Hack tools in the end, which brings us onto Hacking. Hacking is bloody awful, as you have to play Pipe Dreams to hack a system. In the end, I was just buying out or auto-hacking systems, as money was largely useless and I really couldn’t be arsed. A lack of inventory is also strange, so you eat food straight away as you pick it up, you never know how much of a weird item you’re carrying for crafting, and not being able to dual-wield Plasmids and a gun is really, really annoying, especially since you have to swap with right click.\n\nOh, and the final boss fight is awful.\n\nOverall though, I really enjoyed BioShock, and would greatly recommend it, as all the problems I cited are largely insignificant in the grand scheme. As a final note, the whole 'Moral Choice' is a bit too Black and White, and something in the middle would have been much better.","June 18, 2015","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The gunplay is a little lacking, but core gameplay is really fun, especially with all the environment context reactions to your powers and special ammo.\nThe game is not Short by anymeans, and has plenty for you to search/explore and plenty of hidden goodies and secret locations in the game.\n\nStory is great, but I will not spoil it","July 17, 2011","true","28.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's good to pick up new skills, it feels good to shoot with your weapons or to thunderstrike with your hands, but if i compare this to his father (System shock 2), the game feels, sure, more dynamic, but ridicolously easy and criminally short.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nStory: 8/10\nSoundtrack 8.5/10\nReplayability 8.5/10\n\nThe "must play" for every player that likes RPG-FPS kind of game, and the starting point to whoever wants to begin a genre like that, it's a pity that there aren't as many games as bioshock 1.","November 9, 2015","true","16.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It may be a few years old, but I couldn't tell from the graphics, which were still stellar. The story is extremely well done and engaging throughout- you will be searching for every voxophone and going down every side corridor to learn more.\n\nGameplay was also very fun- I played on Normal difficulty, which was challenging enough that I was never bored, while not being hard enough that I was frustrated. There weren't too many weapons to choose from (and to be honest some just didn't seem that effective compared to the standard Wrench) but I never found myself bored or distracted by that fact. Same with the Plasmids (basically, magic spells)- I almost always used the standard Electric Shock, but the others were still interesting and the gameplay forced you to use some of the other Plasmids in order to unlock secret areas or find hidden voxophones which advanced the story.\n\nIn sum, I would give this game an 8/10, with a recommendation for people who want an engaging story to go with their gameplay.","June 27, 2014","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ampitere/recommended/7670/","ampitere","Ampitere","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ampitere/","203 products in account","A steam punk horror FPS that will leave your jimmies quite rustled. Bioshock is the first game introduced into what would later become one of the best non-conforming FPS games to date. Filled with many twists and turns that will surely leave you scratching your head and really bringing the undersea world of Rapture to life. Bioshock is an intriguing title that tries, and sometimes fail, to spook you at every turn. The rusted and dilapidated environment accompanied with the pitter-patter of water hitting the  iron-clad walls and floor will bring the city of Rapture to life. An exhilarating story with many M. Night Shyamalan twists that really make the player sit down and think about what has happened through their experience in Rapture. A game that definitely has a story with a punch, but with some lacking basic fundamentals you'd expect to find in a FPS. Unfortunately, Bioshock isn't the best FPS for a number of reasons including difficulty when using spray (it's better to use guns as if they were semi-automatic for accuracy), a lot of the enemies move in strange ways that will cause them to complete dodge your shots if they're a certain distance from you (makes it very difficult unless you're aiming low when they are meleeing), and worst of all your only melee weapon is garbage even with all of the upgrades equipped. This makes medium to long range fights the best for you but there's constantly something running at you in your face. The FPS mechanics do take some getting used to and are pretty interesting, the fact that you don't zoom with right mouse button but with Z is definitely something most FPS don't do. Over the years the graphics have held up very well too and at the time of it's release it was hailed for it's intense computer requirements (thankfully much easier to acquire now). Bioshock is a title that deserves respect and while it's not fundamentally the best game the story is worth at least one trip though.\n\n☆★★★★ Overall  ☆★★★★ Gameplay  ★★★★★ Story  ☆★★★★ Graphics  ☆★★★★ Sounds  ☆★★★★ Oddity  ☆☆★★★ Length","July 21, 2014","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
