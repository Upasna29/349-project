Its an amazing game in concept that I would love to give the chance to be great...if it could manage to do that. Its a piece of garbage that is thrown together into a contraption that just barely manages to reach its goal (oh wow, I totally just explained the entirety of the gameplay)\n\nIs it a cool idea, yes. Is it a fun game, ...hard to say because its basically unplayable. Several times has this game refused to work...or has done something so ...wrong I can't fix it even with the included time rewind. Imagine Prince of Persia: Sands of Time with its time rewind except instead of being a game mechanic that is cool and awesome its a tool used to make sure that if you break the game you can rewind to when it wasn't broken. Like...you can rewind time...which is ONLY used to fix mistakes either you or the game has made.\n\nThere are some levels I remember playing that I don't know what to do on, the goal is obviously there, but no meaningful solution is there to reach it. Most the time, I just tried to get as many flying items as I could to strap to myself to fly over everything so I wouldn't have to deal with the terrible game.\n\nFinally, I know in full well that I did not beat this game and so I cannot honestly say my review has full credible weight...but I did give it a good try, I wanted this game to be fun and work.. knowing full well it could be bad. I was let down, I write this in hopes that you are not let down. I would say.. perhaps plead with you to not get this. Its not a bad game, its unplayable.","April 14, 2014","false","2.9"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","0"

It's not that's that terrible a game, it's just that it's not worth your time or money.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it started out fun. The whole "build your own vehicle from found parts" idea is interesting, but it quickly gets tiring and annoying when things don't go together the way they should.\nThe explanation of how things work isn't very good, especially your ability to rewind time. And the level design is pointlessly confusing and some sections are unfairly punishing. There was more than one level that I spent much more time on than I needed to, just because I didn't understand where I was suppose to go next.\n\nAnd that's not to mention all the times I got stuck because the game bugged out and failed to register something I did. The worst example of this was on the very last level, when I got the last piece of the time machine (which is your overall goal for the game). I attached it to the rest of the time machine, and that (apparently) should have ended the level. Instead nothing happened, and I spent another hour or so trying to find where I was suppose to go next. I tried rewinding time to re-recieve the part, to trigger the end, but that didn't work either. It wasn't until I replayed the whole level that it finally worked.\n\nI'm happy to be able to say I got to the end of this game, but I haven't completed it. There are so many things (toasted sandwiches & robot heads) to find, and achievements to do, it's pretty hard to complete.\n\nThat said, some of the dialogue is pretty funny, and the environments are pretty cool. It really was fun to start with, but it ended up a bit of a chore to get to the end. Also, the controls are wack!\n\nOverall, had this game had half the bugs, it would've been pretty good. Unfortunately, it's a buggy mess.","April 25, 2014","false","6.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The problem is that once you've designed a two-wheeled bike with an umbrella, spring and rotablades all round, in some sort of trash-pile mess, you realise that there's very little imagination needed. Glue all parts to the engine and it works. Also, poor, generic level design will have you easily forgetting what level you are on; there's green, there's ice and there's fire. Not that any of these are particularly well done either. The designers just assumed you'd come across the levers that open the doors without giving you any indication where they should be or what they open.\n\nThe building is as irritating as the physics are twitchy. The movement off vehicle is slow and you'll often die because he fell in a certain way.\n\nAnd let's not forget the 'hilarious' banter between Sack and the Doc. Which wouldn't be a problem except that the speech bubble also gets in the way sometimes.\n\n\nI also had a problem when the game decided to corrupt all my saves at one point. Not something I've seen in a game for a long time. Might be a one off.\n\nOn the plus side, you can rewind time to correct any mistakes. You'll be using this a lot. Not because you will fail but because it is easier to rewind than rebuild after being hit by a projectile that came from an enemy outside the screen.\n\nIf you want to use your creative mind to solve puzzles (not that there's much puzzling here) try Crayon Physics instead.","April 8, 2014","false","4.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

For short, the developer solution was that you can theoretically put everything "inside" the seat, with just a bit sticking out, and it will still work.\n\nThe game took about 2 hours for me to beat, and then there was a lot of stubborn-ness in not wanting to rebuild the vehicle, since it's always a pain.\n\nIt had great promise and was enjoyable to some extent (thus why it was finished to the end) but all of the hassling around the physics makes me not able to really recommend the game. Took me a week to beat it since I couldn't stand playing it for too long at a time.\n\nPlayed "casually", one level or so at a time or 10 minutes at a time... sure. You can save and quit at any point. Just don't expect an all-over enjoyable experience.","August 4, 2014","false","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can't complain because I was given this for free so I really didn't waste money, I wasted time.  The is a puzzle game with a great art style.  In the beginning of the game they help you so much, but as soon as you get to level 2 the tips, help, and arrows that point you to the objective are gone.  This frustrated me a lot. Thinking I'm going the correct led me to a death pit. When I am going the right way it takes be 30 mins +.  I don't maybe I'm not good at puzzle games.  Verdict, first 1 hour was great, vibrant colors, characters personality, and creativity glued me to the game until I hated it 5 hours later. This is my opinion and I suggest only buy it if you outstanding at puzzle games and have a lot of patience (you'll die alot).  The game sells for $5, if you are going to buy it, buy it on sale.","August 1, 2013","false","4.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","3"

As far as the controls using the middle mouse button to flip an object around was annoying to me and hard to use and thus I used the keys assigned on the keyboard.  The graphics to me are not what I want usually in a game but I guess the developers went for that Paper Mario look and still though it just isn't good.\n\nStill I think so far there is enough to like about this game as it is a thinking man's game. So glad Indie developers have come around and become bigger in recent years cuz I don't think EA and other big publishers and game makers would bring us games like this themselves.  Thank goodness for Indie develiopers.\n\n(Please note I got this game in some sort of Indie Bundle as an extra and so did not pay $4.99 like people have to on Steam to get it.  Do I think it is worth $4.99?  I assume it is but I haven't played through it long enough to know how much content there is and thus could get a better idea of what the game should be worth when I do that.)","January 6, 2014","true","0.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

If you are playing this game expecting mind blowing puzzle you are in for a huge surprise; puzzles are easily solved by smashing your vehicle against buttons or walls. The only real challenge this game possesses is the ability to completely infuriate you during creative vehicle construction, the collision problems within the game makes attaching materials to your vehicle way harder than it should. Since the entire game is focused on constructing these monstrous creations, you’d think the developers would actually find a way to make building stuff as perfect as possible. The story is average at best, and the attempt at humor is weak. I didn’t have a single “lol” moment in my entire play through. To be quite frank this game barely passes as an average puzzle plat-former.","September 9, 2012","false","51.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"
