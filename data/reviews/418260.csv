Table top games makes for a fun experience in VR. I still feel the game needs more objectives. maybe this will come in a future update.\nHere is my video :\n\nhttps://youtu.be/3cpHInZw_Zg","April 5","true","0.7"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","19","28","3","1"

As someone who needs to activate nearly all comfort settings for most games, I can greatly appreciate how easy this game is on me.\n\nThere are 10 different race tracks with 20 different vehicles; many of which must be unlocked. Thanks to that this game has a lot of staying power and keeps pulling me back for more. Dozens of environmental hazards and power-ups kept me engaged during the race, and dominating other racers feels extremely satisfying.\n\nThere's a multiplayer option, but sadly there aren't enough people playing right now in order to give it a fair rating. Hopefully once people recieve more of their headsets and as VR takes off I'll be able to play the multiplayer with others! A local multiplayer option would also be an amazing addition.\n\nOne issue I had with the game is it loaded me in very close to the ground, and it was difficult to see the track. It turns out the solution to this was setting up SteamVR in its seated/standing experience. I use the Oculus so I was unaware of how to use SteamVR, but once I got through that issue the game was a lot of fun and I'll continue to be returning for more. I can only imagine how fun it would be to have a Vive and walk all over the track!","May 7","true","1.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I like the tiny toon style cars, it riminds me of when I would like with slot cars or hotwheels. At first the races were too slow, but after I made the change in options to 'hard' setting it was perfect.\n\nWould love it if there were more players for the multiplayer mode becuase I think it would be awesome in multiplayer.\n","May 22","true","1.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It turns out that I like sitting and playing VR even better!\n\nThis game is like an arcade racer, where you see the entire track layed out before you and it seems to take up your entire room. You can get up and walk around the track, is down in the infield and watch the cars race around, its pretty cool.\n\nThe AI is pretty good, while at first it was too easy, I just changed the difficulty to hard and after I did that, the races were super challenging. There is a mutliplayer option as well, but I did not spend any time playing that yet, ive mostly just played single player.","May 26","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I downloaded the game for my son and as soon as I started it up, it was offcenter and can't be full screened or adjusted so you can't see whats going on. All you can see is a tractor literally in front of the main menu. And then if you can figure out how to accidentally start the game you play the whole game from a fixxed position behind a crash wall barrier. Like I said, worst waste of $20 I've ever done in my life. And I once bought my own ♥♥♥♥ back from a thief once.","April 14","false","0.1"," 8 of 62 people (13%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","13","8","62","5","4"

I have purched the $35,000 car twice now. Only to have it Locked the next time I log in and all that cash is gone both times... Other than that is is a fun little racing game. Maybe a bit steep on the asking priced considered it is not as polished as I would have hoped.\n\nHTC Vive","May 29","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
