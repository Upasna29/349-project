It's the same principle of stacking colors but you need a special orb to pop the bubbles unlike columns where you just need three.\n\nThe main objective is to fill the enemies screen of blobs before your side fills up. When you get good combos your special bar increases and then you can use special moves.\n\nThe colors on this game are bright and vibrant and the music is nice too. With online and local VS this game supports a lot more fun than the traditional AI.\n\nI would most definitely recommend this to fans of Columns, Tetris-\n\nMy preview video shows more, I feel it's easier for me to video log stuff down.

Games like Tetris Attack, Super Puzzle Fighter, or Bust a Move have constantly been in my library or installed games list because they're so easy to pick up, but extremely difficult to master and dominate.\n\nHeroes Never Lose definitely fills that gap that I've been asking for and with tasteful flair. The setting of a world where (almost reject) superheroes  gives a quirky humorous tone that immediately welcomes the player. It plays very close to super puzzle fighter but with special abilities that each character possesses. The online works great, and is a welcome addition to this type of game as you'd typically play against someone sitting next to you [which is obviously the best way to play].\n\nis good, get it\n","November 24, 2015","true","2.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

It revived the idea beautifully, with Powerful satirical (and generally respectful) Plays on Precursor comic icons and tropes for the flavour. My interest was Piqued Past the Proverbial face of the game, especially by the varied character mechanics that were more than just counter-block Pattern differences. The addition of specials and supers, abilities available after generating enough Points from block-breaking, compelled me to test out more than just one or two characters. The abilities were unique enough; some options had similar use, but the difference in implementation was enough so that nothing felt redundant.\n\nI'd recommend this to almost anyone, from casual Players to those experienced in the genre.

Uno de los focos principales son los videojuegos. ¿Qué pasa si esto lo juntamos con otro tema popular hoy en día que son los super héroes? Podemos conseguir cosas como Heroes Never Lose: Professor Puzzler’s Perplexing Ploy, si, ese es el nombre.\nHeroes Never Lose comenzó como un proyecto en Kickstarter que luego fue creciendo hasta lograr su objetivo (cosa que es difícil en éste mercado) y así poder salir a la luz con ese extraño y largo nombre. Desarrollado por Magic Pants y publicado por Spearhead, Heroes Never Lose salió al mercado el 23 de Noviembre de éste año, llevándose una muy buena recepción del público.\n\nTe nombré superheroes y si, podríamos decir que el juego tiene algo de temática estilo fighting, pero no es como te lo estás imaginando. Si tuvieramos que describir la temática podríamos decir que es un juego casual, de esos con puzzles. Para hacerla fácil, es similar al tetris.\nExísten varias opciones de juego. Podemos jugar el modo Arcade, Versus, y también Online. En cada uno de los modos tenemos una amplia selección de personajes, lo cual es lo mas distintivo del juego. El diseño de personajes es algo a destacar, al igual que la descripción de los mismos. Muchos son personajes bastante estereotipados pero con una vuelta de tuerca. Claramente, todos son una especie de super-héroe o villano con distintas cualidades y stats. Algunos te van a recordar a personajes de cómics muy vistos.\n\nUna vez tenemos nuestro personaje elegido podemos jugar contra la máquina, contra otro jugador que se encuentre con nosotros si es que lo jugamos en consola, o contra otro jugador online. Todos los modos se componen del mismo puzzle, un tipo de Tetris en el que tenés que ir alineando cuadritos de colores para formar combos o cadenas que te darán puntos. Esos puntos son recolectables y sirven para conseguir poderes que podrás usar contra tu adversario. Cuantos más puntos juntes mayor será el daño que hagas luego. La barra de poder se va llenando en tres instancias, siendo la última una especie de super combo que le hará casi imposible ganar a tu contrincante.\nOtro detalle que se destaca en éste juego son los diálogos. Si, tiene dialogos. Claramente no muchos porque se basa en otra cosa, pero usualmente a lo alrgo del juego los personajes tiran comentarios divertidos que hacen de la experiencia de juego mucho más dinámica.\n\nLa música es otro factor a favor ya que al no ser el mejor juego indie del mundo, le aporta mucho, además de ser muy pegadiza. (Acordate de mi cuando estés tarareándola todo el día). El estilo chiptune definitivamente es lo que mejor encaja en estos juegos.\n\nSi bien no es una recomendación absoluta, definitivamente es algo que hay que jugar ya que no es un puzzle típico como la mayoría, tiene sus vueltas y es bastante divertido. Ideal para pasar una tarde con amigos y reírse un rato con los comentarios tan inteligentes de nuestros personajes.\n\nPuede conseguirse en Steam y también está disponible para WiiU.","December 24, 2015","true","1.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Plays well, controller compatibility is a plus for a title like this, and the music and graphics will take you back with nostalgia thrills. But in all honesty, for a puzzle title like this, the retro arcade graphics probably work better than something brushed up and smoothed with complex textures. This makes the game feel more raw and likable, and five or ten years from now could still be enjoyed without cringing a little.\n\nThe Normal setting was a bit of a cakewalk, so I'm yet to try my luck with the hard setting.\n\nThe "superpowers" that are character specific is a very neat touch to the gameplay. Instead of generic power-ups for everyone, each person gets their own power that is best used in certian situations over others. Professor Puzzler's power is by far one of the most annoying personally.\n\nOnline and local multiplayer is a plus and overall; if you like drop style puzzle games that have or have the potential to be competitive, this is a definite buy. An absolute MUST if it's on sale.\n\n9/10 - Awesome!\n\nP.S.

A descent puzzler with nice comic books inspired graphics, various characters, a touch of humor...\n\nMechanics are simple, you destroy color blocks on your side of the screen with special smash blocks, so you can fill your enemy's screen with random annoying blocks that cannot be destroyed along with your other blocks, for 5 turns.\n\nSo, what's wrong with that game?\nWell these damn smash blocks appear randomly. And obviously at some point your opponent got ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of em, and you got none.\n\nThat's not a big deal on easy difficulty (there's no challenge at all), but when you get to harder difficulties, AI gets cheated, and keeps sending you countdown blocks, without even destroying his owns. This makes no sence, winning a game gets more about luck than skills. I haven't raged this hard in a while.\n\nBesides, controls are not really good, and you cannot even bind your own keys...\n\nYet, this is an early access, I still hope they'll make a good game out of it, but as for now, and considering the price, I wouldn't recommand it.\n\n3,5/10","June 5","false","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You choose a hero/villain and try to keep your playing field as free of blocks as possible. Get four blocks together? They become a super-block and deal massive damage when you land a block-buster on them. Additionally, each character has a special and an ultimate attack that you can trigger depending on how full the special gauge is.\n\nEach stage has an animated background and depending on how well you're doing your character's stance and such will change.

I have a ton of time on Tetris, Puzzle Fighter, Puzzle League, and Puyo Puyo.\n\nThis one is just dissapointing in many respects. People say the controls feel "tight", but I can't say I agree. The way held inputs are handled is strange (snapping to the side), and rotations can't be applied without interrupting the movement, making things seem sluggish.\n\nIt's hard to build chains due to the multicolored crash gem, which appears often.\n\nSome of the characters, like Professor Puzzler, have specials that discourage going for big attacks. (His scrambles the field of the opponent!)\n\nMany aspects of the game feel unfinished. There's no real story, but then once you beat the arcade mode you get a bunch of text on the screen talking about characters that weren't really introduced. After this, the credits rolled for me and the music stopped halfway through.\n\nThis isn't a design flaw, but it seems like nobody is really playing online. That is a shame, since I found even the hard AI trivial to beat.

Okay, I've found it. Still think it would've felt betters on the character select screen.\nIt's too heavy on the graphics and there's no option to lower the quality. My game froze and crashed several times, once it even took Steam  down along with it.  No way to access the options from the pause menu either, which is just sad.\nNo mouse controls, even for the menus, really?\nA tutorial would've been nice, I think.\nAnd also again, some of the losing animations were impossible to see behind the playing field which took a while to disappear after the win/loss.The idea is nice but I find that the execution is somewhat lacking.\nI'm hoping that these issues might get addressed in the future but meanwhile I guess I will still keep playing for some time. Does not require much concentration after all, which is what I'm looking for in casual games.\n\nP.S. I know it's unrelated to the game itself but I expected to see some gameplay in the trailer. Unfortunately, there wasn't any, so I had no clear understanding what kind of game I was buying, except that it was some kinda mix of tetris and three-in-a-row. Meh, whatever, right?\n\nEdit 3/17: changed a few things around based on recent experiences.","January 9","true","12.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's incomplete and the mechanics are unfair","January 24","false","0.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

(Long story short on that I was left fighting an unwinnable battle due to the AI flipping a tile endlessly and never getting a new one.))\n\nMusic, isn't the best and a lot of it sounds the same, other than Dr puzzler who I wish I had the time to fight without risking going over the 2 hour limit.\nI don't see how this brings any thing new to stacker games other then slapping a super hero skin on it, they don't even have two of the heroes that are on their icon, let alone all the ones you see in the pictures. (Isn't that false advertisement?)\nThe stats mean nothing as even while playing as the fire girl I swear I just got the same odds for cleaning any other element, and of course she claims high fire but this could just be something my foe has to deal with rather than myself I admit.\n\nNow for the good...\nIt looks nice like really nice....\nIt's hard to beat if your into that, no really easy mode nearly gave me a loss I shutter to think how the harder AI is WITHOUT CHEATING!\nDr. Puzzler, wish I could have had my fight with him without worrying over the 2 hour limit his music was great he looks fresh and I would have liked to see what he attacked with over the element attacks I'd seen in other puzzle games, not counting gun nut that was kind of cool.\n\nNever got a chance to try 2 player but the sad thing is there is nothing else other then this.  No gimmick battles no story it just have a very bear feeling to it, OR it feels like someone that loves to draw made this because I loved the looks but there felt like little polish anywhere else.  If you already have a stacker game there is no reason to buy this game otherwise wait till you see it for 3 bucks.\n\n(If this review gets scraped due to me wanting a refund ah well I've said my piece hope the makers improve the game more and I hope you reading this, if you bought the game I hope you enjoy it and don't have the bad taste I had.)","November 30, 2015","false","0.9"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","2","8","0","0"

Like the famous Super Street Fighter Puzzle Turbo ! .... But once I played, it's really ridiculous : not a lot of gameplay, characters are useless, slow, no fun .... You'll play it few minutes after saying "ah ok .... Well ... Next ! "\n\nToo bad ...

The combo system brings a fresh touch to the Puzzle Fighter Formula and I will be playing this a lot with my friends.\nThere are just two things right now not sitting right with me.\nFirst off: please give us an option to turn off the animated backgrounds\nSecond: the reason why I like Puzzle Fighter was the big and shiny bricks. Especially the HD remake looks so great.\nWould it be possible to at least increase the size of the hole box and the columns ? At the moment it's just too tiny.\n\nThanks for this great puzzle game.","May 1","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But there is one thing, It needs a color-blind option. Everytime those numbered blocks come I can't tell if its the fist or the lightning. Other than that though its a fun little tetris-like game. Not worth $9, but I'd pay around $2-3 for it.","June 2","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
