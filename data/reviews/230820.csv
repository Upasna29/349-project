The game is either perfect - like Memoria - or consists of a perfect idea ruined in rushed display - like Whispered World. On a 50-50 gamble, I took my chance and I'm happy to declare that The Night of the Rabbit went to snatch itself a place among the perfect ones.\n\nMeet Jeremiah Hazelnut, a young boy who lives in a forest hut with his mother, and it's the last two days of his summer vacation. Young Jerry ventures out to the forest to find himself an adventure before dinner, and ends up meeting a strange rabbit named Marquis de Hoto who offers Jerry the great opportunity to become a wizard's apprentice! Marquis promises Jerry that he'll be home before dinner, and takes him to the village of Mousewood, where he'll be trained in the art of arts: magic! As Jerry proudly declares: Anything's possible on a day in summer vacation!\n\nBefore getting into gameplay, I'd like to take a moment to talk about the atmosphere of the game. The whole setting is already captivating with beautiful 2D art backgrounds, enchanting soundtrack and loveable characters as if they are taken out of a beloved children's book. Aside the trademark folklore themes of mainland Europe, numerous other mythologies are carefully wrapped up into a well-balanced setting of its own in this wondrous little tale. Character depth and storytelling are marvelous, voice acting is stunning and dialogue interactions vary between conjuring a warm smile on your face and inviting you to sudden striking realizations on human nature. Don't let the cute setting fool you; I took a pause to consider the wisdom behind an unexpected remark made in game more than once.\n\nFor the gameplay: it is a bit more than your casual point and click adventure. For the most part of the game, you are presented with a townful of people and places to explore, and also a handful of side stories and/or quests to accomplish aside the main scenario with card rewards. Item combinations are imaginative, yet not obscure at all. With some observation, it is possible to go through the whole game. Through his adventures, Jerry will learn some spells that will enrich the gameplay and present you new options of exploration; like talking to statues, growing plants in mere seconds, changing shape... and even make impossible, possible!\n\nOne of my favorite parts in the game is that you are encouraged to collect some mysterious cards in your explorations which you can use to play a card game named Quartets with the town's inhabitants. It is a lovely mini game that takes some attention and an exercise of memory. The game also contains some collectibles for you to look for - like stickers, dew drops and stories told by a mysterious woodspirit. They are not a must, but collecting them reveals some side lore to the game that you may enjoy very much. Every detail is carefully placed to make a whole masterfully. There is a variety of things to do in this game which offers at least 10 hours of gameplay roughly.\n\nAs a final word, when I chose to play The Night of the Rabbit, I wasn't expecting this kind of quality in setting, story, narration or gameplay. This is a wonderful and imaginative tale that I'll remember for a long time. Jerry's tale might have ended here, but I wonder if Mousewood or Marquis made their last appearances... I wish not.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","November 20, 2015","true","14.6"," 73 of 82 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","73","82","0","2"

In my opinion, they are one of the premiere developers of point-and-click adventure games today.  All of their games have a certain "charm" about them that make them so appealing.  Well Night of the Rabbit may be the quintessential example of that "Deadalic Charm."\n\nThe puzzles make sense for the most part, and there are in-game hints which can help you along.  The artwork is amazing and the soundscape is phenomenal. I really liked the music.  The voice acting is well done, although some of the lines are a bit forced and a bit corny. And the overall story is intriguing and well-told.  Also, I experienced no glitches/bugs or crashing. It is an undeniably well-crafted game.\n\nIt is also a rather long game for the point-and-click genre.  It does drag on a little towards the end.  One thing that most Deadalic games do well is timing, where they end just as they start to get old... but this one definitely has an hour or three more than it needs to.  So: if you get bored of games easily, you might want to be aware of this.\n\nThere are  lots of extras in the game that you don't commonly see in point-and-click games, like collectibles... and even a card-based mini-game similar to gin/go-fish.  Although I personally thought they could have made the card game more fun (it is very luck based), it was a cool little extra.\n\nAll in all, though, I thought this was a great game.  Probably Deadalic's best work so far.  If you are a fan of point-and-click games this is a must play.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","October 31, 2014","true","16.0"," 63 of 69 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","63","69","0","0"

The music, the art, the voice-acting, the story, and even the hidden collectables are magnificent.  Even if you use a walk through the whole time (some of the puzzles are less than intiutive), it is worth playing and sharing.  The creators even included 8 recorded stories, beautifully written and read, as one of the collectibles.  The dedication and care put into this game are evident and the experience is inifinitely better for it.  After playing it through once, I would happily play it again, just to get all the collectibles and enjoy the story once more.

As soon you start the game, the first thing you will notice is how unique the art style is. With warm and vibrant colours, The Night of the Rabbit is the perfect (summer) adventure to play any time of the year, it's easy to fall in this world, it's charming and will win your heart, if you allow it. Without giving too much information, it's wise to understand that not everything is what's appear to be. There is plenty of mystery and magic surrounding Mousewood with plenty to see in a selection of different locations.\n\nFilled by imagination and creativity you will encounter puzzles through your journey. Depending on your perception, these can be easy to medium difficulty while others may take some time to understand. You will have to meet new people, do some favours, help others, gather materials and much more in order to advance the Story. While advancing through the game you will listen the amazing soundtrack that makes a nice companion. It's already easy for you to fall in the story due the charm of the art style but music always played an important role in these types of games and it's great to see that such role was not ignored during the creation of the game.\n\nWhile playing the game, enjoying the scenery, listening to the music, narration and other character's stories it took me about 14 hours -give or take- to finish the game. Not once I felt the rush or need to end the story in a quick session or two. It's a pleasant game to play in a very calm and relaxed environment that will leave you stuck to your monitor until the very end. If you are like me, I do enjoy to play certain games during certain seasons of the year. With Autumn coming soon and then Winter, The Night of the Rabbit is the perfect fit to play after a long tiresome day or during that rainy, cold afternoon while having some warm coffee or tea by your side to keep you warm. I know it may seem odd, but having a nice surrounding while playing some games can make the immersion even bigger (and better) and this is something important while playing any type of game.\n\nIf you are a fan of point and click games, intriguing stories and astonishing visuals thanks to a well drawn art style, then this may be the game for you. It's a game telling a story, a game that asks the player not to see a journey but to go with it and tag along as you play Jerry, the main character.","September 30, 2014","true","14.2"," 32 of 32 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","32","32","0","2"

A great story, beautiful music, hand drawn art and clever puzzles, and it all works together perfectly. A near perfect point-and-click adventure experience.\n\nLets start with the music. The first thing you hear when you start the game is a melodious theme that can only be described as the game in music form. It is near indescribable how perfect the main theme is. The rest of the music is also amazing, enhancing the atmosphere of the game, deepening the emotion of various scenes.\n\nThe hand drawn art is beautiful, has a unique style, and is a perfect medium in which to tell the story of Jerry and his journey into the realm of magic. Visually, the game is very pretty to look at, but it's the attention to detail that truly brings this fantasy realm to life. In addition, the transition from cut-scene to game is near seamless. You almost can't tell you're watching a video.\n\nThe story is just as mystery filled as you'd expect from a journey into the realm of magic. The intro does a great job of setting the tone of the story, and it carries all the way to the end. Jerry's story is told near perfect, the conclusion of his story is satisfying. But the end is so open, with so many questions remaining, so much left to explore. So many avenues for further adventure. I really hope this game gets a sequel. It truly deserves one, crafted with the same love and dedication.\n\nLike all point-and-click adventures, the gameplay is as you would expect. You use the mouse to interact with the environment, the people and objects within. The items you collect are then used to solve a variety of clever puzzles throughout the game. Many of the puzzles are crafty, and even though you can see the solution, there's always another clever obstacle to overcome. The puzzles are very seamless in execution.\n\nYou can observe all the objects you can interact with by clicking on a magic coin in the inventory (a clever means of integrating a gameplay element into the story). This is a brilliant addition to point-and-click adventure gameplay as it's sometimes easy to miss key items lying around. The only downside is that the coin only shows the interactive elements for a moment, too short to take in everything. You can continuously observe the interactive objects by holding the shortcut key (holding spacebar), but it would have been nice to have the mouse implementation be given some better functionality.\n\nThere is also a minor bug where you sometimes can't open the inventory by clicking on the backpack. There were only two points in the game where I observed this. The first was after exiting the boat, but going to the title menu and then returning to the game fixes this. The second one is more annoying. At the outpost in the frozen land (and only at this screen), the only way to access the inventory is via the inventory shortcut (pressing I). The mousewheel method of accessing the inventory may still work, but I never used it so I can't say. The bug is a minor annoyance, and to be fair, it's the only bug I encountered throughout the game.\n\nThe Night of the Rabbit is exceptional. I recommend it to any fan of the adventure genre.","January 2, 2015","true","30.7"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","36","39","0","0"

The visuals are stellar; it gives a very winnie the pooh-esque vibe that fills me with nostalgia. The characters are adorable and the writing in terms of dialogue is fantastic. This is just not an enjoyable GAME. Mind you, I've played Walking Dead, all of the Monkey Island games, three Ace Attorney  games, All three seasons of the new Sam and Max games, I even played a few Myst titles and Milo. This game has very little understanding of common logic. You grind every piece of furniture and tools in where you wish for it to go. No characters are helpful in terms of advice, some even lie to you about how you are expected to solve certain challenges. What frustrates me is what clues ARE given are just vague enough to drive you crazy. Puzzles like "draw on a rock" in the middle of several areas FULL of rocks can be quite maddening. Or perhaps you have all you need to solve a puzzle with a certain character, but the game refuses to recognize your solution until a certain amount of other events have come to pass elsewhere. Some Point-and-Clicks are quite guilty of this, but never has such a problem stopped me dead in my tracks so utterly. When I played past games and came to a solution, I felt satisfied, happy even. Here, I am frustrated at how much time is lost due to a require psychic understanding of the programmer's problem solving. I will give the game credit: the story is stellar. A very Whovian quality to the intention. I would reccommend watching it. or playing through it with a guide. But this is a very frustrating adventure game. If there was a more straightforward way to offer hints, or if the level design wasn't built to offer misleading soutions, I'd reccommend it. in it's current form: I only say watch it for its story.","November 30, 2013","false","9.9"," 129 of 196 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","129","196","0","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bombadilsboots/recommended/230820/","bombadilsboots","Bombadil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bombadilsboots/","63 products in account","There's a lot to say about this game. There's so much about it that I loved, and though it has its flaws, I think the pros far outweigh the cons.\n\nFirst and foremost, the real pleasure of this game is in exploring the world. Its environment and ambiance are fantastic. The art style, the many yet small world-building details, the sense of history and mythology, and the characters populating Mousewood all give layers upon layers to this world. And that's just the area in and around Mousewood--as the plot progresses, more worlds are opened to the main character, Jerry, and though they're less detailed than the "home world" of Mousewood, they're each interesting and beautiful in their own ways. They all contribute to the overall environment. I was definitely immersed.\n\nSecondly, the story. (I won't give an overview of the basic plot, because the previews and official overview tell you everything you need to know on that front.) In the early stages of the game, I wasn't sure if the central plot would really solidify, and that might be one of the game's flaws--the main plot takes some time to launch. In the beginning of the game Jerry spends most of his time helping the inhabitants of Mousewood in small ways. The purpose is obviously to familiarize the player with Mousewood and with all the characters, and in that sense it did contribute to the world-building; however, it did feel a bit slow in places. When hints of the central plot did show through, they seemed a bit disjointed, all vaguely connected but with no discernible purpose or relationship. It was almost like soup that wouldn't thicken, and it did distract me at times. However, as I got farther into the game (especially at about the halfway point), the hints started coming together. The soup thickened. And the further I played, the more I found the story to be multilayered and imaginative. The final scenes of the game really click everything into place. The end made me want to immediately replay the game so I could more fully appreciate all the hints dropped in the beginning.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a pro or con, but the puzzles were largely unremarkable. There were a few stand out puzzles I enjoyed, but for the most part they were pretty obvious.\n\nThe real flaws of the game, in my opinion, are more mechanical than substantive. The voice acting is often overwhelmed by the music/ambient noises in the game (bird calls, wind, bug noises, etc.). I'm not really sure what the problem is, if it's particular to my computer or to the game's software (I think it's probably the latter), but in many scenes I could just barely hear the voices with my speaker volume turned almost all the way up--which is a shame, because I liked the voice acting that I could actually hear. Sometimes there are strangely-placed, longish pauses in dialogue that feel awkward and make scenes drag. And though I do love the art, the moving animation can be a bit stilted.\n\nWhether or not you buy the game depends on the experience you're looking for. If you want something fast-paced and high-action, I would pass. If you're looking for a fun, detailed world with colorful characters, and you have the patience to wait until the very end of the game to understand the full complexity of the plot, then I would highly recommend The Night of the Rabbit.","December 27, 2013","true","43.0"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","1"

It contained puzzles that you'll have to solve, it's not that hard and pretty simple for a nuthead like me to play (although I have to admit to looking up the guide list).\n\nEven completing the story I had to replay a secondtime only because it was really amazing and I wanted to collect the 'Bonus' storylines as it felt like an 'afterstory' to The Night Of The Rabbit.

That game is "The Night of the Rabbit", alternatively called "The Rabbit's Apprentice".\nAlthough the title is not a major problem of the entire game (considering how most of the game is focused on a young 12-year-old boy named "Jerry Hazelnut"), it's harmless enough.\nIn my opinion, this game feels ENCHANTING to play through. From the moment you start playing it from the moment it concludes. It's exactly how I feel a magical adventure needs to be driven. Obviously, I haven't played the Deponia series yet, so I wouldn't be familiar with the gaming elements that Daedalic Entertainment incoporates in their line-up of game titles.\nThe story has a couple of pacing issues here because of the puzzles but even that dosen't deter that the puzzles are creative and thought-provoking (not to a brain-aching degree). The puzzles in this game were logical and that makes it much more prouder. But when the story picks up, it's usually around 6 hours into the game. Turning from a light-hearted beginning to a dark twisting turn towards the end. The story is deep, complex and revolves around the dark side of Mousewood. Many people might find this to be a derivative story, as Harry Potter had this kind of plot also but while I find it not the best story a game has to offer, it's enough to make a game to support it.\nThe HD-graphics provided in the game are lush, clear, vibrant and sometimes colourful and really blends in with the tone of the story. Throughout most of the game, I took most of the magical setting of Mousewood and wanted Daedalic to expand more on the mythology of Mousewood as my interest is high.\nThe music is absolutely WONDERFUL and it matches the music quality of Rayman Origins as my favourite video game soundtracks of my past gaming experience. Throughout the soundtrack, it follows one leitmotif and is heard in a couple of variations throughout each track and if you recognize that leitmotif, you'll know the whole game. Tilo Alpermann has done a great job of captivating the story of the game and transpired it into music.\nThe characters are also well done, too. Each character I interact with has their moment on the screen. There is no comic reliefs, no over-the-top characters and DEFINETLY NO LOVE INTERESTS. The characters here are subtle and help add more to the story, development to the main characters and more to the history and setting of Mousewood.\nHowever... the voicework is a bit off. Most of the time, the acting ranges from "not even trying" to "I'm REALLY trying" and yet comes off as a first read of the script, with Jerry becoming the weakest.\nThe sound mixing is inconsistent. For example, I had my music volume to 50 and my voice volume to 100 and yet I STILL cannot hear a word they were saying half the time. But a subtitles overlay option available resolves the issue.\nThe dialogue was OK, but sometimes, the dialogue in the game can be a bit repetitive, as if they were trying to help pad the length of a point-and-click game. Repeated lines like a laugh, a "Bah!", or even "mumbles", "whispers", croaks" & "snores" really makes me want to skip that portion of the dialogue. Sometimes, the characters in the game tend to slow down the speed of their dialogue to an absolute snail's pace.\nThere were also a couple of bugs and glitches I spotted during the 3rd act of the game and that almost ruined the game's experience for me as it lags, stutters and just stops, and I had my computer down to the lowest settings.\nOh, and the "Quartets" mini-game is the worst mini-game I have EVER played. The reason being is that the card game is like "Go Fish" and the opponent ALWAYS KNOWS WHAT CARD YOU HAVE!\n\nIf you are a huge point-and-click fan, BUY THIS GAME. If you like being challenged with thought-provoking puzzles, BUY THIS GAME. It's one of those point-and-click games that wants to be explored and will be with you forever.\n\n7/10","June 9, 2013","true","16.2"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","2"

If I should compare the game to Daedelic's "Deponia", which is the only other Daedelic game I played, I would say Night of the Rabbit managed to capture me much faster than Deponia did. Of course  Deponia was also split into three games which is kind of the killer for me (Still loved it though). Night of the Rabbit became more and more interesting and exciting the closer to the ending it got and does not leave me with disappointing questions in the end.\n\n9/10 - The only problem I have, which is a problem I have with all puzzle games, is that I suck at them. Not the games fault, but at least the game was wondrously interesting enough to (find a walktrough) keep playing and complete.","July 22, 2015","true","18.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

Graphics (9/10)\n\nAh, this section is where the game truly shines. The background environment is really beatiful with a mystical charm to it and almost every parts of the game are interesting to view. No doubt that they have heavily emphasize on the artwork that compels you to explore further into the world of anthromorphic inhabited world of Mousewood.\n\nAs for the characters, they are drawn in 2D graphics which works well for the beautiful background and simple to look at them. Quite a large amount of characters in here and most are based on animals.\n\nDespite all that, they are some minor problems I have seen in this game, in a sense with the dialogues that appear on screen does not match with the voice acting. However, it isn't really bad enough to ruin the experience.\n\n2.) GamePlay (7/10)\n\nAs for this part, it is a simply, straight to the point clicking around until you make progress story wise game. It is a nice of them to include in a short tutorial on the controls and it was done in a fun way. As you continue on, you are required to solve many puzzles along the way, which requires you to combine items and using them. There are also  some puzzles which requires to be done in a certain order that would only work. No doubt that some puzzles can be challenging and you have to think hard in order to solve it.\n\nUnfortuntely, some puzzles can become cumbersome, back tracking involved routine and rather vague, despite the fact that you can refer to your journal which sadly offered only minimal help. There were a few several times when I got stuck completely  and had no choice but to end up relying on a guide by other players, which I have to admit this is a bit disappointing and it may cause some players to shy away. All in all, the puzzle part could have use more thought and polishing to it by the creators but still the job is done well enough for an indie game.\n\n3.) Sound / Voice Acting / Music (8.5/10)\n\nOh boy this is another part where the game shines too, whereby most of all the characters (Except for a few particular residents of Mousewood) had their own voice acting that fits their personalities and appearance very well. From the main character to the most minor characters, it is nice to talk to them and listen to their various quirky and serious dialogues altogether.\n\nThe music is really good too, even the main menu for a simple click adventure game can sound really mysterious when paused. Every parts of the game had their own distinct music and in my opinion it fits well on every mood.\n\nHowever, the most annoying part of the game is that during the process of solving a puzzle and if you made a mistake, you are forced to listen many of the same lines over and over again but thankfully this can be easily mitigated by simply skipping with clicks of the mouse.\n\n4.) Story (7/10)\n\nThe main part of the game, hmm to be honest I have mixed feelings about it. You play as a young boy by the name Jeremiah Hazelnut or simply called Jerry, a very tenacious and curious boy who would one day strive to become a famous magician. He is currently on a summer holiday which will end in two days and so Jerry decides to spend his two remanining days looking for adventures in an innocent child perspective right nearby the comfort of his home that lies at the edge of the town in a forest. As time passes, a strange mysterious letter appeared inside his mailbox and in it contains an magical incantation and an invitation for him to come over into the world of Mousewood.\n\nJerry then gladly follows the instructions on the paper and with that it summons a very strange yet interesting character which happens to be an anthromorphic white rabbit namely Marquis De Hoto. The marquis turns out to be a magician and also a TreeWalker, who is capable of traversing through various portals found at certain places only and their main job is to help its inhabitants,  protect and restore the balance of many worlds. Being a naive minded yet excited typical of a boy, Jerry agrees to be his apprentice in order to become a great magician and from there the story continues.\n\nThe first part of the game starts off pretty slow but as the game moves on we start to dwelve deeper into the mysteries of Mouseworld and other worlds that Jerry will visit in his quest, which picks up the story. But sadly, towards the last part of the game feels kind of rushed, sloppy and the ending, in my opinion was a bit lacking in its punch and left a few things unanswered. I'm not sure if this was intended by the creators to open for a sequel which I hope it may bring a closure to it.\n\nThere is also the bonus content if you purchase the premium version of the game, it brings some stories which sets in the same universe of Mouseworld that you can see and unlocks along the way in your game play which brings a bit more content of the game\n\nConclusion (8/10)\n\nIn short, The Night Of The Rabbit excels in its Graphics and Audio department but slightly spoiled by certain tough puzzles and the lack of proper conclusion to the story as well as the quality dropping towards the end. Still, it makes for a good experience and I am certainly looking forward to seeing  a sequel being made for this game.","November 18, 2014","true","12.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

It recalls the sense of wonder, yet subtle danger, that I remember from some classic animated films like the Secret of NIMH - the kinds of stories that prove they can be kid-friendly without talking down to their audience. Great beauty and admittedly cute characters exist in the shadow of a palpable darkness, with an intriguing mystery of the Marquis overlaying it all.\n\nThis game does fall into the trap, like so many adventure games, of having several overly obtuse puzzles, but this is at least relatively minimal. The positives more than outweigh this: solid and simple interface, a well-written story, outstanding voice-acting, and some of the most beautiful scenes you'll ever see on your monitor.

If I were to describe Night of the Rabbit as X meets Y, I would say it's half Alice in Wonderland, half Wind in the Willows, which basically makes it a children-oriented fairy tale with furries and outlandish characters demonstrating thinly veiled moral points. Join Jeremiah Hazelnut in a quest to become a magician while also learning the importance of staying level-headed against adversity. Most of the game takes place in and around Mousewood, a pitoresque society of assorted small animals, and while at times the story turns a bit campy and preachy, it is, for the most part, an enchanting journey for children of all ages. In terms of quality and production value, the hand-drawn style fits the setting perfectly, the voice acting and music are more than adequate and the rich content (achievements, collectibles, side stories and a Go Fish-type card game) adds a layer of pixel-hunting to the otherwise simple puzzles. Although I detect a certain oscillation in the writing and animation quality (at times, tNotR feels more like an homage to LucasArts than a spiritual successor), I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a weak spot for fairy tales and puzzle solving, perhaps doubly so as an introduction game to the genre.\n\nBUY IT if you:\n-Are a child, either literally or at heart, and would rather curl up with an A.A. Milne book in front of a fireplace than join a gang and wack pigs in South Central.\n-Enjoy lightweight adventure games and intuitive inventory puzzles.\n-Are a fan of Daedalic Entertainment and the highly derivative but otherwise funny and enjoyable Deponia series.\n\nDO NOT BUY IT if you:\n-Want mature content in your entertainment or expect any kind of deep or complicated plotline to keep your juices flowing.\n-Are a hardcore point-and-click adventure fan and are sick of all those "combine tuft of hair with stick to obtain brush and then use on an obvious brush-lacking trigger prop" newbie puzzles.\n-Find the ten or so hours of raw gameplay unsatisfactory for whatever price it is at the time of purchase.","December 10, 2014","true","20.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","6"

Decent music and graphics (comparable to Deponia series) and voice acting wasn't bad either. From a pure technical point this game is comparable to other Daedalic titles, so I picked it up as I've enjoyed every one of them so far.\n\nBUT the story turns out very weak. The main character is like a toddler Guybrush Threepwood, the story weak and shallow. Dialogue lines don't change after the first conversation, which makes it tedious if you have to explore more deeply.\nThe biggest problem I had with the game was its puzzles. The puzzles mostly make or break a game of that kind. Puzzles of this game often times don't follow the story and you have to talk to random people or try random stuff to progress. Some puzzles are illogical and often times the solution is set in strict trails. Two simple examples:\n- for one puzzle you have to polish a trophy and put it on a window sill. The only way to solve the puzzle is to put the unpolished trophy first and polish it after it won't be accepted. You cant polish it beforehand although it's obvious you'll have to.\n- for another puzzle you have to plant a tree that will soak up water. If you try that at night, you wont be able to and get a generic message. You have to change to daytime to plant the tree and it will work.\n\nI've run across this kind of stuff all game long, making it a very tedious experience. Good point & click games will give you hints, so you stay on track. This game will give you nothing , even if you did everything right and didn't follow some stupid random rule.\n\nSome puzzles have week puzzles, some a week story, but this has both.

Before my review I would like to note that this was my third point and click adventure game (all from Daedlic) so I am not particularly experienced on this field.\n\nStory:\nIn my opinion the strongest point of the game. As the description says we follow the adventure of a young boy whose dream is to become a magician. On a summer vacation anything is possible! It sounds like and starts out as a light-hearted fairytale with talking woodland animals. (It reminds me a bit to The Whispered World.) However, even the starting cinematic hints that there are more to it. The story picks up slowly as Jerry, on his training to be a Treewalker, first just do all kind of chores for the locals, which took about half of my game time. But the subtle referances that things weren't as they looked kept me going. There are a couple of threats looming over Mousewood, the home of the woodland critters, some more immediate and more apparent, some not. The initial innocent tale about talking critters expands into a complex one with harsher elements. I find the plot intriguing and creative. It has more than one layer and gives a couple of twists in the second half of the game. We get answers to some of the mysteries, but at the same time more questions arises. There remain some loose ends hanging, that makes me hope there will be a sequel.\n\nGameplay:\nThere is only one click option, and the game decides whether you look, talk to, pick up, etc your target. Jerry's adventures centers around a place called Mousewood and its close surrounding. He needs to visit same places over and over again, but some other, smaller areas open up briefly too. The game lacks a bit on exploration-wise in my opinion. There are riddles, hidden objects and lots of item combinations. Unfortunately I found myself often opening a guide because my logic works differently than Daedlic’s. During his training, Jerry learns some useful spells. With the help of them some previously inaccessable places open up or he can interact with objects in new ways, which sometimes help solving puzzles or give extra flavour to the game. After a while day and night cycles are introduced too which, again, alters how and where we can interact with objects and people. There are collectible items too, built in, simple card game (the pictures on the card you collect too) and audio books as bonuses. I think these are good, refreshing ideas which brings the game above average. Unfortunately the puzzles I don’t find particularly interesting unlike the ones in The Whispered World.\n\nCharacters, voice acting and dialogues:\nJerry’s behavior is belivable and suitable to a 12 year old child: how he impresses himself when he manages something, his goodwill and slightly naive attitude to the wold, playful and adventurous. I find him a likable main hero. He meets lots of different creatures (funny ones, charming ones, witty ones, etc) and they have all well thought-out personalities. The voices are fine and matches the characters. There are a decent amount of dialogue options, and fortunately we can replay most of them or at least get a summary afterward.\n\nMusic:\nThe game isnot short on them. I really like the menu music and some of the in game ones, but there were a few which slightly annoyed me hearing it over and over again.\n\nGraphic:\nCharming cartoonish characters and spectacular, detailed backgrounds. I can only say good about it.\n\nOverally I think The Night of the Rabbit is worth its cost. Because of its setting it is perfect for younger audiance, but it can suit well for older players just as well due to the deeper thoughts arising later during the plot. I don’t think it is the best game when it comes to puzzles but it definitely has some nice features, and because of the story I might even replay the game to see it evolve again, now with a better understanding of what is what and who is who in real.","November 23, 2014","true","20.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Kudos especially to the young fellow who did the voice of Jeremiah Hazelwood.\nPoint and click games are my favourite and the navigation and mouse control were much appreciated; no queasiness from first person keyboard navigation!\nI would LOVE a sequel....\nRECOMMENDED!","July 10, 2014","true","26.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

The story is awesome and the puzzles are clever. It has a nice world to explore, lovable characters, great music and graphics. It's the sort of game you can become really immersed in. I played it over a few days; it was kinda like a book you can't put down.\n\nIt was hard to get into at first because the dialogue was so slow and drawn out and it seemed so innocent I thought it must be made for kids, but it's definitely not - the story is actually pretty dark, and it even has a bit of a twist ending. I didn't decide to buy it until I finished the demo. Unfortunately I had to play it from the beginning again once I bought the game. My only criticisms are the slow and wordy dialogue (which you can click through quickly or escape out of anyway), and a bit of bugginess with the cursor (there were some small objects that I didn't realise I could interact with because the point to click on was actually lower and to the right of the object).\n\nI think the puzzles could all be figured out with enough wandering around clicking on things, but it depends how long you can stand to be stuck on one puzzle. I had a walkthrough open that I used to give myself a hint if I was stuck. I just carefully scrolled down to see only the next step after the steps I had already completed. It would be great to be given clues, as I hate to ruin the experience by using a walkthrough. The journal does sometimes give you clues though.\n\nSome of the puzzles are really simple, some take more thought, and a few I don't think I would ever have thought of. However, most of the time I looked at the walkthrough I realised it was totally obvious, or I could have figured it out if I had thought about it more / tried more things / explored more.\n\nAs someone already mentioned, there is a lot of pointless dialogue to sit / click through, like "hmmmm", laughing, grumbling, etc. but this is a minor issue. It can be irritating but doesn't really affect the enjoyment of the game. I found a lot of the dialogue and the characters amusing, so I didn't mind too much.\n\nOverall... really great game. 10/10.","October 12, 2014","true","22.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

And don’t let the theme fool you: this game is as much for adults, as for children.\n\nLong version:The Night of the Rabbit is a wonderful magical fairy tale from Daedelic Entertainment, the company which really knows how to make a modern 2D adventure game.\n\nThe basic premise may sound familiar: you play as Jerry Hazelnut, a 12-year-old boy, who suddenly finds himself in a magical world where he becomes a wizard-in-training with the ultimate goal of saving the Forest from the evil magician.\nThe setting uses the same cartoonish forest inhabited by talking critters we saw in hundreds of children’s books, but this doesn’t make the game dated or old, quite the opposite. This world was crafted with lots of love and care, which is also shown in the almost three hours worth of audio books (unlockable in the game, included as additional download in the special edition). And the story won’t disappoint either… it’s fun, it’s clever, it’s charming, and more importantly, it’s perfect even for an adult.\n\nStrangely, the same goes for the puzzles, but in a wrong way. The initially harmless and easy obstacles quickly turn into desperate try-everything-with-everything scenarios. Even the plot has a few dark twists, setting a more adult tone, which may create an uncomfortable discrepancy between the first and second halves of the game.\n\nAll stages feature jaw-dropping graphics and lots of detail, and the English voice cast with their charming accent fits the theme perfectly. The same cannot be said for the acting, but it’s nothing major to really worry about.\n\nOverall, it’s an excellent adventure to embark upon, whether you are young or old, so put on your wizard hat and have fun!","October 28, 2014","true","17.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

(Spoilers will be noted throughout the review.)\n\n+BEAUTIFUL music. All of the music fit wonderfully with each and every scene.\n+Lovable characters. Every little creature in Mousewood (save one or two) caught my attention and made me love them almost immediately. They're freaking adorable.\n+Voice acting. The voice acting was great. A little bit awkward in a couple places, but fun nonetheless.\n+The graphics are lovely. They usually have a good deal of color to them and can set a scene very well.\n\n+The mini-game, Quartets. This, I can say without a doubt, was a fun little game. I loved it. The point of the game is to...well, it's like go-fish, only instead of getting a pair of two cards, the goal is to get all four cards of a suit and make a quartet. Whoever has the most quartets by the end wins, and you can play with ALMOST everyone in Mousewood. I genuinely enjoyed the mini game.\n\n+/- Story. Story was...meh. The story was very...grindy up until the middle where The plot finally came into play. The only thing that kept me interested that long was my love for a couple of the characters. Even towards the end of the story (SPOILER), it got so bland and many of the questions posed in the game were not answered properly. There was so much more that could have been done with it. (Jerry's dad? Anyone know that guy? Who is he again?)\n\n-Puzzles. Puzzles puzzles, those freaking puzzles! I cannot even begin to explain my frustration with those puzzles. Several times I rage quit because they just made no sense to me at all. I put the game down for a week or so on several occasions, and then came back, only to have to resort to a walkthrough, Honestly, the puzzles are what spawned my dislike of this game. It's all either trial and error (and error and error and error) or go find a walkthrough. Most of the puzzles make little to no sense at all, and the hints given to you are obscure. You're given a spell called "Advice Seeker" and more often than not it doesn't give you any suitable hints on what to do to actually progress in the story. So for a good long while I was wandering around, wondering what on earth I'm supposed to be doing. When I found out "hey, this guy needs some ____!" and actually got him some _____ he wouldn't take it. Why? Because he's picky.\n\n-Dialogue (when using items and such). BECAUSE there's so much trial and error to this game, there's going to be a lot of your character telling you that's not how this item should be used. But...could they at least do it in a less annoying way? The reason I hated the trial and error because Jerry's response (over and over again) was always (the same thing every time you used a certain item) something along the lines of "Mmm...I don't think so." or "That doesn't go there!" or "That doesn't need any special spice." (yes. yes that's a thing.) It gets tedious. And annoying. Very quickly.\n\n+/-The Audiobooks. Throughout the game, you will come across a fascinating character. In fact, you meet him in the very first scene. The Wood Sprite. He's a great guy. He loves telling stories. Later in the game, he'll give you stories which are saved in your bonus collection as audio books! Ain't he swell? Yeah, well...that's all fine and dandy, but the audio books are (I don't know what else I expected them to be) quite long for my taste. Especially when I'm trying to rage through puzzles. The books are somewhere between 8 and 15 minutes long (though I've only listened to two) and a bit monotonous. I actually dozed off a bit during the first one. (However, I was in a dimly lit room at the time.) So...they're cute, but long. And they take a bit away from the immersion (if you ever manage to gain any) in the story.\n\n+/-The ending (obvious SPOILER here). Gods. I don't know what to say about that freaking ending. It was just so...anticlimatic that if it wasn't for the explanation of the past of my favorite character in the game (Marquis de Hoto/the rabbit) and why he was having his troubles throughout the story, I would have downright put the ending into the negative section of this review. The last puzzles were fairly simple compared to the rest of the game which made me rage a bit, given how...boring the results of the puzzles actually were. The actions of Jerry (the main character) during the last few scenes were not even remotely impressive. You would think if you spent all that time learning about the inhabitants of Mousewood and all those spells you would at least be able to use them in a SLIGHTLY impressive manner. But no. Not Jerry. The final battle was downright upsetting, as well. It was...one hundred percent different from anything else done in the rest of the game. Okay, maybe not one hundred. Maybe like ninety-five percent. Everything about the ending was just...bland and altogether anticlimatic and IT LEAVES SO MUCH UNTOLD. SO. MUCH.\n\n\nAll in all...no, I would not recommend this game, at least not at full price. Maybe at like...75% off, but not full price. It left me so disappointed. The only thing that raised my opinion of it at the very end was the Marquis. No, I would NOT play a sequel to this if one ever came out, not unless they severely dumb down the puzzles. Or at least make them reasonable.","May 14, 2015","false","16.3"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","21","37","0","3"

It's a beautiful game that is different from any other point and click game I've played for free or otherwise. When I began to play I wasn't sure if it was worth the money, but upon completing the game I think it was well worth it. The Night of the Rabbit has such a rich vibrant story there's little more I could ask for (especially in a world littered with games that have little to no actual plot). The game art, soundtrack, and voice acting are nothing short of sensations. I cannot emphasize enough for truly awesome the story of this game was. If you're some who enjoys the plot of a game I would highly recommend this to you. This game isn't without its flaws, but now I'm just being nitpicky. I would have maybe liked a little more guidance when trying to do some of the tasks in Mouse Wood. At times it was difficult to figure of what I was trying to do, and I would have to consult a walkthrough for guidance, despite this it was still fun to solve the puzzles and complete tasks.\n\nDo you recommend this game? YES I'd recommend it to just about anyone. It is simply an over-all good game. I don't think I could have been more pleased with it. I may not play through it again anytime soon, but it now has a place in my heart, and I know, one day, I'll come back so I can go on this beautiful adventure again. I look forward to that day.

But there are some complaints: a glitch where the dialogue would flash through at incredible speed and you'd have to exit the scene and come back to get it at the right pace again. A couple of other glitches include not being able to complete achievements (for the LIFE of me I couldn't get the Snail sticker, clicking on it does nothing) and sometimes the game will freeze, or the mouse will disappear and I'd have to close the game and relaunch it (SAVE OFTEN).\n\nThe puzzles are unfortunately not very intuitive, and the 'advice' spell is literally next to useless. To those claiming that the dialogue is too long and when you accidentally click into an interaction you'd have to click through it all again - just press Esc. This will instantly end that conversation.\n\nBut overall, it was an enjoyable experience. The art is beyond reproach and really gave you that old nostalgic feeling. The characters are likable (except Humbert - I would dearly love to drop-kick him into the brook) and I thought they were mostly well developed. The story is certainly very interesting, although the environmentalist message seemed oddly shoehorned in, and the crow problem was never solved, though the townspeople claim it has been.

Also, the game takes a while to really get going, and this could put some people off (it almost did that to me). Some of the cool spells acquired later have great potential, but are usable in just very few situations - some just have one or two uses in all - which is a bit disappointing.

However, this little adventure game didn't bore me at all!\nIt reminded me a bit of Alice in Wonderland (because of the rabbit and another world setting) or Harry Potter (because it's about magic) or Grimm fairy tales (because of the fairy tale and all those mice and all). However the story and the setting is quite fresh. It's like without a meaning on one hand, on the other it's just a masterpiece.\n\nDuring the game you collect playing cards. They'll be used for an extra card game, which is pretty fun and you can play it also after you finish the main game.\n\nThere're also some kind of improvement in your movements later on in the game, so that you don't need to wait ages till your protagonist reach a point you wish him to reach.\n\nThe length of the game is satisfying. It's not short. It's not very long. It's just reasonable. Getting to the credits can take you around 19-20h of gameplay. I haven't noticed any bugs.

Little did I know, that the charm of this game goes so much deeper than just the beautiful art. I cannot begin to express how much I loved this game. I just couldn't stop playing it, I was so excited to see what happened next. I know a lot of people don't get steam to play point and click games, but I reccomend this game for everyone.\n\nPros:\n- Absolutely STUNNING art that left me speechless in multiple occasions.\n- A beautiful OST that fits the game atmosphere perfectly.\n- The puzzles were creative and not too easy, but not too hard as well.\n- Cute and likable characters with well rounded personalities.\n- Voice acting was very well done and fit the characters perfectly.\n- Outstanding story that isn't predictable. (At least it wasn't to me.)\n\nCons:\n- Depending on the person, some of the puzzles may be more complex than others. I had to pull up a walkthrough a few times when I was completely baffled at what my next step would be.\n- The pacing is a bit off in the beginning but it quickly makes up for that as the story progresses.\n\nI can't think of anymore cons for this game. I became emotionally attached to Jeremiah Hazelnut while following him in his great adventure. This game grabbed my heart and left me so happy I bought it. It was worth every penny. I can't wait to see what else Daedalic Entertainment has in store next.","June 20, 2015","true","17.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

The only one better are Chains of Satinav and Memoria but only barely. This is a amazing story that you'll just love. What makes this better then their usual stuff is that this game has a wonderful main character. Yes, there are some green vibes to it but it doesn't overwelm it either. The story is profound, the art is beautiful, and the music is perfect. There are moments in the game that send chills down your spine and possibly even tears. Plus, this is the only Daedilic game that includes things besides the story such as its own trading card game, short stories and collectables. The ending had a twist to it and I really hope it gets a sequel. It really deserves one.

The story didn't really catch my attention, but after finishing the starter quests I finally realised we are talking about a really good game here. Here is what you should expect:\nPuzzles: If you've played Deponia, the puzzles are way easier. I used the guide only 2 times through the whole game which surprised even myself, since in Deponia I used it about 20 times in each game (especially in Goodbye Deponia). Fun puzzles and straight to the point with many hints to tell you what to do.\nStory: The story, to be honest. is weird. Weird, but personally I found it quite fun. At a point it becomes quite emotional but the main character gets back on track and finishes it off with a happy ending.\nLength: Longer than most point and click games + it has a bonus collection where you collect stuff throughout the game (has also audio book which can give you more details about the story). I should go back and collect the rest, but oh well.\n\nIf I had to grade this game, I'd say 9.5/10 (lel.)\nThe story is just, weird. The game however is plain amazing, probably the best point and click I've played (placing it even above Deponia which is one of my personal favorites).\n\nOverall, a fantastic title worth playing.","April 29, 2015","true","11.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

The voice acting is top-notch and the music fits in perfectly. My biggest praise of this game is while many puzzle adventure games can quickly turn into "rub every item on every clickable thing in the wolrd untill something happens" The Night of the Rabbit managed to stay away from this. I only had to look up a guide once around the middle of the game because I got stuck. Somewhat frustrating because I had solved the puzzle but was basically trying to do a piece out of order, the logic was the same the game just got there in a slightly different way. Agian its bound to happen and I really only felt that way once.\n\nFinal thoughts is this is a great introduction to the genre with a story thats not complictaed but imaginative and very family friendly.

The creativity is just amazing and it makes for such an enjoyable game... Especially with the hint of the Ninja shadow bunny planeswalker!!! So cool. Definitely a thumbs up.\n\nNote : I had to complete the game with a walkthrough. The hints were really lousy.\n\nPROS\n1. Story\nSo interesting. It's great to see all the little details in the story slowly get unravelled as the game progresses. The blurred overlap between a boy who is dreaming up his own imagination and a real fantasy world is fantastic.\n\n2. Artwork\nFantastic. The details of Mousewood are so intriguing. The level of creativity is something amazing.\n\n3. Secrets\nDewdrops. Need I say more?\n\n4. Card Game\nVery cool. It's nice to know that there's another game designed within a game. It's the hallmark of the good game to have mini-games within the main game. E.g. Final Fantasy series. Do note that The Night The Rabbit is a simple game of Go Fish.\n\n5. Credit Ending\nNice to see that there was so much more. I won't spoilt the ending but there's a lot more to do. It's much better than the standard boring credit roll. I must admit that I didn't really pay attention to who's who in the credits though.\n\nCONS\n1. Frog Clicker\nVery tedious method of travelling. Can't you just blow on the horn to call Plato, the frog.\n\n2. Spells\nNot really useful except in specific circumstances. I was hoping for the spells to interact more. E.g. Stone Whispering spell was good as you could use it on all the statues, Green Growth and Fox's Cunning were a little too limited.\n\n3. Items\nWay too limited to be used only for specific locations. It would be great to use them on non-quest objects and Jerry would tell you if it was not important.\n\n4. Hints\nYou need better ones.","November 11, 2015","true","8.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The voice acting is top-notch and the music fits in perfectly. My biggest praise of this game is while many puzzle adventure games can quickly turn into "rub every item on every clickable thing in the wolrd untill something happens" The Night of the Rabbit managed to stay away from this. I only had to look up a guide once around the middle of the game because I got stuck. Somewhat frustrating because I had solved the puzzle but was basically trying to do a piece out of order, the logic was the same the game just got there in a slightly different way. Agian its bound to happen and I really only felt that way once.\n\nFinal thoughts is this is a great introduction to the genre with a story thats not complictaed but imaginative and very family friendly. Surely worth the $5 I spent on it when it was on sale, but a full $20 might be a bit of a stretch in my opinion.","November 9, 2015","true","15.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The creativity is just amazing and it makes for such an enjoyable game... Especially with the hint of the Ninja shadow bunny planeswalker!!! So cool. Definitely a thumbs up.\n\nNote : I had to complete the game with a walkthrough. The hints were really lousy.\n\nPROS\n1. Story\nSo interesting. It's great to see all the little details in the story slowly get unravelled as the game progresses. The blurred overlap between a boy who is dreaming up his own imagination and a real fantasy world is fantastic.\n\n2. Artwork\nFantastic. The details of Mousewood are so intriguing. The level of creativity is something amazing.\n\n3. Secrets\nDewdrops. Need I say more?\n\n4. Card Game\nVery cool. It's nice to know that there's another game designed within a game. It's the hallmark of the good game to have mini-games within the main game. E.g. Final Fantasy series. Do note that The Night The Rabbit is a simple game of Go Fish.\n\n5. Credit Ending\nNice to see that there was so much more. I won't spoilt the ending but there's a lot more to do. It's much better than the standard boring credit roll. I must admit that I didn't really pay attention to who's who in the credits though.\n\nCONS\n1. Frog Clicker\nVery tedious method of travelling. Can't you just blow on the horn to call Plato, the frog.\n\n2. Spells\nNot really useful except in specific circumstances. I was hoping for the spells to interact more. E.g. Stone Whispering spell was good as you could use it on all the statues, Green Growth and Fox's Cunning were a little too limited.\n\n3. Items\nWay too limited to be used only for specific locations. It would be great to use them on non-quest objects and Jerry would tell you if it was not important.\n\n4. Hints\nYou need better ones.","November 11, 2015","true","8.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was very impressed with the overall gameplay, the puzzles werent too hard. The insulting leprechaun was funny. But the storyline...ever elaborating.

In fact, the twist in The Night of the Rabbit is particularly jarring, given the otherwise cheerful/uplifting tone of the first half of the game.\n\nEven so, the game is beautifully animated, and it's so far my favourite of Daedalic Entertainment's games, with a story that will stay with me much longer, twists and all. In addition, the eight-story audiobook is a nice world-building bonus, and the Quartets mini-game is a fun distraction I wouldn't mind trying in real life, potentially adapting it for more players.\n\nDefinite recommend if you love animated point-and-click adventures like I do. Biggest complaint would be some minor technical glitches with dialogue, and that a lot of the end sequence is narration over black screens, but the amazing animation that IS shown more than makes up for it.","January 3","true","25.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Every time the sequels went on sale, I sat there staring and trying to debate if really fun gameplay was worth the insufferable main character and lack of actually engaging plot. Never could convince myself to. So I decided to try out this game instead, hoping for something better.\n\nNight of the Rabbit combined creative puzzles, an intriguing world, lovable characters, and a moving plot to far exceed my expectations. It was definitely worth the $5 I payed for it. I'd even go so far as to say it'd be worth the original $20, if I were the sort to ever buy games that aren't on sale.\n\nAlso, I am now in love with a large, anthropopmorphic rabbit.\n\nPros\n+ The plot is fantastic. It starts out as merely intriguing, leaving just enough mystery to keep you going. But as it goes on, the story gets more complex and meaningful--the pacing is just perfect to keep the tension and questions balanced until it culminates in a beautiful, but open ending.\n+ The characters are adorable, funny, and you'll probably end up more invested in them then you previously thought. Now, they are fairly simple characters (excluding the Marquis, who deserves an entire game devoted to his adventures), but I think this fits what I'm going to talk about next.\n+ It's got a lovely fairy-tale feel to it, so things that may seem overly simplistic actually work as part of its charm. But the plot and complexity of the magical world drive it beyond what most fairy-tales are made of, so the sense you get is less "simple" and more "nostalgic."\n+ Gorgeous art style, fantastic music.\n+ The world is endlessly intriguing, and it opens up bit-by-bit. Though you go back and forth between many areas, you unlock more bits and pieces of the map at a pace that keeps things fresh and interesting.\n+ Lots of creative puzzles. You also use many items more than once, which I think is more interesting and refreshing that gathering a bunch of one use items that mysteriously vanish once you use them.\n+ It has a few really clever gameplay elements that make the game more than "combine this item with that item" or "try using this stick on everything until you find something that works."\n+ The Marquis. Just... the Marquis.\n\nCons:\n- The animation could be a bit smoother, and there's a reliance on stock poses rather than unique reactions to events. However, it doesn't overly detract from the style.\n- Some of the puzzles don't make that much sense or are far from obvious. But I could say that about every point-and-click game I've ever played. Sometimes I'd think I was supposed to do one thing, but then it would turn out that I actually had to do the opposite. I think if the Advice Seeker spell was more specific (it was, for the most part, entirely useless in telling me anything I didn't already know), this could have been avoided.\n- Really could benefit from something like a quest log. There are so many different requests to keep track of, and the journal doesn't give much detail or organize them well.\n- Voice volume seemed to fluctuate and sometimes the music was much louder than the voices--and turning music down to almost nothing in the audio settings didn't help.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, my problems with it are very small and nitpicky. Long and short of it is, it's a great game, pick it up during the sale. You won't regret it.","June 15, 2015","true","13.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's okay, he does a good Job but he really is too old to act for an 12 year old Boy like Jerry Haselnuss. And the typical Humor of "Deponia" and other Games by DAEDALIC is completely lacking.\n2nd thing..most of the Music is wonderful. Really. But some Backgroundmusic during the Dialogues (when the Marquis is talking etc.) sounds like selfmade with old Synthesizers. Like old SNES Games. *brrrr*\nIn General i would say....I am too old for this Game (i am nearly 30). Problem is: the Game wouldnt even make fun for Children or so till 16, because most of the Riddles are very hard (as i have seen it's not only my opinion).\nSo the Game confuses a bit with its childish way of Storytelling, some moral-teaching aspects, Voiceacting and Art (like a childrens game), because it is on the other hand not made for Children, due to the fact of the hard Riddles and some hard-to-get-pieces of the Story (because they tell not much, whats going on anyway). And most of the Story is told in a cinematic (drawn pictures-slideshow) at the near end of the Game....somehow to explain everything. Even I was then like "aha....that's what all is about...." Instead of really telling the Story during the Gameplay-time).\nBut i have to say...the Graphics and over all "Ursula" are very cute. If you play it....I think at least you should be a woman or a man who loves Beatrix Potter, Animals and....Children's Books ^^""" Because while playing the Game i always had to think on her. And somehow i cannot loose the feeling that DAEDALIC is very "greeny"....telling children (or me, a grown up woman) about saving nature and the bad world outside constructed by enterprises XDDD  Overall......not for all DAEDALIC Fans.","April 30, 2014","true","14.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

One of the best point and click adventure games I have seen. The Night of the Rabbit has logical but sometimes challenging puzzles. Being able to use items several times instead of once wass surprising to find. An intresting mystery with hints to the truth are hidden if you do not explore. I found that this game was very refreshing from the usual dark fantasy or shooting games today. The atmosphere flows perfectly from easy going to being unnerving. This game is very subtle in the best way possible. If you like puzzles, story, mystery, or even indie games. Buy this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doragonraida/recommended/230820/","doragonraida","doragon.raida","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doragonraida/","100 products in account","This is the point-and-click game I've been waiting for.\n\nI played Deponia and loved the gameplay and art style... unfortunately, I absolutely hated the plot and characters. Every time the sequels went on sale, I sat there staring and trying to debate if really fun gameplay was worth the insufferable main character and lack of actually engaging plot. Never could convince myself to. So I decided to try out this game instead, hoping for something better.\n\nNight of the Rabbit combined creative puzzles, an intriguing world, lovable characters, and a moving plot to far exceed my expectations. It was definitely worth the $5 I payed for it. I'd even go so far as to say it'd be worth the original $20, if I were the sort to ever buy games that aren't on sale.\n\nAlso, I am now in love with a large, anthropopmorphic rabbit.\n\nPros\n+ The plot is fantastic. It starts out as merely intriguing, leaving just enough mystery to keep you going. But as it goes on, the story gets more complex and meaningful--the pacing is just perfect to keep the tension and questions balanced until it culminates in a beautiful, but open ending.\n+ The characters are adorable, funny, and you'll probably end up more invested in them then you previously thought. Now, they are fairly simple characters (excluding the Marquis, who deserves an entire game devoted to his adventures), but I think this fits what I'm going to talk about next.\n+ It's got a lovely fairy-tale feel to it, so things that may seem overly simplistic actually work as part of its charm. But the plot and complexity of the magical world drive it beyond what most fairy-tales are made of, so the sense you get is less "simple" and more "nostalgic."\n+ Gorgeous art style, fantastic music.\n+ The world is endlessly intriguing, and it opens up bit-by-bit. Though you go back and forth between many areas, you unlock more bits and pieces of the map at a pace that keeps things fresh and interesting.\n+ Lots of creative puzzles. You also use many items more than once, which I think is more interesting and refreshing that gathering a bunch of one use items that mysteriously vanish once you use them.\n+ It has a few really clever gameplay elements that make the game more than "combine this item with that item" or "try using this stick on everything until you find something that works."\n+ The Marquis. Just... the Marquis.\n\nCons:\n- The animation could be a bit smoother, and there's a reliance on stock poses rather than unique reactions to events. However, it doesn't overly detract from the style.\n- Some of the puzzles don't make that much sense or are far from obvious. But I could say that about every point-and-click game I've ever played. Sometimes I'd think I was supposed to do one thing, but then it would turn out that I actually had to do the opposite. I think if the Advice Seeker spell was more specific (it was, for the most part, entirely useless in telling me anything I didn't already know), this could have been avoided.\n- Really could benefit from something like a quest log. There are so many different requests to keep track of, and the journal doesn't give much detail or organize them well.\n- Voice volume seemed to fluctuate and sometimes the music was much louder than the voices--and turning music down to almost nothing in the audio settings didn't help.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, my problems with it are very small and nitpicky. Long and short of it is, it's a great game, pick it up during the sale. You won't regret it.","June 15, 2015","true","13.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's okay, he does a good Job but he really is too old to act for an 12 year old Boy like Jerry Haselnuss. And the typical Humor of "Deponia" and other Games by DAEDALIC is completely lacking.\n2nd thing..most of the Music is wonderful. Really. But some Backgroundmusic during the Dialogues (when the Marquis is talking etc.) sounds like selfmade with old Synthesizers. Like old SNES Games. *brrrr*\nIn General i would say....I am too old for this Game (i am nearly 30). Problem is: the Game wouldnt even make fun for Children or so till 16, because most of the Riddles are very hard (as i have seen it's not only my opinion).\nSo the Game confuses a bit with its childish way of Storytelling, some moral-teaching aspects, Voiceacting and Art (like a childrens game), because it is on the other hand not made for Children, due to the fact of the hard Riddles and some hard-to-get-pieces of the Story (because they tell not much, whats going on anyway). And most of the Story is told in a cinematic (drawn pictures-slideshow) at the near end of the Game....somehow to explain everything. Even I was then like "aha....that's what all is about...." Instead of really telling the Story during the Gameplay-time).\nBut i have to say...the Graphics and over all "Ursula" are very cute. If you play it....I think at least you should be a woman or a man who loves Beatrix Potter, Animals and....Children's Books ^^""" Because while playing the Game i always had to think on her. And somehow i cannot loose the feeling that DAEDALIC is very "greeny"....telling children (or me, a grown up woman) about saving nature and the bad world outside constructed by enterprises XDDD  Overall......not for all DAEDALIC Fans.","April 30, 2014","true","14.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I tend to gravitate towards the dark, horror sort of games, but I adore anything anthropomorphic. This is also in a deeply discounted bundle of games, so I thought, why not? Even if all the other games are awful, this game made my puchase worth it.\n\nThe art is fantastic, reminiscent of a leatherbound fairytale book. While playing, I often found myself admiring the details of the enviroment and characters. The characters are loveable and intriguing. The voice acting is superb. I really feel like a lot of care was taken while choosing a voice for each character. I think the dialogue is a bit repetitive at times, but it is just a click ("One click - everything's just one click!")  to hurry past the more monotonous parts. But the story... What an entertaining, interesting, heartbreaking, endearing, fun. thought-provoking story. (And the bonus stories!! So well-written!!) Set to a pleasing soundtrack, 'The Night of the Rabbit' is quite lovely.\n\nWith all that being said, there are a few scenes in the game where it seems like the character faces don't really match the situation, and it kind of lessened the immersive experience for me. A character receives serious information while smiling... Another says a tearful goodbye with a face of contentment. The voice acting swoops in to save the day, though, and it isn't anything that ruins the game. Also, some of the puzzles are quite difficult, with little to no direction of what to do next. This leads to either a LOT of guessing and misdirection, or the use of a walkthrough. But, this also leads to a strong sense of satisfaction when a puzzle is solved.\n\nOverall, 'The Night of the Rabbit' is a stunning game, with a story I hope to see continued. I would absolutely love to meet these characters again. Thank you, Matthias Kempke!","March 11","true","13.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Genuinely impressed.\n\nNormally point-and-click adventure games tend to either be bland, or only hold their draw for a short time and a single playthrough.\n\nThis one is incredibly deep.\n\nWhat starts as an almost stereotypical childish adventure slowly gains layers of complexity, without losing any of the charm that a childish adventure can have.\n\nThe gameplay, however, possesses all the flaws of any Point-and-click game. Though this one does indeed try some interesting changes to the formula.\nVirtually every point-and-click adventure game that requires you to combine collected items to solve puzzles becomes an infuriating quagmire; unless you happen to find the exact combination, in the exact order, that the Developers designed, you cannot progress--regardless of whether or not your idea could work.\nAdd to that the fact that you almost need to be able to read the Developers minds in order to solve many of them, and the game quickly becomes a matter of alternating between pulling teeth and finding a needle in a haystack.\n\nStill, the plot alone can carry you through the whole game. There are a surprising amount of subtle and charming jokes, which are delivered quite well (If the main character cannot manage to find his success, he can always fall back on becoming a highly-skilled plumber with a charming Italian accent. And we all know how successful those can be).\n\nYou have to use a walkthrough to be able to really enjoy the game; which is the strongest mark against it.\nBut this game is deffintely worth it's cost.\n\nThe ending in particular is incredibly satisfying, and leaves just enough open ends to tease any number of sequels.\nI greatly hope to see some, some day.","March 14","true","11.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Puzzles were challenging but didn't suffer from horrendous leaps of logic only seen by a developer. Voice acting very good. Would rate 8/10.\n\n\n\n\nVery hard to think of any let-downs. Possibly the card-game minigame which is downright strange and tacked on. Most of the achievements are based around hidden object puzzles. The extra content is nice but searching the screen for stickers and a slightly blue pixel that could represent a dew drop is not my idea of fun. Further while I appreciate the immersion by having audio-books about the world available and collectable the stories are somewhat twee and have only a superficial linking to the game story as a whole.","December 31, 2014","true","14.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

There are several things I DO like about it, but, imo, they do not adequately compensate for this game's shortcomings.\n\nThe art and music of this game are wonderful, and I do not use that word lightly. The art style is one that draws your eye to every superb little detail. The music too is well-crafted, perfectly suiting the atmosphere of the game. The characters, with the sad exception of the irritating and monotonous protagonist Jerry, are delightful, delivering funny and engaging dialogue with tremendous voice acting.\n\nHowever, the most important part of any game that has puzzles is that the puzzles are fun and challenging, without being overly difficult or convoluted; this game's puzzles fail on all these points. The puzzles depend on you clicking on everything in the game world, to make sure you have all the necessary items. Then, if you cannot deduce the often absurdly specific solution to a problem, you have to resort to trying every possible solution. Compounding this problem is Jerry, repeating himself every time you get something wrong, and it gets annoying VERY quickly. All in all, the needless complexity and ridiculousness of the puzzles means that they are an unpleasant distraction from an otherwise very enjoyable game.\n\nI feel, with this game's strengths and weaknesses, that this game would have suited the visual novel medium better, so the characters, music and art could have more room to express themselves.\n\nIf you are a veteran point-and-click player who's used to these sort of poorly designed puzzles, then by all means pick the game up. Otherwise, I would suggest that the best way to experience The Night of the Rabbit would be to watch a playthrough on YouTube.","June 25, 2015","false","2.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/b-rom/recommended/230820/","b-rom","b-rom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/b-rom/","477 products in account","This game was a delight to play.  I'm glad I had some free time to dedicate to it because I was able to wrap myself up in it like a warm blanket and experience the whole thing.\n\nThe story is a charming combination of Wind in the Willows and Harry Potter, with some Winnie the Pooh mixed in for good measure.  I enjoyed all the characters, and I found the voice acting to be quite decent.  The sound track is excellent, and being as it's available as a part of one of the packages, I recommend buying that package.\n\nThe puzzles are about the only thing that I have any complaints about, which is a problem because the puzzles represent the bulk of the gameplay.  The puzzles were for the most part quite good, with solutions that made sense in retrospect (and usually in prospect too).  Sometimes though the puzzles would be constructed using an object or an ability you have in a way that you hadn't before, or after a period of time that you weren't thinking about it anymore.  And there is such a vast quantity of things to try, and people to try them on, that I needed to resort to a guide on multiple occasions.  That got frustrating.  The game has a hint system, the first spell you learn in fact, but it is the most useless thing I've ever seen.  I can't say that having the hint tool was ever any better then not having it would have been.\n\nTo be constructive, I would have liked to see a bit more contextual hint system.  It could have been, they built it as a spell you can cast.  If they had just made it a spell that you could cast at specific things, it would have allowed for a hint system that gave you information directly related to what is currently obstructing you.  As it is, looking things up in guides is far from perfect.  It's easy to read something you don't want to, and all to often all I needed was a nudge in the right direction, not a detailed explanation of every step.\n\nThere are other little things, like the story pacing is a bit off.  There were some funny bugs from time to time.  Things like once I returned to an area I didn't need to return to, and found an oject's name having changed to "object105_txt" or something similar.  Or another time, similarly when returning to a location I didn't actually need to be in, the main character triggered dialog, but no sound played.  So he just stood there talking silently for about twenty seconds.  The bulk of these bugs seemed to crop up in the final chapters of the game, so I have to wonder if the game was built chronologically and got a bit rushed near the end.\n\nAll in all, a solid game and one that I heartily endorse.","April 15, 2014","true","29.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The use of color and shading really brings out the atmosphere. This is also true for the music, really adds the touch to each of the places you will encounter through the game. Character design is also wonderful, and the character voice truly displays the character personalities.\n\nClassic puzzle solving.\nVery classic mechanism. Talking to NPC and bring items to them. The item collecting, combining and utilizing are all the components I enjoy about this type of adventure game. Although I will say some of the puzzles and item combinations are not as intuitive as it could be. Some item usage are rather a stretch. There is a help mechanism in the game the player can utilize, but I have to say it is rather useless. The help mechanism only continuously repeats the general goal of the section of the game you are on, it does not provide small clues to the smaller parts of the puzzle. The journal is more helpful in every way, although it does not provide hints, but it does keep track what you have to do. But this is a puzzle solving game, it would take away all the fun if the puzzle was too simple.\n\nInteresting story.\nThe story isn't just about a boy with a dream, it has a lot more just than that. But it is hard to speak about how I like the story without spoiling a big part of it, so I guess I won't be talking too much about it. There are a lot that lies behind Jeremy's adventure. The people of Mousewood, the story of the Treewalkers, all the environment and the people of the other worlds. I feel like there are a lot more the game could have emphasized on, but the game was too short to cover everyone's story. I do hope there will be a sequel or maybe DLC to bring out the others' story.\n\nThe in game small game, item and achievement collections are great touches to the game itself. Adds a lot more to the game itself. Overall, this is a great point-and-click adventure game, and I would be totally excited for more stories.","May 2, 2015","true","12.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So, become the magician you always wanted to be and help everyone with your most powerful weapon - your cunningness.","September 10, 2015","true","10.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Where this game falls apart is like the other games this company makes - it's the "I want to throw my computer out the window" difficulty of the puzzles.  This is the second game that I've played by this company (have them all thanks to a bundle deal) and I really wish they would figure out how to help players along with regards to their puzzles.  They are often vague and little help is offered in game by the environment or other characters.  Nobody should have to result to written or video walk through guides to get through a good point and click game (although this one has been a bit easier than Deponia).  For that reason and that reason only, I'm not recommending the game since there is no "neutral" option.  If you don't mind having to consult outside help to progress through the game, give it a try.","December 2, 2015","false","11.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spencicles/recommended/230820/","Spencicles","Trip Fisk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spencicles/","338 products in account","The Night of the Rabbit is a point and click adventure. Point and clicks are not complex games. As such, there are only 2 major categories that define whether or not a game of this genre is any good.\n\n1: a BAD point and click will leave you playing an unwinnable game whether it be because you didn't grab that super important, obscure, hidden intentionally, very easy to miss item that you can't go back and get, or you said or did something that at the time seemed completely innocent but wasn't and wound up screwing you over hard core. Then you're stuck and can't progress anymore or are stuck playing for the bad ending.\n\nFortunately I can say The Night of the Rabbit is not a BAD point and click. Every now and then you'll get stuck not knowing what to do because it would never occur to you to use a grappling hook to slice a piece of cheese off what looks like background decoration. That, as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as is sounds, is normal play for a point and click. The key detail is you're never prevented from going back and doing it and being forced to replay the game from start.\n\n2: a point and click is only as good as the story its telling....\n\nIs The Night of the Rabbit's story good?\n\nWell. There's something called sub-text. Sub-text is the odd yet sensible meaning hidden behind the surface of the normal story. Normally its only hinted at through symbolic references whether that be visual, reference, or word choice. Like that movie Avatar with people reading into it too much saying the movie is actually about American tribal Indians vs. evil white people.\n\nSo what is the story The Night of the Rabbit telling? Well it begins, as fairy tales usually do, with a young child going off into the forest to fetch berries for his mother. As he travels deeper and deeper into the darkening woods, he's tempted by a creature known for living in the world beneath our feet (the underworld) and for the long pointy structures on its head. And what is he tempting the innocent impressionable child with?\n\nMagic... Adventure...\n\nThat, my friends, is what the BLIBBLE calls TEH DEBBLE!\n\nSo of course, the child being naive, becomes abducted by the liar. And what happens next? You're taken to another world filled with all kinds of critters who have risen up to overthrow and take the place of their human overlords. And they speak human! I met creatures in the wild! They speak in squeaks and monkey noises! Having them speak human is EVYL UNNATURAL and UNGAWDLEE!\n\nSo immediately TEH DEBBIL wants you to prepare a party for all his talking animal friends. What are you tasked with? Getting what they love to drink most. PURPLE DRANK! And who makes that? Three grown ♥♥♥ men who live and sleep together! IMMOREL! Who work at night. Moonshiners working under the protection of the dark lord! EEVL MONSTARS! Then TEH DEBBIL buggers off to hang out with his hippy dealer friend (who is crazy because its revealed he's cuckoo in the head) and leaves you doing all the hard work as he plays puff puff pass. AWL LAWDY ALMARTY dat guy GOT NO SHAYME!\n\nAnd as you do this one single thing, you witness the poor young kid you're playing as taken to another world by a little green man; a disgusting foulmouthed creature who wears an enormous hat to make up for the miniscule size of his unmentionables. This poor young kid is also sent to Japanese Hell to be seduced by fox demons. Meanwhile, while the child is being distracted by this wild goose chase, shape changing lizard men are invading and conquring the world. Just as you believe the youth is stranded in a wintry prison forever, he is saved by the grace of the WON TROO LARD by worshipping him through the celebration of Christmas.\n\nThis all leads up to the final stretch which bears many parallels to old myth regarding father issues. Cronus overthrowing his father Uranus. Cronus being overthrown by his own son Zeus. And... A decietful spirit guide who can travel between worlds and raises a child in his own image to overthrow a corrupt all powerful figure who compulsively keeps leaving his annoying brainwashing literature all over the place.\n\nAfter having said all that, would you RISK YOUR VERY SOUL and THE SOULS OF YOUR LOVED ONES by falling prey to the whiles of the DARK LORD and subjecting yourself to a STORY OF THE NIGHT (the environment of the EVILE LARD OF DARKNESS) throwing DANGERS of IMAGINATION and MAGIC in your face tempting you with LIES?? When you should be going to SCHOOL!\n\nWOULD YOU?\n\nWOULD YOU?\n\nWOULD YOU?!?\n\nWOULD YOU????!?!??!???!?!?1","August 12, 2014","true","16.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The art (both audio and visual) were absolutely beautiful and played off of one another very well to help create a mood and atmosphere relative to the plot. The characters were lovable and relatable, and the plot was mostly well done in its creation. The mini game, Quartets, was another fun way to pass the time if you didn't particularly feel like going on with the main game itselfl.\n\nUnfortunately, that's about all that's positive to say about The Night of the Rabbit. I've enjoyed point-and-click puzzle-based games for nearly ten years, but the puzzles in this game were nearly impossible to figure out on your own. I ended up looking up close to half of the game just trying to progress. A lot of the stuff I did get were from the very vague clues that I was actually able to understand, or just from randomly clicking on things in the hopes that it would either work or give a clue clear enough that I would be able to figure out the missing elements. While the daytime/nighttime game mechanic was really, really cool, it also made for more complexity. Some actions are only able to be performed at night, and some of those weren't even made possible until a puzzle during the day was solved. It created a bit of an issue for me, trying to solve two puzzles at once in two completely separate areas. In addition, the ending of the story was incredibly anticlimatic. I don't want to spoil anything for those who still want to buy the game, but after all the puzzles that I had seen and after all of the involvement in the story, I expected something a bit more satisfying. It felt a bit like being cheated; the end had potential but fell very, very flat.\n\nIn the end, I don't think I'd recommend the game, or at least not at its full price. I was lucky enough to catch it while it was on sale, but for all the unsatisfaction of the ending and the frustration of having to look up a walkthrough every twenty minutes, I'm not sure it's worth the full $20.","September 27, 2015","false","24.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198156052144/recommended/230820/","76561198156052144","Anthony S.","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198156052144/","26 products in account","SPOILER ALERT... I'll start off by saying this game does a few things very well.\n\n1. Music - It's beautiful, and it fits very well with the graphics and atmosphere of the game. I really love it.\n2. Graphics/Art style/Atmosphere - Also beautiful. Everything looks so polished, vibrant and colorful. The game looks great. It feels like a fairy tale.\n\nBut when it comes to things I like about this game, that's where it ends. The story is... well, here... A boy wants to be a magician. So a letter comes flying out of the sky, right into his mailbox. It has directions on it in the form of a poem. The boy follows the directions, and a magic box appears with a rabbit that tells the boy that he'll be his apprentice, and go on an adventure, yada yada yada... That's it. The boy gets to go on an adventure and be a magician. I don't see how that's an intriguing story, but I let it slide because I thought the other things might make up for it, and maybe it'll get more interesting the farther I go. Now, I should say, I didn't finish the game. Maybe it does get more interesting... I'll never know. And I don't really care, to be honest. But let's talk about the one thing that caused me to stop playing this game... The puzzles.\n\nThe top reviews of this game didn't have many positive things to say about the puzzles, although they absolutely loved everything else. I, for one, thought the puzzles ruined the entire game. One very positive review calls the puzzles "brain-scratching"... As if that's a good thing. Normally, it would be a good thing. But in this case, it's not. I'd also describe the puzzles in this game as "brain-scratching"... As in, I'm scratching my head so hard that I actually start to touch my brain after reading a walkthrough and asking myself how other human beings thought that this would make sense.\n\nThe very first "puzzle" of the game is using a stick, which looks the same size of a stick you would use to roast a marshmallow, to completely remove a thorny bush so that you can gain access to berries your mother asked you to pick. I felt that it didn't really make sense. The bush completely disappeared after wacking it with a stick. That just seems weird to me. At first, I didn't have a big problem with it, but now that I know what the rest of the puzzles are like... I do. It does make sense somewhat. People clear bushes and leaves out of their path while walking by using sticks. But it's just not something you'd think to do, even though, via luck, I did.\n\nThe next puzzle was the one involving the letter. The letter gives you directions in the form of a poem. So the game helps you with this puzzle. Cryptic, but it's help nonetheless. The solution for the puzzle is one of the most bizarre things I've seen in a game. You find an empty pop can. You're supposed to put 3 acorns... smashed chalk (powder)... a piece of tree bark... and a carrot... IN THE POP CAN. Now, let just me say, the letter gives you hints, so it's not completely random. If you played the game, you'd understand. But the puzzle still makes absolutely no sense. You know how the top of pop cans look, right? You could barely fit your tongue in the hole used to drink from it. The game expects you to know to put a carrot... A CARROT. Not a mini carrot. A fat, large carrot... into the pop can. Not to mention a piece of tree bark, which also looks very large. And they're in there together. It's just so illogical and stupid that I almost lost hope for the game right there... and it's nearly the beginning of the game. It's not like you're a magician at that point. You're a kid. And even if you WERE a magician, the story/magic being involved should not eliminate logic from the puzzles. Nothing should. Those things DO NOT fit inside a tiny pop can.\n\nThere's a puzzle later on involving a rake and a leprechaun. You need to make the leprechaun step on the rake and smash his own face. He moves to different locations, and you basically have to follow him until he goes to this clover leaf where he gains his powers from... he hops around on it, and you need to put the rake there before he hops around on it. It makes sense, but it's just not something you'd think to do. And that's a theme with a lot of the puzzles. Trial and error. "I guess that makes sense, but nobody would ever think to do that."\n\nThere was a puzzle with a little mouse not letting you go to a new area unless you give money, although when you talk to him, he talks about wanting something sweet and surgary. In another area of the game, there's an empty bee hive, and you have a sugar free lollipop in your inventory. He doesn't accept the lollipop because it's sugar free. So you go to the bee hive and put honey on it. Then he accepts it, and lets you by. That makes sense. That was the only moment in the game where I actually thought the puzzle made perfect sense, and that it's something that people would think to do because it's logical.\n\nWhen you talk to the little mouse, he mentions another character in the game is his baby sitter. That's all he mentions. This character in the game is his baby sitter. In your inventory, you have an ad for violin lessons. It's just something you have, among the other billion things you have in there. That's another problem with the game. Inventory. You have a ton of crap in there. And you don't want to use all your items on different things because you, for the most part, get the same dialogue every time, and it's just an annoying thing to do. It's not fun. But anyway... You need to give the ad for violin lessons to her. Later on, you need to get to another area, and the little mouse is back. This time, he wants money. Now, I looked at a walkthrough, so I would have never known to give his baby sitter the ad for violin lessons, but imagine if you didn't know to do that. You would be stuck. WHY would she want that? NOTHING implies that you would have to give her that. She comes in, and says "look at this ad for violin lessons, you could be a star, you're the perfect mouse" or something like that, and the little mouse leaves with her, allowing you to go by. It's just... like... why? WHY would anybody think to do that? Unless you use every item in your inventory on everything. At the time, I had 19 items in my inventory, so I wasn't going to do that. Even in games where I don't have a lot of things in my inventory, I try my best not to use items on everything just because. I want to think about it, understand why I'm doing it, and then do it. It needs to make sense. And that doesn't. It makes absolutely no sense. Why would she want that? Why would you have to give that to her?\n\nANOTHER PART. You're asked to find an anchor, a rudder, and to remove a giant catfish that's blocking your way. Alright. Fine. Anchor... You use a grappling hook. I GUESS that makes sense, it's for a leafy boat that isn't an actual boat, it's not very heavy, so that's fine. Then you use a spoon as a rudder. A spoon. When you pick up (or find) the spoon, it's very large... but in your inventory, it looks small. Like a regular spoon. Large or small, it barely makes sense as a rudder, but fine. Then, to get rid of the giant catfish... you use... valerian drops. That's when I had enough. Why on earth would you use drops used as a sleeping aid on a giant catfish blocking your way? WHY WOULD ANYBODY DO THAT?! ... It makes NO sense. You only use a few drops anyway, and the river current is flowing rapidly... WHY WOULD THAT MAKE THE CATFISH GO AWAY?! EVEN IF HE FALLS ASLEEP. IT MAKES NO SENSE.\n\nI mean, I could go on. There are little things. Sometimes, while Jerry (main character) is talking, the audio cuts off before he could finish the final word of his dialogue.\n\nBottom line: I just don't see how you could enjoy this game unless you don't mind looking at walkthroughs constantly or using every item in your inventory on everything. That's just not a fun gaming experience for me.","April 5, 2015","false","5.6"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","16","33","0","0"

These adventure games often make me love what they do, but at times their games can be a bit too tough for me and I got through this one alright. It wasn't too difficult, but like all of them it has a really interesting story.\n\nThe kids voice is not as annoying as the kid's from Whispered Word, but this one is tolerable. There are a lot of interesting ideas  here with how trees can be used to travel to new worlds if their roots have gone so deep that they dip into dreams and a interesting metaphisical world to come out of it too.\n\nThe characters are bright and colourful and sure to leave an impression on anyone who plays this. If you're a fan of their stuff (Deponia, The Whispered Word, Edna and Harvey) you'll certainly enjoy this. If this is the first game of there's you are considering buying, I'd certainly suggest you get this game if you're looking for a much more likable protagonist than Rufus from Deponia and you want to try out a quite imaginative adventure game too.","March 2, 2014","true","18.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But then, I can't imagine anyone in that age range having the sheer amount of patience that this game requires you to have in order to complete it.\n\nThe game often has to simply... take breaks, halting all progress in order to stop and explain to you what's going on. If I'd written the review right after completing it, rather than giving it some time to cool off, my review would likely have just been the words "SHOW, DON'T TELL" over and over again. The fact that a point-and-click adventure game has to rely on heavy narration to convey its plot seems extremely poorly exectued. Secrets in the game are completely pointless - Collecting all the dewdrops reveals a 'secret' that's completely meaningless until it's explained to you at the end of the game - which was five minutes away anyway.\n\nThe art is good, and the story CONCEPT is great, but the execution comes off more like a Putt-Putt or Feddie Fish game due to its hamfisted storytelling and constant reliance on the main character trying to be cute/funny. After having to listen to a Dwarf sneeze and cough for five minutes in unskippable dialog, you'll understand what I mean.","September 23, 2015","false","8.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

In fact, I couldn't even be bothered to try to finish it. I didn't really like the two Dark Eye games either (Chains of Satinav and Memoria), but at least they held a certain amount of interest value, enough for me to see them through. All the others I really loved, even 1954 Alcatraz.\n\nThis game is just horribly boring. The kid you're playing never gets to the point, and the rabbit he's following is even worse; even when he says "we must hurry", he spends another 30 seconds on a few more useless comments. In addition, the game even lags (on a GTX 970), the music is horrible and the brightness/contrasts too high (my eyes hurt after playing it for 45 minutes).

Terribly, horrendously slow. Glacially slow.  Heaven help anyone who accidentally clicks too many times and restarts a dialogue with someone to whom you've just finished talking. Perhaps it is my fault for choosing a point & click adventure as I know they're typically a lazier pace focused on story...and perhaps the story in this game is wonderful.

I'd give it it try, no matter how illogical they were if not for the godawful boring dialogue that makes me want to bang my head over the keyboard.\n\nAlso there are achievements that require you to collect all the crap scattered around the game, uber-hidden in super detailed backgrounds. Yaaay, a pixel hunt. And then, reading the forums looking for fellow haters, I found out that one of the crap things is located in the prologue (tutorial) of the game.

After finishing the Deponia Triology along with Edna & Harvey, I expected a lot from this. But sadly I was wrong. You get to play this 10 year old (or 8?) kid who is kind of stupid. No offense, I'm just being honest. He always asks the stupidest questions. I mean, I expect that from a little kid but I don't think it kind of makes sense considering his role in the game. Not to mention the other characters are also very childish and annoying.\n\nAnd some of the puzzles are really impossible to solve without a walkthrough. After I read the walkthrough, I was always like "Really? Is this a joke?" No way a person would think of doing that. And the card game? It was definitely one of the most annoying things in this game. Even though I memorized the card the opponent picked out and chose it when it was my turn, it turns out he doesn't have that card. But he just got it from me...\n\nI won't recommend the game because it just wasn't a nice experience overall. It was boring most of the times, and also annoying.

There are some very annoying things about the pacing of the conversations and the main character's personality but it is a really charming world with a good story! I love Daedalic for their enviroments, the cosy and magical atmosphere, interesting worlds and the puzzeling. The mechanics were interesting but unexploited, the story somewhat lacked a connection to the main character. Even if the story was very nice, in the end it sort of lost its meaning.  However, if you like magic and beautiful fairytale-like graphics, this is a game for you.\n\nAnd now for the long review;\n\n\n\n\nSPOILER WARNING\n\n\n\n\nTHOUGHTS ON THE STORY\nI must say the story, nay, the main character was a little too heroic for my taste! The story is actually very nice, I would say it is about following your dreams even if critizised by others (which feels very relevant for those working in the game industry - atleast where I'm from). Removing the characters personality from the story I actually appriciated it a lot, the pacing was good, the game opened up successivly revealing new areas with new characters and new quests. I never found the story frustrating or the pacing irritating apart from maybe the end with the stage and everything, the finale.\nI did like the twist in the end that sort of turned out not to be a twist at all (?) lol, but it felt a little far-fetched, rather wishing to make a point than actually making it. In the end the good guy turns out to be a bad guy, who turns out to be a good guy? ... So I guess the fable-side to this story is not to believe someone is evil only because people say so, and its' never too late to make things right.\n\nAs mentioned above there was a lot of praising of the main character, Jerry, (from others as well as himself, especially from all the female characters who NATURALLY were all in love with him or called him sweetiepie as they watched the children, baked cookies or waited for that new fashionable purse) which really got on my nerves, apart from the grumpy garden owner and the gome maybe (yay for them!). Jerry didn't really feel like he had much character development through the story - he did doubt his wishes to become a magician in the beginning, but not enough to feel like a change in character as the story developed. Very early on he seemed over-confident in himself and it did not really feel like he went though a struggle.\n\nEven though there were some ties in the story to Jerry's past (his father) it still felt very vague and not really reason enough for me to care. However, when I realised Jerry had lost so many years of his life and his mother had been waiting for him I did feel touched and was motivated to change it back. For me that was a big motivator along with the wish to explore and the will to adventure. However, it may just be that his personality irritated me so much that I cannot write much positive stuff in this section, haha. I'm still not sure what Jerry ought to have learned from this, and even if he learned that he CAN be a magician for a living, or something, I never found out which was slightly disappointing.\nAlso, sometimes it felt like the characters took a little bit too much of the game - in many conversations there were a lot of small-talk that wasn't really related to the story and didn't really fit into the character's personality. Simply sillyness, which can sometimes be fun, but combined with the odd pacing in the conversations (weird pauses and so) it made me very frustrated. The end was also a little bit caotic, that the bad guy was evil, but then only now and not in the past, but then then that scene in the end where the recent and evil version of the evil person who-shall-not-be-named helped Jerry get back... At first I thought that Jerry was the apprentice that turned evil and that he was Zaroff, and that he was brought back in time to see all this to ultimately give up his magical powers to prevent it from happening or something.. just for a brief moment. I was slighly disappointed when that wasn't the case lol.\n\nGraphically it really felt like the game changed in time. As the player got further and further away from Mousewood the graphics gets darker, with the Dwarfs homes and the Moths, and to the west the forest. Also the different worlds in which Jerry found the different spells grew darker, and the growing threat from the Lizards was very nicely portraid.\n\nTHOUGHTS ON THE MECHANICS\nThe game mechanics progress nicely along with the story as the player learns new spells which kept me interested. I did not expect any of the mechanics of the different spells and I must say they feel very unique. It was also combined with several mini-quests (collecting stickers, raindrops and what not) which was a very nice detail for giving the player some extra feeling of progression and raising atleast my awareness.\nI felt a little dissapointed that the spells were used to little when the focus was so much on magic otherwise. Much of the game consists of finding, combining and using things to get new things to take you to new places like in Deponia, though slightly less difficult. In comparison to Deponia there were alot of items that stayed with the player through the whole game, and I must say I had a little "Aha!" When I realized I was going to make another magical circle in the end. The was also alot more centered around Mouseville compared to Deponia which was much more stretched out over different scenes and places, so Night of the Rabbit felt much more compact and interesting to me. The world changed more and as a player I was able to interact with it much more over time, strengthening the bond to the world and its inhabitants.\n\nSUM OF THE CARDEMUM\nIn the end I found myself really wishing for the world which Jerry originally came from to be changed, for me to be able to use the spells I learned to see the world in a different way, maybe that the rocks that once were quiet really weren't and that I could use fox-cunning to create illusions to amuse a child or something to prove that Jerry will continue to use his magic in this world too, and ultimately becoming a Wizard in this world too. Too see that all this affected him somehow. That is what I lacked in the end.","January 29, 2015","true","17.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is fully voiced, and includes beautiful art, and an amazing soundtrack brings the game to life in a delightfully unique way.  The gameplay itself is based around large scale logic puzzles, often involving many steps, each with a puzzle all their own. (A puzzleception if you will.) While often difficult, the gameplay can be quite relaxing. Overall this game was well worth what I paid, and probably more. It left me on the verge of tears, and I loved every second.\n\nStory: 10/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nAesthetics:10/10\n","January 15, 2015","true","20.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nice story, setting and good voice-acting. Pacing problems, low puzzle variety, relatively tame humor and wasted opportunities prevents the game from being great. Still very much recommended, especially at a sale.\n\nFull review: You play as Jeremiah Hazelnut, a young boy dreaming of becoming a wizard. When contacted by the mysterious Marque de Hotto, you jump at the chance to travel to mysterious places and learn magic. The story is overall good with a nice setting and some interesting characters. It seems to be aimed at a younger audience than me, however, with relatively toothless humor and tame villains. There are some darker parts to the game, but nothing worse than seen similar modern fairy tales for kids. The environmental message is nice, but perhaps a bit ham-fistedly told.\n\nOne problem is the pacing, which is a bit off. This game loves to hear itself talk to the point of overshadowing the gameplay. The endless exposition by the Marque at the early stages of the game bored my girlfriend to tears and I had to continue on my own. This continues to some degree throughout the game with dialogue being repeated a lot and taking just a little too long to skip when you are trying to see if a character has something new to say. An especially atrocious example of time-wasting is the fast-travel system which takes so much time to use it is generally more efficient just to double-click yourself scene by scene until you get where you want to go.\n\nThe puzzles are entirely item-based so if you’re looking for more puzzle-variety you’re not going to find it here. Even the spells you learn are essentially items and do not work together in any interesting ways. An example of wasted potential. As they are, the puzzles are mostly logical, but suffer from the same problems as other item based puzzle games. Additionally there are loads of red herrings in the game, with objects having no function, no function until much later in the game or having multiple interactive areas (for example tree and hole in the tree). This can lead to some frustration, especially if you’ve tried the item on the hole in the tree, but were given no indication that you were supposed to use it on the tree instead. There is usually no guidance or humor offered by the protagonist from using the wrong items either which is a shame.\n\nTo give some variety there are a fair bit of collectables, as well as a mini-card game and some additional audio books to listen to. Personally I found both the card-game and audio books rather dull, but it’s nice that they are there.\n\nI mostly enjoyed my time with The Night of the Rabbit, but I could not shake the feeling there was a great deal of wasted potential. Perhaps it was because I’m not the age group it is aimed for, but the setting is so nice and some of the characters so interesting… it just seems like they could have done something more with it. It’s all very… tame. However, it is still a good game even if it is not great. So I do recommend it, but personally I would not buy it at full price (20 Euro atm).","November 30, 2014","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is awesome. I have really enjoyed following the main character, Jerry, and learning who the other characters are. The one down side that I feel there is to this game is some of the hints seem a little too vegue, or some of the points it seems as if there are not hints at all.

There were a couple times when I wanted to punch the 'puzzle' designers in the face. Or stick them in a locked room with a handful of random objects and a short, obnoxious, repeating soundbyte. On the whole not horrible though, averaged about 1 'hint' for every hour of play.\n\nThe story is what kept me going but I had to roll my eyes at the ending for a few reasons. Through the game they were pretty good about layering in hints as to certain things so you would get a sense of what was going on. However at the end of the game the entire plot is dumped on you in a long cutscene. Why include all those hints if you didn't want us to pick up on them? Additionally while I do like the characters and understand why the entire series would be broken up I feel that much more of the arc could be covered in a single game if every trivial step wasn't so obscenely convoluted. The last stinger actually made me excited and want to play the next game though, I will certainly consider picking it up when it goes on sale.","December 8, 2014","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphically it is beatiful, even when chugging along on my outdated gaming rig. Sound quality and voice acting was also well done.\n\nIt isn't without it's flaws. The subplot of the story about the intrusiveness of humans on an animal's world is to be expected in a game primaryilly set in a town of talking forest animals, but it reached a point where it was too blunt in your face for even my very high suspension of disblief at one critical moment. Also, while the sound and audio quality were wonderful, it did as mentioned "chug along" on my outdated gaming rig leaving me uncetain on whether the quality was an issue of my system or on polish of certain sections of the game.\n\nWith that said I finished the game, outdated gaming rig nonwithstanding, and would certainly recommend the story to anyone who once enjoyed the old point and click adventures from the playstation; it's a wonderful story, and the optional "collectables" gives my OCD a nice rewarding scritch. Anyone wanting to get the game for their children is encouraged to play through it first themselves; not only do I believe anyone would enjoy this story, but what is appropirate for your children is a judgement call you should make yourself and not rely entirely on a thirty something single man behind the computer.","July 12, 2014","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Night of the Rabbit has a beautiful art style that is very evocative of childhood (think Winnie the Pooh) yet is far from childish. It also has a gorgeous soundtrack (do not miss out on this!). If you have children, Night of the Rabbit is certainly Daedalic's most child-friendly title (as opposed to Deponia, which is a terrific game but overflowing with innuendo)--no bad language, no innuendo, relatively straightforward puzzles. I feel that Night of the Rabbit has three weaknesses, however: its story is somewhat predictable (not necessarily in a bad way, but many of Daedalic's titles such as Deponia or The Whispered World have very surprising endings), it gets a little preachy with its environmental message (not that the message is bad, but no one appreciates being clubbed over the head with it), and the idea of using magic was cool but dramatically underutilized. Nevertheless, I recommend Night of the Rabbit simply to enjoy the beautiful art and music--it really is an experience.","July 2, 2014","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The storytelling, aesthetics, and puzzle-centric gameplay are all somewhere between solid and outstanding. In all, it's like playing through a really good children's book, complete with lovable characters, sinister villains, and some surprisingly complex moral lessons.\n\nRight off the bat, when you start playing this game, you will notice one of the game's biggest strengths--the lovely visuals. The Night of the Rabbit is simply beautiful. And even though each screen features a tremendous amount of detail, the game's various areas never seem cluttered. Important points of interest, such as items to pick up and tools to manipulate, are subtly and effectively foregrounded so that most (but not all) will draw your notice quickly as you explore new places.\n\nThe gorgeous environments go a long way toward shaping this game's effective atmosphere, as does its stellar music. Just listen to the title music at some point--it's lovely, evocative, and downright moving. Regardless of where you are in the game, you will be tempted to slow down and simply look and listen. The orchestrations usually focus on one or two instruments (such as fiddle, flute, or xylophone), and the music definitely carries a live-recorded vibe.\n\nBut while the game's visuals and atmosphere might be impressive, the game's single greatest strength is in its splendid cast of characters. It's hard to describe, but each and every character truly belongs in this game. Many of the characters can come off as a little one-dimensional at first, but as the game goes on, those same characters receive much greater depth and complexity in most cases (such as Steinberg the dwarf, the Little Man in the Green Hat, and the ornery hare patriarch). The game's cast of rounded, interesting characters even extends to its main villains and heroes. Jerry Hazelnut is not a simple character a la Link from the old Legend of Zelda games. And neither is his mentor, the Marquis de Hoto (and title rabbit)--or his eventual enemies.\n\nThe game also features excellent voice acting, which helps deepen the portrayal of the broad and varied cast of characters. Although there are a few oddly read lines here and there, and the subtitle text sometimes differs slightly from the spoken dialogue, the voice acting in this game is really well done overall. The voices for the different characters are as unique and interesting as they are, and the voices blend well into the fabric of the game's world and sense of storytelling. I can't imagine playing this game without listening to the characters' voices.\n\nNo point-and-click adventure can succeed without a top-shelf story, and The Night of the Rabbit definitely delivers the goods in this area. The story is rich and interesting, although the overarching plot can get a little confusing at times. This is one of those games that constantly promises that "all will be explained in time," and while most of the game's action doesn't depend on the purposefully obscure plotlines for meaning, it can still seem a little overbearing to go through so much of the game without understanding what is happening on a meta level. You don't even get a clear sense of who the bad guys are or might be until about halfway through the game.\n\nIn addition, the game is a little heavy on the front and back ends. There are too many layers of framing around the game in the beginning, and while the game does a nice job of integrating its tutorial so that it doesn't seem completely like a pointless exercise, you will wish the game would just step aside and let you play at first. The game's ending, too, features a lot of text and a lot of story exposition--mostly because the makers of the game save so much of the villains' backstory and motivation for the final sequences.\n\nNevertheless, The Night of the Rabbit's story somehow manages to live up to its lofty promises. By the end of the game, you really do feel as though you understand all the vagueries the game plagued you with earlier. The roles of the mysterious characters, the identity and purpose of the villains, and your role in bringing a peaceful resolution all come clearly into light at the game's conclusion. That said, I'd say the story's greatest strength is that it doesn't rap up every loose end or explain away every detail. Some characters who are in need at the game's outset are still in need at the game's end. Your actions don't solve every single problem in the game's world--they just show how so many problems can be dealt with through the power of community, friendship, and selflessness.\n\nAs a point-and-click adventure, this game requires a methodical approach. If you look everywhere and pay close attention to the game's visual details and textual clues, you can probably progress pretty smoothly. Most of the game's puzzles are highly intuitive, if you can remember which items you have and what the game's context clues suggested those items might be used for. The few times I checked a walkthrough for help, it always turned out that I was on the right track, and it was just the method I was messing up. That is a slight problem though--sometimes you can't easily figure out how to complete puzzles even though you know you're holding the right materials. A few puzzles are a little finicky or require an unintuitive arrangement of steps to complete.\n\nFurthermore, the game's richest gameplay segments come at the beginning and middle. As the game goes on, and you finish exploring the core areas of the world, the game becomes much more linear. Once you reach the point where the game is introducing one new area at a time, you are likely done with the game's most interesting puzzles. Still, the end game's new areas and characters are just as fascinating as those from earlier in the game--and sometimes even more so.\n\nThe gameplay also struggles with some pacing issues. Jerry just kind of meanders from place to place regardless of plot context, and there are awkwardly long pauses between many lines of dialogue. The farther you get into the game, the more rough-around-the-edges the animations and loaded events (like subtitles/dialogue) get. But overall, if you can adapt to the game's slow-ish pace, your experience will be that much richer for it.\n\nSo yeah, The Night of the Rabbit is essentially an interactive storybook--a good story told by a masterful storyteller. It's lovely, it's deep, and it carries a surprisingly mature message: avoid humanity's darker instincts for selfishness and greed, learn to live peacefully with your friends and neighbors, and nothing is impossible.","December 15, 2014","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

TO THE BOTTOM IF TLDR;\n\nThis is probably the first time i have played a click and go adventure game such as this properly, i knew of the classics as a boy but never actually played them myself.\n\nThe only adventure games i had seriously played until now were of the telltale variety and as much as i adored their stories and characters, i couldn't help but feel they were severely lacking in genuine interactivity outside of choosing dialogue that led to the same conclusion.\n\nIt should be said that these kinds of adventure games had never really appealed to me before so i should thank telltale for igniting that first spark of curiosity, thus began my search for a ''proper'' point and click adventure game.\n\nAfter stumbling across the name Daedalic and sifting through their numerous adventure titles i had finally settled on night of the rabbit, and at first glance it instantly appealed with it's art style and design, it's music and it's mystery and of course the enigmatic rabbit himself the Marqui De Hoto.\n\nI eagerly started the game and was pleasently surprised at how well the game accustomed me (a first time point and click player) to it's mechanics and controls, i was however not so enthralled with the introduction of my player character Jerry Hazelnut.\n\nNow i have no idea if Daedalic intended to make a bland character so the player might more easily project themselves into the world or if they did try their damndest to make an engaging protagonist but i feel they failed on both fronts\n\nJeramiah Hazelnut is hard to feel for, relate to and to like, and his voice actor is the absolute worst.\nAt least the actor is very good at READING his lines, bless him.\n\nI don't entirely hate the character, he does have a few funny lines here or there and some of his dialogue is well written.\nIt is a shame then that his lines are delivered so blandly and more often than not with incorrect pronunciation that he could get tiring and take me out of an otherwise engaging scene with other characters.\n\nSpeaking of other characters, the rest of the woodland cast you encounter are voiced alot better and are eccentric and rather adorable.\nThe game instantly gives off a wind in the willows/winnie the pooh vibe and as such i felt oddly nostalgic as i played, it reminded me of the kinds of shows i watched when i was younger (animals of farthing wood/red wall)\n\nAs for the game mechanics themselves, they're easy to get to grips with and the first few puzzles were quite simple and easy enough to figure out.\nHowever part way through the first act i began running into the trouble of ''rub everything you have on everything till it works!'' something i had heard was an imfamous problem in some adventure games.\n\nNow either i'm as thick as a sack of bricks or you need to be able to read the designers minds in order to solve some logic puzzles, throw in the added problem of having many differant problems to solve at once that give you access to differant items or areas that may be needed for other items or areas and you have the cause of some major pacing issues.\n\nI'm ashamed to admit i needed a walkthrough at least five times and everytime i kicked myself when i discovered the answers, causing such reactions as ''you must be joking!'' or ''how was i supposed to figure that out?!'' the game does not hold your hand and requires some patience, though as frustrating as it got i still felt engaged enough to get through it.\n\nBeing about magic and such i expected the game would be full of it and puzzles to solve accordingly, however what i got by the end was (what i feel) ultamately underplayed.\nToo few puzzles actually involve magic and the spells you do learn are rather underwhelming and a little useless especially the help spell, it only explains where you are in the story and not how to progress.\n\nThe story itself is a rather intrigueing mystery, it has great atmosphere and build up and can get a little emotional sometimes.\nAlthough the game tended to show or mention a few themes or characters then never fleshes them out or leaves them unresolved and certain things really needed more focus.\n\nThe game also has a bunch of unlockables such as movies and quaint mousewood audio books, and collectibles which is novel.\nThere is also a card mini game that can be played with most anyone in the world, it's alright not too bad but not that good either.\n\nAll in all i feel quite strange about this game, i liked it very much so, but i want to like it more.\nI feel the game is complete and satisfactory, but not as much as it could be, it has some interesting ideas and a great story and cast waiting to be expanded.\n\nI think i will wait a while before playing another point and clicker but thanks to night of the rabbit i certainly want to play another one, this game was a whimsicaly frustrating delight that made me feel young then old again.\n\nCons-\n-Dodgy Pacing and story focus\n-Cardboard Protagonist (with even flatter voice over) delivery took me out of some scenes\n-frustrating ''Kick yourself when you realize the answer!'' logic puzzles\n-certain themes, stories or characters being introduced or hinted but not fully realized or resolved\n-useless help spell\n-not enough spells or sensible puzzles that use them\n-The game is a bit on the short side i think\n\nPros-\n-outstanding visuals, animation and appealing design\n-intriguing story and lore\n-quirky, often fun characters\n-fitting sounds and music\n-wreaks of whimsey and atmosphere\n-collectables, unlockable bonuses and an alright card game adds additional replayability\n-Marqui De Hoto ;)","March 20, 2015","true","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found myself going back to the guide to see to the particulars of a task.  (Good luck figuring out how to catch a dandilion seed on your own!)\n\nOver all: I definitely recommend checking it out for the stylized art and plotline.  However, definitely have a walkthrough/guide handy.  If you can, dual screen tag team it with the game on one screen and the guide on the other.

With its beauty, story, and delightful Alice in wonderland feel this game is a win for the whole family.\nI give it a 8/10.","January 10, 2015","true","17.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its characters are likeable, its puzzles challenging, its story captivating, and its atmosphere never fails to draw me into the game.\n\nThe atmosphere of this game get special points from me because it takes me back to when I was a kid running around my backyard or the forest near my parent's house.

The in-game hint system (ask the rabbit for guidance) is unfortunately very weak. It only ever repeats the last thing the rabbit asked you to do. However, the game is very good about giving you audio tips if you are on the right track with solving a puzzle.\n\nIt tells the story of a 12 year old boy who wants to have an adventure in the woods before the school holidays end. He befriends a number of anthropomorphic characters including mice, hares, a frog, and of course, a rabbit. It reminds me favourably of "Simon the Sorceror" with modern graphics, mostly because the protagonist wants to become a magician.\n\nThere is a theme of conservation/saving the environment, but this game is *much* less obnoxious about it than other adventure games I've played.\n\nThe graphics are cute, the music is nice and the characters are fun. There is a lot to like here. Recommended.","March 6","true","19.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It just skipped dialogs mid-sentence without any keypress, and this was a repeating problem, maybe on every fourth to fifth dialog box.\n\nThat quickly turned me off the game, but even without that, my first impression of Night of the Rabbit can be summed up in the word "tedium". Starting with the "tutorial", it was a slow, tedious, and confusing experience, which was kicked into high drive by the aforementioned bug.\n\nAnd "it's for kids" is no excuse, Putt-Putt for example was for kids, and it was anything BUT tedious.

Fans of adventure games like Sam & Max or Secret of Monkey Island will love this fairy tale. You play the part of Jeremy Hazelnut a young boy on his second last day of summer holiday with a homework assignment postponed until the last minute and the chance for adventure dwindling away Jeremy is whisked away by the Marquis De Hoto, a magical rabbit who takes him on as an apprentice.\n\nIn the woodland village of Mousewood (and now a couple of inches tall) Jeremy meets the many furry inhabitants and goes on errands for them while the greater story unfolds. It does get a bit too wordy occasionally but it's still one of the best adventure games I have played.\n\nThe animation is lovely and the locations are whimsical. The voice acting can get a bit stiff but the character design is so cute you might not notice. If you see this game in a store or on Steam then don't hesitate to make a purchase if you are a fan of the genre. I finished the game in about 15 hours but missed 3 of the achievements.

It has its flaws, but I'd recommend it overall, especially (but not exclusively) to younger people. I think the game's ideal audience might be 12 year olds or so, but the young at heart can also enjoy it.\n\nPros:\n+ Great artwork. Not only is it good, it really suits the game and makes it look like illustrations in a storybook--the good kind that you'll always have a soft spot in your heart for\n+ Voice acting is also good, and suits the game well\n+ Overall, most of the point and click puzzles are pretty good. Not too many are nonsensical or overly frustrating--though the in-game "hint" system is awful. You may need to consult a walkthrough a couple of times.\n+ Story and setting are very creative. This game is not your standard genre cliche.\n+ Story is very good and features some nice twists\n\nCons:\n- Game can be a little boring. The game is more charming and imaginative than it is exciting or action-packed\n- Interactions with characters are a bit one-dimensional and at times reminded me of the shallow interactions on a children's TV show. The main story has some depth, but the "everyday" interactions are not very good. There is none of the grittiness behind characters that you see in many games.\n- Pacing of the story is off. The game really drags at spots, and on the other hand huge chunks of story blow past in the ending cutscene. You spend most of the game guessing at what's going on, then everything is revealed all at once.","February 28","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For story sake I'll keep details to a minimum.\n\nA young boy follows through on an extraordinarily good day of his summer vacation.\n\nNow for the negative critisim, alot of the puzzles seem outright far too simple for me, and it also feels as though several are made more complexe than they aught to be. In addition to this, your character will make remarks if you are missing something. Or if it's a bad time to use it. but sometimes all you get is a shrug or just simple "no that won't work" without even the faintest hint as to why it won't. And it has no alternate routes, no puzzle switching between playthroughs and as thus, little to no replay value.\nIn closure, it's a nice little thing to play a once through on a cold day where you just want to wrap up and have some calm entertainment with an imagintive tale.","November 26, 2014","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The in-game hint system (ask the rabbit for guidance) is unfortunately very weak. It only ever repeats the last thing the rabbit asked you to do. However, the game is very good about giving you audio tips if you are on the right track with solving a puzzle.\n\nIt tells the story of a 12 year old boy who wants to have an adventure in the woods before the school holidays end. He befriends a number of anthropomorphic characters including mice, hares, a frog, and of course, a rabbit. It reminds me favourably of "Simon the Sorceror" with modern graphics, mostly because the protagonist wants to become a magician.\n\nThere is a theme of conservation/saving the environment, but this game is *much* less obnoxious about it than other adventure games I've played.\n\nThe graphics are cute, the music is nice and the characters are fun. There is a lot to like here. Recommended.","March 6","true","19.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has its flaws, but I'd recommend it overall, especially (but not exclusively) to younger people. I think the game's ideal audience might be 12 year olds or so, but the young at heart can also enjoy it.\n\nPros:\n+ Great artwork. Not only is it good, it really suits the game and makes it look like illustrations in a storybook--the good kind that you'll always have a soft spot in your heart for\n+ Voice acting is also good, and suits the game well\n+ Overall, most of the point and click puzzles are pretty good. Not too many are nonsensical or overly frustrating--though the in-game "hint" system is awful. You may need to consult a walkthrough a couple of times.\n+ Story and setting are very creative. This game is not your standard genre cliche.\n+ Story is very good and features some nice twists\n\nCons:\n- Game can be a little boring. The game is more charming and imaginative than it is exciting or action-packed\n- Interactions with characters are a bit one-dimensional and at times reminded me of the shallow interactions on a children's TV show. The main story has some depth, but the "everyday" interactions are not very good. There is none of the grittiness behind characters that you see in many games.\n- Pacing of the story is off. The game really drags at spots, and on the other hand huge chunks of story blow past in the ending cutscene. You spend most of the game guessing at what's going on, then everything is revealed all at once.","February 28","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
