Kill Team still has problems but serious problems seem fixed after update.\n(Likes cam angle bug, bad mouse sensitive, etc.)\nI'm glad watch Nomad Games has intention to modify and I hope they fix co-op problem too.\nUpdate makes me feeling better, meanwhile, it means Nomad Games sold beta version of product to full price when I think about it. It's another nasty things.\nSo I still recomand you wait buying and watch the development of 40k: Kill Team.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nWhen I saw Kill Team on steam, I'm really happy. I'm big fan of Warhammer 40k, I have 5000pts(Maybe 6k) Imperial Guard army, playing warhammer fantasy too, have lot of Warhammer game(most of them... you know, shity game), Novels... Trailer seems 'not bad 40k game', I was really happy, and buy 3 Kill Team for gift. Hah, damn you Archrite.

Well... strictly say... better than SoV....\nLocal Co-op? Bull ♥♥♥♥! It doesn't support co-op! It dosen't work! It doesn't! To start Co-op, you need press start button of 2p but in game you can only control 1p. Game option doesn't suport 2p key! Ofcourse, no invite friend option too! You can't invite your friend, both online and offline.\n\nBad optimization is another problem. In game, we control shooting angle by mouse, but can't modify mouse sensitive. Doesn't support wide screen, screen easily change wide to full to wide to full to wide by vaccine or whatever, and steam option cover game screen when press splint button. Game hint doesn't change. For example, It told me 'press LR to use Special Move'. What??? What is LR?? What am I supposed to do??? Bad cam angle is problem too.\n\nIt's not game for PC gamer, I recommand Do Not Buy, if if if yoooou really want play, buy Xbox version.\n\n\n<Korean Version>\n\n로컬 코옵이라는건 작동하지도 않고, 마우스 감도 병신같지, 옵션 그지같고, 최적화 전혀 안했고, 시프트 키 누를때마다 스팀창 뜨지, 뭐 하려고만하면 창모드 전환되지, 카메라 앵글도 존나 등신 같고 버그도 개같고 난이도 변경 안되지, 게임 디자인도 불평하고 싶은게 많음. 그렇다고 게임이 재밌는것도 아니고... 정하고 싶으면 엑박 버전으로 사요. 그건 코옵 되니까.\n\n병신게임. 아오♥♥♥♥♥♥. 내 것도 사고 스팀친구 두 명한테 선물했는데 진짜 내가 또 낚여서 이 지랄을 하다니.\n\n<5월 24일 추가>\n\n오늘 보니 패치가 되었는지, 많은 문제가 해결되었습니다.\n노마드 게임즈가 이런 문제를 해결하려는 점은 매우 기쁘게 생각하지만,\n한편으로는 베타버전 게임을 일반가에 팔았다는 생각에 불쾌감도 드네요.\n\n아마 패치를 통해 지속적으로 문제를 해결하고, 코옵도 추가해 넣을 것으로 보입니다.\n그래도 혹시 모르니 킬팀을 살 생각이 있으신 분은 문제가 해결될때까지 지켜보라고 말씀드리고 싶네요.","May 22, 2014","false","7.4"," 385 of 541 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","385","541","0","5"

On the 2nd stage the camera got locked behind the terrain and wouldn't move, so that I was looking at a very tiny character from behind multiple layers of terrain, making the game simply unplayable.\n\nSome very basic bugtesting would have been...adequate. Sadly, it was not possible to explore the rest of the game, nor desirable to; the stilted camera panning and forced waiting to show you where to go (in what is basically a linear corridor shooter) was completely unneeded and interrupts any sense of fun. The fact that this is a console game is evident as soon as you realize you can't even use the mouse for menu options, and the lack of overall quality further reflects that whatever this game was supposed to be was held back by being a console game first and foremost. Very disappointing.\n\n0/10 not playable, not worth a purchase for ANY discount.","June 23, 2015","false","0.8"," 70 of 85 people (82%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","82","70","85","6","1"

But I asked myself how bad can it be? Now I know.\nThe technical glitches are mentioned enough in other reviews and honestly I can forgive the camera being stuck in one level, the intro video showing green artifacts and so on, if they were the only flaw in the game.\nEven when the camera works (that is most of the time) the view is often obscured by objects in the foreground. It is plainly annoying to have to play were is Waldo ever so often to find my character inside the scenery. And having a panning camera in a twin stick shooter game is a plain bad Idea. Especially if it’s two players. I remember seeing more space marines drop to their untimely death because of camera movement, than falling to the enemy.\nSpeaking of which: the combat while initially fun is utterly unbalanced. If you want a cheap victory, go for the rocket launcher. This of course leads the scoring system in the two player campaign ad absurdum.\nSo if you do not expect much but a mediocre twin stick shooter in the 40k setting, go for it. If you want a good game, I am afraid you will not find it here.","September 19, 2015","false","3.1"," 45 of 51 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","45","51","0","0"

Sometimes, not even rarely, it goes behind walls or simply shows the other way rather than where you wanna see.\n- Unskippable gamescenes. That's the worst! You die and start from the last checkpoint, but mostly all starts with a gamescene you have to view again and again and again.

So beware of that.\n- Out of 4 Classes, 2 are virtually useless because being a melee class just ends up getting you killed extremely fast.\n- Minor bothers like asset re-using from other Dawn of War games.\n\nHowever, basically this would be a competent and fun twin-stick shooter but two things kill this game entirely. Glitches and the worst camera of gaming. Seriously, the camera is pure sin. I had to restart so many times because the camera decided it doesn't want to follow me anymore, and even when it works it tends to be in really bad spots.\n\nAnd the most notable glitch I experienced was with moving platforms, aka elevators. I don't know what was wrong but my Marine and enemies would glitch through or get bounced off from it, falling to my death.\n\n\nTl;dr\n---------\nI had to start the third Mission like 14 times because I died in the cutscene to the elevator. I died in the cutscene. Don't buy this broken piece of Warhammer blasphemy.

The game encompasses your player moving through the map at a steady pace. There is no sprint or dodge, but movement is highly recommended at all times here. What makes it fun is having a buddy to play with, as I couldn't really get into it playing myself. Would I recommend this game? Only on the pretense you're playing co-op. The game is fun, there are characters with their own respective power ups that you can choose from. On top of being able to use your shooting ability, a melee attack is supplemental to what your character has. There is also a power up that your character is able to use given a cool-down or given you pick up a power up laying around the level. Over the course of the game, you unlock different (constant) abilities in which you can decide which one to give your character. For the most part of the game, you will be using one joystick while aiming and firing with another.\n\nThe graphics are decent, they neither go below or above, simply satisfactory. The sounds in game for the guns are sort of meek, and don't provide any exceptional experience for your cochlea.\n\nThis game has as much playability if you like the Warhammer series.

You are being forced down the narrow road of using a controller. Narrator is very dull though, almost Tech Priest levels of monotone, and yet a master of quotes ("Drown the generator in its own filth", "Here comes the green tide"). However, the entire joy from this is from the rampant destruction and death, and it delivers well. Slow motion kill cams are present for random final kills, yet it does seem to slow down the FPS rather than anything else: this could be limited to my experience.\n\nCustomisation of your marine is available, choice of four marines but only one weapon (melee or ranged) can be changed on each, and simply just use the most recently unlocked weapon because guaranteed it will be an improvement. You can also choose your chapter of Marines, however that's fairly limited to some of the more popular chapters (sadly including the Ultra Smurfs).\n\nSurvival and local co-op for those with battle brothers.\n\ntl;dr: £6.99 to purge xenos filth in his holy name.","May 22, 2014","true","1.3"," 187 of 338 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","187","338","0","5"

Liked it on PSN, like it even more on PC (that stable framerate!). Basically the best thing that came out of Dawn of War 2 (models and music are re-used assets of that disappointingly boring sequel) and the closest thing to a 40K arcade game that is going to happen any time soon.\n\nIt's neither the prettiest, smartest or otherwise particularly outstanding game under the sun (in fact, it is quite prone to glitching out in some way or the other) BUT it is nicely simplistic, dumb alien blasting twinstick-fun (you point in a direction, stuff dies). Features some nice vistas, good use of color and a truly epic final boss battle. Killing thousands of filthy xenos in the name of the Emperor feels pretty good for the most part, the Dawn of War music playing in the background makes you feel righteously superior over all the pitiful creatures trying to step up to you and mowing down hordes of enemies with a rapid-firing spreadshooting missile-launcher brings a smile to my face. Good thing I don't have to clean up the mess afterwards.\n\nThumbs up to the devs for not bothering with customizations or RPG-crap - this is a game about slaughtering them all and not showing mercy. Period. The more you kill, certain perks and a few weapons will unlock - but this is no gamechanger and pretty much makes you KILL MORE STUFF ONLY FASTER!  Also, 40K: Killteam works great in local coop (you know, like back in the arcade - you and your mate against the odds) and is simple enough to play even when completely smashed.\n\nMight hold only limited appeal if you are not a 40K fanboy but otherwise offers a few hours of slightly mediocre, arcade-ish fun.","November 23, 2014","true","6.6"," 29 of 46 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","29","46","4","0"

It's not a bad port, but neither is it a good one. The best you can do with options is change your resolution (Contrary to popular belief, you /can/ use widescreen resolutions), enable V-sync and windows to fullscreen. Some people complained about the absence of mouse sensitivity options, but for me it was just right.\n\nThe game itself is essentially what I would say is Alien Swarm with Space Marines. You have two melee oriented classes, which are the Librarian and the Vanguard Veteran Marine. The VV Marine is more focused on killing essentially everything in sight with melee, whereas the Librarian is a good support class with an area of effect explosion special ability, which is good for taking large groups of enemies at once.\n\nYou also have two ranged oriented classes, which are the Techmarine and the Sternguard Veteran Marine. The Techmarine is good at holding positions due to his Tarantuala Turret deployable ability. (You'll have to hold a fair amount of places in the game, and the Tarantula Turret helps a lot with this.) The SV Marine is a ranged version of the VV Marine, with the focus fire ability which increases damage and fire rate to great effect when dealing with continued hordes of enemies.\n\nThe game also features power-ups, giving the game a more arcade-style feel to it. There are several ranged based power-ups, some of which increase the amount of bullets fired (Shooting two at once, etc.), or how fast the weapon is firing. There is also an invincibility power-up, which gives about 20 or so seconds if invulnerability to all attack. The health power-up automatically heals a portion of your health then begins auto-regenerating until the timer on the power-up runs out. There's only one melee oriented power-up, the Righteous Fury, which increases damage, and increases speed as well.\n\nThe storyline is rather basic, you crash into the Ork Kroozer, intent on destroying it before it reaches the Imperial Forge World it was headed for, by destroying generators and finding power cells. The narrarator is fairly monotone, but he has more expression in his voice than people who actually talk monotone. It's pretty short, about 3-4 hours when played casually,  I would bet around 1 or 2 for a speed run.\n\nI bought this on release day, having wanted the game since I first heard about it, but not having an Xbox 360 to play it on, and I wasn't disappointed. The co-op is a little bot wonky, considering the second player doesn't have a targeting reticule, but for the most part, I highly enjoyed the game, and would give it an 8/10.","May 25, 2014","true","7.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Let’s get the elephant in the room out first, NO Kill Team does not have online co-op and YES that would have made it many times better with hours of replayability. And no it’s not even close to the best WH40k game out there. But for $10 (or less if you get it on sale) it’s a perfectly fun little twin-stick using the 40k aesthetic that you can put around 4-5 hours into to beat the main plot, and around 10 if you want to round up the achievements. For me at least I got my monies worth, I agree things could have been done to make it better, but what is here is still quite entertaining for the duration its contents can provide.\n\nThere’s not much to say gameplay-wise, if you’ve played a good quality twin-stick shooter before you’ve played this game. If you haven’t then the genre is marked by constant action, using one stick to move and the other to shoot in a 360-degree radius at any time like a turret on legs (or alternatively the keyboard and mouse works too). Persistent upgrades you get through gaining points liven things up as do unlockable weapons, they mostly just make you more powerful but it’s still a fun little side-item to inject a bit of activity into the usual twin-stick formula.\n\nGraphics are decent, outdated but the game is several years old having come out before Space Marine despite just now coming to Steam. Still they work and more importantly the colorful WH40k aesthetic is carefully rendered so even without eye-popping visuals it’s nice to look at. There are only the basest strings of a story here, usual fluff stuff; an Ork Kroozer is inbound on a Forge World and you have to stop them by shooting a billion enemies and occasionally blowing up some machinery, nothing complicated and it only serves to shuffle you from objective to objective.\n\nSo yeah, WH40k: Kill Team isn’t the best game ever, and the lack of Online Co-op is a negative. But what’s presented here should still keep any WH40k fan distracted for a couple evenings. And given the meager selling price for what you get I think all the reviews ripping it apart seem really entitled, like how dare they don’t provide a triple-A gaming experience for ten bucks!\n\nOh well. Anyhow I say go ahead and get the game if you just want a fun little time waster set in the 40k universe.","June 21, 2014","true","11.6"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

Even if you are not familiar with the universe, you may have some fun with this game. However, if you're big into the lore/tabletop game, you should definitely consider a purchase.\n\nIn Kill Team, there are four classes, two melee, two ranged. Although they all practically play the same, it is interesting to experiment with different classes for each mission. Power-ups dot the landscape of each level, which enhance your character for short bursts of time.\nThe campaign is as you'd expect, run around and blow stuff up real good. Don't buy the game for the story, though. If you're expecting Dickens, you're in for a nasty surprise.\nThere is also a survival mode, where a relentless wave of enemies charge at you, and you ( and preferably a friend) must push them back.

It may only be local, but it is great fun when you've got a friend to kill some time with.  Just remember you need at least one controller for co-operative play.\n\nOverall, Kill Team is arcade fun only made better by a friend.

And so comes WH40K: Kill Team, a simple story-driven twin-stick shooter set in the Warhammer 40K Universe.  It possesses some good gun-toting action, character customization providing different skills and weapons.  Thus allowing for different playthrough styles.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n+ Its set in the Warhammer 40K universe.  Great if you're a fan.\n+ Good graphics.  Very pleasing on the eye for a twin-stick shooter.\n+ Good varied and well rendered environments for a port.  Gives it a good feeling of immersion.\n+ Warrior customization.  Good number of WH40K space marine types.  Together with good range of weapons provides some variation in playing style.\n+ You get to kill Orks with some solid gun-toting gameplay.\n\nTHE BAD:\n- Its an iOS port.\n- Short campaign of 5 missions taking about 10 hours to get (all) achievements.\n- Mission length is also pretty short.\n- No manual save.  Just annoying save checkpoints.\n- Fixed camera makes controlling your warrior terrible in some fights.\n- Bugged camera sometimes giving weird angles.  Only resolved on restarting a mission.\n- Requires an xbox controller or emulator for one achievement (local coop).\n- Very little longevity.  Achievements force at least two playthroughs.\n\nAND THE ORDINARY:\n* RPG-lite perk assignment as you level.  Gives the choice of up two perks that grow in power.\n* Various time-limited power-ups allows for additional tactical actions.\n* Fiddly controls.\n* Swarm A.I. but at least it presents a decent challenge.\n* Some replayability by selecting different characters.\n* Only local coop available.  Need controller.\n\nVERDICT:\nOverall WH40K: Kill Team is an average twin-stick experience unless you are a fan of Warhammer 40K, at least in single-player.  It probably plays slightly better with a friend.  On the whole gameplay is quite fun though it has some frustrating moments, most notably with bad camera angles.  There are better games of its type out there.\n\nI can really only recommend if you are fan of the Warhammer franchise, like short games, easy achievements or are heavily into twin-stick shooters.  Its too short to buy at full price.  If you dont mind waiting for this, get it only at extreme discount.","May 2","true","10.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

There isn't much to write home about this game though. Sadly.\n\nThe game comprises of set levels with some objectives, and killing more Orcs. The graphics are basic but work, but the gameplay is flat out arcade. It is fun in enjoyable bites and can be a great time waster, or something when you need a break from W40k DoW.\n\nI would have named it "Orc Killing Simulator", but I didn't develop it.

Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team is a top down shooter that offers 4-player co-op adventure that’s entertaining to the end.\n\nStory:\nYour mission begins as you encounter an orc ship on route to invade a sector of the imperium. You are sent on a mission of the upmost importance to disable the invasion ship and figure out the orc plans. As your mission progresses you realize this is an impossible mission and completion requires the top fighters. Luckily you’re a member of the Blood Angles one of the elite fighting forces of the Emperors Space Marines chapters.  It is up to you and your team to defeat the Warboss and protect the galaxy.\n\nCampaign:\nThe campaign consists of five-levels, which vary in length based on your play style. Each level took me around 30-minutes, with the campaign lasting about 3-4 hours depending on how many times you die. One of the pit falls is that when you die you typically either get warped back a considerable distance or you have to watch a cinematic again. I didn’t find myself dying too much, so it wasn’t too bad but it could get annoying if you happened to die quite a few times. Overall the campaign is typically a run with a varying missions in-between; either surviving waves of enemies in a confined space, running on exploding platforms, planting explosives, fighting epic boss battles, and more.\n\nGameplay:\nOverall there are a good variety of enemies which keep the game interesting and offering a nice variety. There are four separate classes two melee and two ranged specialists. The classes form a bell curve of extreme range power to extreme melee power. The weapons and ability power-ups are unlocked randomly throughout the campaign and to achieve the best benefits typically involves switching characters between each map. Each class has a special ability that offers even more diversity between each class. The campaign is a top down shooter where hordes of enemies charge at you and you must fight them off either by slashing them apart, blasting them to shreds, or exploding with bombs.\n\nHints:\n>The metla gun is ridiculously over-powered.\n>The melee classes are at a huge disadvantage as every mission requires you to use a ranged weapon at some point where power is very important.\n>The special abilities are powerful try not to forget about them, there is no point in saving them as you regenerate ability points after killing only a few enemies.\n\nResults:\nAll and all Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team is a great game. Some of the gameplay elements could use adjusting, but it’s nothing that ruins the game. I personally played the game alone and I had a great time and could only imagine it being better with some friends. The gameplay is relatively straightforward and the difficulty curve is well laid out offering a fun campaign at a good length. I would highly recommend this game if you can get it for a good price (I got it for $1.99 and felt that was just the right price).\n\nPros:\n+Four classes with relatively high diversity making them interesting.\n+Buffs and weapons unlocked randomly which cause you to switch classes to take advantage of them.\n+Five levels with varying missions, strategies, and battles which offer great dynamics.\n+Four player co-operative experience (if you have the friends).\n+In mission weapon/buff switch to mix things up if you need to.\n\nCons:\n-Relatively expensive for such a short game, $9.99 is rather high for a 3-hour campaign.\n-The checkpoints are few and far between and when you die they cause you to watch cinematics without being able to skip them.\n-The camera angles can be a pain every now and then causing you to not see what you’re looking for.\n-The melee classes were not designed to solo some of the missions very well.","March 31, 2015","true","4.2"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","15","24","0","0"

You attack a large crude space-faring vessel full of Orks in a bid to destroy it from the inside out before it can make it to human-occupied space.\n\nI played this game a few years back on X-Box 360 with my brother, so I'm familiar with the controls.  Additionally, this is definitely much more fun when you play Two-Player.  There is no PvP mode.\n\nIn the grim darkness of the future, there is only war -so the game's vocal stabs are just instructions and GRIMDARK reminders that you're a Space Marine.  No comedy to be had here, unlike Smash TV one of this game's inspirations.  My brother and I entertained ourselves by referencing humorous game fluff and mocking the Ork's accents.  I swear, I kept hearing them going after "SPICE MARINES!" so I had to call the Marines "Brother Scary Spice" and "Brother Vengeful Spice".\n\nThe warriors have enough variety that you can get replay value from switching up your characters.  I stuck mostly with "Sternguard Veteran", which is the heavy weapons guy -strong ranged attacks, weak melee.  His special attack is easiest to understand -just more dakka, you don't have to steer him, or herd your enemies into a killbox.\n\nI recommend this game -it's a fun game for the price, and if you are a fan of the Warhammer 40,000, you should have already played it.

After not bringing the game to PC for such a long time, you'd like to think they did something special like maybe updated the graphics, added online play, or at least polished the controls!  But no, there's none of that here.\nThe game uses assets from Dawn of War 2: Retribution, models that look wonderful when viewed from half mile from up in the sky like it was in the original RTS format.  In these cramped and confined quarters though, everything looks really bad.\nThe controls work with mouse and keyboard, but there are some peculiar oddities such as running not seeming to work well and melee attacks often missing due to the odd way are "fired".  At least the developer was kind enough to change the XBox button prompts to pictures of Keyboard letters.  That's a small bonus that MANY games forgo doing.\nFinally, while I understand this was a couch-co-op game for Xbox 360, that niche doesn't really exist on the PC market.  You might expect some for of online co-op, but from my wanderings through the menus, I found no such option available.  I hope you like a friend crowding your computer desk with another body, because it's local co-op or solo.\nMany more minor annoyances exist, and I'm nearly shocked that this is the same price as when it first came out nearly 3 years ago.  If significant content were added, and the game was more finely ported to PC, I could understand such an asking price.  But I almost immediately regretted paying full price for this game.  Even if I paid $5, that might be too much for me.  My advise is wait for a steep sale or just pass this by for something better.","May 22, 2014","false","0.9"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","18","32","0","1"

The four classes are a little varied between melee or ranged focus. There is no online co-op, but there is a local co-op. Since this is a console port, you will need a controller for the second player. Keyboard controls are acceptable for solo, my only complaint being that sometimes you need to go diagonal or similar directions to not fall off a platform and keyboard controls aren't perfect for those range of movements.","August 9, 2014","true","5.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And while it's never going to top the Greatest Games Ever list, it turned out to be a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe voice acting and music are solid, both informative and thematically appropriate. The graphics are serviceable, and the physics interactivity is balanced just right to give weight to the combat without the bounciness Havok can occasionally lead to. It also allows for a bit of strategy, as heavy objects can be moved to provide cover. And the combat feels right, too - the Orks come at you in a tide that feels *almost* - but not quite - unstoppable, the weapon sounds are mostly sufficient, and set dressing crumbles and explodes all over the place.\n\nAdd to that well-placed checkpoints, nicely-balanced difficulty curves, a fairly wide range of skins and rather nice level design, and there's a fair amount of game here for a not terribly onerous price.\n\nThere are downsides - an anaemic options menu, a lack of mouse control in the menu and slightly sluggish controls in-game, and of course the occasionally infuriating automatic camera - but for this price it's a really fun game for a quick 40K topup in between dinner and bedtime.","August 23, 2014","true","1.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

The graphical design holds up well on low end systems and runs rather smoothly. The port itself onto PC is rather good aswell, however it does take a few deaths until the game decides to get you a tip on how to use a grenade right.\n\nLevels can be repetitive but the 4 classes you can play as does give it a bit of life. But overall I believe the design of the game to be very good and presents a good challenge to the player. . . but not inn the sense you would expect.\n\nHere is the big problem with this game: the camera. I don't know who programmed the camera in this game but whoever it is should take a refresher course. Level after level, I would reach the next section only to be attacked from the left side by a wave of Orks I didn't see due to the camera doing "look the fancy scenery" thingy. Getting the camera into a good position is a bit like a hungry child, wearing oven gloves, trying to get beetroot out of a jar.\n\nWhile this game is basically a close up version of Dawn of War 2, I hesitate to say that as it just doesn't hold up in comparison, it just feels too much like a cash in on the license. I do recommend this game but with great caution as the camera makes the game much harder and frustrating than what it should be.","June 16, 2014","true","7.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The graphics and sounds are decent, it does have that "40K universe" feel about it, sort of a gritty steampunk environment aboard the Ork ship, what with all the chains and vats amidst platforms and scrap metal. Whilst the campaign is short, a straight-forward multi-part mission, because there are four classes of Space Marine to use there is the potential to play it through four times, to see how differently the game plays out with their various weapons and forms of attack but without lengthy repetitiveness, I could see myself replaying this a few times in a short space of time easier than a AAA game such as Bioshock Infinite.\n\nI bought this for SP gameplay and don't intend to play co-op, but I do feel that some of the negative reviews border on pathetic with far too many expectations for a 3-year-old game at this price and ported from a console – it's less than a 2Gb download which suggests that it's going to be short and punchy, not a long-lasting open world RPG experience or as structured as the excellent Dawn of War games. Works fine with an Xbox 360 controller, I haven't played a twin-stick shooter before, and I find that having to line your marine up at a 45-degree angle (8-way shooting), to pick off some targets who come at you from awkward angles, a little annoying, but you soon get used to it and compensate.\n\nMy main grievances are: that some of the checkpoints are badly placed, cutscenes can't be skipped, and the camera angle can't be rotated to give a custom viewpoint – some of the fixed angles are a little awkward, but not too often, thankfully. I quite like the perks system, they give reasonable benefits without leading to overkill. So far as I'm aware the game has one difficulty level, it's not a hard game but there are one or two tricky moments.\n\nOverall this game is worth about 7/10 for what it offers so long as you don't expect anything special or highly original. Good for a laugh rather than a challenge.","May 26, 2014","true","8.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The only reason I joined Steam, originally, was to play the Dawn of War series. I would be the first person to sing my praise to high heavens for an Orks (and Nids) Must Die! set in Warhammer40K universe.\n\nAs a software, it functions: it runs smoothly on my 4 year old potato, there is no glaring glitch or bug, and while some may complain about the obvious port it does not assign R2 button to your melee command so there's that.\n\nThe problem, again, is that infuriating question of fun and lack thereof. Considering this is not a lore-centric title with the sole purpose of slaying Orks, it fails to deliver anything but disappointment--I mean, I had absolutely no expectations and I was still let down. Camera seems to exist only to fuel your wrath, power-ups and perks are as stock as they can be (because of how bland they are, the super-serious announcement voice for power-ups is all the more cringe-inducing), and the sound effects seem to nag you with existential, self-doubting question: why the hell are you playing this game where guns don't even sound like guns?\n\nThe whole project, from the announcement voice to uninspired gameplay to its mini-game length, has something of a business-like air to it, like the game was not something the developers wanted to make but a soul-sapping obligation on their contract to churn out an action-oriented Warhammer40K game. As a fan of the series, its universe, factions and Emperor-knows-what-else, nothing is more disheartening than this.\n\nCo-op will not change the lack of entertainment or soul in this game, so don't drag your friend or family into this.

Though i would suggest looking at some game play footage,  This genre of game people tend to either really enjoy or really hate.  The game's akin to 40k Gauntlet.  it's a bit short though, only about 2 hour campagin and that is with doubling back checking for hidden things.  Only local co-op, the ability to invite friends over steam to play would be nice.  With multiplayer the game becomes a bit broken where to , as long as you're paying half attention you most likely won't die unless you walk off the edge of the terrian.\nI personally would like a 4 player co-op mode, but that's just me.\nSo if you like 40k, third person, almost top down shooters.  And all around murdering orks with friends, this game is worth throwing $10 bucks at.

First off, the save situation - or the complete lack of it. Progress through a mission, broken up between checkpoints and that's fine - whilst you continue to play the game. Quit the game during a mission however and your progress within that mission is totally lost. There's no ability AT ALL to save within a mission. You either play it through completely - or redo the entire mission when you relaunch the game. Silly.\n\nThe progress through the level can at times be ludicriously hampered by a failed camera system. You have no control over which way or elevation that the camera maybe be pointing. I've 'lost' the camera several times, often wandering off into the darkness of tunnels that I cannot see and blindly reaching a point where the camera decides to catch up. Again, a silly oversight. Why hasn't the player got control of the camera?\n\nThen there's the fact that the enemies appear every single time at exactly the same the point. On occassion when I've died, I've reapproached the same point of the level - firing into blank space, knowing full well that a bunch of orcs are due to appear. Sure enough, they do.\n\nI've yet to play this co-operatively and I think that's where the game will truly shine. Though god-knows how the camera issues are compounded in that mode! Also, the game itself looks to be very short - though I've not completed it as yet.\n\nOverall, a taster really of what type of game this really could be. Different factions of marines, much more choice on equipment and weaponry - and a random element of the opposing forces sent out to stop you. All would make this game much more appealing and enjoyable in the long term. As it is, 6/10.","May 31, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also due to the game having control of the camera your reticule will sometimes move to the wrong spot meaning your shots will fly harmlessly past enemies.\nCutscenes can't be skipped so when replaying or respawning you have to watch them over & over (alot of which don't show anything important).\nCo-op is local only so you'll need a gamepad and friend/warm body to play that mode with.\n\nOverall it's a fun couple of hours with replayability if you want to play through the campaign with each class.\nFor the price they're asking, it's not a bad invesment.","May 23, 2014","true","6.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeSpeletajs/recommended/275610/","DeSpeletajs","De Speletajs...","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeSpeletajs/","47 products in account","The game is so terrible that I will have nightmares about it. I regred that i buyed it on 25% off summer sale. The game in this status should have never hit the shelfs.\n\nThe game has no real story line except "shoot that" and "blow up that". Nothing is really explained why its there or where the orc ship is even going. Might as well change some names and this would be Warcraft franchise. None of orcs or space marines say anything important. None of the orcs except for 5th scenario where Orc Warboss screams:"Kill the humans" (might play it alone, so only 1 human on all the orc space ship) and thats about it. That comper voice made me sick at the end. One space marine (maybe 2 still impossible) goes on solo rampage to kill thousands of orcs and tyranids. Whoever thought of this games storyline has probobly never read a WH40k book or even had a thought whats in them.  In conclusion story sucked so much...\n\nAbout the game play which was boring by the fifth scenario. Boss fights were annoying and mostly relied upon thrash mobs which were killed about 95% of the game. No real game mechanics were in the boss fights the same shooting and sh*it blowing up stuff.The range attacks in game are only thing needed. Melee attacks have 0 purpose I don't see reason why they should be there. Melee has no real advantage, not stronger than range, no special moves, no purpose for ANY objectives in game. Most close combat enemies can be killed by shooting at one point and you don't even have to move if you have a rocket launcher. Targeting system was ridiculous, the targets I didn't want to shoot I shot and targets I wanted to shoot most of the time I didn't shoot. Holding my mouse key all the time "was so much fun" (sarcasm). There is a reason why most shooting game weapons have somekind of reload system, so that close range attacks had purpose and that range attacks aren't over powered. This game broke both of those rules. About 95% of the games objectives can't be even harmed by melee attacks. Enemy intelligence was nothing more than "run that way when near him attack". If the players was smart enought he could trap enemies in corners, stairs and walls. The game most of the time looked untested and was made in "its finaly over lets put it on sale im about 51% sure there are no bugs" style.\n\nGraphics were good I can say that, but some game models looked really ridiculous. For example, Warboss tank was in scale of details of medium, but the Warboss it self looked like so high details that he could shine like gold and everybody would have expected it. Camera angle most of the time was kind of good. There were parts were you could understand that its angle is made so that "this part of the game will be harder", but most of the times it was annoying. I don't understand the purpose of so highly detailed models if camera was so far from them that all I could think was shooting those dots. Explosions were too much. If a player has a rocket launcher his eyes will probobly burn out from all the flames he encounters. Some game graphics were wierd and ignored most of the rules of physics. For example, how can a crate stand on air or floor fall in the ground when there is clearly a columns supporting it and how can a handgun destroy an iron wall? This is WH40k universe, but even their handguns aren't that powerfull. In conclusion great graphics, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ attachment to the game.\n\nI would give this game a 2/10 rating if it was my call. It ruined the whole WH40k franchise and I am disappointed.  I regred that I bought it. I would say there would be needed alot of patches to fix this game. It looks like it was realised in late alpha.","June 25, 2014","false","3.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

All you really do is run through the levels killing Orks as you go and are rewarded with upgrades and powerups. It is actually pretty fun and I imagine it is even better played cooperatively with other people. My main criticisms of the game is that there are no advanced options for tweaking the graphics and the resolution is limited to 1024 x 768 and there is no way to control the camera angle on your own. So if your view is obstructed by something in the foreground you're pretty much screwed and it is fairly annoying when you cannot tell where an enemy is attacking you from. Maybe Sega will release some kind of update that at least addresses the graphics and resolution issues like they did with Strider.","May 22, 2014","true","1.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The overall feel is spot on for the univere it's set in and it's just enough game for the purpose it was built for. And that was to build up hype for the Space Marine release.\nMy one and only complaint about this game is that there is no option for online multiplayer. But so long as you have at least one other friend into the 40k univers, this should be too large an issue.\n\nNow to the truth of it. Unless you are an avid fan of the 40K univers, this game is not for you. It was a shallow story at best so you will really have no clue as to what you are really doing or why. The fluff codex doesnt supply enough information to immerse yourself in the fiction and the light customisation such as weapons and skins will have no meaning as they have no real impact of the game and are severly limited\n\nFor the fans of the univers I do though highly recomend this game.

It's far too costly for a short game of 5 medium sized levels. That being said it is a tiny game and a far too large asking price (until this sale anyway).\n\nHowever, I freaking love the feel of this game. How solidly the guns fire and hit targets and the sight of creatures I've in model form charging at you or shooting you. That feeling as you mow down huge mobs of enemies and how it incorporates the lore to create interesting scenarios.\n\nThe power-up system does kind of put you out of it, but after you've played awhile you'll thank the emperor they were there because it does get difficult at parts to the point of near impossible without those things.\n\nAll in all if you want some quick dumb fun that feels so good, get it (when its on sale). Especially if you want to ♥♥♥♥ around with a friend.\n\nFor those struggling with getting coop play to work. Get a wireless receiver for your wireless controllers and voila you have controllers that work exactly like console versions, making player ports easy to nab. Plugging in 2 controllers does the trick too.\n\nMost games port keyboard and first controller to player 1, though you can trick a controller into taking port 2 by why go all the trouble?","August 7, 2014","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Really?), the weapons don't feel as satisfying as in Space Marine, certain missions feel unbalanced or rigged unintentionally against you, music is recycled from DoW2, and most of the animations which make all previous Warhammer 40K games so satisfying and unique are gone in the name of fast, unending action.\n\nI guess that's all because the game is a dual-stick shooter, which has it's uses.

I couldn't even get past the first mission without frustration.  The game is simple enough and an alright shooter but the camera is awful.  If you think you're going to pan around or the camera angle is going to make sense then you are sadly mistaken. The mob AI is buggy - orcs don't path correctly and cannot figure out how to walk up a ramp to get you, instead they run around underneath or jog around in circles making it easy to pick them off. Fights with harder orcs are easy as you can just blast them at range and they stand there like idiots.  Graphical issues within the first few seconds of the intro, sad.\n\nI never got through the first mission sadly.  I went to take a screenshot which apparently killed the game.  Upon loading back up even though I went through several checkpoints it did not save anything and it started me at the very begining of the mission. Will I play through and give this another chance? No thanks, rather run a cheese grater over my eyes then pour salt into the wounds.\n\n","January 18","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Underneath all of the crap is a very fun game, so it is really a shame. A very short game, around 4 hours, with some of the worst checkpointing/cheap deaths I have ever seen. It really is sickening, particularly how I keep dying on the last boss and have to redo a substantial amount every time. It is going to take all of my willpower to finish this awful game. I was at the part where the warboss teleports out and swarms you with little monsters little did I know after killing a bunch it tells me to fall back but I am on the other side of the boss so when the camera pans for me to run the other way, I am instantly and unavoidably swarmed and killed by a plethora of orcs that pour on top of me out of a portal just because I wasn't on the other side of the area when the timed event started. So because of that I get to redo a ton of work because the checkpointing is so unbelievably bad. It happens a lot and I see why this game got bad reviews: it is a mess that was not done right and has since not been fixed. Oh and the ranged orcs bullets never miss, meaning you are going to get constantly mowed down by their fire and forced to do some parts over and over again.\n\nThe sound is way too low. I had to put music on 2 then crank up my speakers to even hear sound effects. The melee class is worthless because why would I want to right click twenty thousand times per level when I can just pick a ranged character and hold down mouse 1 to fire. The graphics are terrible too. Very jaggedly edged and looks like a game from 2006.\n\nIt could have been way better if it had not been made by a bunch of complete idiots but as it is, it is still, besides its awful faults, a fun isometric shooter with blood, guts, explosions, and some serious orc ♥♥♥ kicking. Although because of its ultra short length, don't pay over $5 for it.\n\n5/10, because it is only 4 hours, has serious technical faults, and only if you pay $5 or less like I did. Otherwise it is very hard to recommend this.","December 15, 2014","false","7.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

While I enjoyed the console variant, this one has some problems right away after playing 10 minutes in.\n\n-The camera follows you as you run through the levels, but has a tendency to not 'snap' to new angles as needed. This does have some comedic effect to see your character walk away as you que that sad walking away music from the Incredible Hulk. The effect wanes though when you realize that it becomes UNPLAYABLE.\n\n-CoOp is local only. I would have loved to blast through this with a few buddies, but it simply won't happen.

If you don't love Warhammer 40k you might just be a homosexual. And that's why I write this review - because I love the Warhammer 40k universe and have been disappointed by this game.\n\nAny Warhammer game should preserve the feel of the source material and universe it's set in. Kill Team performs well when it comes to making you feel like a Space Marine. You can choose from several hero classes to play as, with seperate, class-only weapons and special abilities and a truckload of perks to help you smash your bloody way through the Hoarde. Graphical quality is average, as is sound, with nothing fantasic going on, but both doing a fine job.\n\nThis is a console port and unfortunately it shows with several issues. What appears to be often buggy script-triggering, leaving you alone and stuck and having to creativly find some way to commit suicide and restart from the last checkpoint to continue is the largest complaint. This also ties in with the camera. In my first playthrough of the first stage of the campaign this happened twice. Secondly there is no online co-op! Local co-op only, here! - What a disappointment this feature-lack was to me and I'm sure will be to many others. Thirdly is the camera itself - When it does work, many players will probably find the camera annoying and restrictive,as it moves on a rail around you depending on where you are in the level with no user-control over the viewpoint at all. When it stops working the camera gets stuck which leaves you to wander into the distance so far away you cant see yourself, or around a corner, or find yourself unable to progress (and commit suicide) if you're on a part of the level that requires another trigger to fire for the game to let you continue.\n\nWhen it's working well, even with a non-controllable viewpoint - it's quite a lot of fun! It plays smoothly and is a fine twinstick/swarm shooter and does fine justice to the Warhammer40k universe. However it's difficult to recommend even as a single-player experience with the game-breaking script and camera bugs which seem to be quite prevalant, even in my short time playing.\n\n---\n\nAs an update to this review after playing more of the campaign, the bugs continued. The camera script froze once in the second level and because game objects have problems with movers (meaning if your character is on a lift that is moving, they will jerk and sometimes clip and fall through), and the third campaign level has you starting on a lift, I found myself in a constant death loop. I gave up attempting to even begin the third level after 10 or so death/auto-restart attempts.\n\nThis console port is, in my experience, broken to the point of being literally unplayable.\n\n--\n\nAs a further addendum I discovered that enabling v-sync fixes most of the major issues with movers. I maintain that this is a fun play with a good feel when it works, but the bugs on this port combined with no online co-op (and only two-player local co-op) make it a purchase I feel you should consider seriously, especially if you're going to pay full price.","November 27, 2014","false","6.7"," 3 of 29 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","3","29","0","0"

The game is not without its flaws. It's buggy - I had to restart a couple of missions because of glitches, the camera often moves in such a way that's its difficult to figure out which way to point your right stick in order to shoot and only a couple of the classes felt truly useful in a single player setting (that being the Techmarine and Librarian).

You (and a friend) are Space Marines tasked with clearing an Ork Kroozer from the space around a Forge World. Later on you encounter the Tyranids, and the short campaign has its share of cutscenes and dialog, the majority of it is cribbed from other Warhammer games, notably Space Marine.\n\nWhat the largest let down is: no online multiplayer, and further, the multiplayer REQUIRES players to be on the same physical computer! While this normally isn't so bad for some games (and is normal for consoles), this is absolutely crippling for a twin stick multiplayer game on the PC!\n\nThe game is otherwise fairly detailed and you do get to play as Champion Space Marine badasses that can solo "infiltrate" the enemy ship and murder your way to through the end. The levels are linear and the the camera work is annoying in the extreme - sometimes glitchy. The difficulty is average with some neat set piece fights as well as slogs of massed enemy troops.\n\nWould recommend on deep discount, but otherwise pass.","September 8, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I feel like I've given it a decent go, but the problem is something most people have noted: the camera angles. You have no control over them, and quite often mean you can't see enemies, or even tell where your character is going. It's not a big issue on the first mission, but as you progress and checkpoints become less frequent, it becomes a major issue.\n\nAdded to that is the way that your Space Marine can seem to shoot everything but the enemy. Case in point: a section of one mission requires you to protect a power cell whilst being attacked. Enemies will leap in at you from off-screen, engaging in melee, and trying to fight back against them more often than not leads to your marine blowing up the power cell himself, not the enemy. It's a neat idea, but ruined by the terrible camera and the way that targetting is horrible, really coming down to spray-and-pray. The lack of online co-op is a killer, too, and there's lots of graphical bugs throughout.\n\nI got this as part of a bundle, and I'm glad I didn't pay money specifically for it, or I'd have been left feeling incredibly disappointed. There's some fun ideas, and I like the way you unlock new equipment through killing enemies. I may give it another go at some point, but it's highly unlikely given that there's much better ways to waste my time.

The gameplay in Kill Team is not bad. Yes, it's a little repetitive, but the upgrade mechanism works well in a world where loot doesn't really make sense. However, the unskippable cutscenes issue simply kills the game utterly. Multi-character replay is not encouraged, as you have to 'learn' the same things you knew before. While I don't have a problem with being unable to skip a cutscene the first time through, let me skip it later. I am aware that these cutscenes may be disguising loading, but in that case the game loads very little information at a time, which is similarly unacceptable. I also have a problem with how far back in a level you are thrown upon death. Certain clear points for a potential 'checkpoint' are not utilised for that, and so you are catapulted back even further, which leaves a sense of futility.

Absolutely not. The intro video is bright green for myself and many others, the checkpoints are infrequent and dying can take you 10 minutes backwards.\n\nAnd the camera angles! Imagine Resident Evil 2's stationery perspective, but instead of following you room to room, it stays in one room and your character basically spends 80% of the game off-camera. It is glitchy as hell, I've seen orcs flying around the room like someone taped jetpacks to mosquitoes; they fall through the floor, get stuck in things... The whole game is a mess.\n\nBut is the game "good"? Yes, yes it is. It's a lot of fun for a twin-stick shooter. It has a bit of variety in terms of weapons and character selection.\n\nIf it had spent another year in development with a competent team who didn't reuse the entire art library from the original DoW, and they implemented proper ideas with a proper checkpoint system and a proper camera, this game would be first class. It's like a TSS version of Space Marine, if Space Marine had only spent 2 months in development.\n\nI would definitely recommend it as fun to play, as long as you can stand the glitchiness of it all.

The gameplay in Kill Team is not bad. Yes, it's a little repetitive, but the upgrade mechanism works well in a world where loot doesn't really make sense. However, the unskippable cutscenes issue simply kills the game utterly. Multi-character replay is not encouraged, as you have to 'learn' the same things you knew before. While I don't have a problem with being unable to skip a cutscene the first time through, let me skip it later. I am aware that these cutscenes may be disguising loading, but in that case the game loads very little information at a time, which is similarly unacceptable. I also have a problem with how far back in a level you are thrown upon death. Certain clear points for a potential 'checkpoint' are not utilised for that, and so you are catapulted back even further, which leaves a sense of futility.

While this 3rd person action shooter is entertaining, it falls short of even below par quality I would have expected. Glitches with poor camera angles, getting shot at in cutscenes, and even a lack of an interesting plot leaves me disappointed in this game. It feels like it was slopped together and rushed out for both consoles and PC to get a quick buck from casuals. Luckily I bought the game on sale. If you're a fan of space marines and the Warhammer 40,000 universe, go ahead and buy it if you have nothing else to do. However, if you're a seasoned veteran player, you'll realize that this game is borderline heresy. 4/10 on console. 5/10 on pc.","June 14, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having played through every mission at least twice now I am very happy with this purchase and what I am seeing in the level of detail and authentic feeling from this studio.  The game runs very smooth and is a joy to play with a dual stick controller.  I did have several glitches with textures, animations, or the camera while playing (tyranids react poorly to the melta gun on the kill cam for some reason), but only once did it feel "broken" with a stuck camera.  On second playthrough at the same point, the game worked fine.  While the unlock system did not make such sense as to why I suddenly got a new weapon or perk, aside from mowing down greenskins, it gave a nice sense of progression and gave reasons for replay as different classes.  The game is SHORT, but I liked that.  It really made it feel like I was a Space Marine on a tactical mission.   If they didn't finish the mission in 5hrs, where is the sense of urgency?  The game plays and sometimes feels like a budget arcade shooter, but the nice polish put on it made me appreciate the work put in.  As an example, shell casings eject from your weapon and bounce across the floor with real physics, and at one particular heavy point in the game I completely covered the entire area in spent rounds.  The physics and detailed character models made this truly feel like something you would expect from Games Workshop.  I would definitely buy a second installment or expansion with more missions.  Time to dust off that copy of Space Marine I have sitting around.","May 30, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Absolutely not. The intro video is bright green for myself and many others, the checkpoints are infrequent and dying can take you 10 minutes backwards.\n\nAnd the camera angles! Imagine Resident Evil 2's stationery perspective, but instead of following you room to room, it stays in one room and your character basically spends 80% of the game off-camera. It is glitchy as hell, I've seen orcs flying around the room like someone taped jetpacks to mosquitoes; they fall through the floor, get stuck in things... The whole game is a mess.\n\nBut is the game "good"? Yes, yes it is. It's a lot of fun for a twin-stick shooter. It has a bit of variety in terms of weapons and character selection.\n\nIf it had spent another year in development with a competent team who didn't reuse the entire art library from the original DoW, and they implemented proper ideas with a proper checkpoint system and a proper camera, this game would be first class. It's like a TSS version of Space Marine, if Space Marine had only spent 2 months in development.\n\nI would definitely recommend it as fun to play, as long as you can stand the glitchiness of it all.

I feel like I've given it a decent go, but the problem is something most people have noted: the camera angles. You have no control over them, and quite often mean you can't see enemies, or even tell where your character is going. It's not a big issue on the first mission, but as you progress and checkpoints become less frequent, it becomes a major issue.\n\nAdded to that is the way that your Space Marine can seem to shoot everything but the enemy. Case in point: a section of one mission requires you to protect a power cell whilst being attacked. Enemies will leap in at you from off-screen, engaging in melee, and trying to fight back against them more often than not leads to your marine blowing up the power cell himself, not the enemy. It's a neat idea, but ruined by the terrible camera and the way that targetting is horrible, really coming down to spray-and-pray. The lack of online co-op is a killer, too, and there's lots of graphical bugs throughout.\n\nI got this as part of a bundle, and I'm glad I didn't pay money specifically for it, or I'd have been left feeling incredibly disappointed. There's some fun ideas, and I like the way you unlock new equipment through killing enemies. I may give it another go at some point, but it's highly unlikely given that there's much better ways to waste my time.

You can as well play it with keyboard and mouse.\n\nYou pick one of four space marine specialities - melee, ranged, librarian and techmarine. There are only two differences between those classes - special attack and one weapon that you can change when unlocked.\n\nThe plot is pointless, basically a one man killing machine destroys an orc space ship and kills thousands of orcs and tyrranids. I've finished it with a Techmarine in under three hours.\n\nPros:\n- Warhammer 40k aesthetics\n- you can play it in co-op\n- you can unlock bonuses and additional weapons\n\nCons:\n- camerawork\n- some levels are absurd in design - e.g. you are in a central hub and need to go back and forth to every one of four nodes\n- it gets monotonous really fast\n- weapons feel as if they were not that powerful - it takes about 3-4 shots from bolter gun to kill a standard orc. Or maybe those enemies are that tough?\n- you can have only one powerup at a time\n- powerups last too short\n- classes are not well balanced - I think that ranged class is the most powerful because you can deal heavy damage from distance while avoiding taking hits when engaging in melee\n- special skills are dull - techmarine creates an automated shooting tower, melee class is charging on enemies ending the charge with explosion, ranged class has speed up to rate of fire (most useful imo) and librarian is creating a sucking vortex around himself that explodes after about 2 seconds\n\nOverall I feel that this may have been a good game but it lacks polish. Levels are too long, shooting orcs and tyrannids gets boring after about an hour. Maybe it is more fun in co-op, but I haven't played it this way. You can play it for a dollar or two, but I would not invest more money into this title. Space Marine game is a better shooter/slasher set in the Warhammer 40k world.\n\n----------\nFor anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/","March 27","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The second on character select, and finally twice on starting to play.\n\nI manage to get it working today. (Didn't change anything, just launched the game again in Single Player mode.)

There was clearly very little effort in porting this to PC from Xbox 360/PS3. Instructions are primarily for Xbox controller. I rolled my eyes a bit... I got this on sale, so not too offended.\n\nCharacter selection screen: awesome. Level design: cool! Colorful, Warhammer-style conflict. This kind of game could've hooked me on for a really long time... in fact, I was hoping it would. Instead, weird-♥♥♥ camera angles make the game just about unplayable.

I can see why people dislike the camera but personally found it not to be that bad, it attempts to make the fight more cinematic and sometimes it is a pain but I never found myself raging because of it. If you play this alone it can be pretty challenging too as you have a health bar and have to find health and running through attempting to gun and melee gets you killed pretty fast. Honestly if you love Warhammer 40k then buy this, its worth it.

Even though it's not technically cutting edge by any stretch, it's saturated in the war-worn, painted metal grime and blood one would expect from W40k media. The voice acting is appropriate and convincing, with your superior giving constant instructions and feedback via radio and Orks screaming in a thick, nasty British accent as they charge. The sound is pretty satisfying, especially the explosions--and there are a lot of explosions. The orchestral soundtrack is very fitting and in the few moments of pause between walls of sound (screaming, gunfire, explosions), I enjoyed it scaling up and down with the tension.\n\nGraphically it's nothing wonderful, lots of objects clipping through each other and relatively low-poly models like one might expect of a mid-quality console game ported to PC. That being said, this never once bothered me. One thing I REALLY appreciated is the lighting. Since the entirety of the game takes place on an Ork ship with average to low level lighting, gun muzzle flashes are prominent, and for some reason I found it particularly wonderful to be bathed in bright bursts while in a dark room.\n\nThe game is fun, and when it works, it WORKS. It does a magnificent job of making you feel like a badass. However....\n\nNEGATIVE:\n\n...When it doesn't work, it really seriously doesn't work. The game is obviously made for group multiplayer (up to four at once), and the classes you're given cover a particular concentration--focused fire, melee, etc. So if you're playing alone, you're going to experience some moments where you coast along without challenge, and some moments where you'll have to just try over and over until, by accident, you succeed. It can be really damn frustrating. For example, I played the entire game as a focused-fire class, and in one particular section I was on a lift shooting mines from far away. The challenge was trivial and almost boring because it was exactly my class' calling. But there are some set pieces where you're bombarded with one group of enemies after another, and it was the OPPOSITE of my class specialty. Some of these parts I had to play ten times, and the success was based on chance.\n\nSo in single player, the difficulty can range from trivial to unfairly scream-worthy. I'd guess with multiplayer it would be a lot of fun because your team would be more all-purpose, so I highly suggest playing only if you have friends.\n\nAlso, if you're not a big fan of Warhammer 40k, there's probably little this game would offer you since it does nothing to explain protagonists, antagonists, or setting whatsoever. It seriously just drops you in and lets you go.\n\nThis is neither positive or negative, but the game is awfully short. I've clocked three hours' play time and beat all five missions (each of which is about 20-40 minutes long). I say it isn't necessarily bad because there's much replay value here, especially with friends, and in that context sometimes it's nicer to play a shorter game you can finish in one sitting. You're given a level score, can obtain numerous upgrades and collectibles, and play through each level as one of the four classes, for a total of four different jaunts through each mission, so as a completionist you're looking at closer to 12 hours. Plus as a multiplayer game it probably rocks. Not too bad, considering this game is only $10, usually far less during sales.\n\nOverall I'd recommend this game, especially to die-hard fans of Warhammer 40k. Just be prepared to have a less-than-perfect experience. But when this game works...damn does it work.","May 20","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
