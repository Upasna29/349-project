You can make a shooter in minutes and you can expand it with extra model packs."\nSo estimated development time: 1-3 weeks.\n\nWhen I mentioned that they made SECTOR with FPS creator in steam discussions, they immediately deleted it. While threads that directly insult the developer or called his game ♥♥♥♥ remains intact (which is a good thing). Thankfully they can't delete reviews.\n\nI promised the developer to make a walkthrough video of his game because there were no gameplay videos or let's plays of his game. And the official trailer was bad with huge ACTION! watermark on it (the trailer has been removed). So he provided me a steam key of his game.\n\nSECTOR is a hard game. Enemies have pin-point accuracy, sometimes they get bugged and shoot rapidly which causes immediate death. SECTOR does not have auto-save, so you have to save manually. Sometimes there will be locked doors and you have to literally search every corner of the room in-order to find it, key searching will eat most of your time. SECTOR does not have any graphics options, so if you get FPS drops then tough luck. Sometimes when you load a save, you will immediately die on spawn for no reason, that means you have to use an older save. If you managed to reach as far as me (level 5) then this is your dead-end. "Crates and barrels puzzle" part cannot be completed because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ FPSC physics engine. In other FPSC games, they only stick to 3 crates stacking, even 3 crates stacking is buggy, but still manageable. I contacted the developer about this part hoping that he replaces it with a simple stair or elevator, here is his response:\nOriginally posted by Airys Software:Hello,\nFirst, thanks a lot !\nOur team didn't find any problem with Crates and barrels puzzle, we solved all the puzzles, they are hard but not impossible, that is sure we finished the game a lot of times to test it.\nThanks.""They are hard but not impossible"; the YouTube video proves otherwise.\n\nI played a lot of FPS creator games and made some myself. SECTOR is entry-level FPSC game with a price tag slapped on it. SECTOR costed $5 at first, but they raised the price to $7.99 and then put it on "sale" with 10% off.\n\nCONCLUSION: Bad buggy game made by lazy developer using easy game maker (level editor).","July 11, 2015","false","1.5"," 239 of 256 people (93%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","93","239","256","13","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/366960/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","SECTOR is apparently a FPS game that was released in mid 2015 from the folks at UD and published by Airys Software. After enjoying some hate and low sales, as well as publishers not being able to contact developers for some reason, it went Free To Play at early 2016. At least from what I understand. It was a game that got through Steam Greenlight and from what I heard uses FPS Creator engine and some assets. Well, that sure isn't a good start.\n\nTechnically, it's pure awfulness. No options. Never save while forced to crouch. You will get stuck. It will crash on loading. Keep few saves, sometimes you die by loading some savepoints. And look, this game is a glitch, so.\n\nUpon learning that this game had only 9 levels, I started my quest by launching the game. Immeditly I was thrown into main menu, which had only New Game, Loading and Quit Game. No Options. Ever. Some ambient generator sound that looped horribly was playing. I clicked New Game and was thrown into first level. No plot. No music. No explanations. Dark. This world is dead. Level 1.\n\nAfter walking through two big rooms, last one having skeleton resting against pipe, I picked up key without noticing it by just wandering around. As I would later find out, keys in general are black tiny pieces of turd that are almost impossible to see with the Doom-3-made-awful lighting that this game has. They are sure to be pain to find. After that, opening door with ENTER, I picked up pistol and in next big room I got to fight a single enemy.\n\nWhere I found out that combat in this game sucks. Your movement is clunky, the weapons are clunky, enemies are 100% accurate hitscan shooters who just charge at you. And they are clunky. And have no painstates. It's as primitive and unfun as it gets. There also was random NPC who had enemy skin on him, just standing there and shaking head in disbilief.\n\nOn level 2, having solved the puzzle-thing and crawling through the overly long shaft because staring at wall texture for minute is fun, I got out into room, with new sucky weapons. There were more enemies, shooting and skeletons. This is where I found out that you can lean around with Q and E. Or more exactly that most enemies don't awake if you lean around corner and shoot them, which is the way I beat most of the game without pain.\n\nUntil I went to level 3 and game crashed there. Sighing, I reloaded my save and sighed again, as I found myself outside of level geometry with no way in. Never save in shafts.\n\nLevel 3 was funky. One of the soldiers didn't attack me and instead yelled at my something like a commander when I came close. He was too adorable to shoot at in this dead world. I didn't find key, but I found place where I managed to activate switch through the wall. Or ceiling. I don't know by now. By the end of level I found a skeleton. Mr. Skeleton got tired of acting dead in this game. He was standing and chilling like NPC, his favourite drink was placed on a pipe nearby. Even he didn't care about this game anymore. He was drunk.\n\nI don't remember where, but in level 3 or 4 I found shotgun. It's the only good weapon because it either kills instantly or at least knocks them back, stunning for a bit. It's also the only weapon where iron sight works, as it tightens the arc at which pellet spread up, defying the real life logic.\n\nLevel 4 had rooms with open ceiling, you could see the sky there. But it was grey, flat and the base was as dark as ever even under the sky. The whole universe was dead and had no soul. There was a room with BSOD computer, broom. It was room with open ceiling too, with useless air shaft nearby. I also saw stairs that I couldn't reach above. As it would later turn out, devs wanted me to build stairs out of wooden boxes, but I already destroyed them all. Never destroy boxes, they hold nothing. Thankfully, engine's player movement sucked and I was able to get there by ramming and jumping nearby fence.\n\nLevel 5 had water. And green light. And no one to listen to your whines. This is where I researched and found a way to grab boxes in FPS Creator engine. Right mouse click works, but you have to "pull away" weapon by pressing same slot number. Weapon will remain, but it will show "0/0" ammo. If you don't do it, then you can still hold the objects but game will glitch out and you will not be able to switch weapons. One reviewer said that it's impossible to get out from water. But with my experience of awful game, I bet on the awful player physics again and succeed by placing three boxes in corner of a room and spammed the jump button while ramming them.\n\nLevel 6 and level 7 mixed around in my memory. There was nothing good to talk about. Or nothing special. My brain already wants to block this. But I think that there was lab theme and skeletons. In one of them there was a shaft almost-maze section. And one of the side dead ends there had a skeleton with red lamp between his lovely legs. Upon recognising my body, I went to check if he has something and I got pushed on top of level geometry of the shaft by his collision. Thanks again, Mr Skeleton.\n\nLevel 8 was hospital-lab themed. There was a real human corpse on a single sit. Wandering more, I found a corridor. It wasn't textured like sci-fi. Instead it was more like a dungeon. I had a bad feeling about it. In next turn there was torture room, as evidenced by torture chair, human corpses hanging off the ceiling and skeleton in corner. I grabbed key, wondering what the game might show next, if it could go horribly wrong. A teleporter was awaiting me at the end of a level.\n\nIn best tradition of creepypasta, level 9 loading crashed. Maybe it wanted to keep me away from the horrible secret of the final level. But my curiousity got the best of me as I loaded it once again.\nThere was something behind me.\nYep, there certanly were two boxes stacked on top of each other behind me. It was both a sign and a warning.\n\nAnd indeed, I kept meeting the boxes. And once I came to the big room it became clear that developers intented me to build boxes stairs to reach the second floor. Thankfully, I had experience of awful glitchy games and did it only with three boxes, placing two of them on top of climbable shelf thing.\n\nWell, bolloks!\nThe door needed key.\n\nAfter going down and finding key, I was less lucky at using same exploitish stairs, requiring me to do 30 loads of saved game as I kept ramming into boxes instead of jumping straight onto them.\n\nAfter that there was no horror hidden futher. Just same corridors with new boring base textures. More enemies. At the end there was the last room. It had a sci-fi pedestal thing and there was spherical artifact placed on it. Neat asset. Was it the reward for our quest? I grabbed the item. Nothing happened. Then I went futher and the door in the middle turned out to be the exit.\n\nThere was a single splash screen with "Game Completed" message. Background was just another futurustic wall, no skeletons. As soundtrack you had another, even more awful generator sound.\n\nWell, it sure was just like "classic hardcore shooter" as promised store page. Exactly how I remember Doom and Quake.\nNow that I placed the order in that world, it's my turn to leave this game along with Mr Skeleton.\n\nOr don't know, I beat the game so I could write this masterwreck. Read this and stuff this cashgrab game somewhere deep. It's awful.

Instead of music you get to listen to a loop of a robotic cat purring.\n\nClick New Game.\n\nYou start out in a dimly lit hallway. There is no introduction or tutorial or even bubble tips. Use WASD to walk around, only to discover you're some deformed bipedal creature (Dimitri according to the game description) with a severe limp (judging by the highly irregular footsteps) and probably a large hump on your shoulder, I imagine. Anyway, you walk through the hallway and come upon a large room, empty aside from a large box. Then you come upon another empty room, another hallway, and more empty rooms and hallways. In each one, someone has methodically lifted the floor tiles in the same pattern.\n\nFinally you come to a room with several doors. You can't open any of them, I tried literally every key on the keyboard. I did discover some new moves, though. With Q and E you can snap your head from side to side at horrifying speeds, and with C you can instantly drop your head on the floor. Neat. The , and . buttons also adjust the gamma from lighting glitch to full sunlight radiating from the closed doors, with film noir somewhere in between.\n\nAfter being frustrated by trying to open these doors, you move on through the hallway only to find another door. Upon approaching this one you are given a tip that the door is locked and you need a key to open it. I can only assume this is the end of the game and that I have won, as there is literally nothing else I can do. I rock at FPS games and I have placed the order on the earth.

When I got to Level 4, I found that the key I collected doesn't open any door or passage.  I got so frustrated at this game, that I developed a splitting headache by the end of my playthrough.  I played about 2 hours over the course of yesterday and today.  I played as much as I could complete and as much as I could stand.  Let's get into some details.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty generic, almost boring at times.  It feels slow and sluggish, even though you can "run".  The enemies in this game are much too difficult for this kind of game; they're sparse, but they're too accurate and too powerful.  I think the reason is because the developers didn't know how to make proper enemy AI that's neither overpowering nor simple-minded.\n\nThe gun selection is standard for a game like this.  Most of the weapons were pretty tough to use because most of them were pretty ineffectual.  The shotgun was the only weapon that was decent.  However, there are a lot of problems with the gun mechanics.  For example, there's a delay with switching guns.  Also, you can only switch guns while standing still.  However, I think the biggest problem is the ability to remove your ammo.  This function has no purpose, at least in the part of the game I played.  I don't know if this is a mechanic for another part of the game or a half-♥♥♥♥♥ mechanic the developers never finished or even implemented.  All I know is that it's a completely useless "feature".  On a side note, everytime I would restart the game and reload my save, I would find a couple of ammo clips that reloaded near dead enemies.  I didn't complain, since I needed all of the ammo I could get, but in a good game, this would be considered a flaw in its coding.\n\nMost of the controls were fine.  However, this isn't without its problems, either.  Some of the controls felt sticky and unresponsive.  Also, you don't have the ability to customize your controls.  Sometimes, this is fine, but for a game like this, I expect an option for custom controls.\n\nThe graphics weren't that bad.  Actually, the game looked alright.  The textures reminded me of Quake 2, which is a much better game than this.  Of course, this game can't go without problems in every department.  The texture and color choices for many parts of the game were abysmal.  Making the keys and floors a similar texture and color didn't help me get through the levels.  It also didn't help that the lighting only worked properly some of the time.  However, the models looked pretty good.  In fact, some of the design choices were aesthetically pleasing.  This game also had moving skeletons, which is always a plus.\n\nI haven't even talked about the worst part of this game: the level design.  Starting a new game or a saved game was pretty simple.  Getting there took a seemingly inordinate amount of time.  When the game finally loaded, what did I get?  Floating guns, walls that I could go through, missing ceilings, etc.  It's not like this game was loading a lot of assets.  The levels are insultingly basic: boxes strung together by hallways.  This is amateur stuff.  Sure, there were a couple of halfway decent designs, like a stairway that wrapped around the room, but this design is thrown out the window when you have a stairway that's not complete and stops short of where you need to go.  This actually happened.  I couldn't complete this game because of this major design flaw.  It was such a tease.  It's as if the developers didn't test this game and wanted to ♥♥♥♥ it out of their asses as quickly as possible, so that they could get money as quickly as possible.  Doors in this game worked only if their properties were loaded in correctly.  At one point in the game, I thought you had to jump onto a chair and glitch through the ceiling in order to progress.  It turns out, there was a key hidden behind a couple of computer console assets in a space I thought you couldn't get through.  The only way to get this key is by accidently walking over to this area and grabbing the key.  Actually, I think that's how I got every single key in this game: by sheer luck and by total accident.  What a load of ♥♥♥♥ing garbage.  Getting lost in this game is probably what compounded the headache I got while playing this stupid game.\n\nThe physics in this game were pretty much ♥♥♥♥.  Everything wants to stick to the nearest surface, as if everything is made of ♥♥♥♥ing magnets.  Quake 2 had better physics than this game, and that was from 1997.  The difference is that Quake 2 was made by people who actually gave a ♥♥♥♥ about their product.\n\nThe best thing about this game is probably the sound.  The ambiance was pretty chilling.  It reminded me of Quake 2.  Do you get the idea yet?  This game seems like it ripped off Quake 2, but did a really ♥♥♥♥ job at it.  The music that played in the background was decent, but it took me out of what little immersion this game put me into.  In other words, it was kinda out of place.  One thing that bothered me a lot was with the iron sights of the guns.  For example, when I used the iron sights for the water gun toy (the laser pistol), I would hear a mechanical moving sound.  Why?  Unless I'm a robot or unless there's a groan tube in my gun, that noise shouldn't be made.  This little tidbit sounds like me nitpicking, but it was something that bothered me.  In fact, it bothered me more than a lot of the other problems in\nthis game.\n\nThis was a terrible game and a boring experience.  This is an ambitious first game that someone would post on IndieDB for FREE.  This isn't something you would expect people to pay 5 ♥♥♥♥ING DOLLARS FOR.  Luckily, much like the Grinch, the developers developed a heart and made this game free about a month before the writing of this review.  However, this doesn't justify the lack of quality put into this piece of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThis is reccommended only to people who have a thing for ♥♥♥♥ games, just like how there are people who have a thing for ♥♥♥♥ movies.  Also, a final word to the developers: if you're going to have multiple save spaces for your game, test your game and make sure you can complete it with the least amount of problems as possible.  Shadow Warrior (1997) was a game where you likely had to use multiple save states for the extra tricky parts.  The difference is that Shadow Warrior was a classic, whereas this game was complete drivel and utter dogshit.","February 26","false","2.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Pretty much just like HOuston we have a problem. 4.99 is not even worth it. The game is made with the old fps creator. Most creators who used that program, they mainly gave the game out for free to anyone, due to the fps creator was an easy thing to use. All assets i can remember is on this game. Nothing has changed. The gameplay lacks in so much, The game doesnt act like a classic game. Many bugs, ai are terrible, pathetic sounds effects, no options, and annoying bugs\n\nPros\nNONE\n\nCons\nAi are bad\nsound effects are just bad\nBugs (loading a save gun you lose your weapons, cant pick up items such as some keys sometimes, ai gets stuck)\nNo trading cards nor achievements\nNo options- cant change resolution/sound","October 8, 2015","false","0.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I think it could have had a lot of potential, I really like the enemy models and the futuristic atmosphere, it almost feels like it kind of has an unreal tournament vibe to it. I honestly wish I could like this game more but I can't, simply because its so broken. I really do mean it when I say I want to like it and enjoy it but I just can't, the controls are too confusing, as are the puzzles, the enemies are buggy, you cant switch weapons if your moving and when I do switch weapons its like I have more than one gun in my inventory without any ammo, so you have to keep flipping through your guns. I could go on but I think me and everyone else has already said it. Unless this game has a huge update to it that fixes everything, I strongly suggest you dont get this game, even if its free, its a waste of time and space on your computer.","March 7","false","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

People actually paid for this? Seriously? First of all the menu is a mess, options are mislabeled. I spent a few minutes at the menu screen because I didn't realize that the miscolored "loading" label actually meant "load game". No options either, no help, more importantly NO KEYBINDING INFO. I couldn't figure out what the "use" key was. This along with no feedback makes it impossible to tell what key does what. I stood in front of a door hitting each key to figure out what the "use" key was with no effect. Took a while to realize that it was an unopenable door that didn't react. Helpfully the "press enter to use" subtitle came up, after you had to hit enter to progress to that stage. Animations are nonexistant. It's like no effort was put into actually playing the game before releasing it.\n\ntl;dr It's like what I would expect from someone who ran through a Unity tutorial, not something on Steam.","March 29","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
