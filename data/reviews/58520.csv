ARE YOU READY FOR ANOTHER SKULL-SPLITTING, BONE-CRUSHING GOOD TIME?"\n\nAh, what fun it is to play the good ol' Blood Bowl! I used to play the tabletop version and fell in love. This version has all the charm (and frustration) of American football gone medieval, the best strategies lain waste to bad dice rolls, and multiple races with all the expected strengths and weakness common with Warhammer fantasy. The upgraded commentary from our two favorite Blood Bowl aficionados, Jim (Vampire) and Bob (Ogre), keep a smile on your face with every result... even the ones that go against you. The rulebook is also included from the tabletop version to define everything you need to know about the game.\n\nI prefer playing the turn-based "Blitz" mode, which allows for some customization of your teams, players, and adds additional flavor of spells, crowds and riot-causing fans, as well as player equipment (upgraded helmets, pads, etc which add to your abilities), bribing the ref, and many more. I love to win and hate to lose because this game make you sweat for every inch of the Pitch (playing field)!\n\nFor the first time player, tutorials are included. The game is easy to learn but does have some complexion in the variety of rules to be tracked. I recommend to put it on easy mode and play a couple games to get the hang of it after you do the tutorials.\n\nMultiplayer mode is also available and I use it! My friends who play with me love to rant and rave about the worst roll or that last second catch at the end of the match that scored the game-winning touchdown!\n\nWARNING! This game will test your frustration limits! I mean, COME ON!, how does a strength 2 halfling charge a strength 6 minotaur and KO him!?? WTH, man!? LOL!\n\nAgain, I loved it back in the 80's when I originally played it tabletop, and this brings back all the fun! It did so well that it received a go at "Blood Bowl 2"!","June 27, 2014","true","3.3"," 37 of 44 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","37","44","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/58520/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","American Football meets Warhammer is probably the best way to describe Cyanide Studio's sporting epic called Blood Bowl which throws gamers into this deadly universe. Apart from sporting and a healthy dose of violence, there is even some RPG and management aspects added to the game to keep things quite original and fresh. Throwing together a variety of characters from the world of Warhammer, gamers can now experience a sporting game with a difference as Orcs, Humans, Goblins and the like all fight for victory on the field and although these games were quite popular in the yesteryear of gaming, it's great to see a developer run with the idea again.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Blood Bowl Legendary Edition is not your traditional sports game but you’ve probably guessed that already. As opposed to the console sport games, this title is a turn based strategy. The biggest change to this edition as opposed to previous games is that the developers have included a variety of new races into the mix such as High Elves and the Undead. Elves can also "glamour" their foes which does allow you to control them. The secret is 11 new playable races! Then you have the streamlined online play that actually makes it more fun to play it online as opposed to single-player. The only issues with online is trying to find another player and with offline, the AI is a little less than challenging.\n\nIf you haven’t played the board game or the previous  PC game, I thoroughly recommend that you follow every step of the tutorial because as opposed to American Football, there are quite a few tweaks and changes to be found. From kicks to tackles and dodging, the learning curve of this title, especially if you are unfamiliar with American Football or rugby to an extent is quite high. Things become even more challenging with the inclusion of Blood Bowl rules.\n\nOnce you have completed the tutorial, the story mode is probably the best place to start which allows you to put your skills into action…slowly. In this mode, you play a mercenary trainer or "coach" for your selected race,as you play a variety of games. Another fun mode is the campaign mode which offers you a plethora of levels or games to play but offers some unlockable content as you gain new powers and players.\n\nHowever the star of the title is playing the game online as you engage in a variety of matches and leagues. There is a new commissioner tool that has been added into the game. This gives the owner of a particular league, some power in terms of resetting matches or replays. This is how Blood Bowl should be played. Just be warned that dying sucks...  especially when one of your stars decided to take a dirt nap from getting killed by an opponent or opponent. Or those pesky vampires that get blood lust and wish to feed on not only their opponents but also the fans!\n\nDespite some flaky matchmaking and an apparent ability for less scrupulous players to 'predict' incoming dice rolls, online play in Blood Bowl is still a whole lot of fun. Custom leagues exist for those of you that want to dodge the minefield of random play, with a thriving community dedicated to providing decent opposition and eradicating the sort of rage-quitting and general idiocy that unfortunately rears its head during regular play with strangers.\n\nAlso it's worth noting that due to the hugely expanded roster the Legendary Edition remains very much open to questions of imbalance, but in part that's simply a design choice. Choosing a smaller team such as the Halflings will never give you a fair crack at winning, but including the weaker races will placate a large section of the audience that wants an authentic experience and a distinct challenge for veterans. Yes it's disappointing to see a bewildering lack of instruction to new players on how to avoid the more obvious mismatches, but you get the feeling that developer Cyanide rarely took their eyes off developing a title that served the old guard first and foremost - the type of people that will be only too happy to have a large range of playable races and head into every game fully prepared for the likely challenge of encountering each.\n\nThe graphics mirror the board game perfectly and all the characters look like their real-world miniature painted figures. The animation is good as are the stadium backgrounds and special effects. It’s funny seeing these mythical creatures compete in a sport game similar to American Football with its all regalia. The stadiums look pretty cool as well and there around 10 new areas for you to compete in. The soundtrack with its rock inspired mythic focus suits the game well as do the sound effects. Overall, it’s a good looking game, especially on high detail.\n\nSo do I recommend this game? If you’re a fan of Blood Bowl, than you’ve come to the right place but just be warned that online play is a must. Sports fans would probably be annoyed due to the limited control of the players but once again this game is a strategy not an arcade sports title.","March 9","true","101.2"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","17","17","2","0"

Many things do come down to random chance, but the goal is to ensure that you take chances in your favour to give yourself the best possible chance of success. Eventually all your players will die, you will lose the ball in the most random/unpredictable way and you with hang your head.\n\nNo the dice are not stacked against you, and your not going to win every game.

It is essentially what happens when you take (American) football and set it in the Warhammer universe. For those who don't know American football, players take a ball and try to run it into the opponent's endzone, at the other side of the field.\nThis scores them a point, and whoever has the most points at the end of the match wins.\nUnique to Bloodbowl, however, is that it's heavier on the action. Orks don't particularly enjoy making a run with the ball to see if they can score that way. They'll just get together and try to punch their way through the opponent's lines. And this can lead to injuries or even deaths on both sides.\n\nAlso different from the physical sport is that this is mainly turn based(A real-time mode exists too, if you prefer that). Players take turns moving their players and performing actions. It is surprisingly strategic and you need to think about your moves. You can do a lot of risky things, but your turn ends immediately if things go too wrong. If your players go down, if you fail to pick up the (Often slippery) ball, you score a point or you run out of time to make your moves - That's the end of your turn. This, combined with the chance based mechanics (It is based off a boardgame, dice are involved in pretty much all actions) and a critical success and failure system means that anything is possible. You can come back from the worst of positions, and you can always end up losing from the best of positions, but there is skill to be found here other than just random luck.\n\nSkill, and strategy in Bloodbowl is not twitch based, build orders, or micromanagement. Instead of that, It's your risk management. If you can position your players so that they force your opponent to take risks, then it is likely that he will at some point fail at it. And then you can come in, get the ball loose, and try to score. If you do not know how to attack the opponent's defensive formation without taking unnecessary risks, you'll end up with players laying down and the opponent stealing the ball away from you.\nThe lack of 100% winning strategies, and chance based things mean that every match is different, and as such it has great replayability, variety, and new situations almost every time you play, while the online play, private leagues, and team progression means you will be able to play a long time without getting bored.\n\nWhen things go well, and your worst player slaps down an ogre? Praise Nuffle!\nWhen your elf catcher trips on his own shoelaces and breaks his neck? Praise Nuffle!\nThe end result of a match isn't the goal you're playing for. It's the journey there - If you don't take it too seriously you'll be able to enjoy this game, but if you can't stand bad luck where you can just roll critical failures every turn? It might just be frustrating then.\n\nFor fans of games that do things differently, or just fans of boardgames, I can recommend this. And if you're wondering about Legendary and Chaos edition then don't worry. They're compatible with eachother. You'll be able to play with people who own the other version too","December 3, 2014","true","107.9"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","16","19","5","0"

With that in mind, I bought the legendary edition for full price, thinking I could upgrade to the chaos edition after I learned how to play. That was yesterday. Well, today, the Chaos edition went on sale for $12 for the next 4 months. How positively unfortunate.\n\nWell, for those of you looking for more info and less facepalm, the game is a blast...so far. I jumped straight into an offline campaign (classic mode, hard difficulty). I've only played the first 2 games, but they were both nail-biting, edge-of-my-seat fun. I won both games (first one came down to the last 2 turns, second one was much easier). I'm sure the competition will get harder as all our teams level up.\n\nI noticed in the reviews people complaining about the RNG, claiming it's all dumb luck; after watching several games and playing 2 myself, this really isn't as bad as they make it out to be in my opinion. Look at all your options each turn, take the low-risk actions first, then go for the high risk actions at the end of your turn (or don't even take the high-risk actions if you don't need to). It's a strategy game about risk management, not a blind RNG hack and slash. You really need to think things through, or you are really going to hate the game. Yes, there's dice, and yes, sometimes those dice will want to violate you. Painfully. But it IS within your power to severely effect the LIKELIHOOD of such events. I was able to end the bulk of my turns by clicking the "End of Turn" button rather than bad rolls. The few that were ended from bad rolls were mostly high risk actions that I knew full well ahead of time might end badly, and I was sure to take those actions last for that very reason.\n\nDuring the first game, I used up the full 4-minute time bank almost every turn to really look over my options. 4 minutes might seem like a lot, but when you are new to the game it goes by fast. At first I had trouble frantically trying to get through everything I wanted to before the time ran out. Fortunately, somewhere between the first and second game I started being able to regularly figure out my plans and execute them with a cool head and time to spare. It helped that I watched several pvp matches before I bought the game.\n\nI can't say much about the rest of the game (all the different team strategies, game modes, skills etc), as I haven't explored it all yet, but I can say with confidence, I most certainly will. I do know that every team plays different, and that the way you set up each team (funds, skills, roster, formations etc) makes them play vastly different as well. Those different possibilities coupled with the fact that there is RNG involved really means there are many different game experiences to be had, and I look forward to trying them out. I am very excited to add this game to my library and wear it out, even if I DID buy it for full price the DAY BEFORE IT WENT ON SALE FOR 60% OFF FOR THE NEXT 4 MONTHS!\n\nSheesh...\n\nJust gonna forget that happened. Eventually.\n\ntl;dr\n\nGame -> Good\nBuy.\nPlay.\nBe happy. Or infuriated due to dice rolls. But still somewhat kinda happy somewhere deep down.","February 3, 2015","true","8.9"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","12","14","4","0"

I still don't have the faintest clue what's going on.  Just for the hell of it, I played a match using the biggest handicap I could muster.  I was completely murdered.\n\nIf I had to guess, and at this point that's all I have, the problem is with the source material, not with the translation to a video game.

When your star player reaches level 5 when most other players in the league are 2 at most, you'll really learn what Blood Bowl is when you watch him die as the medics fail to revive him because an angry fan threw a rock at him.","March 4, 2014","true","137.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Yes, each race has positives and negatives, but if you play your cards (rolls) right, you can beat any team with any other team. If I were to compare its strategy to any sport I would say soccer with a small mix of football.

BB is one of the most well designed games ever produced by Games Workshop, and the classic timed *turn-based* computer version is a faithful emulation of the boardgame.  The game has three formats--the classic version of the game, the classic version with some additional rule variants and customization options (which can be fun), and the 'real-time' Blitz version.  Of the three versions, the most fun for me is the classic version with or without the variants.  I do not enjoy the Blitz version of the game at all.  Regardless, the title is worth owning.  For me, the replay value is very high and I especially enjoy playing against my son in multiplayer mode.","December 26, 2011","true","172.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And they don't pretend to hide it either. Basically the entire strategy of the portion is to limit the dice rolling to be in your favor as much as possible or to try and avoid it alltogether OR to stock up on rerolls. Now again, the game is pretty fun, when things work out in your favor. But it can be incredibly frustrating when playing a neck and neck match with someone and then losing your entire turn the first move because you failed a dice roll.\n\nThere's also some serious balancing issues with several races being incredibly worthless and a few being super powerful and still easy to play. Regardless, the game is an interesting take on a 'fantasy football' (Yes, that's what I'm going to call this) type of game with some amusing commentary... for the first 3 matches. For a game that's been rereleased a dozen times I'd expect it to be more polished, but if you want about a few hours of enjoyment from a unique turn based strategy game then you can't really go wrong here.\n\n7.4/10.","February 28, 2014","true","4.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Sadly, that is where the positives end. Given that they only really had to implement the rules of the table top game with some net code, I didn't think they could mess things up, but it really appears as though they did their best to give the user the very worst experience imaginable. It felt as though they put in very little effort from a UI perspective. No excuse for such a shoddy menu system in this day and age. The menus were slow and clunky and navigating between pre-match screens took overly long. Also, I found it impossible to set up a 1 off game with a friend over the net. The only clear way to play against each other was to set up a league and we weren't allowed to only have 2 teams in the league. Then, creating a custom team was a pain. When I finally gave up trying to play against a human opponent (which was the main reason I bought the game in the first place), I decided to play a match against the AI, so the game wouldn't have been a complete waste of money. The game and AI was very buggy. The game crashed multiple times and during 1 match, after a few turns, the opposing AI team failed to move a single player for 4 consecutive turns and for each of those turns I had to wait for the turn clock to run down so I could take my turn.

However, the amount of bugs has been (and remains) shocking and the game is currently unplayable - unless you're willing to ignore countless lost saves, stuck positions etc.\n\nJust to demonstrate: You've got ONE save per campaign which can last a hundred hours. You got no autosaves, meaning you REALLY got to think about saving. On balance, once in EVERY game you play, things (meaning engine/camera/technical sh*t, not your dice rolls) go t*ts up and you must quit and restart (losing an hour of gameplay at least, since you only can save at certain poitns). And you better pray you rememmer NOT to save before quitting, because otherwise you're saving the bug as well.\n\nResult: Unplayable.

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #26 - Blood Bowl: Legendary Edition\n\nI had heard of Blood Bowl, and knew it was based on a tabletop game, but otherwise I did not know anything about it.  So going in, I had no idea what to expect.\n\nSince I hadn't played before, I started with the tutorial, hoping it would help me understand how to play the game.  After waiting awhile for it to load (longer than I would have expected), it opens with a pair of commentators to explain the rules of the game, with some groan-worthy humor thrown in.\n\nThe tutorial starts out simple enough by explaining the basic camera controls, and how to change cameras.  Then it covers "tackle zones" and placing your teams starting positions for the kick off.  It also explains the concept of re-rolls, which allow you to re-roll a die result, with each team only getting a limited number of these.\n\nBut things quickly get complicated once the actual gameplay starts.  The game is filled with all of these different skills that players can have.  Each skill acts as a conditional modifier, depending on the situation.  For example, when picking up the ball, the game will "roll a die" and if the roll is too low, then you'll fail to pick up the ball.  But, if your player has the "Sure Hands" skill, then the player gets a second roll when the first one fails.\n\nIt seems that pretty much every action in the game has one of these skills associated with it.  If I try to pass the ball, there's a 'Pass' skill that lets you re-roll a failed roll.  The game also starts talking about stats like Agility, and some kind of "Agility Table" that is used for skill checks, but apparently you have to read the rules to see that.\n\nNext the tutorial moves onto blocking and pushing past defenders.  Now even more skill checks are coming into play.  Here the roll is based on the Strength stat, and not only are there skills for influencing the block result, but also whether or not players get injured or not.\n\nAs the tutorial continues into movement, dodging and blitzing, and even more die rolls and skills, I can feel my eyes starting to glaze over.   By the time the tutorial gets to the first turnover, I am pretty much lost.  I'm just kind of reading and nodding along at this point.\n\nJust to give an idea of how quickly the tutorial starts piling on skills, here's one of the things it tries to explain to me:  "Since Krug Painspear has the tackle skill, Jean-Paul mussen is knocked down with a 'Defender Stumbles', even though he has the Dodge skill, which would normally allow him to regard that as a simple push-back."\n\nThe commentators swear that although it sounds complicated, it's all really easy after a few games.  I'm not so sure.  I'm reminded of this episode of Star Trek where Kirk has been captured by these gangsters, and he introduces them to a card game called Fizzbin.  Only the game doesn't exist, and Kirk is making up the rules as he goes, and the gangsters are completely confused as Kirk tries to explain the game.  That's exactly how I felt after finishing the tutorial.\n\nSo clearly there is a learning curve here.  So it comes down to whether or not it's worth spending the time to learn the game.  If you are a fan of the board game, then it seems pretty obvious you'll enjoy this as well.    If you like tabletop war games in general, and aren't intimidated by rules, then it's also likely you'll enjoy this.  But if you are more of a casual player, then this game will likely go right over your head as it did mine.","July 29, 2015","false","1.2"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

It is not, however, a football game with a fantasy setting; and it is this point that frustrated me the most. As someone who had not played the table-top game before, much less possessed any skill at it, I found making effective use of the mechanics in this game hard and the results were disappointing due to the very steep learning curve; successes were rare and offset by the frustrating ease with which failure occurred for even the simplest of tasks, and with little in-game guidance it was very difficult to even grasp at what I was doing wrong. What I have since learned is that this is not really a game about strategy with random elements, but rather ongoing mitigation of the high randomness that occurs turn-to-turn; and that just rubs me the wrong way.\n\nIf you enjoy the table-top Blood Bowl game and/or you are very familiar with its rules, you'll probably enjoy this game. If not, this is likely to leave you just as frustrated as it left me; save your money for something else.","October 5, 2014","false","52.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

While the controls are intuitive and the rules make sense after a period of play the lackluster AI is bolstered by horribly pre-scripted success chances. While theoretically the AI rolls the chance dice as well they almost never suffer failure despite long odds. Wild examples include being able to dodge around 3 defenders simultaneously and throwing the ball the entire length of the field multiple times with no failures. Couple that with key moments of "bad luck" for your team at crucial points (bad dice rolls that result in your team dropping the ball right before putting it in the end zone, failed re-rolls, missed blocks and dodges, etc.) and you have a recipe for consistent frustration.","December 7, 2014","false","3.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I just thought I'd precursor saying that, because with that in mind - this is without a doubt, one of THE WORST GAMES I have EVER had the unfortunate displeasure of playing in my entire life.  I had seen some generally unfavorable reviews of the game but ignored them for the most part because I figure the general public usually wouldn't like a niche game like this.  I should have listened to them, and you should listen to me if you don't want to make the mistake of throwing your money toward one of the most unenjoyable trash games ever to be created.\n\nI don't even know where to begin.  Forget the steep learning curve of the game.  You can learn everything there is to learn about this game and it still won't be fun.  Unless you find having a guy who's wide open 2 squares away unguarded from an unguarded passer both with a "passer" skill and the receiver with a "cather" skill and still having the ball fall to the ground, ending your turn (because anytime you have something go "wrong" in this game, your entire turn ends.  Fun huh?)  then witnessing the enemy come up, pick up the ball, run through your entire defense and not get taken down at all and score at will - fun!\n\nIf you like watching a ball get kicked off right to the ground beside your receiver who has "sure hands" skill, and still watching them try to pick up a ball and have it fumble off and end your turn again, then watch the enemy just jump through your defense and pick up the ball before you can even pick it up as you fumble turn after turn after turn in this awful sorry excuse for a game.\n\nGot a player that you really enjoyed having on your team?  Spent money on the "apothecary" (which is basically suppose to be something that prevents 1 injury to a player per game, of which there will be many) so you don't want your favorite star player to die and be gone forever?  Oh dont' worry, it won't do you any good.  I've played probably around 50 games and not ONCE has the apothecary ever worked when trying to heal someone.\n\nDo you enjoy using tactics and strategy to win games?  Then this is not the game for you.  Do you enjoy having literally every simple stupid thing chocked up to the luck of a 6 sided die, that mysteriously the AI will always have go their way and you never will?  This is the game for you then.\n\nDo you enjoy halftime periods that are so awkwardly timed that any chance at having an exciting end to a game or half will without fail ALWAYS end before you can actually have... you know.. FUN at a game, and instead just end up thoroughly disappointed because you never get to witness anything awesome in this game?  This game is also right up your alley then.\n\nDo you enjoy having every little thing chocked up to D6 rolls, even the winnings when you actually are so fortunate to have won a game, your level ups when your players are lucky enough not to have died on the field or had a game ending injury, or literally every single kickoff of the game having some random event sway the game in your opponents favor, even if you have all the "stats" such as twice as many cheerleaders as the opponent and twice as many assistant coaches?  Once again, I've got a game for you - Blood Bowl, Legendary Edition\n\nThe only thing Legendary about this game is how awful it is.  There is ZERO fun to be had in this game, only frustration pain and suffering.  May the developers of this game be ashamed to have ever put something this god awful out on the market and actually profit from it.  Such a cool concept for a game, hopefully someone else will attempt to make similar games.  Without a doubt it wouldn't be hard at all to top this gutter trash of a game.\n\n0/10, there is literally NOTHING redeemable about this game.  At least most awful games can have something good said about this, but not this one.  Avoid this game, no matter who you are, unless you are a masochist.","March 15, 2014","false","10.8"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

Recimo jedan scenarij: kaos protiv wood elfova. Kaos je moja ekipa. Ja sam kiker i super opalim loptu ode na suprotni kraj terena od onog koj sam naciljao ali nema veze to je tak svejedno kuda lopta ode, pripisujem to šlampavosti mojeg kikera. i sad njegov wood elfe hvata loptu bezprjekorno i preće u marš na tuch down. meni u prvoj sekundi onesvjeste minotaura i još jedno od opakijih tipova. Ok nema veze pošaljem 4 obrambena igrača na napadača i napadač mi s jednim udarcem sruši 2 od moja 4 obrambena igrača. ostala dvojca ga dovoljno zadržavaju da dođe jos 4 mojih igrača minotar se osvjestio. Padaju još dva moja igrača od strane istog napadačkog igrača. Minotaur dolazi u bitku njegov napadač je sada okružen sa 6 mojih igrača od čega ih je 3 u nesvjesti, a jedan je minotaur. napadač udara mog minotaura i zadaje mu teške ozljede da nemože igrati do kraja utakmice. nakon 2 minute intenzivnog mlačenja napokon uspijem rušiti napadača. Pošaljem svojeg napadača po loptu. isklizne mu iz ruku, pošaljem opet, izklizne mu iz ruku. sada je več prošlo 20 sekundi hvatanja lopte po terenu sakupilo se 4 protivnička igrača oko mojeg bjednog jednog kada je uspio uhvatiti loptu. Brzo loptu šalem preko da izbjegnem napad protivnika. lopta uspješno poslana protivnik ne presjeca loptu.... lopta mojem igraču koj ju hvata ispada iz ruku. prošlo je 15 sekundi dok je moj igrač podignuo loptu s poda svi protivnici več e okupljaju oko njega. pokušavam dodati loptu kada mi ispada iz ruku. Ponovo pokušavam podignuti loptu nakon 5 neuspjelog pokušaja, lopta odlazi protivniku pod noge, on ju iz prve podiže napravi uspješno dodavanje, njegov suigrač besprjekorno hvata loptu ja šaljem svoju vojsku na njega (kažem vojsku jer šaljem 6 igrača). prvi pada gotovo u sekundi drugi se drži neko vrijeme no on isto pada. nakon pol minute borbe mojh 6 igrača ruši njegovog jednong nakon što ih je meni palo 4. napokon trčim u napad. Prvi obrambeni igrač protivnika ruši mog napadača u jednom hitcu, no mog napadača je pratilo 5 ljudi, tako da u roku od 40 sekundi uspjevam vratiti loptu na moju stranu, zapravo na pod gdje ostaje idučih 15 sekundi. Oke moj igrač napokon hvata loptu i trči prema liniji nakon što je njegovih 4 kolege onesvješteno i pada mrtav wood elfe ga je u jednom udarcu ubio dslovno ubio. super sada imam 9 od 11 igrača do kraja tekme jer mi je minotaur ozljeđen, a jedan igrač mrtav...... da ne opisujem dalje na kraju uspjevam protivnika dobiti sa 7/5 rezultatom (otkrio sam taktiku da ako sve igrače krečeš skupa ko hordu su jači i možeš čak doči do kraja).\n\nIgram 2 utakmicu i sve se ponavlja iz početka računalo pokazuje nadmoč no ja sa taktikom glavom kroz zid upjevam dobiti i drugu utakmicu u sezoni...\n\nZapočinjem 3 utakmicu sve isto komp vara  ja sve svoje držim na hrpi i ovaj put uspjevam izvuč cak 11/2 ostalo je svega 25 sekundi do kraja imam zagarantiranu pobjedu. No igrica je imala drugačiju viziju od mene, te se rušu 25 sekundi preije kraja tekme.\n\nPonovno palim igricu i idem loadat, kad shvatim da nisam saveao, a igrica nema auto save niti ga je moguče upaliti.\n\nSav moj trud je izgubljen i gubim volju za daljnjim igranjem ove igrice.","October 13, 2014","false","22.7"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

After the awful and uninformative tutorial I still had little of an idea how the game worked when I started a exhibition match. They went way overboard with the rules and overthought this game big time. All that happened when I tried to apply the tutorial rules in a exhibition match was I made two moves that I learned, the screen said "turnover", the enemy made about 15 moves, killed 3 of my guys and surrounded my guy that had the ball, then it was my turn, I tried to move my guy away from them, he fell down and died. I think it's something about roll modifiers and rolling a number higher than 3 and 4 to make handoffs and passes and blocks, but take that and complicate it with about five more layers of rules and you have this game.\nIt requires a load of rulebook reading since the tutorial didn't help with ♥♥♥♥. That's just what I want to do in my games: spend hours reading a rulebook. Even if I did learn it so what? This is just not a great game by any means, more clunky than anything.\n\nOne of the more nonsensical, unfun, unintuitive, uninformative tutorial, impossible to win games I've ever played. -300/10","December 11, 2013","false","0.5"," 3 of 15 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","3","15","0","0"

It ends up in an extremely onesided match - where more often than not the new player gets either mad and uses profanity or just leaves the game on - for you to wait for the timeout every turn.\n\nThe other problem is the huge percentage of games where the opponent just quit (without any significant penalty).\n\nThe game also had an weird priority in which races should be availeble first - but that is history now.\n\nI love Blood Bowl in all forms - so I really hope they overhall the commynitypart of the game - and creates something like divisions for coaches. So everybody has to play XXX amout of games in "the college divisions" before moving to the "NFL".\n\nThat would give everybody a better experiance - the new coaches would not be preyed upon - and it should result in a higher percentage of close matches.\n\n","December 26, 2014","false","247.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/recommended/58520/","djsoulfck","DJSF - off @ twitch.tv/sinlike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/","416 products in account","I have been a long-time fan of the Warhammer series and tabletop games, so Blood Bowl was an amazing addition to my library. The game also reminded me a lot of Deathrow, which I played to death on the original Xbox.\n\nIf you like the Warhammer series, dice-rolling mechanics (as seen in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Dragon Age series), turn-based (or real-time) strategy, football, and bloody, brutal mayhem, then you will enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are pretty good - there is a fair amount of detail put into the character models. There is not much customization for the different characters - you can change their colors and equip higher level equipement once they meet the reuirements (this takes a long time). The music and sound effects are great and add to the violent and competitive atmosphere.\n\nThe controls are not too complicated as you will mostly be using the mouse, however, the learning curve is moderate to difficult - especially if you are unfamiliar with dice-rolling being a core element of the game (it only uses 6-sided [d6] die vs. the 20-sided one used in other tabletop games like Dungeons & Dragons, so it isn't too complicated) and turn-based strategy games. There is a lot to take in, and playing through the tutorial is strongly advised, even if you are a veteran. Guides, walkthroughs, and wikis will help you out a lot if you get overwhelemed or lost, and I have used some beginner guides myself to determine which team to start off with. Try not to be too deterred by constant loses - your team will improve with experience and you will learn better strategies as you continue playing.\n\nYou can play a single football match, a campaign mode, or "story" mode, where you act as a coach for your team. Be advised, even on the easiest difficulty, the game has an absolutely brutal start. If you are used to playing sports games, you will understand that, as a new team, losing is completely normal (and expected). You can also choose to play in real-time vs. turn-based, and I would suggest turn-based to begin with. There is also an option for a quicker, playstyle or the original rules used in the actual tabletop Blood Bowl that the game is based off of.\n\nBefore you begin, you must select your team - each having distinct playstyles and different strengths/weaknesses. Many guides will recommend you play as the undead, as they are the most well-balanced team (especially in the beginning). Speedster teams like the Elves (and their variants) excel at dodging and run + gun strategies, however, you can easily be knocked out by stronger opponents. That being said, teams like the Ogres or Goblins risk being left in the dust of speedy opponents. Once you select your team, you will have a set amount of money to purchase players (having substitutions is very helpful and highly recommended), as well as other aids like coaches and cheerleaders (these provide a boost during turnovers).\n\nIn the pre-match screen, you are able to use pocket money to purchase buffs for yourself, or debuffs for your opponent. Examples include: a wizard who can "try" (again, success all depends on your dice roll) to damage the enemy team, potions to illegally enchance your players, or bribes to swing the referees' favor in your direction. You can also pay to have random tests on enemy players (they will be unable to play the match if they are caught using illegal enchancements), or purchase rioting fans that will attack any fans for the opposing team.\n\nDuring gameplay, you are able to move everyone on your team depending on their Movement Points. A critical mechanic to be aware of is how turnovers work: turns will automatically end if you fumble, fail to pick up the ball, or have one of your players knocked down (all of these conditions also apply during the AI's turn). This allows for very deep strategy, as it is sometimes more pertinent to have your defending player knock both him//herself and your opponent down to force a turnover (say, if your opponent is close to scoring a touchdown). Whenever you roll, you will be able to select 1 dice from your resulting roll, so attacking with players who have more die (3 instead of just 1) is highly advised. You can buy team rerolls that are extremely helpful (ex: if you are on offense and roll two "attacker downs," meaning you will have your player fall down and cause an immediate turnover, you can try to roll for better results). Most players will waste a turn to stand up (unless you have a "jump back" skill that allows you to move after standing up).\n\nThe strategy in the game is excellent, as can gain flanking bonuses, blitz once during your turn (otherwise, you can only attack if there is an enemy next to your player), and select different skills when your players level up. An example of a useful skill is "block," which allows a player to ignore a "both downed" dice result (only your opponent will be downed). If both the attack and defender have "block," then no one is downed and the turn continues. Positioning is integral to success in this game, as units cannot simply move away from other players' "tackle zones" - a dodge roll has to be issued to determine if the unit can successfully move away from a nearby player. Dodge rolls must be calculated for each unit that has a tackle zone aroun the moving character (so "caging," or trapping key players - like the ball carrier - is a viable strategy)\n\nGames last for 16 turns for each side (32 in total), and there is a timer during each turn so you cannot just idle around.\n\nI really enjoyed this game, but I must warn people that you may find the game too slow or too boring if you are not used to games that incorporate dice-rolling into everything. You could still try real-time mode instead, but be aware that you do not completely control the outcome of your actions - chance plays a heavy role in Blood Bowl.\n\nIf you like tabletop (especially dice) games, football, Warhammer, and strategy, and challenging AIs, then1 you should definitely give this game a try.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","August 15, 2014","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/recommended/58520/","djsoulfck","DJSF - off @ twitch.tv/sinlike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/","416 products in account","I have been a long-time fan of the Warhammer series and tabletop games, so Blood Bowl was an amazing addition to my library. The game also reminded me a lot of Deathrow, which I played to death on the original Xbox.\n\nIf you like the Warhammer series, dice-rolling mechanics (as seen in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Dragon Age series), turn-based (or real-time) strategy, football, and bloody, brutal mayhem, then you will enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are pretty good - there is a fair amount of detail put into the character models. There is not much customization for the different characters - you can change their colors and equip higher level equipement once they meet the reuirements (this takes a long time). The music and sound effects are great and add to the violent and competitive atmosphere.\n\nThe controls are not too complicated as you will mostly be using the mouse, however, the learning curve is moderate to difficult - especially if you are unfamiliar with dice-rolling being a core element of the game (it only uses 6-sided [d6] die vs. the 20-sided one used in other tabletop games like Dungeons & Dragons, so it isn't too complicated) and turn-based strategy games. There is a lot to take in, and playing through the tutorial is strongly advised, even if you are a veteran. Guides, walkthroughs, and wikis will help you out a lot if you get overwhelemed or lost, and I have used some beginner guides myself to determine which team to start off with. Try not to be too deterred by constant loses - your team will improve with experience and you will learn better strategies as you continue playing.\n\nYou can play a single football match, a campaign mode, or "story" mode, where you act as a coach for your team. Be advised, even on the easiest difficulty, the game has an absolutely brutal start. If you are used to playing sports games, you will understand that, as a new team, losing is completely normal (and expected). You can also choose to play in real-time vs. turn-based, and I would suggest turn-based to begin with. There is also an option for a quicker, playstyle or the original rules used in the actual tabletop Blood Bowl that the game is based off of.\n\nBefore you begin, you must select your team - each having distinct playstyles and different strengths/weaknesses. Many guides will recommend you play as the undead, as they are the most well-balanced team (especially in the beginning). Speedster teams like the Elves (and their variants) excel at dodging and run + gun strategies, however, you can easily be knocked out by stronger opponents. That being said, teams like the Ogres or Goblins risk being left in the dust of speedy opponents. Once you select your team, you will have a set amount of money to purchase players (having substitutions is very helpful and highly recommended), as well as other aids like coaches and cheerleaders (these provide a boost during turnovers).\n\nIn the pre-match screen, you are able to use pocket money to purchase buffs for yourself, or debuffs for your opponent. Examples include: a wizard who can "try" (again, success all depends on your dice roll) to damage the enemy team, potions to illegally enchance your players, or bribes to swing the referees' favor in your direction. You can also pay to have random tests on enemy players (they will be unable to play the match if they are caught using illegal enchancements), or purchase rioting fans that will attack any fans for the opposing team.\n\nDuring gameplay, you are able to move everyone on your team depending on their Movement Points. A critical mechanic to be aware of is how turnovers work: turns will automatically end if you fumble, fail to pick up the ball, or have one of your players knocked down (all of these conditions also apply during the AI's turn). This allows for very deep strategy, as it is sometimes more pertinent to have your defending player knock both him//herself and your opponent down to force a turnover (say, if your opponent is close to scoring a touchdown). Whenever you roll, you will be able to select 1 dice from your resulting roll, so attacking with players who have more die (3 instead of just 1) is highly advised. You can buy team rerolls that are extremely helpful (ex: if you are on offense and roll two "attacker downs," meaning you will have your player fall down and cause an immediate turnover, you can try to roll for better results). Most players will waste a turn to stand up (unless you have a "jump back" skill that allows you to move after standing up).\n\nThe strategy in the game is excellent, as can gain flanking bonuses, blitz once during your turn (otherwise, you can only attack if there is an enemy next to your player), and select different skills when your players level up. An example of a useful skill is "block," which allows a player to ignore a "both downed" dice result (only your opponent will be downed). If both the attack and defender have "block," then no one is downed and the turn continues. Positioning is integral to success in this game, as units cannot simply move away from other players' "tackle zones" - a dodge roll has to be issued to determine if the unit can successfully move away from a nearby player. Dodge rolls must be calculated for each unit that has a tackle zone aroun the moving character (so "caging," or trapping key players - like the ball carrier - is a viable strategy)\n\nGames last for 16 turns for each side (32 in total), and there is a timer during each turn so you cannot just idle around.\n\nI really enjoyed this game, but I must warn people that you may find the game too slow or too boring if you are not used to games that incorporate dice-rolling into everything. You could still try real-time mode instead, but be aware that you do not completely control the outcome of your actions - chance plays a heavy role in Blood Bowl.\n\nIf you like tabletop (especially dice) games, football, Warhammer, and strategy, and challenging AIs, then1 you should definitely give this game a try.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","August 15, 2014","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Blood Bowl takes a turn based approach to American Football and with the help of a unique roster of 20+ races and factions, turns it into a violent and chance based struggle to the endzone.

However, those that play and enjoy the game will learn and be able to do amazing things like kill the ball carrier, then retrieve the ball with another player, pass it to the team's star gutter runner (if you built a skaven team) and have him run all the way down the field dodging numerous defenders... only to break his neck when he trips in front of the endzone since once again, you live and die by the dice.","November 14, 2015","true","38.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would need to double check, but at 185 hours, I am pretty sure this is the game that I have logged the most actual gametime hours on.\n\nI am a fan of GW's products in general, but I had never played nor really been interested in Blood Bowl. I picked this game up during a Steam sale and fell in love.\n\nSome of the other comments are true about the very steep learning curve. That may put some people off. What are all of these different skills? What does Armor Rating do? Why can't I ever score a touchdown? While it is fun, it can be a bit frustrating to play right out of the box. I had probably logged a good twenty hours before I started to figure things out.\n\nOnce you get it figured out, though, the sky is the limit. This is a brilliantly tactical game, elegant yet complex in design. I would actually go as far as to call it possibly the tightest rule set GW has ever produced. If you know anything about GW, then you know that they aren't exactly famous for good rule sets. But Blood Bowl's system can stand tall with the best of them. It really is that good.\n\nHaving said that, as usual with GW games, luck can play more of a factor than people would like. But there are so many ways to mitigate the potentially disastrous effect of poor dice in this game through sound tactics that it's not much a problem once you get the game figured out. The only time it can really sting is when your star player with a billion experience points winds up dead. But that's part of the game, and you knew that going in! Real soldiers get their noses bloodied and keep fighting anyway.\n\nIf you're able to get in with a good league, that's probably the best way to play this game. The online multiplayer community seems fairly active, but the multiplayer client is pretty wonky and getting games in can be a of a pain. That is definitely one of the flaws of this product.\n\nIn any case, if you're a fan of Blood Bowl or a fan of this kind of game in general, this game belongs in your collection. Don't hesitate to pick it up. Or, you can pick up the Chaos Edition, which has three additional playable teams (none of which I was interested in, so I got this one for slightly cheaper)","June 24, 2015","true","198.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Humour is good, gameplay isn't bad either, yet sometimes the game gets just too infuriating for some reason. So I'm going to list the pros and cons of this game, and you can make your mind yourself.\n\nPros:\nGood dose of dark humour from the two commentators.\nGreat variety of teams/races to play with.\nDifferent play modes, and you can even edit the rules.\nBlood, violence, and random, untinkable, kills (an elf single-handedly killing a minotaur? Who knew?)\nLots of skills, equipment, etc.\n\nCons:\nSteep learning curve. Curve is so steep, it could be called a wall. Yes, the tutorial explains most of the gameplay, but there is too much "For this, reffer to the manual". Said manual is about 80 pages...\nEvasion system is maybe too easy. With 4 Agility (base Agi for Agi-based players), there is just about nothing that can stop you\nBattle system can also be somewhat flawed, as if you are against a strenght-based team, they will only put all their players around the one carying the ball, and due to the odds, you are very unlikely to stop even one of them.\n\nLong story short, if you play this game, expect to lose, expect to get frustrated, expect that what you though to be a good strategy was a bad one. If you are unsure, buy this game while on sale, as it often seems to be.","December 1, 2015","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said, it's very enjoyable, and multiplayer is more fun than playing against the simple-minded AI. There's plenty of teams, at least one is likely to fit your playstyle, and it's a strategy/RPG/sports game mix that is at least worth trying out. Why the warning at the beginning? There are just some matches you'll play where you'll have your star player with the best stats and most points get killed permanently by some rookie player who is nowhere near as good. There's matches where you will never roll the option to knock the opposing player's units over and instead just push them around or knock out your own unit and their unit.

The number of teams is really nice because each team represents different playstyle : the humans are pretty much balanced and you'll be able to throw passes or run through the opponent's line whereas elves' playstyle is based mainly on passes and dodging tackles due to their agility, Khemris will try to litteraly crush the opponent's line to get their holder of the ball to the touchdown because they can't do a single pass while gobelins will play dirty by using unconventionnal weapons during the match such as chainsaws, pogo sticks etc...\nAt the beginning you'll be a little lost if you didn't play the board game because nearly nothing is explained, you'll have to read the rules book and that will take you about 1h to get through this but when you master the rules it gets really fun. You should start by playing the campaign mode because that's how you'll learn most easily.\nFinal flaw : sometimes you just wish to play real american football ^^ (and maybe you'll find the commentaries getting a little bit old after a bunch of hours of game)","February 1, 2014","true","42.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The number of teams is really nice because each team represents different playstyle : the humans are pretty much balanced and you'll be able to throw passes or run through the opponent's line whereas elves' playstyle is based mainly on passes and dodging tackles due to their agility, Khemris will try to litteraly crush the opponent's line to get their holder of the ball to the touchdown because they can't do a single pass while gobelins will play dirty by using unconventionnal weapons during the match such as chainsaws, pogo sticks etc...\nAt the beginning you'll be a little lost if you didn't play the board game because nearly nothing is explained, you'll have to read the rules book and that will take you about 1h to get through this but when you master the rules it gets really fun. You should start by playing the campaign mode because that's how you'll learn most easily.\nFinal flaw : sometimes you just wish to play real american football ^^ (and maybe you'll find the commentaries getting a little bit old after a bunch of hours of game)","February 1, 2014","true","42.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite all the bugs and small interface quirks, they don't really make games like these often anymore. Don't go thinking it's a sports game, it's a 1-on-1 turn-based arena / stadium violence brawler that happens to have a pigskin caught in the middle. The hook bit is that it's got light RPG features that give your team and your players a magnificent sense of progression, at least until your precious players die - permadeath is how it's done. The chess-like thinking man's pace might turn off meth-abusing carpal tunnel clickfreaks. Private leagues can net your team a legendary status among your friends and it multiplies the game's fun factor by 10.","November 28, 2010","true","157.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I was frustrated then by the absurd strings of dice rolls churned out by the game's Random Number Generator and was able to rather easily convince myself to put it down. After watching a few other people play it, however, I was just about ready to delve back into it, so I got it on sale on Steam and commenced with the delving over a weekend.\n\nIn the immortal words of Ron Burgundy, "I immediately regret this decision."\n\nAs someone who mostly plays single player games, the best element of Blood Bowl - its multiplayer experience, which is incidentally probably the best way to learn the game - is lost on me, and even when the tutorial does its best to explain things, there are still elements of the game that require studying the massive rule book to grasp, reminding me why I never got into Games Workshop titles in the first place. The game lacks accessibility for new players in its admittedly varied single player modes, often putting them in situations where they must lose *a lot* to master the game while the AI waffles between bafflingly stupid and gleefully exploiting the RNG. It's true that a number of studies have been undertaken to see if the dice lean a certain way and have come back negative for bias, but that doesn't ease the frustration of playing the game and experiencing the bizarre runs of ones and sixes and unsatisfactory results (nor does the small handful of very loud, very condescending voices in the established community who try to shout down frustrated players).\n\nIn short, there's too much luck involved for it to be an enjoyable strategy experience in a game with a steep learning curve that essentially requires having friends with the game to get the most enjoyment out of it. The only thing separating it from the actual tabletop version is the reasonable price, which works against it; if I wanted to learn how to play a tabletop game, I would take the extra time and effort to learn the board game rather than playing the video game version of it.\n\nUnless you're a tabletop Blood Bowl player looking for the digital experience or have someone else (preferably a small group of friends) who is also looking to buy the game, stay away from this one.","August 3, 2015","false","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Get the actual rulebook to this  game from your local comic shop or any game shop that specializes in Roleplaying games, or else you'll never understand the gameplay or the rule concept behind Bloodbowl.

Blood Bowl takes a turn based approach to American Football and with the help of a unique roster of 20+ races and factions, turns it into a violent and chance based struggle to the endzone. The less patient or and those easier to become enraged at RNG may not like it as you live and die by the dice and a single bad role can turn something as innocent to trying to pick up the ball into a bloodbath with multiple players dead and the enemy right at your endzone for the next turn. However, those that play and enjoy the game will learn and be able to do amazing things like kill the ball carrier, then retrieve the ball with another player, pass it to the team's star gutter runner (if you built a skaven team) and have him run all the way down the field dodging numerous defenders... only to break his neck when he trips in front of the endzone since once again, you live and die by the dice.","November 14, 2015","true","38.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The storymode sets simple goals for each match... sometimes you only play half a match... and you master the basics (or in my case re-remember how to play because its been several years since I used to play on my xbox 360).

A cursory understanding of dice probability will be of some help for those (like me) who might quit in a rage with the words "cheating computer!"\nLong term players unanimously denounce the single player AI as useless although coming almost from fresh I'll say it's enough to give you the basic concepts and will punish mistakes.

Build a fantasy team from the world of warhammer and have them play "football" or just have them kill one another. There is some skill involved, but this is most definitely a game for the pessimists.

At least then you will be givien the option to have them either be dead or be dead.

It's a turn-based game which has a turn timer that can't be turned off. It is hard to come up with a sensible strategy in the limited time available.\n\n2. If you leave a match for any reason, even if you save it first, you will get hit with a loss in campaign mode.\n\n- Keep in mind that the above is in solo play. So there is no legit reason for the above.\n\n3. The AI teams you play against in campaign mode are all a lot better than yours. Going by the ratings that are given, the opposing teams are 50% better, and as I understand it, remain this much better than you even as you improve - and that's a best case scenario. So even if you set up your players in a semi-intelligent fashion, the AI can just dodge past you or run you over, since their guys have a lot more individual talent than yours.\n\nI gave Blood Bowl Legendary plenty of time because I usually like games like this, and I really liked the Blood Bowl game that was released in the 90's. But eventually I had to throw in the towel and concede that this game is absolutely terrible. It's the worst game in my library.\n\nIf you're interested in playing a turn-based American Football style game, check out Frozen Cortex which is a lot better than this.","January 30","false","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And it technically still is. Blood Bowl is a great game. The underlying mechanics are great, and Chaos Edition was, even with the release of BB2, the definitive edition of the game.\n\nKeyword was. With the release of BB2 we saw a slow downward spiral of the MP community, to the point where today, the only action going on in BB1, either CE or Legendary, is in scheduled organized leagues. As such I cannot reccomend BB1 to a new player. BB2 may be a steep ask what with the lesser amount of teams, but it's where most of the pickup MP community has gone. There also is the freeware alternative called FUMBBL, that's 2d and java based. Both are a far better option than BB1 now for actual MP.\n\nOrdinarily I would not go an remove and change the thumb to a down for a game simply because of the MP community drying up, but for Blood Bowl the entirety of the game is both MP, and has moved on to a nearly identical platform as well at that, and thus I feel obliged to steer people to those two alternatives, either the updated retail version, or the smaller, more hardcore community of the freeware game.","June 3","false","280.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
