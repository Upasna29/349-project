"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Katzilla/recommended/237930/","Katzilla","Katzilla","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Katzilla/","142 products in account","Transistor is the second game from Supergiant Games, the developers of the critically acclaimed Bastion. Those who have doubts about whether this game lives up to Bastion's expectation can be at ease: Transistor delivers and more.\n\nStory:\nYou play as Red, a famous singer in the city of Cloudbank. One night after a performance, a group of people, the Camerata, attempted to kill Red with a strange, green sword, but she was saved by someone.\n\nWaking up, she found herself next to the corpse of a man, stabbed by that same sword: the Transistor. The sword starts speaking, and not only that, but seems to know her. Urging her to pull it out of the corpse, the two start tracking the Camerata down, seeking answers, while fighting what seems to be robotic creatures sent to hunt them down.\n\nBut things may not be as they seem.\n\nThe story of Transistor seem simple and straight-forward on the surface, but most of it isn't handed down to the player, instead inferred and concluded from various hints noticed in the environment, character interaction and character profiles. It encourages the player to seek answers along the main character, and leaves a lot up for interpretation. That's something I like in a game.\n\nOne downside to the story however, is how short it is. It's far too short, the game is far too short. You'll be left wanting more, even with "recursion", playing a second play through with your stats intact.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is a mix of Action RPG and traditional turn-based RPG, using the Turn() system that I will touch upon soon. Red is able to equip up to 4 slots of "Functions", essentially abilities, upgrade those functions with up to two functions a slot, and assign functions as passive abilities, for up to 4 passives.\n\nIn battle, Red wields the Transistor. In Diablo style, she can use the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 on the keyboard to select an ability, then the right-mouse button to use that ability. Abilities can be offensive, such as shooting a long-range beam or a destructive shockwave, or supportive, such as turning invisible for a period of time or turning enemies friendly.\n\nThe Turn() system adds a new depth to the action RPG. It allows Red to stop time momentarily in order to plan and input a certain number of commands: attacking, setting up traps, maneuvering around the map to escape enemy clusters or get behind obstacles, you can do all that. But once all commands are preformed and the Turn() bar is depleted, Red is left (almost) unable to attack until it recharges again; use Turn() at your own discretion, balancing attack and defense.\n\nThe game offers the choice of "limiters", handicaps that increase the difficulty of the game in return for better EXP awards. There are achievements you can only get by using limiters, the hardest achieved with all 10 limiters. In addition, there is a "sandbox" unlocked in-game that allows you to tackle specific-themed challenges, like a speed challenge, or a Turn-planning challenge.\n\nGraphics:\nTransistor uses an isometric point of view, being able to go in all 2D directions. The sprites are smooth and look good, but the highpoint of the graphics is the artwork. The character portraits, whether in-game or in profiles, are drawn beautifully. The artist, Jen Zee, did a brilliant, detailed job, and it shows even on the OST cover.\n\nSound:\nHere is where Transistor really shines. The game's OST is amazing. From Ashley Lynn Barrett's beautiful voice in The Spine, In Circles, and other songs, to Darren Korb setting up poignant, melancholic instrumentals that fit the mood perfectly. Tracks play hand-in-hand with gameplay, showing up at specific times for maximum impact, further heightening the experience.\n\nI highly recommend getting the OST along with the game, if you can. Well worth the extra bucks.\n\nSummary:\nTransistor is a beautiful, enjoyable game. It has a bittersweet, albeit short, story that forces the player to think. Brilliant soundtrack, and beautiful artwork. The gameplay won't last you long, but there is decent replayability in it. Try picking it up immediately whenever it's on sale.","October 4, 2014","true","14.2"," 621 of 655 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","621","655","5","11"

Beautiful graphics and the alluring, lullaby soundscape create a marvelously intriguing atmosphere that is sure to appeal to nearly any gamer.  The narrative is interesting, but doesn’t explain everything and leaves a lot of room for interpretation.  Together, these aspects create a very entertaining, albeit somewhat short, experience.\n\nProbably the first thing you will notice is how aesthetically pleasing this game is.  If you are someone who enjoys games with graphics that feel like interactive paintings, you will definitely enjoy the art-style in Transistor.  Complementing the beautiful art is the serenading, sing-song soundscape.  These elements are perfectly crafted and blended to create a truly inspired atmosphere.\n\nThe game drops you right into the thick of the narrative, and things are slowly explained as you progress through the story.  However, the explanations of things are far from “spoon-fed,” and much of the story is open to interpretation.  The tale unfolds during gameplay for the most part, so things stay lively rather than there being many plot-development inspired lulls in the action.  Be aware that because of this style of narrative gameplay, the game is very linear and it will continue to usher you from one spot to the next with little room for exploration.\n\nThe combat and actual gameplay mechanics are an interesting blend of RPG elements, isometric hack-and-slash, and turn-based tactical planning.  You will gain experience as you play and can unlock new abilities which can then be combined in various ways to keep things fresh as you progress through the game.  A dynamic difficulty system, Limiters, is another appealing aspect of the game.  Using these, you can increase the difficulty of the game in various ways (more enemies, stronger enemies, less access to abilities, etc.) which allows you to customize the gameplay to your skill level.\n\nOne downside is that the game is rather short.  However, you also can’t even unlock everything in a single playthrough no matter how thorough you are— so the game is clearly designed to be played through at least twice.  That said, I personally would have much preferred if the game was twice as long with the ability to unlock everything in one playthrough.\n\nIn short, Transistor is a very well designed game that certainly has a very unique identity.  This underlying novelty combined with the charming atmosphere provides a truly enthralling gameplay experience.  I would say any all-around gamer will enjoy this game, and obviously fans of the genre(s) even more so.  Expect 8 to 15 hours depending on if you want to do everything and play through a second time.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","August 10, 2015","true","15.4"," 302 of 324 people (93%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","93","302","324","14","3"

Yeah that one. Let's begin:\n\nAesthetics: 10/10Well as you can CLEARLY see from the screenshots and the given link above, Transistor is absolutely breathtaking. The game takes the cake for visual and musical extravagance, as both mix so perfectly well with one another, that it become evidently difficult to express in objective terms the splendor that it creates in the brain, how so very atmospheric this game is, it's more of an emotional virtue than one being explainable through words alone. People have been coining the term 'art', which by no means is an understatement, the aesthetics of the game, voice acting (haha three actors, funny), music and graphics are as I rarely say, perfect.\n\nStory/Characters: 9.50/10Rarely does the medium of gaming (especially in this day & age) employ such precocious writing and superb storytelling, Transistor applies to this small margin of games. A game that truly respects the intellect and free thinking of it's players, requires an intelligent producer, no? Supergiant deserves an excellent applause for their creative usage of the mechanic of replayability. To truly cherise the game's universe, one must complete the game several times to unlock all of the information that is present. A truly cherishable quality Transistor has, is it's two characters which create a sense of dread and unknowingness with each other. Their relations throughout the game serve to state implicit subjectations on the world around them, Red through her interactions on the OVC and the Transistor's commentary. A huge contrast to each other which creates a sense of accepting lack, one without a body and one without a voice.\n\nMechanics/Gameplay: 8.75/10As an RPG game, Transistor holds a creative candle in the rat saturated tunnel that is the RPG industry. Of recent years, the well known RPG's of it's time have begun to show how dated their mechanics hold up in our era (yes you, Final Fantasy). This is why the liberty to experiment and employ new ideas is so vital in our industry today. Transistor is unique in which that profiles become the tools of the trade. Transistor can be played as a turnbased game or as a free action one, which by the way, both work very well in concurse with another. You have 13 functions (abilities) to use in your kit, yeah I know that's a small amount, but guess what? for every function you have, you get the ability to fuse with another, and for every fusion you have with another function, you get to fuse with another! So this means there are roughly 22,283,705,698,113 combinations of Transistor functions. (Transistor Wiki, Cited) That's a lot of unique ways to fight your enemies.\n\nFinal Verdict: 9.50/10It's hard to see why in this day and age producers don't want to experiment with their products given that the industry would absolutely kill for it, but then again, since when do producers even listen to the demands of the consumers? Transistor is a beacon of hope in the dark hallway that is the gaming industry, and hopefully you can agree with me, that this game is something special.","October 24, 2014","true","11.8"," 326 of 364 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","326","364","4","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/10112/recommended/237930/","10112","Joe10112","http://steamcommunity.com/id/10112/","184 products in account","(WARNING: LONG COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW, READ EDIT 4 FOR OVERALL SUMMARY)\n\nThis game is created by the same makers as Bastion, which is one of my favorite games ever. Upon loading, Transistor is visually appealing, and Logan Cunningham (Rucks in Bastion) makes a reappearance which is exciting. Controls are fluid, music is amazing--I'm very excited to play through this game!\n\nEDIT 1: After playing for about an hour, I must say that I think all the expectations I have had for this game are met. Unlike Bastion, which was more of a go-get-em game, Transistor really makes you think and analyze your tactics in battle, especially with the new "time stop" system where you can plan out your actions (each move you make will cost part of your "energy bar"). There are plentiful save points, and a nice level-up system to improve your skillset. The game is mysterious so far, and I think it really fits into the mood. However, some people might dislike how the story isn't really clear, and you're just following the path without much reason until (supposedly) later on in the game when things will be made more clear.\n\nMy only qualms with the gameplay itself are the somewhat repetitive nature of the fights (although each fight calls for new tactics), and the somewhat tricky level-up system which seems a bit arbitrary. The upgrades arn't clearly defined as to what exactly they do. Overall, some parts of the game feel like I'm not sure what's going on or what I'm supposed to do to upgrade the Transistor with, but that just adds to the mysterious nature of the game at the beginning.\n\nEDIT 2: Having come across the first "boss" now, I really think that I can speak for all people when I say--wow. The way in which the "characters" speak is amazing. The fight had me on my toes, really making me consider the best way to defeat it without losing too much health. I was blown away at how the screen colors changed and blurred as I started to lose more and more health.\n\nEDIT 3: After tinkering for a while at an Access Point (checkpoints basically), I think I figured out exactly how the upgrades work. The Transistor has four slots which hold a primary ability. Each primary ability has two secondary "upgrade" slots. In addition, you have four passive slots. You will collect "cores" which you can slot and re-slot at any Access point. For instance, I could socket Crash() into Ability 1, with Break() as its "upgrade" to have a medium-damaging medium-range attack that mini-stuns (opposed to the regular melee-ranged attack without the Break() upgrade). Or, (normally), you could leave Crash() as Primary Ability 1 (melee-range attack) and Break() as Primary Ability 2 (Long-Ranged attack). Or, you could put one into your passive once you get more cores. There are also "Limiters" which increase the power of the enemies you face (similar to Idols in Bastion), but reward you with more EXP. Indeed, the customization is insane in this game--I can foresee myself spending quite a bit of time customizing once I obtain more cores. Play how you want to play--fighter, stealth, assassin, long-range--just customize your cores to fit your playstyle! Extremely well done, albeit a little confusing at first to figure out the customizations. Only qualm might be (if any)...there are TOO MANY choices!\n\nEDIT 4: Finished the game, Steam says it took me ~5 hours overall, but this doesn't include the second playthrough (Recursion Mode) which I think I will be playing soon. Overall, I think this game is a worthy successor to Bastion. However, I still prefer Bastion. Why? Bastion was a bit more clear-cut and easier to process. The Calamity happened, fix it. In this game, it took until halfway through the game for me to actually realize most of the protagonist/antagonist/story arc. There were also quite a few "did not expect that" moments, which can be both seen as positive and negative overall. I personally was confused at the ending--in a way, for me, not much closure, but I accepted it. I could see it going over poorly with lots of people however. This game feels a lot darker than Bastion for sure, and I really thought that the narration in some parts was quite hefty and really tugged at my conscience. It definitely leaves you with a lot to think about and has more going on beneath the surface--you will want to play this game with a very open and sharp mind. Great to discuss as well.\n\nAlso, remember to check out all the OVC Terminals--you definitely don't want to skip those as a fair portion of the story and development relies on you reading and filling in the blanks from the information given at them (Thanks to Dragonfire973 for reminding me!). Also, when you have time, make sure you socket all the functions into every slot (Primary/Secondary/Passive) and read up on all the information unlocked.\n\nPros:\nAmazing Artwork, Beautiful Soundtrack, Superb Narration. I expected nothing less.\nLots of customization for how you want to play the game.\nStory-arc similar to Bastion, so this story will feel somewhat similar.\n\nCons:\nSomewhat repetitive battles, but interesting nonetheless.\nOften confused as to what really was going on story-wise (not much explanation of what was going on), but this could be intended.\nNot much closure for the ending, but definitely lots to think about. Really made me think about the whole story after the credits had rolled.\n\nScore: 9/10\nA very nice game overall. The aesthetics of the game are unmatched. However, some people might feel like the game is a bit confusing to wrap your head around. I preferred Bastion's ending to Transistor's, because Bastion was more clear and provided some closure. Transistor left me wondering what really happened and left me with too many unanswered questions. However, it did leave me with a lot to think about, and I want to go through the game again to see if I pick up anything I missed the first time through.\n\nIf you have any doubts on buying this game, your doubts should be dispelled--this game is worthy of your $20; a beautiful second game released by Supergiant Games.","May 20, 2014","true","5.1"," 518 of 602 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","518","602","0","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/auspexao/recommended/237930/","auspexao","AuspexAO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/auspexao/","786 products in account","I feel like I need to set the record straight on Transistor. The biggest complaint I've heard about it is that the story is inscrutable and there isn't much of it. First of all, that is not true, but more importantly it just doesn't matter. Transistor is a masterpiece because you don't have to be a detective to enjoy the game. It is, at its very root, a simple love story. If you can appreciate that much and enjoy the beautiful art and incredible music, than you have a game well worth buying.\n\nBeyond that there is the mystery of Cloudbank to uncover, and the many philosophical questions to answer. We are taught to value the voices of each person and try to create a consensus that serves to make everyone happy. Transistor toys with the idea of a "vote" vs. a "choice." Transistor is not preaching any answers, and that's why I think the narrative may come off as weak. We have villains who could be heroes and a main character who reasonably and selfishly just wants to pursue her own life without getting embroiled in any political machinations.\n\nThis is a supremely beautiful work of art and in so many ways that I will easily recommend it to everyone. Explore the world of Cloudbank for awhile and decide how much you want to discover. I promise that even a short trip will be a memorable one.","December 29, 2014","true","12.6"," 267 of 292 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","267","292","7","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/237930/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Transistor is a sci-fi themed RPG action game, developed and published by SuperGiant games (the same guys who brought us Bastion), releasing on PC in mid 2014, and then later in that year on PS4, and then got a further port to IOS in June of 2015.\n\nGame play in Transistor takes a lot of elements from Bastion. The camera angle is in an isometric point of view as you control the main character, Red. You traverse a series of locations fighting enemies, known as the "Process". A nice feature which has been added which is where Transistor differs from Bastion, is that you can either fight in real time, or in a planning phase. The real time plays very similar to how any isometric action game would play out, however the planning phase really adds an element of strategy to this title; you have a limited number of commands you can carry out before needing to recharge, these commands include moving around the scene and casting your various spells and abilities.\n\nAs you progress through the story, you will come across other characters who have fallen victim to the Process, and you will take over their souls and learn new abilities and powers. You can either use these new abilities as straight up spells/attacks to use, or you can also enhance your current spells/attacks with the new abilities, granting unique effects, such as adding an area of effect technique on an ability. You can also have up to 2 of these abilities being used as a passive effect on Red, so are in effect all the time.\n\nTransistor is a stunningly gorgeous game. The art style on show here are some of the most perfect graphics I have seen. This game should be one of the front runners for people trying to get the media to understand that video games should be classed as a form of art.\n\nThe story in this game almost had me tearing up at the end, it is one of the most heart wrenching endings to a game I have ever played. Along the way you come across a series of plot twists, and at one point you even think the  story is ending only for it to take a dramatic turn and continue. Words cannot fathom how gut wrenching I felt at the end, I encourage anyone who has already got Transistor, to play it and finish it just to experience the final scenes.\n\nMuch like Bastion, the audio is one of, if not the best feature of this game. The narration whilst not as good as Bastion's (because that was pretty much perfect), it still sets the mood of the game, and carries the plot through to conclusion extremely well. There isn't much voice acting in the game, actually Red doesn't speak at all, until the end of the game. The sound track to Transistor has been released individually, has sold phenomenally well. Some of the songs actually remind me a lot of a sort of James Bond movie soundtrack.\n\nI have to admit, the lack of a tutorial in Transistor does knock it back a little bit, but once you actually are able to work out what all of the interface means, and how to properly carry out the fight scenes, the gameplay becomes second nature and you are able to blast through hoards of enemies without batting an eye lid. The end boss is something of a sufficient challenge as well, resulting in me having to replay it at least four times before I was able to succeed in beating it.  Another nice feature to be seen is, that you can actually implement your own difficulty barriers in game, such as allowing enemies to do more damage to you, BUT you get some sort of reward in return, such as more experience.  You are able to chop and change these "barriers" as and when you please in the same way you can with your spells abilities.\n\nTransistors levels are all extremely well fleshed out, allowing you every opportunity to venture off the main track and down alleyways and into buildings with no real specific plot line to it, letting you explore the gorgeous world this game is set in. You are also able to use terminal computers scattered around the world, allowing you to dig deeper into the lore, and some times interacting with them to complete surveys and sign petitions should you desire to.\n\nA full playthrough of Transistor will take you just under eight hours. This is one of the few games that I can say I have finished more than once, just because of how good it is. There isn't any side missions in the game, but they aren't needed, just because you will be so immersed in the main story that you wouldn't want to do them anyway. Even though the ending of the game is the same regardless of the route you take to get there, the gameplay is such a high quality, that the replay ability is still there, because you will just want to experience the sheer fun you have whilst playing.\n\nSadly I did have a couple of issues getting Transistor to run properly; firstly the game does not support anything higher than 1080 resolutions, whilst this isn't a massive issue given that 1080 is still the standard, it would of still been nice to see it in there. Secondly, I had to delve into the registry of my PC to fix and issue with the game also not loading into full screen mode correctly - if you run into this issue, the fix can be found in this thread on the Steam forums.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/237930/discussions/1/540743128801543513/\n\nTransistor is another absolutely stellar game by SuperGiant Games that everyone needs to play; some of the game's original ideas, the graphics and soundtrack are some of the best I have ever played in my fifteen years of gaming. Lord knows what else these guys have in the pipeline, it can only be amazing given their track record. For the low price of £14,99, you need to pick this game up. It has been known to go as low as £3 on Steam, which is I would almost class as day light robbery if you can get it for that price. Do not hesitate to pick this game up for the full price.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Seriously, if you decide to buy this (and you probably should), make sure to crank up your volume, put on your best headset and maybe slap some glue on its speakers so you can never take 'em off again. Trust me, you're not gonna want to.\n\nSo what do we have here? Let me just sum things up:\n\n- Logan Cunningham: check. The voice behind Rucks from Bastion is back, do I need to say more?\n- Story-telling through narration: check. This is done in almost the same manner as before, with one minor difference I won't mention for those who'd rather find out on their own.\n- Gorgeous, vibrant artwork by Jen Zee[jenzee.deviantart.com]: check, check and check. Jen is one of my favorite artists and she no doubt has outdone herself yet again.\n- Breathtaking musical score: no comment. If you're still not sold by words alone, check out the soundtrack on YouTube and draw your own conclusions.\n\nWhat's different from Bastion?\n\n- Combat mechanics: confusing at first as you'd probably be expecting action-packed hack n' slash, but in the end it boils down to being a curious hybrid of Frozen Synapse's tactical gameplay and some of Bastion's core mechanics, all mashed together into something I find difficult to describe. Personally, it also reminds me of The Bureau's "Battle Focus", just minus all the slo-mo. Powers and combos are there: as before in Bastion, you'll probably spend some time looking for a perfect skill combination to cater your own playstyle, which is a fun experience in its own right as there are quite a few options to pick from.\n\n-Game length: I finished it in under 7 hours with most of the challenges completed. While it IS a lot shorter than Bastion, you still get access to New Game+ upon completion so you can blast your way through it again. I still find game's length disappointing however, so if you're really concerned about that, I'd strongly advise you to wait for sale.\n\nIn general, Transistor is still as charming, well-paced and beautiful as its predecessor: you can absolutely tell they're both cut from the same cloth. But, while Bastion was somewhat more experimental in terms of narration, Transistor takes a bold step forward and puts even more information at your disposal than before. Which is probably a good thing. That is, if you like reading. Well, you've come this far, so I'll just assume you do.\n\nIssues I ran into so far:\n\n- My only and the main gripe with this game: abnormal, seemingly random freezing. I'm not talking "locking up at checkpoint saves" kind of freezes, either. I had to ctrl+alt+del at least 6 times due to it completely freezing up on me, "hl2.exe has stopped working"-style, with looping sound and everything. AFAIK this is a common problem at the moment of writing, so you've been warned.\n\nP.S. Hold TAB while you're in game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/recommended/237930/","noibn","noibn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/","1756 products in account","I am a huge fan of Supergiant Games' previous game, Bastion. Topping that game was a tall order, but I think they've managed to equal, if not better it, with Transistor... though I guess that depends on your personal tastes. First of all, if you have not yet played Bastion, I implore you to do so. If you have played it, and liked it, then I can definitely recommend checking out Transistor. Both games share some common fundamental elements: isometric action gameplay, a set of diverse weapons, amazing music and visuals, and stories moved forward by in-game voiceover. In the case of Bastion, the voiceover was provided by a narrator. In Transistor, the voice is that of the soul of a "dead" man within the main character's weapon (the Transistor). The other main difference is in the way combat is handled. While combat in Bastion plays out in real time, in Transistor you can pause the action at will (on a cooldown) and plan out a set of actions (or "functions" as they are called in game) that will play out in rapid sequence. So essentially, Transistor is more of a strategy game.\n\nThe game takes place in a city called Cloudbank. You play as Red, a singer that's lost her voice after an attack by an organization called the Camerata. Red wields the Transistor, an object that can absorb the essence of people, who in turn, become "functions" that can be assigned to your combat loadout. The gameplay loop consists of clearing out groups of enemies, collecting new functions for the transistor, and then combining those functions in all sorts of different ways. There are 16 functions, each of which can be used in one of 3 ways: as a primary action, as an upgrade effect for a primary action, or as a passive effect for your overall loadout. With 4 passive slots, 4 action slots, and 8 upgrade slots available to assign your functions, you can imagine how many different possible combinations there are to experiment with. And man, is it ever fun. There's plenty of room for experimentation to find what works best for your play-style. It's a brilliant combat system. The only negative I would say about it is that it's a bit confusing to figure out at first, as the game offers little in the way of explanation. It doesn't take all that long to get your head wrapped around how things work, but the early going might be a bit confusing.\n\nVisually, the game is just absolutely stunning. The environments are so gorgeous that I would eat them up if I could. The story is somewhat inscrutable (which I've heard brought up by people as a negative on the game), but there is plenty of information available within the game to flesh things out if you put in the attention and effort required. But ultimately, I never felt any of that really mattered too much. At its heart, the main plot is simply a love story, and that's all that really matters in the end. The other highlight of the game for me was the music. As with Bastion, music has a huge impact on the game experience. The music is consistently outstanding throughout, perfectly setting the mood for each area you traverse. There are also a few vocal tracks spread throughout, which are particularly good, especially the ending song, which was the high point of the game for me.\n\nI guess my only disappointment with the game is that there just isn't more of it. The story can be completed in around 6-8 hours I would estimate. After that, the game allows you to "recurse" through the story again indefinitely, while keeping all of the upgrades you've acquired, and making the enemy encounters harder each time. This is nice, and worth playing through at least once, but really, there's only so much you can go through the same few areas and watch the same cutscenes, etc, no matter how much you enjoy the gameplay and visuals. But what is there is excellent and worth the asking price. So in summary, if you liked Bastion and the turn-planning combat of Transistor sounds interesting to you, definitely give this a look. Or just give it a look anyways. Games like this just don't come around every day, and need to be experienced. I can't wait to see what Supergiant does next...","January 3, 2015","true","22.2"," 91 of 105 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","91","105","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/237930/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Uniting both action RPG mechanics and an engrossing world, Transistor isn’t just a spiritual successor to Bastion, it’s a full blown messianic triumph of beautiful art and sublime game design. Supergiant Games have exceeded their previous work with a game that marries fluent action RPG combat with sublime tactical planning & customisation. Yet that would be just half of Transistor's charm as the world, characters and narrative unfolds like an origami swan, leaving you to marvel at its gorgeous art design, intricate architecture and unique atmosphere.\n\nThe story begins with you, Red, claiming the Transistor from the body of a dead man. From there you begin to uncover the city of Cloudbank, why everyone has gone and what The Process is - sentient machine aggressors within this fallen Rapture. That reference is deliberate as there’s a little touch of Bioshock within Transistor - a fallen city, the mystery of its unravelling and tragedy yours to discover if you’re willing to put in the work to unlock its true secrets. This is made all the more acute by how Transistor welcomes you into its world with no fanfare, no menu screen. Just a fade from black opening up on your journey with the Transistor, voiced by the rich tones of Logan Cunningham, against The Process and their mysterious overlords - The Camarata.\n\nTo say any more would spoil the joy of discovering the details for yourself. Supergiant Games had deliberately kept details of Transistor to a minimum until release and it’s thanks to this blackout that’s made discovering the games systems, people and places a genuine joy.\n\nIt’s difficult to review Transistor without referencing Supergiant Games previous work - Bastion. That’s because its influences are plain to see with the same isometric-style viewpoint, similar art-style and even the same narrator. While those similarities may appear as merely iterative steps on paper for Transistor, they are in practice the opposite. The art style has evolved to be not just gorgeous, moody and atmospheric, it now conveys the spirit of Cloudbank without ever explicitly showing it in such a way that you feel part of that city, not just an observer with a controller.\n\nCombat is real time action-RPG based with four main skills available at one time. You can freeze the action once your Turn() bar has filled at any time and then plan out your attacks methodically. Once done you can unfreeze the game and Red will perform her balletic combat attacks with the Transistor. This appears at first to just be a cool looking feature to break up combat scenarios but very soon it becomes essential to besting The Process.\n\nIn this frozen state you can see the damage you are likely to cause, the effect different attacks can have in combination with each other and use it to quickly get behind enemies to deliver backstab moves. There’s nothing quite like positioning yourself correctly, freezing time and then delivering a quick series of moves to destroy everything. I’m not especially clever but by Jove, Transistor made me feel like a combat genius.\n\nAs the story progresses you’ll acquire more skills and this is where the combat evolves from those mechanics set down originally by Bastion. Instead of just swapping out skills when you want a change, every skill can be slotted into a secondary or tertiary upgrade slot to augment an already installed ability.\n\nFor instance, the basic attack move you start with is Crash(). You can then modify it with a skill like Bounce() which will chain attacks to multiple targets. Or with Cull() that sends enemies into the air. Or you could use either of those modifiers as one of the four main abilities. Cull(), a basic uppercut move and Bounce(), a skill that sends out pulses of energy.\n\nThis enables you to define the combat system in any way you want it. Like aggressive frontal-assault tactics or stealthy concealment? Perhaps turning a few enemies on to your side floats your boat? Or maybe just a blend of different styles? Transistor allows you to do what you like with this combat system rather than force you down a particular road.\n\nThe only restriction is if your health is reduced to zero in combat. Instead of death, one of your abilities is overloaded and will require at least two trips to an access point in order to recover. Then there are the Limiters - status effects that reduce your capability in combat but with the rewards of increased experience. As you can tell, what appears as a simple combat system in the beginning soon evolves into a complex and involving way to deal with The Process.\n\nThe way that combat is combined with the narrative is just as intriguing. As you use these new abilities in different ways or combinations it unlocks more about the person you acquired them from in the first place. Slowly the pieces of this mysterious world start to come together as you become more adept at combat. It encourages creativity and a deeper understanding of the mechanics you're working with on order to unlock the secrets of Cloudbank.\n\nBut It’s not all dark alleyways and moody lighting as you’ll have access to a ‘backdoor’ - a safe haven separated from the unrelenting assimilation of the Process. This serves as a menu to access the different challenge rooms Transistor offers. Here you can test and refine your combat skills and increase your level. Or you can just kick back and listen to the ridiculously awesome soundtrack while lounging in a hammock.\n\nThis densely packed experience is made up of small touches like that. From the way Red drags around the weighty Transistor, to how she combs her hair with her fingertips when admiring a view, with the best of all being her ability, at the touch of a button, to hum along to the excellent soundtrack.\n\nBefore playing I didn’t expect to be fully enraptured by Transistor, thinking the spectre of Bastion would haunt the experience too much. But neither did I expect Transistor to take that formula and evolve it into something so sublime and handcrafted that tears would roll down my cheek as the credits rolled. From its combat mechanics and customisation, to the narrative and the visually appealing art-style, this is an experience to be savoured, to lock yourself away in the confines of your gaming boudoir and revel in its luxurious design and perfection.\n\nA Must Play\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 8, 2014","true","43.1"," 84 of 104 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","84","104","0","4"

I beat it in about 11 hours, although I'm only about halfway through with Achieves.  I think this is a bit of a silly metric, though.  The more key question to me is "was it a good experience?"  I would say "absolutely".\n\nTransistor is a deeply beautiful and atmospheric game, with a bittersweet story told through powerful narration and themes.  It also effectively uses game mechanics to pull you 'into' the story and world.  It has a 'hum' button.  There are several scenes where the controls and gameplay shift to make the player 'feel' the scenes.  It is one of the best examples I've played of a game avoiding ludnarrative dissonance and in fact using gameplay as a narrative aid.\n\nTransistor left me with that same feeling of satisfaction I get after finishing a good book.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/puzzlefox/recommended/237930/","puzzlefox","puzzlefox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/puzzlefox/","201 products in account","I know, negative reviews on overwhelmingly recommended games won't win me any popularity points, but hear me out.\n\nIt breaks my heart to not recommend this. I had really high hopes due to how amazing Bastion was, and I went into this knowing that it is nothing like Bastion, so my dissapointment doesn't stem from that. Let me start off by saying that the combat customization is pretty neat, the art is nice, and the music is really nice.\n\n- The story just isn't that good. Futuristic world is being destroyed by virus-type-invaders and your sword/companion is the key to beating it. The ending is very predictable and there isn't much character development at all. There is such little story that I can't even expand on that without spoilers because of how little story there actually is.\n\n- The atmosphere is pretty but has very little variation. I got really tired of seeing the same grey blocks over and over.\n\n- The enemies have very little variation. You have turrets that buff/heal, fast dogs, floating objects that shoot beams at you, a mortar, am aoe tank, and guys that spawn suicide bombers. Not much else, the listed enemies all look exactly the same throughout the game; the only difference being small buffs as you progress. There are three bosses, each more forgettable than the last.\n\n- The combat is very tedious, and because (as above mentioned) the enemies lack variation, every fight feels the same. There are some great ways to customize your skills and buffs, but everything just feels the same. Since your last shred of action bar can perform skills that would normally take a huge chunk of action bar, every turn you take is just skill stacking just the right way so you can get the big one in at the end for free. It just feels exploity.\n\n- The backdoor area (a special zone where you can access challenges): probably my least favorite thing about this game. The trials are all (save for one) time consuming, tedious and pretty pointless. I did all the trials with very little to show for it other than maybe a level and a half and music tracks unlocked, which as far as I can tell, can only be listened to in the backdoor area.. A place that quickly becomes chore zone. Every time I finished trials, I was more than ready to leave.\n\n- No replayability. There just isn't. Restarting with all your skills would be nice if the skills weren't so bland. It's just doing the exact same thing over and over again a second time.\n\n-The game is incredibly short. I have 7.7 hours logged and I even took my time. I explored thoroughly and didn't move between areas until I knew that I had explored the whole area. I read all the dialogue and accessed/read/listened to/replied to all the terminals and still only got 7.7 hours out of it with no interest in or reason to begin ng+.\n\n- One of the things that irritated me the most is this game has an amazing soundtrack.... but it is hardly utilized in the game. When your in combat, you spend most of your time in a pause-type attack planning phase.. during that phase, the music is replaced by the same humming.. so you spend a lot of time listening to that one track that is her humming the same tune over and over. When you're running around/exploring, the sword is talking the whole time (not a bad thing) and you cannot hear the music at all.\n\nThe game was probably overhyped to me, which is probably why I feel as dissapointed as I do. If you love SuperGiant and love hearing Logan's voice (like me) I'd recommend getting it on sale. Otherwise, you might be dissapointed.","January 4, 2015","false","7.7"," 737 of 1,130 people (65%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","65","737","1","45","25"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/237930/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","For all their hundred-million dollar budgets and hundreds strong development teams, it feels as if indie games have all but entirely eclipsed those of AAA developers. Transistor stands at the precipice of this phenomenon, an unprecedented achievement in artistic vision and game design that I hesitate to review for fear of not doing it justice. Supergiant Games, creators of the outstanding Bastion, have not been resting on their laurels, returning after three years with an experience that has completely toppled any expectations I previously had for it, leaving me stunned and in awe at the scope of their vision and the skill in which they execute it. Transistor is, simply put, a masterpiece.\n\nTransistor isn’t the story of a falling city; of the rebel group, Camerata, letting loose a viscous process to annihilate the city of Cloudbank to be rebuilt to their designs. It’s not the story of the many characters filling its voluminous backstory, fleshing out a fascinating futuristic dreamscape that is so similar yet different to our own world. No, it is the story of two people, or more accurately the relationship between a girl and her sword. The dynamic between Red, a singer who has had her voice stolen, and the Transistor, a talking sword now housing the soul of a deadman, is what drives the narrative. Despite Red’s inability to talk, the Transistor’s dialog creates a tangible connection between the two; an emotional tie that makes the continued suffering of Red, and the guilt expressed by the Transistor (who somehow feels responsible for what happened to Red), incredibly real and heartbreaking.\n\nIt would be too easy to write Transistor off as using its many narrative tricks to hide the fact that its plot is fairly straightforward, because it’s not about what happens throughout the story, but the relationship between its two leads that makes it so compelling. All too often games will try to force characters to depend on each other, whether through arbitrary mechanics or cliched victim roles, but Transistor sidesteps this issue by having the two characters literally rely on each other to survive. They need each other, and its for this that the narrative manages to create such an effective emotional connection with these characters; similarly causing you to despise those that have put them through so much distress. As simple as it may sound, the nuance of every line and its delivery is no small feat, and a true testament to the writers and voice actors behind them.\n\nI could go on at end for how emotionally invested I became in the characters of Transistor, but it’s the finesse of its gameplay that truly astounded me. Aside from some mild exploration, the experience is entirely focused around its incredibly deep and rewarding combat system, which seems outwardly inaccessible but is shockingly intuitive once you get your hands on it.\n\nCombat can be broken down most easily into two phases: real time and the planning stage. During the former, you can use any of your abilities at will, but enemies in turn can also move and attack, which becomes an issue with the long build up required for most attacks. This is when you transition to the second phase, which then turns the game into a sort of strategy RPG, freezing time and allowing you to plan out your moves (which will then be executed near instantly when you leave the phase) with the only restraint being the action bar which is used up with each move you make. It's not an entirely unique formula, but Supergiant Games has carved out an incredibly fine tuned and complex niche for itself, with the sheer number of different ways you can approach an encounter.\n\nEvery action you make is the result of a function you have slotted in, which in turn can then have additional functions slotted on top of themselves, as well as passive functions which give you boosts outside of individual moves. However, none of these are separated into classes or otherwise excluded from being assigned a specific role with the rest of your abilities. This creates an incredible amount of options for you to experiment with, with each function you unlock having three unique abilities onto itself (if not more when combined with other functions), and new functions being added regularly as you progress and level up.\n\nSupergiant has also found a brilliant incentive to getting players to try out new combinations they might otherwise never use, by tying every bit of backstory to a specific function, which then needs to be used in all three slots (technique, enhancement, and passive) in order to unlock all of a character's biography. It’s a fantastic way to almost entirely fix a common problem of getting stuck in a routine of the using the same abilities the entire game, and had me constantly swapping different functions in which kept the combat fresh the entire game (even after having beaten it I haven’t used every combination there is, creating a ton of replay value on top of the already included new game plus mode).\n\nBastion was an undeniable artistic treat, but in comparison to Transistor it might as well be a rough prototype of a game. The art design of every single frame is unbelievably gorgeous, from amazing architecture and environmental designs, to characters and even the subtle yet beautiful sparks that spring forth from Red dragging the Transistor around. The dark color palette matches the somber mood of the narrative, but it does so without bringing you down with it, leaving enough brightness and pure beauty despite the events happening around you to make you feel like you’re on a vacation to a fantastical city in the sky. Darren Korb once again returns to deliver a soundtrack that surpasses what I even thought he was capable, with a layered and elaborate score that still feels as raw and personal as he's known for.\n\nTransistor left me floored. What Supergiant Games has accomplished is hard to properly put into words, as even with all I’ve said I can’t help but think I’ve barely scratched the surface of the praise I wish to heap upon the game.

An incident occurs that leads you down a path of no return. In the process, you receive the mysterious weapon known as the Transistor and the powers that come along with it.\n\nGameplay consists of real time combat mixed with an optional turn-based system. At anytime during normal combat, you can pause the game to plan and queue up attacks. This proves immensely helpful when you face large numbers of enemies at once.\n\nAs you progress through the game, the Transistor gains new powers. These can be used in either active (attack), support (supplement attack), or passive modes. The level to which you can customise powers to complement your playstyle is one of the highlights of the game.\n\nThe visuals of the game are another strong point. The artstyle is stunning. Great use of colours and imaginative design bring out the vibrancy and beauty of Cloudbank. This is a city you'd want to save.\n\nVoice acting and music is stellar. The soundtrack is atmospheric and easy on the ears, while the voice acting is filled with character.\n\nThe plot can be ambiguous but if you pay attention it makes sense by the end of the game.\n\nThe only downside is that a single playthrough lasts 6 hours or so. Some may find the $20 sgd pricepoint too high for that length, although there is a new game plus option that provides some replayability.\n\ntldr: A polished, unique Indie action rpg albeit a little short.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/recommended/237930/","JiveSoulBro","Jive Soul Bro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/","85 products in account","So you've read the reviews praising Transistor for its amazing scenery, the detailed hand-drawn sprites, the phenomenal soundtrack and maybe even read a thing or two about the gameplay which included words such as "time stop turn-based abilities" or "active and passive weapon functions" and you're left wondering... Is it accessible? Beauty being in the eye of the beholder and all, can the layperson appreciate the final product?\n\nAnswer: maybe not, but don't let that stop you from trying. New experiences build character and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is Transistor a new experience. It's just that Transistor is a game where the protagonist gains experience faster than the player behind the screen. Consider the following: you earn "functions" which can be used either in your weapon slot or as a passive buff to a function already in use, adding its properties to the active weapon. That's the active and the passive system! THAT'S HUGE! Do you realize how with four weapon slots (your four face buttons) and five functions, you already have twenty different configurations? Well hold on to your hats because there's a whole lot more than just five functions to play with. Try sixteen. Add to this secondary passive slots for player buffs, extra upgrade slots for weapons and a memory cost per function to manage and that's a lot to take in!\n\nThere's more. The whole time-skip ability pauses the game and allows you to plan out multiple actions in advance, at the cost of a cooloff period wherein no function can be activated. It's something that can certainly bite you in the ♥♥♥ if abused, so you want to hold on to it like a panic button. Or spam it constantly what with the correct build and enemies. Really, you don't know and the game doesn't provide you with much opportunities for experimentation. Enemy encounters are fixed and unique in nature; and although the game provides you with a Practice Mode, it's more target practice than battle practice.\n\nTransistor's greatest flaw resides in its extraordinarily linear story mode. There are no collectables or side quests, so if the story mode has a reputation for being short, that's only because there aren't any branching paths anywhere. There's nothing to look out for, all unlockables are gained by leveling up and earning XP is done exclusively by defeating enemies. Whom do not respawn and appear at fixed intervals. So your whole adventure feels like riding a conveyor belt: move to enemy encounter, defeat enemies, save at conveniently nearby terminal, repeat with the occasional story break.\n\nAlthough we commonly hate repetition, human beings learn by doing the same thing over and over again. Adding THE OPTION to redo a segment would be welcome and giving players a minor incentive to do so would go a long way in getting them acclimated to the active/passive system. There's no lack of technical info as the configuration screen offers you all of the hard numbers for your functions, but you want practice in addition to theory. Bastion provided "dreams" which were just waves after waves of monsters to defeat for extra shards. Practice Mode offers no such incentives and the targets don't fight back. For all of their efforts at writing a story, it seems as if the developers have forgotten to build a playground.\n\nThus I'll make my final verdict as simple as possible: buy Bastion first. That's a good game regardless of your sense of aesthetics (review available here). If you've enjoyed Bastion's stylistic direction, consider Transistor. Despite the change in setting, you'll recognize much of the artistic sensitivities that are the hallmark of Supergiant Games. Otherwise, you probably won't have the patience to appreciate Transistor. Regardless, you have to recognize the ambitiousness of what's ultimately a very simple concept at heart: make every weapon also act as a power-up. You can't fault that, and you want other game developers to crib the idea. So buy the game and encourage simple ideas that are complex in execution. We'll get more practice out from the other games.","November 29, 2014","true","15.3"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","31","35","0","2"

The game is developed by the people behind Bastion, but the 2 games have very few similarities, it's hard to compare them. Every aspect of Transistor is flawless, for now, no cons come to my mind. But I will try to review what I can.\n\nPros: Stunning sci-fi cyberpunk art style and setting\nAmazing voice acting\nWonderful, atmospheric soundtrack, one of the best I've heard in an indie game (purchasing the OST is very much worth it)\nInteresting and creative character designs (I can't go into detail here, might spoil it)\nAll the things I have mentioned above go together so well to create the rich, detailed world of Cloudbank\nInnovative combat: you can switch from hack-n'-slash mode to a strategic, turn-based one, and you should still plan your moves very well\nGame has a way of letting you figure out the story and lore on your own: if you skip any OVCs, you'll barely have an idea of what's going on, and you'll lessen the great experience\n(Trying to avoid spoilers as much as I can here) The story is memorable, and leaves you at some moments in suspense, and other moments just thinking about what just happened - it is unique and far from those 'good vs evil' cliché RPG plots\nLots of ways to customize your character build as well: you can combine up to 3 moves or 'Functions' and test how they work, you can add 'Limiters' that increase the challenge lvl but yield more rewards, etc\nGame is also strategic in a way that you should plan your battles well\nCons: Game is linear and does not have too much room for exploration\nThe story can be too short, and even vague for some people\nOverall Rating:9/10 - Transistor is more of an experience to me, than a game.","May 11","true","7.0"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","27","29","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Monukai/recommended/237930/","Monukai","monukai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Monukai/","1200 products in account","A heart-wrenching tragedy wrought with loss and sorrow, a bittersweet love story the likes of which are never seen in video games, an unbelievable experience that's as breathtaking as it is unforgettable——these are just a few of the things that Transistor has been for me. And don't think that I lavish the game with verbose and flattering descriptions idly either, this game swept me from my feet the moment I loaded it up and delved into the imaginative world it offered. Rarely have I been so immersed in a game and never before, not even in Supergiant Games' previous game Bastion, have I felt so emotionally involved in a game's story——it was refreshing to experience a game where I felt a surge of raw emotions... from frustration, to despair, to grief. And to add icing to the cake, this game's audio and visual presentation blows every other indie game out of the water... each time I step away from the game and come back to it, I'm still shocked to realize just how beautiful a game it truly is.\n\nRed, the character whose role you assume, finds herself in a strange and unsettling predicament after being attacked by a mysterious organization known as the Camerata. With the help of her companion, the Transistor (a.k.a. Breach()), she must seek answers from this mysterious group and fight the newly arrived threat of the Process. The Process comes in many forms, and Red with the Transistor in hand, must face off against them. The combat in this game is a hybrid between fast paced action and tactics. Red can be equipped with up to four active Functions and four passive Functions (essentially abilities). Each Function can also act as an upgrade for Function already equipped as an active ability. This allows for quite a lot of customization. Furthermore, there are Limiters, which act as a way of increasing the challenge within the game. Enable a handful of limiters and you'll easily find yourself tuning and customizing your Functions to overcome some of the harder encounters and challenges. There is definitely challenge to be had in this game if you seek it, and exploring all the customization options is one of the highlights of the game's combat system——some of the Function combos are ingenious and finding such a badass combo is always a joy.\n\nAnd while the game's combat system is superb, I'd probably rate it as the weakest feature simply because every other aspect of the game is so near perfection. The audio and visuals of the game are no exception. Anyone who has played Bastion should know from experience alone to expect something amazing when it comes to how a Supergiant Games' game should look and sound, and despite such high expectations they wouldn't be disappointed with Transistor. The game is just mesmerizingly stunning, to the point that it's hard to describe in words just how remarkable it is. It has to be played to be appreciated at the level it deserves. From gorgeous hand drawn scenery, to the hauntingly beautiful lighting, to art filled cutscenes... this game is beautiful. Audio is no exception either with solid voice acting (the voice of Rucks from Bastion voices the Transistor), perhaps the best original soundtrack in the entire industry which I could write an entire second review on alone, and don't forget Red's incredible humming prowess.\n\nAlthough the game presents perhaps the most extraordinary sensory experience in the indie scene, to me the true selling point of this game is the story and the way it is presented. There is a lot going on in this game and it's worth getting involved in. Read what's happening at the terminals, read the bios, listen to the audio logs——it pays off. But most importantly, listen to what Transistor says. Stop and listen. Pay attention. And when Red responds to Transistor via typing, just don't quickly read what she says but feel what she says. Following the connection between the two is what sucked me into the story and got me involved with it in a much more personal way. There is a lot of character depth for both Red and Transistor, and an equal depth in regards to the relationship between the two. Putting myself in the shoes (or heels, I suppose) of Red was a surreal experience, and feeling the pain, frustration, longing, and love through her perspective is what made this game something special.\n\nThe developers put love and care into making this game. The story is strong, no doubt. But I think what makes it stand out is that the developers built this game bottoms up starting with the story. Scene by scene crafting the perfect medium to tell this story, at every point making critical decisions about what music to be playing, what visuals to show, what Transistor's monologue should be; at every cutscene and at every interlude, deciding how best to portray the story through artwork and song. And by my reckoning it worked, they took a story and found the best way——the perfect medium——to tell it, and the product is Transistor. I've seen people refer to video games as a form of art before, but Transistor joins a miniscule list of games that I have played and feel as if I can share such a sentiment having played it.","August 4, 2014","true","14.8"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","32","38","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HawaiianApe/recommended/237930/","HawaiianApe","HawaiianApe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HawaiianApe/","488 products in account","Another banger by Supergiant Games.\n\nLet me start by saying that Transistor's music is absoultely fantastic. It's composed by Darren Korb (also did the soundtrack for Bastion) it has a futuristic feel to it with a little bit of Noir in there. It's also neatly integrated into the game and its story. The protagonist is a singer for crying out loud.\n\nHer name's Red, she's a singer, and her friend is now a talking sword. That's all you get at the begining of the game. Transistor's story is open ended, surprisingly heartfelt and imaginative. There are no clear-cut solutions or ideologies, the characters have their (sometimes questionable) motives, and it's hard to say what's what at times. The game is also very subtle about its themes. Very much like Bastion, you can speculate and fill in the gaps with your friends. Fun stuff.\n\nMuch like the story, the gameplay is brilliantly crafted and also very much open ended. Every bit of it is customisable, and the game makes you feel like you're in control of its systems. To simplify it- it's a real time action RPG. By pressing the right trigger you change it to a turn based structure, but it's more of a special power. The "turn" lasts only a short while but you can trample over the enemies without consequences as they are frozen in time, and you have a bunch of tools that can do the trampling.\n\nRed has a large selection of abilities to chose from, each ability has three functions- active, powerup and passive. You can attach unused abilities as powerups for the ones that are active, or you can use them as passive powerups for your statistics. Some abilities deal damage, some persuade, some create distance between you and the enemy, which you will need, as the enemies are tricky to handle (when they're not frozen in time that is). You will have to mix and match, see what works best, and then change it again. The game encourages experimentation- change your character's presets as many times as you want, it's easy and free of charge. The game's too forgiving? Obliterating enemies left and right? You can make the enemies harder and gain more experience. It's all customisable. Supergiant Games definitely built upon the already well made systems seen in Bastion and greatly improved them.\n\nHeck, the whole thing's really well made. And, well, gosh darnit. Ain't this the prettiest darn game I have ever laid my blue eyes upon. This game's graphics are something special, tell you hwat. Inspired by Art Deco, its futuristic vistas are just... Just beautiful. A little bit confuisng to get through at times perhaps, but with these looks, hey, who's complaining.\n\nThe only criticism I have is that its story is too short. Now don't get me wrong, the story is really well made and doesn't drag, but you can finish it in 5-6 hours. Now, that's great, I like a well made story, if it has to be around 6 hours to present itself the right way, the way the author intended, great. but you WILL want to play more of it after you've seen the ending, and it is a shame that you will have to start up New Game+ to do so.\n\nThe good news is that the New Game+ mode is really well made and has some additional stuff in it. Everything transfers and the difficulty ramps up. Heck, they even change up the enemy spawns, so it's definitely worth a second playthrough. Plus- there's no way you're going to reach the level cap during your first run through Thransistor, so there's a bunch of new stuff you'll get to play with.\n\nWell, that's a minor gripe, this is A+ material for sure. It's obvious that these guys know what they're doing, and every part of this game has been meticulously crafted with much passion and hard work. Whatcha gonna do next Kasavin? Cause whatever it is, I'm listening.","November 6, 2014","true","6.0"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","28","32","0","0"

There are some game breaking power combinations you can create that make it impossible to lose. The game is beautiful, the combat is interesting and what eventually really won me over, was the story. Towards the end of the game, you finally start understanding the story. It's not even that it is told to you, no, what happens is you get more and more of it via text in your powers, text in the limiters, just from everywhere. I didn't fully understand the impact of those until later.\n\nOnce you are done with your first run, you kind of question some things, so what do you do, you play again.

No.  However, it's a somewhat flawed game, at least from a gameplay standpoint.  First, the good.  The story is...largely unimportant/boring, but the characters and the world built in are amazing.  You feel very much drawn in with our silent heroine, Red, and her chatty admirer trapped in a cybernetic sword.  It creates a narrative experience where you are there more for how the characters and world interact than the story.\n\nGraphically, the game is quite distinctive.  Think Bastion meets Cyberpunk 2020 or Shadowrun.  It's very much a detective noir cyber punk world and feels dark, gothic, but also futuristic and techno.  The effects onscreen can be quite a sight to behold as well and the art style itself is quite beautiful, using 2-d hand drawn in conjunction with the sprites and 3-d action in combat.\n\nSound design is where the game shines.  An amazing voice cast, beautiful music which fits the mood perfectly, and relatively satisfying combat sounds make it a joy to listen to.  The tracks are good, but the vocal pieces in the beginning and end of the game are probably the best part of it.\n\nOne thing I will say about Transistor that I love and wish more games would do is it feels organic.  You have, for example, several areas that are completely unnecessary, not story related, and which you can skip, but not skipping them builds the world and the characters, feeling like we get to know them through their actions and choices.  Like ordering a pizza after trying to be murdered.  I'm dead serious and it actually ends up being a nice quiet moment between heroine and sword.  Also, Red can hum or flourish the sword, if for no other reason than because that's what the character would do, even if the gamer chooses not to.  Feels very much alive.  The world itself is very distinctive, even if it draws heavily from noir and cyberpunk.\n\nNow, the bad.  Like Bastion, it seems to go for an action RPG route where you can choose your moves in real time, with the option of a system freeze time, string together combos, and plan your battle more strategically.  This is where the game starts to suffer.  You cannot play one or the other.  Largely, the game requires you to use this "turn" system and when you use it, you are left vulnerable for up 5 seconds while a bar recharges.  You cannot attack and are slower than all the enemies and their projectiles, so the game is VERY frustrating at times in this regard.  Also, your health drains at an insane rate, even on the easy setting, and when it drains to zero, you lose one of the four moves you can map to the face buttons until you die.  At times, this will happen multiple amounts in battle and it takes several battles to recharge, as you can only recharge the lost abilities at specific points.  So, you may not die, but the game is very unbalanced in terms of what you can do and how much damage you take compared to the enemies.  It has an option to increase difficulty in exchange for more experience, like in Bastion, but honestly, the game feels not hard, but frustrating enough without it.\n\nThere is also an area like the Bastion which is meant to be a training/cooldown place, but...unlike the Bastion it feels kinda shoe horned in.  There seem to be several features, like the added difficulty, thrown in because "hey, we did it in Bastion and people liked that."  Standing on its own, without comparisons, it's...unnecessary, but inoffensive.\n\nOn the whole, I liked Transistor, despite the story not gripping me as much as the characters did and the gameplay being often very frustrating.  I'd say play Bastion first, because Bastion is just a better game, but if you're looking to kill 4-6 hours and the issues I mentioned with gameplay can be overlooked, the experience is well worthwhile.\n\nTransistor is flawed, but still a gem.\n","October 14, 2014","true","5.8"," 74 of 113 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","74","113","0","9"

It's seriously one of the most stunning games I've ever played. When I rank games in my head, listing them with all their faults in mind, all I can say is that Transistor is the ONLY game that I've played that has no faults.\n\nWhere do I start? Gameplay. Transistor does a fantastic job at letting you customize your moves. The pacing is fantastic- it does a very good job at easing the mechanics for you early on. For example, you start with a quick jab, and a long charging shot. Eventually you get an attack that is like a weak AoE. Pretty simple stuff, yeah? But then it tells you you can apply similar properties of powers to another, like combining them. Now your long-charge shot can split into multiples. And THEN you can apply powers to yourself, and not your other powers, to change up gameplay. The flexibility in powers allows for such a massively open-ended way to play. It's a simple 3-choice system that really allows the player to pick how they choose to play.\n\nThe story is pretty interesting. It's nothing fantastic enough to win awards, but the way that they present you the story makes it interesting. Cloudbank is a mysterious place, and their little terminals and hints in dialogue makes you keep guessing what it really is. The characters, though, are rather lackluster save for Red and the Transistor. There are only 3 voices in the game, and one of them is simple grunts and humming. The Transistor character, voiced by the same fantastic narrator from Bastion, is the main spotlight for his character. The other characters, the Camerata, aren't so fleshed out.\n\nThe art and sound styles are fantastic. This shouldn't really be a point to deter anyone, as these are just aesthetics. But when something is so stellar and outstandish in a game, I need to point it out. This game has STYLE. It's a beautiful, artsy, cyberpunk experience that's complete with everything that you need to keep you immersed.\n\nThere's really only one problem with this game. I want more. It's so good, but it's a straight-forward story game that won't take you longer than 10 hours. I want more of Cloudbank. I want more of the Transistor combat. I want more, more, more! The ending made me satisfied, but I was sad that it was over.\n\nDo yourself a favor. Buy this game. It's very, very good.","October 27, 2014","true","42.6"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","32","41","0","0"

The art and music are outstanding, though very similar to Bastion, as is the attention to detail.\n\nThere are loads and loads of programming references, which I found absolutely delightful, being a software engineer.\n\nYou don't have to be a software engineer to enjoy the game, though. Like Bastion, the game is perfectly accessible to anyone. It's been described as an RPG-lite, but there's plenty of gameplay complexity. The combat is a mix between ARPG and TBS.\n\nThere are even a few "puzzles" (game calls them "tests") thrown in, where you are challenged to win a fight by utilizing your abilities in specific ways. These tests are a way of educating you on the combat mechanics.\n\nThere's plenty of strategy involved, including the ability to make combat more difficult in exchange for a small exp bonus. I played at effectively the highest difficult setting and enjoyed the challenge. I'm probably going to continue through the second playthrough for additional challenge.\n\nThe first playthrough is fairly short, but never feels tedious, either. The second playthrough can be taken to extend play time by quite a bit. I like the game length. Some might complain about the price point, but I think it's fair for a quality indie title like this.\n\nThere are stability issues at the moment, but they are rapidly being patched, so I expect those to mostly be resolved soon. I mainly encountered problems with the optional "tests" deadlocking (?) and requiring manual process termination. Glancing at the forums, this seems to be related to the online features, which are understandably more difficult to test prior to release, so it's not exactly fair to ask "don't these people test their game?"\n\nAlso, there's not much character development and no real character interaction (though there's plenty of good voiceover). Some might miss that, but it didn't bother me. The focus is on atmosphere. I liked the way the game slowly revealed the backstory and made you work for some of it - revealing character biographies if you used your abilities in different ways.\n\nI liked the story, though I may be biased given the theme :)\n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend this.\n\nDisclaimer: I only played 30 minutes into Bastion so far, so I'm not very qualified to compare the two titles.

Throughout my 4 hours playthrough, never once did I feel that the map was bland.\n- Soundtrack. Just speechless. Darren Korb blew me away with the soundtrack in Bastion, and did it once again with Transistor.\n- The story was decent. It was simple enough and did not drag itself out for too long.\n- Took me 3.9 hours to complete the game. However, I did not do any challenges which would have extended the game by an hour or more.\n- The game's combat was not too easy and not too difficult. It never once made me feel like the game's combat was too easy to the point where it was basically cheating nor did it made me feel like the game's combat was too unfair and unforgiving.\n\nI felt that 3.9 hours was the sweet spot for me with this game.

Would they be able to recapture the magic with their sophomore release?  In short:  mostly.\n\nWhat made Bastion memorable to me was the music and atmosphere.  Mechanically solid, but aurally and visually delightful.  With Transistor they flip this a bit.  The real hook, the most fully formed part of the game, is the combat mechanics.\n\nMake no mistake, the audio is still miles ahead of most competitors.  Darren Korb does superb work with the music, though admittedly my tastes favor the folk blues of Bastion to the synth jazz of Transistor.  Logan Cunningham once again able to run laps around most voice acting in games.  Overall the entire atmosphere and audio portions of the game fall secondary to Bastion, but there is no shame in taking second to a game as strong as that.\n\nThe mechanics are the area where it stands on it's own.  They use a unique system of abilities, with each function able to take either the form of an ability, modifier for another ability, or passive support role.  The myriad ways these interact can lead to many tactical situation.  The game also strongly encourages mixing and experimentation, as the narrative is largely unlocked by using an ability in each of the 3 roles.  There doesn't seem to be any overpowering combo, though each can feel that way when used correctly.  Many games feature a wide array of abilities you can equip, but few do as good of a job encouraging you to experiment and resist using the same strategy throughout.\n\nOverall, a hearty recommendation.  While I rate it slightly lower than Bastion, their idea of a sophomore slump is still to embarrass the competition in writing and audio.","June 20, 2014","true","10.8"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelios/recommended/237930/","xelios","Xelios","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelios/","4978 products in account","From the creators of the beloved Bastion comes Transistor, a game in which you take on the role of Red, a musician living in the city of Cloudbank, whose voice has just been stolen during an attempt on her life. Red finds herself pulling a greatsword, Transistor, from the body of an acquaintance, whose consciousness has been transferred into it and can actively communicate with her through it. Transistor proceeds to serve as the narrator of the game and a contrast to the now-voiceless Red.\n\nTransistor is set in a technological era where pretty much everything can be digital, even one’s entire being, and disturbingly easy to take ownership of, manipulate or destroy. This technology has also brought certain comforts, and citizens find themselves voting on the weather and what color they’d prefer for the evening’s sunset. Cloudbank seems on its way to being a utopian society for its citizens until, one day, influential figures begin to disappear, one after another. An army of intelligent robots that serve as the city’s defense has been activated and begins… processing people. Red must fight her way through the Process to stop it, find who's causing the trouble and recover her voice.\n\nThe real stars of Transistor—sorry Red—are the function system and the hybrid battle system, where you can use abilities in real time and/or pause and plan your actions step by step on a tactical grid, then unpause to watch them unfold. Abilities, or functions as they’re called in the game, are absorbed by Transistor from the bodies of citizens you encounter as well as through leveling up. The function system is modular and synergistic, allowing you to mix and match and change your skills freely at checkpoints, with hundreds of potential combinations and effects.\n\nA simple attack function, such as Crash(), can be augmented with other functions so that it chains to additional enemies, charms them, has an added area of effect, fires more quickly, is more powerful, pulls enemies toward you, or becomes available for use in real time while your tactical turn is recovering. Each function may be used as an active skill, support for an active skill, and/or a passive skill. If, at some point, you attempt to research the strongest function combinations, you will find that almost every player has a different opinion; so many viable combinations is a hallmark of great design that doesn’t pigeonhole you into using cookie-cutter ability combinations throughout the entire game. This is where Transistor truly excels and the new game+ rewards you with additional copies of each function to play around with and more challenging encounters to test them out on. Self-imposed penalties called limiters, similar to the idols in Bastion, provide the option to challenge yourself further.\n\nEverything else in Transistor plays a supporting role to the combat system: The art is beautiful, but the locations are not very memorable and only serve to funnel you from one combat encounter to another; the soundtrack is solid but lacks a single track remotely as memorable as Bastion's vocal tracks; the narration takes a backseat because, although Transistor talks a lot, he really doesn’t have much of importance to say; characters other than Red and Transistor are never really fleshed out or present in the game other than to have their lives summarized in three-paragraph text dumps on the ability screen, where you’re left to decide their overall relevance and whether they should mean anything to you at all. The developers left a lot of holes for the player to fill and, whether this was intentional or not, for every player who manages to make sense where there seems none, another will be left scratching his head. Unlike in Bastion, additional narration of story elements does not take place during the optional challenges, which I feel is a missed opportunity to rectify this.\n\nFor me, Transistor was ultimately the story of two individuals amidst chaos and despair; everything else was incidental and incohesive, and I was unable to appreciate the story much at all until I looked at it this way. Confined to these two characters and their story, it was touching, with a powerful conclusion. Regardless of whether you come away from the story with anything meaningful, Transistor is still worth playing for the excellent combat.","August 24, 2014","true","19.4"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","22","26","0","0"

The game is set in a unique and engaging world, and a range of intriguing characters are regularly hinted at.\n\nDisappointingly, the story remains surprisingly lightweight given the cracker start, and the game finishes with both the world and the characters remaining enigmatic and unexplored.\n\nGameplay is primarily combat in a modified “real time with pause” style, which suits me great and has a ton of potential. You have the ability to combine a large number of different powers and effects, creating some genuinely interesting combinations. Unfortunately there is little variety in enemies, and consequently, combat lacks depth and replayability.\n\nI feel bad being critical about a game this good, but for a game only a few steps away from having been a genuine classic I can’t help but reflect on what might have been.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/recommended/237930/","doomsdayforte","DF","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/","936 products in account","Product received for free\n\nI received Transistor as a part of a between-friends Secret Santa gift swap and it took me around five and a half hours to get to the end once.  I used the Xbox 360 controller the whole time.\n\nA singer without a voice and a talking sword.  This duo has a front-row seat for what looks like the end of the world...  Transistor should feel familiar to those who played Bastion before since it too is an action RPG with an isometric angle.  Instead of landmasses floating in the sky, the setting is a city in the process of uncontrolled change.  And instead of a young man with an ever-growing arsenal of weapons, our heroine instead drags the titular Transistor behind her, and she uses that for a variety of attacks.\n\n"Red, we're not gonna get away with this, are we?" is the line that starts the game, spoken by the sword sticking out of a man to the woman standing over the two.  No backstory, no introductory cutscene, just this scene and cutting to gameplay as she takes the sword with her.  The sword knows where to go, so you move on...and then the cubes come and with them, enemies.  You start with two attacks and four slots to put them in to start, and you get more attacks through the story and as you level up.\n\nCombat's interesting because of the "Turn()" feature.  You can fight enemies in real time, but Red is no warrior and several attacks have windup times that leave her open.  Using Turn() stops time and allows you to queue movement and attacks that eat up your "planning" bar.  When you confirm your setup, Red will zip along and do all of the attacks at lightning speed as the enemies move at a snail's pace.  The tradeoff is that then you can't use any attacks until the planning bar refills, though you can move.  Red only has one movement speed, so using Turn() to approach, strike, and retreat is always a good idea.\n\nAnother neat thing about the combat is how your unused attacks can buff your other attacks or even Red herself.  Crash() is one of the starting moves, a basic melee-range attack that can stun enemies.  Applying it as an upgrade to another move makes that move stun.  Applying it as a passive reduces the damage Red takes as well as renders her immune to slowdown.  You eventually unlock two upgrade slots for your attacks and four passives for Red, but you have to mind the MEM limit taken up by your powers, each of which eats 1 to 4 MEM.  There are quite a few combinations to try out, and you can get interesting combos like a ranged AoE that charms and poisons anything it hits, or a summon that spawns two helpers that slowly heal you.\n\nAnother interesting thing is that all of the powers are tied to character bios and you unlock information as you use the power in the active, upgrade, and passive slots, though this is completely optional.  You get some background info as well as circumstances leading to their disappearances in the wake of the chaos going on, so the game indirectly pushes you to try new combinations.  The game also takes a different approach to lives.  You have a health bar that naturally depletes as you get hurt, and when it empties, you get fully recovered at the cost of losing access to the move that used the most MEM, and it won't come back until you visit a few save points.  Lose all four of your set powers and game over.\n\nI really liked the game's visual style, art deco mixed with digital aesthetic, giving it a weird retro-futuristic vibe.  The enemies are mostly white robotic constructs that attack you with lasers, there are white cubes that pop up to show an upcoming fight and to be used as cover, and you drag a big green sword behind you that looks a bit like a circuit board (which also leaves behind circuity sparks as you move).  The game feels like it could take place entirely in cyberspace, especially considering some of the prompts (finding the Transistor stuck in the man's chest reads "User: Logged Out"), but it's left ambiguous.  The music is great too, though I really took notice in a couple of places that play songs that Red wrote and performed in-universe, like "The Spine" playing when fighting the first Younglady at the big poster or "In Circles" gradually getting corrupted during the first boss fight.  Given Red is currently mute, the Transistor makes comments about the situation or the things you interact with.  I know the narrator in Bastion was pretty love it or hate it, but I didn't mind him and I never would've guessed it was the same guy voicing both characters.\n\nAs far as difficulty went, I found the game on the easy side, but that might've been due to the power combinations I used or prior experience with these kinds of games.  YMMV of course, but I only lost my health to the first boss once and the last one twice, though I came close a few other times.  If you know what you're doing and have a good setup of powers, you can probably handle anything.  The game slowly introduces you to new mooks to fight and their upgrades, at least.  The game is pretty short, as in, "one night of gaming" short.  It doesn't overstay its welcome, but I honestly wanted more.  There are optional challenges that give you a preset list of powers and tasks you with a mission such as "survive for 90 seconds" or "kill all enemies in one Turn()".  There's a New Game Plus feature where you go back through the story, fighting mooks in their strongest forms, and you can opt into the Limiters you unlock by leveling up which increase the enemy's powers in exchange for you getting more EXP out of fights, to the maximum level of 30.  You get another set of the same powers you earned the first time through, so you can really mix things up on the second loop.\n\nShort but sweet.  Transistor is a bit more than just Bastion: Cyberpunk, but those familiar with Bastion should find this a great fit.  It's pretty light on the RPG even though you level up, as you don't allocate stats and the biggest choices are which of the options you go for when you level up, not that you permanently lose anything you skipped.  It's pretty appealing for those who like customizing since there are 16 powers and you can combine any unique power together twice, so there are a lot of combinations to try out--and the game tracks which ones you've used at that!  Kinda wish the story was longer, but it wraps itself up nicely even if it's short.  There's some replay value but a lot of it comes from the optional challenges or just trying new combos to decimate your foes.\n\nYou'd probably like this one.","May 4","true","8.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

First of all, the art style is simply amazing. I mean did ya look at it? It's fabulous. Secondly, the soundtrack is WHOASH. You might end up not enjoying the game but still love it because of how good the music is. It's off the chain man.\n\nThe gameplay. Let's just say that it's a real sauce ball platter when it comes to this aspect. Transistor uses a battle system that is both unique and delicious to the stomach. It allows you to attack enemies in real time or using the neato "Turn" ability to plan out your attacks. Both options are viable and they are both quite satisfying.\n\nTransistor is not without it's flaws however. The game is pretty short only taking me around 7 hours to beat. The game is also extremely linear offering no sense of exploration. The game will keep you going on the path of destruction without much say. HOWEVER, transistor's replay value is boosted thanks to it's wide selection of weapons which allows you to experiment and find tons of different strategies and slam dunk homeruns to use throughout the game. So you don't get to explore the world much but you do get to explore your vast arsenal of abilities. Making different loadouts was pretty fun, and that's where a lot of the replay value was found for me.\n\nFor those of you who played Supergiant's last game Bastion, you should be right at home with the new role that voice actor Logan Cunningham plays in this game as the voice inside the transistor.  Similar to Bastion, the main character is silent and the voice in the transistor will speak for her as she journeys through the city of Cloudbank. It is a slightly different role compared to the role of the narrator from Bastion, but it is executed very well and at the end of the day I was just as impressed.\n\nThe story is also one of the biggest dunks this game has to offer. I found it very interesting and engaging, however once the game had ended, I was left with many unanswered questions that were never resolved.  This may annoy some players, but I actually found it refreshing that the game challenges you to think about these questions and come up with interpretations for yourself.\n\nAt the end of the day, this game is GODLIKE.  For those of you who are looking for a large amount of content in this game, the 20$ price tag may be too steep. And that is okay, but I believe that this game is such an awesome experience that the price tag is justified even if it doesn't last you as long as most games.\n\nSo yeah, Transistor gets a rating of "11/10 reverse gorilla dunk". Thank you for your time.","June 12, 2014","true","28.5"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/237930/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","When I first looked at Transistor I thought it would be somewhat similar to Bastion. It had the same graphic style, an isometric view and a narrator (which is actually a 'character' this time; in the form of a talking sword). But, I'm happy to say that I couldn't be more wrong.\n\nYes, it has all of the features I just mentioned but it's not just a simple copy. There's so much more going on here. Transistor has a deep (and a little bit confusing) story and a combat system that as equally deep. The lore reminded me of Dark Souls where you have to piece things together yourself and not everything is trying to be explained.\n\nThe graphics are amazing, but are, unfortunately, this time limited to full HD resolutions and not anything higher. Despite that it all still looks like art, and it really is eye candy. Absolutely wonderful.\nThe narrator is doing a great job as far as the voice acting goes, even if it's a bit stiff and sometimes feels unemotional. The music and sounds are all excellent as well.\n\nLet's get back to the combat system for a minute. Like pretty much any RPG out there, your character will level up after several battles and once you level up you're allowed to choose a certain skill and passive upgrade. When you first start it's just that, a skill. But level up a few times more and you'll have several skills. This time, however, skills can be combined to make an even more effective/deadly combination. So, for example, let's say that you chose the skill to teleport in an instant. Combine it with Charm (which temporarily transforms an enemy into an ally) and you'll be zipping across the map converting enemies, making your battles much easier. This was just a poor example, by the way (blame my memory !). Of course, this also works the other way around, resulting in entirely different skills every time. It's a blast to play with and it's even more fun to experiment with these new skills on real enemies. You'll see that certain combinations will do ridiculous amounts of damage and that others, while still being useful, need some slight tweaking in order to be effective. It's pure brilliance.\n\nTransistor is on the short side, however, and it can easily be finished in 5-6 hours. I think I explored every area carefully in my playthrough, but I didn't do most of the (optional) challenges. So I think you can add another 2 hours to my numbers if you want to do all of those. And after that, you can start New Game+ with all your current skills intact (which will make the battles more fun right from the start).\n\nIn the end Transistor is nothing but a brilliant, deep little game. If you call yourself a serious gamer you should absolutely play this. I liked it even better than Bastion, and that's definitely saying something.\n\n[Rating: 91/100]","May 31, 2014","true","9.7"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","1"

The game has everything I adored about Bastion with a deeper disposition.\n\nThe game's combat system features both real time and tactical elements which I feel does wonders for varied playstyles. The function combination system also gives you a ton of choices seeing as you can mix and match 16 different functions as actives, passives, and upgrades.\n\nThe musical quality of the game is also quite excellent. It goes beyond what you would expect as far as ear candy goes. I also noticed that compared to Bastion, the songs in this game have a more direct message. They're not just catchy, they really fit into the story. If you think the soundtrack for this game is stellar, wait until you hear the humming added in!\n\nHere's a sample:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5slhV7pUNf4\n\nAs far as the story goes, Transistor really runs it deep. There are large gaps in the game that I still don't understand even after completing everything (while reading/listening to all interactables). I feel these gaps (some of which are open to interpretation) should at least be partially expanded on. Despite this, the game did not disappoint. I just wish they had alternate endings like they had with Bastion.\n\n10/10 - Everything about the game was very good, but the 10 rating comes from the insanely captivating music.

The RPG part is the usual leveling and acquiring of various attacks and abilities. The tactical side has you planning your moves and attacks during your 'turn' and during 'their turn' you run away. An interesting aspect in this game is that any ability can be used as an active ability, A passive ability or as an enhancement to an active ability. Gives a lot of different combinations to play with and the game encourages you to try them all out. It's also the main reason I'm considering playing again immediately. Something I rarely do.\n\nStory wise, You're Red, A super pop star, and something bad happens. Fortunately your over-sized all-purpose weapon talks to you and fills you in on what's going on. Well, The talking stick doesn't tell you everything. A lot of background is given through text and I found the setting it painted compelling. So much so that I wanted to explore and experience more of the city. I kind of interpreted that as a reflection of Reds' yearning for a part of her life that has been interrupted. I saw the fatalistic vibe as Reds' also.\n\nVisually the city is pleasing, clean and precise. While the more personal moments are done in a nice watercolor style. The music, Except for one stand out song, seems mostly ambient. Though there are some excellent subtle things done to the music, I wished it wasn't so subtle. Something to save for the next game perhaps.\n\nOverall, While the gameplay is excellent, The narrative seems more like an interesting experiment if not entirely successful. But I'll be there for SuperGiants next game sight unseen.","August 15, 2014","true","37.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","2"

Videogames have tried to take that spot over the years, ofering now a great tool for writers and devs to reach their audience in ways movies can't.\nThis level of inmersion is often used to put the player in other character's shoes, offering experiences with more or less background. Transistor favours the storytelling in spite of some of this inmersion, making the player an observer, not giving you absolute control, getting carried by the events, giving  you a broader view of what it has to deliver. And what a way to deliver it.\nTransistor executes flawlessly everything it attempts. It doesn't offer you the latest in graphics, the best music or the most action-packed gameplay, but it makes sure you enjoy every last bit of it. Don't take me wrong, the hand drawn graphics look gorgeous, the music is great and the gameplay is very, very enjoyable, but it's the way it delivers it to the player, what makes Transistor one of the very best games I've ever played. And I've been around since the 80's.\nThe game takes all the good things from Bastion, all kinds of influences from our day, and builds a vivid, original world, so full of life and personality it makes everything else look so run-of-the-mill, so old and used. It tells the oldest Story ever told, a Tragedy. But it's the characters, the world they inhabit, the references to our world, the little details, the pauses, the many readings anyone can take from this story... It's more than just a game, just a story. It's an interactive piece of art.\n\nTo sum it all up, don't miss this experience if you're looking for something else than quick, mindless fun in a game, because you'll be missing a classic. This game is gonna be high up in the history of videogames, at least as one of those "hidden gems", and will bring you memories (and probably a smile) when you stumble upon it in some years.\nIndie games are offering new, fresh, great ideas and masterpieces like Transistor only proves that it's a very good time to be a gamer, enjoy it while it lasts.","May 23, 2014","true","22.6"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","5"

There was a lack of enemy variety, and no real strategy needed to get by them.  Bosses were kind of a pushover too.\n\nEven tho I found this game disappointing, I'll likely give future games from the developer a shot.  Despite my complaints listed above, I enjoyed the actual gameplay mechanics.  The upgrade system was kinda neat and I liked testing out different combinations of attacks you get.

Bastion had extremely tight and hugely enjoyable gameplay, and it seemed like Transistor was discarding that for a slowed down, more strategic approach. I could not have been any more wrong.\n\nTransistor provides a system that is pretty easy to learn and grows in complexity and versatility as you progress, allowing you to really tailor your abilities to how you want to play. Unused abilities become modifiers for your equipped abilities or modifiers for your character herself, allowing you to constantly alter your playstyle. You pick the pace at which you fight, choosing whether to focus on fighting in real time, or relying more on using the “time freeze” mechanic to stop time and allow you to plan a whole flurry of attacks in quick succession.\n\nRegardless of this flexibility in playstyle, if your health hits zero, instead of dying and starting over, you lose one of your abilities randomly. This serves an elegant two fold purpose. On one hand, it provides punishment for the player who failed to stay alive, removing an ability that that player specifically wanted to use. On the other hand, because that ability is now removed from the game for a while, the player is forced to mix and match and experiment with whatever abilities are left in the ability pool. To stay alive, the player must adapt.\n\nAnd there is some satisfaction to be had from being forced to adapt. By forcing your hand, Transistor challenges your creativity, your willingness to change the way you think or to try something new. It sits on the precipice of balancing hugely gratifying gameplay with a breathtaking world and a resonating story, and does not disappoint.\n\nYou should probably go buy it.","October 31, 2014","true","14.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Woot woot, the same narrator from Bastion!\nThe difference: the combat system is not quite the same as Bastion's. It's not so much a hack & slash, as much as it is a *tactical* combat-system game.  Ahh how to explain this..? It's quite unique.\nThere is a 'time-stop' system which allows you to literally -pause- to analyze and plan out your combat moves in advance. Each ability and number of steps you take around the "field" require a certain amount of 'energy' - so you are limited by an energy bar and its refresh system.  Therefore, you have to be efficient in not only the abilities you choose, but your movements across the "combat field", etc.  It's remniscent of other games to me that I had enjoyed very much.. so that was not an issue for me, personally! -- it was quite a delight. :)\nWhat I especially enjoyed was the way that you can experiment with and mix up all the different abilities you pick through leveling up. Each combination results in something different, and you can only have 4 active ones in combat. You can literally mix 2-3 learned abilities together for one unique ability / result - so there are multiple possiblities.  You also have passive ability-slots which you can use those ability cards for, as well, and they play a completely different role.  There is quite a flexible customization system. :)\nAlso, if / everytime your HP goes to '0' in combat, you lose and are disabled from one of your 4 abilities; which you can only recover at a later time. :o Additionally, if you want to challenge yourself further, you are able to raise the difficulty by implementing an in-game system called "limiters" -- a very similar system to Bastion.  The more limiters you use, the more rewards (more xp). Funfun!\n\nAll in all, I loved the game so much that I took my time with it and did not want to rush through it.  I recommend that you don't either to enjoy the narration, soundtrack, and immersiveness for the total experience. Luckily, there is an option for a second playthrough so you can have the opportunity to level up some more and unlock abilities you had missed out on before and try different combinations! :)","May 23, 2014","true","18.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","3"

The first one being Bastion, this game has big shoes to fill. Lucky for us, Transistor is every thing we expected from the creators of Bastion, with a few nuggets of surprise thrown in.\n\nTransistor, like Bastion, is a top down isometric RPG, that features amazing visuals and audio. Unlike Bastion, Transistor is a pseudo-Turn based RPG, the melds turn based mechanics with real time combat. The combat system overall feels familiar, but fresh, and original at the same time.\n\nI think it goes with out saying, that this game is gorgeous in every was possible. Amazing illustrations, backgrounds, composition, color pallet, and the sound design matches the visual in quality. It's just a top shelf experience that you won't find in other games.\n\nAll this is great, but keep in mind that Transistor is fairly short, and there's not a lot of incentive to come back to the game other than the possibility that you'll like it enough for a 2nd play through. So for those who are feature, or length centric, consider this your warning. But do keep in mind, when approaching games like Transistor, you're not paying for the amount of game you get, but the quality of game you'll get to experience.\n\nPros:\n- Incredible quality in visual and audio\n- Unique blend of game mechanics\n- Piles of attention to detail\n- An experience all gamer's should have\n\nCons:\n- A little short\n- Very light on content","June 28, 2014","true","25.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The fighting is innovative and clever and makes you want to try out all the combinations.\n\nThe game is not without flaws though - it is highly linear and constantly pushes you through the quite short story arc.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/suspectfenster/recommended/237930/","suspectfenster","fenster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/suspectfenster/","150 products in account","Transistor is a game developed by Supergiant Games, who are well known for their stylistic action game Bastion.  Transistor definitely borrows from Bastion's strongest suits; notably it is brilliantly compsed and absolutely beautiful.  The story is extremely esoteric (certainly moreso than Bastion), but not unsatisifying.\n\nWhere it differs from Bastion is mostly in gameplay; Transistor still is still an action/RPG where you traverse levels, attack bad guys, and level up, but the game plays much slower almost as a strategy game would.  Enemy encounters are isolated and you can use a "Turn" to essentially stop time and plan out your attacks, which will then carry out in nearly zero time.  Just like Bastion, you're offered a plethora of ways to deal with enemies.  Instead of weapons, you use "functions", which are essentially castable spells and abilities   Each ability can combo with other abilities to alter them, or can be used in a passive slot to provide a permanent buff.\n\nThe result is an insane amount of combinations, and you are incentivied to explore them because using abilities in different ways unlocks more information about the story and the characters which are a part of it.  In Bastion I found myself finding a weapon that I really liked and sticking with it for the rest of the game (even though many weapons are equally viable).  The story mechanic in Transistor subtlely pushes you to try different combinations, and in doing so, you often stumble into even better combinations that you probably wouldn't have realized existed otherwise.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend Transistor.  Most fans of Bastion should enjoy it -- although the amazing art and music is immediately noticable, it is definitely a slower burn in terms of gameplay and the early parts of the game take a little while to get into.  As more abilities and the true nature of the game unveils itself though, it is very well executed and an absolute joy.","July 26, 2014","true","9.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/recommended/237930/","ashdot","Callietrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/","1456 products in account","This game surprised me to hell and back. Seriously.\n\nWord of Note: At the time of writing, I have not beaten the game. This "Review" is more of a "First Impressions" than a proper review, so please keep in mind that the game may have a few more surprises down the line that may completely change the gameplay or atleast alter it drastically! Review will be updated accordingly after I beat the game if anything new pops up.\n\n*I also won't summarize the Premise of the Game's Story as the game itself starts you out completely in the Blank and shows you what happened.\n\nVisual-wise, pretty dang amazing, albeit a few scaling issues with buildings and such. This game is the epitome of low-poly modeling and hand painted textures. The enemy models and landscapes are very simple looking as far as modeling goes, but the assets/textures used on everything gives the world life even if the places are deserted, it invokes a tone of lonelyness and helps you figure out somewhat, what exactly happened that there's not a single soul around. When Red moves around and drags the Transistor (Sword) it leaves a trail on the ground that disappears shortly after, but helps mark direction, additionally, some moves can leave holes in the ground depending, and won't disappear until it's replaced by the same "break' textures elsewhere. Enemies themselves are presented as robotic creatures and are reminiscent of Kingdom Heart's Nobodies in that same way - as creatures sent to hunt your player character, but are mindless in nature.\n\nThe Soundtrack is also quite a treat! Boasting pretty impressive Lyrical compositions that gives it a bit of a Noire feeling and are pretty well varied. Additionally, Red can hum alongside any given track, effectively making a sort of "remix" to that particular song. Soundwork is also pretty well done, the Transistor does it's charging noises, it clings and clangs when slamed unto the ground, there's a subtle noise for steps, for the trail the sword leaves and enemies make their odd creature like noises when they're going after you. Voices are also excellently done. Red doesn't speak, but you can hear her sing in some flashbacks, the Transistor also serves as a sort of narrator to help divulge neat little extras. Something the game does, that I really dig, is that the way he speaks to Red, sort of feels like he's talking to the player aswell, giving it a 4th wall kinda feeling. It's all amazing.\n\nThe game also fares pretty well, if a little slow and methodical. This is the part that may make or break the game for a lot of people, for sure. Red moves VERY slow, it's done on purpose though, as areas in general are subdivided via "zones" and they aren't very large in scale either. The game's Battle Structuring is simple, but feels a tad linear in execution (atleast at the start) where enemies ambush you in certain parts of a Zone but won't respawn after a battle ends and you walk back into the area.\n\nCombat is where the gameplay really shines. The battles play out sort of like Crisis Core, once you enter combat mode, you're trapped inside the zone until enemies are defeated. Enemies will be mercilessly going after you, and you have just the one Health Bar to tide you over the entire battle, if your health bar depletes, you will lose a "Function" instead of dying.\nDuring combat, your attacks depend solely on the Functions you have picked out and set up. Each function, obtained either through finding people that died or leveling has multiple functions. This gives the game a LOT of depth as far as building your character goes. You have 4 main slots to assign a Function too, and those slots have 2 extra slots that you can assign more functions to to power up that function - * * * example: You can have a function that shoots out grenade like particles in an area, you have another function that, by itself, creates a bomb in place that needs to be self detonated, however, you can add that function to the previously mentioned function to add, let's say explosive attributes which come via the way of damage buffs, range buffs, etc * * * You can continously build more and more powerful functions to use to kill your foes, move faster, avoid attacks while dealing damage, etc, there's I believe, TONS of ways to build the character you want and fight the way you want.\nWhen fighting, the Combat Areas have little grey squares, these serve as your main method of avoiding attacks. You can destroy these squares yourself or the enemy can. During Major Boss battles, this is very important to keep track of, as bosses can deal a TON of damage and are very patternized. You also have the "Turn" Command, which freezes the entire battle field and let's you plan out attacks ahead of time, this can also be used to avoid attacks. The Turn command works via a queing system - Imagine you have a time slider and you're editing it with the stuff you want Red to do, wether it is move away or closer to an enemy, use specific Functions to continously attack an enemy, avoid an enemy, or both. It is, however, not 100% accurate, as while you're in turn mode you continously set Red to Attack the enemy in a specific area, but the enemy CAN still move when combat resumes and avoid your attacks, thus giving the combat a ton of strategic aspects to it. Turn mode is balanced due to the way you're forced to wait until the turn slider returns to normal, when you deplete the Turn Bar, you CANNOT attack or use any function, so keep that in mind always, and don't use Turn Mode haphazardly as it can leave you VERY vulnerable after usage.\n\nPros:\n+Amazing Soundtrack\n+Amazing Hand Painted/Digital looking world\n+Amazing looking Particle effects to compliment the already awesome looking world\n+Expansive and Deep "Functions" System\n+Amazing Voice Work and Sound Effects.\n+Surprisingly deep combat with a large strategic element to it.\n+Communicates it's Atmosphere amazingly.\n+Great enemy designs help the atmosphere even further.\n+Surprisingly well designed and written Main Character.\n\nCons\n-Minor Scaling issues with Buildings and structures\n-Red moves a little methodical and slow\n-Combat Structure feels a little linear (At time of Writing)","May 23, 2014","true","0.9"," 21 of 34 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","21","34","0","5"

The oversaturated, colorful art style combined with the ethereal soundtrack provide an incredible feel for the game.\n\nThe art is incredibly colorful, ranging from extremely warm to extremely cool, and it's all hand-painted. The "cutscenes" (if you can refer to them as that) are incredibly beautiful, and prompted me to take several screenshots in order to preserve them. Red's character design is excellent, and the enemy models and city are both really creative and interesting. A lot of cyberpunk art is cool, hard, metallic; you don't see that here. There's a lot of blur, a lot of soft edges, a ton of bloom. It's a game bursting with color.\n\nIf you've read any of my other reviews, you already know that music and sound design play a big part in shaping the experience for me. This game has both in spades. The excellent soundtrack ranges from jazzy and uptempo, to soft and bluesy, to straight downtempo ambient. The sound design is utterly phenomenal. When paused, the game continues playing the background music, but at a slower tempo, and muffled, as if  it were being played inside a car next to you with all of the windows and doors sealed tightly. Click out of the game's window, and you get a very quiet, bassy hum in the background. I've got the game paused in another window as I type this review, and I feel the quiet bass rattling on and off in the cans even now. It's a really phenomenal effect. Whoever worked sound on this title definitely earned their wages.\n\nThere's also an extremely simple, yet very likeable feature that causes Red to hum along to the background music merely by holding down a button. This is just as simple as it sounds, yet I found myself sitting for minutes on end with the left bumper on my controller compressed; mesmerized and staring into my screen as my focus slowly deteriorated.\n\nI feel like I'm floating in a hot tub while on drugs when I play Transistor. It's that kind of game.\n\nAs someone with an overclocked 1440p display the lone criticism I have with the game is the lack of 1440p support, but this qualm is rendered moot by the fact that these are hand-painted designs. It's difficult to justify creating these designs with a 1440p resolution in mind considering how small of a userbase it is, so I can forgive Supergiant for locking the display at 1080p. That's what the art looks best at, and I experienced the game at this resolution in windowed mode.\n\nIt has a voice acting schtick similar to the narrator in Bastion, though in Transistor it takes the form of a speaking sword rather than a narrator. So if you liked that kind of thing in Bastion, you'll like it here. The voice acting is very well-done, but it rubs me a bit wrongly; about half of the lines feel like they're jammed into the game in a very hamfisted manner. I seem to be the only one who felt that way about Bastion, though, so take this criticism of Transistor for what it's worth.\n\nThe core gameplay is your basic isometric action RPG stuff with a couple of neat concepts thrown in. The ability to pause the game and plot out your next actions -- which happen extremely quickly and automatically once you unpause -- is a key aspect in what keeps the combat from becoming a bit stale. There were plenty of times when I felt I didn't have enough control over where my attacks were headed. Certain "functions", as the game calls your attacking skills, felt like they were a bit too hard to properly line up, and as a result I frequently missed some enemies I should have been hitting. But the nifty pausing function takes care of most of it, and it looks really cool. It makes you feel like the badass that Red is supposed to be.\n\nThe other thing I really liked, and the thing that kept me playing most, was the ability to junction functions into each other in order to modify their actions. You have a set amount of function attack and actions and only four slots in which to place them. Each function has an active ability that becomes usable when placed, but they also have a specific modifying ability when junctioned into another active function. This all seems complicated when I write it out, but it's really fairly easy to understand in the game; no tutorial is really necessary after a few minutes of tinkering with it. The combinations are almost literally endless, and I found myself constantly resetting them in order to try new ones. It really adds some meat and some depth to a game that I felt would have easily succeeded on its artistic merits without these systems.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd say this game is worth a few hours of play simply for the art style and the soundtrack. But the neat combat and function features here will keep you coming back for far longer than that. This is a very worthwhile experience and Supergiant Games continues to offer some really unique, polished, artistic gaming experiences.","June 29, 2014","true","11.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Very nicely done.\nNever played the previous game "Bastion", but after playing this I may have to pick it up, too.\n\nWell in this game you are controlling Red. Explore the cloudbank and fight against evil process using functions. You can and have to combine your various functions to get the best from your character.\n\nStory is not too hard, the first level are challenging, because you don't have many functions. You can even start a NG+ to start over with more functions.\nDuring your visit, you can do some "tests". Basicly they are challenges to teach you a better way to use your abilities. They are easy, except the performance tests.

Maybe I shouldn't even compare Bastion and Transistor because Supergiant Games might wanted do something different... Anyways.\n\nYou start right away in middle of the game and the story. The setting is a Sci-Fi world, more precisely I guess it's something like an online world.\nIn Transistor you experience the story chronologically. In the beginning there are some minor gaps, which get filled soon. The story catches you and you want to know what happens next. Nevertheless, to be honest I have to say that I liked the story of Bastion better but the story of this game is not bad at all!\n\nThe gameplay is quite cool. Transistor's gameplay contain some nice features that underline the story and the atmosphere. That includes electing something on a terminal or some breaks for the protagonist. These breaks are implemented as beautiful pictures.\n\nWhat I liked the most is the combat system.\nTime to time you get more attacks and can combine these like you want. This mixing provides a great variety to fighting in Transistor. Also, there is a "plan mode" in which you can plan moves and then perform then fast. That looks very cool and is fun too.\nLastly, you can, as well as in Bastion, increase the difficulty on your own.\n\nSupergiant Games games always catch you with their atmosphere so I didn't write anything about the atmosphere here.\n\nOkay, I can not write this review without mentioning Darren Korb and his great job on composing marvellous songs for this game. The music matches perfectly to the game and is an essential part of it, just like in Bastion.\n\nI come to the conclusion that Transistor is another awesome game by Supergiant Games. It's a perfect game that doesn't need improvements at all! If you liked Bastion or you want to play something different but brilliant buy Transistor now!","November 24, 2014","true","13.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

[deaf]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NG-Allison/","276 products in account","Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing\nFor Deaf/hoh gamers, I rate this game a 10/10!\n\nOverall GameSupergiant knocked it out of the park again.  In Transistor, you play as Red, a lady whose voice was stolen by a group who intended to kill her.  Obviously that's a bit odd, but the game takes place inside of a computer-ish environment.  Telling more would be giving things away for those who, for some reason, have yet to play it.\n\nSince this review is largely oriented toward acciessibility for deaf/hoh gamers, I will stop there and just say that it is a great game with a great story that has significant replay value both in terms of further understanding the story and additional challenges, as the game gets harder on additional playthroughs.\n\nMy overall rating for gameplay experience is 10/10. :D\n\nGeneral AccessibilityThis game has been called semi-isometric.  Basically, you control Red in an angled-down view using WASD, Q for a 'flourish,' and the number keys 1-4.  In place of WASD, you can left click to have Red go somewhere.\n\nFor mobility-related issues, you have the option of keyboard/mouse OR a controller, and the game can realistically be played using real-time combat and the Turn() function or just through Turn(), though it is slightly harder, since the enemies will still attack outside of your Turn() actions.  Further, all keys can be rebound.\n\nTurn() basically pauses combat so that you can plan and execute an attack using 'movement points.'\n\nFor overall accessibility, I give Transistor a 10/10.\n\nSubtitles & CaptionsTransistor starts with subtitles turned off, so make sure you enable them before playing.  As the game has no opening cinematics prior to the start menu, you will not miss any of the story.\n\nSubtitles appear at the top of the screen in very large, clear, outlined text.  No concerns with white-on-white or otherwise unreadable subtitles.  Further, subs are colored according to who is talking and images accompany the voices to indicate the speaker.  In scenes with multiple speakers, nobody is shown actually talking on screen, so there are no concerns with differentiating on-screen vs off-screen subtitles.\n\nAlthough I was confused when I first started playing, when you see off-white captions with no indication of the speaker, pay attention to the sword glowing.  Since Red has no voice, the sword is the speaker, and it acts as a narrator-in-being in the game, pushing the story along by talking to Red.\n\nRed actually uses the OVC terminals to talk back to the sword via typing, so you can consider that a shoutout to TTYs or using text/notepad on a smartphone to communicate.\n\nFor its effective use of subtitles that leaves no confusion about the speaker or the story, I rate this category a 10/10.\n\nChatting/CommunicatingTransistor is a single-player game.  No chatting or voice comms exist.\n\nNo rating!","December 19, 2014","true","47.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The oversaturated, colorful art style combined with the ethereal soundtrack provide an incredible feel for the game.\n\nThe art is incredibly colorful, ranging from extremely warm to extremely cool, and it's all hand-painted. The "cutscenes" (if you can refer to them as that) are incredibly beautiful, and prompted me to take several screenshots in order to preserve them. Red's character design is excellent, and the enemy models and city are both really creative and interesting. A lot of cyberpunk art is cool, hard, metallic; you don't see that here. There's a lot of blur, a lot of soft edges, a ton of bloom. It's a game bursting with color.\n\nIf you've read any of my other reviews, you already know that music and sound design play a big part in shaping the experience for me. This game has both in spades. The excellent soundtrack ranges from jazzy and uptempo, to soft and bluesy, to straight downtempo ambient. The sound design is utterly phenomenal. When paused, the game continues playing the background music, but at a slower tempo, and muffled, as if  it were being played inside a car next to you with all of the windows and doors sealed tightly. Click out of the game's window, and you get a very quiet, bassy hum in the background. I've got the game paused in another window as I type this review, and I feel the quiet bass rattling on and off in the cans even now. It's a really phenomenal effect. Whoever worked sound on this title definitely earned their wages.\n\nThere's also an extremely simple, yet very likeable feature that causes Red to hum along to the background music merely by holding down a button.

Not because it was a magical journey full of adventure but because it was so short and I saw so little. Most of the gameplay was in the little sandbox area with the progressively more difficult challenges. Carries a lot of the more subtle aspects from Bastion (one chocolate velvet voice talks to you, similar artstyle and music, similar storytelling mechanics). The narration is a bit more creepy though since it's your sword talking and it's hitting on you, not even in an overtly hilarious machismo way either. Imagine swinging groose around as he yelled "THE GROOSE IS LOOSE"  and other hilarious one liners while you pummeled your enemies. Also the protagonist needed to be more attractive. You can't depict a futuristic pop idol without making her look F-I-N-E, but the devs were probably ♥♥♥♥♥whipped into making her look normal as to not offend the types of idiots who get pissy at spiderman alt cover comics.\n\nGameplay. Isometric hack and slash with an ever increasing number of attacks and methods for combining aspects of said attacks with others. Difficulty enables you to make the enemies arbitrarily more challenging to dispatch (rewarding you with more exp). This part was wonderful in that you weren't constantly just using the one newly acquired better-than-what-you-had-before weapon like in Bastion (you would pretty much never want to use the early weps end game but here they're still useful in tandem with other weapons).\n\nIt's pretty good but there's an underlying tone that has me wanting to avoid starting this game up. Once it's going I naturally progress but just starting it is so trying.","September 6, 2014","true","13.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Em_TC/recommended/237930/","Em_TC","Em","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Em_TC/","135 products in account","Oh, Transistor.\n\nI went into this game assuming it was, like so many have said, a mere 6 hour jaunt. The impression often given is that that's all there is to Transistor; sure, it's visually and musically stunning, and its narrative is engaging, but ultimately many will say that 6 hours (give or take an hour) is all there is to it. I disagree, and not just because subjective, arbitrarily determined gameplay durations are generally a poor gauge of quality game content in the first place.\n\nMy first playthrough took me about 11 hours, 12 if you count my various AFK'ing and tabbing out pauses. However, I didn't just play through the story from start to finish. I completed the extra challenge "tests" that introduced me to abilities I may not have realized were useful otherwise; I explored every area, read news terminals, and unlocked some of the additional "function" (ability) file details. All of these served to greatly expand my understanding of the game's setting and characters. It is this that gets me to the point of my review. There is more to Transistor than just the story that's on the surface. Just getting to the "end" of the game will not give you an explicit understanding of its story.\n\nMeticulously placed throughout the beautiful environments, the well-voiced dialogue, the amazing music -- even some of the function names -- are subtle hints, easter eggs, and pointers to details about the game's setting, story and characters that are often not addressed directly anywhere else. This game is very much about (subtly) showing you, NOT outright telling you. Days after I had first beaten the game, I was still going through my screenshots, still pondering the meaning behind some of the music's lyrics, and still reading others' interpretations. This was all in an attempt to absorb more of what the game has to offer, to gain even more insight into perhaps the best, most enjoyable and satisfying aspect of the game for me -- what was NOT said, what was NOT blatantly pointed out, and was instead left there for me to find on my own or to speculate about later. And my second playthrough... well. I don't think I've ever jumped right back into a game for a new playthrough so soon after finishing it. And then even the fact that the game's "new game+" option was instead referred to as a "recursion" turned out to have some significance.\n\nSo yes, the game's art style is gorgeous. Its soundtrack is one of the best game soundtracks I've ever listened to. Its combat system is intricate and greatly rewards planning ahead and experimenting. It is all of these things, and you can go through a straight start-to-finish playthrough and enjoy every bit of that. But if you're the type of player who likes to ask a lot of questions about the specifics of a game's plot or characters, who isn't always merely satisfied with the obvious, and who appreciates a game that lets you connect some of the dots on your own, you'll very likely get even more out of Transistor than you thought you would.\n\nP.S.: Yes, the soundtrack is absolutely worth purchasing.

The last few years I have only got this feeling from two games, the first one was The Banner Saga, and now Transistor. This is a game that when I sit down playing it I don't wanna stop, but I dont really want to continue either, because i'm thinking: The game is probably quite short.\n\nHowever, for this story the amount of time was perfect, not to short and definitely not to long.\nThis is a very interesting RPG-game with a deep love story, in a city where very weird things are going on.\nI must say that at first I was very confused, but the longer I played it the longer I was drawn into the story and into the world of Transistor.\n\nTogether with the exellent art-style and magnificent soundtrack this game made made me more immersed than what I usually get in games, atleast since I got older. I remember that I as a kid more often got this feeling, the feeling I got from Banner saga and now Transistor. I guess that is because I get used to it, to the way games play and the way a gaming story most often adapts.\n\nRomance or more rather love is a huge part of the story, or it basically is and I don't feel many games use that as their spine. More games should, since it's a powerful tool to usurp our feelings. I want my feelings to get usurped by games, I really do.\n\nThis game has two main characters, one is Red, a strong female character who are fighting to get back her voice, which was stolen from her by Camerata, which is a group you don't know much about, but their intentions were at first good, but power might have corrupted them. The other protagonist is "the" Transistor, the weapon Red uses. who throughout the game is trying to help you as much as possible.\n\nThe fighting is very interesting, as you play you will find more and more moves, or attacks that you can use during these fights. You can fight as time goes, or you can enter this... "V.A.T.S" system (If you know Fallout 3 & NV) where you get to plan your moves ahead of you and then fire them all at once without the enemy having the time to respond. However that leads to a cooldown so you can't attack for a few seconds after. I found this system very usable at times, but mostly I tend to... forget it? Or maybe I just don't appriciate it enough. It has helped me sure, but I want to kill the enemy "myself" If that makes sence.\n\nWhenever you get beaten enough you'll lose some attacks, which will return later on when another cooldown has counted down to zero. The most interesting part with the attacks are that you can put them together, you can strenghen one by adding the others, that however cost a few points so at the same time you have to look at a bar that show you how much points you've spend on this. While leveling up you can choose to increase that bar, or add another support slot for your weapon, etc.\n\nI would dearly recommend this game to anyone who would like to try something different, but still very beautiful and worthwhile.","January 4, 2015","true","5.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

When I heard SuperGiantGames was making another Bastion-esque game, I was not very happy, to be honest. I saw the trailers, and thought it looked too similar to Bastion, and assumed they were putting their entire budget into marketing. Gladly, I was very wrong. Transistor is only similar to Bastion in its base style (top down, hand drawn). The gameplay has been improved, the art style is completely different, and the music is just as good as it was in Bastion. Now, I'm sure I will still like Bastion better, simply because I played it first and am therefore somewhat bias, but if you remove any comparison from your mind, you are left with a unique, enjoyable, and artistic game with a fantastic story.\n\nAlso, I am very impressed that there are no bugs or glitches, as I am playing on day one. That's not to say you might not have problems, but it seems that with my somewhat abnormal setup, I tend to take the brunt of those sorts of things.\n\nThis game and its soundtrack are completely worth the money.

The sword acts as the narrator of the story and as the majority of the player's insight into the world.\n\nRed uses the sword, the titular "Transistor", to fight off mysterious white invaders known as "The Process". The sword begins with a few attacks and has the ability to stop time (called "turn) to plan attacks, and then execute the qued attacks. This can only be done once every few seconds, depending on how many actions were lined up, and this is the main method of playing. The player can attack outside of combat when they aren't regenerating their "turn" ability or when an ability is upgraded with a specific augment, but it's very slow and inaccurate. There's a multitude of skills (called "functions"- 18 in total) which can also be used to augment other skills or Red herself. Functions are multi-purpose: not only do they act as Red's skills system, but they also unlock fragments of backstory for the game while using them in one of the three different capacities (ability, ability upgrade, personal upgrade), but the backstories are focused on the person related to the ability.\n\nThe skill system is very interesting and can lead to some creative builds, but ultimately the goal is still to do gross amounts of damage, and there's only a handful of skills that will help you reach those levels. While many of these functions have interesting properties and uses, Transistor's combat doesn't really lend to using some of them more than once to unlock background story. An example of this is the function "Get", which pulls an enemy toward you. Due to the nature of combat, Get often is redundant or, at worst, a detriment. When executing a turn, time isn't stopped anymore- it's slowed. Faster creatures will begin to move away from your planned abilities and Get can sometimes miss or pull the wrong one. This doesn't require faster enemies to mess up, either, as the game's readout of potential damage often is misleading. When stacking attacks, the game will caculate how much damage will occur to enemies. Often it'll drop out enemies if there's too much information on the screen, but it also poorly handles damage over time and momentum knocking enemies out of range. Some monsters, like Jerk 3.0's, are able to rotate so quickly that by the time you're done buffing and debuffing, they have rotated and you can no longer backstab. This is frustrating considering that the two most simple solutions are: A, stop time entirely for the turn function, or B, remove the damage readout.\n\nDespite being flawed on many fronts on its own, the mediocre combat isn't the only thing to blame. Enemies in Transistor focus on ten different enemies. These enemies start out basic, and get "upgrades" as the player continues through the story. These upgrades are denoted by a 2.0 or higher designation beside the name. Despite the intent that the player needs to deal with these enemies in different ways, none of these enemies force the player to think differently. The answer is always the same: use a turn and do as much damage as possible in one go, preferably by way of AoE damage. This is absolutely true for every enemy, from hulking Jerks to artillery Cluckers. There are some attempts to break this up, such as the Snapshot's obscuring effect, but many of the abilities in the game already force the player into melee combat, so they are often inconsequential. In the later stages of the game, the player merely need to wait until an enemy is no longer stealthed to unleash flurry of void debuffs and a final cull swing.\n\nThe game is rather short, and it takes somewhere in between two to six hours for a playthrough, depending on if the player does everything (interacting with spots and terminals, doing challenges, etc) or not. The player is thrust into the story as soon as they start the game for the first time, and it really never becomes much clearer. Transistor takes something of a "Dark Souls" approach to telling a story by having it dispersed through strings of text on functions and difficulty increasing "limiters". The Transistor, whom is inhabited by someone Red knows that remains nameless, is the main source of off-hand information during the game, usually to excess. The problem with this story is that nothing is ever divulged, nothing is ever expanded upon, and most information presented through functions are about people that either aren't important to the story or provide nothing concurrent that puts things into context. The game is absolutely full of plot holes to an incredible degree and it's presented in a way that would be lost on a lot of people, as it expects the player to use all abilities in all capacities and sift through the text. It's terrible storytelling, which is a shame. The story is interesting, but inaccessible unless subtitles (for Sybil, Royce and Mr. Nobody) and with some extra reading and conjecture. Conjecture is not a basis for storytelling, though; you're just witnessing an event without any context. It's like if you've witnessed a UFO beaming up some farm animals in the distance. Without the rest of the story, the game focuses on Red and Mr. Nobody's extremely obvious relationship as lovers, and Mr. Nobody talks at great length in regards to this when he's not busy filling your ears full of nonsense otherwise. "Sea Monster's the only real choice here," indeed. The relationship stands somewhere around "puppy love" on the devotion spectrum until the end of the game, but there's really no development at all. There's no back story, outside of a few obscure references and some images during the credits.\n\nThe majority of the game is spent trying to get to the Camerata in their tower, and then backtracking through some of the early areas to an M.C. Escher area (which contrasts to the Gustav Klimt inspired "golds and shapes" artwork through the rest of the game). The areas, while beautiful, are exceptionally similar and the game's areas bleed into each other. While there's plenty of polish, there's plenty of little things I wouldn't expect at this level of polish, like how OVC terminals are pretty much just inverted when facing the other way, including the giant "OVC" markings. These things become very apparent when the environments aren't differentiated, and when you're doing the same things over and over.\n\nSupergiant Games had a lot to live up to for their second game, and I can't really hold them to those expectations; they were just astronomical considering Bastion was their first fare, which was both refreshing, innovative, and honed in just about every category. Something about Transistor feels rushed, or hollow. It's hard not to compare Transistor to Bastion with all the similarities and outright references to it; a silent protagonist with a narrator voiced by Logan Cunningham battles to save what's left of their city using a deus ex machina device, all whilst encountering a few survivors and an eventual "betrayal" that leads the character to seek greener pastures. The only differences here are story elements, which are even more vague in this offering, and the well meaning but ultimately poor combat. I'm pressed to say that this game would be amazing for a first entry as a studio, but, it's not.\n\nTransistor is an okay game plagued with self-plagiarizing of old concepts and poor execution of new ones.","May 25, 2014","true","10.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The whole atmosphere constructed by the art and soundtrack is very immersive. The whole story came together beautifully.\n\nGameplay:\n\nIt's an interesting take on giving players a choice between etiher real-time womanliness combat (which I'm not woman enough to do) or "halting time" so you can plan out a series of executions (use a skill, move, use a skill, use a skill, move, etc.), and even a mix of both.\n\nHave to admit though, the controls on the keyboard aren't too great, and while it isn't a huge issue, I am more inclinded to use the plan-it-out option in fights just to make sure I hit the right things.\n\nArt:\n\nWhat can I say? It's beautiful. It's breathtaking. It looks like it was a hell-of-lot of work to do, so kudos to the art team. It's really amazing.\n\nSoundtrack:\n\nFor me, the fantastic song "We All Become" featured in the reveal trailer stands out the most.

It doesn't (and couldn't) have the "amazing thing out of nowhere" quality of Bastion. But the art direction, narration, and setting of Transistor are more to my taste.\n\nThe story has a cryptic in medias res presentation and requires a lot of digging to uncover and properly arrange what is actually going on, but that was OK with me.\n\nI also was happy trying out tons of different loadouts and combinations of the combat powers -- the motivation of unlocking story/background bits, and tackling the different challenge rooms, was enough to push me into that experimental approach. And I think that made for a more enjoyable playthrough. Transistor strikes me as being a little analogous to Bioshock in that way; it's tempting to just wrench and electrobolt your way through Bioshock, and you couldn't really be blamed for doing that, but you might have had more fun intentionally trying other weapons/plasmids.\n\nTransistor definitely is flawed as a combat-heavy game with nuanced but poorly tutorialized mechanics that are also hard to visually "read", so I imagine many people will bounce off of it. For various reasons I stuck with it though and ended up having a very good time. I even fired up NG+ immediately and played about halfway through it again. It's a beautiful game that attempts some interesting things, and I'm glad I played it.","January 19, 2015","true","10.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jesskitten/recommended/237930/","jesskitten","Shiara","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jesskitten/","1888 products in account","Oh I really enjoyed Transistor. I finished the regular and NG+ playthroughs of the game across a span of about 3-4 days. One could probably rush through the story in as little as 3 hours, or take time unlocking all the lore, doing the side challenges for extra xp and game knowledge, listening to the catchy music, and stopping to smell all the roses along the way and end up taking easily triple or quadruple that.\n\nThe game and combat mechanics are pretty fun, with a number of subroutines that you unlock or add to your Transistor weapon as you level up. You form actual skills with those subroutines, using a combination of active slots, support slots (that you slot subroutines into to improve active slots), and four passive slots (buffs to improve your character as a whole). Each subroutine does a different, but thematically similar, thing depending on whether it's currently in an active, passive, or support slot.\n\nThere are thus many different possible and valid skill combinations and loadouts, and I found myself constantly swapping back and forth between them as I went through the game, especially once I started doing the side challenges where constraints force you to experiment and find new and efficient (or slow and steady) ways of killing things. In addition, each subroutine represents a character within the game's lore and to unlock the full lore for a character, if so desired, requires you to use their subroutine in each of the three slot types for at least one battle, each slot type unlocking about 1/3 of their character bio.\n\nCombat itself is a combination of real time and planning mode, and is split up largely into a number of self-contained encounters. Planning mode pauses the map and allows you to preview, queue, and execute in quick succession a number of attacks at once in an interface similar to Xcom or Shadowrun Returns, except that you can preview and rewind options before finally committing. There is no miss chance, or random skill damage, damage is constant but modified by variables depending on if the enemy is stunned or backstabbed, for example.\n\nCarrying out actions in the planning mode enables them all to be done in less than a game time second, so it become a power play of sorts whenever planning mode is up, but each ability used in planning mode has a cost which is subtracted from the remaining amount of action points you have in that round of planning. Once you leave planning mode, however, you cannot use most skills until the cooldown for the next planning round is up, leaving you with a few seconds of vulnerability between planning rounds. However, skills used during real time do not trigger a cooldown, and so in some cases it is very beneficial to fight things in real time (or a combination of the two) instead of always in planning mode.\n\nAn interesting mechanic that I did not figure out until I was into NG+, was that while you have a certain number of action points to spend per round, not actually spending them all allows your downtime before you next skill use to be proportionally smaller, which is critical versus a certain enemy in the game. On the flip side, spending "over" what you normally have in planning mode locks your skills for that much longer before you can use them again!\n\nThe story in the game was pretty neat, if a little on the short side, with a narration style similar to Bastion, but this time the narrator is also the Transistor and with you from the start. Like Bastion, you are dumped right into the plot to start off, and the story is revealed in pieces as you go along. The narration is touching in places, boring in others, but overall quite well done. That ending though. It came unexpected to me the first time, as I didn't think that was the end of the game yet, but hit harder the second time through for me when I knew what was coming. I didn't want to end the game. I did love the ambience though! A combination of the music and the dystopian steampunk background scenery. I am a sucker for night-time big city skylines, and the art in this game evoked so many wistful memories.\n\nA couple cons of the game: It's very easy to miss certain lore terminals and the game often doesn't let you back up if you went a little too far in one direction. It is often not obvious which way is "onward" and which way is a dead end with a lore piece. Your only options then are to load back from the last save (and you can only save at certain locations, though there is pretty much one before or after nearly every fight) or wait until NG+ to see what you missed. Or YouTube. The narrator is also overly talkative at times, though I guess that's a personality trait. There are also several plot holes in the story to me still, like *why* the Transistor's ownership got passed over to Red, and several other things I feel are little plot holes here and there that are not adequately explained.","January 20","true","27.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Every moment of playing Transistor I was wondering where it would take me next, and I was never disappointed by what followed my anticipation. It has a very intereting take on a futuristic politics landscape, and has very well-thought out characters and developement.\n\nThe combat is fluid and tactical, while somehow having an elegance about it. It utilizes such simple mechanics, however that does't mean it won't push your understanding of these mechanics to the limit as the difficulty definitely does ramp up as the game proceeds. The game will follow exactly what you want, and it is all up to your skill and cunning to successfully defeat all foes that come your way. The game mixes many genres but with flawless results as you level up and collect new abilities and powers a la an RPG, while you switch into turn-based strategy, and then into a fast-paced action game. The game keeps you on your toes and always tries to throw something new at you, but never going overboard and bringing you a challenge that is impassible.\n\nHowever the show-stopping point of this game, as similar to other Supergiant success, Bastion, is the art direction. The voice over by Logan Cunningham, and the tunes sung by Ashley Lynn Barrett seal the deal of the package as they drive home the emotion, setting, and character of the game without eveer seeming forced or clunky. The look of Transistor is sleek and futuristic and as you delve deeper into the story the surroundings transition perfectly. Near the conclusion of the game you return to where you had started but the setting has changed drastically,  and the score has been remixed. This point really displayed the kind of talent the creators have, and how powerful an indie developer can be.\n\nTransistor is a marvel to look at, a blast to play, and has a story dripping in charm and intrigue. If you were a fan of Bastion, it will not disappoint you, and I highly reccomend it.","January 1","true","9.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's a beautiful game with a great soundtrack and wonderful voice acting. The vast array of combat options that open up as you progress allow for a staggering degree of customization. Unfortunately, it is also held back by several areas of weakness. The story, while featuring some interesting characters and an imaginative setting, ultimately felt small, like something that could have been condensed into just a short story or short film. The visually vibrant world you travel through feels somehow empty, devoid of life aside from the enemies you encounter. Finally, the combat never quite develops a pleasing sense of flow to it.\n\nSupergiant Games has again raised the bar on weaving a soundtrack into a game. This time it feels even more personal to the story since the main character, Red, is the singer. Just know before you choose to buy the soundtrack that only a handful of the songs have vocals, not counting the extended soundtrack which features a lot of Red humming. Numerous of the purely instrumental tracks have found their way into my music library, but they're not the main attraction.\n\nSimilarly top notch is the voice acting. Fans of Bastion will recognize the way that it is utilized. It adds atmosphere and brings these characters to life. I must, however, disagree with the decision to have Red's voice "taken away" right at the start of the game. She is a fully fleshed out character, not some blank slate for players to project themselves into. Yet some of that is lost by not letting her speak. It also reduces other characters in the game to mostly talking at you in monologues where there could have been conversations. I get why it was an appealing option for the developers though. It's interesting to consider how a singer would feel and react to having one of her most valuable faculties taken away. The world surely feels more bleak and lonely this way too. You even get to hear her through the songs and occasionally in written form. However, as it is I would say more was lost than gained by muting her.\n\nWhile avoiding spoilers, I will say that I would have liked to have seen more out of the story. A lot of the right ingredients were there, but for the most part I would say the quantity wasn't enough or things were left too vague. I liked the characters that were there, but it could have used a couple more of them, particularly ones not affiliated with The Camerata (you're introduced to them early on). I was intrigued by the city of Cloudbank, was TOLD about some of its neat features and people, but I never SAW them. The game never fully convinced me that the place you spend most of your time in was ever lived in by everyday people. This may be a futuristic city where things like trash don't exist, but there has to have been more evidence of life left behind that could have been put into the visuals.\n\nFinally, it seems that Transistor's most divisive aspect is its combat system. I was definitely in the camp disappointed with it at first but it does get better as you unlock more options. You have several primary "Active" attack slots that can each be significantly altered by two secondary upgrade slots. You also have passive buff slots. Every ability, or Function as the game calls them, can only be used once until you are in New Game+ and begin getting multiples. You have to decide how you want to utilize each function: Active, Upgrade or Passive? You rarely are able to use all your functions at once.\n\nIt is in the action of battle that things start to falter. The Active functions you bring into the fight and a unique ability to briefly stop time are the only tools ever at your disposal. There is no blocking or dodging aside from normal movement. In stopping time, you have an action bar that is depleted with each action you take. Once you unpause, all the actions you just planned play out at super speed. Obviously this is extremely powerful and it is counterbalanced by disabling all actions besides movement for a time based on how much of the action bar you depleted.\n\nThe problem is that it is unsatisfying to use. It doesn't take skill to stop time and wail on an unmoving target and it's not fun to run around waiting on a timer afterward. If you forgo this superpower then you're left with, at most, four Active functions to use, and that usually breaks down to spamming one or two of them. If the game had any form of defensive maneuver, I think the developers knew you'd be far less likely to use the time stop. Yet that is the gimmick they went with. The most joy I found in combat was in frequently trying out new builds, including ones others suggested online.\n\nTransistor teeters on the edge of whether I'd recommend it or not, but ultimately a couple of its strengths are SO strong that it belongs in the thumbs up category. I will add that if you haven't played Bastion, that is the better game to start with and to get a feel for if you enjoy how Supergiant Games crafts their products.","March 2","true","14.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","1"

I was first introduced to it by a show (that might be canceled) Called Reviews on The Run where they reviewed Video Games and Movies. A near perfect is what they gave it.\n\nA year or so after Bastion was now coming to Steam. I bought it and I loved it. I loved it more than any game I had ever played before. It was amazing.\n\nI'm glad to say that I feel the same about this game except I feel NOTHING SuperGiant makes will ever Compare to Bastion.\n\nPeople are saying that it's a mix of Action and Stratagy and it came be either one if you want it to. I disagree. You have a function called Turn() Using this lets you plan out attacks ahead of time causing a stategic plan to be made. If you run in not using your Turn() like some psychopathic manic then yes, you will die. You can't just fight. You must plan.\n\nThe Soundtrack is just amazing. It takes classic Jazzy music and mixes in some more electric bounce music. That's pretty much all I have to say about the Soundtrack.\n\nWhen originally seeing the art style in the first trailer from Pax Prime 2013 (I think...) I fell in love with it. When I got into actual gameplay I wasn't a huge fan at first. Now this is me being all picky just because I didn't like Red's face.

This game has it all - Outstanding story, amazing music, breathtaking artwork, and great gameplay to go along with it. In particular the fact that you could control the difficulty as the game went on with limiters made the game insanely fun, and the story that you could really only fully understand by taking your time to read the OVC terminals and function archives made it that much more interesting. I would recommend this game in an instant to anyone who was looking for nice, laid back singleplayer adventure. 10/10, 4 stars, 2 thumbs up.

After so many hours staring at my game library, I couldn't believe that a game could offer me the satisfaction I was looking for.\n\nI thought this was an entirely tactics-based game - I was wong. This is an action packed game with a strategic function akin to fallout 3. The art style and level setup in this game is truly masterful.\n\nThe combo system for "functions" is amazing. I love being able to combine my "Switch()" move with my "Load()" move. Each move (as an upgrade, passive, or active skill) has its own charm. The combinations are fun to explore and really add to the overall experience.\n\n"Limitors" are a way to make the game harder (and more fun). By adding "limitors" you add to the enemy difficulty and experience bonus after each battle. It's really rewarding and fun.\n\nI don't know why I didn't play this game early.\nIt's really a great game with a driving plotline and replayability.","April 27","true","10.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Graphics, gameplay, controls are very good.  I would rate the game 9/10 because its kinda short, 4-5 hours but if you play the extra challenges and go for a second run then it will be more hours, no duhhh.\n\nLike the idea of mixing your power up perks, not really a based turn game in a way.  You got limited mobility (dont get me wrong you can still move, but when planning your attack you have limited time) which you should take advantage and plan your attack, you cant spam your power ups.  Each power up has different abilities, it can serve straight up as a power up or serve as an attachment or as a passive perk.  Mixing your power ups is part of the fun, you can become badass if you used them well.

The combination real-time/turn-based combat allows for deep strategy and will keep you switching up your selected functions (and the functions that modify them) to find a play style that suits you best.\n\nIt is sadly quite linear: all battle encounters are static locations (though the enemies can change based on your level) and there are only one or two very small optional areas. And, unless you missed a few corners of interaction or side rooms with static art (like the opening image,) the only reason to play again is for the sake of achievements; there's not even minor alternate endings like Bastion. (And, when you see the ending, you'll probably wish there was.)\n\nThat said, the positives of combat, music, and story vastly outweight the negatives of linearity and low-replay value, and I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a short, strategic brawler or just more of what they loved from Bastion. The soundtrack itself is excellent all its own, so even if you don't go for the game you should pick up the soundtrack.","August 9, 2014","true","28.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Wait a few seconds for your powers to recharge and then you can go again.\n\nBut that is just the half of it. Each "power" has three different uses. A main use, a backup use and a passive use. So depending on where (or how) you choose to use each power (or combine it with others) you can get a huge of array of attacks, each different from the last.

I didn't get into Bastion, somehow, though from what I've heard it was also a great game. But Transistor I know is great. My playtime is a bit low since I mostly played the game on PS4, and there I'm halfway NG+.\n\nThe combat system is extremely interesting and original. One thing is the timestopping feature (or something more like "planning phase", to be exact) combined with how the damage works. But the really amazing part is how there are multiple clever combinations of abilities and skills, and even modifiers to make the enemies stronger. It'll take a whole playthrough to just find out all of them, and figuring out how they work together, and with the difficulty scaling up just fine, you're bound to have a good time. While I could praise the combat system forever, that wouldn't make a very interesting review. So just know that it's awesome. The only bad thing really was that there were just a few skill combinations that made the game feel a bit too easy. But that kind of thing exists almost everywhere, really, and it definitely wasn't enough to make the system feel flawed at all.\n\nThe voice acting was nice (and while this has nothing to do with the Steam version, it was just SO COOL to hear the Transistor's voice from your controller... It was like you were really carrying the thing!), as was the atmosphere — the feeling of being alone was only emphasized by the fact the only voice you ever heard was, well, a sword. The storytelling was interesting, too; facts being revealed in a nice, slow pace to keep things shrouded in a mystery, to be revealed slowly, bit by bit, through various means.\n\nThat's what I have to say for now.

Beautiful art style, fun combat and gameplay, and boasts strong replay value (a rarity for me).  Instead of the weapon choices of Bastion, you have four separate slots in which you can make different and unique combinations of three different programs each, in addition to four passive slots.  The variety will keep you playing without a doubt. "Dying" removes one of your slots and the program within it until you reach a checkpoint, which forces you to experiment with new combinations if you aren't careful. Soundtrack is breathtaking and truly draws you into the game with the "hummed" overlay when you go into VATS / planning mode.

This game is as beautiful, if not even more beautiful than Bastion. However, before I go on with the rest of my review, I should say that even if you loved Bastion, you may not love this game. A lot of people fell in love with Bastion, not just because of the gameplay and music, but because of the storyline and the narrator that made you feel like you were part of the story.\n\nNow, that's not to say that Transistor doesn't have an interesting storyline, it's just that the storyline isn't as clear as it was in Bastion. That's not necessarily a bad thing either, some people like these sort of stories, I'm one of them. Transistor's story is a little more open to interpretation, whereas Bastion's was straightforward, so in this regard, some Bastion lovers may be disappointed. It's also a little hard to understand the story, even after two playthroughs, I mean, I get what's going on, but I'm left with a why at the end of the game. It's explained why in the game, but the reason just seems a bit flawed, I can't talk much more about it without spoiling things, so I'll leave it at that.\n\nAs for the narrator, Logan Cunningham, I'm really glad to see that he's back in this game. The only issue I had, was that his impact on the game felt like it fell short in comparison to Bastion. The reasoning behind that, is because in Bastion, he actually played a bit more of an important role, in Transistor, however, he just seems like a big question mark the entire time. Now, while he is considered a main character, I mean, he's with you the entire time after all, it's just that they never really give much information on him.

Bastion was really clear cut with it's story, and that's fine, but I love the way Transistor is a lot more open with it's own story. It takes awhile to figure all of out, but I find it to be more interesting that way.\n\nThe soundtrack of this game is just amazing. I don't know how Supergiant Games did it again, I usually don't keep in-game music/sounds on, unless if they're really good, and I kept mine on the entire time while playing Transistor. I'm even listening to it now while writing this review, I'll probably end up buying the soundtrack on Steam later on. The music just matches so perfectly with the game itself, it doesn't feel like a distraction, it only enhances the experience.\n\nThe gameplay of Transistor is a bit more interesting than Bastion as well. Though I should warn you to look up some videos on youtube of the gameplay before buying Transistor. Personally though, I love the mix of using the turn-based system, along with just attacking without the turn system. It's a pretty interesting way to play, a good mix of both is the best way to go, in my opinion. The ability to use your functions (skills) as actives, passives or upgrades is a pretty cool concept as well. A bit limiting in some cases, but that just adds a bit more to the challenge.\n\nIn terms of achievements, this is rather easy to perfect in comparison to Bastion and perhaps most games in general. There isn't much difficulty involved in many of the achievements, they're more time consuming than anything. However, since the game is rather short, it only takes like 6-7 hours for your first playthrough and then perhaps 4-5 more for your second playthrough. I finished both of my playthroughs in a little over 11 hours and got all of the achievements, so it's definitely a bit shorter than Bastion.\n\nTo conclude, Transistor is a beautiful and wonderful game on it's own. If you think it'll be exactly the same as Bastion however, you may be a bit disappointed. However, Transistor is my favorite game so far this year, it did not disappoint me one bit and it only surpassed the expectations I had. I am merely warning those who think this is almost an exact copy of Bastion, it is not.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Interesting gameplay\n+ Beautiful art style\n+ Wonderful music\n+ Decent replay value\n+ Lots of different combinations for functions (skills)\n\nCons:\n\n- A bit on the short side (6 Hours for first playthrough)\n- Some parts of the story could use a bit more explaining","July 2, 2014","true","11.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This game is as beautiful, if not even more beautiful than Bastion. However, before I go on with the rest of my review, I should say that even if you loved Bastion, you may not love this game. A lot of people fell in love with Bastion, not just because of the gameplay and music, but because of the storyline and the narrator that made you feel like you were part of the story.\n\nNow, that's not to say that Transistor doesn't have an interesting storyline, it's just that the storyline isn't as clear as it was in Bastion. That's not necessarily a bad thing either, some people like these sort of stories, I'm one of them. Transistor's story is a little more open to interpretation, whereas Bastion's was straightforward, so in this regard, some Bastion lovers may be disappointed. It's also a little hard to understand the story, even after two playthroughs, I mean, I get what's going on, but I'm left with a why at the end of the game. It's explained why in the game, but the reason just seems a bit flawed, I can't talk much more about it without spoiling things, so I'll leave it at that.\n\nAs for the narrator, Logan Cunningham, I'm really glad to see that he's back in this game. The only issue I had, was that his impact on the game felt like it fell short in comparison to Bastion.

Once again the game starts in a city where some kind of catastrophic event took place and the hero must fight it and maybe find a way to undo it. You'll recognize the art style and the familiar voice of Logan Cunningham guiding you through the game, this time not as the narrator but as a companion.\n\nEven with all the similarities, Transistor ia a very different experience. The setting is much more futuristic. Everything in the game is related to programming language and sometimes you wonder if the city of Cloudbank is a real city or just some kind of complex metaphor. The battle system has a unique mix of action and strategy. Every skill (called function in the game universe) can be placed in an active or passive slot. Besides that, every skill can upgrade another skill, or even itself, leading to a huge amount of possibilities to choose from.\n\nThe only negative aspect of the game is that it'll take about half the time to finish it if compared to Bastion. There is a Recursion Mode that works like a NG+ where you can start the game again retaining the level and skills from the previous run but that's it. Besides that minor flaw, Transistor is still a masterpiece.","July 31, 2014","true","17.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dracosummoner/recommended/237930/","dracosummoner","dracosummoner","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dracosummoner/","180 products in account","Short version: This art-house action-RPG comes with an unconventional/semi-turn based battle system, gorgeous music and visuals, a somewhat thin but wonderfully told narrative, and remarkable integration of gameplay and storytelling.  It's a gem of a game with a decent amount of content and is absolutely worth cherishing.\n\n--------\n\nLong version: Transistor begins gently and without a lot of explanation, giving the player just enough information to know what's going on and where to go.  In short, you're on the run from your would-be assassins, fighting enemies along the way.  You have a sword that talks (voiced by Logan Cunningham, the narrator from Supergiant Games' own Bastion), and the game doesn't bog you down with needless explanations of how a lot of the setting's pieces work.  You quickly acquire abilities as you go, and these skills make Transistor special in several ways:\n\n1) Battles in Transistor work somewhat like Diablo's where you can button-mash if you want, but you can also queue up and instantly execute a limited number of attack commands or move a certain distance without enemy reprisal.  The catch is that until your Turn() meter refills over a few seconds, you can't use most of your attacks, so you have to be careful to play conservatively.  At the same time, you'll eventually become strong enough to where you can and should try to stay in real time more often, which works out well since your time-stop ability can leave YOU vulnerable if you're not careful.\n\nYou can only equip a few of your skills as hotkey actives at once, and dying restores your health but disables one of your remaining skills until either you have none left, or you win the battle and make a certain amount of forward progress in the game.  This arguably leaves you even worse off than if you'd simply been forced to restart the fight, which you can also choose to do from the pause menu.  (Note that a few areas place you in big battles right after long interactive cutscenes without giving you a save point first; since battles can sometimes be immediately repeated, try not to hit "Retry" on impulse if circumstances turn against you.)  Enemies usually don't have a lot of defensive immunities, though, which is great about keeping you from feeling penalized for using a certain play style.  They're also smart enough to be aware of one another and to know how to protect and even heal each other.\n\nMore importantly, skills never feel redundant, and they're designed to play off of each other, not to exist in isolation or to be used at random.  Your abilities have their own slots where they can plug into one another and change each other's properties.  One skill fires long-ranged arrows when put on a hotkey, but it can also be plugged into other skills, which usually increases their range.  You can later do the same thing with your own character, which grants additional benefits like a deflector shield or a health recharge--one of the few you'll get, so don't take it for granted.\n\nThere are no character classes in Transistor, but the wonderful skill system allows you to customize and change up your play style throughout the game.  If you want to play a stealthy assassin, a somewhat tanky gunner, or a manipulator who turns enemies against each other, you have quite a few options to choose from.  The variety of different animations and graphical effects for the huge number of potential skill combinations is simply stunning--these aren't just throwaway stat boosts here--and it makes your abilities feel almost like they physically affect one another rather than simply doing whatever the game tells them to do.  I might have overlooked a way to do this, but it would be nice to be able to simply click an upgrade slot and see my various effect options at a glance, instead of just clicking on a skill itself and seeing the various places it could go.  In other words, "I know what ability I want to augment, but not specifically how I want to do so."\n\n2) This is one of my favorite parts.  Skills are connected to different characters and their individual stories, and while I sometimes don't like when a game presents a lot of its story through text, this method is genius--your abilities' text logs are divided up into parts that must be uncovered by equipping your skills in different ways.  Use one ability in its active mode to get one piece of text, then use that ability to upgrade another and get the next piece of text, and so on.  Hence, the game rewards and demands experimentation if you want to read all of the background info.  You can't get too comfortable with a certain battle strategy you like, since you have to constantly rearrange your skills and try new things with them in order to get the most out of the story, let alone the battles and their fairly sharp challenge curve.  It feels a lot more involving than simply having info dumps thrown at you because you discovered an unfamiliar character or area.\n\nSpeaking of difficulty, you can customize it to some extent by turning on various options you earn called Limiters, which increase your rate of experience gain but also help your enemies out in some way.  Have fun turning them all on at once, achievement-lovers!\n\nWhen you're not battling, you navigate the deserted but absolutely beautiful streets and alleys of the city of Cloudbank, and I can't tell you how refreshing it is to play an adventure that takes you by multicolored, modern-looking restaurants, residential areas, and concert halls as opposed to yet another fantasy forest/desert/cave.  The city feels lived-in and familiar while still maintaining its own distinctive touches, such as weather and sky color being up to a popular vote, which you can take part in.  You'll be taking gorgeous, probably wallpaper-quality screenshots almost constantly--I have almost as many screenshots saved from 20 hours of Transistor as I do from 150 hours of Dota 2.  Even in the few cases where the game's tendency to not always explain itself makes for some genuinely weird encounters, the journey never stops being compelling and never overstays its welcome.\n\nThe main story isn't that long, and while you'll fly through it on New Game Plus (especially if you turn off all the limiters after finishing the character-level achievements like I did), the various "challenge room"-style quests will keep you up at night.  My favorites were the planning tests, where you're given a specific loadout and tasked with clearing an area in one turn, which implicitly teaches you new strategy ideas and lets you play around with skills you don't always have immediate access to.  Woe be to those who forget to take notes.\n\nThe soundtrack, which Supergiant was wonderful enough to post on YouTube -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zA1jRmAYfU -- is for the most part spectacular, even though some of the more intense songs sound better while in the context of the game, like when you're busy running from something dangerous.  Ashley Barrett's vocals are indescribably wonderful, and the game even gives you a dedicated button for humming along to the background music, which gets put to genuinely awesome use at times.\n\n------\n\nTransistor, despite perhaps having room for more detail in the main plot, crams more visual and musical identity into its small but thoroughly memorable scale than I can recall from a lot of much bigger games, and even without the wonderfully fun Turn() system, the skill combinations and the wonderful production values make the combat more special than any number of hotkey bars ever will.  As of this writing, the game is currently on sale for $7, but I'd say it's easily worth its $20 asking price if you don't mind a product that exchanges length for sheer specialness.

It has a futuristic setting which brings forth many innovative and cool design concepts. Pity the story is abit too short. Overlooking that, the storyline is great. It has a touching ending, one that hits harder than bioshock infinite's ending. It brings forth questions that we must ask ourselves - Do we have to rely on technology? And to what extend? What is the worth of life, and the consequences that follow in the name of fame? How far do we go for our loved ones?\nOther than the story, the gameplay is absolutely fantastic. It allows you to customize your spells in all sorts of manner, promoting creativity and encourages people to keep grinding against the same enemies with different approaches. It also buffs the enemies as you progress further into the game, making it much more of a challenge then just a simple hack-and-slash game.\nWhat I like most about the game is definitely the artstyle and music. It fits in perfectly, reflecting on both the initial utopiantheme and the slow descent into the dystopia which the city becomes as one approaches the end. The option to hold tab and listen to Red sing is also a gem. Her voice protrudes out from the ambient yet invigorating background music, giving even more depth to the storyline of the game, singling it out from the conventional hack-and-slash genre type of games.\nOverall, it is a beautifully crafted and ingeniusly designed game. Would rate almost 10/10.\n\nGameplay: 9/10 (It's unique style style such as the "Turn()" ability makes it stand out from other hack-and-slash games. The enemy units are also properly balanced, posing as a proper challenge."\n\nVisuals: 10/10 (Absolutely stunning. Art is meticulous at the proper parts and simple yet creative at other spots. The design for the enemy units<younglady, jerk, badcell etc.> as well as the transistor is refreshing new and creative.)\n\nConcep/Storylinet: 9/10 (Very cool concept. Reveals alot about the human nature and it's instinct to be selfish. Deeper thoughts can be put into the storyline to reveal much much more about the settings and the story.)\n\nMusic: 10/10 (Beautiful. Fits into the settings perfectly.

The aesthetics are scintillating, the backgrounds and world are meticulously detailed. The characters and enemies are well animated and designed, mirroring the world around them. There's a very strong noir vibe seeping through what often feels like cyberpunk New York as imagined by Europe. There's every chance I'm just projecting my desire for Remember Me to have been a good game, but I digress.\n\nThe gameplay is solid, provided you realise that operating outside of Turn() is very rarely the best option. Transistor gives you a lot of different skills and variety of ways to combine them allowing you to play however you want, additionally the game encourages you to mix up your skills so that you can unlock character information and the "Performance Tests" force you to improvise with randomly selected skills. Unfortunately towards the end of the game encounters become quite repetitive and even with enemies evolving it is rare that whatever combo you've perfected by that point won't be just as effective as before. New Game+ is genuinely challenging but by then you are even furthered hampered in choices and will be extremely reliant on a few exceptional skills to get you through the encounters, especially with limiters on.\n\nIt is unfortunate to say that the story and characters feel like the weakest aspect of Transistor. You're dropped into the world with no knowledge of anything, and as you progress you slowly uncovers scraps of information by way of skills and terminals. The game is quite short too, and ultimately it can be quite difficult to become truly invested in either the world or characters. After talking with people and going through the NG+, there are a few nuances that are illuminated and can be appreciated but the story never takes that final step.\n\nTransistor is a good game. The worst thing you could say is that it is not Bastion. Regardless of who you are you should approach with caution and pay special attention to all the little details, from the art to the written and spoken dialogue.","May 29, 2014","true","10.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Gone are the days of waiting for the ground to load at the last second as you're walking toward it; it is now all preloaded when you enter the level.  Second, that the difficulty curve picks up where Bastion let off and ramps sharply upward from the get-go, offering a great deal of additional challenge, and requiring almost inhuman reflexes and quick-thinking strategy to survive even the earlier encounters.\n\nThere is, however, an unfortunate glitch where pressing [RT] causes the world textures to glitch out and the whole game to lock up.  I presume this is because it was the "special move" button in Bastion's engine, but this game doesn't have any special moves to assign to it.  This can be a frustrating experience when it happens in the heat of combat.  Hopefully this can be fixed in an update patch.\n\nIn the end, we are left with many new questions: What if Transistor could talk?  What if Transistor was a guy (a ”Tranbrothor," if you will)?  Perhaps these will be left open to interpretation, but maybe we will be lucky enough to see the developer round out the trilogy and tie up all the loose ends.\n\n★★★★★","January 1, 2015","true","8.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","70","7","10","8","0"

The amount of skills and the possible different combinations that you get are mind boggling, and most have very significant effects on the way you play the game. Combat can be done strategicaly with the Turn mode, or just plain old regular real time action, and are just equally as viable and fun!\n\nThough you are presented with a central plot, much of the lore is tied to the gameplay in an interesting manner and presented in a way that not only allows you the freedom of choosing how much of it you want to read/see/hear, but also adds to the sublime world Supergiant has created. The game has atmosphere, it has character, and it's a testament to how good Supergiant is at building a world, which in my opinion, is second to none.\n\nDespite how different this game is from Supergiant's previous game, Bastion, to compare both games is inevitable. Cloudbank is in most ways busier than the areas surrounding Caelondia, but its aethetics are darker and more muted. The music in Transistor is a bit more synthetic compared to the more instrumental nature of Bastion's music, but is no less wonderful. Gameplay wise, Transistor outperforms Bastion in every which way, offering more options and a more fleshed out combat system. Narrative wise though, it feels like Transistor falls short of Bastion by way of being just slightly less coherant and emotional. But, it is still really well done and stands on its own really well.\n\nMy only complaints about the game is how short it is, because I find myself just wanting MORE. While Recursion mode (New Game+) satisfies my desire for more gameplay, I also want more of the story, more of the music, and more of the world. Also, the game sometimes fails to explains the mechanics of its skills properly, leaving you to either figure some things out for yourself or consult a guide.\n\nShould you play this? Absolutely. Definitely do consider buying the soundtrack alongside the game, but do not hesitate to give the music a listen first by way of free streaming courtesy of Supergiant themselves. I only wish the soundtrack had the different variations of all/most of the songs, such as the BGMs with Red humming to them, or the instrumental versions of a few others.\nhttp://store.supergiantgames.com/products/transistor-original-soundtrack-digital\n\nUPDATE: Supergiant has released an extended version of the soundtrack with the aforementioned humming and instrumental verions.","May 23, 2014","true","9.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snowdusk/recommended/237930/","snowdusk","Snowdusk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snowdusk/","87 products in account","Transistor excels in so many ways, I don't even know where to start.\n\nIt essentially accomplished what a game means most to me: innovative gameplay mechanics, good storytelling, and state-of-the-art visuals, design, and music. But what makes Transistor stands out so much is that it demonstrated immense strength in all of the areas.\n\nGame Mechanics\nAt first, it seems like a generic hack-and-slash game (that is, you simply walk around and beat things up with your "skills"). That's not how half of Transistor works. Later it will reveal a new mechanic that allows you to literally pause the game and plan out your next actions. This is the true beauty of Transistor: you get the action-packed combat mixed together with a strategic problem-solving manoeuver, allowing you to experiment on how you can chain together different moves, and knowing which combo is best used for which situation.\n\nIn Transistor, you get to equip 4 "skills" at a time, known as Functions. Functions works in such a way that each function could be operated either as an Active slot, an Upgrade to enhance your Active Function, or a Passive slot that grants you certain perks in combat. Once you get a number of Functions, the possiblities of Function combinations are endless. This is where Transistor truly shines, and after finishing this game twice, I have probably yet to discover hundreds of other possible Function combinations to work on.\n\nThe Art\nSupergiant Games is renowned for its stunning visual art and unforgettable soundtracks, and Transistor is the best example you can get. All the background art you see in the game is hand-painted, and every music piece is woven seamlessly to the game. Besides, Supergiant Games made a really sweet move of creating the main character as a singer. Almost all the elements of the game revolved around her music — your character lost her voice and you're determined to get it back, you get to hear her humming to her own tunes, and you could unlock in-game soundtracks which you can play anytime. Basically, music is an integral part of Transistor, and Supergiant Games did an amazing job on this.\n\nTransistor's backstory may seem mediocre at first, but everything slowly unravels, and it all builds up until the last chapter (watching the end credits broke my heart into pieces). The story was presented in such a way that you have to head to different spots along the landscape and get a hint of what's going on. Even each Function actually originates from a character, so each Function has a story to tell. In order to fully appreciate the story, I suggest you inspect all the Functions and every nook and corner you find (or simply head over to the wiki, everything is there). There's also a sword that talks. Nothing is better than a talking weapon.\n\nConclusion\nI believe that Transistor is the hallmark of an innovative game produced by creative minds. It's not something you get to see very often in these few years, so I fully recommend it to anyone who loves games as a means of entertainment and artistic expression.\n\nTL;DR, Transistor excels in every aspect, innovative and refreshing game mechanics, great artistical value, and nothing beats a talking sword.","August 11, 2014","true","16.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/awkwardcow/recommended/237930/","awkwardcow","holy fuck i love crumpets","http://steamcommunity.com/id/awkwardcow/","208 products in account","WARNING: SLIGHT SPOILERS, SO IF YOU HAVE WEAK METABOLISMS, READ THE LAST PARAGRAPH!!!\n\nSupergiant Games have done it again. Transistor is a beautiful game that blends both gameplay and story so fluently that I forget that I am playing a game at times. The story begins with a mute singer who has just experienced her attempted murder, only to be saved by a bystander. The savior's voice and soul are transferred to the sword, which she carries around to find out what is happening to her city, and off you go.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me was the narrator's voice this time around makes more sense to actually hear, instead of Bastion's narrator, who you just sort of, could hear all the time for no real explanation. I know this really wasn't much of an issue in Bastion, but I like to see how the writers have grown up even more than Bastion's amazing story, which leads to another improvement: terminals. We've all been there trying to collect audio logs, but this time around, it's a bit different. Since Red has no voice, these terminals provide ways to communicate with the Transistor, which gives the player more motivation to go after them, rather than just skim over the story. Personally, I think this is a genius way to integrate both the present and the past stories of the game into one.\n\nWith such a great story, there has to be some glitches involved. My main problem is after the ending. And don't get me wrong, I LOVED the ending. I never thought how that would be the end, and it was a good conclusion to the arcing story between Red and her sword. But the problem is afterwards, the Recursion. In Bastion, there was a reason to play it over, as there were references to how you ended the game before, and as such have a different experience as before. But now, the game was ended with only one choice, so there really was no point to replay it, except for gameplay value. I guess the developers were going for a more linear story, which is perfectly fine, but I just expected a similar weave to the story as Bastion.\n\nNow, I mentioned gameplay before, and it is good. Not amazing, but good. It takes Bastion's hack-and-slash type and mixes a bit of turnbased action. When a Turn is activated, one can move freely across the field setting up attacks, using up your meter above to do so. Once you are done, you then watch your actions and hopefully dominate the field. The catch with using this system is that you must wait for the meter to fill up again before you may attack again, in Turn or out of. I find that is a good balance, but if you aren't able to dominate a powerful enemy in your Turn, then you are pretty much screwed. Luckily for me, I actually liked the Turn system, but if you don't, you may not have fun with the game, especially towards the end with Man enemies, and the final boss. Which brings up what happens when you die. When Red is defeated in a battle (hence the Turn meter is down and you lose all health), she loses a function that you have under the abilities bar, and you can't get it back until you reach two different function stations. This is an interesting aspect, but it can be quite annoying, as it is often random on what you lose. For example, I once lost my main attack function, and was left with my dodge and my load functions, which do nothing in battle without a good attack. I guess this is the point as it punishes you for losing rather than just spawning you to the last checkpoint, but in my eyes, it is ultimately just wasting my time as it adds not much towards my experience except annoyance.\n\nAnother issue is the extensive upgrade system. There were many combinations that one could make with their functions, but the problem was the GUI. You had to go through each function one at a time to see what upgrade you could add to a function. This could've been simply fixed by the ability to compare the upgrades with each function, rather than the other lengthy way. Not much of an issue, but it can be hectic near the ending when you have ten functions you have to go through at a time.\n\nLastly, the art style. Remember Bastion's art style? How alive the world felt? Well, magnify that by 10, and add some city elements towards the environment, and you got Transistor. The colors vibrate off the screen, and you wish that the city, maybe even the enemies, were existent. Really, there isn't much to say, but to just look at. I once just stopped playing and watched the background for a good minute. The artists know to not mess with a good formula, and luckily they didn't.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNO MORE SPOILERS AFTER, LAST PARAGRAPH/VERDICT\n\nTransistor truly adds more to the Bastion formula, but it still latches a bit too closely towards Bastion. However, this isn't a bad thing, as Supergiant Games are playing it safe and not making a completely different game, which is what we want. We want the same feel of atmosphere from Bastion, which we got with more interactions but less replayability. We want the same gameplay feel, which we got with more options but less hack-and-slash. And we want the same story and experience, which we got with more passion but less nonlinearity. So, do I recommend Transistor? If you liked Bastion and like a bit of change, you'll love this new addition. I sure did.","June 16, 2014","true","9.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The music, sound design, voice acting, and overall art direction are top notch, which is all the more impressive when you find out that a team of twelve built this game from the ground up. The painted world feels just as beautiful as Bastion's, even though you won't be visiting locations that are as varied.\n\nThe combat can be a little confusing at first do to the sheer number of ability combinations and the amount of planning that's involved, but you definitely get the hang of it with some experimentation. You will feel kind of limited initially since you won't have enough "memory" to equip and use all your abilities with passives and upgrades. As a result you will be sitting there with a lot of your ability, upgrade and passive slots empty, even at the end of the game. The difficulty feels like it scales quite nicely. As the game progresses enemies will upgrade in parallel with you, gaining new abilities as you gain tem yourself. And if you feel like the game is still too easy you can equip "limiters" (similar to the shrines in bastion) to make the enemies more difficult, which allows you to get a bonus to experience. I did wish there was an easier way to see some of your stats. You will have to do a bit of digging in order to find out what exactly what your health, damage, ability cost, and turn() values are.\n\nI clocked the game in at around 10 hours, though I spent a lot of time tinkering and trying to figure out the best combinations of abilities, upgrades and passives, and I did all the challenges you can unlock initially. I thought the story was a little weaker than bastions in that you have to do a lot more investigating to figure out exactly what's going on and the world doesn't feel as integrated with the gameplay. After beating the game I felt like I knew the broad strokes of  what was going on, but I felt like there are definitely some gaps to fill. Hopefully with new game+  I will uncover some new information. With all that being said, its still a great bittersweet tale to experience.\n\nTLDR: Great game, decent  story, good blend of action and strategy, and awesome art direction. 8.5/10","May 21, 2014","true","24.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Transistor is no dissapointment, this game is huge step up from Bastion, showcasing unique gameplay mechanics, with a fully customizable weapon at hand.\n\nThough this is one of the biggest feautres of the game, the story, soundtrack, design and love for the characters in the game got me through to the end. This game has such a deep story of lost love and the struggles to reunite with that one. Not only is the soundtrack well written and fitting with the game, it flows with the story development and events that occur through your playthrough, the stylised art is painstakingly detailed, and geometrically themed to maintain the futuristic feel in cloud bank.\n\nThough there were few flaws, some people may find the combat mechanic a bit repetitive, though that is merely encouragement to mix the Transistor's abilities around for a different approach during conflict.\n\nThe story is well written and heartfelt, while keeping soppiness out of the picture, beginning in the middle of initial conflict, which renders the protagonist unable to speak her mind and leaves the player to discover hidden details along the way, giving a satisfying and over all great ending. If I were to give this game a rating it would have to be 9/10 just because no game is perfect, but this cut so close, I love having a game the doesn't prolong important story development and yet still tells it powerfully, as well as the art and soundtrack winning me over, a truly moving game.\n9/10\n\n","August 29, 2014","true","7.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Transistor is no dissapointment, this game is huge step up from Bastion, showcasing unique gameplay mechanics, with a fully customizable weapon at hand.\n\nThough this is one of the biggest feautres of the game, the story, soundtrack, design and love for the characters in the game got me through to the end. This game has such a deep story of lost love and the struggles to reunite with that one. Not only is the soundtrack well written and fitting with the game, it flows with the story development and events that occur through your playthrough, the stylised art is painstakingly detailed, and geometrically themed to maintain the futuristic feel in cloud bank.\n\nThough there were few flaws, some people may find the combat mechanic a bit repetitive, though that is merely encouragement to mix the Transistor's abilities around for a different approach during conflict.\n\nThe story is well written and heartfelt, while keeping soppiness out of the picture, beginning in the middle of initial conflict, which renders the protagonist unable to speak her mind and leaves the player to discover hidden details along the way, giving a satisfying and over all great ending. If I were to give this game a rating it would have to be 9/10 just because no game is perfect, but this cut so close, I love having a game the doesn't prolong important story development and yet still tells it powerfully, as well as the art and soundtrack winning me over, a truly moving game.\n9/10\n\n","August 29, 2014","true","7.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

From the gorgeous style, to the genre choice, to the fantastic music, to the characters who initially just seem like ghosts of what they could be, yet slowly grow on you. The lines are well done, and everyone winds up having a personality of some kind that you begin to relate to them.\n\nThe combat is fresh, not something I've seen before (and I've been gaming a long time mind you), and they didn't slack there either. I played with a lot of limiters, but even without them, I can tell you that this one will take you a little while to get used to and will definitely test you. It's a strange blend of action, strategy, RPG, turn based combat, and even shooter all mixed together into a masterful blend that I initially dreaded, and by the end of the game (fantastic ending) was in love with.\n\nThis is the sort of game that was made with passion and dreams. This is the quality of game and the determination to make a fantasy that stands out amongst other dreams real for us gamers. I highly recommend this game, and I'm not entirely sure what audience I could think of that wouldn't find something appealing here. Talking swords, sci-fi, angry hardware trying to take over the world, over-eager scientists, lasers, giant explosions, godzilla-esque monsters, and VERY frustrating hairstyles... yeah, this game has a lot of nice quirks worked in all throughout.

An absolutely gorgeous hand-painted cityscape with a woozy yet full-bodied soundtrack makes it clear Supergiant knew what the first thing that came to player's minds were. Throw in another smoky voiced narrator voice to follow the antangonist through to the end of the journey, and it would seem Transitor is on to another winner.\n\nWell... it fails in a couple of fundemental ways. Yes, we can recall the lovely artstyle, music, *that* voice actor for Bastion, but part of the universal charm was the slick, smooth combat to follow up on a compelling storyline. The former is failed with Transistor, exchanging for a slightly more clunky affair, your character taking a moment to attempt most attacks, even needing to recover from the jaunt ability. The wide variety of upgrades, potions and weapon combinations are exchanged for a universal sword, the namesake of the game, with four primary abilities where you can assign your collected powers as either secondary additions, upgrading potency, number or secondary functions of your powers, and four passive slots. It seems that this could hold a lot of potential, but for the most part those combinations don't surprise or allow for in-depth theorycrafting. You just slap what you like to your abilities, make them more powerful/numerous/have an extra projectile thrown in and mash away. The "Turn()" system also does now allow for much depth, particularly end-game considering how enemies enjoy countering or simply dodging your best laid plans.\n\nThe story starts off incredibly promising. I was anticipating a very Film Noir experience thrown in to a heavy sci-fi (Read: Not cyberpunk) universe. Alas, it mostly repeats the same apocalyptic overtones of Bastion with an unsatisfactory and, frankly, confusing conclusion that leaves far, far more questions than answers and no clear antagonist to despise, the "Big Bad" showing up very late and with not much moustache twiddling to be had.\n\nThere are a few neat little touches that I enjoyed: The slick UI and artwork is just as gorgeous as the rendered graphics, you can see other players on their adventure via Dark Souls-esque ghosts around you, and there is even a button to hold to make the protagonist, Red, hum out a lovely counter-melody to whatever soundtrack is playing at the time. There is also, apparently, a procedurally generated post-game series of challenges to experience, but... the gameplay just didn't grab me enough to really care.\n\nI can't *not* recommend this game. The narrator, again, just about makes it, and the relationship between him and Red's conclusion enough was sweet enough. It *is* satisfying to watch said best laid plans work out just as you expect and watch a screen full of baddies die in one little turn, and the world, despite confusing and mysterious, is at least dazzling to explore. £15 though? Wait for a sale. Even taking my sweet time I easily steamrolled through this bite-sized treat in six hours.","June 6, 2014","true","6.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

With the same "narrator", the same music composer, the same isometric camera angle and the same hand-painted artstyle. But there's so much more to the game mechanics of Transistor than those of Bastion. Each Funtion has 3 options to it. You can slot it as an attack, a passive or slot in onto another attack. With around 20 Fuctions in the game, that's a lot of depth.\n\nI did have some worries about the length, with the main story only lasting 5 hours, but then I "recurred" through the story, which randomised the combat and then I completed all of the challenges which more than made up for it.\n\nTransistor is fantastic.

Especially since Supergiant also made Bastion, the undisputed best creative work mankind has ever produced.\n\nThe plot? I don't get the plot, which is amazing considering how much talking that damn memory-stick-for-a-sword does. At the onset, characters are introduced in quantity and events transpire rapidly... I promptly acquired an unrecoverable amount of plot knowledge debt. Storywise, Transistor quickly spreads out in width, but not in depth... not until my anticipation had degenerated into indifference. I perpetually felt one step behind whatever was happening.\n\nTransistor has a hybrid real-time/turn-based combat system (which makes up the bulk of the game) that isn't worth dwelling on. It's admirably done, and there's surely an audience for it, but I found it repetitive, predictable and boring.\n\nThe way that Red's skills are managed however... this is the good stuff. The real good stuff. Your combat abilities are called "functions". They sit in a great, big uncategorized pile. You can combine and use them however you see fit. Functions can be "installed" in 1 of 3 ways; as one of your 4 active abilities, as upgrades to those 4 abilities, or as passives. There are combinations that work very well, and combinations that work very poorly. Playing around with them is a treat. And you WILL play around with different function combinations whether you like it or not... because when your health runs out, rather than die, you lose the use of an active function. It stays disabled for long enough that you'll be compelled to replace it with something else in the meantime. It's a clever alternative to traditional gaming death that doesn't break flow, does invoke a penalty, AND promotes experimentation. Out of desperation, I was forced into using function combinations that I never would have otherwise... and oftentimes the effects were a pleasant surprise.\n\nI believe that other people will find virtue or indifference where I find fault.

The music, sound design, voice acting, and overall art direction are top notch, which is all the more impressive when you find out that a team of twelve built this game from the ground up. The painted world feels just as beautiful as Bastion's, even though you won't be visiting locations that are as varied.\n\nThe combat can be a little confusing at first do to the sheer number of ability combinations and the amount of planning that's involved, but you definitely get the hang of it with some experimentation. You will feel kind of limited initially since you won't have enough "memory" to equip and use all your abilities with passives and upgrades. As a result you will be sitting there with a lot of your ability, upgrade and passive slots empty, even at the end of the game. The difficulty feels like it scales quite nicely. As the game progresses enemies will upgrade in parallel with you, gaining new abilities as you gain tem yourself. And if you feel like the game is still too easy you can equip "limiters" (similar to the shrines in bastion) to make the enemies more difficult, which allows you to get a bonus to experience. I did wish there was an easier way to see some of your stats. You will have to do a bit of digging in order to find out what exactly what your health, damage, ability cost, and turn() values are.\n\nI clocked the game in at around 10 hours, though I spent a lot of time tinkering and trying to figure out the best combinations of abilities, upgrades and passives, and I did all the challenges you can unlock initially. I thought the story was a little weaker than bastions in that you have to do a lot more investigating to figure out exactly what's going on and the world doesn't feel as integrated with the gameplay. After beating the game I felt like I knew the broad strokes of  what was going on, but I felt like there are definitely some gaps to fill. Hopefully with new game+  I will uncover some new information. With all that being said, its still a great bittersweet tale to experience.\n\nTLDR: Great game, decent  story, good blend of action and strategy, and awesome art direction. 8.5/10","May 21, 2014","true","24.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Supergiant were criticised as a one-hit wonders with Bastion but they have come back with the artistic tour-de force that is Transistor. Through the wonderful handpainted art of Jen Zee and the beautiful tones of Darren Korb's soundtrack, you really get sucked into the abtract city that is Cloudbank and it's atmosphere.\n\nTransistor captures that fleeting moment of Red and The Transistor trying to make it through alive and to get to the bottom of everything. The pacing is on form, some people say its quite short (at 7 hours) but I feel its enough to tell the story that it needed to tell without overstaying its welcome. The world and characters gell so well and all feel completely new, helped by the wonderful narration and chemistry between the characters.\n\nTransistor isnt just all pretty picture, the ability system is quite different and completely customisable and promotes experimentation for completely different playstyles and the punishment for dying in game is one of the most original I've seen and actually adds to the experimentaion of the abilities.\n\nIn short, to me Transistor feels like a masterpiece of a painting with a wonderful story, good solid gameplay mechanics and a soundtrack ties it up into one fantastic and intelligently beautiful experience.\n\nTransistor is a game that will stick with me for years to come, and for that Supergiant, thank you.\n\n\n(I played this game completely offline so thats why my gametime in it is ~0 hours)","May 23, 2014","true","1.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Though once you do, it gets really enjoyable.\n\nWhile I haven't found the story to be executed in a way that'd make it exactly shine or keep my mind going on about it for days, I'd still say it was a great piece of art to play through. Where Transistor does shine, though, is the combat system mixing real-time action and turn-based planning into one. I couldn't get enough of the unique feeling of satisfaction coming from the massive piles of damage you get once you do things just right.\n\nBeing a game by Supergiant Games, Transistor fulfilled my expectations and both looks and sounds just beautiful. While in my personal top list of video game music Bastion still beats it, it's only by a very slight margin that probably wouldn't be visible to the human eye if that list of mine were to be shown graphically.

Perhaps that's because I don't find many games like Transistor.\n\nI recently found myself in the thralls of illness, and thus free from my daily responsibilites.  I decided to use this spare time to play the recently purchased Transistor.  In Transistor, the female protagonist (Red) is guided by an unknown familiar that is somehow trapped in the weapon that she wields: The Transistor.  You soon learn that they took her voice and she is driven, initially, by a sense of revenge and justice.  However, as the story unfolds, more questions arise as new entities are encountered and new perspectives are obtained.  Ultimately, many questions are left unanswered at the end of the story.  Even though you never truly know some of the details about Red's life before our story begins, and are left with a hazy understanding of the world that Red lives in, you gain absolute clarity of her character.\n\nFirst: Transistor was great to play.  Easy to pick up and learn, lots of options for upgrading and combining skills, and a nice medium for employing different strategies in fights.  The concept of essentially pausing battle in order to carry out attacks was very heavy early in the game, and it wasn't until later that I realized that it also played as an action/rpg style combat where using the transistor for planning was optional.  It proved to be beneficial to be proficient in both types of combat as I moved through the game. It was fun, challenging, and engaging to take the different challenges and encounter new enemies with abilities that I was already familiar with using against them.\n\nI found the story to be one of the best stories for any video game I have played.  It was compelling, it was beautiful, it filled me with sorrow and it filled me with joy.  It wasn't just the story that was compelling though; the way that they used Red's 'acquaintance' in the transistor to drive the story was a spectacularly subtle mechanism for keeping the player up to date with how Red might be moticated or directed by each event in the game.\n\nThe music didn't really stick out in this game for me.  To clarify: the music was great.  Many games really showcase the music, or to use the music to alert the player to a change in envoronment or mood.  In Transistor, the music fits seamlessly into the story, the gameplay, the entire experience of the game.  The music is a huge part of the game, helping to immerse the player into the "Transistor experience" by helping establish the setting rather than distracting from it in order to let you know that you're in a new place, or that danger is afoot!\n\nThe artwork? Beautiful.  Like the music, it seemed perfectly suited to this story to provide the most engaging, immersive experience.  It's easy enough to find the art for the game online or previews, so I won't say much more here.\n\nEverything about this game worked together to provide a wonderful, spectacular experience that I have been encouraging others to try since I've played it.  My love for video games has been rekindled, and I hope to see more games like this.\n\nHow is the replay value?  I'm going to find out!","June 10, 2014","true","8.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Everything about this game is art, from the music to the graphics to the story.\n\nTransistor is a sci-fi action adventure game with a combat system that's a mix of hack & slash and turn-based. You get about 20 "functions" which can each be used in three roles: firstly as a combat skill, secondly as an upgrade for skills, and thirdly as a passive that effects all skills and combat. You can install and uninstall these functions as much as you like, giving you lots of flexibility. As you level up you also get the choice to use limiters, which buff your enemies. These are optional, so you can challenge yourself however you see fit.\n\nThe only thing this game needs is more content. However, you can replay the game retaining all your skills and level from the previous playthrough, and there are special arenas that test your skill.\n\nDefinitely worth checking out.","May 23, 2014","true","13.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Don't let go.\n\nOverview\nTransistor is an isometric strategy adventure game starring Red, a voiceless entertainer and her anonymous lover, the latter trapped inside a sword-shaped tool known as the Transistor. Join Red and her mentor-turned-weapon through an epic adventure that explores the concept of singularity and discover the secrets of the city of Cloudbank and the mysterious Camerata family.\n\nStory\nTransistor manages to take some interesting ideas and delivers them in an interesting way. Though there are a few cutscenes, most of the story is disclosed through the brief (but frequent), private whispers of the Transistor. Red happily listens, creating an authentic, naturally-developing emotional foundation between Red and her weapon.\n\nThe story arc is a little predictable and some events could have been presented in more straightforward manners. Transistor has interesting characters and lore but a fair amount of it requires some critical thinking, assumption and the reading of hidden message terminals that share additional information about the city of Cloudbank and a mysterious event known as "The Process".\n\nThe story is overall pleasant, in large part due to the dramatic monologues of the man inside the Transistor. The game can be completed within 6 hours.\n\nGameplay\nA mix of fast-paced action and turned-based strategy best describes the game's mechanics. You'll explore a large (though linear) world and frequently encounter mobs of enemies. Using dozens of unlockable Functions, you can tailor your own combat builds in very specific ways for unique effects and take them to battle. Transistor's combat can be played in live action at full-speed or can be played in a turn-based manner by stopping time and planning attack sequences in advance. The latter is advantageous, as it allows you to use multiple moves in much quicker succession than is possible in full-speed action.\n\nYou'll be spending quite some time learning the different Functions and the different enemies and how they react to each other. When you're not fighting, you're exploring a distopian virtual city while listening to the melancholy of the man inside the Transistor.\n\nOh! One button is specially assigned to a singing mechanic; holding it makes Red hum to the tune of the music at any given time. Fun touch.\n\nVisuals\nYou know that feeling when you look at concept art for a game and think "Wow, this looks amazing!" and then the game itself looks somewhat underwhelming? Well, I have good news.\n\nTransistor itself looks like a breathing piece of concept art. Truly, the artistic vision for this game is surreal. Wearing a gorgeous sci-fi aesthetic, every asset of the game looks like a hand-painted oil painting and is pleasantly wed to modern computer-generated particles and lighting vfx.\n\nBreathtaking visuals. 'Nuff said.\n\nAudio\nTransistor is one of the very few games I've ever played where the audio has taken the spotlight.\n\nRightfully so, too, as the first thing you're welcomed with is a despondent whisper from a strange sword voiced by the talented Logan Cunningham and an ambient, upbeat tune that chillingly bears tones of alarm. It's a very harrowing start that wouldn't have been possible without the incredible audio direction.\n\nThe VO work is top of the line. With a small but carefully-selected cast, the characters are all given fantastic dialogue work. Logan Cunningham takes the forefront as the man inside the Transistor and nails his role perfectly.\n\nThe music might be my favourite aspect of the game. A 23-song OST filled with sci-fi prog, jazz and alternative rock in both instrumental and vocals flavors oozes with personality and strongly enforces the game's visual strength.\n\nThe tracks are wonderfully composed, mastered and played at the right times to exert emotion from the player. I'm still thinking of Ashley Barrett's "We All Become" everytime I think of Transistor. I seriously recommend getting the official soundtrack to this game.\n\nTechnical\nI have had no technical issues with the game except for one crash after about 6 hours of continuous gameplay. This was not much of a problem thanks to the frequent autosaves. The game otherwise features PC options you'd expect and supports controllers.\n\nThe TL;DR\nTransistor delivers a full, satisfying package on all fronts from the gorgeous art style to the enchanting soundtrack to the intricate gameplay mechanics driven by a conspiracy story involving a strange family and an even stranger city.\n\nI encourage the use of a controller. Lay back and relax. You're gonna have a good time.\n\nHey Red.

A while after finishing Bastion, a game made by the same developers, I found out about Transistor and could not wait to try it out. I went into this game blind, so I wouldn't have any high expectations. The only thing I knew about this game was that this game was going to be awesome and pretty. So after actually playing the game, I felt like it was worth every penny and even more than that.\n\nThe game has a beautiful storyline. I love the characters and the amazing voice acting, and the character development will make you love the protoganists or even the antagonists for sure. Fitting with the beautiful storyline comes the amazing graphics that the developers brought to you. Every stage, every fight, every moment is basically a breathtaking piece of art, hand-painted. Not to forget the beautiful soundtracks that each fit in their respective part in the game, keeping the atmosphere intact like you're stuck in another universe.\n\nBut don't let the radiance of the graphics and the fluent tunes distract you, because the combat mechanics are something to keep your attention on. It's original and not repetitive at all. You can unlock new abilities on the go, making you change your strategy from time to time because you keep getting more to play with. If you don't, you'll have a hard time beating the game.\n\nIn the end, if the game still hasn't gotten you in their grasp with their story, character development, graphics or music then it will try with the replayability that's available in this game. Finishing the game does not mean being done with it, because of the "Recursion" option, introducing procedural battle after finishing the end boss.\n\nIf you love a pretty game with a nice story, I definitely recommend buying it. If it's on a sale, then don't hesitate to buy it because it will definitely be worth it.","November 1, 2014","true","13.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This can have it's downsides, as there are certain loadouts which are clearly OP, but the fact that subplot can be found out by using attacks in different ways encourages you to experiment.\nOne of the highlights is certainly the soundtrack, which is both atmospheric and greatly adds to the game.\nThis game is certainly worth trying out, ever if it might not immidiately seem like your sort of game.","September 8, 2015","true","17.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

With the same "narrator", the same music composer, the same isometric camera angle and the same hand-painted artstyle. But there's so much more to the game mechanics of Transistor than those of Bastion. Each Funtion has 3 options to it. You can slot it as an attack, a passive or slot in onto another attack. With around 20 Fuctions in the game, that's a lot of depth.\n\nI did have some worries about the length, with the main story only lasting 5 hours, but then I "recurred" through the story, which randomised the combat and then I completed all of the challenges which more than made up for it.\n\nTransistor is fantastic.

I'm going to avoid spoilers in this, so I'll be mindfully vague at points.\n\nThe music is amazing.  I mean, if you just set it out on its own and listened to it, it is brilliant.  However, more than just that, the music is integral to the plot.  They use the music to tell the story via lyrics.  At times plot and music is blended so well it leads you to question whether they are diegetic or non-diegetic, not unlike brilliant pieces of film such as Trois Couleurs.\n\nThe graphics are aesthetically wonderful.  Myself, I've never been a big proponent of attemps to use realism in gaming, I far prefer a well done art style that fits the world we're playing in, and style is something that simply oozes out of Transistor.  From the usage of vibrant colours juxtaposed against stark white landscapes in later games to the deco styling prevalent throughout, you will drool over this game if you have any love of comics, art, or cartooning.  Absolutely wonderful.\n\nThe story is a strong narrative told in an unorthodox way.  I'll be honest, this won't be for everyone.  The story isn't spoonfed to you, you need to work for it a bit.  You have to unlock all 3 facets of all your functions, read between the lines of conversations between characters, listen to all the terminal reports and only then, at end game, do you really start to pull everything together into a functional whole.  If you take the time, however, it does make it worth your while.  The game paints a stark portrait of Orwell mixed with Huxley to create a world of immediate and meaningful gratification that overwhelms the populace's drive for freedom and the ability to stand against a tyranny, whether purposeful or merely incidental, from the people who control it.  Hardly new or different in terms of a story, but told very well and in an interesting way.\n\nThis game easily creeped into my top 5 of all time, can't recommend it heavily enough.","July 26, 2014","true","13.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Maybe. The writing is superb, subtle where it needs to be, but also quite funny, and, best of all, it actually ties really, really well into the gameplay mechanics. I won't get into details to avoid spoilers, but I'll say that Cloudbank is a fascinating setting, and unlike anything I've seen in other cyberpunk tales.\n\nIn my opinion, Bastion's main fault was the simplicity of its combat system. It wasn't bad by any means, but it also didn't allow for a lot of depth. Transistor fixed that and created one of the most engaging combat systems in recent memory in the process. It's a mix of real time and turn-based combat that works surprisingly well, where you can mix and match a number of skills, each of them tied to a character in the game, and the more you use them in different ways, the more you learn about the respective character. It's a great way to keep your playstyle constantly changing, and it ties really well into the story.\n\nDarren Korb is back and his music is as good as ever, possibly even better. Ashley Lynn Barrett voices the protagonist, Red, and the songs she sings are not only beautiful, they're all directly tied to the game's story.\n\nAnd finally, Logan Cunningham is back, which should be reason enough for you to buy this game.\n\n","November 1, 2014","true","15.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It plays very differently; while Bastion tested your reflexes, Transistor will test your pre-planning ability.\n\nTransistor has a V.A.T.S.-like core gameplay element that allows you to plan your attacks ahead, but unlike V.A.T.S. from Fallout, using this will leave you very open to attack. Using this function will disallow any offensive action until it recharges; so you must use it effectively because the enemies are much faster than you are. Especially the "Fetch" enemies which are basically like dogs that love to follow you around faster than your evade speed and chomp the ever loving ♥♥♥♥ out of you repeatedly.\n\nThe soundtrack is very different to bastion. I wouldn't say it doesn't live up to Bastion's, it's just very different in it's genres presented, and that is totally okay because it's still as great as you would expect from Supergiant Games and fits the cyberpunk setting very well.\n\nSpeaking of the setting, it's beautiful. I love how you get the sense that the creators had this whole other rich, lore filled world planned out in their head but could only make "Just a video game" about it. It's not expositioned to you as most games would do, it's just there, which is exactly what the secret to making a setting like this is supposed to be like, because it means that you get the feeling that even without the main character and their plight, it would still exist.\n\nI give this game a "Buy this right now"/10, even despite it's minor hiccups, which I will now list.\n\nEvery now and again, the game locks up for a few seconds. This is guesswork at best so take it with a grain of salt, but I believe it may be caused by an unoptimized sound cache reset because the dynamic soundtrack is played in chunks of audio that change and layer as you do certain things. It could also be an enemy spawning issue, but again, I don't know for sure. It's so minor and infrequent that it's just worth noting, although not really a bother, since it seems like something that can be patched out.\n\nThis has only happened in the challenge rooms so far, but some of the enemy capabilities are at odds with good gameplay design when their strengths are combined together. This one time, I accidentally knocked a "Cheerleader" (Basically a radar that makes enemies invincible) next to a vine, which heals other enemies. So the vine was healing the cheerleader, the cheerleader was shielding the vine, and the remaining fetch would go back to the vine to heal itself and be shielded every time I got it's health really low, and transistor time or whatever it's called wouldn't load fast enough to let me finish off the fetch before it did so. I'd show a screenshot of what happened, but there's currently an error with steam that won't let me upload it. Anyway, I had to restart the challenge map, but it never happened again thoughout the entire game.\n\nAnother thing is that this game, while very enjoyable, should be played in short bursts. I beat it in one 9 hour sitting, and it began to feel repetitive by the end, as any game would. Just when it started to change the enemy variety up by adding in the "Men" which are basically these enemies with special abilities that throw pretty much tracking explosives at you, the game ends. They're fun to fight, but they show up so late game that you barely have time to enjoy their presence, though I'm sure I'll see more of them on my New Game+ playthrough.\n\nThis one is a nitpick and not really necessary so disregard it if you wish, but: At the end there is a part where you fight an enemy who also has transistor time and can preplan attacks against you. The multiplayer potential for that is amazing, because the fight was actually very enjoyable. I would have loved a 2 player mode for that sequence that you unlock after beating the game, even if it was just local pvp on one PC/Console instead of over the internet, but I understand that there are probably engine limitations and whatnot so it's just a fleeting pipe dream.\n\nThe story, while very gripping and entertaining, didn't have any characters I could personally relate to or connect with, so when certain things happen throughout the game, I found it hard to really, truly care. But that's probably just because I'm a cynical ♥♥♥ hole, the writers told the story they wanted to and they did it effectively, even if some of the characters didn't really get much development outside of the biographies that add to themselves by the end of the game.\n\nAside from these issues though, I fully and wholeheartedly recommend this game. At $19.99 as a brand new price for this memorable experience of a game, you can't go wrong.","May 21, 2014","true","11.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Maybe.  Like the previous offering from Supergiant Games, Transistor delivers on multiple fronts:\n\n1. Visuals: Transistor is aesthetically beautiful in a way that few other games are and if Supergiant continues down this particular road, all of its games will be instantly recognizable.\n\n2. Sound: The same awesome narration with a new voice follows us into Transistor.  It's topped off by another beautiful soundtrack from the Supergiant team that you'll want to listen to many times after completing the game.\n\n3. Gameplay: Where some might have found the gameplay in Bastion a little simplified, Transistor kicks it up with a hybrid turn-based/real-time combat system, numerous weapon combinations and enemies with unique abilities that make battlefield strategizing more of a priority.\n\n4. Story: Perhaps the only place where I could knock this game, Transistor follows in the footsteps of Bastion with a couple interesting twists and a really solid story backed up by bits of in-game lore, but leaves some of the world-building up to player theorizing.  This can be a positive or negative depending on what you're looking for in a game.  Regardless, Transistor still manages to craft a compelling narrative that outstrips a lot of games on the market today.\n\nIn short: I can't think of any remotely good reason not to buy or recommend this game.  It's a great example of what happens when a group of developers and artists come together with a solid and unique vision and pull it off.","May 21, 2014","true","17.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It plays very differently; while Bastion tested your reflexes, Transistor will test your pre-planning ability.\n\nTransistor has a V.A.T.S.-like core gameplay element that allows you to plan your attacks ahead, but unlike V.A.T.S. from Fallout, using this will leave you very open to attack. Using this function will disallow any offensive action until it recharges; so you must use it effectively because the enemies are much faster than you are. Especially the "Fetch" enemies which are basically like dogs that love to follow you around faster than your evade speed and chomp the ever loving ♥♥♥♥ out of you repeatedly.\n\nThe soundtrack is very different to bastion. I wouldn't say it doesn't live up to Bastion's, it's just very different in it's genres presented, and that is totally okay because it's still as great as you would expect from Supergiant Games and fits the cyberpunk setting very well.\n\nSpeaking of the setting, it's beautiful. I love how you get the sense that the creators had this whole other rich, lore filled world planned out in their head but could only make "Just a video game" about it. It's not expositioned to you as most games would do, it's just there, which is exactly what the secret to making a setting like this is supposed to be like, because it means that you get the feeling that even without the main character and their plight, it would still exist.\n\nI give this game a "Buy this right now"/10, even despite it's minor hiccups, which I will now list.\n\nEvery now and again, the game locks up for a few seconds. This is guesswork at best so take it with a grain of salt, but I believe it may be caused by an unoptimized sound cache reset because the dynamic soundtrack is played in chunks of audio that change and layer as you do certain things. It could also be an enemy spawning issue, but again, I don't know for sure. It's so minor and infrequent that it's just worth noting, although not really a bother, since it seems like something that can be patched out.\n\nThis has only happened in the challenge rooms so far, but some of the enemy capabilities are at odds with good gameplay design when their strengths are combined together. This one time, I accidentally knocked a "Cheerleader" (Basically a radar that makes enemies invincible) next to a vine, which heals other enemies.

At the time it came out I didn't even had a chance to put my hands on Supergiant Games Bastion, so I had to play it first, so I could feel the style of its developer. And now that I played both I can say that the game feel was surely saved (if not enhanced). The graphics are just fascinating. Bastion also has great visuals, but the setting here is different and comparing these two is kind of stupid. Can say the same about the music. As a Kid, you had to put up a new home for yourself and the others, you were the only hope, the person that felt kind of sad and scared of the burden, but on the other hand brave and ready for the unexpected. And so is the music. Transistor puts you in a sci-fi city, and the situation Red is in is really tough - her voice is stolen, the man that is close to her heart is stabbed with a somewhat electronic sword, and there is a group of people that are chasing her. Most songs have that post-rock feel to them, which made me melancholic and sad, and relaxed at the same time. But there is one thing I'm sure about - the soundtrack to Transistor is something else.\nSince it's hard to not to compare it to Bastion, I need to say one thing - it really is a great enchanting game, but Bastion is a bit better, imo. There are not much games that give you goosebumps, but both of the games did that to me. !!Bastion Spoilers!! The part where you're carrying Zulf back to the Bastion, accompanied by the Setting Sale, Coming Home song was much more impressive than the Transistor ending. Maybe the culmination part of Transistor should have the ending song being played during it, but anyway, that's just my opinion. Transistor is still a great game, and it's definitely 10/10.

Well, in two ways in specific. The first is just how aesthetically pleasing this game is. The world, abilities, enemies, music and artwork is all really well done. The ability system is fun and I find myself wanting a Diablo style game to incorporate a system similar to this because I think it's well done and gives you a lot of customization. The combat is meh, the pacing is meh, the length of the story is very meh and, to me, the ending was meh. I don't know... I was super excited for this game for a LONG time, and can't really say it was worth the 20 dollars. I'll play through it again at a slower pace now that I know just how much every second counts and might edit this review, but I kind of doubt it. It was a decent experience, but wait until it's on sale. If you're cool with time trials and whatnot, you'll probably get a bit more time out of it than I did.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uwonyao/recommended/237930/","uwonyao","uwon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uwonyao/","197 products in account","If The Great Gatsby were a video game I really don't write a lot of reviews, like, at all. But I enjoyed this game so much; it physically compelled me to do so. Rarely has a video game caused me to spout praises about it to millions of strangers on the interwebs. This one did, big time.\n\nArtistic direction, plot development (no spoilers)\nIt's hard to talk about this game without mentioning the stylized presentation. Transistor shows influences from Supergiant's previous game, Bastion. Whereas Bastion's toon-like presentation contrasted with the somber themes the game explored, in Transistor, the developers made the game feel almost impressionistic. Cutscenes and plot elements are introduced in parts and pieces on a background palette of neon lights and gilded society. Much like how Bioshock gives you the choice of picking up optional voxaphones, the clarifying parts of Transistor's story are introduced via optional newscasts and recordings. The female protagonist looks like she stepped out from the Roaring Twenties, and the game feels and plays like a jaunt through The Great Gatsby if the book also featured murderous enemies at every turn. The protagonist's accomplice will narrate and banter with her throughout the game. Plot elements are introduced organically, and it's almost too easy to feel the emotions behind choices and actions the protagonist takes despite her being pretty much mute for the entire game. I found myself satisfied in almost every artistic aspect.\n\nMusic and voice acting\nThe original soundtrack. Is. Awesome. The writter and producer of the soundtrack, Darren Korb, describes the music as "old-world electronic post-rock." Ashley Barrett, who sings many of the lyrical songs in the game, is suberb at giving the protagonist's (past) voice. The music strikes that rare balance where if you stop to appreciate it, it may just steal your breath away, but it's never intrusive when you're getting mauled by enemies in the heat of battle. Narration by the protagonist's accomplice is sassy, hilarious, conversational, and at times heartwrenching. It gives a sense of how the two interacted with one another in the past. Other characters who make appearances are memorable and unique; each character has their own linguistic quirks that differentiate their speakers. Nothing cookie cutter here.\n\nGameplay\nCombat is tight, clean, and rewarding. Gameplay happens in real-time, but the protagonist has the ability to pause time and lay out a series of combat moves reminiscent of KOTOR or X-Com. Battle abilities are acquired sequentially through plot and with every level the protagonist gains, and they can be mixed and matched to create endless variability, damage potential, and combat philosophies. Each ability is linked with character backstory that is unlocked through use, which encourages you to try novel combinations of skills. Enemies scale in difficulty reasonably and foes behave logically. They will heal damaged allies. They will buff their tank as he smashes your face in. And they will cause headaches for you if you aren't careful. For added challenge, the game features handicaps that make gameplay much harder but will reward the protagonist bonus experience. There is also a built-in, plot appropriate haven of sorts that the protagonist can access for scenario battles and a sandbox practice mode. After the first playthrough, you have the option of starting over again with a game-plus mode, retaining all progress with enemies starting out much stronger. It is one of the few games where I didn't think twice about playing the game again right after I beat it. And I played it until I got every single achievement and searched every single corner. It made me neglect basic necessities like eating. And sleep. And personal hygiene. And I didn't mind.\n\nOverall\nWhile writing this review, it was actually quite difficult for me to separate discrete pieces of this game into music, gameplay, etc. It is such a well integrated package that one aspect is in complete alignment with another. Gameplay introduces plot. Narrative augments gameplay. And the art pulls you into the gameplay. And the feels. Oh, does this game have the feels. The only other game that I can remember that has left me feeling like this is Portal. They are both a bit on the shorter side in terms of gameplay length, but the density of gameplay is tremendous. The white dwarf star of games really. Every moment feels meaningful, nothing is drawn out. There are no ♥♥♥♥♥♥ parts to this game. It is pure, concentrated fun with a shot of the feels right where it hurts. But it hurts so good.\n\n10/10 would (and did) play this game again (and again). And I honestly think this game is worth its full retail price.","December 16, 2014","true","18.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Well, in two ways in specific. The first is just how aesthetically pleasing this game is. The world, abilities, enemies, music and artwork is all really well done. The ability system is fun and I find myself wanting a Diablo style game to incorporate a system similar to this because I think it's well done and gives you a lot of customization. The combat is meh, the pacing is meh, the length of the story is very meh and, to me, the ending was meh. I don't know... I was super excited for this game for a LONG time, and can't really say it was worth the 20 dollars. I'll play through it again at a slower pace now that I know just how much every second counts and might edit this review, but I kind of doubt it. It was a decent experience, but wait until it's on sale. If you're cool with time trials and whatnot, you'll probably get a bit more time out of it than I did. But, for me, when you have a setting this cool and the story is so forced and short, it in no way was very satisfying.","May 23, 2014","true","5.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Universo Cyberpunk. ¿Protagonista? Red, una famosa cantante a quien le quitaron su voz. ¿Historia? Despertamos al lado de nuestro novio, quien ha sido a♥♥♥♥♥♥ado por una espada, Transistor. ¿Llega al nivel del Bastion? Totalmente pero a pesar de asemejarse en muchos aspectos, también se diferencia en muchos otros.\n\nLa ciudad de Cloudbank está siendo atacada por el Proceso, un ejército de inteligencia robótica que está acabando con distintas personas de influencia, como Red. Los responsables de estos ataques son The Camerata, un grupo integrado por cuatro personas interesadas por recuperar la espada y a los cuales perseguiremos en busca de respuestas. El trasfondo de los mismos es muy interesante, cuentan con una personalidad y motivos muy definidos.\n\nLa  protagonista no estará sola, ya que el hombre que encontramos a nuestro lado y fue “capturado” por Transistor nos hablará (al estilo de Rucks) y guiará para que descubramos de a poco quién es. O quién era.\n\nEl estilo del juego puede parecer similar a simple vista, pero acá se ve un combate mucho más profundo, con la novedad de poder pausar el combate y planear nuestros ataques. En este estado utilizaremos puntos de acción (dependiendo la habilidad nuestros movimientos serán mayores o menores) y tendremos bonificaciones de experiencia si encadenamos combos correctamente.\n\nEn esta oportunidad tenemos a nuestra disposición 4 ataques para elegir que iremos encontrando a lo largo del juego y podremos disponer muchas combinaciones entre ellas- ya sea utilizándolas para atacar o para mejorar otro poder-.\n\nEn ciertos lugares de la ciudad, podemos acceder a una sala llamada Sandbox, un segmento de playa donde podremos descansar, escuchar canciones del juego mientras disfrutamos una vista increíble (me he quedado horas utilizando este lugar como reproductor de música) y nuevamente aparecen Challenges bastante difíciles, que nos darán experiencia y nuevos tracks para disfrutar.\n\nVisualmente es hermoso, no hay otra palabra para describirlo. Cada rincón, personaje, enemigo y detalle brilla por si solo.\n\nMención especial al soundtrack que nuevamente es un placer para nuestros oídos, con un estilo muy acorde a la atmósfera del juego. Tenemos la posibilidad de hacer que Red tararee la canción que está sonando en ese momento cosa que hará también automáticamente cuando pausemos el combate.\n\nLuego de finalizar la historia, desbloquearemos el modo New Game +, en el cuál podemos comenzar de nuevo manteniendo nuestros upgrades e items, pero también sucederán cosas nuevas y aparecen ciertos guiños, lo que resulta en una experiencia distinta y no tan forzosa. El juego en sí no es muy largo y seguro se queden con ganas de más (aunque tiene un final más que satisfactorio),  en todo caso si no están seguros pueden esperar a una oferta y conseguirlo a menor precio  (en mi opinión, vale su full price).","September 6, 2015","true","11.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The combat is mostly turn based and there's no environment hazards other than enemies. The system for selecting skills and upgrades is very unique and really encourages trying different combinations. I like how the complexity grows over time, but never feels overwhelming. It has the same clever system as Bastion for customizing the difficulty with debuffs for rewards.\n\nThe story is bat-♥♥♥♥ insane, even more so than Bastion. It turns out to be a similar sort of apocalypse, but it feels like most of the collapsing is happening offscreen. I don’t really follow how all the character including your own fits into it. At the same time this makes the world feel very massive.\n\nI miss the destructible and animating environments of Bastion, but these are incredibly beautiful. All the character an enemy design is wonderful. The music is amazingly good, but is much harder to describe than Bastion’s mix of Indian and Western.\n\nIt’s tough to live in the shadow of Bastion. This isn’t my favorite game this year and didn’t meet my very high expectations, but I still like almost everything about it and was left wanting more. It probably the most stylish turn-based combat games I’ve ever played. It’s pretty different from almost anything else I’ve ever played including Bastion, so it’s worth experiencing for that.\n","June 27, 2014","true","10.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

If I present an obvious bias or compare the two games on unfair grounds, then I appologise in advance.\nFirst let us discuss what Transistor does right. The gameplay presented is the same isometric world navigation that was apparant in Bastion, the major difference being its approach to combat. It abandons the hectic run-and-gun/hammer skirmishes of the former and instead takes a far more intelligent plan and execute method. The player can temporarily pause time and plan out their battle strategy before hitting the pause button again and watching it play out at lightning speeds. The numerous variaties of enemies and the layouts of the battlefields provide ample chances to scratch that 'General Chessmaster' itch. The massive amount of weapons (called 'functions()') alsoadd to the tactical depth of this game. Each weapon can be equiped in one of four wepon slots, where it functions normally, firing lasers, dropping bombs etc. Each weapon may also be assigned to either a passive slot, providing you a powerful, perk-like bonus, or to an upgrade slot, in which one weapon buffs the other (LASERS THAT ALSO DROP BOMBS!?). The amount of combinations is truely staggering and will be greatly apprieciated by gamers who like a more intelligent approach to their combat (myself included).\nNext the art style. Although the more charming cartoon-like character proportions from Bastion are gone in favor of a more realistic-(ish) art style, the vibrant colours and tones make a glorious return. The mood and the tone of various scenes are masterfully enchanced by use of reccuring temperatures and unique art assets. The forboding height of Coudbank City, as presented soon after the beggining of the game, is alleviated by the cool yellow and blue lighting, giving it a more distant, lonesome feeling, to give one example.\nAnd the soundtrack, oh my, the soundtrack. I was so thrilled to hear that Darren Korb would be returning and boy does he deliver in the audio department. Echoing guitar riffs and droning synthesizers, alongside beautifully melancholic vocals do wonders to nail the sad, lonely cyberpunk feel that is so greatly apprieciated by big nerds such as myself. Particular standouts for me are 'In Circles,' 'Forecast' and 'The Spine.'\nAnd now to cover what I personally was let down by. The story. WAIT! Allow me to expand. (No spoilers don't fret!) The characters themselves are very nicely portrayed, with excellent moments of individual characterisation, but I took issue with the game's plot, its over-arching story. You are dropped right into the world with zero idea of who these characters are, where you are, or what the hell is going on in general. 'But that happened in Bastion too!' I hear you shout. Yes you woke up in a floating bed in Bastion with zero understanding of what was happening, but this created a sense of wonder as the game's  plot was quickly given to you, (The world blew up, but the Bastion can fix it) and as you progressed the world, characters and other various story flavor was gradually revealed to you in satisfying amounts from level to level. And most importantly by the game's end all questions had been answered. This is not the case with Transistor. Although it does a good job with the aforementioned characterisation and also with the same story flavor being drip fed to you, major components of the the plot are flat out not explained, which frustrated me greatly as it gave me difficulty in understanding vital things such as character motivations. These questions are also not addressed, or at least not in any way a near satisfactory level, by the games end. The final boss in particular was very confusing for me, the fight itself comes out of nowhere and takes place in a very strange location and I found myself thinking 'WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING? WHY ARE WE FIGHTING NOW? WHERE-WHA-BUT I DIDN'T.........' and soon after the fight the game ends. The ending itself is rather emotional, but I couldn't get into the mood the game wanted me to due to my extreme frustration and confusuion owing to the fact that the credits were rolling and my questions had not been answered. Now I'm not some fool who only enjoys simple by-the-numbers stories, I understand that not all questions need to be answered, but jesus christ SOME would have been nice. Thematically , the game is not as strong as Bastion. It is clearly attempting to make commentary on topics such as the irrelevance of an individual in a system, and the fickleness of the general public but it falls flat if suitable context is not provided.\nTo summerise: Wonderfully cereberal combat with powerfull art and sound direction that is only let down by its adequately explained story. Or maybe I'm just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.","May 21, 2014","true","17.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

To those of you who do not know the majesty of Supergiant games, Bastion and Transistor both share epic qualities that seem to be missing from most games today.\n\nIn the simplest way to define Transistor: this is art, truly inspired art. I'm literally at a loss when it comes to reviewing this game. Supergiant manages to pull you into their story and make you feel like you are a part of it. Each character has some unique facet about them that can intrigue the player. Abilities are explained through some fabrication of a character's life. Everything has its mark in Transistor's world. The story is simply magnificent and a main driving point to the game.\n\nAs a player, your eyes are met with a glorious palette of colors uniquely blended across the canvas of the game world. Every building, every character, and even every enemy, meshes together in loving unison. Nothing seems out of place and it all looks beautiful. Also, without fail, Supergiant delivers another amazing soundtrack for their game -- to compliment the beautiful scenery and character design, the background music is just as eloquent and wonderous. And to add to the soundtrack even more, the in-game music can be interacted with with the main character. Have you no will to play the game,  the soundtrack alone is worth the price.\n\nAs short of a review as this may be, Supergiant did not disappoint -- not even in the slightest. I would highly recommend playing Transistor AND Bastion, if you haven't already. Thanks for your time.\n\n*Disclaimer: This is an opinion, obviously. You do not need to agree :p","May 24, 2014","true","11.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/symb0lic/recommended/237930/","symb0lic","King Eccy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/symb0lic/","194 products in account","Bastion  was my favourite game of 2011. So you could say I was highly anticipating  Supergiant Games  next release -- which was revealed to be  Transistor  in 2013. After a long and patient wait, I've completed Transistor and I would like to share some of my thoughts and perhaps answer how it stacks up to Bastion.\n\nThe story revolves around a character called  Red , who seems to be a singer superstar in the city of Cloudbank. After Red wakes up from an assassination attempt by a sinister group of high ranking public figures known as  The Camerata  and realising her voice was also stolen... Red pulls The Transistor out of a mysterious body next to her, and attempts to unravel what exactly happened to her. Little does she know though, that The Transistor can talk, and actually seems to know her. As Red starts to make her way out of the district, she is attacked by an army of robotic intelligences known as  The Process , who seem to be controlled by The Camerata.\n\nThe story is more abstract, subtle and darker this time. I would say the story is not as immediatetely likeable as Bastion's story -- as the narrator for Bastion basically narrated and spelled everything out for you in a clearer way. In Transistor, the narrator is also your companion,  (voiced by Logan Cunningham once again, though with a much less gravelly and cool sounding tone) . You are more encouraged to explore the world this time to find out more about Cloudbank's lore instead of relying on the narrator.\n\nWhat is amazing is how the story also mechanically ties into the gameplay . You come across various slain characters in the story that you absorb into The Transistor, gaining new abilities. Abilities are multifaceted, so each ability can be used as an active/upgrade/passive and can be mixed and matched for some cool possibilities. You unlock character lore by using each ability in one of the 3 types of slots. It's quite a brilliant and elegant way of doing lore if I must say so myself.\n\nYou have 4 ability slots which can be upgraded (via leveling up) to have 2 upgrade slots each and you can also unlock 4 passive slots. As you can imagine, this gives Transistor much more depth and customisability this time around compared to Bastion. You can play the game in real time like any normal ARPG... but Transistor also adds a layer of strategic depth with it's new feature called the planning stage -- letting you pause, queue and plan your attacks (with a short global cooldown for all your abilities as a penalty).\n\nThere is no overworld hub this time like in Bastion, but you do come across back doors -- taking you to a mini oasis of sorts. Here is where you can access all of the challenges known as  tests . Beating each test unlocks a track for you to listen to. Supergiant also added a feature where if you press tab, Red can hum to every track in the game. I love and appreciate this small attention to detail. You can also gaze up at the stars on your hammock and listen to what the Transistor has to say on your current situation and also play with your process dog named Luna (Dota reference?).\n\nThe idol system from Bastion also makes its return, but in the form of limiters in Transistor. Limiters can be toggled on and off making the game harder but also granting more experience with each limiter you enable (up to 10 limiters). Limiters also have their own lore to be unlocked by using them at least once. The game becomes VERY CHALLENGING with 10 limiters enabled and is not for the feint of heart.\n\nThe music for Transistor is also incredible once again. It has a bit more of a jazzy and eery sci-fi vibe this time compared to the more upbeat tunes of Bastion. In only 2 games, Darren Korb has cermented himself as one of my favourite game composers of all time. Instant classics, and I can't wait to hear more from this very talented man.\n\nNow, I'm praising this game to the high heavens, but what are some of my  dislikes ? Every time you are taken to 0 health, one of your abilities will be overloaded, and can't be used until you reach the next checkpoint. It is a unique way of handling failure, but I didn't really like the idea of having your skills being stripped from you as it can basically ruin the idea of your build if you make a mistake. It also seems random on what skill you will lose -- which is  severely  punishing -- especially when you are trying to complete some of the later performance tests where if you lose 1 crucial skill, you basically have no hope of finishing the test without restarting the whole test and playing flawlessly. The developers also forgot to add a restart test option to the menu which was frustrating when you are attempting them over and over. Frankly, I also didn't think the tests/challenges were as well designed as they were in Bastion.\n\nTransistor is another monumental achievement by Supergiant Games. It shows they are maturing as a developer. Some people probably thought Bastion's narrator was a bit of a gimmick, and that the story was all it had going for it. Transistor shows that Supergiant also understand how to craft a more mechanically deep and subtle game this time, while still sticking to their strengths of unique story-telling via narration and music.","May 25, 2014","true","17.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueRaja/recommended/237930/","BlueRaja","BlueRaja","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueRaja/","2289 products in account","MUSIC AND ARTWORK:\nAbsolutely fantastic.  They do a wonderful job together of drawing you into this surreal world.\n10/10\n\nUI:\nFlawless.  UI's in games are usually pretty bad, and I'm a UI-stickler.  However, this game's UI was clearly carefully thought-out by a professional.  It always contained all the information I needed, yet was never in the way.  There was never a time I wanted to do something and thought to myself "Crap, how do I do that again?"\n10/10\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe fighting in this game looks artificially similar to Bastion, but the ability to pause the action and execute multiple attacks in succession makes it feel completely different.  The battles end up being much more about turn-based tactics than quick reflexes.\n\nDifferent powers are unlocked throughout the course of the game.  Each power can be used as an attack, an upgrade to a different attack, or a passive boost.  This mixing-and-matching opens up a wide variety of strategies for each fight; if one matchup of powers doesn't work well for a fight, you can try again with a *completely* different strategy.  This keeps the game fresh and interesting, even on subsequent playthroughs.\n\nOn the forums, many people complained about the battles being repetative, but I completely disagree; due to your ability to completely change your lineup of powers, every battle felt fresh and interesting.\n\nMy one complaint is that you only start out with three (I think?) powers, so you have to wait a short while before you can make the more interesting matchups.  And since the game is so short, "a short while" ends up being half of the game.\n8/10\n\nSTORY:\nThis is where things turn sour.  The story in this game is very open-ended, to the point of being lazy.  It's (obviously) difficult to critique the story without giving any spoilers, but suffice it to say there are a LOT of story-elements that are never explained or even hinted at.\n\n**Minor spoilers ahead** (but I'll keep things vague to avoid ruining the story)\n\nAll of the characters are hilariously under-developed, even (or *especially*) the main two.  It's to the point where, when you fight one of the bosses, you not only don't feel anything when they die, you don't even know why you're fighting them to begin with.  Also, one very obvious lead-up to a boss-fight ends in a very contrived, almost non-sensical Deus Ex Machina.\n\nAs for the the main two characters, you end up not caring what happens to them, because you barely know anything about them.  On top of that, the ending feels incredibly forced and out-of-place.\n\nThe whole thing reeks of lazy writing.\n\n**End of minor spoilers**\n2/10\n\nGAME LENGTH:\nThe game is pretty short - only about 5 hours long, and that's *if* you complete all the side-challenges you can.  The game feels like the creators had planned on there being more content, since all of the side quest-y stuff (unlocking all the character-stories, finishing the side-challenges, the majority of the optional achievements) are impossible to complete in a single playthrough - you don't meet enough enemies or enter the "Backdoor" enough times to complete them.\n\nIt feels like at some point the developers said "I think we've worked hard enough, let's just polish and release it already," so they did.  This is corroborated by how incomplete the storyline is.\n5/10\n\nOVERALL\nI don't regret my purchase, but I was expecting more.  Some people will think the gameplay and wonderful atmosphere make the game worth $20, even if it's so short and lacking on story (or, if you're the artsy type, maybe you enjoy open-ended stories).  Others will feel betrayed by the lack of content.  Depending on which type of person you are, I'd either recommend buying it now, or waiting for a sale, respectively.  But either way, I think it's worth playing.\n8/10","May 27, 2014","true","9.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

After doing all challenges, listening to and reading everything I possibly could and only once having to use the "Retry" function, Steam tells me I have 7 hours under my belt.\n\nThe following is my critique of the game, ignoring the New Game+ mode (for now). While I do reference Supergiant Games' first title, Bastion, quite heavily, the points I make should also be accessible to players who have yet to play Bastion (seriously, get that game). While I try to be objective, some sections of this review are highly subjective; the game suffers from virtually no technical (and thus "objectively objective") faults and what I point out as bad may appear as "creative" or "challenging" or just "different" to others.\nPlease refer to additional reviews and critiques before you decide whether or not you want to buy Transistor.\n\nTHIS CRITIQUE CONTAINS VERY MINOR SPOILERS!\nIf you want to avoid even those, skip to the conclusion section at the end.\n\nTransistor is an isometric tactical Action-RPG with a linear story.\n\nFirst of all, the things I was happy with - THE GOOD:\n- The MUSIC, obviously. Darren Korb and Ashley Barret did an amazing job and the music leaves little to be desired. It's a different style than Bastion's soundtrack, so, of course, whether you like it more or less than Bastion's is a matter of taste, but it is very atmospheric and carries the game together with\n- LOGAN CUNNINGHAM'S NARRATION. No surprises there. The music may be the soul of the game but the expert narration (and fantastic voice acting) are its heart.\n- The DESIGN. The world of Transistor is original and colorful; the "feel" is the same as in Bastion but it has a distinctly different theme; the result is stellar.\n- CUSTOMIZATION. The ability to collect a variety of skills, all of them with different effects, depending on whether they are active, passive or modifying an active skill, makes for some interesting (and tough) choices as to how you want to play. Not everything works well but you can try everything.\n\nNow to the things that I was less impressed with - THE MEH:\n- The COMBAT SYSTEM. Sadly, it is nowhere near as great as (I) expected. Precision is not its strong point and those who were hoping for Frozen Synapse levels of refined tactical combat will be disappointed, as will be those that expected a slick Hack&Slash. Some sections are almost impossible to beat with only one of the modes but intelligent use of both does not help in all situations and more often than not (especially later on), you can find yourself cheesing the game in less-than-fun ways when you encounter fights that are frustrating enough that you'd like to skip them, due to issues with\n- The BALANCING. Few enemies are balls-to-the-wall hard, but many are insanely annoying. Having to deal with enemies who have the ability to cloak themselves (which, somehow, also makes them invulnerable) without the player having any way to disrupt this cloak (other than waiting for them to deal damage to you) or to damage them in cloak makes several mid- and endgame sections downright infuriating. Especially if said enemies are rapidly regenerating health. Several enemy attacks cannot be avoided and the player's ability to heal himself is extremely limited, making the whole combat system less a matter of skill and more one of a proper choice of abilities (which is where the combat system is at odds with its RPG elements); due to this, some fights (especially boss fights) and victories are anything but satisfying and can leave a bitter aftertaste.\n- The CHARACTERS. While Bastion had only a few characters with little depth but strong-enough features to make them relatable and carry the story, Transistor has almost none. "The voice" is the strongest one by far but remains a lot more blank than Bastion's narrator. The female lead, Red, has even less than that (or Bastion's Kid). The human antagonists are hardly characterized at all and what remains is a faceless menace that changes the world around you and attacks you constantly... and yet fails to really make you feel threatened.\n- The STORY. Where Bastion's story was about a simple goal for most of the game (restoring the Bastion), Transistor lacks direction. You feel like a tourist who is being guided from one landmark to the other without any drive or ultimate goal behind it, which becomes even more apparent at the game's conclusion. The plot works with local tension only (i.e. short-term obstacles and goals). The lack of strong characters makes it hard to build-up a bad guy and the pace at which the city changes and the threat swallows it leaves no time to make you care about it or its inhabitants. Unlike the Bastion, you didn't build it with your own two hands and, despite being in a city, you never get a chance to interact with anybody. This leaves the romance as its only redeeming factor... except it isn't either, because the main characters' interaction is very one-sided. The sad truth is: Transistor's story is forgetable.\n\n\nAnd finally - THE BAD:\n- WORLD DESIGN (SCOPE AND DEPTH). While the design is great, you hardly see anything of the city (or the rest of the world). Vistas are few and far between and the game doesn't feature any maps or background information that allows you to see the "big picture". Sadly, this devaluates most of the ingame biographies and what lore there is because it becomes that much harder to relate to for their lack of context.\n- The ENDING. It certainly isn't Mass Effect 3 levels of terrible but, frankly, it makes no sense. The game's conclusion renders pretty much the entire hero's journey pointless and I have to ask what motivation Red had in the first place. That isn't to say that it isn't beautiful in several ways but nonetheless highly disappointing if you were hoping for a well-written story.\n- The LENGTH. From what I have heard from several people, 7 hours is not a good time. It is quite possible to beat the game in under 5 hours. New Game+ may add replay value here, if you truly enjoyed the combat system and don't share my gripes with it, but if you don't, it leaves the question of value for your money. And, regardless of New Game+, my impression is that the game tries to do too much in too little time - Introducing you to a world, threatening this world and making you its involuntary savior has worked before... but it doesn't work for Transistor.\n\nMY VERDICT: (Or: tl;dr)\nTransistor is a good attempt to solve a task that was almost unsolvable - To create the next "Bastion". Design-wise, it is every bit as strong and a true treat for the eyes and ears, with some great ideas on how to keep progression interesting and your game experience unique.\nBut a closer look reveals a system that tries to combine real-time and tactical combat and, as a result, is the master of neither. The beautiful world that seems so full and interesting is a facade, a mere stage decoration with too little behind it to keep it from falling over when leaned on, leaving a lot of the ingame lore without sufficient context. And while music and narration are great, they cannot hide the fact that the play itself is boring and the characters forgotten as soon as they leave the stage.\nSupergiant Games gave their game and its world too little time to introduce themselves and captivate you and the result is all the more disappointing for it.\n\nNevertheless, I recommend Transistor for the interesting experience it is; you may find the combat system and story, despite their flaws, more satisfying than I did and, either way, you do not want to miss out on the soundtrack and Logan Cunningham's sexy voice. Supergiant Games deserves the money for a brave attempt, even if this attempt falls short.\nIf you aren't dying to play Transistor right now, pick it up once it goes on sale.","May 20, 2014","true","7.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Where the style has evolved into a futuristic, neon-lit, already built level. The world does no longer face the problem of falling apart, but instead it is losing it's style. “The Process”---the equivalent of “The Calamity” in Bastion---covers the creativity made from humans, with a grayscaled and blocky veneer, which seems detrimental to this particular game, where style is easily the highpoint of the experience. The music this time around leaves the closeness of acoustic guitar picking(except for the beach soundtrack) and goes for a more distant, electronic and futuristic atmosphere. Distorted electric guitars and heavy bass lines accorded with ambiance make Transistor a sonically sound experience. The story is very reminiscent of Bastion, but yet completely different. Transistors style and sound design, as with Bastion, perfectly accompanied each other. At points I felt like the levels were specifically made with the soundtrack in mind, because it was so eerily well thought out.\n\nWe start of as Red, a singer that lost her voice(it found its way to the soundtrack, though). Standing above a man with a sword in his chest. This sword can talk to us, and also play the roll as narrator. Why only this man can speak through the weapon is unknown to me, since the player ingest other fallen men and women and gain powers through this procedure, but not their voices as with the first body. At this point of the game we don't know who this man is or why we should follow his advice or directions, but it's a game, so we do it anyway. We progress through the levels and gradually begin to understand the situation, “The Process” was a failed experiment from “The Camerata” and the city is conveniently told to evacuate, so we can have that barren emptiness that is so effective when it comes to atmosphere. And The Process is what haunts us throughout the game. As we try to get to the bottom of what happened.\n\nThe vagueness and convolution of the story straddles the line of being annoyingly vague and mysterious and intriguing. Where at some points I feel the story would be better told if you knew some of the things you are told in the end. That would make everything feel more natural. In this mysteriousness, the story was overshadowed by the stylistic choices and obligatory gameplay sections. It's unfortunate when Transistor could have been both if they just dropped any pretensions of being deeper and having more substance than there really was. When you get to the end of this two hour game, things will be rather clear, but you will also feel like there should be more, where there are hints and ways the story could have gone that were never shut down or explored in a satisfying way. Despite it not feeling as fulfilling as it seemed to have the potential for, it was enjoyable and the game easily grabbed you and kept you interested up until the end.\n\nThe gameplay seems to be a rather contentious subject. I for one, sort of liked it. You could play it like in Bastion, hack and slash, designing your “build” for this purpose. Or you could go a more tactical way, as with a controller I thought would be more suiting. And it was! Although the combat often boiled down to using your tactical slow down time mechanism, killing one foe to then run around, trying not to die until the cooldown ran out, I really enjoyed it. There was tension in that way of playing, trying to just avoid getting hit, spamming RT. While some abilities seemed useless to me, most of them were used at some point due to the fact that you lose an ability when you lose all your health. This was a clever way of making the player use all the different devices, but it's equally as dumb when you have you remake your whole build every time you “die”. The frustration of having to go in to the these access points and try to manage your attacks when half of the things you want to use are unusable somewhat breaks immersion. See Transistor tries to squeeze in a whole bunch of different attacks and combinations into, what was for me, a two hour experience. Perhaps if the game was longer and had more uses for some of the attacks, this wouldn't be so jarring and above all boring. However, when you had the attacks you wanted, with the combinations and everything, the gameplay was a lot of fun. Beautiful colors emitted from every blow, cool sound design and every attack felt more or less powerful, but alas, that didn't mean they were.\n\nAll in all it's neat parcel. Well worth it for the creativity. The clumsiness of some decisions didn't come close to ruining the experience whatsoever. So it's a worthy successor to Bastion, and it will probably stay in the same place in my mind as Bastion. As a memory of a stylistically and sonically amazing experience, while the gameplay and storytelling will surely fade out of the collective memory, sooner or later.","May 21, 2014","true","2.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/codenamechosenone/recommended/237930/","codenamechosenone","Codename: Riesenlaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/codenamechosenone/","130 products in account","Alright, I'm going to say this first: A year ago, when the first trailer of this game was revealed, I cried so much. Not only was this going to be another game from SuperGiantGames, the creators of one of my favorite games, Bastion, but the trailer was excellent, blending in beautiful music with awesome gameplay and cutscenes. I forgot about the game over time, with college and projects distracting me, and it was only until a month ago that my love for the game returned. Just like many fans of the game, I was "riding the hype train" as the release date got nearer and nearer. As soon as it was on Steam I preordered it and the soundtrack, which was $30 out of my wallet.\n\nWas it worth it? Very much so. I might be still riding the hype train some, but I can still recognize the positive and negative aspects this game has.\n\n\nStory\n------------------------------------------------\n\nI was rather surprised on how the story went. Instead of focusing on Red as the character who advances the story, I found that the Transistor, the sword-like weapon she wields, did most of that job for her. It talks and knows her in some way, but also Red is somewhat of a silent protagonist. She's not like Gordon Freeman from the Half-Life series or Chell from Portal, as you can make her hum by holding the tab button (when I learned I could do that I squeed loudly), but is mostly silent throughout the game. Players will understand why this is early on in the game. Still though, Red and the Transistor work well together and make an amazing duo.\n\nThe Transistor, being both a main character and the main tool of the player, is not some ethereal being with all the answers. It acts more like a regular person, one that feels love and courage and a sense of honor. This personality, plus Red, can make the player feel attached to both characters as they bond throughout the game. During my playthrough, I got to a scene where the pair finds a bath house and Red proceeds to wash herself. Of course the actually washing isn't shown, but the way the Transistor reacted to this made me laugh. That's what really showed me the Transistor's regular personality.\n\nI did enjoy the story as a whole and the ending is a must-see. However, I was disappointed that not much was explained about the setting of the game. If one is to save a city/ town/ country/ etc they should know the importance of it. Yes there are a lot of people in Cloudbank, some very good people, but I would have like to know more about the actual. "How did it come to be?" "What was in the city that made it so grand?" "What was the economic structure before everything went to hell?" "Who was in charge?" Those questions, and some others, were some that I felt should have been answered because they would have helped the plot make sense.\n\n\nGameplay\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe gameplay in Transistor is different from Bastion. It's more strategic because your main ability, Turn(), freezes time and allows you to set up a number of combos and positions in order to maul your enemies to dust. Though you can also use your abilities on their own, a chain of attacks with the Transistor (the sword-like weapon our heroine, Red, wields) can clear a battlefield in seconds. Plus, if you make a mistake with your planning and have yet to initialize it, you can always go back, redo it, then unleash your power.\n\nAs always though, there's a catch: After using Turn(), there is a recharge period where most of your abilities are unavailable to you and your more often defenseless. The results of what you can do though definitely outweigh the risk. Turn() to me made the game strategic, but also fast-paced at times. You have to analyze your situation and really think instead of just rushing into battle. Planning and is a major part of the game and it's what makes it so fun.\n\nYou have four skills at your disposal, but you also have an upgrade slot to each (plus another upgrade slot that you can unlock later on), and passive skills that are always constant (a total of four you can unlock). Each of these three types slots give different effects to each skill and that, plus the the number of combinations you can set for upgrades, gives you a wide arrange of possibilities. For example, one of my favorite skills was "flash-stepping", with added bonuses of releasing balls of damaging energy along my path and a parasite that chewed away at an enemy that it homed in on. A harmless flash-step because a deadly barrage.\n\nThe difficulty of the game goes up as you go through the game and it became quite tough at times and sometimes repetative. However, I find it to be not too hardcore, but good middle ground, with easy bits at the beginning and angering parts at the end (though I'm also a fast learner and have experience in video games so it might be different for other people).\n\n\nOther\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe art style of Transistor is very similar to Bastion's. It's very well done, with great effects and cutscenes through the story. Not only that, but the music fits well throughout the game. Both of these combined create a beautiful canvas as you set up your attacks.\n\nOh yeah, there isn't really a menu. You just get thrown into the game.\n\n\nOverall\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo wrap up all this review said, Transistor has:\n+ Great main characters\n+ Great gameplay\n+ A wide variety of play styles\n+ Game mode plus\n+ Graphics/ art style\n+ Awesome music/ soundtrack\n\n- Lack of info on Cloudbank/ main setting\n- Short playthrough (if that's a bother)\n- Sometimes repetive fight scenes\n\n\nThis was definitely a fun game to play. It was just how I expected it to be and thrilled it was like that. Though somewhat short (I beat it in about 9 hours as I collected stuff and enjoyed the story), it does have a New Game Plus mode similar to Bastion's where you have all the progress from the previous game and start from the very beginning. Only thing different is that all the enemies are tougher, so you still have challenge as you fight once more through Cloudbank. I'll be definitely going through it soon.\n\nIf you're a fan of Bastion, I highly recommend that you get this game. If you like RPGs, strategy, and some fast-paced fighting, I also recommend you buy this game. Twenty bucks was definitely worth it for me and many others who preordered it as well.","May 20, 2014","true","17.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Either you go the classic active way (like any action game), or you can use the Turn() function which allows you to stop time and plan your attacks at leisure.\nWhile in Turn(), everyone freezes and a bar appears at the top of the screen, this bar represent the total of actions you can take (for those who know of it, imagine Legend of Legaia's system). Moving and attacking eats a part of the bar depending of the skill and isn't done right away, instead you plan all hte attack which will be carried out when you finish the Turn(). The actions are then done at lightning speed, often taking a number of enemies to the grave at once with good planning.\n\nAbout the skills :\nYou will equip skills (which you acquire by leveling and by finding people) at savepoint, in up to 4 active slots.\nEvery skill is totally different from another both visually and practically. One can debuff a group of enemies in an area while the other will make you invisible for a while.\nThen you can equip those skills as passives for the active skills or for yourself. A skill that makes you drop explosives packets on the ground as active will increase the damage and blast radius of another as passive. Character passives can increase your total HP, reduce damage taken, reduce cost of abilities during Turn()...\n\n\nThe game isn't too short, but not really long. It took me 7 hours to complete my first run and 9 hours to Recurse through the story. Recursion is basically New Game+ wherre you keep everything and replay the story while the enemies are end-game level and randomized through the areas.\n\nThe scenario can seem confused, but is very enjoyable with many things to learn.\nApart from the Sandbox - which give acces to a practice area and a number of tests as well as some miscellaneous stuff, a big one being the jukebox - there is no side content.\nThe art is sublime and serves very well the game. The music nicely compliments the action and events throughout the game and is a jewel to listen to.\n\nI give a solid 9.5/10 for this well crafted game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/recommended/237930/","Rhykevance","Sharisad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/","1008 products in account","A very stylish Sci-Fi Noire-ish game about a strange and somewhat utopian city, "Cloudbank", falling to an epidemic/invasion of some kind, "The Process". The protagonist, a famous musician of the city called "Red", vanishes after one of her stage acts and finds herself right in the middle of the city's demise. The game drops you into a scene with Red pulling a tool resembling an oversized sword from someone's body, which is accompanying and talking to her and which narrates many of her actions and compensates for the city having "taken" Red's voice, who herself is mostly silent. With this tool, the "Transistor", you fight your way through the declining urban environment to the source of this epidemic trying to save the city.\n\nThe game is short, but very impressive. The art design feels special and there is some pretty cool music. Cloudbank is a rather mysterious city/town, the game isn't straightforward with what world, place or time you are exactly finding yourself in. The "traces" of former certain city inhabitants absorbed by the Transistor to power your abilites while handling it in combat (fitting to their stories and roles within the city) give you hints to events predating Red's disappearance and are interesting to read - but overall the game loves leaving you in a wondering position for many parts, which (in a good, engrossing way) mystifies the whole experience and leaves room for own interpretations, possibly even for pre-/sequels or novels or other things that would build on the strong lore pieces which are there (I believe I have noticed this in the devs previous title "Bastion" to some degree too, but to my knowledge it was never worked out further, whether that is good or bad I'm not sure).\n\nLike "Bastion" this is a rather "soft" strategy action RPG in the way that you need to fight with some brains but not by being confused by millions of units and possible actions. You engage enemies with selective combat options organized at check-/savepoints, either in real-time or by utilizing a limited time-stopping/slowing planning feature. There are minor leveling elements and rather trivial but curious choices planted selectively throughout the city circling around some of its former daily routines and design questions (voting on things was popular among Cloudbank's citizens, it seems). Apparently, as a neat gimmick, the choices and a few other stats of the playerbase (like the kill count for each enemy type) are woven into this (or the game at least made me believe so). Maybe this could have been something to expend more, as it is effectively working into Cloudbank's digital and scientific ambience. You see the city through various stages of decline but without the levels building themselves up just before you (which I found somewhat irritating in Bastion), and without the "hit and run" concept of Bastion where you would often have a sanctuary to return to and select new levels to start from. This makes your journey feel a bit more like a real series of events rather than a level clearing maze, the city more persistent and you to be "actually there (as much as that is possible in this mysterious world). The narrator doesn't feel as annoying as the one in Bastion sometimes does, but maybe too distant - or even lethargic - at times. But this could be the idea of his role within the story. In general I was thankful to have him as my - or Red's - companion. However I would have loved to hear Red being properly voiced too I think. I'm not exactly the biggest fan of this "silent protagonist" concept. Here it feels rather fitting though as the whole game is strange in a good kind of way, and it allows some certain love of detail to shine more for example when Red is answering to news feeds and polls on public terminals and correcting her own sentences while being in the middle of typing them to the point where she may even give up hope for the city herself - a subtle but strong way of projecting the protagonist's emotions despite her voicelessness.\n\nThere is a little sandbox-like place in which you can practice combat and take part in some challenges. It's not as big as in Bastion, but I don't think it needs to be as it would probably only distract from the main experience. A new game will retain your level and abilites and ramp up the strength of the enemies accordingly. There are modifiers too - "limiters" - to make your enemies stronger and you level up faster, for an added challenge to whoever seeks it. That aside there doesn't seem any significant replay value, whether there are multiple endings I don't know yet. But the initial experience is an engaging and memoreable one, the game feels bold, thoughtful and determined and it's just impressive to see an apparent great vision turned so seemingly smoothly and confidently into a finished product that would very well deserve to be called a work of art.","April 11, 2015","true","19.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

They released Bastion in a time I had ceased playing video games, because I found the quantity over quality insignia that most modern games paraded to be a bit much to bear. With that one release they managed to quickly overturn my decision to abstain from video games. So let me just say (to my own fault) that I have a very soft spot for the company and the diligent employees they keep.\n\n*End Acknowledgment*\n\n- With the acknowledgment in mind, I would like to begin with the good about Transistor.\n\nThe strongest point for the whole game, in my opinion of course, is the soundtrack produced by Darren Korb. I could create a lengthy description for this, instead, I will just tell you “listen to the soundtrack”. The man is probably one of the best composers in video game culture, that is all.\n\nThe artwork of Jen Zee is a wonderful thing to behold, and deserves to be seen. This game is no exception to that. As well, as always, Logan Cunningham's voice acting is an equal treat.\n\nThe setting, world building, and most of the story are solid and deserve recognition.\n\nThese things all speak strongly for themselves and no words I can put to them will do them justice.\n\n- Now with the bad.\n\nThe battle system, while tremendously innovative, is irritating at best. I respect their attempt, but it clearly needed a great deal more work for creating a sense of balance. It contains all of the elements of strategy and turn-based RPGs that could be considered bad, without any of the rewards, progression, or smoothness. All in all, I feel that this aspect alone could have used at least another few months of consideration, if not a year, as it just feels hastily prepared and self-righteous.\n\nThe length of the game adds to the feeling of speedy preparation without consideration. Now don't get me wrong, There are some situations where a small number of episodes, or a few hours of your time can move a piece of multimedia to create a lengthy wake of contentedness. This is not one of those cases and while replay is certainly an option, I feel completely no urge to do so. They try to expand the game with a number of puzzle based battle-challenges to unlock songs within the game, but that would bring us back to the battle system.\n\nThe last of what I say rests with the story. This section contains a number of ***spoilers,*** so you should move on if you do not want this portion of the game revealed and I will post when spoilers are finished.\n\nAs a majority, the story is interesting, explorative, and at many points, compelling. There are a few points within it, however, that while I understand most probably lend themselves to a particular ideology or thematic pursuit, are what I feel to be gargantuan mistakes in not only the story of the game, but in writing as a whole.\n\nWith the exception of Royce, each and every confrontation with the Camerata was unfulfilling, if not completely vapid of context. The characters are introduced in a very dynamic scene where they murder Red's implied and nameless lover, which is roughly the most substance you are going to get from them.\n\nThe battle with Sybil is almost confusing because it feels out of place and unexplored. We do have the before mentioned cut scene, yes, but that is all we have at that point and all we get.\n\nThen we move on to Asher, and the seemingly implied arch-nemesis, Grant. Here we receive a number of communications with Asher along the way, which seem to be imploring you to garner at least a little bit of sympathy, if not just understanding for these characters. However, finally reaching them and discovering they had committed suicide, without properly introducing these supposed antagonists was (pardon my language) a ♥♥♥♥-poor story decision and shows (with evidence from the fantastic story writing in Bastion) that this was either a very unconsidered, or very lazy writing decision.\n\nI must apologize for my harshness in this respect, but I feel like I can give nothing but honesty to a company who's work I am so partial of.\n\nI must say that all of the confrontation/interaction with Royce felt incredibly well developed and was by far the most interesting part of the entire tale (with a lot of good progression leading up to it).  However, the suicide of Red not only seemed entirely uncharacteristic of a protagonist who pursued the Camerata so vigorously despite her nameless lover beckoning her not to, and who also fought so desperately to prolong her life against Royce's assail to emerge to a world she can attempt to make a better place, but it also felt like an incredibly unnecessary punch to garner some strong emotional response. At pulling on heartstrings, Red's death was certainly success, but it was at the cost of abandoning all character and story development up to this point.\n\nNow if there is an alternate ending I am unaware of, I would be willing to explore further. With things as they are though, I don't see my self playing this game again at any point in the near future.\n\n***end spoilers***\n\nI had to take a lot of time to mull over how precisely I felt overall with this game, and as much as I truly desire to give this game a thumbs up, I am needing to go with the opposing thumbs down.\n\nI do wish Supergiant a great deal of success and hope that any future releases are true gems that speak for the greatness that I know they are ultimately capable of. Also, perhaps my response to Transistor may be best summed up by the Buddhist phrase “Expectation is the root of all disappointment”.\n\nMany people are really loving this game, and I will continue to have my gamer soft-spot for Supergiant Games, but in continuing with honesty, this game needed more development and consideration for gameplay and story and I'll just have to sit-back an enjoy the soundtrack and artwork while waiting for the next release.","May 25, 2014","false","4.9"," 138 of 268 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","138","268","2","16"

Every level you get a new ability ("function") that can be an active, socketed upgrade to another ability or even a passive slot which gives you permanent ability modifiers or bonuses. And because in the lore each "function" is another citizen of Cloudbank you unlock more lore by experimenting with these abilities in different locations.

Well worth the $20 in my opinion.  If you want a detailed explanation, feel free to read and a TLDR is at the bottom.\n\nPROS:\n◘Visually pleasing to the eyes, absolutly gorgeous presentation in both animation and the enviornment.\n◘Sound design is top notch.\n◘Narration done throughout the game is fun to listen to.\n◘Can play with either mouse or keyboard.\n◘Fairly intriguing theme and story get you interested\n◘Should run fairly well on most machines.\n◘Fairly challenging as you can easily be "killed" multiple times during any battle.\n○When you "die" in combat, 2 things can happen: The first is on the brink of death you engage a emergency Turn mode (Turn is explained later below) and can fight to kill a few more enemies. The second possibility is that you "break" a function from combat for a while, and after visiting 2 (or more) Function Kiosks you can reactive them. If you break them, you are then forced to play around with your kit to experiment with new loadouts.\n◘Variety of combat with many different enemies with various different upgrade versions of them.\n◘Absolutely STELLAR combat system along with the configurations along with it (Which are detalied below)\n○As you play the game, you obtain various skills and upgrades through leveling up or finding them around the world and they are called Functions.\n○You can use these Functions in 3 ways: The first is the Active Function which you use for combat that does its base effect. The second is the Upgrade Function, where you take one of your Functions and use it to augment another Active Function, giving it special or different effect. And lastly is the Passive Function, in which you take a Function and put it into a passive state where it will always give a effect, or activate at specific under different conditions. EVERY Function in the game connects together in one way or another.\n○As you play the game, you are allowed to fight in either real time where you cast your abilities against the enemies movements and actions with no cooldown penalty, engage the Turn system to pause the game and tactically decide how you want to approach the situation. In Turn you can move almost instantly anywhere and manually aim your shots and action which are limited by a action bar. You then execute the procedure and watch your plan unfold rapidly. However, the downside to this is that once you are done with your Turn actions, you cannot use your abilities until your Turn meter has recharged. Because of these 2 systems you have a choice as to how you want to fight your battles.\n◘You can use "limiters" to further increase the difficulty of the game and gain a small amount of bonus EXP for leveling.\n◘New game plus mode with all of your stuff you unlocked.\n\n\nCONS:\n◘The UI can be just a little bit wonky with assigning Functions to various roles.\n◘Because the story is not made apparently clear at first, you can easily get lost.\n◘Turn actions that detail the effects may not always be accurate, as enemies may dodge and it doesn't tell you that information.\n◘May be just a bit short for some, as I and other have managed to beat the game at around 6 hours.\n◘Because there is new game plus and not much more, some people may not find a lot of replayability from this, resulting a 6 hour experience for $20 dollars.\n◘The only real set of graphics options are just resolutions.\n\nTLDR: Great combat, visuals and fun for ARPG fans. Can be beaten in about 6 hours, and depending on the user the new game plus can offer replayability.Can be of a bumpy ride for the first hour for people to get used to, but you get over it quickly.\n\nOverall, I feel that just about everyone should buy this beauty. The devs that made this deserve every dollar they earn and then some for the amount of effort and love that was poured into this game.","May 21, 2014","true","23.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The artwork is beautiful and the combat is challenging and fun. Dying doesn't make the fight feel unfair or impossible, it simply makes you plan your skills and tactics better for the next time. There are tests much like those found in Bastion to really test your skill which are indeed difficult, yet certainly accomplishable, and they reward you with a song for completing them that you can listen to in the game at your leisure. The boss fights in this one are actually fun too, and satisfying to complete.\nThe plot is interesting and grips you as you uncover the mystery for where everything went wrong (and there's even a reason for the *silent* protaganist! gasp!). The protagonist(s) feel alive and you genuinely care for them, hoping they can see it through to the end and make everything better. The game took about 6 hours for me to complete the first playthrough while taking my time, so it's certainly not too short but not long either.\nThe music is also very nice and fits well where it comes up, often pumping you up or feeling very haunting. My only gripe is that perhaps it is a little bit TOO similar to Bastion in the world-building and certain other aspects (though I can't blame them for it, nor do I dislike it, as Bastion's my favorite indie title.) Despite that, I honestly can't say there's anything I really  didn't  like about this game. Not a ton of replay value for those that don't fall in love with it, but the same could be said for any game. For 20 bucks it's a wonderful indie title worth experiencing. And drop 10 more for that sweet soundtrack!\n\ntl;dr: This game is challenging, beautiful, and amazing.

Similarly to their previous game, the art, story, and sound design are all fantastic. The combat is a weird hybrid between real-time and turn-based that will probably be hit-or-miss with most people. The robust skill system was incredible and is probably one of Transistor's best features.\n\nThe combat is different than most other games. You can move and attack in real time, but you'll find it difficult to survive without using the Turn() feature. Turn() pauses the game and allows you to plan out your next few movements and attacks. The planned actions will then be executed very quickly, without the enemies being able to attack or move. Turn() then goes on cooldown for a few seconds and most of your skill won't be usable. This creates a turn-like tempo in the the fights where you attack with Turn() and then play defensively when it's on cooldown.  The combat takes a little getting used to and won't be for everyone, but it really works well with the skill system.\n\nThe skill system is one of the games best features. I didn't unlock all of the skill on the first playthough, but there are at least 16 of them. Each skill can be used in 3 ways.\n1. Active Skill: The skills you use in combat. You get 4 active skill slots.\n2. Augementation: Each active slot has two augmentation slots which alter the effect of the active skill.\n3. Passive Skill: Each skill has a different passive effect when placed in one of the 4 passive slots.\n\nAlthough this seems to be overly complex, you only start with a couple skills, the 4 active slots, and an augmentation slot for each of them. You gain additional skills and slots when you level up so the game does a good job of easing you into the skill system. Furthermore, the game does an excellent job of pushing you to experiement and try new skill combinations. I had a lot of fun experimenting with the skills and trying to find effective combinations.\n\nIn conclusion, Transistor is a great game. If you liked Bastion, or are a fan of turn based RPGs, you should get this game. If you're unsure that you'll like the combat, you should look at a couple gameplay videos, but try not to spoil the story for yourself.","May 22, 2014","true","15.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The deep customization of your abilities with the various Functions(), the blend of real time frantic play with the powerful frozen planning of Turn(), and difficulty scaling done right make all the game extremely enjoyable to play. There are unbelievably powerful ability combos in the game, but you're always facing enemies that can meet the challenge. If you're not, then there's still the combat modifiers and restrictions you can add.\n\nStory-wise, the world is significantly more sparse and spare than Supergiant's previous title, Bastion, but it seems to be an intentional choice: a bit of mystery allows for varied interpretations and a long narrative shelf life, which is what I think they were going for in this game. I think they leaned a little too far in the direction of limiting information, but the game doesn't suffer for it too much.

The gameplay is a mesh of Tactical RPG and an Action RPG, There being a way to switch between real time and the planning stage makes the game go as fast as you want it to go and tailors your combat choices accordingly. The story is somewhat the games weakpoint as it is somewhat vague but very open to interpretation so it will give you some food for thought. This game is worth £30, let alone £15 and should be a must play for people who are into masterful worlds and and rich gameplay.

He starts off being very misterious and then (almost forcibly) changes, similar to a drunk man confessing his feelings (but considering how and when it happens thi analogy is perfect), but he find liberation in his stupor and completes his as a character (nearly). I didnt like him that much, since I expected him to be something else, but I can see some of myself in him, even though I dont like it.\n\nEnemies are awesome, the main antagonist(s) are interesting, they have motives and drives, they arent EVIL in the traditional sense of the word, but they are aganst Red (protagonist, ergo, you). You want to find out about more about them.\n\nGameplay and story are fused and work and play well together, its rewards you. Skill and upgrade system is nothing like I have ever seen, and is a breath of fresh air, it limites yoou in a way to make most of what you have and the way you want to play. I hope I see something like that in another game.\n\nStory is tightly knit, it has its path and follows it, there is no clutter or bloat to spread the hours. It gives you a great satisfaction to learn more and explore the world that is before you.\n\nMusic is amazing! That is all, I am listening to it right now.\n\nIs this more of the Bastion type game? Yes, BUT this just proves there is more ways to skin a cat,  you can see Bastions influence, but only in very very general sense, as you play and imerse yourself you see that Transistor is just a sister to Beastion, related, yes, but completely separate person.\n\nJust, buy and play it.

It is hard to find something like that in a linear game such as this.\n-The art. Holy ♥♥♥♥, man. I was enthralled when I played Bastion because of the craftsmanship that went into every little detail, but this game was on a whole other level.\n-THE MUSIC. Bastions music, which was conducted by Darren Korb, was flawless. When I saw the preview for this game at E3 last year and heard "We All Become" I knew that Supergiant Games and Darren Korb would not dissapoint me with this title. And guess what: They ♥♥♥♥ing didn't\n-All the little things. The narration of the Transistor throughout the game, the fact that you can have the protagonist hum along to the soundtrack, etc.\n-Last but definitely not least: the characters. For a silent protagonist, Red found a way into my heart very fast. The relationship between Red and The Transistor was beautiful. Simple, yet complicated.\n\nI am honestly so happy that I played this game. Absolute 10/10.\n","June 29, 2014","true","18.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Transistor did not disapoint.  The fighting style was unique and interesting because you had to combine moves together to make them more powerful and give unique secondary abilities based on which ones you combined.  I was also surprised to find that I didn't stick with one set of moves the whole time. Transistor did a good job of making abilities good in some situations and bad in others.  It became very strategic once you got more moves and it was a lot of fun.\n\nBut by far the BEST part about Transistor was the music and art.  Bastion was one of my favorite games not because the gameplay was the something I had never seen before, but that game was a paradise for your eyes and ears.  I always thought Bastion had the best soundtrack in a videogame but after playing Transistor I was blown away. The vocals for the songs are by the same person who sang "Build that Wall", (Ashley Barrett) except in this game you get to hear the full potential of her voice, and let me tell you, it is the best voice I have ever heard.  It fits the tone of the game really well.  The art in this game is also amazing. Particularly the colors and overall style was what really looked great.  This game also does a great job of making the story interesting by making you figure out what it is based on clues it gives you throughout the game.  In fact one of my favorite aspects was reading through character files looking for clues on what was going on.\n\nMy only complaints about this game kind of negate each other.  What I mean is, I took the game quite slow, and I still finished it in 7 hours, which with how much I enjoyed it seemed short.  On the other hand, the combat system was starting to get a little repetative so I don't know that I would have wanted it to go much longer.\n\nOverall I loved this game, and with the very interesting story, amazing music, and incredible art, I felt like it almost should have been a movie instead of a videogame for how beautiful it was. 9/10","June 1, 2014","true","8.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

You have to connect the dots yourself to come up with the whole story. It's very similar to an anime called "Serial Experiments Lain" in that sense. The whole game challenges and treats the player as someone who has enough intellect to fully grasp and learn the gameplay by himself. It mixes action rpg with turn-based strategy. I didn't like it so much, but I guess that's just a matter of preference.\nThe ending is shocking, but makes a lot of sense given the context.\n\nHowever, despite me highly recommending the game it is indeed very short.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hunter64/recommended/237930/","Hunter64","Hunter64","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hunter64/","366 products in account","Transistor and the Studio's previous title Bastion, have some similarities. I may refer to Bastion for some notes, however to avoid confusing those who haven't played Bastion, I will refrain from mentioning it if possible.\n\nFor the short version of this review:\n+ Absolutely fantastic art style, which can be seen in the environments, as well as enemy designs and your own character.\n+ Beautiful soundtrack, still listening to it now. Most of the songs (if not all of them) have been uploaded to Supergiant's official youtube page to listen to.\n+ Narration has plenty of dialogue for optional parts of the game, as well as lines during combat.\n+ Planning takes the center stage in combat. Transistor mode allows you to stop time, to set out some orders and execute them.\n+ 10+ abilities you can select from, all with interesting combinations to try out.\n+ NG+ brings stronger enemies and some new lines of dialogue to your second playthrough\n- The game is pretty short, I only got about 8 hours from the first playthrough.\n- Not the most challenging game, but it can become difficult if you add in 'limiters' in the form of extra difficulty options.\n- Frequent freezing if you've been playing for a few hours at a time, including during combat. I've heard of crashes, but haven't experienced them myself yet.\n+/- PC controls are pretty good, but may require you to get adjusted.\n+/- Story leaves a lot to personal interpretation, while some solid conclusion is given, some may not be content with what is there.\n\nNow for the details.\n\nStory\nThis is a bit touchy, as I feel most of the story is really revealed in the second half of the game, or at the end, so I won't go into to much detail. At the start of the game, you're introduced as, Red a famous singer who has lost her voice and her friend to a strange group of individuals. Your friend's mind is thrown into a sword, the Transistor, which is the only weapon you'll use through the entire Journey. You begin following the only trail you have, seeking answers. Why you? What is their end goal? What is happening to the city? As your progress, you'll get your answers, and you'll watch as the world around you changes. Will you be truly satisfied with these answers though?\n\nEnivornments and Art Style\nThis is mostly subjective I suppose. However the art style present feels unique, or at least like a mix of other influencing styles. The blend of realistic environments with this strange cyber-esque world creates a very surreal feeling to the world, which is only further added to by the art style. Enemies encountered called 'processes' are very machine like in nature.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe soundtrack is an interesting mix of genres, with Darren Korb's personal spin on all of them. Individual songs vary quite a bit. Some songs are very dramatic vocal heavy pieces, that will have you just gushing over the singer's fantastic voice. Other's will get you deeply rooted into the atmosphere, providing a great backdrop for walking around the interesting enviroments. There is of course, good combat music as well. I'm still listening to the sound track, as I write this review actually.\n\nNarration\nThis is where the mention of Bastion has to come in. Bastion (as most of you likely know) had a great narration system, which had an interesting personality narrate your actions throughout the game, highlighting key moments. Transistor uses the same voice actor, for a slightly different system. Instead the narrator, is an actual character, or rather your sword. That's right your sword talks to you throughout the game. He will comment on specific spots and regions, his thoughts and opinions. Sarcastic remarks are thrown around as well occasionally. In combat he will make comments based on your actions, such as when you execute a turn, or if you lose too much health.\n\nWhile this is personal taste, I find this style of 'narration' much more interesting than Bastion's narration. In Bastion, it seemed as if he was just telling the story of the protagonist, maybe even to someone else. In Transistor, he plays a character, he frequently talks to Red, not some ambiguous audience. This adds some personality to both Red and the Transistor. As he spoke throughout the game I grew an attachment to him, and a level of appreciation. Red and the Transistor also seem to grow together throughout the game, even if they are only small subtle ques. I suppose this is a bit hard to convey though, as Red can't speak.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is relatively simple at first, you have four abilities at your disposal, that can be activated with the right click and aimed with the mouse. You move with ASWD or left mouse click. It gets a little more interesting when the Transistor mode is brought in. Transistor mode allows you to stop time to move and use your abilites to plan your attack, and then execute it. Then of course, there's a cooldown between turns. This is probably the meat of the combat, more options besides your four abilites will open up to be used in interesting ways.\n\nYour four abilities have one initial modifier slot. These modifier slots obviously modify the ability, using other abilites. For example, Crash can be modified with Jaunt to be usable inbetween turns. Or you can combine Ping with Crash to proc mini-stuns on your target. Eventually you can unlock two modifier slots for your abilities which will introduce more options. Such as a Crash that splits into three projectiles and explodes on impact. Keep in mind there are about 10 abilities, so the combinations can get a bit crazy. This however, makes it all the more fun.\n\nOverall:\nIt's a fantastic game with plenty to offer in terms of execution and style, but it feels lacking in the amount of content it has to deliver. It may be a normal length singleplayer game (by today's standards), it still doesn't offer a large quantity. However the quality debatably makes up for the short length. For some, this will leave a lasting impression, an experience you won't forget. One that has such a unique combat system, combined with a beautiful soundtrack, art style, and presentation. If you don't care for that stuff however, this game might not be your sort of thing. Don't expect an open world sandbox experience.\n\nFinal Rating: 7.5 / 10","May 21, 2014","true","10.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Click here for my full review.[www.thatvideogameblog.com]\n\nTransistor is easily my game of the year, and one of my favourite RPGs of all time. Over time I've looked back at the experience and I've come to the conclusion that, of all the games I've played in the past fifteen years or so, Transistor may just be the best out of all them. I ended up clocking in at around thirteen hours, but that includes the time in which it was alt tabbed to write my review. In created few hours, I played one of the most complete, engaging, immersive and beautiful games ever made. Without a shadow of a doubt, Transistor is a masterpiece.\n\nMechanically, it plays out like an isometric RPG in the vein of Fallout, but with real-time elements and less skills to upgrade. The end result is a very smooth combat experience that still has a heavy emphasis on strategy without ever being overbearing or overcomplicated. Players use the Turn system to pause the game, queue up a series of attacks, and execute them. Once this is done, they will have to wait a short while before pausing the game, forcing them to play in real time, which more often than not means running for cover and re-positioning yourself as your enemies go on the offensive.\n\nTransistor makes up for its short length with mechanical depth. Each skill or "Function" can be used in one of three ways. First, they can be used as an active skill to defeat enemies in combat. Second, they can be used as upgrades to the aforementioned active skills. Finally, they can be used in a passive slot, with each granting you a unique ability. This system allows for a wide variety of distinct playstyles, which adds immense replayibility and variety to an already hugely enjoyable action roleplaying experience.\n\nAs the icing on the cake, each Function corresponds to a person in the city of Cloudbank, the setting of the game. Using your skills in a variety of ways unlocks lore titbits that detail the backstory and fates of the world's denizens, allowing you to piece most of the story together yourself. Not only does this encourage players to experiment with as many different loadouts as they can, it also gives players a simple way to slowly uncover the game's lore without feeling as though the narrative is being crammed down their throat. In fact, much of Transistor's narrative is told this way.\n\nMuch like BioShock, Transistor features a utopian city that has seen much better days, the backstory for which is slowly revealed through dialogue and narration sprinkled throughout the campaign. The story is always subtle and never ham-fisted. Most of the plot is delivered by the Transistor itself - voiced by the brilliant Logan Cunningham - the talking sword you'll be using to cut a swath through the Process, the primary antagonistic force you'll be fighting.\n\nFighting the Process is as hard as you want it be. It never feels like it's being padded out unnecessarily, and offers additional challenge in the form of "limits". Limits add rules to the game such as enemies dealing more damage and having to be hit once before collecting their cells which, if not collected, will respawn the enemy. Brilliantly, using these will also reveal additional lore and grant the player extra experience points, which can be used to unlock new skills and upgrades.\n\nLosing all of your health doesn't mean dying either. If your HP hits zero, your most expensive skill will become overloaded and unavailable to you until you visit two more access points - the terminals at which the player can change their loadout. This is an elegant solution that keeps the action flowing, whilst still discouraging players from screwing up, and pushing them to try different tactics if what they're currently doing isn't working without constantly taking them out of the experience.\n\nAll of this, and I haven't even mentioned how beautiful the game looks. It's beautiful. Seriously, it's Jen Zee. You can see the screenshots, you know incredible it looks, and no amount of words will do Zee's work justice. The game sounds just as magnificent as it looks, featuring the talents of Darren Korb and Ashley Barrett, who have created a soundtrack as soothing as it blood-pumping. You see that original soundtrack for sale up there? Buy it.\n\nThere's not much else I can say about Transistor, except that feels like the most complete and well-polished experience I've ever had the sheer joy of playing. It's a near-perfect and complete work of art, one that easily earns every cent of your money and second of your time.","August 1, 2014","true","33.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Ending was a bit disappointing, and it felt way too linear compared to the first one. For the positives, really nice way of having the combat.\nYou can choose between either action styled combat similar to what Bastion had, or a more strategy focused approach, which in a way was similar to Frozen Synapse. Also they kept the artstyle similar to Bastion, but improved a lot on it as well.\nNew to this game is also a really nice flexible ability system, where you can decide to use your new weapons as weapons, additions to old weapons or as passive abilities. This makes it so that you have seemingly endless options when it comes to your playstyle.\n\nIn my opinion no characters aside from the main character were noteworthy, which is kind of a shame, since that contributed a lot to Bastion's atmosphere.\nI shouldn't really be comparing it this much to Bastion, as they aren't directly related to each other, but I think a lot of people wanting to buy this is because they want it to be a similar experience.\nAs a conclusion I'd recommend this game to everyone who liked Bastion, but it doesn't quite live up to the expectations (storywise) I had after playing the first one.","May 21, 2014","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The amount of detail in the areas that you don't even spend much time in is incredible. Hard to really say much more about it... it's a very unique style, similar in many ways to Bastion, but  more squared townsquare types of areas as opposed to the more natural style of Bastion (which was less angles, more curves.)\n\nJust like Bastion, the soundtrack is perfect and fits so well. It's something you can listen to outside of game and still be pleased.\n\nThe story is delivered via dialogue and in-game text via computer terminals. The story is ok, but is just incredibly shallow and vague. Character motives are never really explained, it just feels like there were a few events that were described or implied, and you just have to go, "oh okay." It seems like a very small episode of a much larger story.\n\nThe game play itself is actually fairly challenging and consists of a mixture of real-time combat and turn-based combat. Enemies appear on screen and you can attack them, but more often than not there are many of them, they're fast and disruptive. The turn-based combat is a mode you enter into, then you get to plan out your moves and attacks before having them execute in slow-motion. It's really satisfying, but is manadatory through the majority of the second half of the game. You just take way too much unavoidable damage otherwise.\n\nThe enemies themselves actually feel fairly frustrating a lot of the time. There are certain units you REALLY have to priortize, otherwise you just won't win the fights. While priortizing those targets, you're pretty much getting attacked by all the others. Later on in the game these mechanics are less strategic and just more frustrating. There is also not much variety in the enemies... so the encounters end up being X amount of these guys, Y amounts of these guys, fight. Kind of lame, as it removes some depth and strategy that could come from complex fight scenarios, and instead goes for "just throw more guys at him."\n\nAttacks are called functions, an you unlock many, but can only equip 4 of them. The extras can be socketed into your 4 main functions to upgrade them (additional effects), or as passives that activate based on certain conditions. There's a lot of variety here, and different abilities work better in certain situations than others.\n\nIf you lose all your health in combat, instead of dying one of your functions gets overloaded and you have to continue on fighting without it. I'm pretty sure the function that gets overloaded was the last one you used prior to "death", but not 100% sure. This cycle continues until you run out of functions completely I suspect (I never had this happen though.) It's a nice way of lessening the chances of you getting stuck and not being able to get by to continue the game... which is good because sometimes you get really unlucky in a fight and it prevents you from feeling like the game hates you as much. Functions become useable again after you access a couple of switcher terminal things later on in the levels, so until then you pretty much have to swap them out with other functions or go on without 4 functions.\n\nOverall, I think this game was pretty enjoyable. It has a very high level of thought and polish put into it. The combat system is incredibly good, but the combat scenarios are weak and frustrating at times. The game doesn't necessarily feel "fun" to play, which is the same gripe I had with Bastion, but that doesn't mean it wasn't enjoyable or not worth a playthrough. I think this mainly stems from both these games not really having "low" or "bad" points that make the great points stand out.\n\nThe game is also incredibly short... I beat it in ~5 hours according to steam, and I tried to interact with as much as I could find. This is probably the biggest "issue" with it... it just ends up sort of unfulfilling. It does however have a New Game + mode, so you can continue to level and unlock more things, as well as a lot of "challenge" levels where you can hone your skills. I think this game should have had more hands working on it, in order to really make the scope much larger in terms of gameplay and story. There is absolutely no filler in the game which is good, but like I said earlier in the review, it feels like an episode of something much bigger.... so huge amounts of potential left unexplored. Still, the amount of time, effort and detail that went into this game is really apparent in every way imaginable. For what it's worth, if you've played neither of these games, I'd highly recommend playing Bastion before this.","June 7, 2014","true","5.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Turn() adds a lot of strategy to something that could very well have been just another normal hack and slash game.\n-The customization of The Transistor that allowed for every program you get in the game to either be used as an active skill, an upgrade to a skill, or simply a passive skill for your character, leaves infinite possibilites for customization. It is hard to find something like that in a linear game such as this.\n-The art. Holy ♥♥♥♥, man. I was enthralled when I played Bastion because of the craftsmanship that went into every little detail, but this game was on a whole other level.\n-THE MUSIC. Bastions music, which was conducted by Darren Korb, was flawless. When I saw the preview for this game at E3 last year and heard "We All Become" I knew that Supergiant Games and Darren Korb would not dissapoint me with this title. And guess what: They ♥♥♥♥ing didn't\n-All the little things. The narration of the Transistor throughout the game, the fact that you can have the protagonist hum along to the soundtrack, etc.\n-Last but definitely not least: the characters. For a silent protagonist, Red found a way into my heart very fast. The relationship between Red and The Transistor was beautiful. Simple, yet complicated.\n\nI am honestly so happy that I played this game. Absolute 10/10.\n","June 29, 2014","true","18.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Transistor did not disapoint.  The fighting style was unique and interesting because you had to combine moves together to make them more powerful and give unique secondary abilities based on which ones you combined.  I was also surprised to find that I didn't stick with one set of moves the whole time. Transistor did a good job of making abilities good in some situations and bad in others.  It became very strategic once you got more moves and it was a lot of fun.\n\nBut by far the BEST part about Transistor was the music and art.  Bastion was one of my favorite games not because the gameplay was the something I had never seen before, but that game was a paradise for your eyes and ears.  I always thought Bastion had the best soundtrack in a videogame but after playing Transistor I was blown away. The vocals for the songs are by the same person who sang "Build that Wall", (Ashley Barrett) except in this game you get to hear the full potential of her voice, and let me tell you, it is the best voice I have ever heard.  It fits the tone of the game really well.  The art in this game is also amazing. Particularly the colors and overall style was what really looked great.  This game also does a great job of making the story interesting by making you figure out what it is based on clues it gives you throughout the game.  In fact one of my favorite aspects was reading through character files looking for clues on what was going on.\n\nMy only complaints about this game kind of negate each other.  What I mean is, I took the game quite slow, and I still finished it in 7 hours, which with how much I enjoyed it seemed short.  On the other hand, the combat system was starting to get a little repetative so I don't know that I would have wanted it to go much longer.\n\nOverall I loved this game, and with the very interesting story, amazing music, and incredible art, I felt like it almost should have been a movie instead of a videogame for how beautiful it was. 9/10","June 1, 2014","true","8.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Supergiant play to their strengths, which is an isometric 3d world with beautiul art, a sweet soundtrack and a narrator that narrates everything about you in a nice rich voice.\n\nThe problem I have with it is largely that, though. Supergiant stuck to their strengths and did not really push much of any boundaries, and it wasn't really that novel; Bastion 2.0, really.\n\nThe main innovation is in the combat system, which I do sorta like - hate having to use Turn(), love how all your attacks work as primary attacks, upgrade modules or passive items. I also like the semi-online aspect, where you can see ghosts of other people, a'la Dark Souls. (At least, I'm pretty sure they are, and I'm sure the numerous polls you use are actually being formed by other players voting as well)\n\nOne bug I had, which wasn't fatal, but severely annoying in that my game randomly locks up for maybe 3 seconds when I do things like attack.\n\nWorth buying -- if you've played Bastion, though, might want to wait until it's like $15 or cheaper instead of the full $20, because they feel like the same game almost.","May 21, 2014","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

Adding difficulty this way gives bonus exp.\n- Has checkpoints that allow you to change your loadout almost every 2-3 minutes.\n\nBad/not as good:\n- Took me 4 hours to beat, could have been a little longer, but wasn't needed.

Not sure what they could have done to make this better though, since I found the combat system really enjoyable.\n- Some of the lore is locked behind your combat abilities, and this lore is unlocked by using the abilities as just a normal ability, as an upgrade to an existing ability, or as a passive bonus.

I was afraid of this before the release but it turned out to be just amazingly done making you want to use both and blend them together.\nSkill/Functions/Character development is innovative and give you a lot, and I mean A LOT of different possible builds and the game itself/story development does a great job on encouraging you to switch your tactics as often as you can.\n\nAlthough. After finishing I think, that I liked Bastion a little bit better. Probably because it was first and it was a surprise.

It excels on many levels, and has definitely become one of my favorite games up to date.\n\nThe story of Red, a singer gone mute, and her companion sword, the Transistor, is told with just the right amount of ambiguity and subtle cues. Decidedly leaving some questions open while you play, Transistor invites you to piece it together yourself - the little hints regarding Red's background and how she ended up on her own are stunning to put together. Paced just right, it is truly a unique experience for the player.\n\nThe gameplay, too, is quite fun. The mixture between turn-based strategy and action helps the player to find their own rhythm - a rapid, high-risk approach, or a carefully planned out attack: It is up to the player. Furthermore, the RPG elements of this game are very entertaining. Even though I found myself very comfortable with a certain set of functions early on, the game encouraged me to try out new combinations both through story and challenge incentives. I have to say that I am glad that they did, for I've long left my original set behind. And now with New Game+, one can explore even more of its versatility!\n\nAnd of course, Transistor stands out as a visually stunning, and audibly well told tale that was to be expected from Supergiant Games. Like Bastion, all assets have the beautiful 2D quality to them, and take it to the next level. Jen Zee's art direction is impeccable and truly comes to shine in this beautiful game. Darren Korb's soundtrack complements the visual side of it with a  jazzy and relaxed style, truly emphasizing the artwork of the game.\n\nTransistor is a game that every gamer should have in their library.

Did all the challenge arenas (That were available to me, not sure why one or two end ones were locked in the final scene.).  Read a decent amount, all the terminals I saw, but passed some of the character bios on the Function() screens.\n\nCalmly playing through, listening to the story, "exploring" what few detours there were, and it's a 6-7 hour game in a playthrough.\n\nThough, the game's narration didn't grab me the same as Bastion's did, and a good half to 3/4ths of the story is in the text.  It was a tad shorter than I expected for a first run-down.  But the combat did make up for it, while interesting to tackle, there's a myriad of combinations that only get more interesting down the line.   NG+ might be worth it to many, and I might dabble in it later on, but it's not something I'll mention as a way to extend what is a story-driven game for later playthroughs.\n\nOverall, I'm not disappointed with my $20.  I would recommend others who aren't dying for the game or just HAVE to play something new right now to wait until it's in the $10-15 bracket. Give or take if you get the soundtrack with it.

I am not sure if it was related to the fact that I was running on a Crossfire setup, just throwing it out there as a warning in case someone else encounters it to.","August 1, 2014","true","12.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Ending was a bit disappointing, and it felt way too linear compared to the first one. For the positives, really nice way of having the combat.\nYou can choose between either action styled combat similar to what Bastion had, or a more strategy focused approach, which in a way was similar to Frozen Synapse. Also they kept the artstyle similar to Bastion, but improved a lot on it as well.\nNew to this game is also a really nice flexible ability system, where you can decide to use your new weapons as weapons, additions to old weapons or as passive abilities. This makes it so that you have seemingly endless options when it comes to your playstyle.\n\nIn my opinion no characters aside from the main character were noteworthy, which is kind of a shame, since that contributed a lot to Bastion's atmosphere.\nI shouldn't really be comparing it this much to Bastion, as they aren't directly related to each other, but I think a lot of people wanting to buy this is because they want it to be a similar experience.\nAs a conclusion I'd recommend this game to everyone who liked Bastion, but it doesn't quite live up to the expectations (storywise) I had after playing the first one.","May 21, 2014","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game looks, plays, and sounds like nothing else out there, and, even more impressively, exexuctes nearly all of these innovative ideas to perfection. The best game of 2014 so far.\n\nPros:\n\n- The combat. It's a hybrid of turn based strategy and arena action a la Bastion. The standard mode allows free movement and usage of up to 4 equppied abilities (mostly) without cooldown. Pressing space initiates Turn(), which allows you to expend a set number of action points to move and perform abilities at hundreds of times the speed of the standard mode. Turn()'s cooldown length varies based the percentage of action points you used, and all abilities are locked while these points regenerate. Its a brilliant system made more so by the enemy design that forces you to quickly and strategically switch between the two modes.\n\n- The customization. Every ability is a function that can be equipped as an active ability, a passive ability, or overload an active ability with additional functionality. Additional memory and slots to equip functions unlock as the game progresses, allowing for a staggering number of highly unique loadouts. This system allows for nearly any playstyle imaginable to be viable. Using a method in one of its three roles unlock additional backstory material, strongly encouraging experimentation without ever forcing anything. Losing all health in a battle temporarily locks an ability each time it happens, further encouraging creative loadouts while waiting for the locked ability to restore.\n\n- Tests and limiters. The game features 23 tests (and additional Access tests available only on a second playthrough) of your ability to use Turn(), to survive unwinnable situations, to clear enemies with only select functions available, and your speed in standard combat. The majority of these tests are very well designed and often very challenging. All are entirely optional and unlock tracks for the music player. Similarly, limiters are fully optional abilities unlocked at various points in the story that can be equipped to increase the challenge and XP gain of combat. They're a clever way to provide and reward customizable difficulty.\n\n- The art and music. The screenshots and videos on the store page really don't do it justice. Transistor is one of the best looking and sounding games ever made.\n\n- The story. Like Bastion, the critical parts of the story are delivered largely through narration. Unlike Bastion, the non-critical majority of the story is found in terminals, function descriptors, and view points that are all fully optional and found only through exploration. All of it is interesting, well written, and best left to experience on your own.\n\n- New game+. Transistor calls NG+ "Recurse." This allows you to play through the game again with all of your abilities and limiters from before. Enemies also retain their abilities, however. Recurse also provides access to higher player levels and additional tests that are not unlockable in a single playthrough.\n\nCons\n\n- Some of the dialogue is a bit weak.\n\nNotes:\n\n- The story is much better than it gets credit for. That said, it's much more abstract that what you usually see in games. There's a good chance you won't like it if you're looking for a story that gives every question a clear resolution. This applies especially to the ending.\n\n- The game is about 5 hours long on first playthrough. Recurse can likely double that. I think it's good enough to justify a $2-$4 an hour price tag. If you don't, wait for a sale.\n\n- Although by no means necessary, some basic knowledge of programming terms will likely make the game more slightly more interesting. It's entertaining to see how some terms were turned into combat abilities, and knowing what a few mean in reality will add a bit to the story. None of it is essential for understanding.","July 7, 2014","true","5.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The narrative pulled me along - and the world never lost it's curious nature. I found myself wanting to know what was next every moment I played. Something unique about transistor personally, for me. I haven't seen many games that pulled me a long the way it had.\n\nFrom an Artists perspective - may I just say this game is gorgeous. It's truly beautiful. I tried to savor every single location because of it. The immense use of color and vibrancy in some areas is literally awe inspiring. The designers and Artists who put their time into this game must have really enjoyed the whole process - because I can't fathom anything of this quality being made without considerable love and devotion to it.\n\nGameplaywise? This game was challenging and fun. The way combat worked was unique to itself - and I enjoyed how much customization your abilities had. It's honestly impressive and fun to sit there figuring out how to build a character. I found myself drawn to a combination of summoning my pet luna and using her in conjunction with other control abilities. But there were so many different ways to go about this.\n\nThe soundtrack, well.. how else can I put it? I'd have bought this if it were just /music/ it is so wonderful. But the narrative it flows along with can't be put to the side, either. The narrative the game follows gives quite a few on the songs an amazing meaning to the lyrics and themes - I enjoyed listening to each song and seeing how it told things the story hadn't quite covered.\n\nThe story - my god the story. I'm not the toughest guy in the world, but I sure as hell don't cry over nothing. Without revealing too much, let me tell you the person who made this game's story was a genius. It's so beautiful on so many levels. I pride myself on the ability to take something away from a game's meaning and message - and this is a game that has a beautiful message at it's heart.\n\nIf I had to say one thing about the ending, I would say it was exactly what I wanted - but not what I had expected whatsoever. You are always on your toes during the whole experience - you never quite see where it's going - and that's the most amazing thing I've ever experienced in a game of 2014. I reccomend this to all of my friends - and pretty much the whole gaming community.\n\nThis is something you don't want to miss. It's truly something that won't be forgotten. 10/10","November 2, 2014","true","9.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay is a mesh of Tactical RPG and an Action RPG, There being a way to switch between real time and the planning stage makes the game go as fast as you want it to go and tailors your combat choices accordingly. The story is somewhat the games weakpoint as it is somewhat vague but very open to interpretation so it will give you some food for thought. This game is worth £30, let alone £15 and should be a must play for people who are into masterful worlds and and rich gameplay. My only complaint would be that the game is a bit on the short side but that is fixed by new game plus letting you keeping all your upgrades and functions while starting from the beginning of the game again. Transistor is a enjoyable albeit short experience that I can recommend to anyone.","July 4, 2014","true","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Another unique world elegantly crafted by Supergiant Games, very interesting gameplay I loved to tinker with and another OST that suplemented the atmosphere of the world of Transistor.\n\n>>> I WILL NOT TO SPOIL ANYTHING, things will be clear after the fact, I really like this developer and I want to support >>> them in their indeavors, since they are doing something new and interesting.\n\nMain character Red, is strong, resilient, and graceful, even though silent trough out the game (like in Bastion), trough her (players) actions becomes adamant in her mission.\n\nThe male chacater (also the narator) is someone who doesnt want be THE hero, but HER hero, he has great Hero Complex issues. He starts off being very misterious and then (almost forcibly) changes, similar to a drunk man confessing his feelings (but considering how and when it happens thi analogy is perfect), but he find liberation in his stupor and completes his as a character (nearly). I didnt like him that much, since I expected him to be something else, but I can see some of myself in him, even though I dont like it.\n\nEnemies are awesome, the main antagonist(s) are interesting, they have motives and drives, they arent EVIL in the traditional sense of the word, but they are aganst Red (protagonist, ergo, you). You want to find out about more about them.\n\nGameplay and story are fused and work and play well together, its rewards you. Skill and upgrade system is nothing like I have ever seen, and is a breath of fresh air, it limites yoou in a way to make most of what you have and the way you want to play. I hope I see something like that in another game.\n\nStory is tightly knit, it has its path and follows it, there is no clutter or bloat to spread the hours. It gives you a great satisfaction to learn more and explore the world that is before you.\n\nMusic is amazing! That is all, I am listening to it right now.\n\nIs this more of the Bastion type game? Yes, BUT this just proves there is more ways to skin a cat,  you can see Bastions influence, but only in very very general sense, as you play and imerse yourself you see that Transistor is just a sister to Beastion, related, yes, but completely separate person.\n\nJust, buy and play it. Be happy.","November 24, 2014","true","5.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Alanza/recommended/237930/","Alanza","Alazna","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Alanza/","30 products in account","It's hard to describe this game without using the word "beautiful" at least several hundred times, along with other adjectives, such as "amazing", "addicting", and "magnificent". I'm shocked how some people don't realize its true intentions as rather a story you are thrown into to experience first hand. I'll try to explain this further with no spoilers:\n\nThe beginning throws you straight into the game; no main menu, no background story, nothing. I had to YouTube the game just to make sure I hadn't accidently skipped an intro cutscene, but sure enough, what I was seeing was the way it was intended to begin. Already, I was impressed.\n\nGameplay felt comfortable. No stretching my tiny, feminine fingers out to reach oddly specific keys. Mouse controls were smooth and responsive. I never had a problem getting stuck on anything or walking into walls. My first time playing through I obviously relied on the Turn() aspect of the combat quite a bit, but towards the end and on my second time around, I realized the benefits of using both styles of combat, using the real time more for specific enemies that either evaded the effects of Turn() or were not of importance to waste it on. The key feature of applying Functions as a normal active function, an upgrade, or a passive stat was genius and allows for any person's unique fighting strategies. With how flexible the combat is, I'm surprised people have complaints about it.\n\nThe characters and dialogue of the entire game were enthralling and immersive. I felt highly connected with Red's character, and knew so much about her despite her ailment. That never stopped her character from shining through. Her sassy yet proper attitude was visible in her actions, not to mention how weak and afraid she truly was. She didn't have the amazing super strength to lift such a giant sword all the time. It would constantly dragged behind her, but she would gather her little strength to unleash amazing attacks, usually having to lift herself and the sword back up off the ground afterwards. She was constantly playing with her hair and adjusting herself, but obviously was not too absorbed in her looks, seeing that she tore such a beautiful ball gown to shreds for the sake of being able to run. Mr. Nobody, as he titles himself at an early point and what I prefer to call him since, no, he is not the Transistor itself, still shines through despite not even having a body. His voice acting is absolutely amazing. Every word meant something. Some lines made tears well up in my eyes. He had attitude as well, much more sarcastic and joking, but he was just as believable as Red.\n\nThe story, while I won't say much, was just beautiful. It's never what you expect, but not hard to follow along with. I will say the trailer gives false ideas and practically lies about the true story. Playing this blind is an amazing experience. Do me a favor and when Mr. Nobody starts talking, don't cut him off. Let him speak. All the dialogue means something in the story and if you cut him off, you could lose so much of the true story and not understand things in the future. A lot of playthroughs on YouTube do this. Don't cut off the experience for yourself. Take the extra time to sit there and just listen.\n\nThe music is just fantastic, and the little hum you can play for each track gives it a new spin and practically makes it a different song. All the music is addicting and plays perfectly along side the gameplay. The music is mellow and slow, so you never feel rushed in a battle, making the combat feel smooth and relaxed rather than frantic. The music is meant to calm you in the fray of battle and does so quite well. The art speaks for itself. Even if you hate the game, you can't deny its beauty. Everything looks hand painted. The 3D models are high definition, to the point where Red's facial expressions are visible. I'm simply obsessed with the artistic style they chose.\n\nFinal boss and ending sequence brought me to tears. I sobbed like a little girl, but for good reason, so don't judge. I had been near tears for most of the game due to its music and voice acting and the end pulled the final strings to my heart. It has been a very long time since a game has done this for me. I will ask you all again something here; if you beat it, when it asks you to play the recursion, at least watch the intro again. If the slight secret difference in the intro does not compel you to play more, than I'm not sure what will.\n\nTo be blunt, I'm kind of an expert on this game. I've been tracking it since its announcement at E3, watched all the demos and trailers, received it on the release day, have the soundtrack on my phone, and at the time of posting this I have racked up about 14 hours on the game. I will say if you're expecting a casual game of the typical demographic of 13-17 year old boys, this has no time for you. This game requires patience, attention, and heart. It is not the game's fault if you do not feel the need to provide it with these then seek to trash it for "not being good enough". Before you judge it, follow my suggestion of listening to all the dialogue and at least attempt to finish it. The game should take someone who is not rushed about 10 hours; not long at all. This game is a story and an experience, not something you can mindlessly blow through.\n\nMy final rating is 10/10, simply because it brought me to tears not once, not twice, but three times, and I'll happily cry again just to play through it once more to immerse myself in its beautiful story.","May 25, 2014","true","20.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tempurawizard/recommended/237930/","tempurawizard","fragranthills","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tempurawizard/","258 products in account","Just a great game all-around.\n\nMost everybody that's interested in this game will be comparing it to Bastion, so we'll go with that metric.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Transistor is quite different than Bastion.  Yes, they're both top-down hack-and-slashes at heart, but while Bastion's beating heart lies squarely in twitch/dodge/attack mechanics, Transistor is a more contemplative experience with its Turn() system.  In fact, the grand majority of Transistor ends up playing much more like a tactics game than a hack-and-slash game; use of skills outside of Turn() is limited and you'll spend most of your time outside of Turn() playing keep-away.  Some people may find this a downgrade, but if you're the sort of person that enjoyed Bastion and also logged hundered-hour files in tactical RPG games (myself included) you'll find yourself comfortable in the world of Transistor.\n\nIn terms of style, Transistor is very much cut from the same cloth as Bastion.  That's to be expected when Bastion was such a beautiful and lovingly crafted game.  Painterly visuals abound, and Darren Korb (music) and Logan Cunningham (primary voice actor) are both back in top form, as I'm sure everyone not living in a cave is aware.  Come for the audio-visual niravana, stay for the gameplay.\n\nAs far as criticisms are concerned, stability of the game is still a bit lower than could be desired at this point; I had to play around with the files of the game to overcome the dreaded startup crash bug that many people have been complaining of.  A minor criticisim:  If you're the sort of person that doesn't play around with the dynamic difficulty system (Bastion's Pantheon : Transistor's Limiters) you may find the game easy once you've unlocked some of the more powerful functions (I found it a bit trivial even with half the limiters on).  A New Game + feature and use of all the limiters is an easy remedy for those wanting more gameplay and more challenge.\n\nThree things that are fab:\n# Turn() system and executing sets that make you feel like a genius\n# Wonderfully detailed world and story\n# Extra story exposition linked to use of Functions for that extra bit of OCD fodder\n\nThree things that are butt:\n# May not work immediately on some computers\n# No Steamplay support as of yet\n# A bit easy for those seeking a teeth-grinding experience\n\nAll in all, Transistor is a wonderful nugget of a game that you shouldn't hesistate to pick up, even at its introductory price-point.  If you liked Bastion for its artistic elements, you'll love Transistor, and if you enjoy tactical games you may end up liking Transistor even more than Bastion.  I know I did!  The main story lasted me roughly nine hours when doing everything available, and I have a bit of a completionist bent.  I have just started a New Game+ session.","June 27, 2014","true","10.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It excels on many levels, and has definitely become one of my favorite games up to date.\n\nThe story of Red, a singer gone mute, and her companion sword, the Transistor, is told with just the right amount of ambiguity and subtle cues. Decidedly leaving some questions open while you play, Transistor invites you to piece it together yourself - the little hints regarding Red's background and how she ended up on her own are stunning to put together. Paced just right, it is truly a unique experience for the player.\n\nThe gameplay, too, is quite fun. The mixture between turn-based strategy and action helps the player to find their own rhythm - a rapid, high-risk approach, or a carefully planned out attack: It is up to the player. Furthermore, the RPG elements of this game are very entertaining. Even though I found myself very comfortable with a certain set of functions early on, the game encouraged me to try out new combinations both through story and challenge incentives. I have to say that I am glad that they did, for I've long left my original set behind. And now with New Game+, one can explore even more of its versatility!\n\nAnd of course, Transistor stands out as a visually stunning, and audibly well told tale that was to be expected from Supergiant Games. Like Bastion, all assets have the beautiful 2D quality to them, and take it to the next level. Jen Zee's art direction is impeccable and truly comes to shine in this beautiful game. Darren Korb's soundtrack complements the visual side of it with a  jazzy and relaxed style, truly emphasizing the artwork of the game.\n\nTransistor is a game that every gamer should have in their library. Every aspect of it is outstanding - gameplay, visuals, soundtrack and storytelling - and thus makes it a gem worth having.","May 23, 2014","true","16.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've been tracking it since its announcement at E3, watched all the demos and trailers, received it on the release day, have the soundtrack on my phone, and at the time of posting this I have racked up about 14 hours on the game. I will say if you're expecting a casual game of the typical demographic of 13-17 year old boys, this has no time for you. This game requires patience, attention, and heart. It is not the game's fault if you do not feel the need to provide it with these then seek to trash it for "not being good enough". Before you judge it, follow my suggestion of listening to all the dialogue and at least attempt to finish it. The game should take someone who is not rushed about 10 hours; not long at all. This game is a story and an experience, not something you can mindlessly blow through.\n\nMy final rating is 10/10, simply because it brought me to tears not once, not twice, but three times, and I'll happily cry again just to play through it once more to immerse myself in its beautiful story.","May 25, 2014","true","20.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Did all the challenge arenas (That were available to me, not sure why one or two end ones were locked in the final scene.).  Read a decent amount, all the terminals I saw, but passed some of the character bios on the Function() screens.\n\nCalmly playing through, listening to the story, "exploring" what few detours there were, and it's a 6-7 hour game in a playthrough.\n\nThough, the game's narration didn't grab me the same as Bastion's did, and a good half to 3/4ths of the story is in the text.  It was a tad shorter than I expected for a first run-down.  But the combat did make up for it, while interesting to tackle, there's a myriad of combinations that only get more interesting down the line.   NG+ might be worth it to many, and I might dabble in it later on, but it's not something I'll mention as a way to extend what is a story-driven game for later playthroughs.\n\nOverall, I'm not disappointed with my $20.  I would recommend others who aren't dying for the game or just HAVE to play something new right now to wait until it's in the $10-15 bracket. Give or take if you get the soundtrack with it.   It's a nifty little game, with lovely design, simply stunning combat, and a story that just obscures itself a little more than I would have liked.","May 22, 2014","true","12.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Supergiant play to their strengths, which is an isometric 3d world with beautiul art, a sweet soundtrack and a narrator that narrates everything about you in a nice rich voice.\n\nThe problem I have with it is largely that, though. Supergiant stuck to their strengths and did not really push much of any boundaries, and it wasn't really that novel; Bastion 2.0, really.\n\nThe main innovation is in the combat system, which I do sorta like - hate having to use Turn(), love how all your attacks work as primary attacks, upgrade modules or passive items. I also like the semi-online aspect, where you can see ghosts of other people, a'la Dark Souls. (At least, I'm pretty sure they are, and I'm sure the numerous polls you use are actually being formed by other players voting as well)\n\nOne bug I had, which wasn't fatal, but severely annoying in that my game randomly locks up for maybe 3 seconds when I do things like attack.\n\nWorth buying -- if you've played Bastion, though, might want to wait until it's like $15 or cheaper instead of the full $20, because they feel like the same game almost.","May 21, 2014","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

Adding difficulty this way gives bonus exp.\n- Has checkpoints that allow you to change your loadout almost every 2-3 minutes.\n\nBad/not as good:\n- Took me 4 hours to beat, could have been a little longer, but wasn't needed.

Not sure what they could have done to make this better though, since I found the combat system really enjoyable.\n- Some of the lore is locked behind your combat abilities, and this lore is unlocked by using the abilities as just a normal ability, as an upgrade to an existing ability, or as a passive bonus. I understand that this is done to make you explore different ability-combinations and to try out all of the different combinations, but I found it annoying that I had to change away from my favorite loadout if I wanted the complete story.","May 22, 2014","true","4.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The design, the art style. It's just second to none.\nAlso, the soundtrack. It's a masterpiece.\nThe game mechanics, including fights, are far better and improved comparing to Bastion. They are easy to master, very nice to handle on both 360 Pad and mouse+keyboard. No problem there at all everything is great. The turn-based and real-time combat mix works PERFECT. I was afraid of this before the release but it turned out to be just amazingly done making you want to use both and blend them together.\nSkill/Functions/Character development is innovative and give you a lot, and I mean A LOT of different possible builds and the game itself/story development does a great job on encouraging you to switch your tactics as often as you can.\n\nAlthough. After finishing I think, that I liked Bastion a little bit better. Probably because it was first and it was a surprise. The only thing I'd like Transistor to have is a bit more lore given to you by the narrator. Not through the people's description which you can find, but through the sword itself. Like Bastion did it.\n\nIf you haven't played Bastion and you're thinking about getting Transistor: Play Bastion first.\nIf you played Bastion and you're thinking about getting Transistor: Please, by all means.\nIf you do not like how the game looks, or you are not into the SciFi or anything: Well, if you read it - try it. Sometimes we appreciate something that we do not necessarily like at first sight.\n\nTook me ~8 hours to complete. I was taking my time though, reading everything I could find.\n\nGame as close to perfection as this happens very rarely. Do not think, buy and play!\n\n9+/10.

A lot of the enemies often feel cheap, and while on one hand I can praise the game for making me switch up my combat build consistently, the real reason I switched so much was because none of them really felt right.\n\nOverall I'd say 7.5/10, with the missing points purely because of the wanting combat which is a damn shame.

Definitely not a walk in the park but it also wasn't super easy. The experience is definitely best enjoyed playing with the added difficulty provided by Limiters and in Recursion Mode where you keep your progress but replay through the game with heightened difficulty. Enemies will scale up to your current level and ability in the game in the 2nd go-around.\n\nPraises aside, the game has some performance issues that will hopefully be ironed out in future updates and I feel like the experience was missing something. I was under the impression that the game would have some more puzzle features given an earlier sequence, but it's almost entirely combat oriented with Turn() being a strategic, puzzle mode.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone looking for a a refreshing experience and who enjoys an immersive environment.

The music is fantastic and a mix of ambient songs with five vocal tracks that call back to the plot of the game itself. “Red” is a character of unfortunate circumstances who must piece together what happened to the city she inhabits.\n\nCombat is done in pseudo turn-based mode, or all in real time. The mechanics of combat remain very fresh due to the skill system. Each skill can be used in its own right, or slotted into another skill to serve as an enhancement to the base skill. Therein lays the dilemma, do you use this skill as a main skill or a passive skill? There are certainly rewards for changing up your build as well.\n\nThere is a sizable amount of optional content. Lore is tucked nicely in with combat skills you unlock as you progress through the game. The tutorial is there but it isn’t patronizing, in fact it’s one of the best I’ve seen in years. Controller support is in the game as well as a native support of keyboard and mouse. The controls are responsive for the most part, some skills can require a bit more precision than Red sometimes wants to give.\n\nTransistor is easily in my top three games for 2013/2014.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/7upchuck/recommended/237930/","7upchuck","Optimist Prime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/7upchuck/","535 products in account","Transistor is a fantastic game. The artwork is beautiful and the combat is challenging and fun. Dying doesn't make the fight feel unfair or impossible, it simply makes you plan your skills and tactics better for the next time. There are tests much like those found in Bastion to really test your skill which are indeed difficult, yet certainly accomplishable, and they reward you with a song for completing them that you can listen to in the game at your leisure. The boss fights in this one are actually fun too, and satisfying to complete.\nThe plot is interesting and grips you as you uncover the mystery for where everything went wrong (and there's even a reason for the *silent* protaganist! gasp!). The protagonist(s) feel alive and you genuinely care for them, hoping they can see it through to the end and make everything better. The game took about 6 hours for me to complete the first playthrough while taking my time, so it's certainly not too short but not long either.\nThe music is also very nice and fits well where it comes up, often pumping you up or feeling very haunting. My only gripe is that perhaps it is a little bit TOO similar to Bastion in the world-building and certain other aspects (though I can't blame them for it, nor do I dislike it, as Bastion's my favorite indie title.) Despite that, I honestly can't say there's anything I really  didn't  like about this game. Not a ton of replay value for those that don't fall in love with it, but the same could be said for any game. For 20 bucks it's a wonderful indie title worth experiencing. And drop 10 more for that sweet soundtrack!\n\ntl;dr: This game is challenging, beautiful, and amazing.

Similarly to their previous game, the art, story, and sound design are all fantastic. The combat is a weird hybrid between real-time and turn-based that will probably be hit-or-miss with most people. The robust skill system was incredible and is probably one of Transistor's best features.\n\nThe combat is different than most other games. You can move and attack in real time, but you'll find it difficult to survive without using the Turn() feature. Turn() pauses the game and allows you to plan out your next few movements and attacks. The planned actions will then be executed very quickly, without the enemies being able to attack or move. Turn() then goes on cooldown for a few seconds and most of your skill won't be usable. This creates a turn-like tempo in the the fights where you attack with Turn() and then play defensively when it's on cooldown.  The combat takes a little getting used to and won't be for everyone, but it really works well with the skill system.\n\nThe skill system is one of the games best features. I didn't unlock all of the skill on the first playthough, but there are at least 16 of them. Each skill can be used in 3 ways.\n1. Active Skill: The skills you use in combat. You get 4 active skill slots.\n2. Augementation: Each active slot has two augmentation slots which alter the effect of the active skill.\n3. Passive Skill: Each skill has a different passive effect when placed in one of the 4 passive slots.\n\nAlthough this seems to be overly complex, you only start with a couple skills, the 4 active slots, and an augmentation slot for each of them. You gain additional skills and slots when you level up so the game does a good job of easing you into the skill system. Furthermore, the game does an excellent job of pushing you to experiement and try new skill combinations. I had a lot of fun experimenting with the skills and trying to find effective combinations.\n\nIn conclusion, Transistor is a great game. If you liked Bastion, or are a fan of turn based RPGs, you should get this game. If you're unsure that you'll like the combat, you should look at a couple gameplay videos, but try not to spoil the story for yourself.","May 22, 2014","true","15.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The deep customization of your abilities with the various Functions(), the blend of real time frantic play with the powerful frozen planning of Turn(), and difficulty scaling done right make all the game extremely enjoyable to play. There are unbelievably powerful ability combos in the game, but you're always facing enemies that can meet the challenge. If you're not, then there's still the combat modifiers and restrictions you can add.\n\nStory-wise, the world is significantly more sparse and spare than Supergiant's previous title, Bastion, but it seems to be an intentional choice: a bit of mystery allows for varied interpretations and a long narrative shelf life, which is what I think they were going for in this game. I think they leaned a little too far in the direction of limiting information, but the game doesn't suffer for it too much. I think the endgame buildup and final fight were excellently executed and they are going to be a favorite among the games I've played.","May 22, 2014","true","20.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I can think of extremely few titles that are as much of a product of love and care, as detailed and as emotionally engaging as Transistor. It's not a single element that does it - it's everything in the game coming together in one awe-inspiring work of art that is unique and completely breathtaking, From its artwork and environment design to its themes and backstory, its fleshed out and relatable characters and its heartrendingly tragic story and conclusion. I went in with really high expectations, which I usually really try not to do, but not only were my expectations met, they were exceeded in all aspects. There wasn't a single thing that stood out to me as being there just as a filler - everything looked and felt like it had an important role and was relevant to the overarching plot. It says so much with so little, and invites you to explore the world yourself, which you undoubtedly WILL do, because the immersion I felt playing Transistor has only been matched by 2 titles in all my years of playing games since the NES era. The amazing attention to detail is not only worthy of the highest praise and enhances the atmosphere hundred-fold, it also serves to strengthen the emotional connection you feel to Red and Breach(). And the music... Oh my GOD, the music. I really, genuinely can't find words to describe it. The way it's interwoven with the story, the way it reflects the environment and the way it changes with it, the absolutely tear-inducingly gorgeous vocals of Ashley Barrett, the way it peaks and dips at key points, the intensity and beauty of it made me shed tears so many times. The small touches like the Flourish and the humming are incredible additions. The humming especially is one of the saddest things in the game in terms of its significance.\nI don't want to touch on the story itself, because that's something one must experience on his own, but I will say this: Transistor isn't a dystopian RPG. It isn't a tactical or strategic action RPG. More than anything, it's a tragedy with a heart-rending love story interwoven into it; a tale of choices and consequences.\nI CANNOT recommend this game more. I could go on praising it forever, and it deserves every last bit of it. I don't know how Supergiant did this. I can't fathom all the work that went into Transistor and its soundtrack, but it was worth every bit, because what they started with the gorgeous Bastion, they did so much better with Transistor. They have grown so much in so little time, and I mean that in the best way possible. THey've developed and matured as a studio even more.\nOf course, they won't get the recognition they deserve, because people will be too busy praising the next cookie-cutter bland multi-million dollar AAA title, likely a shooter, and Transistor won't win many "awards"; it likely won't be GOTY or whatever other overhyped title people care about. But really, to me, that recognition isn't worth that much. What IS worth something is the way Supergiant touched the hearts of so many fans and showed that, once again, they can deliver a product of IMMACULATE quality. And to me, that means more than any award ever could. It's the best game I've played this year so far by a huge margin and I doubt anything will surpass it.\nThank you, Supergiant.

The narrative pulled me along - and the world never lost it's curious nature. I found myself wanting to know what was next every moment I played. Something unique about transistor personally, for me. I haven't seen many games that pulled me a long the way it had.\n\nFrom an Artists perspective - may I just say this game is gorgeous. It's truly beautiful. I tried to savor every single location because of it. The immense use of color and vibrancy in some areas is literally awe inspiring. The designers and Artists who put their time into this game must have really enjoyed the whole process - because I can't fathom anything of this quality being made without considerable love and devotion to it.\n\nGameplaywise? This game was challenging and fun. The way combat worked was unique to itself - and I enjoyed how much customization your abilities had. It's honestly impressive and fun to sit there figuring out how to build a character. I found myself drawn to a combination of summoning my pet luna and using her in conjunction with other control abilities. But there were so many different ways to go about this.\n\nThe soundtrack, well.. how else can I put it? I'd have bought this if it were just /music/ it is so wonderful. But the narrative it flows along with can't be put to the side, either. The narrative the game follows gives quite a few on the songs an amazing meaning to the lyrics and themes - I enjoyed listening to each song and seeing how it told things the story hadn't quite covered.\n\nThe story - my god the story. I'm not the toughest guy in the world, but I sure as hell don't cry over nothing. Without revealing too much, let me tell you the person who made this game's story was a genius. It's so beautiful on so many levels. I pride myself on the ability to take something away from a game's meaning and message - and this is a game that has a beautiful message at it's heart.\n\nIf I had to say one thing about the ending, I would say it was exactly what I wanted - but not what I had expected whatsoever. You are always on your toes during the whole experience - you never quite see where it's going - and that's the most amazing thing I've ever experienced in a game of 2014. I reccomend this to all of my friends - and pretty much the whole gaming community.\n\nThis is something you don't want to miss. It's truly something that won't be forgotten. 10/10","November 2, 2014","true","9.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While the main storyline is quite short (4-5 hours if you plow right through it), there is also a few minor side modes where you can test out different combinations and variants and do a few little fun challenges. While they do not particularly add anything to the game, it's certainly a nice feature to have.\n\nThe thing that really stole my heart with Transistor could just be summed up as "ARRRRRRRTTT". From the atmospheric melodies to the unique water color-esque design, everything in Transistor's environment flows so perfectly together that between encounters with enemies I constantly found myself stopping and just admiring the world with the designated hum-button. That's right, there's literally a designated button that Red holds the Transistor lovingly and hums along to the BGM, no matter what. Don't even get me started on the other designated button where you prance.\n\nI suppose I should also address the gameplay, which would involve me in feverishly googling synonyms for "perfect", "tight", and "godlike". The core gameplay allows Red to swap out abilities from main slots, sub slots, as well as passive slots. For example, if you put the summon dogs ability on a main slot, then an explosive AOE ability as the sub slot, the dogs' barks explode, and vice versa. With a good chunk of abilities to play with, there are hundreds of variants and attributes that can go into your 4 main slots (each with 2 sub slots each) and 4 passive slots.\n\nIf this game is ever on sale, get it.

Ha... The narrator is also the same voice as in Bastion, yet somehow the role he plays manages to be entirely different this time around.\nVery importantly, the game isn't lacking in its set of mechanics either. The combat system is deep and highly customisable, with not only the options of building attacks and defenses but real-time and turn-based mode as well. The limiters available can raise the difficulty if so desired. The game is just a little short, but definitely replayable in NG+.\n\nOverall, Transistor is just awesome.

The artwork, music, story and acting is phenomenal, and the gameplay is rock solid --- just like Bastion, by which I mean that it's great like Bastion is great, but also that it's great in pretty much the exact same ways that Bastion is great. It's not Bastion 2, but you wouldn't know it if it wasn't for the title. I can certainly understand that it'd be nearly impossible for SuperGiant Games to release a game without having it constantly compared to Bastion --- and maybe that's why they chose to not deviate too much from what made Bastion amazing. I don't know. But I have already played Bastion and been thoroughly amazed by it. Obviously a second iteration of the formula isn't going to leave the same impression, and thus Transistor falls a little flat, which is completely unfair to say after using adjectives such as "phenomenal" and "rock solid" about it, but that's the reality. It's a phenomenal and rock solid game that somehow doesn't quite impress as much as you'd expect it to. I'd still recommend it in a heartbeat though. And, I do want to say that the biggest deviation from SuperGiant Games' previous indie smash hit, the combat system, is really, really good and it makes battles feel very futuristic, manageable and awesome.\n\nTL;DR: This game has everything that Bastion had --- and more. And that is, however weird it may sound, probably its weakest point.","July 12, 2014","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Transistor not only has a nice aesthetic, but a handful of well implemented and creative gameplay mechanics. It is a healthy marriage of arcade power-ups and tactics, where player experimentation is key. For games that promise both live and turn based action, the player is usually given the choice between either - in Transistor you will want to master both forms of gameplay if you wish to gain the edge.\n\nThe most intriguing part of the game is the power-up system. Throughout the game the player collects a series of "functions". These functions can be used as new attacks - choosing up to a total of four moves. Each function has a unique effect, letting the player choose from sneak attacks, long range strikes, clustering explosions, summoning minions, and more, or any combination of these. But the functions aren't limited to simple attacks. In addition to the four move slots, the player also has four passive slots to install their functions, and each move has two upgrade slots. The upgrades are really something special, allowing the player to improve and expand on or even change completely the nature of a move. As the player collects more of these functions, playstyles can become more and more diverse. The number of possibilities are staggering.\n\nThe gameplay itself is challenging enough that certain combinations may be found ineffective or require careful planning and skill to use. This is what makes the game whole as an interactive experience. The player has to strategize, adapt, evaluate, refine, rearrange. You can't just brute force your way through (though certain combinations do give a whole new meaning to "brute force"). You can't just grind to max stats and max gear.\n\nIf you like games that emphasize tactics and positioning, and enjoy making lots of experimental play styles. THIS is the game for YOU. If you don't, well, do me a favor, play it anyway.","November 6, 2015","true","23.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/helldee/recommended/237930/","helldee","eldee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/helldee/","402 products in account","Alright, first and foremost let me point out that I have recommended this game, which will contrast with what will sound like a negative review. If it comes off that way it's because I felt like Transistor could have been so much more, but standing next to Bastion it's withering in the shade. Overall it was an enjoyable experience, but at the end of the day I'm glad I got it on sale or I might have been very disappointed.\n\nLet's start with the things I enjoyed about the game. The thing that jumps out first is that there's a lot of love behind this game. You can tell that Supergiant wanted to really connect with their audience by creating an immersive world and characters that you can sympathize with. The real-time/active-time combat tries new things while staying grounded in somewhat familiar territory for most strategy/rpg fans, and being able to 'socket' abilities into other abilities makes for some interesting emergent play-styles.\n\nNow for the things I didn't find very enjoyable, or thought could have been done better:\n\nFirst- about that immersive environment Supergiant wanted to create in Transistor. Personally, I felt like that was a total whiff. They should have called this game Esoterica, because it's filled with fluff that is never explained. It's like picking up a sci-fi book you've never read before and know nothing about- picking a random page in the middle, and reading for four hours. By the end you know more than you did at the beginning, but you're still lost for the most part.. you're missing fundamental information to make sense of the story.\n\nAs far as the characters go, I wanted to feel connected to them- I read every little bio and sought out every OVA station to learn more about the world and its inhabitants- but it feels hollow. Like they're trying too hard to live up to Bastion, which achieved greatness in both gameplay and storytelling almost effortlessly.\n\nI found the "narrator" in this game to be completely obnoxious. In Bastion the narrator added a lot of flavor and backstory to the world, since as a third party witness to the events that were going down, he could provide information that the player needed to feel connected to the things that were happening around them. In Transistor, he just monologues.. it's like going on a road trip with somebody who can't make meaningful conversation and doesn't like the sound of silence so they read every billboard you see. Eventually you would rather swerve into oncoming traffic than hear that there's a Cracker Barrel in 2.7 miles.\n\nThe game itself is reasonably fun, if a bit repetitive (which is kind of a strike against it in its own right... how can a game with so much personality be repetitive after only 3 hours?). The ability socketing system is a very interesting spin on the whole 'play how you want RPG' genre. It's easily exploitable for those who want an easier time with things- but for players looking for a challenge can apply handicaps that award you with additional experience at the cost of a harder game. I would have liked to see a bit more variety here, but it's clear that they were designing a 4 hour game and not a 20 hour game.\n\nI ran into a LOT of bugs, which was disappointing considering how late to the Transistor party I am. Supergiant has had ample time to fine tune the experience- but I was running into issues where all of the AI models were missing (you could mouse over them and get tooltips, but the models were missing). A few times during combat I was teleported outside of the "ring" and couldn't get back in, so I was locked into a combat state and couldn't end the fight- so I had to force-close and restart. And just pathing issues in general.. plenty of times I'd click on a point to run to, but Red would choose the most bizarre path to get to an unobstructed position. This happened frequently during combat turns, where the incorrect path taken would basically ruin all of the proceeding commands (attacks firing into thin air, etc). It wasn't so frequent that it was game-breaking, but it happened enough to merit mentioning.\n\nAnd if you don't want any spoilers, this is probably a good spot to stop reading because I need to vent about something that happens at the very end of the game.\n\n\nStill here? Okay. So one of the things I'd read about this game was that it had a "strong female lead" and that supergiant was doing a great service to female gamers with Transistor. Now, full disclosure- I'm a dude, so it's entirely possible that I don't get it. I fully recognize that I may in fact lack the extra "X" chromosome to understand what girl gamers are looking for in a game with a female lead. However, at the end of the game when Red chooses to off herself to be with this guy we (the player) know nothing about had my eyes rolling into the back of my head. I felt like it was a cheap romantic plug at the end of what could have been a somewhat interesting (albiet confusing) story. Here she is with the 'brush' that could remake the world- she could un♥♥♥♥ everything that the calimari or whoever destroyed. But instead she rebuilds a plaza, then sits down next to the narrator's body and stabs herself with the big blue sword. Poetic I guess? Maybe we need more context. Maybe the world isn't worth saving if they can't be together, but Supergiant gave us NOTHING on this guy. Not a name, not a backstory.. nothing. His bio card is "Unknown" with zero information.\n\nAnyway.. It's worth playing. It has its problems, but it did not live up to my expectations at all.","January 18, 2015","true","4.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay is fused into its sci-fi world, and everything about it is blended with jargon from informatics, computers, programming, technology etc. The combat system is evolved, engaging and suprisingly deep and diverse.\n\nThe Good(1) Art-style is awesome. (2) Music is fantastic, original and merged with the story. Red, the protagonist, is a singer who has lost her voice, and for that reason there's a dedicated "Hum" button, where the game pauses and Red hums to background music! (3) Combat system is a very interesting and well balanced blend of real-time with pause-and-give-orders: You can fight in real time (which is hard!) or you can use the "Turn()" command to give orders which are then executed sequentially by Red while her enemies are slowed down (nearly stopped). After that, Turn() requires several seconds to recover before you can use it again; it the meanwhile you can't use any abilities and just need to run around in real-time avoiding enemies.\n\nThe Bad(1) The story can be confusing. Despite the very few characters, it's often hard to understand why Red, the protagonist, does what she does. It took me two playthroughs and reading a thorough guide, to understand what was going on. Nevertheless, you can "breeze" through the game just for the feeling without losing much, but understanding the story adds to the emotional experience. (2) The sci-fi jargon --informatics, computers, programming, technology-- can also be confusing. I have some skill in the department and it wasn't all that easy for me either. The GUI is good at explaining things, but you gotta spend some time to check things out. (3) The game is not good at revealing the depth of its combat system. Also, with the main story being relatively short, you can reach the ending and beat the game without needing to grasp the mechanics. My second playthrough (NG+) was much more entertaining, as was doing all the optional "Tests" offered.\n\n*** Comparison to Bastion: I liked Bastion's narrator better, as well as the delivery of the story, which was way simpler. Also, I believe that Bastion was better at hooking you up into its gameplay. Transistor has much better combat system, but it's not so good at hooking you up.

The audio, oh lord the audio, not only does this game feature my absolute favorite soundtrack of any video game I have ever played, but it fits the ambience in a way that is truly beyond words.\nWithout giving away anything, the story is intriguing to say the least. It absorbs you from the very beginning and makes you want to keep playing to find out more and more about the world. The characters are equally as interesting and mysterious. The game really makes your imagination run wild.\nThe gameplay is simple when you want it to be, as well as complex and difficult should you choose. It is almost a turn-based game but not quite. The core mechanics revolve around pausing fights and executing movements and attacks. Very simplistic on paper, but with the amount of customization available with all of the abilities you obtain, it has endless replay potential.\nI can honest to goodness give this game a 10/10 rating, the only possible gripe I could have with it is that it wasn’t longer.

The battle system couldn't be more impressive, as you must have a lot of vision on what will happen to decide your own actions in a turn, taking into account not only the reactions you cause with your actions, but the actions the enemy may take when you attack. One such example is the Younglady (no spoilers are given), which can be somewhat frustrating at first, but it still makes you want to keep trying untill you finally manage to break the pattern. This not to mention the huge amount of possibilities there are to use the Functions in many different ways, using them as Active, Passive or Upgrades.

First and foremost is continued use of Bastion's characteristic piece-by-piece narrative structure, this time with the help of a new narrator whose rough mumbling voice is surprisingly well suited to the staggered delivery. The game further draws inspiration from Bastion's niche musical style, bringing that surreal feminine voice to the fore with a hummed melody over almost every track in the game and continuing with the dark isolating tunes that leave the player stuck within the character's head in an unknown world.\n\nUsing a similar camera and layout structure as Bastion, Transistor's gameplay sets itself apart through a series of equippable nodes collected throughout the story, each with its own unique effect depending on whether it's used as the base attack, an upgrade to a base attack, or a passive item. These nodes can be temporarily sidelined when your health runs out in combat and, as challenges become harder and your collection of nodes becomes larger, you'll find yourself shuffling them about into new combinations before each new stretch of the game, crafting hundreds of different attacks from the dozen or so nodes you will collect.\n\nThis game is gorgeous, by the way. The colors are mind-numbingly vibrant at times and the in-game stills give you that same giddy feeling you get when flipping through an "Art of ..." book for your favorite movie or game.

The artwork, music, story and acting is phenomenal, and the gameplay is rock solid --- just like Bastion, by which I mean that it's great like Bastion is great, but also that it's great in pretty much the exact same ways that Bastion is great. It's not Bastion 2, but you wouldn't know it if it wasn't for the title. I can certainly understand that it'd be nearly impossible for SuperGiant Games to release a game without having it constantly compared to Bastion --- and maybe that's why they chose to not deviate too much from what made Bastion amazing. I don't know. But I have already played Bastion and been thoroughly amazed by it. Obviously a second iteration of the formula isn't going to leave the same impression, and thus Transistor falls a little flat, which is completely unfair to say after using adjectives such as "phenomenal" and "rock solid" about it, but that's the reality. It's a phenomenal and rock solid game that somehow doesn't quite impress as much as you'd expect it to. I'd still recommend it in a heartbeat though. And, I do want to say that the biggest deviation from SuperGiant Games' previous indie smash hit, the combat system, is really, really good and it makes battles feel very futuristic, manageable and awesome.\n\nTL;DR: This game has everything that Bastion had --- and more.

Well, that's right, but it's not just that. This game has a whole lot of content to be explored, such as the backstory of Cloudbank, the reasons behind the Process starting their attacks on Goldwalk, how and why Red got the Transistor and what's the connection between her and the one inside the Transistor. The battle system couldn't be more impressive, as you must have a lot of vision on what will happen to decide your own actions in a turn, taking into account not only the reactions you cause with your actions, but the actions the enemy may take when you attack. One such example is the Younglady (no spoilers are given), which can be somewhat frustrating at first, but it still makes you want to keep trying untill you finally manage to break the pattern. This not to mention the huge amount of possibilities there are to use the Functions in many different ways, using them as Active, Passive or Upgrades. I was very satisfied with the story, gameplay, visual, soundtrack... The game as a whole is astonishing.

While my device isn't optimized for gaming at all, I'm still able to run the game fairly smoothly, although I of course cannot enjoy it in all its beauty. The original soundtrack is good enough to be worth buying as DLC.\n\nFinally, Transistor's story is one that will make your head hurt - in a good way! It doesn't have any ugly plotholes or leave you confused, but you will definitely be pondering about it for quite some time after completing it.\n\nThough I bought Transistor on sale, I can truthfully say that it is more than worth its full price; I absolutely recommend buying this game to anyone considering doing so.","December 30, 2015","true","12.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Transistor not only has a nice aesthetic, but a handful of well implemented and creative gameplay mechanics. It is a healthy marriage of arcade power-ups and tactics, where player experimentation is key. For games that promise both live and turn based action, the player is usually given the choice between either - in Transistor you will want to master both forms of gameplay if you wish to gain the edge.\n\nThe most intriguing part of the game is the power-up system. Throughout the game the player collects a series of "functions". These functions can be used as new attacks - choosing up to a total of four moves. Each function has a unique effect, letting the player choose from sneak attacks, long range strikes, clustering explosions, summoning minions, and more, or any combination of these. But the functions aren't limited to simple attacks. In addition to the four move slots, the player also has four passive slots to install their functions, and each move has two upgrade slots. The upgrades are really something special, allowing the player to improve and expand on or even change completely the nature of a move. As the player collects more of these functions, playstyles can become more and more diverse. The number of possibilities are staggering.\n\nThe gameplay itself is challenging enough that certain combinations may be found ineffective or require careful planning and skill to use. This is what makes the game whole as an interactive experience. The player has to strategize, adapt, evaluate, refine, rearrange. You can't just brute force your way through (though certain combinations do give a whole new meaning to "brute force"). You can't just grind to max stats and max gear.\n\nIf you like games that emphasize tactics and positioning, and enjoy making lots of experimental play styles. THIS is the game for YOU. If you don't, well, do me a favor, play it anyway.","November 6, 2015","true","23.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While the main storyline is quite short (4-5 hours if you plow right through it), there is also a few minor side modes where you can test out different combinations and variants and do a few little fun challenges. While they do not particularly add anything to the game, it's certainly a nice feature to have.\n\nThe thing that really stole my heart with Transistor could just be summed up as "ARRRRRRRTTT". From the atmospheric melodies to the unique water color-esque design, everything in Transistor's environment flows so perfectly together that between encounters with enemies I constantly found myself stopping and just admiring the world with the designated hum-button. That's right, there's literally a designated button that Red holds the Transistor lovingly and hums along to the BGM, no matter what. Don't even get me started on the other designated button where you prance.\n\nI suppose I should also address the gameplay, which would involve me in feverishly googling synonyms for "perfect", "tight", and "godlike". The core gameplay allows Red to swap out abilities from main slots, sub slots, as well as passive slots. For example, if you put the summon dogs ability on a main slot, then an explosive AOE ability as the sub slot, the dogs' barks explode, and vice versa. With a good chunk of abilities to play with, there are hundreds of variants and attributes that can go into your 4 main slots (each with 2 sub slots each) and 4 passive slots.\n\nIf this game is ever on sale, get it.

Enemies will scale up to your current level and ability in the game in the 2nd go-around.\n\nPraises aside, the game has some performance issues that will hopefully be ironed out in future updates and I feel like the experience was missing something.

And the details are definitely worth looking in to. The mechanics are stupidly fun to play with. Darren Korb absolutely knocks it out of the park with the soundtrack much like he did with Bastion. And the story, though you may have some qualms about the ending, is deep and lovely in its own right.\n\nThe overall experience of the game flows very well, and everything just feels cohesive.","November 29, 2014","true","33.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you've played Bastion, and are wondering how Transistor fares in comparison with it, know that this game pulls all the right inspiration from SPG's previous release, but maintains its own identity to set it apart as something truly original.\n\nLike Bastion, Transistor is a narrative-driven game with emphasis on configurable gameplay, i.e. loadouts. There's optional difficulty modifiers and the game plays in standard psuedo-isometric fashion. But the similarities end there. Unlike Bastion, Transistor's fighting system is much more diverse and complex; more RPG, less action-adventure. A core component of that system is something called 'Turn()' mode, which essentially shifts the game from real-time to turn-based action. I find Transistor's combat system to be incredibly unique, and something that enables multiple play styles to shine through.\n\nThe story of the game, while similar to Bastion, in that it's a linear, narrative-driven plot, is again, just superficially similar. While the narrator in Bastion is more so telling a story, the narrator in Transistor isn't really a narrator at all. He's another character, with his own perspective and reactions on what's going on around him. He doesn't really tell the story so much as he does experience it. The real meat of lore is actually acquired through using abilities you've gathered in various ways. This is a vastly different take on storytelling because one may not have even uncovered the whole thing through one playthrough. I believe though, that the game meant to be played like that; it's meant to be played through more than once. And it's obvious, as the New Game+ mode is called a 'Recursion'. For some, this may be a turn off, which is understandable. After my first playthrough, I was left with more questions than answers. It left a slightly sour taste in mouth, but after playing more and uncovering all that there was to be uncovered, I enjoyed the story much more than I initially did. It's a very different way to tell a story, but I think fans will appreciate it.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Transistor. It has creative, unique gameplay with a story that is equally as intriguing. Not to mention the beautiful art and soundtrack, which is worth buying in its own right!","June 23, 2014","true","23.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As the story goes, you play a rogue vocalist on a quest to find out the meaning behind the mysterious events happening around her. The most important of which involving the accidental death of one of her biggest fans by a sword called the Transistor.\n\nYou might think the gameplay is somewhat similar to Bastion and if you were to ignore the Turn() aspect, you would probably be right. However, this is where the game distances itself: at any point during combat, you can stop time and plan your next few moves, in a sequence, to be executed when you press the end turn button. This allows for some significant advantages over certain hardy foes that would normally steamroll you in real-time. Additionally, each of the processes you pick up can be slotted in one of three roes: active (for active-weapon use), upgrade (boosts active weapon), or passive (various passive benefits). This allows for a wide variety of process assignments that really lets you find your own personal combat style. If for some reason, you find the game to be too easy, you can add ‘limiters’ you have earned at any save point to spice things up in exchange for extra experience.\n\nI found the narrator to be a bit sycophantic, almost to the point where I expected him to wear a fedora and use phrases like “m’lady” while rambling about what it is to be “a gentleman” (especially certain parts of the game where he resembled a drunk version of himself with embarrassingly low levels of restraint). Despite all the cringe, the game is pretty fun and a good challenge if you turn on all the limiters and there are some challenge sections that may warrant a replay if you so desire.","January 10","true","11.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Transistor not only has a nice aesthetic, but a handful of well implemented and creative gameplay mechanics. It is a healthy marriage of arcade power-ups and tactics, where player experimentation is key. For games that promise both live and turn based action, the player is usually given the choice between either - in Transistor you will want to master both forms of gameplay if you wish to gain the edge.\n\nThe most intriguing part of the game is the power-up system. Throughout the game the player collects a series of "functions". These functions can be used as new attacks - choosing up to a total of four moves. Each function has a unique effect, letting the player choose from sneak attacks, long range strikes, clustering explosions, summoning minions, and more, or any combination of these. But the functions aren't limited to simple attacks. In addition to the four move slots, the player also has four passive slots to install their functions, and each move has two upgrade slots. The upgrades are really something special, allowing the player to improve and expand on or even change completely the nature of a move. As the player collects more of these functions, playstyles can become more and more diverse. The number of possibilities are staggering.\n\nThe gameplay itself is challenging enough that certain combinations may be found ineffective or require careful planning and skill to use. This is what makes the game whole as an interactive experience. The player has to strategize, adapt, evaluate, refine, rearrange. You can't just brute force your way through (though certain combinations do give a whole new meaning to "brute force"). You can't just grind to max stats and max gear.\n\nIf you like games that emphasize tactics and positioning, and enjoy making lots of experimental play styles. THIS is the game for YOU. If you don't, well, do me a favor, play it anyway.","November 6, 2015","true","23.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have a sword but it's not a sword, it's a transistor. Don't worry about it, it still kills people. Well, processes mainly, but it killed that guy I liked. I think I liked him? Anyway, it wasn't the swords fault. Some people really disliked my singing and decided to stab the guy I was crushing on, leaving the transistor/sword imbedded in him.\n\nThe transistor/sword talks to me. It's the spirit of the dead guy. He rambles on about something that I don't understand and he talks over news articles I'm trying to read. Then he forgets what he's trying to say and in the process becomes even more annoying as he tries to make sense of his own existence.  On my quest to avenge the guy I barely know I meet a few other people but I can't understand a word they say. No, wait, subtitles give them a voice. I still don't understand why they hate me but I kill them all regardless. I read all about them in my notes but whoever wrote these bios seemed to leave out some rather important bits, like why I care. Still, the pictures are pretty and after I kill them they mingle with my dead boyfriend(?) on the other side. At least they don't talk to me when their dead.\n\nAnd so I drag my very heavy transistor/sword through the sectors annihilating everything in my path stopping occassionally to admire the beauty of the fading world and for a bite of sea monster pizza from Junction Jan's only to recurse and do it again, expect this time... no, I still don't know what's going on...","January 21, 2015","true","17.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","2","2","3","0"

It is a unique rpg that has an interesting balance between turn-based gameplay and real time gameplay.\n\nControls: When I played this, I used the Steam Controller. It wasn’t hard to use at all, and it seemed rather natural to use a controller with the game. Joystick seemed prime for the movement option, and the four buttons on the face of the controller worked really well with the four skills that you have to use in-game.\n\nGraphics: This isn’t a Crysis level of graphics. Coming straight out of an indie studio, it seems unique and more like art. Cut-scenes mix in well with the 2.5D gameplay, and it’s easy to figure out what is happening as time goes on.\n\nMusic: Much like Bastion, Supergiant Games (the creators) release excellent soundtracks and this is no exception. Between the songs that you unlock and Red’s (the Main Character) humming, you find yourself playing the game for the music instead of the gameplay.\n\nOverall: Transistor has a unique and potent combination of great music, easy controls and compelling gameplay, all within a fun game with an interesting plot. No super strategy is needed as you will eventually figure out the game throughout time. I would recommend it at any price, but it does drop down during the sales.","January 19","true","18.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I tracked along the streets of the beautiful town to find that out and soon met enemys, trying to stop me.\nThe combatsystem is really nice, but really interesting for me was how I could change the ensuing fight before it even happens. You can have different abilities with different characteristics.. and switch them around! That way, you can create the set of abilitys that you are most comfortable with to battle. And the battle itself can be altered as well with modifications - some simply strengthen the enemy, others give them shields, but in the end the harder battles will be rewarded with more experience.\nBut the best part of the game are still its graphics, everything is so well made and beautiful. I would have loved to just walk around and look at everything.\nGetting to know the characters even better would have been nice too, but every game needs to end - And this ending.. was a surprise for me.","February 24","true","11.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've been playing video games for a very long time and usually  I am critical enough of the experience to be able to separate myself from it at a certain point. So I say with full weight behind it, that Transistor was able to captivate me enough to marathon through it for close to 8 hours and beat the game in one night. From the very start, the art direction in this game is truly breathtaking. Audio and visual experience for Transistor is unique and consistent in blowing you away (akin to Bastion). Incorporate such a strong and unique Sci-Fi aesthetic into gameplay that not only is fun but actually has strategic dynamic depth throughout the entire experience; you have a game that you simply cannot miss. On the gameplay front, while you are bound to see plenty of Steam guides for ultimate combos (in addition to finding your own), the move system at very least hooks the player for the whole first play though by steadily giving new moves and possible combinations to cater to the player's strategic curiosity. I will end with what has stuck with me the most throughout these past 24 hours of beating the game; that is the fact that Transistor is able to stand on its own ground apart from Bastion, effectively escaping the downsides of comparisons. Instead, I truly feel Bastion and Transistor are complementary masterstrokes for Supergiant's portfolio of games; not tied by any assumed experiential aspects but rather by the greatness in the games alone.\n\n- V\n","May 26, 2014","true","10.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Much like Bastion, there's a theme (sort of) of the world broken, and once again you have the key to piecing things back together. Gameplay provides a very well-done array of ways to approach the enemies, and encourages heavy experimentation until you find something you play well with and like.\n\nWorld design, from art to sound, is once again the shining star in the game. Every detail is gorgeously hand-drawn, every piece of music milking that beautiful neo-noir style for all it's worth. Logan Cunningham's voice work is more expressive and drawing this time around, though every bit as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic as before.\n\nAll in all, a truly wondrous game to behold, one of the very few games released these days which truly have a vision behind them. Its only flaw is that there isn't enough of it to last, but still much preferable to a narrative that drags on.

Players of Bastion may be slightly miffed to hear this as it was certainly the focus of Bastion, tha amalgumation of music, voice acting, art and narrative gave an almost cinematic experience in Bastion that left a lasting impression, and while all of those traits are bought into Transistor and done well, the ambiguity in the story is left for the player to explore, as a reult I found it less satisfying until you uncover as much as you need to in order to really understand the charecetes and events.\n\nWhat I really enjoyed in Transistor was its gameplay, it simply gets better as the game goes on, and its for this reason I see it as a must to at least try recursion, which allows you to unlock all the skills again, making some incredibly powerfull and therfore enjoyable combinations. The game provides the right amount of challenge to force you to explore its brilliant match up system. No combos are bad and any startegy is worth a go.\n\nSpecial mention to the music and vocal work, while the narrative may not be all that impactful theres certainly a strong sense of immersion created through the music and art. Not bad considering they were all recorded in a closet.\n\nI don't know why I wrote a review this long.

Transistor is a fantastic game with amazing soundtracks that you hear throughout the game. The gameplay itself is quite unique but the best way I could describe it is if you had Dragon Age:Origin's ability to stop time and every move or attack you plan,sucked up this time bar that let you stay in that frozen time and after you unleash your barrage of attacks it would just charge back up read for you to use again. This is pretty crucial to most combat in the game so you'll tend to spam it as soon as it comes off cooldown. The story when you first start is pretty confusing and I pretty much had no idea what was going on until I was done with a 1/3 of the game and the game isn't really straightforward with the storytelling so you pretty much have to go through with the tidbits that are given to you at the beginning and just complete the puzzle by either completing files or going through OVC terminals or just listening to what the characters say during their dialogues. The customization allows you to format abilities you can use during a battle, augment those abilities onto another ability that enhances it in some way, or you can decide to augment it onto your body. You can pretty much switch however way you want it anytime during the game provided you get to a terminal which is pretty common throughout the whole game. I was actually impressed with how the game looked overall and it pretty much looked like a work of art, not counting the gameplay aspects or the phenomenal soundtracks. The replayability is pretty much the same as Bastion and it lets you restart over and is called Recursion, keeping your abilitites and level so you can go through the whole game fighting the same late game enemies you would be fighting at the end of the game. Transistor is short, you could probably finish the whole game in around 10 hours but sweet jesus it's 10 really good hours without even touching the Recursion aspect.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SJones/recommended/237930/","SJones","SagaciousJones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SJones/","612 products in account","Transistor blends Bastion’s fast-paced isometric combat with a methodical tactical planning mode to create a unique action system that fits well within its vibrant urban sci-fi setting. You can assign each ability as an action command, a passive bonus, or as an upgrade to another ability, which allows for a vast variety of combinations. This character customization, as well as your options to tweak enemy abilities, provides you significant freedom to tailor your game experience.  Bastion’s combat sandbox and escalating challenge modes return, complementing Transistor’s many avenues for player experimentation. The combat system, however, does significantly favor the planning mode, leaving you relatively weak during the real-time portions while you wait for your planning ability to recharge.  The gorgeous character art and atmospheric music paint a beautiful presentation over the solid gameplay, but the story feels stretched thin as major characters and events receive only minor acknowledgement before moving on. Moreover, the omnipresent narrator says little of value and his comments come across as a scattered stream-of-consciousness in contrast to the wise insight of Bastion’s commentary. Transistor retains many of Bastion’s best elements and distinguishes itself with its unique hybrid action, but fails to entirely match its predecessor’s heights.\n\n4/5 – Really liked it.","October 20, 2014","true","23.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game allowed me to really appreciate a story based single-player game as I was drowned in a breathtaking world with its own unique atmosphere and gameplay.\n\nDuring my first few minutes in to the game, I instantly recognized the amount of work Super Giant Games put into Transistor's presentation. The visual aspect of the game consists of beautiful hand drawn art, a vibrant colour scheme, smooth animation, and excellent character design. The auditory aspect is also just as outstanding as the visuals; the soundtracks consists of a mix of haunting guitar rifts and electronic music which captures the mood of the empty and haunting city of Cloudbank, and the voices and sound effects are also on par with this.\n\nThe gameplay is also unique and makes the game more strategic compared to Super Giant's previous game, Bastion. The turn system allows you to plan your attacks, but there's also a mix of mechanical play with this, such as having to decide the best times to switch to turn mode or real time. I also really enjoyed how the functions worked (which are the skills), as there are thousands of possible combinations as you can use, since you can either use the function as an active, a passive, or you can stack the function on another function to add a unique property.

Most of the time, Transistor is your main weapon and storyteller. Transistor also gives you strong narrative, telling what is going on, and comments on your interaction even each terminal is worthwhile to read.\n\nAs you fight against The Process, the main feature is shined out. Transistor’s combat can split into real-time approach and turn-based approach which give you planning phase to set your position, target, and set of skills. The variety of skill as you progress through the game make Transistor has unique combat and gives player’s choice to try out their own skill build. Even the limiter feature which works like player debuff, and test rooms offer challenge and thinking rather than spamming for win. However, it can be frustrated for cool down after turn mode is used as you may have to run around in small area while some enemies can constantly harm you. It is just minor issue which you can get over with once you get your perfect build.\n\nTransistor is such a unique and great experience. Not just engaging combat, but I fell in love in polished art design, story, and memorable soundtracks which create what people like in the game.

As much as I love the overall aesthetic and atmosphere of the game, I could not get into the combat at all. Unlike Bastion (which was developed by the same company), Transistor suffers from somewhat repetitive combat while enemies lack variety.\n\nWhereas Bastion was more action oriented, Transistor puts emphasis on planning and requires you to pause the battle – i.e. initiate a Turn() –  and queue up your attacks, execute those attacks, and then spend some time running away from enemies during Turn() recovery, until you are able to repeat the process. You wield only one weapon (the sword Transistor) augmented with various functions: you can have up to four functions installed at a time and each can be upgraded with up to two other functions. You can change your functions at every access point (which are save points in the game and are quite frequent) but mostly you find a combination that works and stick with it – since enemies are not very varied, you don't need to change your strategy much between different battles. As a result, the combat starts feeling repetitive.\n\nAnother thing that doesn't work as good in Transistor as it did in Bastion is the narrator. In Bastion he was an omniscient narrator who recounted the protagonist's adventures and described the post-apocalyptic world the game was set in. In Transistor, the narrator is the voice of the protagonist's lover trapped in the sword and his comments are directed at her – and frequently they are reduced to inconsequential passing comments, small talk, comments on whether you've entered some door or what the weather is like and similar. The developers clearly wanted a narrator to accompany you on your journey, but too often he is reduced to just making passing remarks that are in no way necessary, illuminating, witty, etc. As a result, many of his remarks feel superfluous and unneeded. On a second playthrough he becomes downright annoying at moments.\n\nThe narrator would have worked a lot better if only the developers allowed him to talk more about what was happening in the game, about the motives of the antagonists, about past events that took place, about the world of Cloudbank in general. But they made the story purposefully vague, so that you have to uncover it by reading the terminals and the descriptions of the functions, which begs the question – why have a narrator at all?\n\nI wanted to like Transistor much more than I did because the art design and the atmosphere of the game instantly attracted me. The game is absolutely gorgeous looking and at every step I wanted to see more of that world. The story also drew me in right at the start – it started as a murder mystery and I needed to piece together what happened and why, and where my character was even going. A lot of the story is told through terminals you can interact with and through the descriptions of functions, which are not available until you have equipped a function in three slots (active, passive, and upgrade) and used it. However, much is also left unexplained or at least ambiguous, and I'm not sure if this was done on purpose or if it is the result of the fact that not everything can be delivered adequately through terminals and function descriptions.\n\nDespite some of its flaws, Transistor is an interesting game. I just wish I found the combat more fun.","October 23, 2015","true","15.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/waltonky/recommended/237930/","waltonky","Puzzlebox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/waltonky/","318 products in account","This game is a work of art. It has been quite some time since I last played a game that was so capitivating or moving.\n\nFor what it's worth, I have never played Bastion so I won't be able to compare Transistor to it. That said, the game's aesthetics are astounding, both in terms of sights and sounds. The game's story is also very good. It essentially dumps you into the middle of events and you have to unpack it from there, tying most of it up at the end. The game's gameplay is also tied into the narrative in a nice and tight manner. The game mechanics involve using various modules that can be equipped either in active, passive, or upgraded slots. The game encourages experimentation as each module contains lore involving a particular character that can only be unlocked by using it in each of these slots. It incentivizes player experimentation in a keen way, rather than finding one tried-and-true attack. Additionally, if your health depletes in a battle it doesn't seem to outright fail you (at least as far as I've experienced). Instead, it disables one of your abilities and recharges your health. As Two Best Friends put it, it's essentially telling you that whatever you're doing currently isn't working. It's another incentive to experiment.\n\nWe're only halfway through the year, but this might honestly get my choice as the best game of 2014. I look forward to the replays ahead of me.\n\nUPDATE 06/28\n\nSo I thought about this game some more and I want to add another reason why I like this game so much: Red seems like an actual, living person.\n\nThis is done masterfully through small things in the story. The two that stand out for me are the fact that we see her eat pizza and we see her go to use a bathroom. And I mean use *use* a bathroom, not like Silent Hill *use* a bathroom where you stick your arm down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to pull out a wallet. We see her walk into a bathroom, a fade to black with a flush, and the game returns.\n\nThis was endearing to me. Emotions and whatnot go a long way into making a fictional character appear human, but I honestly think it's the small minutiae that ultimately make fictional characters pop to life more. It's not as exciting as drama, but to me it pulses with the true blood of life: the banality of existence. I apprecaited it a lot.","June 25, 2014","true","17.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NabeGewell/recommended/237930/","NabeGewell","moronic piss fiend","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NabeGewell/","187 products in account","I feel like I should actually write a serious review of this game.\nI'll start by saying: If you didn't like Bastion, you won't like this at all. The storytelling is very similar. The game is also pretty short, I finished clocking in at 5 hours (did not 100% obviously, you need NG+ to unlock all the different powers and such). But during NG+, I don't see the story changing much. It will be something for only completionists.\n\nBut, outside of that I found Transistor to be a great experience. Supergiant delivers again with a chillingly beautiful soundtrack, Darren Korb proving his skills at composing. As a person who loved the art style of Bastion, Transistor does not differ a lot from it with the exception of having more "3d" models as compared to the mostly 2D Bastion, this is most easily seen on your protagonist. The voice acting in the game is top notch, Logan Cunningham giving another near perfect preformance on his character and as the narrator. The enviroments are always beautiful to look at, if a little confusing to navigate at times. The story kept me hooked all the way through the game, with the characters being fleshed out along the way, never feeling generic and always very enthralling.\n\nThe combat in the game was a very interesting idea executed well, but not to perfection. It can feel tedious at times and frustrating at others when something just doesn't lineup perfectly. Endgame, you will probably have a combo that will be able to instagib the strongest enemies, you only obstacle being the cooldown bar on your Turn(), which is the main form of combat in Transistor. It's a strategic pause that allows you to set up a bunch of moves that enemies can not react to for the most part. With the backstab mechaninc and the variety of Functions (moves), it has more uses than just being a "VATS" like way of fighting ala Fallout. While recharging, its a game of dodging attacks before you can go back in on the enemies.\n\nWhere the combat really shines is how varried you can make your moveset. Each unlockable function is very different than the last, and aren't just moves: they can be infused to combine with other functions (Example: combine the knockup and the pull functions to create an AOE pull) or can be used as passive traits, all taking up some of your power bar, limiting how many functions you can have going.The stories included with each function are a very nice touch that fit the asthetic very well, but unlocking all 3 pieces can be a pain sometimes, since each one will need to occupy each of the 3 uses (passive, upgrade or move) to unlock the full story. Luckily, you only need one battle in each use to unlock each part and with an upgrade station seemingly after every battle you should unlock them all quickly and be able to go back to a more comfortable moveset.\n\nThere was only a few spots in the game I would consider "hard", for the most part your average player should be able to blow through their first NG with relative ease. The enemies aren't the brightest, not to say that they are bad, but sometimes they will just stare at you as you recharge behind a wall, not even bothering to try and pressure you to move.\n\nDeath is also really hard to achieve, after reaching 0 HP you will get a "free turn()" where you can try and save yourself or win the fight with your what you have left. If you fail and get hit again, you will lose one of your functions socketed. But, since you will usually have 4, chances are you will most likely never lose them all. I have never lost one, so I could not say if they are gone forever, but seeing the difficulty of the game I assume you recover them at the next station. The only time dying will really matter is in the training & challenge areas, where if you die once or twice you may just restart a challenge.\n\nIs it worth playing through?

While the style, both ins visuals and audio, is excellent,the game tries to do too much, and just doesn't succeed.\n\nThe plot is intentionally obscure - in the beginning the player has exactly no idea who's who, where is the plot happening and what are the rules of the world. While the majority of these things are revealed eventually, the player still spends more than half of the game acting without any understanding of what's happening around him, and the eventual revealations just  don't have the emotional significance to justify past obscurity.\n\nBeyond that, the fighting mechanism is novel on paper, but tedious in execution. The player spends half of the time in combat unable to do anything, and the visual obscure such information as where are enemies facing and whether or not certain shots will hit or not.\n\nThe bottom line is an experience which feels like it should amount to a lot of fun, but doesn't really hit the mark it set for itself.","January 30, 2015","false","17.1"," 22 of 42 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","22","42","0","0"

The story is intriguing, the setting is enticing, and the combat is incredibly customizable, but every so often, I was struck by how similar to something in Bastion part of the game felt.  Supergiant did a good job distancing themselves from the ideas they had from their first game for the most part yet certain plot points and game aspects, like the narrator responding to the little things you do and telling the story that way made Transistor feel not quite as fresh as it could have been.  The similar art style and same voice actors certainly didn't help, but Supergiant is a small company, so that's understandable.  Besides, the game does look incredible.\n\nI want to mention the combat again, because it's stellar.  You enter a planning phase, stringing together attacks and movements and then executing them super fast in real time.  Afterwards, you have to dodge enemies' attacks and survive until you can enter your planning phase again.  I'm sure that's not unique, but the fact that your combat abilities are made up of various Functions(), each of which can serve as a primary attack, a secondary modifier, or a passive buff ability, allows you to modify your skill set in an unimaginable variety of ways.  You're even rewarded for switching up your playstyle, since using different Functions() in different ways unlocks backstory about aspects of the world.\n\nThe enemies are refreshing, too, especially when they start to unlock more powerful abilities.  Fetch can go ♥♥♥♥ itself, though.  Those things is super overpowered and I hate fighting them.","February 9, 2015","true","19.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

It was really not until the credits rolled up the screen that I realized that there was no third act, that the boss was indeed the final one, and that there was nothing left to be done.\n\nWhy they made this decision, I do not know.

By allowing the player to respec at every checkpoint, the game allows the player to experiment with this system, which is complex and nuanced enough to give satisfying rewards to experimentation. The best combination I've found so far is void() with purge() and crash() as an opening attack. Limiting the total slots available for attacks forces tradeoffs and compromises that make the process of building and rebuilding Red's skill set continually interesting.\n\nI've finished one playthrough in about 6 hours completing a fair number of the optional test levels. I'm looking forward to playing a new game with more skills unlocked to allow for more experimentation.\n\nThe story is mysterious, but enough hints are provided to make it intriguing. The relationship between Red and the Transistor really carries the game, although it doesn't immediately develop.\n\nThe ability to pause time is a nice inclusion because it allows for a slower, strategic playstyle. I used it for nearly every encounter. Waiting for the cooldown is a drag, but the game thoughtfully allows the player to make tradeoffs to mitigate the cooldown.\n\nLastly, the music and art style are beautifully atmospheric, and I found the voice work solid.","February 10, 2015","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat is very interesting allowing you a very large variety in ways you can set up your skills and combine them to have various and unexpected (or expected) mechanics. The real-time combat is also complimented with a turn base system (reminiscent to Fallout 3's VATS system) where you can freeze time, plan a course of multiple actions and execute them in a blink of an eye chaining powerful moves together and complimenting their attributes to do some serious damage. The story is ok. Like Bastion, you're listening to a narrator who follows your actions on screen and, like Bastion, the world is falling apart and you are trying to undo or fix it whilst it gradually gets a bit clearer on what's happening although, like Bastion, it's never entirely clear and there are loose ends left up to the imagination to fill in.","October 7, 2014","true","25.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Good length, too - each play through (and it's very much worth recursing/game+'ing the game once) takes about 10 hours.\n\nNow, if you're looking for another Bastion, then you may be disappointed. Most of Transistor's combat takes place in a  turn-based mode, where you plan out your movement/attacks, then execute your plan and watch it play out. You can fight in real time (and some of the challenge trials are actually easier this way), but for the most part you'll end up taking too much damage and/or getting knocked out of your attacks to make it a very useful way to play.\n\nDifficulty is great, in that it scales wonderfully. By default, you'll have a fairly easy time killing the Process. However, there are 10 limiters that you can choose, which will make the Process stronger, in exchange for faster leveling up. I can honestly tell you that running with all 10 limiters will make for a very harrowing experience.\n\nAgain, as I mentioned, you should totally play at least twice - first time around gives a good experience, but the second time around - when both you and the Process are leveled up, and you can start stacking functions for extra-brokeness and fun, is what really makes the game.\n\nFinal word - this is the only game that I've gone out of my way to get 100% of the achievements.","November 26, 2014","true","19.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Maybe I have not played many games with complex combat skill system but so far, this function system is top notch. By mixing these function, you have many ways to destroy your enemy and start to make combo out of them. One unique mixed function I use is Bounce function with Spark and Flood upgrade. This upgraded function will bounce around crazy while leaving so many lines that damages your enemy over time. Overall there is so many ways to upgrade and use your functions to match with your play style and still have a lot of function combinations to explore.\nThird, the soundtrack. Arguably the best game soundtrack I have ever heard so far. The music really sets the atmosphere, it is soothing and sometimes intense when the situation has to be. But what is even better is that these soundtrack is still, even more enjoyable, by themselves. I have personally listen to most of the track while I was in "Backdoor" (A special room for you to take a break and try challenges which by the way, a really great way to take break and try different things) and I have stayed there for at least 10 minutes listening to their song. Ashely Barrett, the vocal, and Darren Korb did an amazing job on the sound track.\nThe character and they story is also quite memorable. The main characters, Red and her transistor, have a very heartwarming relationship between each other. Their interaction is innocent and warm. I really liked these characters and the story really shows the growth of the relationship within these two.\nAnd lastly I loved the small lore within the function and limitation. I liked how you were required to use these function to their active, passive and upgrade slot to get more lore about the function's character. I really digged into the characters within the functions. They were intriguing, dramatic and sometimes epic. These side lore were very well done.\n\nThere aren't many disadvantages that bothers me too much but there is a thing that I wished it was improved.\nOne is the replayability and the duration of the game. I have beaten this game for first time within 4 to 5 hours. While it is an indie game and not all good stories have to be long, I kinda wished the story was a bit longer. Maybe I missed the game after finishing it because I loved it so much. This point is arguable to many different gamers out there but for me, I wished it could of gone a little longer around 6 hours.\n\nOverall I highly recommend this game for those who want a breathe of fresh air. This game contains great artistic graphic, amazing music, incredible story and character interaction and extraordinary combat system. I can say this game will blow most of gamers mind or at least be impressed with it.","September 9, 2014","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Before I begin rambling, here's a quick list:\n\n1. This game is short, I probably finished my first playthrough in about 10 hours or so.\n2. Get the soundtrack, you will not regret it.\n3. This game is stunningly beautiful, and if you liked Bastion at all, you'll love this, possibly even more.\n4. The gameplay element to this is fascinating. You can, much like in Bastion, configure and reconfigure your protagonist as you please, taking her attacks apart and putting them back together again just like with sexy, exploding Lego's.\n5. The further you progress through the story the more upgrades and limiters you will choose to unlock.\n6. Limiters can be brutal (I turned 9 on immediately on my second run-through, thinking I was a boss with the NG+ system (New Game+) - No. I was wrong. I was hilariously wrong.\n7. I've heard the first ending isn't really the ending. I would not be surprised.\n8. The pace of the game is very quick, and the only distraction from the story are little rooms you can find to practice different setups and complete challenges. The first ones are easy, but on towards the end of the game the last two stability tests were rather challenging. This game makes you strategize sometimes ;P\n9. Again, this is one of those games this is more about pleasing your senses. Just let it happen.\n10. I would suggesting searching on Youtube the following tracks, and listening to them in this order:\n> Gateless\n> We All Become Instrumental\n> The Spine\n> Vanishing Point Hummed (sounds just like a theme from arguably one of the greatest games of all time and space)\n> In Circles\n\nSeriously. Grand game. SO glad I got it on sale so I could buy the OST as well for the grand total of $10 and some change. Which I then used a gift card for X3","January 4, 2015","true","33.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is one of the most amazing OST's i've ever heard.\nThe beautiful music from Darren Korb combined with the breathtaking voice of Ashley Lynn Barrett can even make the toughest audiophile to cry.\n\nAnd the art style... Just like in Bastion(Also made by Supergiant Games), the artwork looks like i would imagine the concept art for the game! Breathtakingly beautiful!!\n\nThe story is unfortunately very short(probably beatable in 4-5 hours), but beautiful...and very sad... The story about the mute lady and the talking sword went places i couldn't even dream of to begin with.\n\nMany would argue Transistor is too much like Bastion, however Transistor comes with a better and more interesting combat mechanic that Bastion dosen't have.\nYou can pause the combat and enter tactic mode, in which you can combo and use skills to destroy your enemies.\n\nConsequently, Transistor is a visual and musical extravagance and is worth every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ penny you can throw at your screen.

This game runs on the same engine as Bastion, but is very different in several regards.  The combat system is more complex and there is little to no handleholding.  You are encouraged to try different combinations of Functions (skills/abilites) to find what suits you best. The story very good, but is not told nearly as direct as Bastion.  SuperGiant said they were experimenting with new narrative techniques, the best comparison I could use is that the story unforlds like unpealing the layers of an onion.  Here again, the player is given some control over how much of the story they want to delve into.  The ending was also very thought provoking IMO, and overall I think SuperGiant really did a good job here.  I would say this game is at least on par with Bastion.

Sadly, while the graphic style and music is gorgeous, the story and gameplay are lacking cohesion. Similar to Bastion the action is controlled from isometric view and has lots of action rpg elements.\n\nThere is real time combat and a turn mode, which stops the action and allows you to plan moves, which are then executed. Combat in real time is clunky, as the enemies move much to fast to evade, which forces the player into the turn mode. Consequently the game forces hit and run tactics. Stop the action, move close to the enemy, hit him with a few spells and run out of range. Rinse and repeat.\n\nOne of the few good things about combat is the endless combinations of skills you can use. Each of the skills can be used as primary or enhancer of another skill. Sadly, you will end up using the 1-3 heavy hitting spells, without ever experimenting too much.\n\nAll in all the developers did not succeed making this a cohesive game. Graphics and sound are great, gameplay and story telling are lacking. So you find yourself walking down pretty hallways without ever caring about the enemies you kill or knowing what exactly happened in this dystopian world.","May 24, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","7"

Transistor's story is delivered in a fashion only slightly removed from Supergiant's trademark narrated style, and whilst not executed badly it does lack that breath of fresh air that Bastion delivered.\n\nThe characters have their story fleshed out with unlockable text snippets, detailing their lives and events leading up to the start of your playthrough. The odd fallout from this is it almost seems the plot and intrigue has all already unfolded retrospetively; which, when coupled with mining oodles of text and only tenuous explanation of major plot progression, makes for reduced immersion and ephemeral characters.\n\nThat said, you're probably dusting off your hands and thinking "well I guess that's a no to Transistor!". Actually Transistor brings a lot to the table regardless of its weaknesses, like many a classic game. The precise combat mechanics and endlessly customisable skill sets are what makes the title worthy of your valuable gamer hours. The difficulty ramps up at a steady pace, thanks to enemies that scale with your levels, wielding a variety of unique threats. One minute you're master of your art, the next a new contender appears and makes you rethink your style. The replay option keeping all your skill progress is a fantastic feature on top, do try this title if you liked Bastion.","October 11, 2014","true","47.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That was what drew me to this game initially and I wasn't disappointed one bit. Following the footsteps of Bastion, Transistor delivers a similar approach to storytelling in the way the narrator did in Supergiant's previous outing. However I personally prefer this game's method of having a mute main character with a physical manifestation of the "narrator" as a sidekick that's with you at all times. Logan Cunningham does a fantastic job voicing The Transistor, and the relationship between him and main character Red is built gradually throughout. The game finds brilliant ways of allowing Red to communicate with Transistor despite having lost her voice.\n\nTransistor plays a bit like a turn based strategy game but with action RPG mixed in. It takes a bit getting used to at first, but later on it feels really rewarding. You can assign 4 moves that can be executed during your Turn() or downtime between Turns(). You can combine every move for different results, or even assign them to a passive effect. This is what I found most enjoyable about the gameplay in Transistor and I had a blast finding what combinations worked best.\n\nThe one complaint I'd have is that it quickly becomes repetitive. Despite the art direction being absolutely eyecatching, the dull palette can make environments seem samesy at times, and the battle system would  have overstayed it's welcome had the game been any longer than it is.","October 12, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The turn-based/action RPG thing takes some getting used to. Then encounters become almost laughably easy once you understand it and what some of the nastier combos are. - though a brilliant bit of game design makes you try different combinations anyway to unlock more backstory on what's going on. The story is very good and gives you enough information that you generally get what's going on without holding your hand or taking out out of the game for an exposition dump. A few questions remain unanswered, which actually is something I liked - the character spends most of the game on the run from a powerful enemy, so it made sense that I never felt 100% in control of everything. Top notch sound and artistic direction. Between this and Bastion, there may not be anyone that beats Supergiant Games in those departments.\n\nNot everyone will love it, but it definitely has something new to offer and is worth a try.","October 4, 2014","true","19.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The main problem with it is the story because it is told very, very vaguely and you really have to work hard to figure out exactly what is going on. It kinda bothers me because, to me, the story is usually important because it contextualizes your actions within the game. As a result, for those trying to figure out what's going on, part of the experience is lost. However, the combat really makes up for it and the music just sounds fantastic. So, I can safely recommend this game based solely on these two things because that's what I enjoyed the most about it.","October 4, 2014","true","11.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Combines a 1920s theme and a future technology theme that blend together almost perfectly, and is can be seen throughout the game in the numerous splash artworks that are found as you go. The voice actor for the transistor, personally, has the mode captivating voice I have ever heard since Rucks from Bastion. The combat system in the game is well done, and the various abilities and combinations allow for different types of gameplay. It's somewhat of a real-time, yet turn-based method, where you can basically stop time to plan out your attacks. Once you have completed attacking, you must survive the next few seconds until you have a chance to stop time again. The storyline itself is understood as a love story from the beginning, with a tragic end. The music in the game is atmospheric and soothing, and the soft, muffled humming that can be heard in-between turns is possibly my favorite part of the game. I'm hope that they will release a Transistor announcer for Dota 2, because the Transistor's voice is sublime.\n\n10/10, would recommend to anyone.","June 17, 2014","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The gameplay is fast paced while balanced with the "turn()" mechanic allowing you to pause the world and plan out your next set of moves as they play out in a second or two of game time.  There are enough twists and turns in the story and mechanic to keep combat fresh and the backstory is revealed as you mix and match various moves and combos, encoraging experimentation.\n\nAll in all I highly reccomend it.\n\nThere are a few cons to be away of however.\n\nThe first is that as of now the game is a little buggy with the occasional hiccups, but so far I've seen nothing that has caused me to die or loose progress.\n\nAnother issue is its length.  Your $20 will net you roughly 7 hours for your first play through.  While this is a fair trade in my opinion, you still got more for Basition's $15.\n\nThis last issue aggrivates me as someone who shares a computer with his partner.  The game offers no support for multiple saves as Bastion did.  Beyond that, there seems to be no option to start the game over from scratch once you've beaten it.  In order to give my partner a chance to play the game I had to uninstall and reinstall the game, permanently destroying my playthough.  I can only view this design as a way to try and force partners to buy the game twice and is an affont to the concept of social gaming for the sake of nickle and diming their customer.","May 21, 2014","true","43.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Music is solid (beyond solid, it's ♥♥♥♥ing amazing), the art style is gorgeous (sort of what would happen if you took the cel-shaded style of Bastion and crossed it with Art Deco), and the detail is good, but not overdone or too busy.\nThe gameplay certainly won't be for everyone, but I like it. It's an interesting take on a "tactical" style, and the sheer variety of moves and ways to go about doing solving a fight are pretty keen. Lots of abilities to use, and multiple ways to tweak each ability, not to mention passive buffs. All of this while trying to maximize a cap on how much "boom" you can wade into a fight with at once.\nOnly problem I have so far: some bugs definitely made it out of their QA department. Hard-crash bugs. This is a bad thing. It's not hitting everyone, and apparently it's better if you play it in Offline Mode on Steam. I'm guessing Supergiant Games is driving for a fix at the moment, because no studio likes handing out game crashes.\nSo, yeah: I definitely recommend it. It's on the shorter side (haven't beat it yet, but I have a feeling), but beautiful, fun, and has a refreshing take on the mechanics of a platformer. Might just wanna wait a few days for the bugs to get squashed.","May 20, 2014","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ain't so simple with this one."\n\nThat was the first line said in Supergiant Games' debut RPG, Bastion. While the line was definitely fitting for the story of said game, I'd say that it's even more fitting for Transistor, the indie company's sophomore release.\nTransistor starts off with the protagonist, a famous singer named Red, standing over the silhouette of a man who had been impaled by a USB-stick sort of thing known as the Transistor. There is no information as to what lead up to this moment- the game starts here.\nFor the next hour or two of my time in-game, I was constantly trying to imagine what exactly had happened. The game had me lost- in a good way. Transistor's story is, in some senses of the word, all over the place. But it was never too difficult to follow. I've yet to beat the game myself, but with the progress I've made, I'm definitely willing to say that it has one of the best stories out of any game I've played this year.\nAnd where there's a good story, Transistor also brings more good things. A lot of good things, really.\nFor starters, the soundtrack is beautiful. Ashley Barrett, also known as Zia in Bastion, makes her return as the voice for Red- and the songs that she sings are better than ever. From the low humming that plays whenever you're in the Planning phase of combat, to the entirety of The Spine, Barrett is back, and better than ever.\nSpeaking of the "Planning phase of combat," Transistor brings about a new combat system that has been done before, but never quite as well-implemented as it was in Transistor. You can play the game like it's Diablo, sure- but this is incredibly dangerous, difficult, and most of the time, uneffective. The game also features a Planning phase, in which the character is able to move freely about in a frozen world, planning their movements and attacks. Very turn-based in style. Along with this unique combat system, Transistor features countless upgrades, many difficulty mutators in the style of the Shrine from Bastion, and the ability to string attacks together for devastating results.\n\nAll in all, I may be a bit biased towards Transistor, as Bastion is arguably one of the best games I've ever played, but I without a doubt recommend this game. The $20 pricetag stirred me up a bit at first, but I can guarantee that it was worth it. Transistor is definitely an unforgettable experience that I cannot recommend you to buy enough.\nAnd while you're at it, buy Bastion. You won't regret it.","May 21, 2014","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Despite the obvious flaws that the game has, (bugs, crashes, framerate issues) the game is carried by the weight of the story alone. While the gameplay was fantastic, it isn't the greatest video game I've ever played, but it's one of the greatest, if not the greatest, stories I've ever been told. The only thing that truly saddened me with Transistor was the mere fact that I didn't have more time to spend in Red's world. Without a doubt, I would recommened this game to anyone that cares for a story in video games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zedrin/recommended/237930/","zedrin","Zedrin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zedrin/","246 products in account","On its own, Transistor is a solid game with a great atmosphere and world, a very complicated and interesting story, and a very unique combat system. The game features narration by Logan Cunningham, who plays a voice trapped in the Transistor, leading to a lot of real-time commentary on your actions. It's odd but the terms 'action' and 'turn based' simultaneously need to be used to describe the game. The music as well is really good, and is a prominent element to the game.\n\nThis is SuperGiant's second game, their first being Bastion (a must-play, btw). For those who HAVE played Bastion, it'll feel relatively familiar in many respects (such as how the story progresses, Jen Zee's artstyle, etc.), but still unique. Comparatively, both games featured Cunningham as a narrator, though IMO it worked a bit better for Bastion as he was more able to tell a story, almost omnipotent, rather than act as a lone character. This is probably part of why the story is a bit confusing for Transistor.\n\nWhile Bastion's strong point was its narration, where Transistor really excels is its combat system. As I've said, the combat system is very unique. It's a little hard to understand at first but it is incredibly deep and challenging, with multiple setups, perks, and moves that are all balanced very well. The only weak part is the interface used to synergize the skills: it's just as deep and complex as the fighting itself. A slightly clearer interface would greatly help, but you can also overcome this by just gradually memorizing the functions of the skills for when they're applied.\n\nUnfortunately a lot of the additional story elements are in the form of text-based profiles from traces and skills you've acquired, and while it expands the world, setting the time aside to read through the logs for each trace you acquire kinda feels tedious. That said, there's enough explained in the main storyline to understand the world as much as you need to (if you're paying attention), so the logs are more just for additional sustenance. The game also lacks some kind of central world hub: the one they have available is only available at certain times in the middle of missions, rather than a place you return to after each mission. There are some challenge modes available for additional content, and they're worth doing, though I personally am hoping SuperGiant will add in more challenge modes in the future.\n\nThe main storyline isn't too long, will take about 6-8 hours to beat, but it's very rich and fulfilling, and leaves a New Game+ option to experience more of the combat, with a few subtle changes to the story. Overall a worthy second title out of SuperGiant Games.","May 21, 2014","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It takes a bit to get started with it, but once you really start to get the combat down, it goes from being a good game to a great game. The controls are responsive, combat is solid, the music and sound effects are perfect, and so far (I haven't beaten the game yet) the story has been really good.\n\nMy only complaint is that you're limited to eight degrees of movement, and the only reason I have issues with this is that, in a few sections, there are stairwells you have to go up and down that aren't aligned with any of those eight directions, so you end up having to zig-zag on them.\n\nYeah, that's really my worst complaint.

The rest of your remaining abilities can be used to augment the slotted abilities, giving bonus effects or changing the ability altogether. You can swap them around, mix and match and change them as much as you want, to find a playstyle that suits you or just to experiment with new ways to play after every fight, keeping things fresh.\n\nArt style is beautiful: The city looks amazing and intricate. The cutscenes are minimalistic but still amazingly illustrated. It's a very pretty game to look at.\n\nSetting is cool: Futuristic, yet original. It's a city where everything is done by the numbers, to the point where even the sky is painted and the weather is voted on by the residents.  It feels three dimensional.\n\nStory is interesting: It's a game that tells you nothing, but leaves tidbits here and there for you to read so you can put together the bigger picture yourself. It's a little frustrating at times but it keeps you wanting more.\n\nThe music is incredible: When people hark on about a game soundtrack, I usually dismiss it. How memorable can some background music be? Transistor's answer: Phenominal. It fits the game and setting, and like the art style, experiencing it is an absolute pleasure. I've never heard a soundtrack like this before.\n\nShort answer: Buy this game. It's bloody good.","November 1, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Together they battle a digital menace called The Process in order to...\nWell, what do they want to achieve actually? See, Transistor provides two challenges for the player: first, fighting The Process and second, actually understanding what is going on. While some people will hate this minimum style story telling, others will embrace it as another challenge to overcome and will find it very compelling.\n\nCombat, on the other hand, is much more straightforward, deeply strategic and very rewarding. You gain a number of abilities, each of which may be used by itself as an active attack, as support for another ability or as a passive enhancement to your character. Take Bounce, for example. By itself it is an attack that ricochets off enemies, hitting multiple targets in the process. Add it as support to another ability and now this attack will chain-hit. Assign it as a passive enhancement and it will make enemy attacks bounce off of you. Decisions, decisions...\nAdding to that is the Turn() sequence, which allows you to pause the game, queue up attacks and actions, and have them executed in bullet-time. Thus, strategy is much more important than good reflexes.\n\nMost important about Transistor, however, is that it is art. Not art as in the "you might lable this as pre-post-retro modernism" sense. It's art because it's beautiful in every aspect. There is a fundamental aesthetic vision that permeates all elements of the game and strings them together nicely. It just works, and it's gorgeous all the time.\n\nThat being said, not everything is perfect about Transistor. Gameplay generally feels just a little bit rough. Menus like ability selection are somewhat clunky and Turn() can be hit-or-miss without much explanation. The key mechanic for getting more background info becomes somewhat tedious after novelty wears off, paling significantly in contrast to the Turn() mechanic. Some streamlining might have done wonders, but there are limits for indie companies, of course.\n\nNow, Transistor: The Game might have some issues, but Transistor: The Experience is awesome nonetheless. Visuals, soundtrack and voice acting all weave an atmosphere that carries the game over many flaws. What Transistor wants to do, it does really well.\n\nRating: 8/10","July 14, 2014","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Supergiant did it again, and I thing maybe even better. The game runs nicely and is absolutely beautiful, and the soundtrack is once again astonishing. While the game brings a whole new meaning to the 'mute protagonist', all the characters are solid and construct a nice and interesting story, which, I will admit, did make me cry at the end. Gameplay is very nice and satisfying, and I've found in just one playthrough that both paused and not paused combat are quite viable ways to play, if you find the right spot. New mechanics like the triple functionality of the functions and Turn() are very original and well implemented, nonetheless. The map travel system from Bastion was replaced by a continuous world, and all the possible shops had their place taken by a new interface controling every customizeable aspect of your character.\n\nMy only problem with this game is that it was once again too short, but the replay value seems high enough for me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coyoterys/recommended/237930/","coyoterys","Captain Serious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coyoterys/","286 products in account","Transistor is the second game from Bastion developer Super Giant Games, and it is another exceptionally crafted artistic RPG.\n\nIn Transistor you play the role of Red, a beautiful and talented musician who has seemingly lost her voice.  The game begins with Red pulling a sword like device known as the Transistor out of the chest of a dead man.  Immediately the Transistor begins talking to Red as if it knows her.  The voice of the Transistor is how we learn what's going on in this abandoned ghost town of a city called Cloudbank.   Much like the narrator in Bastion comments on the situation of Caelondia, the Transistor will talk to Red about things happening in Cloudbank.  It seems Super Giant Games really has a thing for mysterious apocalyptic events that wipe out flourishing cities.\n\nNot only is the Transistor your talking guide through the game it's also a very powerful tool and weapon.   In the beginning the Transistor only has two functions loaded into it, thus giving you two different attack options.  As you level up you'll unlock   more functions, function upgrade slots, and passive function slots.  The function customization and use is incredibly deep and fun to experiment with as you explore combinations to fit your play style.  It really makes the combat an enjoyable sandbox of trial by fire.\n\nEvery function in the game has 3 optional ways of using it in the Transistor.  The first use is an Active attack and used to directly afflict damage or other debuffs on the enemies.   The second use is an upgrade slot to an existing Active attack.  This will add extra abilities to your attacks.   The final use is a passive slot which will grant you various buffs or abilities that are always active.  With 16 different functions to unlock, and each having 3 ways to potentially use them, you can see the amount of customization gets exponential.  And even more in new game plus when it allows you to unlock another copy of an already used function.\n\nUsing the functions in the variety of ways will also reward the story loving fanatics.  Each function you discover is linked to one pronounced citizen of Cloudbank, and as you use the functions in combat you'll unlock background information regarding their history.  It's a fun way to learn more about the story and reward players for trying new combinations of function loadouts.\n\nWhile the story of Transistor may seem eerily similar to Bastion the combat game play is quite different.  Arguably Transistor can be played in the same real time hack-n-slash style of Bastion, but in all likelihood you'll be using the strategic pause mode for most battles.  This mode feels like a turn based strategy game.   When combat is paused you are shown a progress bar of action points to spend.  Every movement, every function will use up action points until the bar is full.   This allows you to plan out your attack before committing to the plan.  Once you execute a plan you'll see all your attacks played out in real time.  You'll then need to fight in real time as you wait for the cool down timer on strategic mode.  It really is a good balance of real time and turn based combat.\n\nThe thing I loved most about Bastion was it's story, soundtrack and art direction, and once again with Transistor they delivered.   A hauntingly desolate city again brought to life by beautiful landscapes and enchanting music you'll be humming along the way with Red.\n\nWhile it may be relatively short it has replay value in new game plus, just to try more function combos.  If you enjoyed Bastion then you'll find Transistor worthy of a play.","August 15, 2014","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The sound track is just as excellent as Bastion's if not more so. The art style is different but just as good. Everything you liked about Bastion is there and just as good, but different.\n\nExcept the combat. The actual combat itself is brilliant and rewarding, with thousands of possible ability permutations and lacking the feeling that any one combination beats out the others. All the abilities are useful, all of them fun, and all of them let you tackle each fight in a variety of interesting ways.\n\nSome people have complained about the combat in this game, but their complaints are quite bluntly bewildering to me. While it does get increasingly challenging, and dying can be frustrating, I never had to redo any one fight more than twice, and the game autosaves often.\n\nI have not enjoyed a game this much in a very long time. It is exciting to even talk about. This is Game of the Year - or at the very least the Indie Game of the Year.\n\nFor $20 you get around 9 hours of singleplayer content that is brilliantly designed, written, and narrated.\nFor $10 you get a soundtrack that is around 1 hour, 9 minutes of excellent videogame soundtrack.\nIn my opinion you do yourself a disservice not purchasing this game.","May 20, 2014","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat is very interesting allowing you a very large variety in ways you can set up your skills and combine them to have various and unexpected (or expected) mechanics. The real-time combat is also complimented with a turn base system (reminiscent to Fallout 3's VATS system) where you can freeze time, plan a course of multiple actions and execute them in a blink of an eye chaining powerful moves together and complimenting their attributes to do some serious damage. The story is ok. Like Bastion, you're listening to a narrator who follows your actions on screen and, like Bastion, the world is falling apart and you are trying to undo or fix it whilst it gradually gets a bit clearer on what's happening although, like Bastion, it's never entirely clear and there are loose ends left up to the imagination to fill in.","October 7, 2014","true","25.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think the problem that most people are seeing is that they wanted a Bastion 2, instead they got a completly diffrent game. The gameplay is fun to learn and use well, as if you make a mistake you're punished for it. Darren Korb has outdone himself, and Ashley Barrett has the voice of a goddess. Another problem people see is that you have to find the story for yourself. You can't just walk through everything and have the story layed out for you, you have to try new weapons and combinations, you have to search every alley, and even if it's only for a little remark made by the Transistor, it helps bring the world together. I can see how the game isn't for everyone, some people don't want to explore just for tiny remarks, or read about how the Antagonists chose certan people to make "disappear" and why those people were chosen. This game isn't a new Bastion, not by a longshot. Once you realize and accept that then the game really shows it's true colors. I would reccomend this game to almost everyone, but explain what kind of game it is.\n\nTL;DR: The music is a treat. The gameplay is a treat. The art is a treat.

But the gameplay here is a lot deeper and richer, so it's worth a look even if you didn't care for Supergiant's previous effort.\n\nSimilar to Bastion, the story is simple but beautifully presented. The futuristic/maybe-computerized city of Cloudbank is a visually lush setting for monster bashing, and the snippets you find and decipher throughout the game paint a unique portrait of the city's history and the villain's motivations. It's easy to get drawn in, even if, from a player's perspective, you're just running around murdering everything in your path.\n\nIt probably helps that your rampaging is so enjoyable. Combat is real-time, but you can periodically freeze time to cue up a string of commands as if it were turn-based. That combined with the incredibly flexible system of combining your power-ups into increasingly elaborate attacks opens up a tremendous number of options, both on-the-fly and in terms of your overall playstyle. Want to kite around and chip away at range? You can spec for that. Want to play fully real-time as a bruiser? Sure. Want to mind control everyone into killing each other? Go for it. Run around unleashing monster turn-based combos whenever you can? Yessir.\n\nIf anything, the biggest problem is that the mechanics are SO flexible that it gets daunting. Thankfully, there are a handful of mechanics that guide you towards new combinations (avoiding the Diablo 3 "here is a new option that you have no reason to care about" issue) and, like Bastion, the game's difficulty is rather forgiving but has options for you to increase it on the fly.\n\nBut bottom line, this is beautiful, enjoyable, and distinct experience that doesn't overstay its welcome.

You discover what items and abilitys do, and how you get them, each with a unique story, ultimately adding to your discovery of the story line. The gameplay is increadibly unique and fluid, with a fair amount of stratagy laid in to it.

Not without flaws though, and not up to the high bar the group set previously with Bastion. Combat is weighted too heavily on use of Turn() movements, and it is straight up impossible to beat the game in only real time combat, unlike what Supergiant said during events like PAX. The game is far more linear than it should be, with almost no splitting off. Additionally, you are given a lot of customization with how you use your skills, but it will always boil down to what does the most burst damage at the time, since you can only effectively fight in Turn(). As such, it has very little replayability, since there is not going to be any variance in order of area completion or how you play the game, unlike Bastion. Lastly, enemies to far, far too much damage, the other reason open combat outside of Turn() isn't feasible. After the halfway point of game, most enemies will take well over half your HP in one attack or combo, and the AI is exceptionally aggressive and tracks movement during thier shots.\n\nDespite all this negatively, the game is still good. Art style is great, story is unusual but interesting, music is solid (though personally find it inferior to Bastion's western styling) and gameplay is mostly enjoyable. It may not be exceptional, but it's still above the average of most AAA releases these days.","May 23, 2014","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although I'm still completing the game, this is quickly rising on my favorites list. The music is fantastic, the art is gorgeous, and I never realized how much I could care about a fictional sword until Transistor.\n\nAdding to original:\nI'm almost 19 hours in at this point, and still on my second playthrough. Granted, some of these hours come from me being afk and leaving the game running. I know people that have completed the game in less than 5 hours or so, but I just keep taking time to read each bio, complete each achievement, and generally replay the game. My second playthrough is just as good (perhaps better, now that I know the story and can pick up on more subtext) as the first.\n\nThis is, all in all, a very excellent game. The soundtrack is just as wonderful as the game. Art is wonderful, gameplay is very much dependent on your cycle - my first playthrough, I relied very heavily on a feature called "Turn". Turn pauses the game and allows you to plot out each action. On my second, I've been relying much more on live play and slotted skills accordingly.\n\nHonestly? Buy this game. You won't regret it.

First, the visuals are quite stunning and appealing.  Second, the narration is excellent.  Third, the protagonist is mute.  Fourth, the story is always compelling you forward.  Last, the story is, sadly, on the short side (around 6 hours if you skip the optional trials), but it's still an excellent story; I'd much rather an amazing, compelling short game than a longer game that loses its direction, or my interest, along the way.  In addition to all of that, the game includes an excellent combat system and the voice acting overall is very well-done, and kudos to SuperGiant Games for doing what much larger studios fail at accomplishing - NPCs that drive the plot forward while talking just the right amount in well-acted voices.\n\nThe story puts you in the role of Red, a singer who has lost her voice and wields The Transistor, a talking circuit sword.  Much like Bastion, its predecessor, you travel around the world battling bad guys while trying to figure out what happened and how to stop it.\n\nWhile fighting The Process, you get the pleasure of enjoying the battle system, which is quite well-done.\n\nFirst, you may have up to four abilities hotkeyed to your active ability bar.  Each ability has one power-up slot, which can be used to make the ability more powerful in various ways depending on which power-up ability you choose.  As you level up, you unlock more abilities, more power-up slots, and more passive slots.  You can then take all of the abilities you have at your disposal and mix and match them in a myriad of ways to make a style that is both fun for you and powerful enough to get the job done.  Your choices are only limited by the abilities you choose to unlock and how much memory you have available (which can also be increased as you level).\n\nSecond, during combat you have the option of real-time or strategic combat.  You can run around the screen using your abilities live as they come off cooldown if that's your thing, or if the combat is especially easy, or you can choose to enter strategic combat and plan out an effective attack sequence and aim your abilities in the most advantageous ways.  However, the strategic combat option has a cooldown every time you use it, during which many of your abilities will be unavailable, so in between strategic rounds you'll need to become adept at evasion.\n\nLast, if you find things too easy, you will unlock limiters as you level.  You can activate these limiters to make combat more difficult, and also to earn more XP from each battle.\n\nIf you enjoy RPGs, action-adventure, mystery, and/or strategic combat, then you have a reason to play this game, because it delivers all four in a well-balanced mix.","January 18, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you're familiar with Bastion, you are likely to recognize Supergiant's atmospheric touch in this game.  This game is shorter and has a less fleshed out plot.  Like Bastion, mysteries are left to your imagination, unanswered.  However, the brevity of this game will leave you wishing there were more mysteries to boggle over.\n\nThe combat is moderately strategic.  If your mood is too specific, you might be disappointed, whether you're looking for simple combat or serious strategy.  It has more of a balance between simplicity and strategy. It's fun for what it is.\n\nReplay value is mildly elevated by the New Game+ style recursion mode.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game.\n\nPros:\n-The music and other atmospheric elements are exceptional.  Supergiant sets a high standard for game atmosphere.\n-The main gameplay mechanic is fun and allows for experimentation with the various function (skill/upgrade) combos.\n\nCons:\n-As stated above, the game is shorter than I'd like (needs more plot points).","January 3, 2015","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/everywordadefiance/recommended/237930/","everywordadefiance","Prospero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/everywordadefiance/","88 products in account","Transistor is an original, intelligent and lucid action RPG.\n\nThe game revolves around Red, a singer whose voice was stolen by the Camerata, a group of individuals determined to Process a city that serves its people. Without formally identifying or constructing her as so, Red is presented as a strong female protagonist; this means she is without any of the clichés that so often inhibit this archetype. Supergiant masterfully pulls off a plot that gives her agency and the ability to sculpt a world inhabited by a cast of colourful characters whom the player learns about through the Functions() of the Transistor. The diversity of the characters, in particular, is to be commended: there are black and mixed-race, gay, lesbian and transgender characters.\n\nThe Function() system is at the heart of the game; it allows the player to combine different attacks and abilities in either primary, upgrade, or passive slots, resulting in a unique experience with approximately 22bn different combinations to be had. The system encourages experimentation, and so leads the player in to a kind of exasperating perfectionism: you want to get your loudout exactly right. The mix of frantic, fast-paced real time action and the suspended realm that Turn() provides to plan a sequence of moves is something quite unique and, surprisingly, it doesn't get tiresome. The enemies are varied enough to keep the battles interesting; they regularly upgrade themselves to match your own increasing prowess and there are enough different kinds to always provide a challenge.\n\nThe soundtrack is both touching and transcendental; it encapsulates the changing pace of the game, from the arid mystery of a deserted Cloudbank at the beginning to the decaying ruins of a Processed world at the end. The mixture of electronica-esque synths, ambient Portal-like sounds and well-timed guitar riffs give suitable gravitas at just the correct moments. The music feels alive; it actively changes as you switch between states and the Turn() mode.\n\nIt's the little things in Transistor that really complete it. Flavour text is what drives the realism and the allusions to software and programming are delightful to see. The different chapters of the plot and the scenes are strung together well enough so the entire game flows. Romanticised additions like the motorbike and the posters add a sense of fun  to the game and an importance to the role that Red has.\n\nThe most striking element of the game is probably the artwork; the visuals are stunning and utilise different hues, colours, art styles and changes in lighting to illuminate Cloudbank. Cloudbank is a city inside a computer, but it feels very much real. The nuanced dichotomy of an organic, breathing world that is seen through the window of Red and the basic binary foundation that underlies the entire premise is linked delicately with endless, gorgeous pieces of artwork and cutscenes and this is remarkable.\n\nWhat makes Transistor a gem is the seamless integration of the idiosyncratic creativity of these elements -- music, artwork, plot and mechanics -- that would only be expected to find in the most successful of indie games, with the overall polish that usually only blockbuster games can pull off. The entire game has a glistening shine that suceeds in being both immersive and compelling, pulling the player into the digital utopia of Cloudbank and refusing to let them go. Certainly a niche game, but it can't be recommended enough.","August 1, 2014","true","26.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Enemies are varied and interesting, each having a different optimal strategy to be defeated without feeling like a gimmick, and the tactical dimension of combat added by the Turn() system is not to be underestimated.\n\nThe game-world of Transistor and atmosphere are exquisite, not the least because of the stunning visuals and bold sound track. The city of Cloudbank is beautiful and feels alive and ripe for exploration. My only complaints lie in the delivery of the game's plot line: Transistor errs a little too heavily on the side of the player filling in the blanks. While I love deducing things about a game's greater environment, the primary plot occasionally required a lot of out-of-game legwork to just feel coherent.\n\nAll in all, I would certainly recommend Transistor. It's a delight to play and explore, and a very worthy successor to Bastion.","August 1, 2014","true","31.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The soundtrack of Transistor is just as good as Bastion. The only thing is it is very short. Only about 6-8 hours of gameplay which is shorter then Bastion. And as for the story, without any spoilers, it made me cry. The ending was simply beautiful. In the dark world that became of Cloundbank (the city in Transistor) the ending made you feel warm, happy and then you cried. Better then Bastion? The more I think about it the more I think it is.

The story and music may not be as good, but the art and gameplay are even better somehow. Go go go.\n\nFor everyone else: Transistor is an absolute blast. The mix-and-match nature of the combat system leads to all sorts of fun experimentation. The semi-turn-based nature is also unlike anything I've never played before, and that alone makes this game worth trying out. It takes a bit for things to really open up, as you have very few powers for the opening bits of the game. But once you've got a sizable arsenal, this game shines like a diamond.\n\nThe setting and story are delightfully unusual, but immediately familiar to anyone who enjoyed Tron or Reboot. Supergiant still knows how to make a wonderful soundtrack, and Logan Cunningham is a welcome return as the voice of the eponymous Transistor.\n\nSo what's not so great? The back quarter of the game does drag a little bit, and if you want more info on the world than what the story offers you, prepare to do an awful lot of reading of people's bios in menus. And while the general storyline and ending are fine, they do leave a lot up to guesswork and interpretation. That's not to say it's too complex, just that I was left wanting to know a bit more.\n\nTwenty bucks may be a bit high for some, as the game can be beaten in a few sittings. On the other hand, it also means the game is very tight. There's little wasted space, and there is a "new game+" feature if you're just not done once you're done. I highly, highly recommend this game to just about anyone, even if action games aren't normally you're thing. The combat is very adjustable to be as forgiving or brutally punishing as you like, and the turn system often makes it as much about thinking through a problem as about running around like a maniac.","August 3, 2014","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sapphire475gs/recommended/237930/","sapphire475gs","Saphyr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sapphire475gs/","127 products in account","Personal Evaluation: My favorite "Za Warudo" power fantasy since F.E.A.R., SUPERHOT, and SSBB.\n\nThe Objective: This third-person game is a mix of real-time and turn-based tactical action using a move selection and modification system that allows for many different play styles.  Functions, which can function as moves, mods, or passive buffs to the player, are aqcuired in the first story run and by leveling.  Applying these requires "memory", which you can also eventually expand by leveling.  Functions vary in utility from mobility to buffs and debuffs to damaging attacks and have various tactical effects depending on how they are applied.\n\nExecuting moves outside of Turn(), the time-stopped mode where enemies are frozen to allow you to plan out a set of attacks, can be time-consuming in comparison to the Turn()-based execution unless the appropriate mod is applied.  In Turn(), your planning potential is aided by a flexible and calculated system where you can erase your moves to select a different one and see how much damage your actions are expected to incur on the enemy (emphasis on "expected", as some enemies can turn or teleport from backstab attempts that amplify damage).\n\nSimilar to its predecessor, Bastion, the game features isometric elements, a "sandbox" where you can enter challenge doors or listen to the game's soundtrack (unlocked by completing challenges), and "recursive" gameplay (i.e. a New Game+ mode).  Unlike its predecessor, Transistor employs a death machanic that raises stakes without immediately ending a run.  Losing your entire health bar will disable one of your active functions (and, while not disabling them too, uninstall any mods applied to it), reducing tactical options for the round.  The function is recovered after getting through an additional round of enemies once your current round is resolved, and in the meantime, you are able to equip a new function in place of what was lost.  Losing all functions in a single round, while I have not experienced it, presumably results in necessarily restarting the round.  Retrying a round is also possible from the menu screen upon pressing Esc or your controller equivalent.\n\nThe Subjective: I enjoy the mix of thinking on my feet to reach my Turn() with minimal health loss and planning out insane combos of moves in time-stop.  While it didn't happen often in the main story, losing functions got me to improvise, engaging me further in strategy and tactical consideration.  It is in the New Game+ Performance challenges that this need to improvise and find ways to reach Turn() without dying is magnified, as you gradually get access to functions and memory from a significant limitation, but losing them results in their complete disappearance; I found this challenge mode in particular to be the most difficult, but also the most informative with regards to how the functions can operate together.\n\nWhile you may desire to stick to some basic combinations, the game's challenge modes will present you with a variety of possible movesets that will work to great effect.  For me, it was a thrill to home in on my own hand-crafted deadly set of fuctions for the really stubborn enemies, but, even if I were to lose all but one of them, I still know several other options that will fit into place once I reach an access point to apply new functions.\n\nThe story is pretty damn melancholic in its overall scope.  The destruction of the city at the hands of the enemy you encounter is not unlike what you see in Bastion, except that instead of the world having fallen apart, it is being remade to an unfamiliar and uninhabitable form.  The aeshetic of the established society reminds me much of the 1920 in the US, and its collapse, perhaps not coincidentally, seems to me to reflect how that prosperous decade would end... but that's just interpretation.\n\nParting Words: I love being mean.","August 3, 2014","true","18.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was a truly fantastic game, on par if not better in its own way than Bastion.\n\nThe story interested me and held my attention throughout, especially with the way it tells itself through the narration and environment. The music and art style were absolutely beautiful as I'm sure you will hear many people say. The combat felt fresh to me, easy to get a grip on but nothing I've ever really seen before.\n\nThe only nitpicks I have with the game are:\nA) The boss fights are dreadfully easy once you get a hang of the game.\nB) There is a certain enemy type towards the end of the game that felt really cheap to me (though that may just be because I was worse at the game than I thought).\nC) I'm not sure how I came under the impression, but I thought "Recursion Mode" (New Game+) would include extra story elements or different dialogue in certain areas. After a bit of research after finishing the game, I discovered it was nearly all enemy layouts and enemy difficulty and such, much to my dismay. Though if you're into the combat, I suppose that's not really a negative.\nD) My game crashed. Once. In a challenge map. Before it began. After the game saved. No biggy, but something to watch out for.\n\nOverall, absolutely amazing game that will stick with me for a while, and may very well become one of my favourite games. I whole-heartedly recommend buying it, especially if you enjoyed Bastion. Even if you didn't, buy it anyways, Supergiant deserves all of your money.\n\n10/10 would bang, play, finish, get upset by, reason with myself so I stop getting upset by and then write a review that got way longer than I intended again.","May 26, 2014","true","18.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well into new game plus, I'm still experimenting with the gameplay, finding new combos. Let me explain the gameplay first.\n\nYou unlock 16 skills throughout the game. These 16 skills can be used as 4 primary skills, 4 passive skills, and each primary skill can get up to two skills "supporting it" to alter or enhance the skill. Any skill obtained can be put in any of the slots, which allows for an endless array of customization. I'll try to sum up an example-- there's a dash skill. There's also a skill that pulls enemies to the user. So, I use that to support the dash skill. Enemies are now pulled to the location where I dash from. So, I summon a triggerable bomb before I dash. Enemies and the bomb are all drawn into the same location. I use another skill to detonate the bomb from a distance. Enemies drop.\n\nThere are many other combinations I haven't touched on, or even discovered. But there is a need to discover these kinds fo clever combos when the enemies get tougher-- and they do. Especially with optional limitiers enabled. These limiters increase damage enemies do, cause more to spawn, as well as a variety of other negative consequences. Never unfair, but always challenging. Think similar to those totems in Bastion.\n\nAs for the story-- it's really good. There's enough presented to you to have emotional affects on you, but there's a Dark Souls-esque deal with reading into the "lore" of the game presented through paragraphs of information given to you from abilities, limiters, and etc. It works whether or not you read up on it, but you won't understand the full thing unless you read, most likely. The voiceacting has no flaws that I can call out, every voice-actor is superb. Especially Royce and the narrator. (Which are really half of the game's voice actors, but still.)\n\nThe music? It's good. A little subtle most times, I only found myself openly digging the music during combat during an early bossfight, otherwise the music was relatively in the background. However, the more I use limiters that cause battles to become more hectic, the more I notice intense music. Still, it could've been more prominent.\n\nOverall, it's an amazing game. Completely worth the price. Again, I finished the game in eight hours. But there's more to do in the new game plus mode. Enemy spawn locations and patterns are random, there's new elements to the story, and so on.\n\nIt's a great game overall, and I see myself putting much more time into it.","May 24, 2014","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have a number of skills that can be either used as a primary skill (like hit 'em with the sword, or shoot a bolt of energy at a distant foe), or they can be slotted into a different primary (like add damage, or AoE to some other skill), or they can be used to provide a more general buff (you have a damage shield, or all backstabs do more damage).

Even if were to lack the the intriguing gameplay and narrative, I would still have loved this game sheerly for its look-and-feel. The art is just so good; I have never taken so many screenshots! The gameplay is fittingly unique: You obtain Functions, which can behave as an active skill, as an upgrade to another skill, or as a passive upgrade. Each Function is derived from a character in the narrative, and to learn all there is to learn about that person, you need to use the Function in all three ways. It encourages experimentation with the mechanics, which can bring surprising results, even if you've settled on a favourite combo. The narrative, subtle and minimalistic, is frankly heart-warming. The world building is outstanding, and I often found myself wanting to rent an apartment in High Rise. The narration doesn't work quite as well as it did in Bastion, but there's just so much more to this game to be bothered by it. Clocking in at around 8 hours for me, Transistor is a fine gaming experience that doesn't overstay its welcome.

Good length, too - each play through (and it's very much worth recursing/game+'ing the game once) takes about 10 hours.\n\nNow, if you're looking for another Bastion, then you may be disappointed. Most of Transistor's combat takes place in a  turn-based mode, where you plan out your movement/attacks, then execute your plan and watch it play out. You can fight in real time (and some of the challenge trials are actually easier this way), but for the most part you'll end up taking too much damage and/or getting knocked out of your attacks to make it a very useful way to play.\n\nDifficulty is great, in that it scales wonderfully. By default, you'll have a fairly easy time killing the Process. However, there are 10 limiters that you can choose, which will make the Process stronger, in exchange for faster leveling up. I can honestly tell you that running with all 10 limiters will make for a very harrowing experience.\n\nAgain, as I mentioned, you should totally play at least twice - first time around gives a good experience, but the second time around - when both you and the Process are leveled up, and you can start stacking functions for extra-brokeness and fun, is what really makes the game.\n\nFinal word - this is the only game that I've gone out of my way to get 100% of the achievements.","November 26, 2014","true","19.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This was recommended by my friend because he told me that Supergiant, who also made Bastion, is developing this game. I did try Bastion but only in demo version. I liked the game Bastion so I decided to try their new game, Transistor.\n\nFirst off, the game's artistic like graphic had amazed me. I have not seen a game beautiful and artistic like this game (Maybe comparable to Bastion). The artistic graphic really set up the environment and atmosphere like no other game I have seen. The game is gorgeous to look at.\nSecond, the "Function" system is quite unique (I meant the way you mix function to make even more powerful and unique function or ability). Maybe I have not played many games with complex combat skill system but so far, this function system is top notch. By mixing these function, you have many ways to destroy your enemy and start to make combo out of them. One unique mixed function I use is Bounce function with Spark and Flood upgrade. This upgraded function will bounce around crazy while leaving so many lines that damages your enemy over time. Overall there is so many ways to upgrade and use your functions to match with your play style and still have a lot of function combinations to explore.\nThird, the soundtrack. Arguably the best game soundtrack I have ever heard so far. The music really sets the atmosphere, it is soothing and sometimes intense when the situation has to be. But what is even better is that these soundtrack is still, even more enjoyable, by themselves. I have personally listen to most of the track while I was in "Backdoor" (A special room for you to take a break and try challenges which by the way, a really great way to take break and try different things) and I have stayed there for at least 10 minutes listening to their song. Ashely Barrett, the vocal, and Darren Korb did an amazing job on the sound track.\nThe character and they story is also quite memorable. The main characters, Red and her transistor, have a very heartwarming relationship between each other. Their interaction is innocent and warm. I really liked these characters and the story really shows the growth of the relationship within these two.\nAnd lastly I loved the small lore within the function and limitation. I liked how you were required to use these function to their active, passive and upgrade slot to get more lore about the function's character. I really digged into the characters within the functions. They were intriguing, dramatic and sometimes epic. These side lore were very well done.\n\nThere aren't many disadvantages that bothers me too much but there is a thing that I wished it was improved.\nOne is the replayability and the duration of the game. I have beaten this game for first time within 4 to 5 hours. While it is an indie game and not all good stories have to be long, I kinda wished the story was a bit longer. Maybe I missed the game after finishing it because I loved it so much. This point is arguable to many different gamers out there but for me, I wished it could of gone a little longer around 6 hours.\n\nOverall I highly recommend this game for those who want a breathe of fresh air. This game contains great artistic graphic, amazing music, incredible story and character interaction and extraordinary combat system. I can say this game will blow most of gamers mind or at least be impressed with it.","September 9, 2014","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Good soundtrack? Check. Logan Cunningham providing yet another good voice for a character? Check. Story and combat to keep you glued to your screen? Check. My only gripe? The short, yet sweet storyline. Lasting for only around 4-6 hours, it's quite an enjoyable experience albeit short and slightly expensive (although I consider that $20 paid for itself). I suggest getting it on sale for a lower price, but even with a high pricetag it's well worth it on its own. If you want to support the devs even more, grab the soundtrack. It's amazing.\n\nFinal Verdict: Solid 8.5/10. It has its rough edges and it's obviously not a perfect game.
