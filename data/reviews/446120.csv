"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldershot/recommended/446120/","aldershot","[F!] Aldershot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldershot/","2454 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBunker Punks is an interesting blend of classic FPS mechanics and modern Roguelikes.\n\nLike FPS of old, there is no reload, no regenerating shields, and no iron sights. It's pure run and fun goodness. It even features graphics that is very close to it's inspiration. The enemies, props, and items are all 2D sprites in a 3D world, even the textures are pixelated to match the feel of classic FPSs such as Doom, or Wolfenstein. Of course all of this is presented within a roguelike format. Randomly generated maps, loot, and permadeath is some of it's key features.\n\nI would probably call Bunker Punks a rogue-lite over roguelike because like other rogue-lites, such as  Rogue legacy, there will be upgrades that you can unlock that will carry over to the next playthrough. Such as new items that could potentially drop, extra bunkers, or new characters.\n\nThe gameplay itself is pretty simple. Run and gun your way through a connected map, looting and shooting your way into riches. Collect cred, and tech to upgrade your bunker, and collect items to upgrade your characters. There will be multiple weapons available to unlock and pick up and even multiple characters to try.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_UmpYhA3q8\nThe game plays well enough, but it's not perfect. There are definitely things I'd like to see added or improved on. It's nice the game has variety of characters to play as, but since it's only their base stats that differentiate each other, and since you can customize your load up and pick ups, they all end up playing exactly the same, especially at later parts of a run. I'd also like to see more enemy and environment variations, as of this current review, the RNG does cycle through a lot of the same material over and over again. Another addition I'd really like to see added is secret rooms. Finding secret rooms were some of the best parts of those old FPSs, and it's a shame it's not in Bunker Punks.\n\nOverall Bunker Punks is a well conceived blend of classic FPS with roguelike elements. It's fast paced, challenging, and plays and feels just like it's inspirations. Many of my critiques are fairly minor and easily addressed in future updates, at least let's hope they do.\n\nPros:\n- Very good representation of classic FPS\n- The genre blending is handled well\n- Fast paced and challenging\n- Good upgrade system\n- Addictive\n\nCons:\n- Character selection is bland\n- More variety in enemies and environment needed\n- Needs secret rooms","March 30","true","7.7"," 48 of 61 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","48","61","0","3"

While at face-value there are some rough edges and room for improvement, it is very addicting. And thats great - because its Early Access!\n\nOne thing to make clear that the store page sort of misleads - this is not a base-building game. The 'base-building' elements are simply leveling up your guys (as far as I have seen). There isn't really any management involved. The 'base-building' is another way to implement a skill tree. Its great, just know what you are in for.\n\nEssentially, you can hold two weapons at any given time, and are gun-blazing through randomly generated levels. Harder levels have more floors. After you complete a level, you return to your base to spend the loot to upgrade your guys. There are meta-game upgrades that really adds alot of replayability and keep you coming back. This feels like the best of Doom IMO.\n\nPros:\n+The FPS elements are done really well. Plays really smoothly and is hella fun. They keep it simple with only two weapons, which works very well here.\n+Pixel art is a mixed bag here - when its great its great, but some stuff needs further refinement (like walls and redundant posters, among other things).\n+Voice acting is good (but, I mean, who cares really - it could have just been left out given there is so little of it).\n+Its definately a cool new take on roguelites.\n+Music is definately good.\n+Its quite addicting!\n\nCons:\n-Having randomly generated levels isn't always a good thing. Yeah it adds 'infinite replayability', but in this case I'd rather have a good handful of crafted levels. They are all boring. Its just boxes connected by crappy hallways that the enemies have a lot of trouble path-finding through.\n-Environment needs a bit more detail. A bit more 'character'. Maybe better use of lighting. Everything feels like boxes connected by hallways at the moment.\n-The $15 price tag may be a little steep right now, but I definately will keep the game (which says something).\n\nYeah, I am really enjoying the game, so far. I hope developement and refinement continues at a good rate.","March 31","true","5.9"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","30","40","0","2"

Shane Neville is an independent video game developer and artist living in Vancouver, BC, Canada. He develops games under Ninja Robot Dinosaur Entertainment. The reason that he named his company this is because his games often feature ninjas, robots and/or dinosaurs. In this instance robots feature heavily.\n\nBunker Punks is a retro FPS that features roguelike and basebuilding mechanics. The FPS action is an instant reminder of some of the classic FPS games from gaming’s past including the early DOOM and Quake games. However, intelligently designed procedural generation, permadeath and the customization of roguelikes have been incorporated into the game.\n\nPlayers can expect to find the action to become increasingly difficult due to its frantic high-speed action and enemies that can truly be sponges. I accept that some players don’t appreciate ammo sponges with enemies that require you to unload entire clips on a single enemy but I believe that it is well suited to the game. This ultimately means that players will have to strategize on many of the game’s enemies including on the best way to use the environment to your advantage.\n\nOne of my favorite features in the game was the bunker building aspect of the gameplay. It adds a tremendous level of depth to the game and provides the necessary tools to differentiate the game from much of its competition. Players can enable new abilities in order to strengthen their punks. The non-linear skill tree also offers a level of customization not often seen in games within the genre. It’s a well considered and thoughtful approach that makes no two games the same.\n\nI also enjoyed the pixelized graphics and thought that the music composed by Gordon McGladdery and Réal Cardinal was also well thought out and inspired. This flows through to the in game audio developed by Power-up audio. Everything is designed to fit nicely and encapsulate the intended atmosphere.\n\nUnlike many other early access games there is no intention to raise the price of the game as it leaves early access but for FPS fans this is a game that you will want to get in early and provide feedback on to inspire the changes that will make the game even better. It is already an intelligently designed game that has consistently incorporates the feedback of its player base. It’s a sleeper hit and one of the best Steam debuts that I have come across. A very easy recommendation.\n\nFor more reviews and our popular giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com.","May 2","true","12.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Then add in the mini base building, upgrades, and minor character customisation via weapons and armour pieces and you have all the makings for great fun.\n\nIt's rare to get get an FPS that has some proper twitch controls, but that have the weapons, enemies and impact to make it all fit.\n\nThere are several characters/punks in the game, and you unlock them, along with further base upgrades via Tech you acquire when raiding corporate facilities. Each Punk have their own weapons they specialize in, meaning you can tailor the base to them. Buying specific upgrades that give them bonuses, or you can go for an all round good team.\n\nSo far though, it seems the only way to get to buying new Punks or upgrades is via the desert salesman, and I've only encountered him after dying, not much of an issue as when you're on a roll you're on a good role.\n\nI'd happily recommend the game to any FPS fan that likes a good twitch shooter and some retro graphics.\n\n\nPC Gameplay and Mechanics\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ug9cXfm6ok","March 30","true","0.9"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","20","33","0","0"

I completed the game in that amount of time, and I was playing slowly. It's a good early access title, because it's playable and enjoyable, but $15 is a lot to ask for six hours of content for a rogue-lite game.

Check that out if you like this. What they have is basically a full game.\n\nVerdict: Purchase ONLY if you want to support this developer. Otherwise wait, but do purchase it when it comes out if they've added about ten times the content. This is more of a demo than a game. That's fine for early access.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/graystillplays/recommended/446120/","graystillplays","GrayStillPlays","http://steamcommunity.com/id/graystillplays/","42 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe review is quite long and in depth.  If you're a more visual person, or prefer to just listen to it instead of reading, I've done a video version here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvAwynhqThU\n\nOne look at Bunker Punks will have FPS gamers of old immediately drawn into a nostalgic fantasy world where Wolfenstein 3D is still top seller, and gameplay is more about the immediate action than the item or inventory management.  There are plenty of ways to make a game unique by making it more complex, but its when you boil a gaming genre down to it's roots, add a few bits and pieces, and make those pieces work and function incredibly well when you know that you have the building blocks for an excellent game.  Bunker Punks is such a game, and even in early access it proves that you can give the people something solid, and still leave plenty of room for additions and improvement.  In this review, we'll be looking at Bunker Punks in three categories, Gameplay, Sound, and Look.  Our typical Polish category is removed due to the game being early access.  Each category will take into consideration that the game just came out and is still in early access.\n\nGameplay:  The gameplay of Bunker Punks is one of the shining jewels within the entire game itself.  When you step back, you can see that Bunker Punks is a first person shooter, but the closer you get and the more you play, you realize that there is more than just going from room to room killing everything.  Weapons act differently depending on the type used.  The shotgun, for instance, peppers opponents with a hail of pellets, and does amazing in your face damage.  The farther away you go, not only does the damage lessen, but the number of pellets that meet their mark is also reduced.  The assault rifle is the opposite, doing the most damage when you step away from your target and fire from afar.  Different enemies are introduced slowly, each of them having a different method of attack and movement.  Most importantly, the game adds much needed replay value to any first person shooter by offering upgrades to your bunker, additional Punks available for purchase, and various articles of clothing that can be worn to gain different bonuses to armor or damage.  Some folks may find the game itself repetitive, and there's no doubt it is, but the mark of a good game is giving enough variation to the repetition to continuously make it fun.  Also lacking is any involved story, so if lengthy reading and involved character backgrounds are your cup of tea, you might find yourself wanting.  Overall, there's two things you don't mess with, Texas, and Bunker Punks.  Gameplay gets a 9/10.\n\nSound:  Bunker Punks sports a fun and sassy soundtrack that transfers from a slower ambient lull during board choice or upgrading, to the hard rock, blood pumping riffs that happen when it's time to fight.  The question is where you find it varied enough for all of the bullet slinging you'll be doing.  The sound effects are simple and yet appropriate, and the voice acting above all is incredibly clean and professional.  The various punks spit out one-liners and various other comments when gaining weapons and equipment, and it's extremely welcome to hear that they don't sound like an amature talking into a $3 microphone housed in a empty coffee can that's sitting in a 5 gallon bucket of water while leaving all of their windows open so that the sounds of the sweet industrial workers putting up low income housing can be heard in the background.  Sound gets a 8/10.\n\nLook:  The look of Bunker Punks is either something you love, or hate.  The pixelated goodness is a staunch reminder of 90's style shoot em ups, with all of the blocky, simplistic textures it entails.  You might not always know exactly what the hell you're shooting at, or if what you're about to pick up is a helmet or a catcher's mitt, and the rooms may have a great deal of reused images, but there's a lot that even individuals whom like a more modern look to their games can't deny.  The user interface is clean and minimalistic, giving us all of our needed information while leaving a very minor impact on the immersion into the game.  Everything moves very smoothly on screen, from the hovering transitions of the play screen, to the swapping of gear and weapons.  Overall you'll get very little in the way of complex shadows, lighting, effects, or textures, but what you do get is perfect for the style of the game and is quite professional. Look gets a 7/10.\n\nBunker Punks strives to be the best at simple, fun, and satisfying gaming that you can do even if you only have a few minutes to play, and it accomplishes it's mission extremely well.  I'll always be interested to see what new Punk or Upgrade there is to achieve, and the difficulty level of the game will keep most gamers occupied for enough time to easily get the early access asking price of $14.99 worth of fun.\n\nOverall, Bunker Punks gets an incredibly solid 8/10.","March 30","true","7.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Though technically it isn't totally from the start 'cose everytime you die you get to open more unlocks for future games.\n\nWho would want this game?\n- Someone with little time and who likes simple single player shooter games.

The shooting is simple and very well implemented and each enemy type is nuanced so having to employ differing tactics for each is a must.\n\nThe novel concept of upgrading your bunker works very well and drives you to seek out all the rooms in a bunker even when down to last few health points.\n\nIt also has a side effect of when you loose someone in your bunker it actually feels like a loss not just a snazzy health mechanic.\n\n","March 31","true","11.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The sounds are amazing and the game is fun. From the zine the devs have released, there’s a lot of background and lore to the world that Bunker Punks is set in. I’d love it if the game pulled more of that in, maybe having specifically-themed bunkers based around major corporations, having weekly runs that are hand-crafted bunkers, or even some activities or bunker runs out in the open air throughout various times of day.\n\nThere’s so much potential here for something much more creative than what currently exists, and I hope they meet that potential. Seeing this universe confined to being represented by hallways and kickass music would feel like a huge loss, especially when it’s clear there’s been so much effort actually put into crafting the world.\n\nCheck out my full video review for more info!\nhttps://youtu.be/QaWGAn1ZtgA","March 30","true","1.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Dak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/reverend_dak/","193 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI love this game (so far) the simplicity of controls is a huge plus. The game play reminds me of Doom or Quake (1 and 2). It's fast and hectic. It's a great First Person Shooter, which is my favorite type of game, that just drops you right into the action. The basic game play is you raid enemy bunkers, bring home stuff, re-fit, raid again.\n\nI love the theme. A post-apocalypic world, where you play an underground movement in a corporate controlled world. You go on raids to gather equipment, money and tech. The equipment is basically weapons and buffs. The buffs come in all kinds of forms, from armor to sneakers, hats to helmets. They're all just equipment that gives you buffs depending on the actual pieces. All the equipment is shared among your team of Punks.\n\nI was worried about the bunker building aspect, but in reality it's super simple, and really just a "skill" tree that all your Punks share. No levels, just buffs that you spend your Creds on. It's actually very old-school, where money represents experience points, and you spend those points to buff your characters. Simple, abstract, and very cool.\n\nI like that certain Punks have certain skills and weapons by default, and I love the Molly starts your game off with just a pistol. But as you play, and you figure out your style of play, you can just pick the Punks that suit your style. And buff/bunker-build appropriately.\n\nThe more you play, the more access to Punks, bunkers and equipment you'll get. So even if you totally die after a couple raids, you get to pick and choose more stuff for next time. It basically rewards you for playing, even if all your punks die. The next attempt you'll likely do better and better. It really adds to the replayability.","March 30","true","18.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Although with a classic style the graphics look crisp and detailed.\n\nThey have mixed the classic FPS genre with the popular modern roguelike genre and it works very well. The description mentions bunker building and the steam screenshot of the bunkers looks a lot like the Fallout Shelter mobile game. The bunkers add upgrades to your character for the FPS portion of the game rather than actual base building. Ie, More damage, health regen etc. After your game ends you have the ability to spend tech you collected on upgrades that carry over into the next playthrough including new characters, its a nice touch.\n\nThe game is Early access and my experience so far was with the initial build and its great to see the dev active on the steam forum with the first patch released within 2 days of EA launch.\n\nThe game already feels polished and is due to come out of early access spring 2017 based on info on steam.

The title pulls obvious inspiration from other successful indie roguelites and combines them into a cohesive and entertaining package.\n\nThe game looks like Doom and plays like Quake. During each run you purchase "bunker" upgrades a la Rogue Legacy, and after your run has ended you purchase upgrades that will help you in your subsequent runs a la Risk of Rain. The former upgrades are things like additional damage and health for your characters, while the latter upgrades unlock bunker upgrade options and new items that will drop during your next run.\n\nThe game is very enjoyable in its current early-access state. The only downside is a lack of variety in environments and enemies, but new content is promised during development.\n\nI would recommend this game to players who enjoy making steady progress over several runs. I suppose it is possible to complete the game on your first run through, but a lack of unlocked upgrades is going to make it very difficult.","March 30","true","3.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Graphicswhise it pays tribute to the early days of 3d gaming but it fits and positively sustains the simple gamplay mechanics. There is no zoom or ironsights just cirlestrafing and quick aiming against ever increasing numbers of enemies.\n\nEach level consists of a number off floors which the player has to clear in order to finish the level and get to safety. If you die, you have to start over again and lose all your progress. Throughout the levels you can collect different loot which is either weapons, types of armor, money (used for upgrading the stats of you character as long as s/he is alive) and tec-credits (which can be spent on permanent improvements for the upcoming games at the end of you characters life). Upgrading your stats is fun and adds a little resouce management character to the game.\n\nHowever there is still room for improvement. Music is a bit repetitive. I hope they add more tracks to the different levels, same goes for the graphic design. It would add more individuality to the various locations you visit. Another good idea would be to make the overworld map so that you can only advance towards the final goal without visiting all levels. This way you would need to make choices which loot you need the most and therefor decide where to go next.\n\nThe verdict: Solid straight forward shooter, if you love Quake, Doom an the like, definitely give it a try. If you grew up with more modern shooters (COD, Battlefield), you might still like it and get it on a sale.","March 31","true","3.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You work as a band of rebels tearing up corporation buildings to try to destroy the corporation forever. And, I'll tell you, this game is super fun.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to old school shooters like Doom. You have a character with a gun who shoots evil robots with guns. Simple, genius, the best. Your character moves lightning fast and is super responsive. The guns fire dead on point (with expected spread of course). These, combined with rooms filled with enemies, makes for a super fast paced game.\n\nThe rouge-like qualities are pretty decent. Your game will be divided into runs where you work your way thorugh a map of different buildings trying to get to the last one, and the shops between runs. In the runs you fight robots, upgrade your bunker (to give your dudes extra perks), and get killed (because you gonna die). The shop areas in between give you new punks, bunker rooms and upgrades to help you on your future runs. This gives the combo of great rouge-like combat with persistant progression.\n\nNow, it all sounds fine and dandy, right? What, you might ask, is lack luster about this game? The game doesn't feel like it has a ton in it. I've trounced through many levels and only found very basic weapons of every class. I feel like I've seen every piece of armor that you can loot out of buildings and I've fought every type of robot (and I'm only 3 hours in). This being said, I still want to play more. There is a decent number of enemies (around 7 or eight types), each of which has their own niche. The guns and armor does end up making my runs feel samey in terms of strategy, but there's always new situations to shoot your way out of.\n\nIn addition to this, there is the elephant in the room. The graphics. There are some graphics purests our there that can have nothing but ultra realitstic, 4k 1080Gigapixel graphics. And i say, thats legit, good graphics are pretty sick. If that's you, you won't like these graphics. They are pixel art, and pretty good pixel art at that. I never stopped and thought that anything actually looked bad. In fact, I quite enjoyed the aestethic.\n\nSo, all in all, Bunker Punks is an awsome game. It's tons of fun to play, even is it's lacking some depth at the moment. It's definitely worth picking up, or at least keeping on your radar.","April 2","true","6.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

For the rest, it's just not as good as most of the old FPS I can think of ...\nThe level design is a disaster : long, narrow hallways, with rooms full of ennemies at the end of it. You are right, you can't strafe to avoid their projectiles.\nMost of the ennemies are just waiting for you right behind the doors. So you'll lose life in half a second once you open it. The other ennemies are not really moving unless you move. So they look like they are dead (or just slighty depressed).\n\nThe shooting sensations are horrible (using a shotgun reminds me of an old paintball gun) and the fight are not interessting at all.\nOn top of that, all the levels are the same : they are badly textured, and basically are just a succession of rooms with nothing interesting in them.\nOnce you cleaned the 3 levels of each place of all the ennemies, you can go back to your base and upgrade some random points (more life, more ammo, better weapons). But once again, you do that to go back on the field, to kill ennemies that are not agressive in rooms that are all the same.\n\nSo after 20 mn of the game, you don't want to launch it again.\n\nGo play "8bit killers" or "Gun Godz" if you want oldschool action : they are both free and cool.","April 6","false","0.4"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Bunker Punks seems pretty simple at first. But the real charm comes from it's simple style, twitch shooter gameplay, the random drops and randomly generated dungeons and the thrill of making it to the elevator. The added perk of stringing together combos to heal yourself while you're in the field is the real golden egg behind the design. Forcing yourself to either stagger your opponents health to kill them all systematically, bathe your opposition in explosives to drop them evenly, or use a high stopping power single-shot weapon to push them all down one by one; is fun and rewarding, especially after a heavy melee of angry red bullets flying at your face.\n\nI'm really happy I jumped on Early Access for this title, it's extremely fun. Let's hope more will be on approach soon. But until then, enjoy the Bunker Punks! It's a wonderful experience.","April 7","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fun, fast paced, twitch shooting roguelike\n\nBunker Punks is a refreshing sight on early access. It's pretty fleshed out, it's fun, BUT this is a review for the early access (12/04/2016)d/m/y\n\nThe gameplay is a fast paced FPS, with heavy rogue-like elements. Bases are randomly generated on the map, with different types of floors, and each floor is randomly generated. If you enjoyed tower of guns or paranautical activity, you may have an idea of what you're in for. The game has beautiful pixel art, solid music (in my opinion. It's heavy industrial, really fitting of the mood but it's certainly a genre that won't be for everyone). There's base building, multiple characters, and a nice difficulty climb.\n\nThe bad, however, is the level art (the walls, etc), while fitting to the setting do blur together after a while. Different types of levels (medical, security, survey, etc) look slightly different from eachother (some more than others), but it's not a large enough difference. As is the game is unfinished, so i won't comment on length, but it has a good amount of replayability at the moment (certainly a lot more if you're not skilled at these genres going in)\n\nI highly recommend you play through until you die that first time. When i started playing I had a lot of questions, and I started to chalk it up to early access, but you'll start unlocking a lot of things and answering all those questions after your first run ends.\n\nOverall, 8/10 at the moment. If the updates keep coming and add more bosses, another world / challenge passed the first, and some new level art, i'd happily bump it up to 8.5. The developers have the 'seeds' for levels displayed, so I don't see why a speed run seed input like the binding of isaac has couldn't happen down the road. As someone who rates 5 as average, and finds most games at or below that, I hope you'll understand this is high praise and something to keep your eyes on.","April 12","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Please check it out. Note: I paid for the game myself & I am not affiliated with the developers. My opinions are my own. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5H_eGA_ViDw\n\nBunker Punks is a fantastic framework on which the devs plan to create an extremely fun rogue-like-like (rogue lite?). I bought Bunker Punks in probably the stupidest way. Impulsively. When purchasing games ESPECIALLY early access games one should always do thurogh research, and think before making a decision. Do I regret buying the game? No, but I regret how I bought it.\n\nNow more importantly how is Bunker Punks? It is an excellent framework. There are procedurally generated levels. Different types of enemies which scale and appear as you progress. The levels are random but there is an over arching world map (a la Mario 3) which gives you choice on your way to the end. There are 4 armor slots (head, chest, hands, & feet) and there are a variety of different sets which give varying different bonuses everything is mix and match as you choose. There are 5 different weapons(I assume they are weapons groups too but there aren't more weapons yet) they are: baseball bat(melee); pistol; shotgun; auto rifle; rocket launcher. Each weapon feels unique and requires different strategies for each. The weapons and armor that are in the game now work great and are fun; once a wider variety are added it's going to make the gameplay much more fun.\n\nThis being a rogue lite (like-like) there is a meta game. Upon starting you pick a character(or more if you've unlocked them) and immediately enter a lever (I believe it's your base that your clearing out). Once cleared you arrive at your base. Here you can spend Credits that you find on enemies and boxes on leveling up your base. You can buy medical labs, firing ranges, and other buildings(modules). These modules can individually be leveled up. For example: one of the modules is the rifle range. Each level of this module gives +25% to rifle damage. The upgrades are quite valuable. Upgrades combined with appropriate armor bonuses can be awesome giving you + 100% damage or more! There is another collectible besides Credits and it is Tech. Upon the death of all of your characters you're sent back to the beginning (character selection). This is where Tech comes into play. You can spend the tech you've acquired on more characters, items, armor, modules, etc.\n\nIf you're a fan of this genera Bunker Punks is a game to check out. Currently there is a very solid base game. If it was to never receive an update it wouldn't be worth the money. It would be too dull. However because the groundwork has already been laid the updates should come relatively easily. The devs don't need to build fundamentals but rather add all the fun stuff. Perhaps don't buy it quite yet. Unless you're prepared for the plausibility that this game is abandoned. Definitely add it to your wish list or follow it because soon enough this game is gonna be really freaking awesome!!!!\n","May 7","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
