"Comply" or "Now do the karate move". I stared at it. And it stared back. For what seemed like eons I watched it. It was seducing me. It was corrupting my morals and everything I hold dear.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/leadprophet/recommended/404410/","leadprophet","Eschaton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/leadprophet/","107 products in account","NOTE: This is a very old review. I have also been negatively involved with the developers and parted ways with the project since then, so I will not do a followup review as I think I would be unfairly biased. You should probably go look for more recent reviews than this one.\n\nEndless Sky is a straight up ripoff (with several excellent additions) of the Escape Velocity series - and that's a good, even great thing.\n\nCons:\n- Economy is static, not dynamic like in EV\n- I'm pretty sure the ships just fly around; they don't affect the economy either. For example, you can't ever clear a sector of pirates; new ones will always spawn to take the old one's places, sometimes right before your eyes\n- Enemy AI is incredibly stupid; I've had pirates with only missile launchers chase me down even after they expend all their missiles, which means I get a free kill\n- It is definitely possible, especially early in the game, to get auto-ganked by huge mobs of enemies as soon as you take off from a planet, before you even have a chance to see what awaits you in space. Since there's no skill, just dumb luck, this is quite frustrating for people like me who try to get through games like this without save-scumming as much as possible.\n-Besides the rebel plotline, it's really hard for me to find any of the other plotlines. I had one other plotline offer, but I was really hoping to ally with the Republic and I have seen no offers from them at all - which sucks since you need their military license if you want to buy their ships.\n-There are no pirate-customized ships on sale, even on the worlds that explicitly say they are for sale.\n\nPros:\n- Combat pacing is perfect\n- Progression feels good\n- Visuals are a step up from EV:Nova\n- Autopilot for landing, shooting, and multi-jumping is very good\n- The balance between speed, power, and heat means there's a lot of thought to put into customizing your ship\n- Customization of your ship is properly encouraged within limits; it's possible to have a "millenium falcon" type ship\n- Ship boarding actions are hugely improved from the EV series\n- Game is in a very stable and efficient state already\n- Mortgages and Crew mechanics are a great addition to make management of your liquid assets more complex\n- Fleet commands are of course a welcome improvement\n- There's plenty to explore and even late into the game I feel like there are more secrets that I will uncover with proper detective work\n- Game is open-source, free, and fully cross-platform. It doesn't get better from a licensing standpoint.\n\nThe Weird:\n- You never have to pay for fuel. At all. Yet much of the economy is apparently based around deuterium fuel processing. This makes zero sense, but I'm not yet sure whether it's a good or a bad thing for gameplay.\n- You seemingly can't buy any equipment to improve the quality of your long-range (on map) scans\n- Events happen, but I've yet to see any planets trade hands even when factions are at war. The game FEELS very static.\n- Every action takes exactly 1 day. You have no option to spend more days on a planet, just to use up time, and no matter how long the jump is, every hyperspace jump takes 1 day.\n\nThe Wanted:\n- A news feed\n- Distinction between privateers and pirates; faction-aligned privateers only prey on certain non-faction ships\n- Dynamic, persistent economy - ships should have real lives, taking jobs on worlds. If they die, they die. If no one takes a job, it stays there until someone does take it. If food gets dumped on a planet, then prices of food should plummet after the sale. Every planet should use/produce stockpiled resources at a certain hidden rate to determine how fast that depreciation recovers/occurs, and the planets should spawn new spacecraft at a given rate depending on their population.\n\nWonderful game with a long, long future ahead of it.","November 20, 2015","true","12.2"," 116 of 120 people (97%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","97","116","120","6","13"

If you do not know this series, much of the information here won't be as relevant, but should still give good insight as to what kind of game it is.\n\nFor the sake of comparison I will be using a Pro's and Con's list.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPro's:\n*Gameplay has been made significantly smoother compared to the EV games.\n\n*Travel is a breeze now;\n-Landing is done automatically.\n-Jumping through multiple systems only requires a single command.\n-You can initiate a jump from anywhere in the system.\n-Simplified controls.\n\n*The dialogue, port info and item descriptions are well written and fit in perfectly.\n\n*A treasure of content in terms of places to visit, ships to encounter and buy, outfits to use and secrets to uncover.\n\n*You can have a LOT of ships in your fleet.\n\n*You can outfit every ship in your fleet seperately.\n\n*Once in space, everything seems to be real-time. Meaning that a fleet jumping to another system can be found back if you follow them there, and your own ships can be several systems away while you are "jumping" ahead of the pack. (You can avoid this by holding the jump button.)\n\n*More advanced, better boarding mechanics with more options and actual finiancial risks, such as "death benefits" you need to pay when a crew member dies.\n\n*Simple but lovely graphics.\n\n*It's obvious, but still worth mentioning: It's absolutely FREE!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCon's:\n*Occasional typo.\n\n*Sound effects could be better. The dev has this high up on his priority list, however.\n\n*No music. Great opportunity to put up your own tunes though.\n\n*Currently only the "Free Worlds" main plot is available, meaning story-wise the game is quite limited. I believe the dev is still working on more main plot lines.\n\n*Lack of a Bar or something similar.\nEdit: The Space Port acts as the Bar, but without a news function, betting function or hiring function.\n-Instead of hiring escorts, you buy or capture ships. (I see this as an improvement as you can customize your own ships.)\n-Instead of news you occasionally get a text pop up when entering a port explaining some current events across the galaxy.\n\n*Doesn't seem like taking a loan will ever be worth the costs.\nEdit: It's worth the costs when using the money to buy more or bigger freighters, once you've found a good trade route.\nEdit 2: It can become quite tricky to balance out your loans' daily interest payment vs the gain in profit from increased cargo space. I stand corrected, this is not a con, it's a well balanced mechanic.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSo...?\nI highly recommend giving this a try, whether or not you've played any of the EV games. There's something here for fans of RPG, Adventure, Exploration, Trade and Sci-Fi setting. If any of that interests you, don't let this one slip away.\n\n=== Review is subject to change without bias as I explore further in this universe. ===","October 31, 2015","true","9.3"," 53 of 57 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","53","57","0","1"

The sense of achievement of buying a new ship is great.\n\nFourth, difficulty (this may be a con for some people), this game has no mercy, if the game wants you death, it will spawn either a pirate flotilla or just a well armed pirate ship in the system just to destroy you.....yes this game is difficult as you dont know what to expect when entering a new system or leaving a planet, there is always the possibility of being  ganked by pirates.

Even if reverse thrusters were 1/4 as strong as the main ones, it would be much appreciated, and I think realistic; however, I don't know how difficult it would be to impliment that.

I'll explain why.\n\nThe short is: It's well put together for the most part; combat is little awkward but mostly avoidable. It is free, but seems to lack an end-game goal.\n\nOh, and if you do start, get the Cargo ship first. Consider the others once you're out of debt. In the Trading screen, hold Shift, Ctrl, or Alt to buy/sell multiple items at once.\n\nThe long is:\n\nFirst the good stuff:\nPrice: I don't know their intent with the game, but it is free. I've not found any kind of microtransaction BS, so it is completely free. Hard to argue with that.\nFew bugs: I shouldn't have to count this as a good point, but with the market as it is...\nAutosave: VERY frequent. Should the game crash or you get killed, it will send you back maybe a minute or two of playtime.\nYou can build a fleet of ships, rather than just having to upgrade one giant ship. There is some control in the orders you give. I still recommend only having a fleet of very big ships, and sticking to one ship until then.\nIt isn't hard to build up money after the early game.\nEverything has a 100% sell value. So if you buy stuff by mistake, it just costs you a second to correct it. Goods change value by planet, but equipment and ships don't, so buy and sell those wherever.\n\n\nThe bad stuff:\nMouse control for direction and shooting is unavailable, but would have been nice (I'm thinking like SPAZ).\nYour fleet isn't good at staying near you if they are freighters. So don't buy small ships for your fleet, they are pirate bait. Big ships can at least survive long enough to resolve the situation (regroup and kill, run away, land on planet, etc).\nIt is very easy to miss the storyline (I did) when trying to make a quick buck early on.\nThe economy doesn't evolve. Values in each system stay exactly the same. While this does make things easier, it also removes any incentive to find new trade routes when you have a good one. This also means the jobs don't really evolve, so the stuff you see early on is all that will be there.\nEach solar system feels tiny. You warp in next to the planet, and... that's pretty much it. Everything happens within sight range of a planet, so each system feels tiny, and all systems feel identical when you're flying around.\nYou start in debt. I realize this is part of the point of the game, but it feels weird having that weight hanging over our head for so long when jobs pay very little.\nYou can't switch between piloting different ships in your fleet.\n\n\nThe game doesn't seem to have an end goal, so you kind of have to set them for yourself. "Ok, I'm in debt. Let's get out of debt", "Ok, I'm no longer in debt, let's get a ship that doesn't suck". "I've got a decent ship, let's get the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the Galaxy". After that, uh, I don't know, keep going? Get a fleet I guess?\n\nGetting money is also a grind. You start off in debt, which means your #1 goal is to make as much money as possible in as little time as possible, because if you don't you'll run out. Running goods from system to system is probably the easiest and most boring way to do this. Once you get out of debt, it's all profit though. I mainly stuck to cargo runs, which does appear to be the fastest way to get cash, once you have some decent capacity.\n\nThe pirates are just random enough to be annoying but not consistent enough to be a threat to plan for until very late in the game. With your first ship it really is just a crapshoot if there is enough friendly ships to kill the pirates before they get you. Even with mid-size ships it is far better to run away than try to fight. Big ships can stay and fight, but it is still usually easier to just run away. If you're making money cargo-hauling, don't even bother with weapons until you have a super freighter or a Behemoth, and even then I'd say wait until you have two of them, because you can still just run away.\n\nVerdict: Above average\n","November 7, 2015","true","14.8"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","22","24","2","0"

Basically your general buy low and sell high principle with missions and a couple other factors.  This makes the game very easy to pick up and enjoy within the first 10 minutes which is a luxury you don't have with most games.  It's not the prettiest game I've seen, but the low spec requirements make it playable on any system.\n\n\nPros: -Decent economy sim\n-Large variety of planets and solar systems; the map is huge\n-Some customizability for space ships (weapons, engines, etc.)\n-Can be addicting\n-Simple UI\n\nCons: -Not enough customizability with ships, both aesthetically and functionally\n-Tedious at times, sometimes it feels like nothing's really happening.  You have to grind to get the necessary money to purchase bigger and faster ships, whether that be by destroying other ships or being a merchant.\n-Annoying animation when you make the jump to another solar system.  Rewatching the animation, though it's only 5 seconds, can become irritating after a while. I realize that that's nitpicking a little, but it'd be nice to be able to skip that animation.\n\n\nAll in all, it's definitely worth it to check this game out.  It's a good game to kill some time, and best of all, it's free :) I haven't explored all the features of the game yet, which I suppose is a good thing! There's a ton of potential with this concept, and I'm interested to see what the developers can do to make this game even better.","December 24, 2015","true","7.9"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","2"

NAEV and Endless Sky.  NAEV has some people doing a great job (also a great game), but with much slower development.  Endless Sky is very polished, very content rich and has a lot of UI features none of this line of games ever had.\n\nEndless Sky is the kind of game I'd have made if I had the motivation and energy.  The fact that it's moddable is just fantastic and I hope it encourages a number of interesting mods in the future.\n\nI often spend small quantities of money trying out games on steam and didn't even realize until revisiting the store page that this game is FREE.  Holy cats.  I'll need to post a donation to the game devs.\n\nGood things:\n\n1) The turn based boarding mechanic is a wonderful way to add an interest to boarding operations without it consuming much time or interfering with the central feel of the game play of piloting a starship.\n\n2) Good ship progression.  I see some complaints of a slow/humble start.  I did experience that a bit.  The game does reward doing fun things like combat and piracy and tends to discourage focusing too much on trade or missions.  Once you get over the hump you start moving right along.\n\n3) Better shield regen is VERY nice for things like demanding tribute from planets.  In the old EV games, particularly Nova, it reached a point where your shield regen was basically how fast you could kill ships and you spent tons of time kiting and waiting.\n\n4) Kiting is less rewarding.  The ships turn and lose interest and often come at you at different speeds forcing more variety to how battle large fleets.  You're more likely to duck in and out of engagements with heavy ships and pull back to lick your wounds.  Also anti missile prevents waiting out long barrages of missiles.  A good improvement on EV style combat mechanic all around.\n\nSuggestions:\n\n1) Battleships are god tier.  I tried so hard to make a lighter more maneuverable cruiser work, but in the end just wrecked everything with a shield beetle.  Probably hard to tweek the balance at this point, but it'd be fun to be able to get by on being 'dodgy'.  I'll keep trying a bit.  Not ruling it out completely yet.\n\n2) The lock on mechanics aren't great.  It uses a selection of always choosing the closest ship rather than selecting from what you facing or cycling through promising opponents (if re-selecting within only a second or two try a different ship than selected).  So that annoying fighter behind you robs your lock from the ship you actually want to strike.\n\n3) You can lock a target and spin to face it automatically.  I'm less into that.  I'd like to be forced to maneuver and fire with my perhaps my turrets and guns veering towards the target to the degree that each is able.\n\n4) Command points (ala Sword of the Stars) would be AWESOME.  As your notoriety grows or perhaps through some other means gain the ability to command more vessels and otherwise have a sort of fleet limit so that you have to be choosey with your ships used for end game content.  Perhaps a maximum of 6?  I see a lot of posts of people accumulating masses of shield beetles with shield regenerators to keep them alive and then enough weapons quantity to contribute to your killing.  Might be cool to limit that a bit.  Maybe command points are vastly more generous/more efficient for smaller ships as well?  Maybe you can have only one Heavy Cruiser as a command ship and all the others must be lighter?  Might need a good end game medium vessel to compensate that had some survivability.","April 24","true","56.6"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","0"

There is a bit of plot, so if that's your thing, go for it. You don't have to, you could just trade or be a pirate or whatever. As long as you pay off your loan and don't get killed, the game doesn't care where you go from there.\n\nIt has quite a bit of detail built into it, with a fair few planetary descriptions and such to give lore freaks a bit of juicy goodness. There are a lot of ships that you can buy, although you'll have to save for a while before you can even think of buying another.\n\nIt's also open source, so members of the community can have a field day making whatever world they envision.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/proberie/recommended/404410/","proberie","proberie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/proberie/","67 products in account","In the mid-90's there was a game called Escape Velocity released by Ambrosia Software, where you flew around in spaceships in a 2d universe, completing economic or combat based missions. I recieved a copy free copy of this game on a MacWorld Magazine disk and was immmediately hooked. I spent endless hours of my youth exploring the the Escape Velocity univerise. It's an open world, where you follow quests and decide which faction you were going to join and others that you were going to become enemies with. You could join the Confederates, Rebels, Pirates, or just remain an independent trader.\n\nEndless Sky is clearly modelled after the Escape Velocity series (Escape Velocity, Escape Velocity Override, and Escape Velocity Nova) and anyone who was a fan of those games should be playing this.\n\nThat being said, for me personally, Endless Sky brought back a lot of nostalgia from my gaming days in the 90's. Growing up I had a Macintosh computer, which really limited my computer gaming choices. There were the early Bungie games (Pathways Into Darkness, Marathon, and Myth 2) as well as Blizzard's Warcraft and Starcraft games. Bungie, Bllizzard, and Ambrosia Software were my three go to gaming companies and they all sparked my passion for gaming.\n\nEnough nostalgia, let's talk about the game. You start off with a trading ship and have to complete several trading missions in order to pay off the morgage you got for your first space ship. As the game goes on, you begin to explore the galaxy, earn more credits, learn more about the main plot, and eventually build and upgrade your ship. There appears to be one main storyline to this game (as opposed to the EV series where you followed a certain faction's story line) but you can go about it at your own pace. Some side missions pop up which also add an element of intrigue. All the missions require you to either take people/cargo somewhere, to fight other ships, or analzye something. At both the beginning and end of the mission there are no cutscenes but instead you read and sometimes make decisions on what was said.\n\nThe combat is a bit difficult to get used to at first and you'll need to buy another ship and upgrade a bit before taking anyone on. The first few hours playing this, not unlike my high school days, I always got my ♥♥♥ kicked. If you keep grinding out the trade missions, you'll soon have a ship to be reckoned with and can go face to face with everyone who wronged you. Also you can hire a fleet of ships to help fight along side you although you'll have to pay them x amount of credits to retain their services.\n\nI've played this game for several hours and it has kept me entertained and curious on how the story line will unfold. It's not ground-breaking at all, sometimes I got lost trying to figure out where the story picked up at, and the game is outdated graphics-wise but I'm recommending it.\n\nI'm also looking forward to the user created mods. Escape Velocity had a similar editor where there were a lot of great user created mods released for free and kept the game new and exciting after you exhausted the original game.\n\nIf your curious, give it a shot. You got nothing to lose but time - it's free.","November 11, 2015","true","7.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Blasting down other spaceships? A blast. Flying around? Speed of sound? Definitely mindblowing. And all the other stuff I didn't even mention? Awesome.\n\nFor the record, I'm simply amazed by the way it's played: trading, exploration, combat, you name it. And the fact that the game's highly moddable, makes it stand out even more. I'm just mindblown, mindblasted, just so addicted, and there's all that. It's so addicting that I play until midnight, that it comes to be a bit of a problem.\n\nAnd there's a few problems to name after describing how good it generally is. Frankly, I'm hoping for more storylines. Because there's only one storyline: Join the Free Worlds, Oppose other factions, etc. And doing that takes mid-heavy grinding and effort. Getting cash is hard, and downright tedious. Your mortgage payment is heavy, and otherwise pressingly cash-burning. And those are some problems to name. Worst of all of them, is the fact that there's only ONE joinable faction. The one storyline only allows you to join the Southern World Pact/Free World Pact. And that's just it. Stay a merchant, or join the Free Worlds. And it's just so sad, you can't start off joining the Republic/Navy and reach out for becoming a patriot, protecting the galaxy. I've always been thinking they'd been the major faction you can only join... But it's not.\n\nOverall, this game erupts with fun. The game is free to play, and as soon as you start playing, you're just about to start a voyage, an adventure within the galaxy. So, what if there's a few problems? I still enjoy the game itself.\n\nNonetheless, it's definitely a BLAST.","November 6, 2015","true","208.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

But it is worth sticking with it in my opinion.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sciaphobia/recommended/404410/","sciaphobia","Sciaphobia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sciaphobia/","104 products in account","Knowing nothing about the game except that the screenshots reminded me of the "Escape Velocity" series, I decided to give it a try. I didn't then, and still don't know if the similarities between the two games are intentional or not, but they are absolutely there. I have only played the game for a couple of hours so far, but it still feels like it is nearly the same game.\n\nIf you've never played any of the Escape Velocity games, I would go so far as to say that you missed out big time on those. There is good news though! This free game is a way to (kind of) rectify this!\n\nNow, obviously I am biased because the game reminds me so much of another title that I enjoyed. However, there's a lot of reason to like the game because of that. You start off in a sandbox universe that you can pretty much do what you want in. Do you want to earn your keep by transporting passengers around? You can do that. Perhaps you want to trade goods and earn your money through piloting a freighter. Well, you can do that too. Do those sound too similar? Well, then perhaps you should go hunt pirates instead. Don't want to hunt pirates? Then maybe you should BE a pirate. You can do that too.\n\nI haven't gotten far enough into the game to really comment on the story, but if it occurs the same way it did in Escape Velocity, it will happen over the course of your gameplay, and will tailor itself to you based on what you are doing. That means of course, that seeing where the story can take you will require experimenting with different playstyles. Now obviously this is just a guess, but the rest of the game is similar enough that I would be surprised if the story elements didn't function the same way.\n\nI would say that, as a gamer, you are doing yourself a disservice by not trying this game. Especially considering it does not cost you anything but time to do so. A lot of people comment on the game being free, and you will see why everyone seems so surprised this does not cost anything once you load it up yourself.\n\nEdit: Typo correction.","October 31, 2015","true","38.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

I'll be making dated additions to this review because the game is still in development.\n\nEndless Sky is pretty amazing if you can find the main plotline.  After I found it, the mysteries and plot twists kept me coming back.\n\nThe game takes place in the far-future of humanity.  By the year 3013, humans have colonized a great deal of the galaxy.  You, as the player, have always wished to head into space and pilot your own spaceship.  Unfortunately, not long after your dream begins to come true, a horrible catastrophe makes galactic civil war almost certain.\n\nPROS:Autosaves between planet landings, you NEVER lose your ship permanently\nAutosaves before vitally important plot choices\nSnapshot-style save system: you are able to redo quest choices over-and-over by saving before making a choice\nQuick response time when controlling your ship\n(Nearly) unlimited potential ship configurations (weapons, engines, shields, etc.)\nAttractive planet graphics and planet surface photographs\nMany planets to visit, all with various kinds of political and social climates\nPlot twists and unsolved mysteries\nAnyone can make suggestions and potentially help to add content to the game: https://github.com/endless-sky\nEven if you don't want to add any official content, mods are always welcome\nHelpful community\nCONS:Not many detailed side quests in addition to the main storyline\nRepetitive gameplay\nIt's possible to miss the main storyline for a long time, if you don't explore the right areas of the galaxy\nOf the three faction-based main storylines proposed, only one of them is currently 100% complete\nEITHER: (aka. points that may be +/- depending on your likes/dislikes)Gameplay takes place entirely on a 2-D plane\nAll of the plot is text-dependent\nThis is a one-dev project, he has the final say-so on changes made to the game; but he also takes good suggestions seriously\nThis game is a work-in-progress\nOverall, this game is what you make of it.  You can play the role of pirate, bounty hunter, renegade defender/pirate ship looter, rebel, or just a simple merchant/transport captain.  If you're stuck, there's a kind community around this game that's willing to help.\n\nI'm looking forward to what the future holds, because Endless Sky (so long as it's being developed) can only get better!","May 7","true","118.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I felt great satisfaction when the lights come on how some part of the game works.\n\nThen there's the "futzing".  Futz futz futz.  I can stare at a ship build and go back and forth and back and forth "1 of these or 2 of those or 3 of the other?" trying to tune the ship to work *just right*!  Its comparable to Star Ruler's ship building screen, only here you have to fly the thing and it feels that much closer to the metal.\n\nYou start play with a bank loan which will sap all the money you make.  There are ways to "hide" the money and miss loan payments but then your loan size increases due to interest.  Anyways you come right out of the chute with your hair on fire, so to speak, and it is really satisfying to get the loan paid off.  It felt "grindy" during that phase of the game, because you know the starter ship is crap - but the mechanism is believable and compelling  (i.e. rewards aren't too high for doing tasks).\n\nLater in the game other elements come into play that provide really good tension, like capturing ships.

Also the concept of compounding interest may come into play, depending on whether this strategy is used...\n\nLastly - the game is remarkably polished.

In the middle of a couple of jobs, I landed on a planet in what seemed to be a quiet system with no ships in sight. I checked the job board on this planet hoping to find a small job to complete on the way, but considering my almost full cargo, I wasn't surprised. I then departed from the planet to find myself in the middle of a massive firefight with ships almost 10 times the length of mine. I quickly intitalised the jumpdrive autopilot, praying that I would be able to escape. There was nothing I could do as one of the pirate ships noticed me and fired a couple of missles at me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OfficerHotPants/recommended/404410/","OfficerHotPants","✦ Officer Hot-Pants ✦","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OfficerHotPants/","74 products in account","This game is far more fun than you'd expect someone's free-to-pay pet project to be.  Much of what story currently exists is admittedly sparse and largely only in place as a means of pointing you in the direction of your next target but it has some interesting lore and side missions already and the potential for much more.  What's more, the game gets updated relatively frequently.  New ships & new equipment, bug fixes, new features, new worlds, new races to meet -- basically whatever the developer can come up with and find a way to integrate.  Add to that the incredible ease of modding (all you need is wordpad) and the game offers considerable time sink potential.\n\nIf you ever played the X Universe games then you've got some idea of what you can expect here.  Basically those but scaled down, easier to run and played from a 2D, top-down perspective.  How you persue your career amongst the stars is pretty much entirely up to you.  Maybe you want to establish a flotilla of trade ships and rake in the credits.  Perhaps you'd like to someday command a fleet of fighters from the bridge of your own cruiser (or even carrier, if you play your cards right and your luck holds out) and make earn a living hunting bounties & bringing law to the lawless pirate sectors.  Or, for that matter, maybe you'd like to assemble that fleet and pillage the core worlds.  You can make a decent living off of piracy once you upgrade from one-man fighter craft and, with a sufficiently fearsome reputation, you can even demand regular tribute from the worlds upon which you prey.  Or maybe you'd just like to pilot your own lone, cozy little shuttle craft -- maybe upgrade to a fancier cruise liner down the road -- and just ferry people & small shipments of goods from world to world and enjoy a simpler experience.\n\nAll in all, it's hard to decry a free product for not meeting a minimum standard and yet the developer decided to hold himself to one anyway.  Given the short download time, you won't even be out an afternoon if it fails to grab you.  If it sounds at all like something you could enjoy even just putting an hour or two into here and there then there's really no reason not to grab a copy for yourself.","April 4","true","38.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The ships range from tiny to massive, and their handling changes as well. Great selection of stuff to customize with that forces you to balance heat, power generation, and ship handling with the amount of weapons or cargo you want to carry.\n\nInteresting world: this game has a LOT of lore to dig into if you want to find it, or you can just take it as it is. up to you.\n\nEasily moddable: I haven't installed any yet, but mods take the form of plugins that you just place in the appropriate folder, and its designed for you to be able to change things easily.\n\nOpen source: You can help make this game.\n\nLow system requirements: anyone with a PC can play this pretty much\n\nCons:\n\nOnly one minor downside\nStill in development: while there are benefits to a living game, one of the downsides is content with some loose ends to be filled in later.

A nice mix of combat, exploration, and non-combat jobs. So, when starting a new game, you get a choice between a Shuttle, a Star Barge, and a Sparrow. CHOOSE THE STAR BARGE. While all three are pretty sucky and wimpy, the Star Barge is your best bet for earning the money for something better. Don't be tempted to get a Sparrow. It looks awesome, and it's designed for combat... or is it? It will easily be destroyed, and has little cargo/passenger space. So get a Star Barge, pick up the highest paying jobs available, and run like hell if a fight breaks out. You will, eventually, get the funds for better ships. So just hang in there. When you get the chance, I suggest buying a Behemoth class heavy freighter, and outfitting it for combat.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JBrave/recommended/404410/","JBrave","JProX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JBrave/","34 products in account","Honestly, this game is so good, I feel like I stole it. It had been a refreshing break from other indie developers; all trying new formulas and gimmicks to make games seem "fresh". It's honestly refreshing that a developer was able to create a game, and polish what elements it had; instead of adding gimmicky addons to the game. This game doesen't lie about what it is, and does a great job at what it tries to provey.\n\nI'm not going to give you clear and cocise pros, and cons. Instead, I'll say that all this game needs is to be polished. Gladly, I haven't seen any major bugs; besides the lack of some content (ships that say they are obtainable, but require an item not presently in the game to obtain). But that's a part of the developing process. All I can hope for is that the developers go big on this game, and try to master the elements of this game further. Every loose end must be tied up before attaching any new strings.\n\nI'd reccomend it, as I inhaled a whole 11 hours of it within a day; and I'm not even all the way through to what I consider the end of the game.\n\nA message to the devs: as a consumer; you did a hell of a job. Some ideas once you tie up loose ends if you are thinking of continuing the project are:\nDynamic Events\nQuestlines\nSpawn rates of enemies in some zones are a little crazy. It's hard to live life stealing pirate ships if you have to fight 1v6 against ships greater than you. I mean; 1V3 is okay because it adds challenge.\n\nThanks for reading my review~\n","November 10, 2015","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But moving on to the review and overall experience. But before getting to that, check out the Endless Sky site, it has good info you'll want to know when playing!\n\neasy review:\nPro:\n+A large universe\n+Plenty of ships to choose from\n+Plenty of shenanagins to get into (mostly fighting, escorting, and trading)\n+Definitley effort in describing each planet and lore (there are even holidays and events that happen on certain dates!\n+Moddable (right down to credits in a text file if you dont want to spend hours trying to get out of debt, but thats part of the fun! .... unless your a cargo/people carrier?)\n+Can be a sandbox if you want. (Not forced to do story missions)\n\nCon:\n- Sound effects could really use work (beam lasers and thrusters especially)\n- Lack of music (but that is what the steam music player is for?)\n- Uncommon graphical glitches (for my AMD graphics card at least). Extremely minor, just a flicker of a color (green or blue) for an instant, probably happens about once an hour?\n- Start off in massive debt (opening story), interest is very unforgiving. (not necessarily a con, but it makes it a rocky start).\n- Combat and flying takes getting used to (it feels awkward to me, as opposed to most other space games, I honestly thought it would feel closer to something like Starfighter: Disputed Galaxy)\n- Capturing ships is stupidly costly (Losing a single crewman and you are already paying 1/3 of the ship's worth, by the way, death benefits is calculated using the SHIPS WORTH, which is really really stupid and frusterating.)\n\nSory of my experience:\nYou start off taking a loan, a HUGE loan to buy a ship, you get to choose from a passenger ship, a cargo ship, and a combat ship. I personally chose the Sparrow. Named it the "Capt. Jack Sparrow" (the ship type was literally Sparrow) set off on an adventure and doing what seemed like tutorial missions with that guy heading off to retire! (good pay)\n\nQuickly realize I am getting milked dry from the ship mortage interest rate of 0.4% a DAY. Each system warp is a day, every time you land on a planet is a day, You have to make a good bit of profit to get out of debt! Choosing missions that are close and pay enough you get more money than you lose to make the trip (funnily enough escort missions are best for that to me!) Best part about escort missions? Who needs to fight? You can just spin up that hyperdrive with "J" and run like hell! Just watch all the bystanders and the navy mobilize to outright OBLITERATE any pirate who happens to give you a hard time! Ever seen a pirate dumb as bricks chase after you to the Sol system? I'd say you will, but he would be too busy dying within seconds! You wouldn't even get a chance to see his ashes! Tons of laughs for sure.\n\n*much questing happens*\nFinally made it out of debt! .... now what? Left directionless I just kept doing escort missions, saved up for a new better interceptor class ship! Bought myself a Beserker, instantly fell in love with it as opposed to my Sparrow!. I dubbed my new ship the S.S. Biscuit.\n\n*Some Escort missions later* Finally done enough to get better scort missions! Now instead of getting 15,000 or 20,000 credits per escort, I now get 60,000! however the ships turn like whales and are average sized freighters.\n\n*To be Continued* The story goes on ...\n\nP.S. They have a "cheat plugin" with tons of credits and all tech (Ships?) in human space. Enjoy.(for you sandbox lovers)","February 29","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Love the flavor text for all of the planets, the ship customization is pretty robust, and I love the fact that you can basically play the game as you wish.  If you want to run trade routes, shuttle passengers or fight pirates, or do a combination of all three, it's up to you.  And the fact that you can completely ignore the story if you'd like is an added bonus.  Sometimes I just feel like amassing as much cash as I can manage without worrying about politics.\n\nI can't wait to see what plugins come down the pipe.

C'mon, it's free!\n\nA free game is always worth a look, and almost always worth a few minutes of play. At time of writing, Endless Sky has held my attention for eight hours.\n\nYou start out by taking out a high-interest loan from the bank and buy one of three ships - shuttle, transport, interceptor - and you can guess what each is for. I went for the transport because I was channeling Firefly and felt like pretending to be Malcom Reynolds. Once you start, it's time to get to work - that debt isn't going to pay itself!\n\nAfter the first hour, the gameplay is what it is. Pick up cargo from Planet A and take it to Planet B - sometimes as a mission, sometimes hoping to buy low and sell high, sometimes on a timer. You can even mix it up and carry people or escort ships. Alternatively, you can go hunting for pirates, or be one yourself and raid other ships.\n\nThe controls are what you might expect from a 2D space simulator - sluggish. If you've ever played S.P.A.Z. the controls will be familiar (and equally frustrating in a firefight).\n\nThe story will automatically unfold at specfic moments when you land your ship, and if you visit the spaceport at each planet you can potentially pick up story missions for one of the various factions in the galaxy or chance upon a unique mission (though it is almost always a variation of what I mentioned earlier). You can pick up jobs from the job board or, as mentioned above, figure out the price of goods at your destination and buy them cheaper at your location for resale.\n\nPut on some suitable music (there's none in game) and use your imagination as to why you care to build a fleet of ships.

Feels very well fleshed out for a free game.  At the moment the game feels more concentrated on completing missions than on establishing trade routes (mission cargo is DRAMATICALLY more profitable per ton than regular trade goods).  However, it is entirely viable to play as a cruise ship and carry exclusively tourists, or to play as a cargo vessel trying to make deliveries on time.  Be you a privateer or tradesman, Endless Sky absolutely delivers.\n\nTo new players:\n1.  Read the player manual.  The tutorial is loose and allows you to be the Captain you want to be, but as far introducing    game mechanics, is a little sparse.\n2.  Avoid combat early if you aren't a pirate. Combat is unforgiving.\n3.  Use the save snapshot feature.  It is possible to accidentally ruin a game due to autosave in a bad situation.\n\nAreas that could be improved:\n1.  Aesthetically, this game is unpolished.\n2.  Autosave could be a multiple slot rotation, to avoid the dreaded die-load-die loop.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed titles like Sid Meier's Pirates, or to anyone who likes free stuff!","November 2, 2015","true","51.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The amount of time, thought, and work the dev must have put into this is just fantastic. Though I'm sure it started as a hobby project, it's clearly grown into something more. I never write reviews, but this is a game that truly deserves it.\n\nIt's a much more realistic trading/space sim than most others, and this is a good thing, as it gets rid of several annoying problems that often plague such games. For one, exploration isn't a blind dive into potentially troublesome situations since local maps can be cheaply bought to reveal the surrounding area. In addition, you can track prices on other planets without manually visiting them, thereby allowing you to plot trade routes quite easily. The story and lore is done through text. You can read as much or as little as you'd like, but the dialogue is natural and very well-done. The tutorial mission is fantastic, optional, and teaches you the basic controls. The synopsis for each planet gives each character and really does make each feel unique. Banter between ships is rather repetitive, but you're going to get that no matter how many unique lines are written.\n\nThe game aims to be flexible, and it does that extremely well. The risk/reward of piracy vs. trading is quite balanced. Losing a ship to pirates early during a risky job can feel devastating (as it should), but it's usually only a temporary setback. Conversely, taking a risk and trying to capture that ship that outguns you can be both a disaster or an enormous bolster to your ranks. The number of times I've said, "Oh man, almost!" have been too numerous to count, but most importantly, they've been accompanied by a feeling of excitement rather than frustration.\n\nThe dev has crafted the game in a way that pretty much anyone can add content or create plug-ins. I'm sure the content of the game will expand by leaps and bounds in the coming weeks. There are occasional bugs, but you can merely check the dev's github to realize he's still working on them. The fact that this is open-source will mean that these are crushed more quickly than usual as other users can fix them as well. Over 600 commits to git since March 2015 show how frequently the game is tweaked, bugs fixed, and content added. Perhaps the biggest drawback to the game currently is that the sounds are rather basic and there's no music. However, I'd expect both of those issues to be addressed soon enough. I can only hope the dev continues to develop more games, as this is the sort of endeavor that shows the true brilliance that indie games can yield.\n\nLastly, to address most of the negative reviews: if you can't figure out how to play this game, you are legitimately brain-dead, likely incapable of tying your own shoes. Sure, the game doesn't hold your hand, but the commands are pretty basic and the intro tutorial teaches you everything you need to know. "pirates op they kill so fast" - Well, no ♥♥♥♥, flying into a known pirate haven with a starter ship probably isn't going to go well. Use your brain. So yes, if you're a potato with insufficient energy to power a lightbulb, you probably won't like this game.

If you want to run trade routes, shuttle passengers or fight pirates, or do a combination of all three, it's up to you.  And the fact that you can completely ignore the story if you'd like is an added bonus.  Sometimes I just feel like amassing as much cash as I can manage without worrying about politics.\n\nI can't wait to see what plugins come down the pipe.

C'mon, it's free!\n\nA free game is always worth a look, and almost always worth a few minutes of play. At time of writing, Endless Sky has held my attention for eight hours.\n\nYou start out by taking out a high-interest loan from the bank and buy one of three ships - shuttle, transport, interceptor - and you can guess what each is for. I went for the transport because I was channeling Firefly and felt like pretending to be Malcom Reynolds. Once you start, it's time to get to work - that debt isn't going to pay itself!\n\nAfter the first hour, the gameplay is what it is. Pick up cargo from Planet A and take it to Planet B - sometimes as a mission, sometimes hoping to buy low and sell high, sometimes on a timer. You can even mix it up and carry people or escort ships. Alternatively, you can go hunting for pirates, or be one yourself and raid other ships.\n\nThe controls are what you might expect from a 2D space simulator - sluggish. If you've ever played S.P.A.Z. the controls will be familiar (and equally frustrating in a firefight).\n\nThe story will automatically unfold at specfic moments when you land your ship, and if you visit the spaceport at each planet you can potentially pick up story missions for one of the various factions in the galaxy or chance upon a unique mission (though it is almost always a variation of what I mentioned earlier). You can pick up jobs from the job board or, as mentioned above, figure out the price of goods at your destination and buy them cheaper at your location for resale.\n\nPut on some suitable music (there's none in game) and use your imagination as to why you care to build a fleet of ships. After all, it's free!","November 1, 2015","true","41.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everything starts out simple but things take a turn for the woese and then it's just a huge s***storm that's pretty enjoyable.\n\nWith that said, when you first make a new character, avoid starting the storyline since you'll die. You should amass a large reserve of cash by boarding and selling ships (it's fairly simple and there is a guide to it).\n\nALSO: with 16 GB ram, an i7-4790k, and a GTX 970 I had no trouble with fleet sizes below ~200. Once over 200, I had hige frame rat drops and the ingame CPU/GPU monitor typically spiked from 3%/2% to 200-600%/10-20% in very large fleet sizes. Though, I usually had task manager running through this and my ram never went above 4 GB and only 4 of my cores on my CPU were ever being used (not sure if the game uses more than one core but I saw activity on those graphs - could be from something else).\n\n","January 4","true","28.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can try it and decide if you like it, without losing anything.\nYou start off with a loan and the choice of three different ships, after that you are free to do whatever you want. The game offers you a string of tutorial missons which show you the ropes of the basic playstyle of your ship, while gives you some small pointers as well.\nYou can have an entire fleet of ships which can escort you and you can issue them simple commands.\nYou can add stuff. While the game is in it's infancy I can imagine there will be a boatload of user generated content to it. And the whole thing should be easy to do as well.\n\nThe bad:\nUsing passenger or trading ships can become boring at first, as you only jump and land, and hope that pirates don't kill you. At least until you get enough money for a lot of ships (and crew) to guard you.\nThe controls are a bit hard to figure out without checking the preferences menu, and the game only shows them for a short time on the bottom-left corner of the screen. The ships have inertia, so combat needs a lot of getting used to.\nThe background during flight is rather bland (what else would you expect apart from stars), and the closeness of planets, while useful, make the entire area feel just bland and empty. The game also devoid of music, only having a few sounds for thrusters and stuff, making the game feel slower, so it can quickly become boring for those used to faster-paced games.\nThe game itself is not really hard if you know what you are doing, but there can be instances of getting swarmed with pirates after take-off and thus dying quite fast, especially when you have only a single ship.\nThe graphics are dull. Planets only show a single picture above their menu, while ships look like low poly 3d models. This however can be easily remedied with editing, so not that big of a problem.\n\nThe game actually have a story and while it doesn't immediately point you to it, it can be interesting. All in all while the game can feel like an empty sandbox with spaceships, made by amateurs, it is solid enough to be enjoyable. And also it's free, with the option to add stuff to it.\n\nTL:DR\nIts free, it's small, try it out.","October 30, 2015","true","2.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

(Who, me?)\n-- It's free! No subscription required, needed, or existing. If you desperately want to pay money (o_O), too bad. There's no way to donate. :(\n-- You can play it offline. Unless you're using the Wi-Fi at your local overpriced coffee shop to play EVE, I don't see why this would matter too much, but hey.\n-- No real people, nice or otherwise. No scammers/trade hub spammers or price manipulators, but no amazing clan homies or complete strangers who give you 75 million out of the goodness of their hearts, either. You'll have to decide whether that's good or bad.\n-- Gankers are still around, though. Their being NPCs doesn't change anything. Remorseless pirates with serious superiority complexes? Same as ever. If you're playing with self-imposed hard restart... I pity you. Greatly. If you weren't completely insane before you started, you probably are now.\n-- No inflated prices, although some ships are pretty expensive.\n-- Banks are legitimate and actually trust you enough to give you a loan. Unfortunately, it's impossible to get one big enough to make skipping out and ruining your credit score worth it.\n-- There's a story, although I'm stuck at a certain point because my fleet isn't strong enough.\n-- Easier ship customization and cooler builds. (Crazy fast? Can do. Extremely hard to kill? You got it. No refueling needed? Quite right. Unscannable cargo hold? Indeed, my good man.)\n-- A much more casual, less intensive grind. (Endless Sky + trade route + music + relaxation = Endless Sky zen!)\n-- A surprising amount of stuff to explore and discover. While you may say, "But I can look at all the ships and outfit items from the Job Board!", those are only buyable ships and items from shipyards in systems that you've visited. So unless you've explored every nook and cranny of this huge galaxy (even the apparently inaccessible bits), that's not ALL the things. Nowhere close! There are alien ships available... they're just "not available in stores".\n-- It's open source. https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky Something you don't like or want to change? Make a plugin. Something you want to add? Go right ahead. Please. This game needs more! That is, unless you're scared of Git. No need to deny it. I don't blame you.\n-- Spreadsheets optional.\n\nTL;DR: If you like EVE Online but hate any of the following:\ndamage outputs\nweapon slots\npower and CPU balancing\ndecimal numbers\nfeeling like one of the poor and destitute 1%\nspending real money\nsinking all your free time into a game that, deep down inside, you hate\npeople\n\nthen try this game!\n\n-------------------------\nAdditional Notes:\n-------------------------\n\n[ship has tons of cargo capacity]\n[minutes of "clicklcickcliclcclicklicclkcliclkcliclkccliclkccliclkccliclkc..." at each end of trade route while buying trade goods]\n[eventually reads manual]\n"To buy more than one ton of a given trade good at a time, you can hold down the shift key (5x), the control key (20x), or both (100x). For players with enormous cargo fleets, the alt / option key (500x) can be used in combination with those other keys to sell up to 50,000 tons of cargo per click."\n[feels dumb for not reading manual]\nSeriously, read the manual. Even if you don't learn anything new, at least you'll know you're not doing anything terribly dumb, right? https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/PlayersManual\n\nOh, and don't root through the game files unless you're stuck or looking for spoilers. Even the filenames are spoileriffic.\n\nLooking for a good trade route? Try Food from Alioth to Denebola, and Medical from Denebola to Alioth.\n\nEven after you've found every alien ship, there's most likely still a ship left. It's supahsecret. You might have seen it flying around. Big, gray, and FAST.

Can't beat the price.\n2. Captures the feel of the old Escape Velocity series extremely well, with some much needed ease-of-use updates (such as being able to tell from the map what a system will pay for a given commodity, something you had to do by memory or with a notepad back in the day).\n\nCons:\n1. Piracy is not a viable option from what I can tell.  Even if you are able to disable a ship without destroying it (not easy in my experience), you only have maybe 3 seconds before some do-gooder tries to help you by blasting your prize into space dust.  If you do successfully manage to board a ship and attempt to capture it, you will very likely lose crew members in the process and end up paying death benefits.  Death benefits are, from my understanding, calculated as a percentage of the captured ship's value so you'll always make some profit if you sell the ship, but it can be too small to make it worth it.\n2. Combat itself needs a little work.  Large combats involving a lot of ships get chaotic and if your target is offscreen it can be next to impossible to track them on the minimap.\n3. There is a fair amount of grinding in the early game in the form of "deliver 12 tons of rubber goods to the Vega system" type missions.  That's true to the original series, but it's also not very exciting.  The good news is that if you're smart about it, that part won't last long.  I've seen a lot of people complain that you start the game with a mortgage on your ship, but if you trade intelligently and pick good missions (hint: plan your route efficiently!) you should be able to pay the mortgage off within an hour or so of play.  Once that's done, you should be able to work your way up to afford a decent ship not long after, and that's when things become fun.\n\nIn spite of those problems, it can be very addictive and will definitely scratch the nostalgia itch for those of us who remember EV fondly from back in the day.","November 1, 2015","true","32.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Endless Sky is a great game, overall.\n\nI do have a big complaint, however.  The very poorly done combat system.  I can progress no further in the game because of the endless traffic into each and every star system in the game.  The story mission I'm on needs me to fight 1 ship and steal a part.  Fine.  Dandy.  Problem is even when there is a ship alone (since we're talking random gen, here), before I can possibly disable it and loot, another ship or 2 jumps in.  Then another.  Then more still.  Say some of those ships are friendly?  Doesnt matter.  They blast disabled ships 99% of the time.\n\n0Again, I'm loving this game.  As long as I avoid combat and just focus on resources and being a space trucker, very well done.  This one issue is game breaking from a storyline perspective.  You want to do the missions?  Good luck, brother!","November 9, 2015","true","72.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KansaiBene/recommended/404410/","KansaiBene","Tycho Brohe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KansaiBene/","76 products in account","While this free, open source game has a lot to be developed, it also has a lot of promise.  It's not a pure pile of a free game like many free games are.  It definitely isn't a F2P title relying on microtransactions.  The developer just realized he couldn't devote his life to making this game, and figured crowdsourcing it would be ideal.\nI am not far in yet, so perhaps I will be expelling massive frustration once I get to the point of trying to conquer the galaxy, but here's a rundown of what I see so far.\n\nYou start the game buying a ship thanks to a hefty loan hanging over your head, which you will spend the early part of the game paying off.  You have three options for a starter ship:\n1) A shuttle only good for transporting people around from planet to planet, along with some minor commodity trading.\n2) A cargo ship which is focused on hauling goods, and a few passengers.\n3) A fighter so you can jump right into combat.  It's transport and trading capabilities are limited, so you'll have to really engage if you want pay off that debt.\n\nIt seems like these ships correspond to difficulty settings, easy, normal, or hard.  However, I didn't find much difference in difficulty between the cargo ship and the shuttle aside from the fact that the starter shuttle can jump between one more system than the cargo ship without needing to refuel. Payouts for transporting people seems to be a bit slim compared to payouts for massive hauling.  There is something in the game about illegal goods, but I have yet to discover them, or maybe I did and just haven't been discovered hauling them, yet.\n\nPresuming you don't pick the fighter, the early game is about learning which systems need which goods and trading back and forth to rack up money so you can pay off that debt, and to acquire more ships.  One of the nice things is that you can acquire a second ship in your fleet rather early, with the debt still hanging over your head if you like, or just upgrade your ship to the next tier.  You'll need to hire extra crew to pilot extra ships, but that's far cheaper than the debt you are paying off.  Truth be told, the early game is really boring for a while.  It's just pick up a job/quest, buy some cargo, jump to the target system, sell cargo, repeat, with a lot of freedom in how you choose to make your money.  If you happen to run into some pirates, they'll likely destroy you, and you just reload and try again.\n\nThere is a story to follow, with only one campaign completed at this time, but progressing through the story is a bit random.  It requires you to land on certain planets in some sort of order, but I am not sure which planets or what order that is.  But hey, the game is open source.  If you want to see more depth, you are welcome to contribute to completing those other campaigns.\nAnother thing to do early on is explore all of the systems, so you can map out the galaxy and plan your routes easier, however many planets will sell you a local area map which eliminates some of that exploring for a fairly low price.\n\nThough it bears no resemblance at all to FTL (no entering the ship and micromanaging crew details), I feel it would make for a decent roguelite and I have been playing it as such, deleting my profile every time I die.  Ironically, that is more enjoyable for me, in spite of the fact that the early game is so repetitive.  Not sure why.\n\nAll in all, if you don't mind unfinished projects, and like the idea of being an intergalactic merchant, there's very little reason to not give it a try.","December 30, 2015","true","21.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I chose to start as a trader, and it's really easy for me to take on 20 missions at once and keep getting missions as I fly around completing them.\n-The descriptions and the detail put into it is great.\n-The idea of it being open-sourced and available to modify is great. I haven't tried it yet though.\n\nCons:\n-A bit of a confusing interface, and limited controls. When one of my fleet ships was disabled, I couldn't figure out how to repair it for a couple of minutes. I ha to beat off around 7-8 pirate attacks while I was trying to figure it out. A lot of those more hidden mechanics could be more obvious.\n-It's very confusing on what is mounted onto your ship, what isn't, and how each module affects the ship stats. I largely have only bought ships and put an extra cargo area on them. I'd reccomend putting a seperate window on the right side that shows the ship slots, and as you change modules, it also displays the changes in stats.\n-The game seems (so far) pretty limited to small fights and trading. It would be neat to have more space in between planets, allowing for ambush attacks and whatnot instead of jumping into a sector and immediately knowing whether there are enemies there or not. Things happen incredibly fast, and most of the time I die before I even knew I was taking significant damage.\n-After the short tutorial storyline, apart from a couple of things happening in the galaxy, I haven't been able to find the main stroryline again. Some subtle hints as to where it is would be nice.\n-Please, give me more control over my fleet's ships. I have had so many times where we're extremely far away from a battle, yet one of my ships insists on firing it's missiles and wasting credits.\n\nConclusion: I hope that this is not the end of development for this game. It feels complete, yet still missing a lot of potential. If this was paid, I wouldn't reccomend people get it unless it's extremely cheap, but as it's free to play, I would say that there's no harm in trying it out.","October 31, 2015","true","22.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KansaiBene/recommended/404410/","KansaiBene","Tycho Brohe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KansaiBene/","76 products in account","While this free, open source game has a lot to be developed, it also has a lot of promise.  It's not a pure pile of a free game like many free games are.  It definitely isn't a F2P title relying on microtransactions.  The developer just realized he couldn't devote his life to making this game, and figured crowdsourcing it would be ideal.\nI am not far in yet, so perhaps I will be expelling massive frustration once I get to the point of trying to conquer the galaxy, but here's a rundown of what I see so far.\n\nYou start the game buying a ship thanks to a hefty loan hanging over your head, which you will spend the early part of the game paying off.  You have three options for a starter ship:\n1) A shuttle only good for transporting people around from planet to planet, along with some minor commodity trading.\n2) A cargo ship which is focused on hauling goods, and a few passengers.\n3) A fighter so you can jump right into combat.  It's transport and trading capabilities are limited, so you'll have to really engage if you want pay off that debt.\n\nIt seems like these ships correspond to difficulty settings, easy, normal, or hard.  However, I didn't find much difference in difficulty between the cargo ship and the shuttle aside from the fact that the starter shuttle can jump between one more system than the cargo ship without needing to refuel. Payouts for transporting people seems to be a bit slim compared to payouts for massive hauling.  There is something in the game about illegal goods, but I have yet to discover them, or maybe I did and just haven't been discovered hauling them, yet.\n\nPresuming you don't pick the fighter, the early game is about learning which systems need which goods and trading back and forth to rack up money so you can pay off that debt, and to acquire more ships.  One of the nice things is that you can acquire a second ship in your fleet rather early, with the debt still hanging over your head if you like, or just upgrade your ship to the next tier.  You'll need to hire extra crew to pilot extra ships, but that's far cheaper than the debt you are paying off.  Truth be told, the early game is really boring for a while.  It's just pick up a job/quest, buy some cargo, jump to the target system, sell cargo, repeat, with a lot of freedom in how you choose to make your money.  If you happen to run into some pirates, they'll likely destroy you, and you just reload and try again.\n\nThere is a story to follow, with only one campaign completed at this time, but progressing through the story is a bit random.  It requires you to land on certain planets in some sort of order, but I am not sure which planets or what order that is.  But hey, the game is open source.  If you want to see more depth, you are welcome to contribute to completing those other campaigns.\nAnother thing to do early on is explore all of the systems, so you can map out the galaxy and plan your routes easier, however many planets will sell you a local area map which eliminates some of that exploring for a fairly low price.\n\nThough it bears no resemblance at all to FTL (no entering the ship and micromanaging crew details), I feel it would make for a decent roguelite and I have been playing it as such, deleting my profile every time I die.  Ironically, that is more enjoyable for me, in spite of the fact that the early game is so repetitive.  Not sure why.\n\nAll in all, if you don't mind unfinished projects, and like the idea of being an intergalactic merchant, there's very little reason to not give it a try.","December 30, 2015","true","21.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you want to play EV Nova, GO PLAY EV NOVA - to this day, there is no suitable replacement for the original Escape Velocity games, and although Endless Sky comes close mechanically, it falls short atmospherically. The original EV games still hold up so if you are like me, with a hankering for that old EV feeling, you might as well just go play one of the originals.\n\n[EDIT: I feel like I should just amend my review to say that Sunless Sea is a great modern game which is mechanically (if not thematically) similar to EV Nova and does a great job with atmosphere and writing, just with boats instead of space]\n\nI was dying to play some EV Nova so I thought I'd try this game. It is a very accurate clone of many of the aspects of the Escape Velocity series, right down to the button labels and some ship designs, but somehow it doesn't all come together. Combat in Endless Sky isn't something you engage in, it's just something that seems to -happen- and then you either die or your enemies die. Every time I engaged in combat it felt totally binary, as if nothing i did tactically would alter my chances of win/loss. The game seriously needs to have its combat stats rebalanced to slow things down (esp. in the early game) and allow more drawn-out tactical encounters.\n\nI did very much appreciate some of the improvements to the map/mission/trading interfaces, they make buy-low-sell-high a piece of cake with their profit/loss tracker. BUT, after several hours I actually found this detracted from one of the things I liked about Escape Velocity - the writing. It was so easy to fall into a trading groove that I actually found myself not even glancing at the planet and spaceport descriptions, and I found that after 12 hours I hadn't absorbed any of the flavor of the universe. Every planet became reduced to a set of pricing data. It just turns into a game of how-can-i-make-these-numbers-bigger.\n\nMy recommendation to other gamers is that instead of playing this game, you just find a copy of EV and play that. My recommendation to the developer of this game is to find a way to slow combat down and recapture the tension of EV (where did escape pods / hardmode go?).","February 20","false","13.8"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","4","16","0","5"

I first want to just say that I give the developer props for trying but unfortunately, the game just isn't for me. I don't understand the complaints about the visuals but I do unserstand the complaints about the controls. They're a little clunky and slow. I would generally be able to look over that if the game brought more to the table but unfortunately it just doesn't. My biggest issue is the cost of mortgage and rewards from missions. Rarely does the reward for the mission meet the cost of mortgage and leave enough left over to make decent money. Not only that, but the majority of missions are cargo based regardless of your ship type. As a fighter, I found that I often wouldn't have enough space whatsoever for many missions. That directly plays into the rewards. Granted, as was brought out to me, fighters are best for working at enemy ships. Overall, I have to say that this game isn't worth it for me, but, you may feel otherwise.

It's really ♥♥♥♥ing boring. The jumping system is tedious and has no real challenge getting from place to place. The loan you start out with is easily solved, and there is no real story in the game. The only "story" element in the game is with the republic and the free worlds. There are some very interesting alien races that you do not get to explore deeper (as far as I am aware) and no real back story to what's going on in the world. Progession takes forever and you will find yourself dying a bit. If you are unlucky enough to encounter the bug where your autosave doesn't register then whatever mission you are doing is automatically cancelled. I would not recommend this game.","November 1, 2015","false","3.8"," 6 of 25 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","6","25","0","0"

It's on Steam so it's  open to criticism.\n\nBasically, this game suffers the same weaknesses as almost all other Github games. It was developed in an echochamber by entitled coder(s) with apparently little playtesting or outside player input, and the end result is a bunch of code that doesn't interact well. Lots of mechanics work against each other, and the game is barely playable as a result.\n\nThe problem with Github is that the average Github coder is a self-proclaimed creator who neither plays the game he helps create or listens to player input. The command structure is basic and not even the person who approves code merges bothers to playtest what he approves. As a result, Github games are always going to be barely playable messes. I liken Github to Communism: Wonderful in theory, completely dysfunctional and prone to failure in reality.\n\n>all enemies will shoot the player craft into disabled mode, but not destroy purposefully\n>pirates are completely ineffectual, random spawn mob enemies that die without accomplishment\n>there is no difference between police and military, all government vessels are massive warships\n>pirates only seek to disable other ships, nearly all other ships destroy pirates without attempting to loot\n>the random ship spawn mechanic is not remotely balanced\n\nWouldn't play if it wasn't free, and it's unfinished Github fodder that doesn't belong on Steam.","November 4, 2015","false","106.6"," 8 of 31 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","8","31","0","1"

Follow the yellow brick road that all the other planets are connected to?\n\nCause that REALLY helped, not, I kept following each and every one that the lines are connected to on the map and all we ever did was end up finding more pirates.

Seriously a game without sound ? I looked up the Menu again but it was ON... The dialogue isn't spoken either, so there is absolutely NO sound ! When you start off with getting a loan, buying your first ship and meeting an old man it's still like: "Okay I am curious what this will turn into".\n\nBut the old man also says he will learn you the basics. Which NEVER happens. I was flying for a couple of minutes in a random direction. Never saw any distance / radar change (something I bought straight away in the game). The old man didn't tell me what to look out for, nor how to shoot. The controls are weird. Arrow keys to rotate/go faster and the Tab key to shoot the lasers.\n\nSound would help a lot already I guess. Spoken Dialogues as well.

Once you get the hang of the basic controls, you can rack up money fairly quickly.\n\nTips\n-Always buy the local map when you can, it will save you a lot of time.\n-Start with the cargo ship, because transporting cargo is a steady way to make money. When you have some extra money, buy the cargo expansion and get an extra 15 slots for cargo, or chip away at the debt at the bank.\n-A quick way to gain money is to find missions for cargo that are within 4-5 jumps. Take a look 1-2 jumps ahead to see what item will give you the most profit per unit, fill up on that, and go to that station, then repeat until you reach your destination.\n-Cargo transports are like buying low and selling high, but you get the cargo for free, so the profit is WAY higher.\n\n-How I started was with the cargo ship, and when I had about 500k extra, I bought another cargo ship like the one I started with. I got about 3-4 of them, then bought a small fighter to add to the group, they fight automatically.\n\n-Open map with M, select a place to go to, but make sure ALL your ships have enough fuel to make it, you get refills by stopping at a planet.\n-Use J to set all your ships to go to that place, they'll keep going until they get to the zone, but once you get there, make sure to hit L, or your ship will drift endlessly until you turn around to stop the momentum, or give it the land command with L.\n\nFun time killing game. Once I upgraded to bigger cargo ships that had blaster turrets, they were like self-defending cargo transports. I love it. With 5-6 of those things, little pirates fly by and get rekt.","December 16, 2015","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Whether or not I can buy the stupidly monstrous carrier or capital ship is always a good indicator of whether or not the developers love themselves, and apparently these guys do.\n\nThe art design is STELLARPUN and the UI is very clean and relatively easy to read. The lore background given for each and every planet is intricately detailed, which I am genuinely surprised to see, and reflects the developers' dedication to this game. The gameplay is relatively simple, incredibly simple if you plan on only trading, but you can make it as challenging as you want, which is a rare feature to offer that isn't a difficulty slider in the settings menu. This, paired with the branching dialogue options make this game a very solid space rpg.\n\ntl;dr I would pay money for this game, the quality is so good.Also because capital ships.\n\nIf I were to nitpick at this good FREE game, I would say that travelling in general is too hands-off and could get boring after a period of time, but aside from that, this game is a diamond in the rough.

I have always had a special place in my heart for space "sim" games, and while this one may not have the fanciest graphics or 6DOF flight mechanics, it still is more enjoyable to play, in my opinion , than most other space sim games. While the game may revolve around warfare, transporting people and goods, it also starts you out deep in the hole; somewhere around -400k net worth. Working to pay off that loan is not impossibly hard, but still slightly annoying nonetheless. You even have a credit score involved with paying off the loan, so like in real life, pay it off fast to avoid a ton of interest and get that high credit score so you can get loans for newer and better ships if you so choose.\nOverall, I feel like I would have happily payed up to about 10$ to support the devs of this game; I am still perplexed as to how it is 100% free of even microtransactions.\nSo far, game is, for me 7.5/10\n\n\nI would like to add in one more thing, can there be a toggle function or something along those lines that wont warp your flagship unless the rest of the ships in your fleet are ready and aligned to go? It really gets me in trouble sometimes as a trader. Thanks","October 31, 2015","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For something free and 2D, this space sim is legitimately fun.\n\nPros:\nBuilding a frickin' fleet feels awesome.\nDecent storyline.\nFactions.\nVariety in spaceships.\nTrading system is decent.\nGettin' money, performin' a karate chop move on women.\n\nCons:\nCombat feels...dull.\nWhere is the story?\nWhat to do after I'm rich?\nWhat's the end goal?\n\nLet me praise this game for doing some things well; Trading is fun, making money feels fun, story is better than expected, and playing the game as a merchant/bounty hunter is really fun. Most of the game feels fun, but it lacks in some departments. Firefights? They feel...meh. Keep back and shoot missiles or get in their face with a huge ship and turrets. I don't know what else to say besides it feels pretty meh. Next, where is the story? Everynow and then, I'll encounter a mission, but then, nothing. Days, weeks, months go by, and there's no story missions to be found. Without them, the grind goes on and on and it feels like all my progress has been for nothing. Story missions should be closer together and easier to find and do, otherwise it leaves the player without a sense of purpose, which leads to, "why am I even playing this?" Also, if you don't get that thought, you'll be at a point like me, with a ton of large warships, and nothing to do. Also, the biggest warships seem a little week. That aside, once you're on top, there's nothing to do afterwards. I haven't "beaten" the game, because I know there are story missions that I haven't found. I'm just stuck, and that's what it feels like the entire game has been building to.\n\nCriticisms aside, the game is still fun, for a while. The developers seem to be hard at work, there were new ships within a week after I started, so I think that's awesome. The game is worth following, and playing, but after a while, you may find yourself stuck, with loads of money and nothing to do. It's boring, and the issue should be tackled soon. I can't wait to see what the future holds for this game. My sincere regards to the devs for making a great game like this. Ciao.","December 21, 2015","true","50.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, right now it really lacks the polish that would make it fun. For instance, there's a reason Escape Velocity prevented you from making a hyperspace jump too close to the center of a system: without it this restriction, traffic moves too fast, and systems lack a sense of structure and atmosphere. Heck, even the asteroids move too fast. Combat is ridiculously fast, too. I can't learn anything from it, or even have fun running away from a much more powerful enemy and getting killed anyway—you just get zapped and die.\n\nI don't regret giving this a shot, and I think it has potential, but I don't recommend it right now. Modders will probably love it, though.","December 21, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Upon finding this game, I was more excited about playing it than any other game in recent memory, and it lived up to my expectations. That's not to say it has no creativity though. The developer did some things that I thought were really cool (like added a way to find weapons and ships from the map), and some things that I personally wouldn't have done (took out specialty commodities, likely because these are also visible from the map), but overall is a fantastic package. The string I played even has a solid story that is up to the high standard set by the EV games. Would highly recommend, and the fact that it's free makes it a no-brainer. I wish I could donate.\n\nIn the instance that this is read by a creator, I'd say it would be cool to consider adding specialty commodities back in, but excluding them from the map interface. Just a thought. Other than that thanks so much for doing what I wish I could have done myself, and make the EV series live on.","February 17","true","97.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's certainly got a little effort put into it - and it's free to boot. But on the flip side it's not a game anyone would have paid to play.\n\nIt's certainly addicting and plays heavy on the psychological urge to make the numbers grow - I played 8 hours of this yet I feel like I just started the game - but there's nothing I can honestly point out and say "that was fun" about those 8 hours spent. Just a compelling urge to get back to it to make money and get better ships.\n\nThe combat is over nearly the instant it begins. If you get attacked the game is already decided as there's no actual time to think or react; before you can even visually see an enemy you often get shot from offscreen by a torpedo or rapidly hit by a fighter's beams in a way that just kills you inside 2-4 seconds of popping into the system. If you buy escort ships they can defend you, but the combat is over too fast for you (the human-controlled ship) to actually participate in any meaningful way.\n\nThere are quests that spice the game up a little bit with story if you stop off in some spaceports. They're not terribly different than other jobs you can get in actual function, but you get a little story to go with the game.\n\nThe greater part of this game is just grabbing junk from one place and selling it in another place. Pirates show up at times and typically - if you're alone - they kill you before you can do anything about it.The game isn't brutal though. It autosaves everytime you land on a planet so if you die it's barely an inconvienence.\n\nIt's a free game so you can't really go wrong giving it a shot.","December 2, 2015","true","23.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Of course, Endless Sky is still in development, with only part of the actual story mission done, but the story it does offer at this moment is top of the notch.

For something free and 2D, this space sim is legitimately fun.\n\nPros:\nBuilding a frickin' fleet feels awesome.\nDecent storyline.\nFactions.\nVariety in spaceships.\nTrading system is decent.\nGettin' money, performin' a karate chop move on women.\n\nCons:\nCombat feels...dull.\nWhere is the story?\nWhat to do after I'm rich?\nWhat's the end goal?\n\nLet me praise this game for doing some things well; Trading is fun, making money feels fun, story is better than expected, and playing the game as a merchant/bounty hunter is really fun. Most of the game feels fun, but it lacks in some departments. Firefights? They feel...meh. Keep back and shoot missiles or get in their face with a huge ship and turrets. I don't know what else to say besides it feels pretty meh. Next, where is the story? Everynow and then, I'll encounter a mission, but then, nothing. Days, weeks, months go by, and there's no story missions to be found. Without them, the grind goes on and on and it feels like all my progress has been for nothing. Story missions should be closer together and easier to find and do, otherwise it leaves the player without a sense of purpose, which leads to, "why am I even playing this?" Also, if you don't get that thought, you'll be at a point like me, with a ton of large warships, and nothing to do. Also, the biggest warships seem a little week. That aside, once you're on top, there's nothing to do afterwards. I haven't "beaten" the game, because I know there are story missions that I haven't found. I'm just stuck, and that's what it feels like the entire game has been building to.\n\nCriticisms aside, the game is still fun, for a while. The developers seem to be hard at work, there were new ships within a week after I started, so I think that's awesome. The game is worth following, and playing, but after a while, you may find yourself stuck, with loads of money and nothing to do. It's boring, and the issue should be tackled soon. I can't wait to see what the future holds for this game. My sincere regards to the devs for making a great game like this.

However, right now it really lacks the polish that would make it fun. For instance, there's a reason Escape Velocity prevented you from making a hyperspace jump too close to the center of a system: without it this restriction, traffic moves too fast, and systems lack a sense of structure and atmosphere. Heck, even the asteroids move too fast. Combat is ridiculously fast, too. I can't learn anything from it, or even have fun running away from a much more powerful enemy and getting killed anyway—you just get zapped and die.\n\nI don't regret giving this a shot, and I think it has potential, but I don't recommend it right now.

Once you get the hang of the basic controls, you can rack up money fairly quickly.\n\nTips\n-Always buy the local map when you can, it will save you a lot of time.\n-Start with the cargo ship, because transporting cargo is a steady way to make money. When you have some extra money, buy the cargo expansion and get an extra 15 slots for cargo, or chip away at the debt at the bank.\n-A quick way to gain money is to find missions for cargo that are within 4-5 jumps. Take a look 1-2 jumps ahead to see what item will give you the most profit per unit, fill up on that, and go to that station, then repeat until you reach your destination.\n-Cargo transports are like buying low and selling high, but you get the cargo for free, so the profit is WAY higher.\n\n-How I started was with the cargo ship, and when I had about 500k extra, I bought another cargo ship like the one I started with. I got about 3-4 of them, then bought a small fighter to add to the group, they fight automatically.\n\n-Open map with M, select a place to go to, but make sure ALL your ships have enough fuel to make it, you get refills by stopping at a planet.\n-Use J to set all your ships to go to that place, they'll keep going until they get to the zone, but once you get there, make sure to hit L, or your ship will drift endlessly until you turn around to stop the momentum, or give it the land command with L.\n\nFun time killing game. Once I upgraded to bigger cargo ships that had blaster turrets, they were like self-defending cargo transports. I love it. With 5-6 of those things, little pirates fly by and get rekt.","December 16, 2015","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

None of my games have been up to par to what I want to play.  Honestly I am glad I did.  It may be a casual game, however, it has some nice graphics for a 2D game.  I started playing it, and the only things I have found to be flaws are as follows:\n\n1) The 'main' plotline can be a bit hard to find if you don't always check the spaceports.  Even then, those space ports can be very hard to find due to the vastness of the star system of the game.  Just a minor drawback, still it has a very catchy story so far what I have seen.  I won't spoil it too much but you can side with at least two factions from what I have seen.  THere are at least 5 factions I have found.  Including one that eluded me for the longest time actually.\n\n2) Controls could be a bit more universal and the starter ship is a bit hard to control.  However that starter ship will do mostly running away till you can afford a new ship.(which can take a while to do)  Just remember, don't go into 'dead space' with only 1-2 bars of fuel.  Unless you know there is an inhabited spot in distance to get too.  You can refill from allied ships but due to me just testing mechanics and what not, I did get stuck ina  spot where only pirates were and they wouldn't help even after paying a bribe.\n\n3) Found a bug that if you actualy ahve a fleet of ships and you jump before they leave the planet and join you.  They will actualy be stuck in an endless loop going in and out of the planet.  However if you multi jump with all ships in space, they will actualy stop for refuels if they don't have the same amount of fuel.\n\n4) The economy.  I don't know if this gets better in time, but due to the storyline I would say it would for someone of your stature(Unless the faction you chose can be a money grubbing -Insert favorite derogatory here-)  You start off paying off 450k of a loan with 0.400% intrest and it is near impossible to pay on time every time.  SO it takes a while to get rid of that first ship.  After that however, money is rather easy if you play it JUSSST right.  So a slight more ballancing will be needed on that.\n\nAll in all however, this game is a must have.  It may be casual, but if you go hardcore on it, oh my does it get quite interesting.","November 2, 2015","true","79.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This does several things better than EV, and there are things that EV does much better.\n\nES's strengths:\nI really like the finance system in ES much more than just simple credits. I personally wish that the loan system was more complex than it is currently, but I know that this wouldn't be as accessible for everybody. I was very delighted to see how the finances worked.\nI also really like how the trade system works. Every planet has a "Trade Center," which isn't available in EV. This allows a TON of flexibility when it comes to trade routes. This functionality works great in conjunction with the features of the Map.\nThe Map has MUCH more features than EV's. For one, in addition to the great trade options listed above, the map will display prices for each commodity in each system, and compare it with the prices of your current system! This is an AMAZING feature!!!! It also color-codes each system in regards to the actual prices of each commodity. This will let you supercharge trade routes with only a few clicks. It also lets you search for planets and systems that sell specific outfits and ships. Want a Laser Turret? Find a system that's guaranteed to sell Laser Turrets easily!\nAnd, it's free.\n\nEV's Strengths:\nMost noticibly, EV's presentation and gameplay are smoother, especially when talking about EV Nova. The art and assets really stand out. Details within the ships' and planets' design give the world a ton of personality that you can really feel. The quick, tight controls of the fighters and the sluggish, aching turn of the heavy freighters are felt as much as seen. Each world has much more personality and diversity than ES's worlds. The planets aren't just described through the text, but their consistency is maintained through the art on the planet and the profile of the world from space. It's all consistent, and that makes you feel like you're actually traveling the stars. It's something Ambrosia is really good at creating. EV also has several government types, each with their own quirks. The political territories feel completely different from one another. Being in Federal space is obvious, and being in Rebel space is obvious. In any EV game, you can immediately tell which faction's space you're in instantaniously.\nEV is definitely a more hands-on game, which I perfer. ES is basically an autopilot flier. You can take manual control if you'd like - such as for combat purposes - but you don't need to. EV's controls require you to stay engaged with the world, and therein makes you immersed in the story. If I'm doing cargo runs in ES, I can set up my route, hit "J" and walk away for a full minute while I wait for the series of jumps to complete. That wait time breaks the immersion of the game. And speaking of story, EV Nova actually has stories; several stories are strung throughout the galaxy - each one unique. You can travel through these stories to pick up a ton of great gear, ships, modifications, etc. to become really powerful! As ar as I can tell, ES doesn't have any of those.\nThe weapons in ES don't feel like their as varied as EV. I couldn't tell the difference between a blaster shot and a modified blaster shot if I saw them both in combat.\nFinally, ES's galaxy is extremely small. I explored every corner of the galaxy in about 3 hours.\n\nNow all the above being said, this is a really good tribute, and definitely worth your time. I'm really impressed with how it was all put together. This gets my thumbs-up, and I plan on recommending this to my friends.","November 2, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It kinda saddens me that this kind of game concepts are pretty much ignored by the AAA studios and publishers, because I'd love to see a game where I could do all of this in first person. (Star Citizen, maybe?)\nTeh arbitrary list of pros and cons goes here:\n\nPros:\n- An original sci-fi world with its own lore, locales, races, thingmagajigs etc. Lots of descriptions, random events and tiny detail you could admire for hours and hours...\n\n- The game leaves the exploration and discovery to you and there's direct benefits as well as risks to it. I know its hard to achieve with the level of writing shown here, but I kinda wish there was a random map generator and/or more rogue-like elements for additional replay value.\n\n-The learning/grinding curve feels rough and tedious at times, but it's never unfair other than in the way you'd expect it\nto be. (You're a lone, debt-ridden pilot in space, anyone could be your enemy if you decide to make them one...)\n\n-You can be a transporter or a merchant and moreover, it's profitable and compelling enough on its own, you never feel like the story or the gameplay is forcing any of the combat and conflict on you. (This is what practically every other sci-fi -themed, or rather, every other videogame is guilty of...)\n\n-It's not like they forgot about conflict either, sure you can become a space pirate or a bounty hunter, even a scout if you will, but it's way more risky than being a merchant, and rightly so.\n\nCons:\n- Combat is clunky, you feel like inertia is your main enemy, as you and your opponent spin around in awkward circles  briefly barraging each other with your weapons before flying off in separate directions... (Most of of the time is easier to avoid fighting all together, and true enough, transporters and freighters are not even designed for combat, but having it in there, I'd love if it was a bit more accessible to a new player, since I don't feel any sort of motivation to try and learn about combat in its current form.)\n\n- "Everything is ready for you.." This is kind of hard to pin down and sure, a lot of it is convenient and makes sense from the 'viewpoint of a game' but it's still kind of iffy how you never have trouble finding wares to sell off in other systems, or nice, paying passengers that won't mind even if you take a detour here or there, missions for a lone hauler with no-one to protect their freight and so on. (I'd say there's lots of room for additional writing and game design here, maybe a 'hardcore mode' of sorts too if some of the features prove too harsh for the casual player.)\n\n- This one is probably the hardest one to explain, but in writer's terms it goes like: 'Does your story tell about the most interesting time of your protagonist's life and if not, why?' At the era presented in the game, a lot of space is already discovered, and although space pirates still roam about, the age of corporate warfare has largely passed, and overall, space is a lot more of a peaceful and prosperous of a place that what it used to be. Sure, it makes for an easier livelihood if you're a lawful merchant, but let's say for an example, wouldn't it have been more interesting to be a pilot at the time of discovery or a smuggler at the 'end times', scraping against the law and corporations to make meets end in a rat race for scarsening resources... (Okay, not that I should try and pretend being a sci-fi writer or anything, but just saying that additional eras to play in could also be a nice addition. Or an easily accessible 'lore/map editor' perhaps? My bad if there already is one... Yup, there already is one. Maybe I'll have to get writing and see what I can do about that 'end times' era.)","November 4, 2015","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Grab and you wont loose any, apart for some few HDD storage and most of your time if you're gonna enjoy it.\n\nso far it's eating me for nearly 5 hours and i've done some quite some good stuff with a freighter recently and a wasp interceptor which is somehow handy. Loving the system on how you'll earn around here, people for transport are around, tag along with a small couple ton of cargo for some extra. Or you could freight on cargo around the system, funny thing is it's pretty realistic because price/rate doesn't change on every system, its fixed as is so you could farm as long as you want. Or choose the tough life being a pirate or savior of tiny ships to gigantic cruisers/freighters, they are scattered everywhere, but pirates mostly have their own crib so you can farm them as well.\n\nI haven't tried the fighter/intercept ship yet but it seems you could do that role with bigger defense power. I tried first the transport role but took on high reward but unknown systems/location so i dont know the route available and got stuck, with freight i took those only i can go around with reasonable reward, and explore place when provided with extra money.\n\nThought its multiplayer, but frankly it aint, but i guess it's alright so no bullying or whatsover might occur, although think of the possibilities! it's more of a strategy-sim-economic game i guess, this game has alot of possibilities and im looking forward to it. Perhaps more game modes or extras so that it wont get repetitive, because that's what i feel in the long run, but i know this game will reach places!

I had a wasp fighter get shot down, and upon reloading from the last planet as the game instructs my screen freezes on that same wasp fighter and makes it my flagship whenever I pass through that system so I lose control of whatever fleet I bring through.  I also lose whatever credits I spent purchasing newer ships as they somehow get stuck in that system as well and don't show up in my fleet when I reload. With no real tutorial that I've seen, the storyline quests can be pretty dumb and time consuming so essentially you just wind up cruising the stars hoping to earn enough credits to buy bigger and better ships. Not bad, a good time killer but that's about it - good thing it's free because it would be a joke if you had to spend any money on it.

This game has so much potential to be such a great game. Let's give this game some time and see how this game progress from here on out. At the moment, this game needs some new content like new titles for the faction you're in for like bragging rights? Maybe perhaps allow the raiding and protecting of the space stations and colonies? Another way to secure an income for cash like mining minerals in space and selling them at the marketplace in planets? I would love some achievements too if it is not too much to ask for. An AI enemy would be nice too like an enigmatic alien race pillaging and raiding for some unknown motive could be foreshadowing for some really awesome storyline! Even a unsophisticated stats screen would be nice to monitor progress/progression. Documenting this game in its early stages is one of life's simplest pleasures that i derive from.

And evolve with the profits you generate?!\nWelcome to Endless Sky!\n\nHonestly, the graphics (and the looong list of commands) kept me away from the game for a while. It is only after I noticed we could barely use 3 keys (J, L, M by default) and have an unexplicable amount of fun during this game.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple, but I honestly can't recommend this game enough. It's a very thrilling experience between travelling space, recruiting ships/crew, accomplishing missions, fighting/fleeing pirates, joining a clan...\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- The other ships in the game are extremely random. Some planets are very calm, and one second after, they become raging with pirates and Republican resistance... Instant kills are in order!\n- No real story, really. The first missions show you how to navigate and play (some sort of tutorial) and then, nothing else. Just a bunch of exploding ships...\n- The ships you buy are default. No customization possible on their skins (though you can buy wepaons and stuff on them, still not accurate though since that takes up place from the merchandise too)\n\nWhat kept me playing for hours now:\n- Money! Money! MONEY! It's what keeps you farming circuits for hours!\n- 3 keys to manage it all; some sort of pre-built autopilot for your ship.\n- Reading about the planets and discovering new horizons. Each system has a planet or more with different stories. It's just amazing how much work was put in that!\n- The map is EXTREMELY, I say EXTREMELY WELL OPTIMIZED!! If you get to know it, everything is shown from missions, nearby planets with their economy, destination, where you should and should not go! It's the MOST amazing map in a ES clone-game I've ever seen!\n- Have a fleet, conquer space! Satisfy your ego!\n- Free open-source game!

It's a weird mix basically you start from the bottom as a common man with no space knowlage and you take out a 480,000 credit loan to buy your first ship. You can choose a fighter-most expensive useless because it's such a low class fighter, Freight ship-amazing best one to get and can really get you started, the carrier ship people transport ugly potato thing-good but worse than a freighter because bulk deliveries get you a ton of money\n\n1. I got a fighter it looked cool and saw in controls board ship so I tried to take on even one pirate got him barely other pirate came and killed me\n2. reloaded the last save died again like 5 times\n3. sold my fighter for the carrier thing and slowly made money 30,000 credits at a time\n4. I looked at the prices I got a small cargo ship for 1.1 million credits the turrets on it made me cocky and I finally captured a small pirate fighter that I sold for 460,000 credits.\n5. I upgraded my cargo ship to the 2.5 million hauler I was between a person transport and a cargo transport but cargo bus way easier money so I went with that.\n6. My upgrades on the ship were all combat related for some reason I thought a cargo ship was decent for fighting pirated but I could only take out 3 small pirates at a time\n7. I died and reloaded the save like 400 times until I made about 1 million credits sold my hauler and bought my first light warship\n8. I could take out most pirates and I upgraded the living bejesus out of that ship\n9. Pirates started coming at me 10 at a time I got rekt doing escort about 50 times\n10. guy offered money for me to transport illegal drugs and I did it\n11. I got 90k credits and a republic prick caught me and fined me 20k but I didn't care\n12. I upgraded to a 5.5 million credit light warship and upgraded it\n13. I took out a HUGE battleship with the help of my escort and when I was about to board it and capture it to use a republic a**hole came and blew it up\n14. I slaughtered him and ran from about 400 massive capital ships\n15. This is where I am now the one lesson I have learned is NEVER take out loans if you are just messing around I had to kill an escort to pay for those loans man the struggles\n8.5/10 I can't wait for them to add more content and maybe some music because right now after some times it can get a bit boring but overall an amazing game and especially amazing for one thats FREE!!!! and just came out.

I choose a Freighter as my starting ship, and began running small time delivery missions across the galaxy. No sweat. Eventually i had enough for a better quality freighter. Rackin in some serious cash. Before I realised it, i had my own little merchant fleet of 3 Freighters. Pirates were never really too much of an issue. I was lucky. Until... On a simple escort mission 2 jumps from my location, I was bum rushed by Pirate scumbags. I knew I couldnt fight them off as they were some serious high tech ♥♥♥♥, So I cut my losses and left my second ship, The "Deliverance" to be taken by the Pirates. God bless the crew. Upon turning in the mission, turns out the Pirates had tagged along into an empty sector of space where only me and my last remaining Freighter floated harmlessly. We didnt even bring down a single pirate ship before I heard the lovely sound of my ships interior exploding outwards into the void of Pirate infested space.\n\nRIP Merchant ships, Deliverance, Oppertunity, and Void Runner. You shall be missed.\n\nReally though. The game is addictive, and free. No pesky microtransactions. The gameplay itself is somewhat confusing at first but youll get the hang of it in time. The pirates are unforgiving and at times ridiculously frustrating, as you can be stuck reloading your save trying to escape a system where they can wipe you, and your escorts out in moments.\n\nAside from this, the detail in the game is great. alot of story elements erry'where. Its a good time.\n\nTL;DR\n\nFun game with graphics a toaster connected to a gameboy color could run, With detailed information on planets and factions. Just beware of the ♥♥♥♥ING PIRATES.\nAnd no ingame microtransactions, so you dont need your wallet.\nVery small download size for those like me who have unreliable snail-speed, or an internet limit.\n\nDownload it. Aside from the emotional harm in losing a fleet, theres no downside.","November 5, 2015","true","21.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is a 2D sci-fi game where you start off buying your first ship (after taking a sizeable loan just over 420k) you meet people in spaceports that give you quests you can choose your career of a trader,cruise ship captain,bounty hunter, freedom fighter, pirate, the list goes on. It's really dependant on your style of play. I opted to be a frieghter captain contracting my services for stable income and occasionally disabling small pirate craft and taking all their equipment. After awhile you pay off your loan and really your story depends on where you head off too. Shortly after my first mission I took a contract that took my south of the starting area and as i delivered my cargo i checked the spaceport and ended up being recruited by some of the free fighters to observe some systems. I further assisted them recieving a nice profit for good work nothing too bad just a smuggling of a person here and there. Overall the missions you get are well written in my opinion as well as some of your responces (I did the karate move for kicks fyi). The ship and module variaty seemed quite low at first untill i realized duh your not gonna have a planet selling every ship variaty. I started exploring and bam many new ships and modules were discovered. However the UI for the modules could use a little more clarity ( thought i might sell my ship by selling a module at first) but after about 15-30 minutes you get the hang of it. So for a free game 10/10 there is no downside to downloading this game since it's so small. If i had to pay for this game i might pause since the combat seems a little harsh some times (but hey i was a freighter not a fighter so i cant judge to harshly) still if they asked under 5$ it would still be reasonable the universe is quiet well crafted. Why are you still reading this hit the download button and play it now! STOP READING AND PLAY NOW!!!","November 5, 2015","true","26.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything, the mechanics, the gameplay, even the graphics are great (for what it is). There's no substantial complaints about gameplay or bugs.\nThe first thing I would love to be added to this game is the ability to join more factions. Currently there is only one faction that has a story line you can play, and from what I understand, the developer is working on making more factions playable.\nThe second thing is multiplayer. Right now the game is turn-based (landing or going into hyperspace counts as a "day"), but I would absolutely *love* to see a multiplayer mode become available. The dev has already spoken about how he will NOT add multiplayer, but I think it would add a much higher level of replayability to this game if, in addition to the single-player campaign mode, there were a player-driven multiplayer mode as well.\nThe last thing (and this is a bit of a stretch) I would love to see would be a mobile port of this game. It runs fantastically on any (and I mean *any*) sort of hardware, given its simple graphical nature. A mobile port (to iOS, Android, AND Windows mobile) would infinitely increase this game's success and exposure, and I would adore playing this on my phone.\nOh, and don't forget Steam Workshop support. The dev has also spoken about this explaining the modding on Endless Sky uses a different system than Steam Workshop's but this would also make the game much more fantastic.\nOverall this game is a simple space sim that has SO much potential in it, and I'm excited to see where the developer takes it.","November 4, 2015","true","93.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No bugs to report. Some minor missing art here and there in the shopping screen but all in all a very good game. After playing through the masterfully written quest line (with player choices & a very big and noticeable impact on the universe!) the game feels a bit empty due to there being no real way to conquer the universe besides making planets pay a daily fee after destroying their fleet. And no way to spend the ridiculous amount of money you can make. As soon as you are rich getting a lot richer is a piece of cake. But definitely a solid 30-50 hours of very enjoyable gameplay.

The only break I took was for eating dinner ^^\nWhen i first saw this, and read the description, I didn't completely expect what I got. There isn't as much of that exploration-feeling as I thought there would be, as most systems are inhabited. Those which aren't are therefore violent traps you will most probably die within in the first minute. At least with the beginning ship. But even inhabited and highly guarded systems are (in seldom cases) attacked by pirates or other enemies, which makes you to never feel completely safe...\n\nPros:\n- Neat graphics\n- no bugs or glitches\n- no lags, even at highest settings\n- editors for map and ships (which means, you can edit everything)\n- interesting upgrades system, using several kinds of slots\n- customizing your ship is very easy\n- tutorial mission showing you everything, even how deadly space can be...\n- the story can be ignored by the player, or changed, but events always take effect on you\n- several possibilities for better engines/weapons/other components\n- galaxywide market system incorporating your buying/selling decisions into the prices\n\nCons\n- no multiplayer ( which isn't really needed, I just wanted to have something on contra side :D )\n\nConclusion:\nAn awesome space game, completely free of bugs and lags, just as you would want a new game to be :)\n\nUpdate 11/8: Still no bugs, I have already played around with plugins a little. That's also the way I obtained a fleet of several alien spaceships, even some Quarg ships.","November 5, 2015","true","28.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is a fine difference between having your hand held as your lead down a completely linear experience (ala Call of Duty) and not actually telling the player how to use even basic controls. For example, the game told how to open up your star map by hitting M to select a star system and that you jump to that system by hittingJ. What the game didn't tell me was that you had to actually EXIT your star map, THEN hit J to jump to the system.\nAs I said, you will randomly (and rarely) find quests if you visit the space port in each system, but nothing in the game even alludes to this fact, I found that out by accident. Also, you have to hold the space bar to quick buy a large amount of things in the trading area, which again I learned by accident (before that I was clicking for each and every piece of metal I was buying up).\n-Combat is random, not all that interesting, and is always one sided one way or another. Pirates will randomly appear in a sector. If your a fighter, you turn your ship and fire your weapons at the enemy and hope they die before you do. If you are in a freighter, your guns turn so you don't have to (although freighters really suck at turning anyway) and again, you have to hope they die before you do. Either a single pirate ship will jump into a system teaming with a dozen friendly ships and die immediately, or six pirates will jump on you as your leaving a planet and blast you to bits without you being able to do anything. Death just makes you reload back to whatever planet you were last landed on, but that only highlights what a nusance combat in this game is.\n\nStill, on the whole the game is one of the most immersive games I have played in years, and it is VERY easy to lose an embaressingly large amount of time to this game.","November 7, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It kinda saddens me that this kind of game concepts are pretty much ignored by the AAA studios and publishers, because I'd love to see a game where I could do all of this in first person. (Star Citizen, maybe?)\nTeh arbitrary list of pros and cons goes here:\n\nPros:\n- An original sci-fi world with its own lore, locales, races, thingmagajigs etc. Lots of descriptions, random events and tiny detail you could admire for hours and hours...\n\n- The game leaves the exploration and discovery to you and there's direct benefits as well as risks to it. I know its hard to achieve with the level of writing shown here, but I kinda wish there was a random map generator and/or more rogue-like elements for additional replay value.\n\n-The learning/grinding curve feels rough and tedious at times, but it's never unfair other than in the way you'd expect it\nto be. (You're a lone, debt-ridden pilot in space, anyone could be your enemy if you decide to make them one...)\n\n-You can be a transporter or a merchant and moreover, it's profitable and compelling enough on its own, you never feel like the story or the gameplay is forcing any of the combat and conflict on you. (This is what practically every other sci-fi -themed, or rather, every other videogame is guilty of...)\n\n-It's not like they forgot about conflict either, sure you can become a space pirate or a bounty hunter, even a scout if you will, but it's way more risky than being a merchant, and rightly so.\n\nCons:\n- Combat is clunky, you feel like inertia is your main enemy, as you and your opponent spin around in awkward circles  briefly barraging each other with your weapons before flying off in separate directions... (Most of of the time is easier to avoid fighting all together, and true enough, transporters and freighters are not even designed for combat, but having it in there, I'd love if it was a bit more accessible to a new player, since I don't feel any sort of motivation to try and learn about combat in its current form.)\n\n- "Everything is ready for you.." This is kind of hard to pin down and sure, a lot of it is convenient and makes sense from the 'viewpoint of a game' but it's still kind of iffy how you never have trouble finding wares to sell off in other systems, or nice, paying passengers that won't mind even if you take a detour here or there, missions for a lone hauler with no-one to protect their freight and so on. (I'd say there's lots of room for additional writing and game design here, maybe a 'hardcore mode' of sorts too if some of the features prove too harsh for the casual player.)\n\n- This one is probably the hardest one to explain, but in writer's terms it goes like: 'Does your story tell about the most interesting time of your protagonist's life and if not, why?' At the era presented in the game, a lot of space is already discovered, and although space pirates still roam about, the age of corporate warfare has largely passed, and overall, space is a lot more of a peaceful and prosperous of a place that what it used to be. Sure, it makes for an easier livelihood if you're a lawful merchant, but let's say for an example, wouldn't it have been more interesting to be a pilot at the time of discovery or a smuggler at the 'end times', scraping against the law and corporations to make meets end in a rat race for scarsening resources... (Okay, not that I should try and pretend being a sci-fi writer or anything, but just saying that additional eras to play in could also be a nice addition. Or an easily accessible 'lore/map editor' perhaps? My bad if there already is one... Yup, there already is one. Maybe I'll have to get writing and see what I can do about that 'end times' era.)","November 4, 2015","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

None of my games have been up to par to what I want to play.  Honestly I am glad I did.  It may be a casual game, however, it has some nice graphics for a 2D game.  I started playing it, and the only things I have found to be flaws are as follows:\n\n1) The 'main' plotline can be a bit hard to find if you don't always check the spaceports.  Even then, those space ports can be very hard to find due to the vastness of the star system of the game.  Just a minor drawback, still it has a very catchy story so far what I have seen.  I won't spoil it too much but you can side with at least two factions from what I have seen.  THere are at least 5 factions I have found.  Including one that eluded me for the longest time actually.\n\n2) Controls could be a bit more universal and the starter ship is a bit hard to control.  However that starter ship will do mostly running away till you can afford a new ship.(which can take a while to do)  Just remember, don't go into 'dead space' with only 1-2 bars of fuel.  Unless you know there is an inhabited spot in distance to get too.  You can refill from allied ships but due to me just testing mechanics and what not, I did get stuck ina  spot where only pirates were and they wouldn't help even after paying a bribe.\n\n3) Found a bug that if you actualy ahve a fleet of ships and you jump before they leave the planet and join you.  They will actualy be stuck in an endless loop going in and out of the planet.  However if you multi jump with all ships in space, they will actualy stop for refuels if they don't have the same amount of fuel.\n\n4) The economy.  I don't know if this gets better in time, but due to the storyline I would say it would for someone of your stature(Unless the faction you chose can be a money grubbing -Insert favorite derogatory here-)  You start off paying off 450k of a loan with 0.400% intrest and it is near impossible to pay on time every time.  SO it takes a while to get rid of that first ship.  After that however, money is rather easy if you play it JUSSST right.  So a slight more ballancing will be needed on that.\n\nAll in all however, this game is a must have.  It may be casual, but if you go hardcore on it, oh my does it get quite interesting.","November 2, 2015","true","79.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This does several things better than EV, and there are things that EV does much better.\n\nES's strengths:\nI really like the finance system in ES much more than just simple credits. I personally wish that the loan system was more complex than it is currently, but I know that this wouldn't be as accessible for everybody. I was very delighted to see how the finances worked.\nI also really like how the trade system works. Every planet has a "Trade Center," which isn't available in EV. This allows a TON of flexibility when it comes to trade routes. This functionality works great in conjunction with the features of the Map.\nThe Map has MUCH more features than EV's. For one, in addition to the great trade options listed above, the map will display prices for each commodity in each system, and compare it with the prices of your current system! This is an AMAZING feature!!!! It also color-codes each system in regards to the actual prices of each commodity. This will let you supercharge trade routes with only a few clicks. It also lets you search for planets and systems that sell specific outfits and ships. Want a Laser Turret? Find a system that's guaranteed to sell Laser Turrets easily!\nAnd, it's free.\n\nEV's Strengths:\nMost noticibly, EV's presentation and gameplay are smoother, especially when talking about EV Nova. The art and assets really stand out. Details within the ships' and planets' design give the world a ton of personality that you can really feel. The quick, tight controls of the fighters and the sluggish, aching turn of the heavy freighters are felt as much as seen. Each world has much more personality and diversity than ES's worlds. The planets aren't just described through the text, but their consistency is maintained through the art on the planet and the profile of the world from space. It's all consistent, and that makes you feel like you're actually traveling the stars. It's something Ambrosia is really good at creating. EV also has several government types, each with their own quirks. The political territories feel completely different from one another. Being in Federal space is obvious, and being in Rebel space is obvious. In any EV game, you can immediately tell which faction's space you're in instantaniously.\nEV is definitely a more hands-on game, which I perfer. ES is basically an autopilot flier. You can take manual control if you'd like - such as for combat purposes - but you don't need to. EV's controls require you to stay engaged with the world, and therein makes you immersed in the story. If I'm doing cargo runs in ES, I can set up my route, hit "J" and walk away for a full minute while I wait for the series of jumps to complete. That wait time breaks the immersion of the game. And speaking of story, EV Nova actually has stories; several stories are strung throughout the galaxy - each one unique. You can travel through these stories to pick up a ton of great gear, ships, modifications, etc. to become really powerful! As ar as I can tell, ES doesn't have any of those.\nThe weapons in ES don't feel like their as varied as EV. I couldn't tell the difference between a blaster shot and a modified blaster shot if I saw them both in combat.\nFinally, ES's galaxy is extremely small. I explored every corner of the galaxy in about 3 hours.\n\nNow all the above being said, this is a really good tribute, and definitely worth your time. I'm really impressed with how it was all put together. This gets my thumbs-up, and I plan on recommending this to my friends.","November 2, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But just as things seem bad, I started getting bounty hunter missions. So my weird custom city-ship is finally seeing some real combat.

I don't know why there are so many funny stories and compliments on the "realism" as this realism is extremely annoying. The game forces you to grind, grind, grind which is a huge negative. This could all be solved with removing the bank loan from the start of the game. The loan actually feels like a real home loan that takes 20 years to pay off.\n\nStarting as a Fighter I found the combat a huge let down right from the start. It's not fun and upgrading seems impossible.\n\nAfter exploring the galaxy, running Rush quests and having some rather terrible fights I have eventually given up. The only positive is the ability for others to add to the game. Unfortunately this is needed urgently as the game in its current format has 'too many holes leaking water'. Some new sounds like explosions and gun fire would be nice too.\n\nFor the love of the dark gods people, try playing the game before rating it.  Seriously!

While the game itself is simple, the caveat of actually learning it is daunting. I downloaded it last night, and already have 5.5 hours on record (Rolling the galaxy as a rush delivery courier in dual Carrier's). The graphics are simplistic, (I recommend the high DPI DLC), the actual gameplay is more taxing. Constantly balacing mortages, and crey payments on a day to day basis, while maintaining a high cash flow is what takes up most of my time. Now for the pros/cons list.\n\nPros:\nSmall download\nStraight forward gameplay\nMassive amount of NPCs to interact with.\nSound is good considering the game's theme of emulating a 2002 game.\nThe size of the area you are in.\nRandomly generated map on each new pilot.\nSkippable tutorial.\n\nCons:\nNew players may buy the Sparrow thinking I'm just going to go around and kill everything like a pirate, then find out EVERYONE is much bigger than you, with bigger weapons. Some trial and error is involved.\nHyperspace jumping is one tile at a time, so it takes quite a long time to get anywhere\nBuying anything but a cargo ship at the beginning basically means death, as the real money is made shipping things.\nTutorials are a bit lacking, even including the wiki.\nOutfitters are few and far between.\nNot telling players "BUY THE STAR MAP WHENEVER YOU SEE AN OUTFITTER" makes new players a bit lost on how to get around.\n\nAll in all, after you get past the learning curve of how to play, the game is quite enjoyable.\n4.5/5","November 2, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Decent Graphics, Simple Controls, Great mechanics, and a not-too-shabby 'tutorial'.\nThere are a few drawbacks, though. Replayability is a bit on the low side, as progression is a bit slow and you end up doing very similar missions over and over until you have a ship capable of actually fighting Pirates, which can take a while to get.\nThere is an occaisional bug here and there, but other than that the game runs smoothly.\n\nAside from the progression issues, I see potential in this game. I love how you can run out of fuel in an uninhabited sector and have to call a nearby merchant for help. I like the money system, how you can ferry goods from one place to another to earn a profit.

It kinda saddens me that this kind of game concepts are pretty much ignored by the AAA studios and publishers, because I'd love to see a game where I could do all of this in first person. (Star Citizen, maybe?)\nTeh arbitrary list of pros and cons goes here:\n\nPros:\n- An original sci-fi world with its own lore, locales, races, thingmagajigs etc. Lots of descriptions, random events and tiny detail you could admire for hours and hours...\n\n- The game leaves the exploration and discovery to you and there's direct benefits as well as risks to it. I know its hard to achieve with the level of writing shown here, but I kinda wish there was a random map generator and/or more rogue-like elements for additional replay value.\n\n-The learning/grinding curve feels rough and tedious at times, but it's never unfair other than in the way you'd expect it\nto be. (You're a lone, debt-ridden pilot in space, anyone could be your enemy if you decide to make them one...)\n\n-You can be a transporter or a merchant and moreover, it's profitable and compelling enough on its own, you never feel like the story or the gameplay is forcing any of the combat and conflict on you. (This is what practically every other sci-fi -themed, or rather, every other videogame is guilty of...)\n\n-It's not like they forgot about conflict either, sure you can become a space pirate or a bounty hunter, even a scout if you will, but it's way more risky than being a merchant, and rightly so.\n\nCons:\n- Combat is clunky, you feel like inertia is your main enemy, as you and your opponent spin around in awkward circles  briefly barraging each other with your weapons before flying off in separate directions... (Most of of the time is easier to avoid fighting all together, and true enough, transporters and freighters are not even designed for combat, but having it in there, I'd love if it was a bit more accessible to a new player, since I don't feel any sort of motivation to try and learn about combat in its current form.)\n\n- "Everything is ready for you.." This is kind of hard to pin down and sure, a lot of it is convenient and makes sense from the 'viewpoint of a game' but it's still kind of iffy how you never have trouble finding wares to sell off in other systems, or nice, paying passengers that won't mind even if you take a detour here or there, missions for a lone hauler with no-one to protect their freight and so on. (I'd say there's lots of room for additional writing and game design here, maybe a 'hardcore mode' of sorts too if some of the features prove too harsh for the casual player.)\n\n- This one is probably the hardest one to explain, but in writer's terms it goes like: 'Does your story tell about the most interesting time of your protagonist's life and if not, why?' At the era presented in the game, a lot of space is already discovered, and although space pirates still roam about, the age of corporate warfare has largely passed, and overall, space is a lot more of a peaceful and prosperous of a place that what it used to be. Sure, it makes for an easier livelihood if you're a lawful merchant, but let's say for an example, wouldn't it have been more interesting to be a pilot at the time of discovery or a smuggler at the 'end times', scraping against the law and corporations to make meets end in a rat race for scarsening resources... (Okay, not that I should try and pretend being a sci-fi writer or anything, but just saying that additional eras to play in could also be a nice addition. Or an easily accessible 'lore/map editor' perhaps? My bad if there already is one... Yup, there already is one. Maybe I'll have to get writing and see what I can do about that 'end times' era.)","November 4, 2015","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Doesn't seem to have much magic about it...but there's a very good chance that that's just me not being 12, like I was when the EV series was in its prime.\n\nAs a grownup, it's okay. Pushes the nostalgia buttons a little bit. It's free, so I can't really complain. Give it a shot, you might like it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Krynnymuffin/recommended/404410/","Krynnymuffin","Krynnymuffin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Krynnymuffin/","126 products in account","This game is free. This game does not seem like a free game now that I've played a bit. I would totally spend money on it. BUT I DON'T HAVE TO! The fact that this is only a beta version just makes me even more excited for what's to come.\n\nNot to mention, the game is Open Source and allows for anybody to add new ships, weapons, missions or planets without even needing the source! Just check the description, there are links and stuff. I haven't clicked them yet, cuz I have my own projects to worry about, but you have a go at it.\n\nDespite the way the economy works, as it is fixed for each planet, I found myself enjoying trading a lot more than other rpg's I've played, and, for once, the game didn't force me to carry an entire arsenal of weapons to avoid having a bad experience. I found this game extremely immersive, which is great inspiration for a sci-fi story, or something, if you're interested in writing.\n\nHowever, one thing I cannot forgive this game for is it's writing. I mean, not in the whole game, mostly just one part in particular. Not even mostly, it's exactly just one part in particular. It's not necessarily a bad thing, nor did it ruin the game for me, it's just something I'm cherry picking because it really annoyed me at the time. SPOILERS IN THE NEXT BIT.\n\nAt one point in the game, as you enter space ports in the Free Worlds region in order to activate an event that starts the Free Worlds storyline, a woman approches you from behind and points a gun at your head and says, "Think fast, Captain." You have a choice to ask her what she wants or defend yourself, with some move you saw in a movie no less. If you defend yourself, you kick the gun out of her hand and harmlessly slap her shoulder, pretty much. She responds by saying "I'd hoped for something better from you. First of all, if this gun were loaded, your brains would be splattered all over the sidewalk. And second, you fight like a girl. I have no use for hotheads like you." You can only respond with "well you ARE a girl!" or you can let her go.\n\nFirst of all, 'first of all' is not a good thing for this character to say. It just seems like a child explain something they believe everyone should know, even though there was no way the other person could know it. She behaves as though she's expecting me to know the kind of person she is, despite it being the first time I've ever seen her.\n\nSecond, the rebel woman looking to recruit you to help fight off a government doesn't want you to defend yourself when someone points a gun at your head. What? If I was trying to overthrow an unfair government, I'd most certainly want the hot headed-est, self-defending-est, badasses in the galaxy on my side, especially since treason is a death-warrenting crime. Sure, I'd want people who can keep calm under stress, but I cannot expect people to keep completely calm when a gun is pointed at their head and they are instructed to 'think fast.' 'Think fast' normally means something bad is gonna happen if you don't. Unless you know the person at the other end of the gun well enough to believe it means otherwise, like this stranger woman seems to believe you do, then you're gonna defend yourself.\n\nAnd thirdly, you have no chance to despute her claim. My very first thought after reading her response to my actions was, "I'm not going to trust a stranger's words with my life," and I really, genuinely suspected there to be a third option besides "Well you are a girl" and let her go. A second chance of redeeming myself in her eyes by demonstrating both my will to live and my ability to reason, but nope. If you defend yourself, you don't get to help the Free Worlds defend themselves.\n\nWTF KINDA ♥♥♥♥ IS THAT?!\n\nReally, it's just one line of dialogue that I'm annoyed about. One line of dialogue that think I can change at my leisure. I pretty much pick apart a sentence in four paragraphs up there. I've been told I have problems. It just really annoyed me. And, actually, it's not even a game breaking thing.\n\nIf you fail this event and use the fake movie karate and get that total BS, there are other events that start the Free Worlds storyline, so no worries.\n\nSo, yeah. It's really just me being picky, which I shouldn't be because the game if free, awesome, and pretty much fully editable.\n\nThis game is still so very great. I love it.","November 22, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ok well fine.\n\nPros:\n\nShip Customization: There is a fairly large variety of ships, all of which have thier own purposes, pro's and cons. I havn't played around with all of them yet, but its pretty apparent after a few hours that there is no single ship that does it all the best, there will always be another ship that does something better then your current ship, weather thats hauling freight, or blowing stuff up, or carrying passengers.\n\nEquipment Customization: Each ship is customizable as far as the type of engines, weapons, and sub systems your ship has. There is great fun to be had trying to optimize your ship while maintaining a functional balance... or you can just say screw balance and desighn a way way overpowered ship in one class, that sucks in everything else.\n\nMissions: All the various missions in the game are tailored to your ship/fleet. This is great starting out, as you wont have "kill/escort" missions dropping on your head that honestly your lil tiny freighter has no hope of completeing. Have a bunch of freighters/transports? You'll get alot of those missions. Have a fleet of fighters? Get combat missions.\n\nCombat: Combat is tough, and fairly hectic, but very enjoyable to watch/participate in. There can be massive fleet engagements, or slow duel's and dances.\n\nFreedom: You can pretty much play how you want, though some ways are easier then others. Can even conquer planets if you desire, though the owning faction will be fairly upset with ou.\n\nCons:\nStill in development: The Game has a few rough points, and can be a bit stale occasionally. Hopefully this will get ironed out, even if it doesnt, heck, its free. I'd have easily dropped 5-10 bucks for this as is.\n\nCombat: Remember how i said combat could be hectic? Well it can also be unfair, and its not very skill based. It usually comes down to who brought the most guns and the variety of guns involved. There is some ways to out skill combat, but usually it comes down to luck, and sheer fire power.\n\nStory: It is pretty lacking as of right now, but the developer is working on this.\n\nEquipment: Although equipment is there, there are few flat "upgrades" So there is little room for improvement of a ship once you have achieved the desire equipment setup. Most upgrades come from getting a different/better ship at this point. And once you have top tier everything, any sense of progression pretty much stagnates.\n\nNo risk: This is more of a personal preference/grey area then an actual con. The game auto saves often, so its very easy to go back to a previous save if things go south. Of course you could not reload, but I personally have a hard time ignoring the temptation, even though i wont a more perma death/risk like game.","November 23, 2015","true","159.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a good amount of side quests for bounty hunting, escorting, and ferrying as well as trading.\nThe galaxy is pretty decent in size already, but I have high hopes on it growing and seeing more planets and factions.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game is very reminiscent of escape velocity, I noticed it is a lot easier to start of as a barge and make trade runs and buy more barges to increase your cargo. I really enjoyed the autopilot bits for landing and jumping to other systems, the auto firing I really appreciated since I wanted to be like those other ships and not fire every gun at the same time.\n\nWishes:\nFaction specific ships, news, faction specific outfits, bigger galaxy, more factions, a steam workshop, junkyard systems, ship painting planets/stations. follow up quests or notes after helping people out, the ability to join a faction and fight as part of a fleet under a commander/work for corporations, after dominating a planet being able to shell out cash to upgrade infrastructure to add more ships, increase trade, increased population etc...\n\nCannot wait to see the game with more content in the future.","November 23, 2015","true","56.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It didn't DRAW you into the game. I can't stress how refreshing that is.\n\nIn my experience, games that DRAW you into them, are only good for people who don't have things to do in the real world. Even many of the so-called casual games require you not be distracted.\n\nI got through high school on EV, and now that I run private business, have two kids, and very little free time, it's nice to find a game that actually lets you play without costing you in the real world.\n\nIn thirty minutes, I wrote this guide, made 4 million credits on my trade route, fed my daughter, talked to my son about a book he is reading, and cleaned portions of the kitchen. A productive morning. On top of that, if I can focus on the game, a quick switch of ships, and I can "Join the Navy!" and blast some scum.","November 23, 2015","true","37.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Okay 40MB. Wait, how is that possible? Well I expected that to download fast since it is 40MB." First time launching/playing the game: "Wow that booted up fast and it's oddly slient though. Wow, I just signed my name for a loan and now I am in debt it seems and paying off the mortgage for my ship. So this old retired ship captain wants to show me the ropes, sure why not? Okay how the hell do I fly this ship? Okay so that is how I use my warpdrive thing. Oh ♥♥♥♥! Is he shooting at me?! Wait... Why don't I have weapons?! Welp, guess I am stuck here cause he disabled my ship. Wait I can call for help from one of these traveling ships. Oh hey he repaired me. Well I guess that is pretty realistic, buying a ship and NOT having a damn weapon on it. Guess I gotta buy one. Okay I got this tiny laser pointer thing on my shuttle now. Time to go where this old guy wants me to go. Sell any cargo I got? I never got any old man, was I supposed to get some at some point?! Oh great he found a family of people who want a ride to another plan--Wait they want to move to a place called New China? Well I guess if they pay me I guess it will be fine. Damn! That ship is 10x the size my mine, thank god it ain't a pirate. Huh I guess that was easy, just droping people off and them giving me credits for it. Oh, the old guy found more people. Jeez, this map and controls are kinda complicated looking. Wow, I have to pay to land on this planet. Man the Republic are ♥♥♥♥♥. Okay dropped them off and got more money. Oh I have to drop the old guy off at the retirement home he reserved his slot in now, okay. Wait, the planet is one the more luxurious planets? Oh, that old captain is rich? And he only gave me 30,000 credits for going all around the galaxy? Okay, cheapskate. Guess I am out of the tutorial now, better do some of these jobs on the planets and moons. Huh these jobs give me money quick if I can do em fast. Hey, if I sell my old ship and all the stuff I put on it I can get this one with more cargo and passenger space. Man I am starting to get money fast. Holy hell some of these ships cost MILLIONS! Holy ♥♥♥♥! That is alot of pirates and they are destroying everything! So I died okay, I can just reload from when I was last docked. I really wish I picked a cargo ship from the start or I will be making so much more! Okay lesson learned, do NOT get in fights with my shuttle or I will get killed quick. Huh, I am getting close to a million thanks to all these jobs I am doing. Wow, this map is WAY bigger than I thought. Man, I better not get anything illegal in my hold I have been scanned by the Republic so many times. Hmm, if I pay extra on my mortgage I maybe able to pay it off faster, oh cool I pay lower interest now. So the Republic ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off some people and now a civil war is gonna happen, kinda saw that coming. I finally paid off my mortgage! Now I don't have to pay 2000 or 1000 credits each day. Oh hey if I sell my current ship I can buy this ship that is way better in everything than mine. Wow this ship can jump 9 times before have to refuel at a planet. Another section of the map? Good thing I have been local maps went ever I visit a new outfitter, otherwise I may be lost or cofused right now. Man I am starting to make a lot of money. Should upgrade my passenger space so I can transport more people. Rush deliveries make you alot of money if you can do 'em, got it. Oh, I seem to have found the pirate side of the map, ♥♥♥♥. Republic wants to protect us my ♥♥♥, there are alot of pirates everywhere. This part of the map barely have any outfitters, so this will be fun trying to find a path to get there for this job. Holy ♥♥♥♥! I found the where the pirates live! Okay I think I am done for the night. Wait... I played this for four and half hours straight?!

It kinda saddens me that this kind of game concepts are pretty much ignored by the AAA studios and publishers, because I'd love to see a game where I could do all of this in first person. (Star Citizen, maybe?)\nTeh arbitrary list of pros and cons goes here:\n\nPros:\n- An original sci-fi world with its own lore, locales, races, thingmagajigs etc. Lots of descriptions, random events and tiny detail you could admire for hours and hours...\n\n- The game leaves the exploration and discovery to you and there's direct benefits as well as risks to it. I know its hard to achieve with the level of writing shown here, but I kinda wish there was a random map generator and/or more rogue-like elements for additional replay value.\n\n-The learning/grinding curve feels rough and tedious at times, but it's never unfair other than in the way you'd expect it\nto be. (You're a lone, debt-ridden pilot in space, anyone could be your enemy if you decide to make them one...)\n\n-You can be a transporter or a merchant and moreover, it's profitable and compelling enough on its own, you never feel like the story or the gameplay is forcing any of the combat and conflict on you. (This is what practically every other sci-fi -themed, or rather, every other videogame is guilty of...)\n\n-It's not like they forgot about conflict either, sure you can become a space pirate or a bounty hunter, even a scout if you will, but it's way more risky than being a merchant, and rightly so.\n\nCons:\n- Combat is clunky, you feel like inertia is your main enemy, as you and your opponent spin around in awkward circles  briefly barraging each other with your weapons before flying off in separate directions... (Most of of the time is easier to avoid fighting all together, and true enough, transporters and freighters are not even designed for combat, but having it in there, I'd love if it was a bit more accessible to a new player, since I don't feel any sort of motivation to try and learn about combat in its current form.)\n\n- "Everything is ready for you.." This is kind of hard to pin down and sure, a lot of it is convenient and makes sense from the 'viewpoint of a game' but it's still kind of iffy how you never have trouble finding wares to sell off in other systems, or nice, paying passengers that won't mind even if you take a detour here or there, missions for a lone hauler with no-one to protect their freight and so on. (I'd say there's lots of room for additional writing and game design here, maybe a 'hardcore mode' of sorts too if some of the features prove too harsh for the casual player.)\n\n- This one is probably the hardest one to explain, but in writer's terms it goes like: 'Does your story tell about the most interesting time of your protagonist's life and if not, why?' At the era presented in the game, a lot of space is already discovered, and although space pirates still roam about, the age of corporate warfare has largely passed, and overall, space is a lot more of a peaceful and prosperous of a place that what it used to be. Sure, it makes for an easier livelihood if you're a lawful merchant, but let's say for an example, wouldn't it have been more interesting to be a pilot at the time of discovery or a smuggler at the 'end times', scraping against the law and corporations to make meets end in a rat race for scarsening resources... (Okay, not that I should try and pretend being a sci-fi writer or anything, but just saying that additional eras to play in could also be a nice addition. Or an easily accessible 'lore/map editor' perhaps? My bad if there already is one... Yup, there already is one. Maybe I'll have to get writing and see what I can do about that 'end times' era.)","November 4, 2015","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I choose a Freighter as my starting ship, and began running small time delivery missions across the galaxy. No sweat. Eventually i had enough for a better quality freighter. Rackin in some serious cash. Before I realised it, i had my own little merchant fleet of 3 Freighters. Pirates were never really too much of an issue. I was lucky. Until... On a simple escort mission 2 jumps from my location, I was bum rushed by Pirate scumbags. I knew I couldnt fight them off as they were some serious high tech ♥♥♥♥, So I cut my losses and left my second ship, The "Deliverance" to be taken by the Pirates. God bless the crew. Upon turning in the mission, turns out the Pirates had tagged along into an empty sector of space where only me and my last remaining Freighter floated harmlessly. We didnt even bring down a single pirate ship before I heard the lovely sound of my ships interior exploding outwards into the void of Pirate infested space.\n\nRIP Merchant ships, Deliverance, Oppertunity, and Void Runner. You shall be missed.\n\nReally though. The game is addictive, and free. No pesky microtransactions. The gameplay itself is somewhat confusing at first but youll get the hang of it in time. The pirates are unforgiving and at times ridiculously frustrating, as you can be stuck reloading your save trying to escape a system where they can wipe you, and your escorts out in moments.\n\nAside from this, the detail in the game is great. alot of story elements erry'where. Its a good time.\n\nTL;DR\n\nFun game with graphics a toaster connected to a gameboy color could run, With detailed information on planets and factions. Just beware of the ♥♥♥♥ING PIRATES.\nAnd no ingame microtransactions, so you dont need your wallet.\nVery small download size for those like me who have unreliable snail-speed, or an internet limit.\n\nDownload it.

This game is a 2D sci-fi game where you start off buying your first ship (after taking a sizeable loan just over 420k) you meet people in spaceports that give you quests you can choose your career of a trader,cruise ship captain,bounty hunter, freedom fighter, pirate, the list goes on. It's really dependant on your style of play. I opted to be a frieghter captain contracting my services for stable income and occasionally disabling small pirate craft and taking all their equipment. After awhile you pay off your loan and really your story depends on where you head off too. Shortly after my first mission I took a contract that took my south of the starting area and as i delivered my cargo i checked the spaceport and ended up being recruited by some of the free fighters to observe some systems. I further assisted them recieving a nice profit for good work nothing too bad just a smuggling of a person here and there. Overall the missions you get are well written in my opinion as well as some of your responces (I did the karate move for kicks fyi). The ship and module variaty seemed quite low at first untill i realized duh your not gonna have a planet selling every ship variaty. I started exploring and bam many new ships and modules were discovered. However the UI for the modules could use a little more clarity ( thought i might sell my ship by selling a module at first) but after about 15-30 minutes you get the hang of it. So for a free game 10/10 there is no downside to downloading this game since it's so small. If i had to pay for this game i might pause since the combat seems a little harsh some times (but hey i was a freighter not a fighter so i cant judge to harshly) still if they asked under 5$ it would still be reasonable the universe is quiet well crafted.

It has scratched that EV itch and then some.  It's a great game and I hope that the Dev continues to expand on it.","November 1, 2015","true","23.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's an exploration/trading/ship shooting game. Not too hard to make money and not too horribly grindy. Fairly easy to use controls and graphics are decent for 2D (top-view).","November 1, 2015","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
