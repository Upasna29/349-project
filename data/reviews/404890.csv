Hell, even Battleship Surface Thunder is infinitely better than this game and it's a mediocre game from 2000...FROM A CEREAL BOX.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/i70D4pVC♥♥♥\n\nTechnicals:\nOptions- Virtually none. there is no options menu in the game and the only place you will be able to find an option to use is while you are in a mission and that is the option to disable sound.\n\nPerformance: The thing runs at 1000fps according to my computer which it better considering the low graphics but even then the main menu still manages to produce screen tear when you are scrolling through the mission thumbnails.\n\nGraphics/appearance:\nA mixed bag of bad. The game runs in 4:3 inside of a square frame hud thing which doesn't even properly fit the screen, The map is ridiculously low resolution (Imagine if you were playing an early 2000s videogame and zoomed in all the way to stare at the ground) and isn't even well designed it looks as if land masses were just shoved all over to make it look fuller but it just looks horrendous.\n\nThe units have a completely different aesthetic to them, the map (despite the low res) is a kind of "realistic" texture meanwhile the units have a mixed bag of drawn textures or just flat colours and some of the models just look terrible like the boat you start in.\n\nThe one cool thing I will say is that when your boat takes enough damage the hud gets damaged and your fuel guage falls right off which is pretty amusing.\n\nSound: You start off with some rather satisfying music at the main menu but the instant you enter a mission the music stops...there is no in-game music. The only audio you will hear for 90% of the time is the sound of the submarine's engine (which sounds more like a muffled jetski than anything) with a bit of sounds from combat.\n\nGameplay: The submarines control horribly and unrealistically. Turning while moving is the most sluggish thing ever but when I stop holding the forward key I can turn do a 180 almost instantly. When you aren't submerged you can hold shift to spring...yes sprint, because that's a thing boats do.\nAnyway, holding shift makes your boat move at a ridiculous pace, you are just speeding across the map like no tomorrow despite even your normal movement speed being more than twice as fast as battleships.\n\nUnits make no sense, I can go up to a battleship and stare it down for 10 seconds while my single deck gun autofires at it and I will win despite not using any torpedoes and the battleship being twice my size and having twice as many guns which should be stronger as well. On the other end of ridiculous a biplane (which is larger than the starting sub which I'm pretty sure isn't accurate but I'm no expert)  flying by overhead can unleash a torrent of bullets at me and sink me in aboujt 2 seconds flat.\n\nThere isn't even a point to being a submarine, you travel 10x faster unsubmerged and enemies can spot you while you are submerged anyway, the only thing that makes it feel like you're diving is that enemies can't use gun-based weapons on you but battleships can throw these massive watermines at you while you are submerged so wth? You can dive even deeper but that disables your weapons and makes you move so slow you may as well not be moving.\n\nThe game is literally kill boats instantly with your op weapons and dive when you see a plane.\n\nThere is no consequence to dying, you just respawn and they tell you how many times you've died and try not to die anymore,\n\nConclusions: Bad bad game, Go buy sid meiers piraes instead when it's on sale.","January 7","false","0.9"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","1"

In other words, you'll need to use the KB to not just move the sub around, but to also navigate the menus. At one point my sub even started spinning by itself and wouldn't stop until I quit and restarted the game.\n\nThe imagery in this game is a fuzzy, pixelated mess. For the price, I didn't expect AAA graphics. but the visuals are worse than Flash games I played over 15 years ago. To make matters worse, almost all the images (including the text) look like the developer took GIFs and stuck them into the game while haphazardly resizing them.\n\nStay away from this game unless you're okay with paying for something that looks like a kid dabbled with Macromedia Director and slapped together a mess. I'm going to request a refund. Sure, the game is cheap, but I don't want to give ANY support to a developer who'd release this scam.","January 7","false","0.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Super buggy, first 20 minutes was spent wondering why my ship was constantly rotating in circles until I finnaly reset the game to fix it. Some odd quirks too it but it's decent I guess. Much better games out there for the same or better prices.\nps. Game also seems to be stuck in a low resolution (so black bars a plenty) and the loading screens are even worse.\npss. no mouse support","January 7","false","0.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Unfortunately you lose control of steering for the most part when you do this.\n\nCons:\nLooks like it was made in the 80s.  Not in a good nostalgic way..\nNo mouse support..\nNo options menu..\nGameplay.. meh?\n\nGameplay/review video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9mPTaQzPgE\n\nAnd that's all I have to say about that.","January 9","false","0.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"
