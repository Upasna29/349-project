Pure RPGs, which thrive on story at the expense of almost all else, are not among them. While the combat gameplay is passable, the writing is beyond bad, heaping contrivance upon awkward shoe-in on top of nigh-endless obsequeious player-praising that would make an Elder Scrolls writer blush. Everyone is a dramatic charicature of a person, /everyone/. This is not the grand arena, you are not the chosen one, there is no evil empire, and this game most definitely does not smell like incense.

I enjoyed it, but I also was increasingly frustrated by it.\n\nIt's an older-style RPG, like another of their games, Loren, but with a bit of the mindless dungeon-crawler aspect. As much as I enjoy dungeon-crawlers, this game managed to drag through some of them. You're supposed to search through the desert to "find" specific items needed to continue with the plot, but your searches can turn up random items or monsters, which you can flee (when possible), or fight.\n\nSometimes, however, the battles seemed overpowered, and there isn't as much that grinding to help. You get most of your items from the supply room on the ship, so you don't get to fight and earn money to purchase your own supplies. Most of the higher items come as you fight and raise up, which I found more difficult to do than in their other games.\n\nWhile this game does have its otome/visual novel elements, they do take a large back-seat to the game. It doesn't have as large of a choice pool for potential partners, if that's your cup of tea, and I found the scenes to be more amusing (if often shorter) in Loren than I did in PS.\n\nThat said, I enjoyed the game more or less, but I don't believe I'll be replaying it, and I'm glad I got it for 50% off. I'd recommend it, I suppose, if you enjoy old-style RPGs, and have some time to kill, but otherwise, it's probably not for you.","June 21, 2014","false","2.0"," 42 of 52 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","42","52","3","0"

This did take a lot of time though.\n\nThe story seems to be OK, but filled with a bit too many stock plot "twists" to be really interesting. For a cheapish game, I can live with it. Dialogs are simple and rather... dull. You are presented with a block of text, follwed by another block of text and so on. Once the talking is done, you're presented with a few options (which you can repeat untill you hit the magic "stop talking" button). So far, I've found very few real dialog options.\n\nDialog does affect relationships from time to time, but just like too many other "RPGs" you often have no idea what the effects will be; when allowing my party to drink while gathering information, my relations with the super soldier party's alcohols is reduced.\n\nThe combat is typical for it's genre -- your party goes in order and get a few options to attack the enemy. The enemy then goes in order in the same style, untill either side is defeated. XP appears to rewarded on a kill basis -- when a party member finishes an enemy that person gets all the XP from the enemy.\n\nCombat difficulty appears to scale much faster than your characters do. So far, I've gotten 1 level on my main character (by manageing damage so he could get more kills). In the meantime the enemies have gone from doing about 5 damage per attack to about 20 damage per attack and hit points have gone from 40ish to 300ish.\n\nIf you want to have level your main character fast, go for scout -- accuracy is the most important thing when dealing damage and scouts, at equal skill level, will be significantly better at hitting enemies, while doing roughly equal damage (that is, more damage) than soldiers or guardians.\n\nOn top of the poor combat and the bad writing, the game's performance is appauling. On a 2.8 GHz CPU the UI is sluggish, animations choppy and picking dialog options have delays. Combat is equally slow. The only part of the game which does not have extremly bad perfomance is text rendering, which is a big help, since you'll be skipping most of it anyway.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this game. The balance of the game is really poor and the story simply doesn't make up for the rubbish combat.","October 9, 2014","false","8.8"," 44 of 60 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","44","60","4","2"

I liked "Loren" a lot (except there was a ton of purple prose when it came to the in-game romances and a few of the romances felt creepy/abusive) for the mixture of story and very oldschool game mechanics.\n\nThe difference between "Loren" and "Planet Stronghold" is pretty much they emphasized different things.  "Loren" developed the relationships and romances to a huge degree - the romances didn't just happen, the player had to seek them out, but had minimal game mechanics.... "Planet Stronghold" has minimal romances and an implausible story (put the cadet in charge of a war because he has a familiar last name?) and really good (though oldschool) game mechanics.\n\nThe aggro system in "Planet Stronghold" is AWESOME.  You can instantly tell which one of your group is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the mobs the most by glancing down at their meter, and comparing it to the other group members.  Best system for aggro control I've ever played, in any game.\n\nThis is a solid game to play if you're bored and if it's on sale.

Basically, they fall into 3 categories: combat skills, non-combat skills, and psionic (magic) skills. Most of the combat skills are divided into weapon skills, of which you should only put levels into one of them, which is based on your class selection. Every 20 points in a weapon skill, it raises damage with that weapon type by 1 per shot. This means that weapons that get 4 shots in one round get 4x more improvement than weapons with 1 shot - this is silly. The other combat skills: armor, accuracy, and evasion actually all do work alright, and are tempting to level even when they're not a class specific skill. Leveling individual psionics skills is absolutely broken, however. There is a singular root psionics skill which improves ALL the subskills in such a way that leveling individual skills is completely pointless. The non-combat skills are 'okay'. All they do is influence the RNG in various plot events that occur throughout the story, and a few give some mild combat perks.\n(-) Psionics is not a very well balanced skill set. The one class that is dedicated to the use of it, it works pretty well, and a majority of the spells will see some use from it. Unfortunately, the 3 other classes in the game, while they're meant to have varying aptitudes with psionics, they're effectively bad enough with it that just attacking is the right answer.\n(-) The inventory/equipment UI could be a lot better. It's a non-trivial matter (when it ought to be) of comparing the values of weapons.\n(-) The characters are pretty shallow, although I'm mostly giving this one a pass due to the nature of the game.\n\n(+/-) There isn't just attacking. There's 3 different attack types which have varying levels of shots fired per round, hit %, crit chance, and aggro drawn. The first 3 of those parameters are pretty boring - with some time spent with calculations, you can find out which attack type gives you the most damage for the weapon you're using. However, the level of aggro drawn is an interesting mechanic that I'll cover later.\n(+/-) Lots of RNG. Can lead to some frustration, can also lead to some exciting down to the line fights.\n\n(+) While it's nothing too special, I did like the flow of the plot and the setting. Based on other users' negative reviews, I guess your mileage may very significantly here.\n(+) Games often have to sacrifice in order to provide a gamepath that isn't on tracks.\n(++) Aggro management. Different actions will raise the probability that the enemy will target that particular character on their turn (and thus lower the probability of attacking the other 3 characters). This mechanic right here is significantly responsible for tactical decisions, and despite all the other flaws of the game, actually leaves combat kinda fun. It's an intricate balance between shaping as much aggro on your characters with the best resistances to the enemy attacks, but also still spreading enough damage to other characters, since even your characters with the best resistances can get overwhelmed by 2 consecutive rounds of the enemy focusing on him. Enemy will have enough mana to use an ability that will block a character from using normal attacks for a couple turns? Better ramp up the aggro on your Psionic.\n\nIn summary, I believe a broken leveling system (and its subsequent damage on the magic system) has wrecked an otherwise mediocre title that would earn a $10-15 pricetag.","November 28, 2014","false","5.0"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","17","20","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/recommended/291050/","abedsbrother","AbedsBrother","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/","525 products in account","A choice-laden narrative and attractive soundtrack are minor positives for a game let down by an immature story, horrible dialogue, and boring, badly implemented / balanced combat. Avoid unless frustration is your preferred form of masochism.\n\nFirst the choices. There are a lot of choices, and they do branch convincingly: if you wanted to romance a certain character and screw it up, there's no way to charm yourself back into their good graces. Find a save, and re-load. The choices aren't just about romancing: every single member of your party has dialogues and side missions that will unlock if you talk to them enough and make the right dialog choices. Even faction alliances are contained within mutually exclusive dialog choices. Full marks for a branching narrative.\n\nThe choices and consequences are real enough, but don't buy Planet Stronghold expecting mature levels of writing. The story verges on the ridiculous – a recruit with all of 2 days of experience is put in charge of an army. I'm all for playing pretend and enjoying impossible accomplishments, but come on. It's not like in Dragon Age Origins, for instance, where Alistair cedes command of the party to you; that was explained within the story as part of the character arc. Here, you get a command because the prince you've known for a few hours suddenly “trusts you.” Some of the dialogue is worse than what you would find in a B-movie. And there's no voice-acting to make the lines sound better than they are. They're just there, and if you as a player can't commit to the characters and the story, you'll be absolutely p*ssed about how the dialogue sounds in your head.\n\nYou'll see other reviews proclaiming the challenging combat as a great addition to a story-driven game. Yeah, no. Combat is awful. It takes the relaxing visual-novel experience and forces story progression through hours of meaningless and boring combat. Fire guns, use Psionics to buff the hero and his team, let the bad guys fire back, repeat until the enemies fall. When weapons are dealing 5 points of damage per shot (even after de-buffing the target), and an enemy has 350 points of health, that's a lot of sitting still and clicking, waiting for the fight to be over.\n\nWhat makes matters worse is that the combat itself is badly balanced (if the word balanced can even be used here). Here's an example. If my character has an 80% accuracy rating, there is no way (mathematically) he should miss 3 shots out of every 5. At most, he should miss 1 out of 5, or 2 out of 10, or 3 out of 15. But when his burst of fire is 7 shots, and he misses 5 of them, something is badly wrong. “You need to level your Accuracy skill and take into account the enemy's Evade skill” (I did) “and don't use the Burst setting!” (I didn't). I even reduced the difficulty to Easy to see if it would make a difference. It doesn't. The only conclusion I can draw is that the results of the turn-based combat are entirely random. Not a good thing to hang onto your choice-laden visual novel. Not saying the IDEA of having turn-based combat in a visual novel is bad – it isn't – but don't make it randomized, then boast your game is “challenging.”\n\nI generally start a game wanting to like it. Planet Stronghold was no different. After 20 hours and multiple attempts at progressing, I'm giving up and am off to play something else.","October 16, 2015","false","20.1"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","17","21","4","0"

It seems like there is a dynamic skill and character development at your first glance but it quickly wears off as you can save at literally any time during both conversations and battle. This means you cans save for random dice roll percentile skill checks (given like 22% chance of success) and you can bump each party member in 1 skill and since you have your entire huge party available for most tasks you always succed. Talking to your party hurts me physically as most of the other party members (soldiers) in the game have high school kid conversations. I ended up nearly maxxing charisma to only use it two or three times the entire game.  The game appears and plays to be a high class flash game from a website not so much a game worth $20.\n\nI am a big fan of games like Planescape Torment, Fallout, Shadowrun and Age of Decadence so story really matters to me, and with a game which has combat in which you can just click through you need meaningful conversations to happen.\n\nThe weak dialogue and character interactions really disappoint because the plot was quite interesting albeit extremely short but the immersion is too easily broken with your character stammering and getting embarrassed like a kid about to have sex for the first time all the while everyone praising your magnificent efforts.\n\nWorse part is I'm likely gonna finish the game just so my character can get laid by sexy female character with the last name "Fox". Also the females have a permanent blush tone to their face and with the character writing it seems like a dating simulator with RPG combat elements to advance the storyline.\n\n5.5/10 on completion.","June 3, 2014","false","8.4"," 29 of 44 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","29","44","0","2"

It seemed good at first, but the more I played, the more mind numbing, tedious and boring it became. I thought it was going to be good because it added a social element to a typical RPG. However, this game is nowhere near as good as the likes of Persona or Fire Emblem: Awakening. The social aspect is limited to making simple choices between two options which either impress or irritate the other characters in the game. Additionally, a lot of the choices look as though you're going to irritate the person you're talking to either way, which I personally don't like.\n\nYet, this isn't the only problem I found with the game. The equipment you have is fairly simple and there are only two ways to obtain more. Recycle your old gear for scrap metal and build new equipment with it or find it on quests. To find new equipment on quests is not efficient as you have several crew members who all need their own equipment and the quests yield nowhere near the amount needed. As for the recycling method, the amount of scrap metal needed is far too great (from my experience).\n\nFinally, I find the combat to be very repetitive. A lot of the enemies are extremely powerful and take a lot of effort to take down. This results in you needing to go through long battles on a regular basis doing the exact same moves and praying luck is in your favour, since you really need a lot of luck in this game. It wouldn't be so bad if there were ways to grind against some weaker enemies, but as of yet, I have not found a single place where I can grind against waves of weaker enemies to train my team up.\n\nAll in all, it's not enjoyable for me. Especially since I feel the need to rest to restore my HP/PP at the end of every single battle. It makes me feel cheap for doing so but I know that if I don't, I'll end up dying in the next one. If you do decide to play this game, I have only one bit of advice for you. Save often. The autosave feature is buggy. I know I've lost some good progress just because the autosave deleted my save files out of nowhere.","September 24, 2014","false","6.7"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","14","18","2","0"

Now that I've finished this game once, I can say that its value lies mostly in being a curiosity, an example of what is possible in Ren'Py.\n\nUnfortunately, whether I look at it as a visual novel with RPG combat or as an RPG with visual novel storytelling, as a game Planet Stronghold falls short.\n\nThe RPG part alternates between dull and irritating. The battles themselves fall into predictable patterns. I've seen the threat mechanic before in other indie RPGs, so it wasn't particularly impressive to me.\n\nEvaluating equipment is a hassle at first because the specs of the weapons and armor are presented in a horizontal line, which makes the numbers more difficult to decipher. And comparing equipment is even more unintuitive because the UI uses green or red numbers to indicate whether the specs of the item you currently have are better or worse than the new item you're considering--the exact opposite of what RPG interfaces normally use such numbers for.\n\nIn my playthrough, armor appeared frequently as a quest reward, which seemed like a great idea until I realized that I hadn't been spending skill points on armor for many of my party members, and a lot of these pieces demanded high skill levels. My fault for not anticipating, I admit, but I would have liked different grades of armor for different classes so that these quest rewards wouldn't feel so useless.\n\nAs for the visual novel part, the student-level writing fails to carry the contrivance-laden and flimsy plot. I wish I had a nickel every time someone expressed surprise or anger with "What?!" or stammered in discomfort, or declared success with "We made it!" The characters experience little development. The romance path I tried didn't seem like a natural progression of affection and chemistry between two people; it was just kind of there all of a sudden, and right after the big kiss scene, it was gone even more abruptly.\n\nIn the end, this game was a disappointment. I would have happily tolerated the middling RPG experience if the visual novel writing and choices had been compelling. As it stands, Planet Stronghold is worth playing only as something to learn from. I'm looking forward to playing Loren The Amazon Princess to see how it improves on the RPG-VN formula.","January 24","false","17.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Occasionally, I enjoy a good RPG as long as it has a decent storyline which will keep me engaged for hours.  As there is a basic summary of what the game is about on the store page, I won't bother to resummarize it.  Rather, I'll say what I liked and what I felt could be improved upon.\n\nFirst, I like that you can choose whether to play as a female or a male.  Not all RPGs offer that as a main playable character so this is nice.  Also, I like how you can choose among four different classes: soldier, scout, guardian, or psionic (basically, the sci-fi equivalent of a magic user).  I had the chance to play all four classes and it was interesting to note each one's strengths and weaknesses.  Also, I like how there are a total of 6 romance subplots you can play and how some of them will require certain quests to be done.  However, the romance is totally optional so you can play this game without having to complete any romance subplot.  In addition, I like how completing certain quests can earn you better weapons or armor and there is a nice variety of both items available.\n\nNow as to weaknesses...First off, I thought that the RPG aspect itself was slow at times.  I found myself having to click to quickly get through a battle.  Speeding this up would have been a good idea (assuming that's possible, of course).  As to the writing itself, I felt that it was decent although some parts felt a little cheesy at times especially with regards to the romantic scenes.  If you're looking for more originality, this game doesn't offer much in that area.  Personally, I don't mind a little cheesiness as long as it's not overdone.  Finally, I found some minor grammar errors despite that the game was proofread.  A little further proofreading would certainly help.\n\nOverall, though, I enjoyed it very much and spent a lot of hours on Planet Stronghold so I suppose I thought it was worth it.  I'm eager to give Loren a try now and compare the two games when I have the chance.  ^^","July 25, 2015","true","55.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Planet Stronghold is a mix between RPG and Visual Novel. It's RPG mechanics are okay, and it's storyline can grab your attention quite quickly in this game if your the type to prefer story over gameplay.\n\nThe RPG mechanics are fairly basic. As you go through the game, new gear will be offered for free basically at the Armory, and that's where you upgrade your equipment. You can find a lot of better stuff by exploring the world and researching it(also basic), but the Armory stuff is enough to get you by.\n\nIt's not just "read story" and "battle enemies". There's other skills you can level such as charisma, survival, explosives, repair, science, sneak, and some others. These do not have too much use outside of combat, except for a few, but there are various events that happen, as well as side quests, that these skills can be used to change events, whether it be weakening an enemy, completing the objective/goal without fighting, getting new items, or other interesting things, theses skills are used to change how the encounter plays out. There 8 characters that you have traveling with you, and while you can only have 4 max in combat, and sometimes a character isn't with you due to story, but these characters level alongside you, and you can just have each character invest in 1, or preferably 2 of these "event" skills, and you'll rarely have trouble passing these skill checks. I still found them a great way to spice up various encounters.\n\nCombat itself is standard RPG affair. One thing to notice is that every weapon does a type of damage, and that every enemy has different resistances to the damage types. It's very important to carry at least one of each damage type, and that every character should have at least 2 weapons with separate damage types, else they can be rendered useless outside of healing since they won't be able to do much damage against the enemy. However, they game gives you basic equipment to counter the enemies, since this is still a story driven game and doesn't want the player stuck on enemies, so there's no reason you should end up unprepared for a fight, other than your own negligence.\n\nThe story itself is okay. It won't win any awards in my opinion, but it's a good story.\nConclusion: The price point for this game is very high in my opinion(I got it in a bundle). While I think it's a good game, I wouldn't say it's worth $20. Unless your a very big fan of visual novels, I'd recommend waiting until a large sale. If I recall correctly, this game is free on android, though the Deluxe edition has extras. Try that if you can. There's also a free demo on their site.\n","May 5, 2014","true","2.3"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","9","19","0","0"

Great story, interesting development. Still wish Lafleur was bi. Nonetheless wonderful game, you buy it, you'll be playing it for a bit. Feels great for a Vn with Rpg aspects similiar to science girls, sunrider, and a few other VNs and Rpgs you've seen here. This piece of work goes in quite the depth similiar to Loren the Amazon Princess. Still very great.  Rating 9/10. Reason is I just kind of hate the inventory gui. It sets the new guys who haven't played something like this off, no sorting order, has to be manual, also comparison are confusing if they don't know how to identify them. Can't tell you how many times I was looking at a weapon to double check it's stats and my armor too. I didn't want to die out there.

You could certainly play through more than once to unlock different options; there are different paths you can take according to decisions you make.

Several romance options even a gay and lesbian option. Story isn't very interesting. The enemies have no personality and arent interesting. Supporting characters have their own stories that are very short and are a way for you to get some new armor or weapon. Battles are interesting the first time but quickly get repetitive and you will be clicking your mouse a lot to get faster through them (set all weapons to burst unless you miss a lot). Also its hard to navigate the menu because you can't access  every menu from any point of the game. To access quests or skills overview you need to be in dialog window. Can't access it from the planet (world) map. I'm saying that cause you sometimes need to know who has the most points in a certain skill. Anyway, not a completely bad game, but you will want to play it only if you are a visual novel lover.

You get 2 straight options and 1 gay option for romance and that's it, Loren had like 10 times as many options.  It is however one of their older games, so I guess it shouldn't be as good gameplay or story wise.  It has the same general plot, gather allies~ defeat greater eviL~ which isn't bad for a story game, I just felt like it wasn't presented as nicely as it was in Loren the Amazon Princess.  Combat is challenging, but I also think there isn't enough equipment options.\n\nThough this is the company that mades Loren the Amazon Princess, my favorite RPG of all time, I gotta say I don't feel the same way about this title in the slightest.  I wish they streamlined it a bit and touched up the story for the Steam Release of the title to at least try and put it near the same level as Loren.\n\nI can't say I woulds recommend this one to somone new to Visual Novel RPGs.  It is fun, just not as fun as Loren.\n\nMy personal complaints about the game are... I wish the storytelling grabbed you emotionally like Loren did.  This one just had some sort of strange disconnect feeling.  I also disliked the restrictive romance options... a LOT, I couldn't romance the person I wanted to ingame.\n\nThough I have a lot of complaints, I will not thumbs down on a Recommendation, mostly due to the fact I may have a biased view on this title as I played Loren the Amazon Princess first, which is one of their newer games.  It felt like it's just a bit dated in comparison.","July 20, 2014","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
