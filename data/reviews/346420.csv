Been playing The Spatials for many months prior to the Steam launch (stoked that my save games transferred seamlessly).\n\nAs a DF9 refugee I have to say I'm loving The Spatials. It's not the same game DF9 was trying to be so don't think it's an exact replica. Main differences being the art style, you cannot explore directly outside your base (but you can perform away missions on planet) and most of all this game is actually complete!\n\nThe Spatials has more depth than you might initially think from a cursory glance. It's never a hard game but there is a bit of thinking and a bit of managment required. Mostly when it comes to leveling up your crew members so they can a.) fight tougher enemies in the away missions and b.) man the higher level embassies to speed up your resource production.\n\nEquiping your mission team with a suprisingly large number of different abilities and special weapons is a fun and interesting dimension. I'm still finding new abilities (or new levels of power) that I didn't realise existed. Abilities are picked up as semi-random drops from completing missions.\n\nInitially you may think money is your big hurdle but once you get a good tourist trade running (with the requisite food, drinks, merchanidise, beds and showers production lines running) money will not be an issue. Leveling your crew and opening up the tech tree will be.\n\nYes there is a (somewhat linear) tech tree which will gradually open up new rooms and items to start new production lines.\n\nHave to also mention the two man team at Weird & Wry. Carlos is amazingly responsive to queries and feedback on the official Spatials forums and I couldn't fault the open communication, frank feedback and friendly rapport he has built with the community there. A note that The Spatials is released as a complete game and not Early Access. As such there is no feature roadmap to build out that I'm aware of. I don't mind, as the game is pretty darn good right now.\n\nAs I mentioned I've been playing for several months now (since Dec 2014) and haven't become bored (although some of the away missions do tend to repeat with increased difficulty). So for less money down than that other space base building, management game, The Spatials has more depth, missions, simple combat, a tech tree, deep chracter skills and abilities, a story line and fantastic devs.\n\nHighly recommend for the price.\n\nFinno\n\n","March 31, 2015","true","14.8"," 54 of 59 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","54","59","2","0"

It has a really polished UI. At the beginning the game seems interesting and even though the tutorials don't teach you everything but leave a bit to discover (like removing items when your inventory gets full) it's quite easy to get.\n\nUnfortunately that simplicity also is the root of the problem with the game. It's just too simple. There's no much strategy involved - you just need to build everything your visitors require. The game doesn't allow you to do much planning or optimization. Soon you also start to run out of resources, which can be helped with the away team and "diplomacy". Unfortunately there are also some weird requirements for materials you just don't have or will have in long time (like fibers). The campaign starts to feel one long linear path you're unlocking.\n\nSpeaking of the away teams and exploration mode. It's interesting, challening and funny at first, but becomes mundane quite soon. All the missions are basically variations of three architypes: find items, kill pirates, destroy buildings. After dozen of levels, you feel you've seen it all.\n\nThe difficulty levels in exploration is quite uneven. At first the missions are extremely easy (12 first planets or so), but the you hit a huge wall where completing a level becomes a true (much needed) challenge . Unfortunately the game still repeats the same pattern, and with no chance of strategy throw in, it becomes boring. The difficulty comes from the fact that enemies have more health and they do more damage. They always behave the same: go to the attack range and attack. No specific AI or anything. I was able to complete WTF difficulty boss just by running around in the room and sniping him in the head.\n\nThe game feels like a casual mobile game. Judging from the trello todo list they also wanted to target mobile, so that might explain it.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot recommend the game in it's current form.\n\nSome people have said that this is the game DF-9 was supposed to be, and now after playing the Spatials that certainly isn't a compliment :P\n","April 5, 2015","false","3.7"," 68 of 82 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","68","82","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Buustriker/recommended/346420/","Buustriker","Buustriker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Buustriker/","352 products in account","Honestly i did not expect that much - i was just looking for a small sim, not too expensive.\n\nBut i was really surprised by this game. First of all you get 4 games in one.\n\nSimulation - Manage and build your base, train your crew and make your visitors happy.\n\nStrategy - Decide which missions to do to get the different resources of the different planets.\n\nTactical realtime combat - You play with your 5 man landing crew on the planets to solve mission, fight bosses.\n\nRPG - Decide how to develop your crew, equip them with stuff you find or get in missions. Control what they should do, and what not.\n\nAll these for parts of the game are more or less lite versions of each genre.\n\nThe simulation part makes fun, but it is not so hard - crew members can leave if they are unhappy, but in my game they did not yet. You gain money permanently, but you decide what to spend it on and when - so you should never reach 0. But still their is enough micromanagment possible to make your base work better and better.\n\nThey strategy part is nice to have, but easy to handle. If you level your crew up to fast, they demand goods you can only produce with later ressources. So you have to ensure to get this resources quick before your crewmembers leave. You have to decide, if you want to spend money on gather resource or put personal on the systems embassady, to maximize the output of the system.\n\nThe tactial realtime combat part makes a lot of fun, i easy at the start but get very difficult later. Each planet can be played in 3 levels, normal, hard and wtf. And if one crew member "dies", he just goes to stasis and can join you later after the mission - so its not so frustating, as you dont lose long trained crew members.\n\nThe RPG Part seems to be not so important, but later in the game the importance grows. You have 5 different types of crewclasses and each member has its own "carreer" to get better. Addionally each class hat 6 equipmentslots for equipment of a specific type. The carreer attributes can buff your abilites to work on the station or buff equipmentslots to get additional stats for the missions on the planet. This does not matter at the start. But in my game for example, i recognized with level 22 crew, that my doctor is always close to dying and has a lot less life then all the other crewmembers, even with the best equipment. When i checked his carreer i saw that this guy has 0 % bonus on life, where the other members had 50-90%. But therefor he was a perfect worker, so threw him out of the landing crew and picked up another doctor who was level 20, but had already 65% bonus life.\n\nAnd in this more then 25 gaming hours i did not find a single bug.... this is really impressive. Ok the pathfinding is not perfect and the crew does not always the most clever thing, but everything work. And each option they a thought of while playing, is already there - but sometimes not easy to find (Sort crew by class would be nice - Ahhh, there is the button on the bottom of the list / Some statistic would be nice - Ahh, below the notifications there statistics to show me almost everything).\n\nI bought this game just for some our between other really good games.... now i have more than 25 gaming hours in less then a week and dont play anything else. So i suggest to buy this game. For me it is PERFECT!\n\nUpdate 6.4.2015: Played 50 hours now and finished the campaign at normal difficulty. On the 2nd run i will make a lot different - so here some hints:\n\n- Visitors and crew always want to fulfill their highest demand. This means if food is on 40 and sleep on 39, they will run and get sleep, even if they are in the bistro and would be more clever to eat first. After sleeping the will run back to bistro, but wasted much time.\n- Each person has different demand and craves. Later it makes sense to reduce rooms which fulfill demand on lower levels. Nevertheless you still need all of them, because some persons want special stuff from low level rooms. Example: Later i build about 10 suites all around the base and deleted my 3 baracks, but kept one. So i force the people to use the better beds to gain more sleep at a time. But some still need the low level soap, so i kept one barrack, without beds, but 2 showers.\n- You can build large rooms (you really have enough space), but it makes no sense. You need to build more than one room of the same type at different locations, so people dont waste time to run around your whole base to fulfill 2 or more demands. So i built many small rooms of the same time everywhere.\n- Use corridors and security gates. With this you can ensure that vistors and worker dont get into the same areas. This way you can optimize the paths between the rooms for both of them. If you ways go through rooms, this get more difficult and you need to change gate settings many times to build.\n- Free your landing crew from production so they gain happiness faster, cause they fulfill demands faster and you can do mission after mission - but let them still be builder for rooms and so on. If they got stuck behind some security gates in the visitors area, they will be free after doing the next mission.\n- Free the workers from building, so they dont run long ways between building and production.\n- If you feel unpowered, use lemurian sniper rifle and rockets to kite your enemies - it take some time but you will be able too finish each fight successfully.","April 4, 2015","true","53.2"," 45 of 47 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","45","47","0","0"

This video gives you a good idea of what the game is actually like to play as the narrator explores it, although there have been some improvements since the video was made on 14 Jan 2015. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwTi-Vilyw8\n\nGeneralA very fun and very reasonably priced little game. I think that there are a fair few “Spacebase Refugees” that have come to look at The Spatials. This is a completed game, although the devs seem to have ideas for improvement in the future. Speaking of the devs, Carlos is very good about responding to questions and concerns and generally communicating with the community.\n\nThe Spatials is a weird mix of activities, including base building, “dungeon” exploration, looting, production lines, economy simulation, and character simulation (meeting their needs/keeping them happy). Despite all of these different things sounding too disparate, the game does come together into a cohesive whole which is fun and different. I would say that there is room in the future to strengthen each segment of the game and expand upon them, but right now this is a completed game which (as all games should) stands to be improved upon.\n\nThe humour is delightful and it’s great to have a game where you don’t feel too much pressure (yet if you want to challenge yourself with low level characters on a high level planet you can!).\n\nAll in all, considering that I've played 30 hours of this game already, and I'm likely to play another 30 of it and get all the achievements now that it's on Steam - I'd say that it's a good game, a fun game, and a great buy. If this is your sort of thing, it will entertain you for ages too!\n\nGameplayMost of your gameplay does consist of away missions, exploring the planet and defeating all the enemies. This gets a little monotonous after a while. There could be a tad more variety in the fauna, flora, and layout of planets as well as in the mission objectives.\n\nBack at the asteroid though, you build up your base by choosing what to build and where to build it, albeit you probably want to eventually build at least one of everything. The idea is you need different sorts of rooms to provide goods to visitors (to earn money) and to your officers (to keep them happy). This includes things like sleep, hygiene, food variety, intellectual stimulation, and entertainment.\n\nOne fun feature of the game that is right up my alley is the inclusion of collectables. You have a garden and a museum room which allow you to show off your collectables, and you find the collectables whilst exploring planets. (Tip: they are generally found somewhere around the centre of a planet so that you don’t have to search every square inch of every planet).\n\nControlsI find mostly use the mouse, and it would be a little tricky to not use the mouse. On away missions there are hotkeys for using each character’s special ability.\n\nStorylineThere isn’t a story per se, however I’ve only got about halfway through the galaxy. There are hints at a storyline as you do major missions to unlock the next solar system, however this isn’t a story-driven sort of game.\n\nSoundNothing amazing, nothing bad. The music is quite fun, although some tracks get on my personal nerves due to some repetitive high pitch noises. Meanwhile the phaser fire during fights can get quite monotonous. However this is a case of not being able to think of much to say about the sound, I just didn’t find it particularly remarkable.\n\nGraphicsI really enjoy the artwork in this game. It’s got a clear style and it sticks with it. The interesting thing is how the art style supports the game’s attitude of being a little bit of a star trek farce - it doesn’t take itself too seriously and doesn’t want the player to take it too seriously either.\n\nI’ve had a lot of fun with the randomized portraits and my imagination to find characters that look vaguely like other characters. So far I’ve found a Locutus, Jean Luc Picard, Beverly Crusher, Geordi LaForge, Miles O’brien, The Doctor, Tom Paris, Katherine Janeway, Kes, Julian Bashir, B’elanna Torres, Wesley Crusher, and Lando Cairissian. I’ve also found a TARDIS collectable, which totally made my day.\n\nPros+ complete and fun game to play\n+ great potential, great concept\n+ fun artwork\n+ interesting universe\n+ supportive devs\nCons- sounds could use some work\n- could use more depth\n- some UI organization could be improved upon\n\nHelp Me Help YouPlease\n• give me constructive criticism in the comments - tell me why the review wasn’t helpful\n• upvote my Steam review if you liked it so that others are more likely to find it too!\n\nRothana's Steam Review ArchiveFor those that are interested in seeing more of my reviews, I have set up an archive of them at an external website. I don't earn anything off of this at all, it's just a little side project that I add to when I can. Steam won't let me create a direct link though, so you'll need to make your own way to the URL I describe now: rothana dot weebly dot com\n\nFootnotes\n*Any prices that I mention are in CDN because that is what I see.\n**I bought the game before its release on Steam. =)\n***I will not be keeping an eye on whether the links are up to date, so if they are broken I apologise.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/346420/","strategikal","Strategikal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/","1935 products in account","My first impression of this game after 4 hours of play is pretty good. In spite of the kiddy graphics there's a surprising amount of depth to this game. Each game is randomly generated giving you a different experience each time. I haven't played too far into the game yet so I don't know how it develops later on, but I'm certainly enjoying the early game.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/NVt57iFHjX8\nThe Spatials is basically split into two parts: first you have a base-building tycoon style game, second you have a real time RPG game where characters go on missions, level up and so on.\n\nBase building is the core of the game, your goal is to build a large space station that will attract many visitors from different alien races, supply them with their needs and of course, make money out of them. To do this you'll not only need to build the station, but supply it with resources, and there are many different resources to be found on the hundred or so planets out there.\n\nResearch is necessary to unlock new room and equipment types and there's a tech tree that you progress through, making your station more advanced over time. To unlock new techs you need to gain research points by going on missions. This is also how you discover and acquire the resources you need.\n\nYour station requires staff. There are five different types of characters, obviously modelled on Star Trek - the diplomat, the science officer, the doctor, the strategist and the engineer, each with colour coded uniforms making it easy to tell them apart. Not only do they work in the station but more importantly, they go on missions to various planets. This is where the real time RPG part of the game comes in.\n\nEach character possesses different skills and items. Going on missions gains them experience which causes them to level up and further develop their skills. They also develop increasingly sophisticated needs that must be fulfilled, like certain foods for example. Oddly, their only need at the beginning of the game is sleep, apparently they don't even need to eat at the start, which is just as well, because you don't have any food or the means to cook it.\n\nMissions consist of choosing five characters, landing on a planet and performing certain tasks, like destroying enemy bases and so on. The combat is pretty simple once you get the hang of it, with each character having a certain special skill that can be activated with a keypress (1-5). It's very important to keep pressing the 4 button to keep healing your characters. They can't actually die in combat, but if their health is reduced to zero they are put "in stasis", so they can no longer take part in the mission. If this happens to all your characters then you've failed the mission. You can easily try it again later though, perhaps with different characters and equipment.\n\nOnce you've won a mission you get certain rewards, such as resources and items, as well as experience and research points. You also have access to the planet's resources, which you can start harvesting, to add to your station inventory. You can upgrade your characters with new skills and new weapons to make them stronger in future missions.\n\nYou can also accept contracts which are like missions, but you don't actually play the mission, you just send up to three officers on the mission, pay a fee and get a result a few minutes later.\n\nNew staff members can be recruited at embassies, and every system has one career mission which unlocks a new star system. Over time, enemies grow stronger and your characters level up, making them stronger. All the while you have to keep growing your base and providing more and more services for the visiting aliens.\n\nWhile the graphical style is a retro isometric view, it's detailed and colourful and serves its purpose. It won't win any prizes but that's not what the game is about. The gameplay is straightforward, easy to learn and enjoyable. It may become quite challenging to satisfy all of your visitor's needs once the station grows large enough, but I haven't got that far in the game yet.\n\nMy first impression though, is very good. It's a fun game, an interesting challenge, and very relaxing to play. I recommend it.","April 5, 2015","true","7.6"," 47 of 56 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","47","56","0","9"

I usually don't like this kind of games, but this one is really well made and, after some struggling at the beginning, managed to keep me interested.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:You have to build your own base on a planet. This planet is frequently visited by humans and aliens that you have to satisfy with your services. For those services, you need some products and materials that you can get by completing missions and cleaning other planets from pirates. You fly with your chosen crew across the universe, kill pirates, collect materials, help other people and upgrade your crew members' stats.\n\nPros:    A very big amount of content.\nVisuals are simple and good-looking.\nEvery crew member has his own abilities such as grenades, sniper guns and healing teammates.\nBeside regular missions, you can also conquer other planets. After beating a level, you also get to play it on 'hard' and 'WTF?!' difficulty.\nWeapons that you find no good use for can be recycled into different, high-level weapons or abilities.\nThe galaxy you're playing in is randomly generated. That is pretty awesome except if you manage to fall into a galaxy that has extreme lack of some material. But that is just bad luck.\nThere is a so called 'Tech Tree' from where you can unlock a lot of new room types, products ...\nIn most cases, you can't afford to lose even one crew member, so the game makes you think a bit and make a strategy\nI'm not a very rich man, but the price is very low for this kind of game.\nLinux and MacOS support\nWhen you click on another window (I have two monitors), the screen doesn't flicker like crazy, when it tries to exit full-screen mode. This might not mean to some people, but it's great for me as I chat a lot.\nCons:    There is a tutorial in this game, but it tells you pretty much nothing. I finished it and still had no clue what I had to do. I had to figure out things by myself and it almost made me quit. But once you manage to get started, things become very obvious.\nNo multiplayer. I'm sure that it would fit very nicely into this game.\nThings to do on non-mission planets are very repetitive. Missions are sometimes, too, but the story manages to cover that up.\nBecause of the 3D view, it's sometimes hard to place the buildings and items correctly. However, you get the hang of it quickly so it's not a big deal.\nSuggestions:This game needs a better tutorial. Badly. The existing one tells you some basics about your base, but it keeps quiet when it comes to upgrading your base, traveling, material gathering ... Luckily, the community responds to any questions to have.\nAlso, there could be some kind of an "idling" thing embedded into this game. When you're not playing the game, the progress stands still. I'm sure this would attract a lot of people.\n\nThe final verdict:Once I managed to pass that initial phase where I just couldn't figure out what to do, this game offered a great amount of content and, most importantly, fun. The game is great to look at, you have lots of missions and you can upgrade you crew member's abilities.\nIf you're into that kind of games, I definitely suggest you to buy it. I think it's great fun and it offers a lot of gameplay hours.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sporkmonger/recommended/346420/","sporkmonger","Sporkmonger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sporkmonger/","1586 products in account","There's a lot about The Spatials to like, and a lot that falls flat. The away team leveling process is pretty cool and works reasonably well as a game mechanic. The base building and visitor attraction mechanic is a cool concept, though the economics of it are extremely simplistic and not really that interesting. There's also a big mismatch between when nodes in the research tree unlock and when the corresponding resources required to use the stuff you've researched unlocks. You end up with a substantial amount of time where you can't use anything you've researched. Worse, later on, once you hit level 13 or 14 officers, their vital needs get complex enough that if you happen to fail a mission and they become unhappy, you can't raise their happiness levels back up in time to keep them from leaving, even if they started at near-full before the mission began. And because you lose all their items when they leave, it's hard to replace people.\n\nEssentially, there are major game balance issues right now that keep the game from reaching its full potential. But the game is also a diamond in the rough. Fixing the game balance issues really shouldn't really be that hard. A few of the planets around level 6 or 7 should get a couple of the more advanced resources sprinkled in to tide you over until level 10 or so when the advanced resources really start becoming available in bulk. The AI for officers should be smarter about fulfilling their vital needs and cravings more quickly so that they don't time out when unhappy through no fault of the player. It's certainly possible right now to get totally screwed by suboptimal base design, but you don't know the base design is suboptimal until you're frantically trying to make someone happy again with a timer ticking on you. And the game needs a lot more variety in the missions, particularly in terms of different types of enemies. Every mission is the same couple enemies with very little variety. After the 10000th pirate you kill, it gets a little monotonous.\n\nIf the game is on sale for < $5, or if they fix these issues, it's worth your time, otherwise, probably not.","April 1, 2015","false","6.0"," 45 of 63 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","45","63","3","1"

Your goal is simple. Spread your influence, and please your customers with the most efficient tourist attraction this side of the Milky Way!\nIn all, this Action/Tycoon game has enough to bite into and be enjoyed. However it does have a bit of a learning curve. Even with the tutorials your progression is simply up to you to figure out. (Don't worry about setting up your station at start and focus more on away missions right away.) Also The Spatials is a game that will require quite a bit of time investment to get anything really going. Making sure that you can meet the supply and demand of your ravenous guests. The game is a solid tycoon game but expect more of a relaxed experience then something fast paced. There really isn't a way to lose for that matter.\nWith little to no bugs to speak of. Spatials is very well put together. The only area it may lack is in replay. There really isn't much pushing you to make any station after you've gone through all that work. So if your looking for a factory/tycoon game with decent graphics, fun away missions and plenty of upgrades. An action element and relaxed gameplay. The Spatials is a solid choice.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/SzNTuJgAlrs\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","April 1, 2015","true","2.9"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","23","28","0","3"

It is deep, well balanced, well thought out, and runs very smooth.  It also included a help screen and a tutorial assistant that can be closed until needed at any time.  You will likely need to use the help resources a few times however as this game is very deep and complex.  The brilliance comes with th games simplicity however.  While it offers a lot to do, it never feels overwhelming and everything makes sense.\n\nYou start off with 5 random people as your crew in a tiny little room on some distant asteroid far, far away.  Every crew member has a name and a purpose and starts off at level 1.  At this early level their only needs to keep them happy and working for you is a place to sleep.  Easy enough, just use your starting 10,000 credits to have them build on add on room and toss in some beds.  They don't require micro-management and work without having to babysit them at all, which I love.\n\nSo now you got them a little space station started.  Next room to build is a warehouse, get another warehouse room added on and toss in some storage vaults and a recycling machine to help keep your inventory clean and uncluttered.\n\nPerfect.  Now what?\n\nWell, start exploring the vastness of this procedurally generated galaxy that is your game.  Start by looking in your own system and clicking on other plants or asteroids to conquer.  Conquer them by completing the missions given to you on said planet, usually killing mobs or boss mobs.  Once you conquer the planet, you now have access that worlds rescources.  Now use your points you've obtained conquering planets to research no technology on new stuff to make for your base.  Add on more rooms and more cool stuff.\n\nPretty soon, you'll be ready to host aliens from other universes to come and stay at your base, and by supplying them with food, drink and items that want to buy, you'll make them happy and start acquiring money.\n\nRinse and repeat, as you start conquering and exploring planets further and further out, as the difficulty increases, and as your base grows in insane sizes.\n\nIt's a brilliant game that seems to offer a bewildering level of depth, explortation, and balance.  But most importantly it is just plan FUN to play.\n\nThere isn't many Indie games that launch with the level of heart, soul, and quality that this little game contains in abundance.\n\nThis game is easily worth double it's asking price in my opinion because it is loaded with so much to do, so much to research, and so much to build.  At its current price tag, this is a no brainer for any fan of simulation or RPG fans.  Go click "Buy" and you'll thank me later.\n\nMy Early Rating...  88% out of 100.

The art is great, the nonsense is nonsensical and the writing is a great blend of camp and irony. The progression system does a good job of slowly growing the complexity of your civilization and the RPG progression of your officers helps to make them stand out. The entire game is approachable and enjoyable.\n\nCons\nIt doesn't take long to start feeling the grind. You start to go on away missions solely for a single resource you ran out of and the tech tree falls to the side as you quickly get so many new technologies that you just don't have the resources to really capitalize on them. At this stage, the tutorial is a little rough. It falls in the gap between needing a wiki and not. The game is simple enough that you'll get by fine without external sources, but if you don't know how to do something, most likely the tutorial will not explain it.\n\nOverall, I would say The Spatials is a great game as long as you're looking for something more approachable than Rim World or Dwarf Fortress, but not to the same level. An awesome starter for the genre and a ton of fun.","June 9, 2015","true","3.9"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

I love sci-fi, and I love base building. This game fails on too many fronts.\n\n- "Exploration" The mechanic of sending your teams out to constantly ♥♥♥♥, pillage and plunder every planet reminds me of the move Full Metal Jacket.\nI wanted to see exotic Planet BLAH BLAH... the crown jewel of Southeast Arm of Galaxy Tiddlywinks. I wanted to meet interesting and stimulating people of an ancient culture... and kill them. I wanted to be the first kid on my block to get a confirmed kill!\nI've gotten to level 12 planets and all of the away missions are these pedantic kill squad missions. You have a diplomat, science officer, and engineer on your away team, but your ONLY MISSION IS KILLSQUADS. Just lemme take all Marines, that's all we do. To make matters worse, the combat is so horrifically basic, all you do is click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click, your people won't defend themselves even. Then you sometimes can't see enemys obscured by trees, and your wishing you had an app that left clicked for you. Exploration and combat are utter rubbish.\n\n- Diplomacy is at least a little unique and interesting. You take your officers and place them in positions of power on a solar system's capitol planet, cool right? Except now the only thing you are is a mechanism for exploiting the natural resources of the planets. That's it. There's no diplomacy, you're basically a lobbyist. I feel like I'm in Avatar, I go in, kill the indiginous population, and secure my natural resources. There's no other function for diplomats.\n\n- Basebuilding is like the key of the game right? That's what you're in this for. You build a base..... to become a Mall of America. Your sole goal is to build a base that caters to the whims of the consumers who come and go, as you ♥♥♥♥ planets as a wonton hedonist. You need that bug pizza? No problem, lemme just ensure I've killed everything on this planet over here, ok check, now let's install an officer to ensure I get all the bugs from this planet.. Yep.. Ok, Supply line secured - you get your bug pizza.\n\nBase upkeep is a CHORE. The stations don't have a 'build XX minimum'  - so you have build YY total, or build infinity. When you are building 120 different items, having to consantly queue up crap is loathsome and pedantic. THERE IS A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS. I ended up rage quitting after a while, because I got so sick of having to tell my people to keep the ♥♥♥♥ing ice cream maker filled. It's like an intergalactic mcdonalds staffed by level 10 officers who have no maturity at all.\n\nGood things? Graphics are pretty good, I enjoyed the "not Prison Architecht or Rimworld" style meeples. It's has it's own graphic identity and I appreciate that. The music and sound effects are equally nice.\n\nOtherwise this thing is rage material.","April 4, 2015","false","6.4"," 27 of 40 people (68%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","68","27","40","9","0"

The squad-based real-time combat portion feels like the controls are incomplete (where's the option to "fight things you run into while moving"?). This suggests that the station construction and management should be the main focus, producing bonuses for the squad to make up for the reduced controls. However, the only bonus that can be gotten from the station is xp, and only at early levels (according to the help screens). This in turn makes the station management seem nearly pointless, in addition to the lack of achievements for doing well at it, as the main goal of managing the station becomes simply supplying all the needs of your away team so that they don't quit on you or go into combat with penalties. The tourists are self-balancing: the only penalty, at least so far, for not satisfying all of their desires is that they arrive more slowly. Station constructions are limited by the away team's adventures, both by the need for tech points (gained from exploration, not building/research) and by the need for resources. So both the combat portion and the building portion are crippled: the former by poor controls; the latter by lack of incentive and challenge.","April 4, 2015","false","11.2"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","2"

The UI is incredibly fluid and it didn't take long for me to understand the basics and what all of the different buttons did.  It has a lot of interesting ideas, one being that officer needs are unlocked as you level up.  Instead of starting with an empty base full of officers that will require all sorts of things from the get-go, you'll only need to initially address sleep and eventually work your way up to things like hunger. I enjoyed the colony sim/action RPG mix...that is, you'll be managing a colony and building a station but will be required to do "away team missions" to different planets in order to gain tech points (to unlock items in a tech tree) and resources (to make said items).  There's a lot to do here for the $13 price tag and luckily, wasn't abandoned mid-development...you know who you are.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4S1FWrKaVM","April 2, 2015","true","12.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

It is one of those rare gems that you can run for hours and hours only to realize the sun has come up and you may need to sleep at school/work before putting in another night with this game.\n\nIt is also available for Linux (currently as a beta), which is a big plus.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes.\n\nThere are, however, some issues that may affect gameplay:\n1. While the soundtrack does a good job of being ambient enough to not be an immediate bother, it starts to get grating when you're playing it for several hours at a time. Grating as in there's this one track that sounds as if it's glitching and it gets annoying fast.\n2. There is no way for tall objects (Like the spaceport) to become transparant while moused over or when using the wall-removal button, making it fairly difficult to see what may be built directly behind them.\n3. Apparently you can't put corridors side-by-side, yet there's no obvious other room that could be used to make corridors which are two or more squares wide. Yet, when exploring planets somehow someway the people building there CAN add corridors side-by-side, making for some interesting doorway and hallway combinations.\n4. You can't (de-)construct the initial teleport room, mostly because it's the only place where your officers spawn. But you can't build anything in there, not even ornaments, making it a fairly useless 3x3 square block. (5x5 if you consider you can't put rooms up against other rooms.) It's also the only place which has walls with big giant windows which I'm sure my visitors would enjoy seeing on the outer edges of my spaceport. From a glance at the research tree, there's also no way to unlock being able to (de-)construct this particular room type. I would welcome the opportunity to expand upon it and use it as a 3x3 hallway with ornaments, but alas.\n5. Emptying your inventory during a crisis gives you 1C for stacks of 0~1999 units, 2C for stacks of 2000~2999 units, and so on. It's pretty much useless even while you'd imagine there's a bit more compensation for the hard work your officers put into making end-products as opposed to raw materials. This is not taken into account at all and all stacks are treated equally in this.\n6. When sorting officers, the three category buttons do not have their expected behaviour. When all are turned off, one should see the entire list, which happens fine. But when sorting on only diplomats, one still sees the entire list. When sorting on only exploration crew, one still sees the entire list. It is confusing. A similar sorting option is lacking at the Diplomat screen, where I often have to scroll past my exploration team and already assigned diplomats before getting to the candidates I can actually put in the vacant slot I am trying to fill. This could use some optimization.\n7.a. Officers will walk away from big building projects after they have only put down one piece of floor or an object instead of being automatically assigned the next build order since they are the closest worker to it. Especially in big projects this may lead to officers from the farthest reaches of your station to come wandering over, slowing down the build project immensely.\nb. In a similar manner; officers will randomly decide to hop from one factory module to another without clear indication of what is behind their decision to do so. They would make one dessert only to hop over to the machine next to it and make another dessert at it, only to then walk over to another factory room and start making spare parts. And this is with enough officers in the station to occupy all of the factory objects simultaneously.\n\nSo yes, the game runs stable (Tested on Windows 7 & Debian 8). It's playable. It's enjoyable. It could use some optimization, but there has never been a perfect game.\nSo, If you're happy enough dealing with the issues I listed in this review, by all means buy the game. It /is/ enjoyable to play and a decided timesink.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, this is what Double Fine's Spacebase DF-9 could have been. And it made me think of games like MuckyFoot's Startopia in terms of station-building, a real-time version of MicroProse's UFO/X-Com series in terms of planet-exploration/combat, and even Sierra's Alien Legacy which had attempted to combine the two elements before.","April 1, 2015","true","74.5"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

You started out with one room on an empty asteroid surface with a few employees. The goal is to explore neighboring planets and galaxies to exploit more resources to build up your home base.\n\nThe control interface is easy to learn, although I wish there would be more guidance on manufacturings. However, after a few trial and errors, you can definitively get a handle on those things.\n\nThe main thing here to progress through the game is to send your employees to explore other planets and gain expereince, resources and money. There are a lot of planets, so you wouldn't worry about play time; if you do though, you can always revisit those planets to get bonuses. So far I feel this game follows a linear progression, that is explore-upgrade-explore, interspersed with quirky story lines here and there. But I have yet to explore the majority of the galaxies out there, I will update my review once I finish it.\n\ntl;dr\n\nPro: Rich content and long gameplay\nCon: Simple, somewhat linear, progression\n\n8/10","April 1, 2015","true","34.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

It has station building, civ. building, some action (the away missions), character management and... deep space exploration.\n\nThe game is a lot of fun. Even when the genre might not be your faved terms of playing. It has a lot to offer and exploration often is a very good thing for earning resources, items or to unlock items for you station.\n\nStill, the developers work a lot on this game, soon there will be a new release with some new options, and already the game is a lot of fun. Though, I want to add, I would like more missions, planets and sectors (maybe even Aliens)... Maybe the wish will come true... maybe three or more sectors, even if it's on an purchasable add on, would be nice.\n\nPros: The style of the game is cute, and yet not an overkill in cuteness. You might take different approaches during gameplay to solve a tough foe.Personal management can be painful, no not in a bad way... but with officers quiting you'll have to improvise for some time.Atmospheric and stylish soundtrack that isn't going on the nerves.\nCons:Might get quite repetetive and grinding over time.\nRecommended? Hell, YES!\nGiven, the game has one or two shortcomings it is a great game, you start to play it and suddenly... Oups? Four hours gone? Really? Darn... It is a lot of fun to try becoming better during the game, even if that sometimes means that your faved officer suddenly goes AWOL... and seeing them getting better and better with destructions also is a nice... and cute notion... Bombs away.\n\nIs there a reason not to like this game? Yes, maybe, you can get quite into grinding when trying to get the optimum gear and sometimes a Level One Blaster *** or a Extra Power Level One *** is far better than a Level Ten without a star. So you have to take care what upgrades go to which character... and it's quite a good way to play the game with two to four reserve teams.\n","December 24, 2015","true","55.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You set up your base not just to make money from customers but to satisfy your officers whom get more demanding as they level up. So as your going on missions you're not always going to want to pick your A listers out of fear they'll level up before you can get everything ready for they're new desires. I love this small mechanic. Add to that, your officers are the ones whom do the grunt work at your base. Be it building new sections, making spare parts, or cooking up some food you really should leave someone to take care of that. Why, because eveything is happening in realtime. Just becaue your on a mission doesn't mean things pause back at homebase. This is why I can forgive the simplistic controls on the Action side of things. It would just get too complicated and hectic for many players. Still wish they would let you move Officers individually though. Also know that the tutorial is very passive, relying on the players curiosity.

This game has elements of some of my favorite classic sim and rpg games. Visually it reminds me of Roller Coaster Tycoon 2, but in space and theres no rides. Start off colonizing an asteroid, and build a station to sustain your crew. Explore nearby planets to obtain resources and credits. After completing the planets mission, use credits to unlock the planets resource nodes to import goods to your station after a time period. Hire new crew members and employ them at the solar system's embassy to reduce the time period it takes to extract resources from the planets in the system. Once you get supplies rolling in start building for guests to visit the station and spend credits, and expand accordingly. Explore the galaxy and unlock alien races to visit your space station, play through missions and discover your enemy. Visitors will be satisfied if they can fulfill their cravings before leaving the station.\n\nIt can be very easy to get ahead of yourself in this game, and if you're not careful you can unlock the expansion nodes too early before you have set up incoming resources and will constantly trying to keep products in stock and guests satisfied. I advise new players to unlock the research nodes as your crew members or visitors need them. You can unlock the next level by beating the first planet in the solar system, but skipping planets will limit your production. Also planets have difficulty levels, and clearing a higher difficulty will increase the resources a planet produces per period, so there is replayability even after completing the first levels.\n\nThere are two ways to level your crew in the game, by defeating enemies on planets with your away team, or sending crew members out on contracts for experience, resources or items. The contract system is great for hiring new crew and levelling them up to be ambassadors for a solar system's embassy. A strategy I recommend to start is hiring low level crew members as workers, and choose specific ones to level with contracts. As a crew member's level raises, so does their cravings and needs, which take away from production time and takes longer to get in a good mood. Higher level crew members will consume more advanced products which could be sold to guests instead, but also have production bonuses so you will have to balance your worker's levels with your available resources. Also item drops will increase your away crew's power, so equipping higher level items makes a lower level away team stronger.\n\n9/10 I recommend this game to anyone who loves theme park style games and space exploration rpgs. It has a fun and colorful art style. There is room for it to grow, so far I don't think the camera angle can be rotated to see the station from different directons but otherwise its a great start from new devs, thanks guys!

The rules aren't complicated, they're just not explained well through the tutorial or interface. Once you've got them figured out, the rest of the game is just grinding.\n\nThe grinding is really obvious too - enemies are just "Pirate (lvl 10)", weapons are "Phaser (lvl 10)", the buildings & activities have different names, but it's obvious that each level is just an improved version of the previous level. There's no complex supply chain, nor any high level unlockables that make the game interesting again.\n\nOptimizing your base feels more like a chore than anything - if you try to make neat, isolated rooms, you're wasting 50% of your space and you won't make much profit.

I had one planet with Nitrogen in a level 10 system... than the next one in a system level 14. That mean that I didn't have enough Nitrogen to craft sufficient amount of goods for not only my crew but also my visitors, which mean I got double screwed, I tried to rush to get to the system with more Nitrogen, but when I tried to do so I had to face the issue that my crew wasn't strong enough to pull out the missions, so on one hand I need those resources quickly, on the other my crew can't stand it, I would need to get them both trained AND properly skilled, but that take time, but my crew is slowly getting dissatisified by my lack of goods that require Nitrogen, so I don't have time, so I am more or less stuck between two annoying issues that are squeezing on me, and I can't do miracles. At this point the odds for these resources to pop in from 10 onward should be FAR greater than it is right now, otherwise basically the game become too hard to progress through.\n\nI get that some games like FTL to be based on luck, usually those are 'rogue-like' games, but this one isn't a 'rogue-like' type game, its a 'builder' type game that it be so much possibly based on the luck of the draw and waste many hours of work is foolish, also luck mess with another element which is foolish, the skills, the stats on the skill levels are random, which mean a level 1 skill can be better than a level 5 skill for example, at some point I can accept some... range... on the stats, but that fact that the skill level basically mean virtually nothing however is ridiculous.\n\nThe stats of the skills should be growing in layers, and when you reach the next level the stats than can't turn worse than a previous level skills, otherwise its ridiculous, sending crews on high level contracts that earn skills only for those skills to turn out worse than some much lower level skills you already have is a waste of both time and money. I mean their is the stars... I could accept that a level 1 skill with 1 star got the stats equal to a starless level 2, and a 2 star level 1 could equal a starless level 3, and so on, but it goes far beyond that in range of stats.\n\nI can accept the place of luck to some level in such game, but if whatever you can win or lose the entire game become based on it rather than player skills than the game effectively become a coin toss... and that isn't a fun game at all.\n\nStill, the question of whatever I would recommend the game or not, is... ambiguous... the results of my first game aren't all positive, the next one could be better... the fact I have to restart from scratch probably to get the good run is an annoyance considering it means I'd have wasted alot of time already, not because of lack of skills, I was doing good beyond the crew & resource issues. But even all things considered, this game has alot going for it, otherwise, I like the whole building and managing, the fact you have to manage both your crew and your visitors is interesting too, managing resources and crew isn't a bad thing, I mean its better than merely employing tons of mindless drones like in the 'theme park' games, I like that, but if it becomes too tedious its an issue.\n\nNow I think I would still recommend this game, even with my complaints its still pretty good, it got issues, but those could be resolved in updates to 'balance' things out, than it would be golden, I'd get it for sale however since for now considering its issues I'd consider it worth a few dollars less than its currently is sold for, but if the game is going to be heavily luck based like FTL, than its not worth more than FTL, at least with FTL you don't have several hours of work put into it before you are faced with a point in the game where you lose because of bad luck.","June 26, 2015","true","23.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's way more in depth and almost has the Dwarf Fortress feel I've been looking for. I played 6 hours on the first night I got it, so that says a lot. There's a bit of a learning curve and it has these different modes that the game forces you to play: base-building, RTS, RPG, and management. To advance building your base, you need to venture out into space in search of other planets to get the resources you need. You can then assign three officers per solar system to produce resouces at those solar systems quicker so that you don't need to constantly keep going out to space. Eventually you will have to level up your officers to get the next level of resouces to fulfill the needs of higher level officers (it's all relative). The item level also isn't dependent on the level of each officer, which is good, but you have to have officers at a high enough level to get them in the first place.\n\nHonestly, this game has a lot of depth, and tafter 6 hours of playing I still feel like I'm only 1/4 of the way to end game (maybe?) and I there's a lot of replayability, unless you don't like the grind and repetiveness.

At first it's a bit hard to get a grasp on everything, but eventually things become clear. You'll discovered that this game is rather shallow. It feels neither challenging nor particularly rewarding. I've spent about 7 hours on it now, and don't feel particularly compelled to keep playing.\n\nIt's a game that holds promise, but the reality is, sadly, a lack-luster game.

Unfortunately there is not and this lack of challenge and depth quickly becomes noticeable.

To do this, you need to put together a team to send on away missions to local planets; Success allows you to buy access to local resources, unlock tech, and progress to new systems. There's nothing wrong with the game, it just feels like most of the game mechanics are just slightly off. They either don't quite go far enough, or seem to be more complicated then necessary.\n\nAn example of this is the resource collection. Once you complete an away mission you can buy resource nodes on that planet, which deliver raw crafting mats to the station for you to use. The system is complicated by the fact that you need to devote officers to the system in order to speed up harvesting, and that you can repeat a planet at harder difficulties to get more resources. While playing I never felt that this added anything to the game, it just prolonged the grind required to get some resource chains up and running.\n\nAnother example is the crafting system. You put down rooms and stations for your officers to create new consumables for your visitors to buy. You need to queue up the number of each item you want to create at the crafting section, but volumes fluctuate so rapidly it's rarely useful to set anything but 'build infinite' at each station. It feels like they were setting up a system that allowed you to 'keep x items in inventory', but it was never finished or too complicated to work properly. As a result you either need to over recruit to keep all crafting going or micromanage, which is almost impossible because the station operates while on away missions.\n\nThere may be systems in place that handle my grievances but the tutorials are terrible. They're not much more then a text overlay and they only cover the most basic systems in the game. You will have to figure a lot out for yourself.\n\nIf you're willing to put up with some rough sections, the Spatials is a pretty decent game. The mechanics are solid, and there's enough progression to keep you going for quite awhile. I recommend it, just have an idea what you're getting into before buying.","April 13, 2015","true","10.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You build a base for your crew, but also for aliens that come to visit you. Then you have to meet the needs of both your crew and the aliens.

It does take some pacing to get the hang of the game and it sorta punishes you for going ahead too fast and not taking over a group of planets, then going onto the next. You'll want to sit back and make sure each planets resources are claimed so that you get them after 3-12 minutes.\n\nYou will also want to recruit officers to man those embassies to make sure the resources come in as often as possible (every 3 minutes.). At that point if money is tough, then repeat some missions or sit back and let visitors into your base, and keep them happy. If you dash ahead you'll research things your resources can't cover and with higher experience you'll get higher levelled officers who's needs are not being met. Pacing!\n\n\nThis is a wonderful game, I would have liked to see upset officers staying and just not working at full capacity instead of leaving the base.

It's got a lovely premise and theme, and the gameplay mix between game modes (strategy and tactics) is very well balanced.\n\nI can't recommend it, though. Its tutorial and help system is not nearly sufficient for the gameplay present. You kind of get thrown into a game and given a few tips, and you're left to figure out stuff on your own. In these days of quest markers and other player-catering behaviour, this 90's throwback to how you treat your player - an obsessive mathematics-inclined nerd - is not how to make games anymore. Don't buy it unless you're willing to put some time into learning what it's all about.\n\nThat said, I eagerly look forward to Weird and Wry's next title, and I hope they either figure out the magic of approaching players and UI design, or hire a designer to guide their methods. The Spatials has touches of genius within it, and at the same time, a voice that suggests neither brother was willing to take the spotlight and argue for the audience's experience or take responsibility for the title.","November 27, 2015","false","5.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Which, is exactly what this game is. What makes it special is that it ADDS so much to that model. The biggest thing being missions that you can control while your Space Station sits idle.

I’m fairly big fan of the city-building sim genre (except for The Sims for reasons I won’t go into now) and Weird and Wry decided to put the genre in space. (It may have been done before, but this is a first for myself.) With a bit of a nostalgic Star Trek look and a bit more complication in the genre than I’ve played, The Spatials has taken a lot of my time lately and I’ll gladly give it more.\n\nSo you start with just an air-lock and you build out from there. You can build a lot of different facilities that one would expect like sleeping and storage areas, but once you get a little further in you can build bars with dance floors (which the humans aren’t too fond of weirdly enough) and sell fancy drinks. I had to do a lot of extra work to get the ingredients to be able to make the drinks, but what are you going to do. I also haven’t got to build a Duty Free shop, but I’m on my way. With as many airports as I’ve been in during my life… I kind of need one in my space port or it just won’t feel finished. *Insert end-game goal here!*\n\n*EDIT* In the middle of writing this I realized that I have actually built the Duty Free shop so the new goal is the build the second version of it and a freaking Holoarea because it’s a Holode… Holoarea and that’s awesome!\n\nThat does bring up a few things that weren’t the clearest in the tutorial. Granted, some of the issues I had could have been solved by… you know… reading, but that’s neither here nor there. Sometimes you’ll do a tutorial and just assume that you can handle the rest of it. Well it turns out, I’m not capable of handling The Spatials without reading the in-game notes (go figure). It is good to know ahead of time, for those of you who haven’t picked it up, that you can build facilities that create items that use materials you can’t get for a while. It is easy enough to unlock more solar systems, but the difficulty goes up as well.\n\nMoving on from there you build the places where food and/or goods get created and then you also have to create a place for your people and the visitors to your space station to purchase or consume the goods. That means if you make a kitchen to make a pizza, you’ll also need a cafeteria where you can sit down and enjoy it (or procure it and enjoy it in this instance). It makes sense, but it’s a nice and small touch that adds a little complexity. I really enjoyed figuring it out and the process of making the space station work efficiently. To really get it, you’ll want to have a little bit of everything crafted just in case someone comes in and is craving pizza or yogurt or a cold one for those who like their drinks shaken, but not stirred (if you’re over 21 of course). You’ve got to be prepared.\n\nIf you want to be completely prepared you’ll have to work for it. While you can expand and conquer more planets, that won’t really help you get enough supplies to be able to create everything fast enough to be able to keep all of your people and visitors clean and satisfied. After beating a mission on a planet, you should go back and beat the harder difficulty setting to double-up on the supplies you get from the planet. (The “WTF” difficulty in later levels are not very nice at all.) Also, remember to hire more people so you can have people to staff the so that you can get your supplies faster as well. It’s a delicate balance between hiring too many, making the right products and having just enough for everyone. The nice part is that it’s not really frustrating to do this, it’s actually quite fun. I’m not completely sure how Weird & Wry managed this, but they did a great job.\n\nLast thing, because I see people complaining about this, there is a little complexity to this game. Not a lot. It’s not overly difficult if you’ve got the capacities to read and remember things. While you may be maintaining your space station and making everyone happy by supplying the proper goods DON’T FORGOT YOUR AWAY TEAM! People complaining about how “you can’t raise their happiness levels back up in time to keep them from leaving” aren’t being very observant. When you’re out on missions you get hungry running around blasting fools and picking things up. Not to mention how dirty you must get. You need to give your people time to get cleaned up or yeh, they will leave. Wouldn’t you? All work and no soap or food make these Spatials look for another port were their fun-meter can be filled properly. (You know… like my station when the bar will actually serves drinks…)\n\nScore: Tasty!\n\nIf you couldn’t tell by all the gushing I’ve been doing during this review… I like The Spatials. Like I’ve mentioned before on Facebook and Twitter, if you’ve liked other city/base-building sims, you should buy The Spatials. With all the building options and intricacies there are to be had and rearranging your base that needs to be done so it’s not ugly, there’s a lot to do here. That and the missions are very entertaining and often quite humorous. The game is well done and a lot of fun. It’s nice to have a game that will give you a good smile along the way.","April 23, 2015","true","7.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Completing the mission lets you harvest resources periodically from that planet.\n\nMeanwhile, you can also send your officers on quests of their own that take time (5m for example) to complete - higher level officers are required to be ambassadors to the galaxies so you have a lowered time on harvesting resources you've unlocked.  The base is built SLOWLY.  It will be a while before you can allow visitors in my experience, because you have to meet their needs.  My first base I built a bunch of stuff and everyone got ticked because I didn't have the stuff they wanted, especially food.\n\nConcentrate on getting resources and officers in the beginning before building a lot of amenities, or even unlocking them in the tech tree.  Some products you need resources for you won't get until you're in the 15th galaxy area, and likely beyond but I've just made it that far, so unlocking extras in the tech tree aren't very beneficial for a while.\n\nIts a very in depth, yet light weight game it never feels like you're grinding.  There's a lot to do, spread out between different tasks and all giving a relaxing feeling.  A lot of upgrades in weapons and abilities for your officers, special decorations and such to find on planets.  The cool part about the planets and missions is they all look different.  There's a lot of graphic content and neat environments to explore.\n\nAbsolutely recommend buying this game.","April 26, 2015","true","79.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Full of goofyness, jokes and sci-fi puns (Star Trek, Star Wars, Space Oddysey, etc.), it is a welcome break from all the tripple A games we got showered over the past 6 months. I love games that do not take themselves seriously. I love games that just let you fool around with them till you feel like it, and then just save and quit, without the feel of being bound to them and forget your real life till you finish it a few times over.\n\nAs usual in my guides, let's take a look at the good and the bad.\n\nThe GOOD:\n\n1. Pleasant, isometric 3D graphics - very nice and colorful, with plenty of goofy looking guys and animals.\n2. Kit-bash of genres - I can list base-building, resource management, exploration, RPG, and I am sure you will find plenty more in this game.\n3. Relaxing gameplay - while you can still lose, you can still enjoy every aspect of the game to its fullest without biting your nails like it is an Ironman Impossible XCOM run. This is a game that allows you to lay back and relax in your chair and click your way to victory.\n4. Great replayability - all the systems in the game are randomly generated, making you adapt to the start that you are given.\n5. A plethora of varying maps - exploration missions take place on a huge variety of pretty maps with varying flora, fauna, climate and enemies.\n6. Very decent tech tree for a game of this calibre - unlocking new technologies allows you to build more rooms and further expand your starbase.\n7. Progress in every aspect of the game - whether it's gear or base expansion, you always feel like adding more stuff to the pot, learning more about the game and seeing more prettier things show up.\n8. Pew-pew-pew lasers - come on, who doesn't like shooting lasers?\n9. Your starbase never gets attacked - you can sit and relax and play for fun. Like fun FUN. Not the "I beat the game, whew" fun.\n10. Multicolored Spatials - strategists, scientists, engies, diplomats and doctors all have a different color. Cute - and a small Star Trek throwback.\n11. Character progression - whether you send your guys on away missions or on tasks (AI controlled missions with % chance of success), they always progress and you won't have anyone lagging behind.\n12. Progression is meaningful - leveling your guys actually matters. You need leveled guys as ambassadors on conquered systems. No more slave labor!\n13. You dont lose Spatials - when they get knocked out, they go in stasis and can reappear after a while or through a skill, allowing you to relax and play.\n14. Wonderful music to fit the whole Sci-fi theme.\n\nThe BAD:\n\n1. Exploration missions are a pure rinse and repeat - go kill this guy, go kill another guy, then some more guys, maybe a facility or something inbetween. While there is some variation in the system unlock missions, everything else is painfully average.\n2. Your space base never gets attacked - it could be a turn off for some players, even if I find it a good thing to promote casual gameplay.\n3. You don't lose characters - if a character goes down to 0 health, it immediately goes in stasis, and then reappears on the battlefield after some time, or through a skill. While it promotes casual gameplay, there is no tension and worry about losing someone like it exists in games of the sort of XCOM and This War of Mine.\n4. The huge amount of point and click could be a turn off for some gamers. You can literally do everything with the left and right mouse buttons. Even only the left one.\n\nThe CONCLUSION:\n\nIf you want a casual game that doesn't take itself seriously, with goofy stuff, pretty graphics, lots of great gameplay and very decent replayability, this game is for you.","April 7, 2015","true","46.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This isn't really one of those times. I was sent the game to review, but not on Steam; I liked it enough to buy it immediately upon finishing my play session for review. That doesn't happen often, for what it's worth.\n\nThat out of the way... it's a space base builder mixed with some light dungeon crawling under a Star Trek-ish theme. Both parts are necessary; your officers need the base to support their needs, but you need to explore and effectively conquer planets for their resources to support the base and the people running it. Everything is tied together by the officers and it feels just right.\n\nMy full review is on  IndieGames.com [indiegames.com]","April 8, 2015","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would pay a lot more for this game, had I known it was going to be this much fun.\n\nAt first glance, it's a simple game. Once takes a group of Officers on an Away-Team mission, conquers a planet by completing a quest, then gets the resources of that planet to use in building their base, crafting goods and services for visiting humans and aliens to purchase and use, working their way up a Tech tree to get access to even more goods and services.\n\nBut, it's not really just that simple. One has to acquire the gear for their Officers, level up their Officers, hire more Officers to work shifts and to take on missions while other Officers rest and have a little bit of R&R, satisfying their own needs for food, drink, fun and a bit of rest.\n\nThe decisions ones makes, not only during the mission, but when giving weapons and augments to Officers or choosing the properly outfitted Officers for the mission are critical to their success. Combat isn't just point-and-click, but many times I've found myself having to kite angry robot bosses around a map or manuever my team into a good position to get the drop on a bunch of pirates.\n\nSince I bought the game, I've been playing non-stop, for the most part, only pausing long enough to grab some sleep. And, that's not something I normally do with any game, even the great ones. This game is "special." It's got that "certain something" that demands that I keep coming back to it. Whether it's the constant incentive to journey to the next system or the allure of dropped loot and leveling Officers, or even building the next expansion for the space-station and watching the money roll in as aliens plink away at pinball machines or have a go on the dance floor... Whatever it is, this game has "it." It's fun, it's addicting, it's a great game that doesn't take itself too seriously, but still manages to provide a great experience.\n\nIf you like tactical-rpg, building, crafting, Startopia meets Space Cplony meets Action RPG games, you'll want to buy this game, right now...\n\nI'd buy it again.","April 5, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A lot of games in this genre tend to be quick paced and action oriented, but in this game, you get to work on your base without fear from enemy attacks. A great game if you need a game where you can sit back and relax as you build a diverse entertainment venues for your base. They also have a little squad based RPG system integrated in the game too, if you become bored of the base building part and want to explore some distant planet, star-trek style.","April 7, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Or if you want more modern examples, Diablo 3 and Prison Architect.  It isnt a better click-killer than the Diablo games, or a better building planner that Theme Hospital, but it does take the basics of both and mesh them into a solid and fun whole.","April 1, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a slow paced builder with simple economy and fairly repetitive missions. Yet I rather enjoy romping around with an away team and watching people visit my station. The ability to reaccomplish missions and the contract system makes it fairly easy to level a new crew up in your current ones get disgruntled enough to leave.\n\nNot for someone looking for a fast paced game.","April 1, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
