I was very, very let down.\n\nWorst part of the game, one of the "achievments" is to spend real money on orbs for the game, which seems idiotic. I'd rather just pay money for a real game. The least amount of money you can pay is a dollar, which isn't a lot, but this ENTIRE GAME isn't even worth a dollar. There are vastly superior flash games you can play for free on Kongregate. The item really worth buying in the game is 2 bucks, and seriously, this game is not worth two bucks. Also, the game is built to REQUIRE spending money in order to do well. It's just a huge grind. Pace is very very slow unless you spend money.\n\nThe game itself is incredibly simple. Only one level, and it's just waves of enemies coming at you, and you press the space bar at them. No joke. It just keeps going, and you're supposed to do this over and over and over, in hopes of unlocking more stuff, so you can press the space bar button even more times before dying.\n\nThere's also very little to the upgrade system. Every upgrade costs a LOT of in-game cash to get. There are only 3 guns, and 4 levels to each gun. You can also make your porch be able to take more hits (get more lives). Then there are three items to use in game (like freezing time). Considering how long it takes to get in-game cash, there is no way you would want to spend that much on a stupid one time use item. Very pointless system indeed.","November 15, 2014","false","2.4"," 126 of 159 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","126","159","2","0"

Besides that i can only imagine when the game process' further what damage may occour towards my keyboard.

Starts easy and chill but becomes challenging to even mindblowing insane. You know, I  read a bunch of reviews and most give a negative vibe. All for an achievement. One of the steam achievements require an ingame purchase. The lowest purchase I saw was like 0.39 € so that's not very much. I paid more for worse games.

Bland gameplay, exceedingly steep curve for weapon upgrade costs. It's very clear you're intended to spend money to make getting farther in the game feasible; the game WILL overwhelm you with impossible odds eventually, which no amount of button pressing is enough to overcome. Your weapon simply cannot fire fast enough to hurt some of the enemies, requiring you to lose, and hopefully have enough for an upgrade.\n\nThe combo scheme is one which punishes misses far more than it rewards hits.","November 16, 2014","false","0.3"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","20","30","0","0"

It was free, so I was going into it with a bit of skepticism. Right off the bat I can see, whether it is or not, it looks like a mobile port. I'm not finicky about graphics, but the menu itself was confusing. The screen was mostly empty space with icons in the corners. What do these icons do? You can't find out without trying them.\n\nVISUALS AND SOUND\nI won't dwell on this for very long, because its simply bad. Firstly your character doesn't move, he teleports between the lanes. Okay the graphics are kind of decent otherwise by free to play standards, but the sound design. The music is generic and repetetive, the guns are far too loud, and the ship sounds like the teleporter from Star Trek: TOS (that's kinda cool at first, but like the game, gets annoying).\n\nGAMEPLAY\nI'll admit I enjoyed the first half hour or so. Then it grew tedious, to the point that from then on I'd only play while listening to a podcast. There are two ways I can think to describe it. Its either Plants vs. Zombies without plants or Galaga with lanes. That's all there is to say really. There are also gun upgrades and power-ups, which are obtained by spending orbs earned by killing, but they don't seem to really do all that much.\n\nMICROTRANSACTIONS\nIf you're still with me I'll go on and say that I hate these with a passion. Especially when they can rack up to cost more than the game could possibly be sold for. You can buy the aforementioned orbs with real money. Except I don't see why you would. Even if you enjoy the game, the upgrades are basically what kept me going for as long as it did. What other motivation do you have? Well, I suppose there is one thing...\n\nACHIEVEMENTS\nThere are loads! But they're all really grindy. Now, you may be wondering what that ending of the last section was about. Well, there's a microtransaction achievement. Yeah. In order to "complete" this free game, you have to buy something in it. If you weren't already sure about whether you should or shouldn't get this, that should be enough.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nOkay maybe its not all bad. It just needs some serious polish, but it would appear the devs have cast it aside. Its free, so you might as well pick it up just to try assuming you have the spare bandwidth.","November 3, 2015","false","1.2"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

This is not multiplayer, nor a game that you need to work hard at, at all. If it was multiplayer, I'd say it was a P2W game, but it's not. So how in the world can microtransactions ruin the game if you have no competition that buys them and you don't to overpower you? Next, the amount of work needed... This game is so low key, I don't even know where to begin. You're playing an old man who's mad at aliens for being in his yard. All I can remember is the Walking Dead from this really. I like it because it's a nice change from all the big games out there these days. Not everyone will like it, true, but don't blame it on microtransactions when you don't need them or it being too difficult because you have to earn soooooo many orbs to get anything.","November 24, 2014","true","0.6"," 28 of 51 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","28","51","0","0"

It plays a lot like Galaga in that you fight waves of enemies on a checkerboard style level where you shoot projectiles (in this case a firearm) to destroy the incoming hostiles. It's set up in waves in the old arcade space shooter style, and really the light hearted old grandpa character with his muzzle loader blasting away aliens adds to the overall bright cartoon aesthetic of the game. You can also upgrade your arsenal by collecting orbs and purchasing them in the shed with new weapons like a shotgun. The enemies vary as well, as you progress through the levels, so it becomes more diverse and challenging.

So even if you have already passed that wave, you don't know what's coming! It is NOT a pay to win sort of game but that option is there. Instead of forcing you to spend money on power-ups like other games (Angry Birds,Candy Crush.) You can spend the orbs that you earn on them. Though the power-ups are very expensive aswell with upgrades. This is not the only "bad" part of the game. Gathering orbs is really a pain is the ♥♥♥. It takes FOREVER. If I had to sum up this game in one word, that word would be "Grindy" That is because the whole plot of the game is based on grinding ideas. But even though the grindy aspect of the game is a downfall, I still would recommend this game. It is a "pass the time" kind of game like PacMan!\n\nMy Rating would be 6.5/10","December 6, 2014","true","1.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Give yourself a goal in this game, and you'll have fun for hours. I would have 9.1+ hours on a boring Free To Play game.

They don't ever shoot at you, and that's very nice of them.\nThe game is listed as free, and it actually is, but you have to spend some real-life money if you want to pass some higher levels because enemies' waves get REALLY hard after level 10. I spent less than 1€ and got to upgrade all my guns to level 2, a bunch of power-ups and a level-2 defense for my house. Trust me, this game is simple but it's REALLY well-made and it's definitely worth way more than 1€.

The game does get exceedingly harder as it progresses, but all games must or else they'd be extremely easy and there would be very little, if any actual fun playing them.\n\nOne of the negative things about this game is that it is somewhat repetitive and it does also involve an absurd amount of grinding, which is one of the reasons why I think many people dislike this game, that and the fact that one of the achievements requires me to pay actual money to obtain.\n\nOne of my favourite things about this game are the small details. The aliens dance when I've been abducted, or the house falling apart the more damage it takes.

You can only compete highscores with your friendslist. If this is multiplayer to you, then I think you've been playing the wrong kind of games.\n\nThis game is a lot of fun, but sadly at this point I wish it was possible to give mixed reviews.\n\nThe progession is EXTREMELY slow in here.\nGame starts eary, around round 5 or so SOME speed gets added.\n\nAt round 8 it suddenly becomes unbearable to even keep up due to the fact it takes FOREVER to collect orbs to upgrade your stuff into better weaponry. I mean, you unlock your raygun for instance. This costs  2000 orbs. To upgrade it, it costs around 9000 orbs.\nYou earn around 600 orbs a match you play, counting you won't get past round 9 because suddenly loads of tanks you can't just take down. It's a long and tedious thing and just becomes WAY too repeatative.\n\nSure the game is fun, but at some point it becomes so tedious and boring that you just stop playing.\n\nThat or you've got to be willing to put money into the game or spam your social media for a mere +50 orbs a round.\nAnd personally, this game really is not worth the micro transactions.

If you're not that kind of person, then chances are you won't like this game.\n\nNow, with that behind me, my thoughts. Funny story, simple yet challenging gameplay and the ability to skip waves (which helps when you want a quick round of killing aliens,) three weapons with different strengths and weaknesses, and three activatables all make this a fun experience for me. While I haven't played it for that long, I still reccomend it to the one who likes jetpack joyride, etc. as explained before. At first, it's easy as sh*t, but then it gets harder and harder (as you would guess.) I died for the first time around Level 7. Tutorial is great, (as it shows you instead of telling you,) and gets right to the point.

I do wish there was a pay version if I wanted to support the developers without buying in game currency. Even with playing level 1 - Death over and over again there is some variety in the pattern of the aliens spawning. With that I do wish every 5-ish levels the scenery would change, as well as the music. It would make for something cool to look at and listen to. Overall a great game and time killer, needs a little more to be amazing without paying the premium price.","November 20, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you play lots of serious games then this may be a fantastic game you could play once in a while to take the load off because this is a more silly and funny type game that you could even invite a kid to play! Anyways, my only concern is how slow you earn orbs compared to how much items and upgrades cost but I guess that makes people wanna play more but anyways awesome and hilarious for the people who don't mind a little cartoon violence! :)","November 25, 2014","true","20.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's like Plants VS Zombies and Space Invaders married and had a child, and this game is their child. You controll Murray and you need to shoot at the aliens coming at your home using different ranged weapons: they'll teleport from their U.F.O. at the opposite side of your garden and start walking torwards the building where you are (and where you'll shoot them), if three or more of them manage to reach your house you'll get abdupted.\nThe game is pretty easy to play but REALLY hard to master, it has really a simple low-poly 3D graphic and a happy soundtrack (the aliens' and Murray's sound effects are pretty funny). It's good, it gets a bit repetitive sometimes and also REALLY HARD later in the game but I still suggest you to give it a try if you liked Plants VS Zombies or old arcade alien shooters.","February 14, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The same continuous level just with more and more enemies.\n\nThe controls for the game are quite simple. Them being “A” to go move left and “D” to move right, 1-3 to select weapons, “Q” to use shockwave (which sends all enemies back to the beginning of the lawn), “W” to use Cane time (slows down time) and Infuriate (no idea what it does other than creates a fiery circle around the player).\n\nThe options menu is terrible!! One switch for Music (on/off), one for SFX (on/off) and one for tutorials (on/off), that’s it, no sliders, nothing. And that music is just irritating, the same song over and over again.\n\nWhen I saw the shed I saw a glimmer of hope for the game, a way for the player to upgrade his/her weapons and defend their porch, but wait… “Get orbs!” No… don’t tell me, you can buy orbs with real money… Honestly, I thought we were past micro transactions in PC games (we wont talk about games like TF2).\n\nAnyway, I would say this game would be perfect for IOS, but not PC. But this is just my opinion.","November 23, 2014","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So people should not complain about a ingame store. Its more for people who "cant" wait to get all - also: even if i would just put 1$ in this game, its still worth it.

The enemies only get health upgrades, they don't shoot back at you, and you are limited to only left and right controls to fend them off. I was a cute concept with the whole "First Contact gone amuck due to first impressions", but the gameplay is pretty lackluster for the most part as all it boils down to is "move sideways, shoot until target dies". Sure, you can buy weapons and upgrades, but they do nothing to alter the gameplay aside from allowing you to survive longer.","November 24, 2014","false","0.5"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

First of all, the game has no end. The functional end of the game is round 25, and the key to getting lots of cash is maintaining a high wultiplier. You can get several thousand 'orbs' after about ten rounds so long as you honor the need for accuracy. It's a free game, one which, instead of displaying ads to compensate for the price tag, sells in game currency for those who want it. The gameplay is great, with or without the microtransactions. There are no features you have to pay for or anything (though I hear cards aren't handed out unless you buy something) so I don't know why people are so aggravated by it. The devs need their coffee!\n\nThat's not to say it doesn't give the P2W people an edge. Buying currency expediates things, but victory can still be earned rather than bought.","November 12, 2014","true","1.5"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

I then decided, I may as well download the game to at least give it a try, I mean it's free to play right?\nI was pleasantly surprised by what I had played. The gameplay is smooth, the enemies are actually quick challenging before Level 10 unlike most Tower Defense games, and the concept of the game is very amusing, especially the odd one liners the character says during the game.\nThe only real complaints I have are the graphics, the rendering of the game and the powerups. Some of the armored aliens sometimes left the armor hovering after they die, the main menu graphics are quite poor. In terms of the powerups, there could be a lot more powerups, and you should be able to access the store mid game instead of waiting for the game over.\nHowever this is a quality game, with good humour and gameplay, and is good for when you want to play a less stressfull game.\nI would give this a 7.5/10, possibly and 8 if it recieves updates in the future. I seriously reccomend this game for any Indie gamers!","November 17, 2014","true","0.5"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/260410/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","** Changed to Not Recommended - As the developers in their infinite wisdom have not implemented a method to keep track of purchases/progress when the game is uninstalled.\n\nGet Off My Lawn is a free-to-play vertical lane shooter.  Your role is to take control of a old age pensioner with a liking for guns whose home is being attacked by a UFO full of alien invaders.  The objective is to kill aliens and collect the valuable orbs they drop in order to upgrade your weapons and buy boosters to keep you alive longer.\n\nThe action takes place in the back-yard of the house on a lawn measuring 7 lanes by 7 hexes deep.  Gameplay consists of moving the character left and right across each lane while shooting the advancing aliens before they can reach and damage the house.   Your armory consists of three guns: musket, shotgun and ray gun.  Each has its own advantages and disadvantages; i.e. the ray gun shoots through all ranks of aliens in a lane but has a delayed firing time, while the shotgun shoots across three lanes but only at a shorter distance.\n\nThe action sees the aliens enter at the top of the screen and proceed downwards towards the house hoping to reach and damage it before being killed.  There are twenty levels consisting of several waves of advancing aliens.  Levels and waves increment as and when you kill all the aliens that appear in a given wave.  The challenge of killing the aliens increases in difficulty with progress made, as the aliens appear faster, in larger numbers and with higher degrees of armour, to lower your weapons effectiveness.  Furthermore there are four types of aliens: grunts, dodgers, large behemoths and tanks.  A combination of these factors provides the central challenge to weapon selection and targetting priority.  Master these and you will get further in the game.\n\nWith basic yet functional graphics and well suited accompanying audio the game relies on its fast and simplistic gameplay natureto draw you in.  It will keep you playing because of the semi-pschological need to keep acquiring orbs to get deeper into the game.  The more orbs collected the better weapons and more boosters that can be purchased.  The better weapons and more boosters the more orbs you can acquire.\n\nWeapons can be upgraded to six or more levels.  As can the home defences (or health) to keep you in the game for longer.  Boosters include three types: Slow-time to delay the aliens movement, Rage to increase player speed and Push-back to send the aliens back to the top of the screen when you are getting overwhelmed.  You can also spend some orbs to continue once your house has been destroyed.\n\nSo far.... so appealling.  Right!?  Well its free-to-play but unless you are prepared to put in alot of hours... (possibly 50 or more) it will take a very, very long time to acquire the large amount of orbs needed to complete the game.  (Some of the achievements require all upgrades to be made.)\n\nSo now you've guessed it!  This is sadly... where the microtransactions come in.  You can buy orbs from as little as 59p for 25,000 to a few million at the premium price of 13$/11£.  I havent purchased a single orb but if you want to make any reasonable level of progress you will have to buy the Orb Doubler which speeds up the rate of orb acquisition to a decent rate.  Once purchased it will be active for every game you play.  While its only costs £1/$1.50 it is probably the only purchase you will likely make if you have any intention of 100% completing the game because one of the achievements also requires a purchase using the steam wallet.\n\nOrdinarily I would not use micro-transations in a game full-stop but the Orb Doubler really makes this game worth playing. Im 90% sure that if you dont have it, progress with be so painfully slow that you will likely give up because the whole design of the games seems to be geered to you making at least one or more purchases.  (W/o it I could collect around 2-3k orbs per game.  With it I can collect 4-5k)  So while I cant blame the developers for adapting this model (it is free after all), just bear all this in mind before choosing to put any effort into playing this at all.\n\nThat said I can only really recommend the game if you understand the way the game works and that you'll likely be making at least one purchase.  Overall the game provides some brainless, casual fun if you dont mind playing and replaying many games over the next few weeks/months.  Indeed it is designed for precisely that reason and even gives you the option of starting at levels: 1, 5, 10, 15 or 20 depending on the challenge you feel like facing.  You will also get a blast from playing if you love(d) or hate(d) the teletubbies as the aliens appear like the characters from those shows.  At least in part.\n\nGet Off My Lawn is a decent game.  Nothing great.  Can be fun if you dont mind paying for the Orb Doubler (£1/$1.50ish) which on this occasion I didnt if it goes to support the developer in a small way.\n\nEDIT:  Be warned though that when you get further into the achievement you will be forced grind alot and I mean a hell of a lot as you will need to destroy a total of 6000 tanks... So far 28hrs in and only just over 10% (700ish) killed.  So at that rate... its gonna take 280hrs.   Only playing at higher waves seem to generate more tanks but sometimes you can play a whole game and not see one.","December 7, 2014","false","54.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/260410/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","** Changed to Not Recommended - As the developers in their infinite wisdom have not implemented a method to keep track of purchases/progress when the game is uninstalled.\n\nGet Off My Lawn is a free-to-play vertical lane shooter.  Your role is to take control of a old age pensioner with a liking for guns whose home is being attacked by a UFO full of alien invaders.  The objective is to kill aliens and collect the valuable orbs they drop in order to upgrade your weapons and buy boosters to keep you alive longer.\n\nThe action takes place in the back-yard of the house on a lawn measuring 7 lanes by 7 hexes deep.  Gameplay consists of moving the character left and right across each lane while shooting the advancing aliens before they can reach and damage the house.   Your armory consists of three guns: musket, shotgun and ray gun.  Each has its own advantages and disadvantages; i.e. the ray gun shoots through all ranks of aliens in a lane but has a delayed firing time, while the shotgun shoots across three lanes but only at a shorter distance.\n\nThe action sees the aliens enter at the top of the screen and proceed downwards towards the house hoping to reach and damage it before being killed.  There are twenty levels consisting of several waves of advancing aliens.  Levels and waves increment as and when you kill all the aliens that appear in a given wave.  The challenge of killing the aliens increases in difficulty with progress made, as the aliens appear faster, in larger numbers and with higher degrees of armour, to lower your weapons effectiveness.  Furthermore there are four types of aliens: grunts, dodgers, large behemoths and tanks.  A combination of these factors provides the central challenge to weapon selection and targetting priority.  Master these and you will get further in the game.\n\nWith basic yet functional graphics and well suited accompanying audio the game relies on its fast and simplistic gameplay natureto draw you in.  It will keep you playing because of the semi-pschological need to keep acquiring orbs to get deeper into the game.  The more orbs collected the better weapons and more boosters that can be purchased.  The better weapons and more boosters the more orbs you can acquire.\n\nWeapons can be upgraded to six or more levels.  As can the home defences (or health) to keep you in the game for longer.  Boosters include three types: Slow-time to delay the aliens movement, Rage to increase player speed and Push-back to send the aliens back to the top of the screen when you are getting overwhelmed.  You can also spend some orbs to continue once your house has been destroyed.\n\nSo far.... so appealling.  Right!?  Well its free-to-play but unless you are prepared to put in alot of hours... (possibly 50 or more) it will take a very, very long time to acquire the large amount of orbs needed to complete the game.  (Some of the achievements require all upgrades to be made.)\n\nSo now you've guessed it!  This is sadly... where the microtransactions come in.  You can buy orbs from as little as 59p for 25,000 to a few million at the premium price of 13$/11£.  I havent purchased a single orb but if you want to make any reasonable level of progress you will have to buy the Orb Doubler which speeds up the rate of orb acquisition to a decent rate.  Once purchased it will be active for every game you play.  While its only costs £1/$1.50 it is probably the only purchase you will likely make if you have any intention of 100% completing the game because one of the achievements also requires a purchase using the steam wallet.\n\nOrdinarily I would not use micro-transations in a game full-stop but the Orb Doubler really makes this game worth playing. Im 90% sure that if you dont have it, progress with be so painfully slow that you will likely give up because the whole design of the games seems to be geered to you making at least one or more purchases.  (W/o it I could collect around 2-3k orbs per game.  With it I can collect 4-5k)  So while I cant blame the developers for adapting this model (it is free after all), just bear all this in mind before choosing to put any effort into playing this at all.\n\nThat said I can only really recommend the game if you understand the way the game works and that you'll likely be making at least one purchase.  Overall the game provides some brainless, casual fun if you dont mind playing and replaying many games over the next few weeks/months.  Indeed it is designed for precisely that reason and even gives you the option of starting at levels: 1, 5, 10, 15 or 20 depending on the challenge you feel like facing.  You will also get a blast from playing if you love(d) or hate(d) the teletubbies as the aliens appear like the characters from those shows.  At least in part.\n\nGet Off My Lawn is a decent game.  Nothing great.  Can be fun if you dont mind paying for the Orb Doubler (£1/$1.50ish) which on this occasion I didnt if it goes to support the developer in a small way.\n\nEDIT:  Be warned though that when you get further into the achievement you will be forced grind alot and I mean a hell of a lot as you will need to destroy a total of 6000 tanks... So far 28hrs in and only just over 10% (700ish) killed.  So at that rate... its gonna take 280hrs.   Only playing at higher waves seem to generate more tanks but sometimes you can play a whole game and not see one.","December 7, 2014","false","54.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
