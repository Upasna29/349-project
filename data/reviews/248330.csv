There are many things I love about this game, but something that is worth a mention is the hugely addictive multiplayer. I have always found the community, even it's changed as I have played, a delight to talk to and play with. I massively recommend this game to honestly anyone. Please pick it up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/downhilldino/recommended/248330/","downhilldino","DownhillDino","http://steamcommunity.com/id/downhilldino/","42 products in account","An instant classic, Dino Run is one of my favorite little games. A long time player and it rarely gets old. Has enough modes and difficulty levels to give you a good thrashing when you're running from your demise. Achievements, trophies, and the like are also a great feature, they can be very hard but rewarding in the end. Speed runs are a good way to occupy yourself when you've completed campaign, and do get challenging! Unlike other games, the top level achievemments and hardest difficulty 'insane' are truly difficult. The controls are very simplistic but there's a learning curve to jumping about to keep your speed up. Customization with hats and colours help you trick out your dino. Be a spacedino! A fancy top-hatted one! Up to you! The only issue one may find is multiplayer, while great in its implementation you'll find it a bit deserted. The single player alone should more than enough justify buying this game though! Overall, a fantastic game and I highly recommend this to everyone.","December 7, 2015","true","7.1"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/D7B5/recommended/248330/","D7B5","Dan7Bip5","http://steamcommunity.com/id/D7B5/","72 products in account","One of my favourite games of all time, Dino Run DX is a retro styled racing game, in which you control a raptor trying to escape the end of the world. It contains the Challenge Gamemode, which has levels that progressively get harder, Speedrun Gamemode, where you can play through a lot of fun levels and the Planet D Gamemode, only for the best players, which contains extremely challenging levels. If you want, you can spice up things with choosing the Insane! Difficulty, which is the highest difficulty. There are also Super Eggs scattered across the levels for the player to collect, aswell as many milestones the player can achieve. You can customize your Dino, with tons of colors and hats to choose from. There's also Multiplayer, which is extremely fun. Race with other Dinos online as you level up unlocking new levels to play on Mutliplayer with an awesome community.\n\nThis game started out as a flash game, and it quickly became one of the most popular flash games of all time, the creators then created SE, which was a improved version of the game that costed money. Pixeljam Games, the creators of Dino Run decided that they want to make the game fresh, and began raising money for updates, and that's how DX was born. If you want, you can donate right now on this site: https://www.pixeljam.com/dinorun/\n\nAlso, I really recommend trying other games from Pixeljam Games. They create really great Indie games you should definitely try out.\n\nPros:\n+ Addicting Gameplay\n+ Really nice graphics\n+ 4 Difficulty Levels\n+ Awesome Multiplayer\n+ Awesome Community\n+ Developers respond to almost anything, which is really rare nowadays\n+ It's got Dinosaurs\n\nCons:\n- A little bit of bugs\n\nOverall: 10/10 This is a great game that everyone should try out.","October 4, 2015","true","16.0"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/adamhazan/recommended/248330/","adamhazan","THE_CHOSEN_ONE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/adamhazan/","42 products in account","Dino run DX is a game where you play as a little dinosaur during the apocalypse running from a giant wall of doom. You eat many things along the way such as, eggs, other little dinos and birds. You catch a ride with pterodactyls or ride giant objects or animals, and get powerups that give you a little boost. If you get destroyed from the wall of doom you lose a life sending you back to the beginning of the level, you have 3 in total. When you lose them all, you become extinct forcing you to restart from the start. There are different levels of dificulty to chose from and the game lets you customise your little dino with different hats and choices of skin colour. You can upgrade your dino after every level to increase his speed, acceleration, strength etc... Its a fun, short game and is fun for mostly younger ages, so i recomend you get a young sibling or cousing to play this as they might enjoy this a lot.\n\n\nI know, i only have 44 mins on this game... on steam.\n\nIf i am correct, this is the first video game i have ever played. As a kid, i was bored while my parents we're working, so when my dad showed me a website called miniclip with all these cool "Video games" i freaked out, hell, i was scared at the idea of a video game. So i went onto the website for the first time, and like every 5 (6? can't remember that well) year old boy, I LOVED THE DINOSAURS. So when i saw the little dino i clicked on it and played. I played this game so much as a kid and when i saw this on steam,  im not gonna lie, i almost cried.\n\nFor those of you who played this as a kid, on whatever website. Buy this game to support whoever made this and enjoy your own personal trip through memory lane.","April 15","true","0.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/248330/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Dino Run or Escape Extinction: The original Dino Run (also titled Escape Extinction) was released on the 30th April, 2008. In that time the game has been played over one hundred million times making it one of the most successful flash games ever developed.\n\nThe original is still widely available… for FREE!: Although Pixeljam promises that DX has made significant improvements over the original it’s a hard argument to justify purchasing this over playing the original flash games. There’s additional game play options, more levels and more hats in the DX version of the game. Of course, Pixeljam have taken complete advantage of what Steam can provide for players – achievements, full screen mode, Steamworks integration,\n\nBut what exactly is it? Dino Run bills itself as one of the first ever runner games. It’s certainly the first ever prehistoric runner game. The objective is to take your dino to the end of each level before the dreaded doomsday beats you to it. Once completely engulfed by doom your round is over. However, if you beat it to the end you get to continue. Of course, there are bonuses and traps along the way that will either aide you in your journey or hinder you. At the latter levels these traps can become immediately deadly. In the earlier levels they can still be deadly but you are given a little more leeway than you are later on. One of the best things about the game is that the levels are randomly generated. This avoids the pitfall that games can feel repetitive.\n\nMultiplayer: One of the major selling points for Dino Run DX is the addition of multiplayer and the level sharing feature. The latter, especially, gives the game a much needed shot in the arm and extends the potential of the game almost limitlessly. Of course, when you have a daily peak of just 8 players and an all-time peak of 74 you really need to increase that for the title to see the best that it can be.\n\nIt really boils down to the value proposition: Are you a fan of Dino Run? Then this is a no brainer for you. You’ve likely already got the game or you didn’t know that it was on Steam – in which case hopefully I’ve brought it to your attention. If you haven’t played it before then I suggest you give the free flash version a try and if you like it by all means jump into the game and purchase it off of Steam. The value is there for fans of the game.\n\nFor similar reviews and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 22","true","0.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

You only have a split-second to decide! Occasionally you may even want to back-track to discover a secret or grab a nice power-up -- but will you be quick enough to do so and still avoid extinction? There is a multitude of difficulty settings, one-off levels, weird cheat codes, and even multiplayer racing to keep the game very replayable.\n\nAlso, the music is lovely. It's retro, but in a fun and enjoyable, rather than annoying way. You can even download the soundtrack from within the game, and I enjoyed it enough to do so.\n\nI am not usually a fan of running games, but this one is unique and just plain fun enough to get a big thumbs-up for me.","October 6, 2015","true","3.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Dino Run DX is the latest game in the franchise.\n\nIn Dino Run DX you play as a dinosaur that is trying to avoid extinction. You must keep running in order to avoid the killer cloud of dust that is approaching quickly. Gameplay mostly involves continuing to run right and jump over obstacles in your way. While running you want to collect eggs and eat less fortunate creatures that are also trying to escape. These eggs and creatures are used to unlock additional content for the game.\n\nI had some fun with Dino Run DX. At first I found the game to be kind of boring but it started to grow on me. Dino Run DX will mostly appeal to people that enjoy runner games. Dino Run DX is not the type of game that I would play for long stretches of time. Despite having procedurally generated levels, the variety in gameplay rarely changes so you pretty much just keep doing the same things in different environments.\n\nIf you really enjoy runner games I think you should enjoy Dino Run DX and should consider picking it up. Otherwise I would maybe wait for a sale on the game.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy from the developer.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]","October 4, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can find secrets and achieve goals to earn DNA (exp), and at the end of a level you can increase your raptor's stats.  Those stats persist between runs, so you can keep strengthening your dino's acceleration, top speed, jumping height, and strength (to move things around) to better succeed at the levels.  You can also collect bones which count as a sort of currency, letting you buy a neat handful of unlocks such as wallpapers and the game's soundtrack.\n\nMultiplayer pits you in a race to safety against other raptors.  It plays similarly to single player, but without the stats upgrading.  Instead, you have points you can gain, levels you can increase, which let you host higher-level races which give more points.  You can also unlock hats as you go!\n\nI played this game way back in 2008 when it first came out as a humble flash game, and happily bought up the special edition when it came out in 2011. When I heard about the DX release here on Steam the other day by email I was stoked! I had no idea this was coming out! Even better, I handed the devs a receipt of my old SE purchase and I got a free key! So if you bought SE back in the day there's no reason not to email the devs and ask for a key. :3\n\nAs of this writing the game doesn't seem too different from its old SE release, but I understand that it's getting crowdfunded right now and early in the cycle. The first goal of DX was just to get it onto Steam; we'll be seeing new features and things added in in the comic months from the looks of it! I'd call it a worthy investment - and even as it is now, basically similar to the SE version, it's still as much fun now as it was back then.\n\nI've also created a Skype group for furs and furry-friendly people who want to play this game together - the multiplayer mode being quite fun, when you have people to play with! If you've got the game and are furry-friendly, then just drop me a Friend request and/or comment on Steam here asking to join. :3","October 2, 2015","true","78.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I suppose it depends on how much you played the original.  Dino Run DX, for all that "Deluxe" implies, feels like an exact port of the old flash game.  Glitches, visual bugs and all.  These are things we were happy to put up with when it was free, but to pay money for an edition that doesn't really improve on it at all is disappointing.  More notable is the failure of multiplayer- indeed, it's essentially dead now, and all the "players" you'll see there appear to be kids using it as a chatroom.  When I say dead, I mean DEAD, by the way.  I haven't played a single online game yet, and doubt I will.\n\nAnother negative thing about the game is the bizarre controls.  For some reason, your little dino doesn't control very predictably.  Jump height varies seemingly randomly, and goes off in strange directions, so leaping for tantalizingly placed eggs can be an exercise in frustration.  The result is that simply moving around isn't as fun as it should be.  To be fair, this is a problem with the original game as well, but it's a surprisingly big issue, as it cuts down on the replay value immensely for me.\n\nWhat can I say that's positive?  Well, it's cute, it's charming, it's lovely to look at.  It sounds pretty good, to boot.  The pixel art is a blend of the old and new - the pixelation and limited colors we might associate with old Atari games, but without any of the limitations, like those on sprite count or scrolling.  Dino Run is, well, a modern game in a cute pixel style, but it is important to note that as a 2007 release this game (and the studio that made it, Pixeljam) actually pioneered the style before most other indie titles.  There's a ton of hats to collect, eggs and special eggs to find, and it can be fun.  But it's hard to overlook its shortcomings when you're paying for it.\n\nLook, I'm a longtime fan of Pixeljam.  I love their art, music, and their games.  I'd like to see their games come to other platforms (Gamma Bros. on 3DS would be sweet - just sayin').  But I'm not really happy with the state of this Steam release.  I'm happy to have supported one of my favorite studios, but unfortunately this will be finding its way into my "uninterested" game folder.","March 30","false","1.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

Orr maybe it is just a dumb flash game moved to Steam for some mindess enjoyment. When you are done, your reward is more running until you die a natural death doom catches up with you. Somehow a natural death is still more preferable, trust me, you don't want the doom.\n\nJokes aside, I will offer a short practical review, and a longer more picked apart analysis.\n\nPractically, this game has a tiny community, but each match is short and since matches are managed by a host, you can start with anywhere from 2-6 players depending on interest. Often it will be just 2 or 3, as that will be the entirety of players in the lobby. No link to steam accounts, so you will have to make your own Xgen account. This is a pixel game with simple controls that anyone that can play Super Mario Bros. can pick up with ease, albeit learning what does what, while optional, is helpful in regards to the plants. The cost... well it is a browser game so play it on the Xgen website and then make up your mind whether you want to get the Steam version.\n\nOn a deeper level, I was only half-joking about my first paragraph. While I doubt that was the intended effect, the game does feel rather dark and pessimistic at times for those that care about the ambience, pessimistic in a way that reflects reality. A sense of one's very survival being so fleeting that there is no time to live, only time to fear doom. Such is adult life, and such it has been since the beginning of mankind. The music and atmousphere can be anywhere from mildly inviting to outright depressing. Of course, I doubt most players will really notice or be concerned about this part.","March 17","true","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Same engine, same experience, new stuff to play with.\n\nAlthough the "upgrading" of the internal Flash Player (ye it's FL-based) has caused automatic anti-alliasing and problems on certain machines, but I blame Adobe for that ♥♥♥♥. Hopefully they can iron out every last one of Adobe's "features" to bring back the old experience with new stuff. Sadly it's also the same fate as a lot of classic Flash games and vids. As relentless as PixelJam is, it's doubtful that these issues will remain indefinitely.\n\n"Wait, where's your actual review?"\nIf you haven't played this game I don't know what you're doing with your life. You can play the old free versions on their site, MiniClip, Kongregate, NG, etc. It is Flash-based after all.\n...\nFine. A short rundown: It's a fun game despite its somewhat unrealistic physics (but it makes for hilarious results if you can wurk it). The skills you need to beat the insane classic challenge run will make the whole of the game quite enjoable if you dig these kinds of games. It's not casual, but it's not hardcore either, which is pretty refreshing and gives it a lot of replay value, kind of like Ori and the Blind Forest. Yes, I went there.\n\nThe game's soundtrack has a subtle and proper blend of DnB, Doom Metal guitars, and Tribal elements. Not a lot to hear, but it's a small game. I hope to see it expanded in the future. Apparently the Halloween Hellrun comes with it's very-own soundtrack. Can't wait to get some files of it, too.","November 13, 2015","true","26.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It's beautiful, and the physics feel nice and sticky, like you're always fighting against boulders and other dinos. I wish there was proper controller support, though, so you could control the whole game from the controller instead of just your dinos - enabale it for the menus and such.

I liked the graphics, the music, I played it daily. Then after forgetting it existed for a few years, I stumbled upon Pixeljam's campaign to revitalise this game. Too bad Dino Run 2 failed, I guess. I honestly think this is better anyway. You can't really make a successful sequel to an endless runner without ruining it. I've had 15 hours of play in the last 2 days, so that sort of shows how much of a nerd I am. This new desktop version has an improved speedrun mode, with seeds, and there really isn't a need for cheats when you can enable and disable them on the fly in freerun mode. With good art, a nice soundtrack, and easy-to-exploit goodies links, I'm rating this game a solid 5/7.","January 29","true","29.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was called Dino Run and was a flash game (You can still play the first version of the game on sites like miniclip). The game became a kind of popular flash game. In 2010, pixeljam release a new Dino Run game called Dino Run SE. Dino Run SE added new colors, hats, and you could play it outside a browser (There was multiplayer, too). A little bit after that, pixeljam began working on Dino Run 2. There was much hype for it, but sadly it had to be cancelled because it didn't have enough funds on kickstarter.

Pixeljam recently released an update for this game. It adds a new game mode called Freerun. Freerun is basically a sandbox game mode. You can disable/enable the doom wall, spawn any dino, and spawn boulders and meteorites. Overall, I give this game a 7.5/10.

A decade later and in several years into college, it brought a smile to my face to play it once more with the fantastic soundtrack and clunky mechanics, same as before.  Bringing back old memories like that alone is well worth the cost for me.  I will say however it does convey the frantic run away from the wall of doom very well, more so than most games I've played.\n\nHowever, if you haven't played this before, there's truthfully not much going for it.  It's a simple, straightforward runner game that's probably worth the dosh below the price listed currently.  Still, you can tell the game has a lot of heart.  The cute animations, the simplistic yet effective mechanics, and in my opinion, a pretty amazing soundtrack despite how small it is.  It was original and punchy.
