It does a good job of keeping with the beat of the songs and I am really getting into the songs. This game will likely keep me entertained for many more hours, and is worth the price to me in spite of its flaws.\n\nThere is certainly a wide list of what could be improved with it however, so I really really hope the devs are still working on it.\n\nMy biggest complaint would be to have the orbs to come in at a much shallower angle. After playing 2-3 songs where I'm looking up most of the time, my neck really starts to get sore. To make up for the reduced angle of attack from above, I would recommend also allowing orbs to come from below the horizon as well (this obviously means you will have to remove the floor from in front of you)\n\nI would also like some colorblind support, as I can barely tell the difference between the blue and the purple (at the very least, make the purple much darker so there is more contrast between the two colors.\n\nIt is also a bit buggy. Opening the keyboard will sometimes mess with and disable the pointer on the controllers and you can no longer point and "click" on anything in game or in the steam overlay menu until you completely reboot the VR.\nIt also sometimes crashes but no so much as to ruin the experience (only twice in the six hours I played, but that is still two more than any other VR titles I've played).\n\nI really appreciate the option of adding a guest name for score keeping, but I do wish that it would not overwrite the high score of the main steam account if the guest's score is higher. But at least there is a solution by having every user use a guest name.\n\nLastly, I would like for there to be even harder difficulties. While the "Harder" difficulty can still be challenging and fun, I want there to be a difficulty where I actually have to struggle to get over 90%. Perhaps implement some actual roomscale functionality by having us actually have to move our feet to dash left and right to hit out of reach orbs.","April 25","true","7.1"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/angrytigerp/recommended/412740/","angrytigerp","Angrytiger [USN IRL]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/angrytigerp/","738 products in account","My relationship with Audioshield is very much of the love/hate variety.\nThe game is prone to crashes, has a painfully broken user interface, and is rife with bugs and glitches that may put off the most intensely competitive gamers. That said, it is my most-played VR title so far, and I find myself returning to it again and again for more physical fun.\n\nThe basic premise is that blue and orange orbs, synced* (*to some extent -- see Bad-3 below) to any music you insert into the program, come flying towards you in the virtual world. You use your two Vive controllers to fend off these orbs; the controllers correspond to shields of the same color in your left and right hands, respectively. On some occasions, a purple 'composite' orb will appear, and you have to combine your two shields into one by putting them together physically or pulling both controllers' triggers.\n\nScores are awarded for number of notes hit ("Technical" score) and amount of physical activity done during the song ("Artistic" score). Global leaderboards are already filling up with people getting ~9.9X Technical scores (hit 99.X% of notes in the song), with Artistic score serving as the tiebreaker.\n\nThe Good:The fact that you can plug in virtually any song of any genre you want is spectacular. Like its cousins Audiosurfs 1 and 2 (made by the same developer, no less), Audioshield uses a beatmapping algorithm to make 'stages' based entirely on the tempo and sound of the song you choose. If you want an intense, high-speed experience, play a high-tempo EDM song; if you want to just chill out, put on some alt rock or country or something like that.\nLimited Soundcloud integration means that you can often find music to play even if your own library is sparse. The system is currently somewhat broken, though, as only a small selection of songs from Soundcloud are available compared to if you searched for them through a browser.\nThere's a decent, if not terribly amazing, variety in the ways to play. Three different shield shapes means three different techniques to learn/use (or pick one that is your favorite and stick with it). Three different difficulty levels (Normal, Hard, and Harder in ascending order of difficulty) provide different levels of orb generation and complexity (amount of "crossover" notes requiring you to reach a blue orb on the right side of the play area, for example).The Bad:The UI is completely broken. There's no SteamVR integration, meaning that you can't pull up the keyboard in game like with other VR games; this means that to look up Soundcloud titles, or leave a message under your scoreboard entry (if any), you need to return to your computer's traditional keyboard. And then, even once you're at your computer, you have to deal with a finicky cursor that doesn't really seem to click on what it's actually pointed at.\nUsing songs from Soundcloud is easy enough, but the game has an odd tendency to crash every so often (every other song or so, and that's not even exaggeration) when doing so. I'm guessing this has something to do with downloading the track.\nThe algorithm for beatmapping is slightly better than Audiosurf 2's, but in the end it is still an imperfect product. Unless you use songs with strong, definitive beats, it's hard to get a track where you feel like you're moving with the song the whole time. And then, the only way to get this feeling is to play on the hardest difficulty setting (Harder).\nThe skill ceiling is easily reached, and while some users have created mods to make tracks even more aggressive, I would argue that they are an imperfect solution to what would be better solved with better beatmapping.\nCrashes and instability in general. I don't think I've ever played a game that crashed so often for so long. It'll sometimes crash when restarting a song partway through; it'll sometimes crash when starting a song in the first place. It'll sometimes crash on startup. Of my ~20 hours of playtime as of this review (25 recorded, but I've left the program running while rendering videos), I would estimate about an hour of that total was spent having to go back to my computer and stop the Audioshield process and restart it. That may seem like a small amount of instability, but you can really feel it when you're trying to just play a song (or keep replaying a song for points) and the game spontaneously decides it has no interest in continuing to work anymore.\nScore and points are relatively meaningless. There's no point-tracking in-song, there's no 'perfect hits' where you hit notes JUST when they should be hit, etc., any of the things usually associated with rhythm/music games. Leaderboard battles mainly end up as struggles to edge out people by .1% of a technical score, and if a song's top players are all 10.0s, you have to struggle to get a higher artistic score.\nAlso, artistic score is a very vague and poorly-defined/tracked metric. Apparently it can be gamed by waving the remotes around very aggressively whenever you get a 'break' in the song, or at the end of the song.\nYet despite all that... it's a lot of fun. There's a visceral joy in combining grooving to music with a game-type scoring system (even one as barebones as this). It's also an unquestionably physical experience, especially when you use high-powered music that requires a lot of movement (see my YouTube video at the end of this for an idea of what I mean by mentioning the physicality). Despite its flaws, if you enjoy music, or enjoy rhythm games with lots of movement (Just Dance in the modern age, DDR and its ilk a decade ago), this is a perfect fit for your $800 toy.\n\nHere is the video I mentioned.","May 17","true","26.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

First, the incoming balls don't really sync up with the audio beats that well.   There is some synchonization with the pace of the song.   Where the song slows down, so do the balls and vice versa when it picks up.   However, I expected it to be better with all of the positive reviews.   Second, it needs a better way to select music from the local drives.    The local music selection is done through a file picker when it really needs to be a music browser like winamp or itunes where you can browse by different criteria.    It takes a lot of time to go through a large music collection to find the song you want.   Luckily it keeps a shortcut of the last folder you were in but you have to start at the beginning of the file list if you want a new folder.

In fact it registers more hits when I just stand there and wait for the blobs to hit the shields..\nCombined with a couple crashes this is not fun for anyone looking for a beat matched rhythm game.\n\nIt's a decent casual game once they fix at least the collision detection and crashes.","May 26","false","1.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I have played a lot of Guitar Hero and Audiosurf back in the day so getting Audioshield for my Vive seemed like a no brainer. I was wrong.\n\nThe game is very unstable. Apparently when you move the move the window, it crashes. A lot of the time the game crashes after a song is completed. Even when the game is working fine there is still a error window popping up. Not like that really matters, but it's just very sloppy.\n\nJust like the main menu. Unlike the SteamVR overlay where you have to drag (by holding the trigger) up to go down, you aim the cursor the cursor and the menu immediately scrolls. Not a big issue, but again, just sloppy.\n\nThen you have the game itself. The beats that you have to punch are not very consistent, meaning that even though you are hearing the same part in a song itself, it still plays diffrently. A lot of the time the beats do not sync in the slightest. Then, futher down a song you have to look at a very weird angle to block the beats. Why? Why can't i just look in front of me for the intirety of the song? It hurts my neck after a while.\n\nAll these issues combined makes the €20 pricetag too hefty.

However, what Audioshield offers is magical. I've found myself playing it every day in order to transform myself into the world of music that I'm normally only able to experience with my ears. With Audioshield, I'm thrown into the music and can feel it, and see it.\n\nNot only is Audioshield great exercise, but it's very recommendable to a wide audience. Out of all the games I currently own for HTC Vive, it's certainly one of the three best to demo to friends and family.\n\nIt helps that I can use my own local music. That said, the Soundcloud based streaming provides some great options to diversify the offerings and make the experience less reliant on collecting a library of songs.\n\nAudioshield isn't perfect, though. The bubbles are inconsistent, resulting in some songs providing far less compelling experienes than others.. I will say that you will get the most out of this game if you enjoy electronic music. Although rock, progressive, pop, and other genres work within Audioshield, they tend not to provide as exciting and dynamic of rhythm for the gameplay.\n\nAdditionally, the gameplay is limited to two stages and three types of shield. Therefore, as with other HTC Vive games, there's plenty of redundancy here, but it's still the most replayable room-scale experience that I've played.\n\nOut of the entire HTC Vive launch line-up, I would rate this as one of the three best options.","May 3","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each motion control is a different color shield, as you frantically or "artistically" match them with the corresponding colored bubbles flying at you. The faster the song, the faster the bubble velocity. The harder the difficulty, the better it syncs up to the chosen song, although do not expect the algorithm to be perfect, it's very much like Audiosurf and does not sync well with every single song. Global, local and friendly leaderboards keep track of who's the best at the game for each song, assuming they're not constantly pausing the game. Either way, it is loads of fun within the HTC Vive and probably currently one of the best virtual reality games available on the market. Equipped with a few graphical options and a couple different environments, this extremely immersive and fun, and a bit psychedelic game will give you a work out. That is, if you have more music in your library than slow, sad songs.

The game has no music of its own, and instead generates note charts from your mp3s. Most of the time these charts end up being garbage, and you'd be better off just playing a game like Space Pirate Trainer with music in the background, but every now and then a song works really well and that's when this game shines. The problem is that the game is very buggy, and in the hour I played I ended up halfway through the floor twice, SteamVR crashed 3 times, my SteamVR desktop view was broken until I restarted SteamVR twice, and the game crashed every time I tried to close it, which I had to at one point when I chose the wrong song and the End Song button didn't respond to anything. Audioshield has potential, but right now it's so buggy that I'm considering refunding it and waiting to see if it gets patched. Until it does, it's hard to recommend it when it's already enough of a challenge finding songs that work well.","April 30","false","0.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Aside from Bugs and crashes (the 720p-beta branch helped me avoid those at least).\n\nThe idea is great, but somehow it just isn't as fun as I expected.\nYou can choose your own songs, which sounds great, but actually isn't, because the speed of the bubbles seems to depend the frequency of bass.\nIf it's a quick song with only a few low bass notes, it feels extremely weird, because the bubbles actually stop moving for a second until the bass hits again. At first I thought that it just wasn't running smoothly, but I testet it with different songs and there is definitely a connection.\n\nI expected the general speed of the song to determine the speed of the bubbles and the heigth of the notes influence the position of the bubbles which would feel a lot more intuitive, I think.\n\nAll in all, I feel it's not actually worth 20 bucks.

I understand why people like it, but the randomness really irks me. I want to get into a pattern with the music (like you do when making music) but your constantly forced out of the song and adapt it it's chaotic randomness on what it thinks you should be doing.\n\nId really like to see a version of this game where, like Osu!, players can choreograph the songs more intelegently and share their files.\n\nAlso the lack of sound in the game is perplexing. There's not music in the menus, just dead silence, and I'd expect some kind of audio feedback for hitting the orbs (which would be adjustable).

That was the game I chose to start with. About the time I started on my 2nd song, I had completely realized that the 1,000 dollar price tag (int. shipping) was completely worth the price. Every cent of the price tag of my VR admission ticket was weeeeeeeeeeell worth it.\n\nThis game is constantly replayable and worth the price, right up there with any other big VR title. Holy christ the menu for song selection is incredibly well made, the early day 1 song selection was fantastic. The gameplay is astounding, I am currently on cloud nine after popping my VR cherry just now but wow though this game is still brilliant. It's so insanely immersive once I took off my HMD I had no idea where I was for a moment, this game totally took me out of rl.

I would say 5% of the orbs you hit are actually on any sort of beat. You don't even need headphones in to get a near-perfect score. It really starts to feel mindless after a while when you realize all you are doing is punching orbs.\n\nThey should make the featured songs have hand-crafted rythm and not rely on the alogarithm. They should also make it so if you miss an orb it messes up the song for a brief moment. Give me a reason to give as ♥♥♥♥ that I am hitting these stupid things.\n\nAlso, visually I would say it is the blurriest of all the Vive titles and nothing I do gets rid of the god rays and screendoor effect.\n\n","May 11","true","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Man oh man was I wrong. This game puts you in a really cool stage environment your left hand wields a blue shield and your right hand wields a red shield (looks more orange to me). If you put your shields together or pull one of the triggers on the controller, you create a purple shield. Your goal is to block the blue, red, and purple orbs that are coming at you, to the beat of the music, with the according color shield. The game is simple but extremely fun and while not perfect the orbs match the beat of the song extremely well.\n\nPros:\nCan import any mp3 on your computer.\nVisuals, especially the particle effects flying around your shield, are really fun and good looking.\nSimple, anyone can pick this up making it a great party game. It was easy swap headsets between songs to let everyone try it.\nCons:\nNot a lot of included songs with the game it really doesn’t shine unless you import your own. The included songs have a lot of variety and are really good though.\nUI is a little weird, I think the difficulty is supposed to be normal, hard, harder but often times I would see the same option twice i.e. Normal, harder, harder.\nEasy, with only three notes (purples are hardly used) it is hard to miss a lot of notes. As far as I know of you can’t fail out of a song like you can in Guitar Hero for missing too many notes. When I would give the headset to someone new they had no trouble playing it on harder without any previous experience with it.\nTLDR:\nFantastic game, buy it. I really didn’t think I would enjoy it as much as I did. It was the favorite at my launch day party and we ended up sinking the most time in to this game. This is a game that I could go back to over and over. The game was a little on the easy side (making it perfect for a party) but other than that I had no issues with the game and in my opinion is a must play.","April 6","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When you miss, the screen gets a bit fuzzy to let you know you missed one, but otherwise the song keeps moving along.  Song selection is fast and readily available on soundcloud with zero effort on your part.  You can of course use your own music library or go find something which I no doubt will.  This will be a top demo when I share with others.\n\nCriticism - really nothing bad, but there are things I want more from the game.  The audience watching the VIP stage doesn't cheer or anything.  So a song ends and you are excited, but then it's silence - feels a bit of a let down.  I want more environments or unlockables, or something.  Right now there is plenty of replayability to play along with songs, but there is no further depth, or sense of progress.  Play and enjoy.\n\nIf you are on the fence - go for it... totally worth every penny!","April 7","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is what you get when you apply that to virtual reality. The core gameplay comes down to picking out songs on your local machine or available on Soundcloud and surviving the resulting barrage of blue and orange balls which represent your music in the virtual space.  Audioshield is focused on this mechanic alone with laser precision, and completely nails the execution. To this point, I have not had any desynchronization between my controllers and the shields in the game - every note I miss is my fault.\n\nI didn't get sucked in to Audiosurf, though I did enjoy it. However the sense of presence that it's successor gains from being in virtual reality does a great job selling the experience. It's easy to get in to the rhythm and the music and bring some artistic flair to your one-man shield wall. In fact, more active performances from the players are gauged higher than passive renditions. To keep up on the leaderboards as they shake out in this game, I suspect that maintaining an active playstyle will be crucial towards maintaining top spots on popular songs.\n\nWhat comes hand-in-hand with this Audioshield experience is a break from the sedentary lifestyle from those of us that need it. If you need to trick yourself in to staying a little more active in your day-to-day, it's not hard to work up a sweat in this game and the feedback from the experience will keep you to the routine if you let it.\n\nTo answer a question that has come up a lot on reddit and other places, there is no Spotify integration for this game due to the encrypted nature of offline songs from that service. Similarly, Microsoft Groove songs will show up in your list of playable songs with all the proper metadata however no music makes it to the level when you select it.\n\nI can recommend this game without reservation as an excellent choice for brand new VR libraries if you've got a thing for rhythm games and aren't afraid of sweating.

Man oh man was I wrong. This game puts you in a really cool stage environment your left hand wields a blue shield and your right hand wields a red shield (looks more orange to me). If you put your shields together or pull one of the triggers on the controller, you create a purple shield. Your goal is to block the blue, red, and purple orbs that are coming at you, to the beat of the music, with the according color shield. The game is simple but extremely fun and while not perfect the orbs match the beat of the song extremely well.\n\nPros:\nCan import any mp3 on your computer.\nVisuals, especially the particle effects flying around your shield, are really fun and good looking.\nSimple, anyone can pick this up making it a great party game. It was easy swap headsets between songs to let everyone try it.\nCons:\nNot a lot of included songs with the game it really doesn’t shine unless you import your own. The included songs have a lot of variety and are really good though.\nUI is a little weird, I think the difficulty is supposed to be normal, hard, harder but often times I would see the same option twice i.e. Normal, harder, harder.\nEasy, with only three notes (purples are hardly used) it is hard to miss a lot of notes. As far as I know of you can’t fail out of a song like you can in Guitar Hero for missing too many notes. When I would give the headset to someone new they had no trouble playing it on harder without any previous experience with it.\nTLDR:\nFantastic game, buy it. I really didn’t think I would enjoy it as much as I did. It was the favorite at my launch day party and we ended up sinking the most time in to this game. This is a game that I could go back to over and over. The game was a little on the easy side (making it perfect for a party) but other than that I had no issues with the game and in my opinion is a must play.","April 6","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoyed any of the Audiosurf games then this is kind of similar, with procedural generation of levels. It's simplistic in a good way; Audiosurf tended to overcomplicate the game with all sorts of gamemodes when almost everyone played the game in mono mode. The core gameplay is simplistic in the way mono mode in Audiosurf is. But it is also challenging, even moreso than Audiosurf. It has that same arcade high score focus but the basic gameplay is overall much more fun because it encourages you to move to the music. It's designed from the ground up for VR and it obviously shows.\n\nIt's an extremely comfortable game for VR and I can't imagine anyone getting sick from this. It can also be played in a very small space as you stay in a single position.\n\nIt's not a perfect game and I feel like it still needs some polish, specifically in the menus and in the curation of tracks. Personally I don't have any audio tracks on local storage as I stream everything from Spotify and have done so for some time, and I suspect many people are the same. There is Soundcloud integration but for it to really elevate the game there should be some Soundcloud playlists on offer. It could be as simple as pulling data from the trending and most popular tracks on there. That would keep it fresh, offer 'new' content weekly with little further input from the developer once implemented and prevent the 'most popular' Audioshield list from ending up stagnant. I hope the developer does implement something like this as in its current state it feels unfinished and is the only part that isn't polished unlike the core gameplay.","April 7","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It doesn't play out as you would expect.  This is not a Rock Band type clone.  Your actions do not effect the music.  There's just a song that plays and you block these colored orbs that shoot out according to the tempo of the song.  The point is to block as many in a row as you can.  If you fail it doesn't actually do anything.  Something like this should either be free or no more than a couple bucks.  Especially when the two possible stages look like garbage.  Maybe it'll get better.  Doesn't seem like it though.  There hasn't been many changes since release.","May 24","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoyed any of the Audiosurf games then this is kind of similar, with procedural generation of levels. It's simplistic in a good way; Audiosurf tended to overcomplicate the game with all sorts of gamemodes when almost everyone played the game in mono mode. The core gameplay is simplistic in the way mono mode in Audiosurf is. But it is also challenging, even moreso than Audiosurf. It has that same arcade high score focus but the basic gameplay is overall much more fun because it encourages you to move to the music. It's designed from the ground up for VR and it obviously shows.\n\nIt's an extremely comfortable game for VR and I can't imagine anyone getting sick from this. It can also be played in a very small space as you stay in a single position.\n\nIt's not a perfect game and I feel like it still needs some polish, specifically in the menus and in the curation of tracks. Personally I don't have any audio tracks on local storage as I stream everything from Spotify and have done so for some time, and I suspect many people are the same. There is Soundcloud integration but for it to really elevate the game there should be some Soundcloud playlists on offer. It could be as simple as pulling data from the trending and most popular tracks on there. That would keep it fresh, offer 'new' content weekly with little further input from the developer once implemented and prevent the 'most popular' Audioshield list from ending up stagnant. I hope the developer does implement something like this as in its current state it feels unfinished and is the only part that isn't polished unlike the core gameplay.","April 7","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The video is neat, but really doesn't convey what the game feels like.  You get feedback with every blob hit, so they feel substantial.  When you miss, the screen gets a bit fuzzy to let you know you missed one, but otherwise the song keeps moving along.  Song selection is fast and readily available on soundcloud with zero effort on your part.  You can of course use your own music library or go find something which I no doubt will.  This will be a top demo when I share with others.\n\nCriticism - really nothing bad, but there are things I want more from the game.  The audience watching the VIP stage doesn't cheer or anything.  So a song ends and you are excited, but then it's silence - feels a bit of a let down.  I want more environments or unlockables, or something.  Right now there is plenty of replayability to play along with songs, but there is no further depth, or sense of progress.  Play and enjoy.\n\nIf you are on the fence - go for it... totally worth every penny!","April 7","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
