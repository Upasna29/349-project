"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kony4/recommended/2910/","kony4","kony","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kony4/","707 products in account","Entertaining and realistic naval warfare simulator where the player acts as a commander of a whole fleet, which includes various ships (transporters, aircraft carriers, battleships), submarines, planes (fighters, bombers, scouting) and helicopters, along with all their instruments. That includes many different radars, missiles and torpedoes. The scenarios allow for creativity and tactics, as in most missions you are given the fleet to command, but how you use it is up to you. Usually the success depends on all units and instruments working together, but as even single missions are somewhat randomized (the same mission plays differently when playing second time because enemy units spawn in different locations and in different quantities etc.) and require adjusting tactics or adapting new ones. Did you use bombers in this mission and replay it? Now you might get surprised the AI has much more powerful air force, but perhaps at the cost of submarines? Moreover the game has a huge amount of vehicles and weaponry from various countries, South and Northern American, European, Middle Eastern and Asian. Missions also happen on different places of the world with many different sides. One time you sink Brazilians as Argentinians, the other you sink Chinese as Taiwanese, and so on (though it seems everybody speaks English). You can also choose single missions of different difficulty, beginning with the easiest and slowly getting into more and more challenging ones as a great way to learn the game and form tactics. This is probably the best and the most fun naval combat game I've ever played. In addition, if you are new to the genre, you can set to automatic many settings, which will make a bit more similar to more popular RTS genre and get you accustomed to use of various radars, weapons and vehicles.\n\n10/10 (Awaiting my doritos!)\n\nPS. install nGlide to get rid of menu flickering on modern hardware.","August 24, 2014","true","8.5"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","33","36","0","0"

However, some scenarios will have you playing for hours in normal time as you desperately try to intercept all Granit "Shipwreck" missiles before they cripple your battlegroup. There really hasn't been an accessible and polished game since to replace this.\n\nMost systems have simplified characteristics; the game's primary focus appears to revolve around carrier operations and the Aegis combat system partnered with the SM-2 missile. Oh, the SM-2. What a wonderful bit of kit. Kills planes, missiles, even ships. A pathetic little gunboat is shooting down all your Harpoons? No problem, send an SM-2 to do the job. All your Tomahawk anti-ship missiles going for the oil tanker next to the ♥♥♥♥ing huge Russian battlegroup? No problem! Semi-active radar homing means no more missiles straying off course and killing neutrals. More than one missile coming at you? No problem! The long range and SPY-1 lets you shoot at multiple targets simultaneously.\n\nGraphics are very dated, it is an old game, but as you spend most of the time looking at tracks on a map, it doesn't really matter. There are graphical issues nowadays, which can be mostly solved by installing a 3Dfx Voodoo glide wrapper such as nGlide.","September 16, 2014","true","53.9"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","17","18","4","0"

Or what this game should be. I have been trying to find a pseudo-simulator for grand scale battles in naval warfare, and this is it. Sadly, I can't recommend it for anyone. Too many things don't work well. It's hard to get working. It's no longer supported by the developer. And even once you get it working, little things break in gameplay that make it hard to enjoy. At some point, subs broke completely; now they go on autopilot and refuse to engage or come to the surface (yes, I'm aware of the setting that supposedly fixes this; it doesn't work for me). Missiles disappear on launch from destroyers or cruisers. Airplanes disappear on launch from carriers. It makes play kinda worthless.\n\nGameplay wise, you're a fleet commander and you have to tell everyone what to do. Literally you have to command a combat plane in the middle of a battle to take the mach 1.4 contact that's headed straight towards him. I'm pretty sure a combat pilot wouldn't be waiting for orders from HQ. Ditto subs: they do nothing even at close contacts. Planes avoid missiles only when they get super close, and you can set it so ships self defend (again, only when missiles close to within certain death distance). The level of micro-management necessary is far beyond what a...fleet commander would have to do.\n\nIt's also irritating that certain obvious non-moveable targets (enemy airports) are unidentified, and you have to get within range of SAMs to identify them. Enemy ships and planes can ID and shoot you from afar, but you have to close to within visual to ID them. You learn quickly to preemptively shoot at anything moving above mach 0.5. Shouldn't I be able to tell the nature of these enemies from their radar emissions? And forget about cruise missile strikes on those airports once you've figured out where they are. For some reason, SAMs have no problem seeing and killing them, even if you launch 50 at one airport none will land. Jam the SAM sites, kill all nearby planes and literally a plane will lift off, kill all your missiles and flip you the bird before you can do anything.  It's just too hard to kill land targets to be realistic. You run out of ammo instead.\n\nA lot of the scenarios are interesting, but many of them fall into the 'gotcha' category: "you're a US carrier fleet, you have no early warning or combat planes in the air, and there are unidentified enemies within 10 miles of you (really, how exactly did I get in this position?). But they apparently know who you are because suddenly there are 200 missiles headed your way! Personally, more interesting to me is the feint, maneuver, initial contact and jabs of the conflict than struggling to defend (yes, you have to tell individual ships to shoot down every one of those missiles in real time unless you want them to get too close to defend properly).\n\nTL;DR: the seed of a great game for those interested in the subject. Lot of little bugs and issues make it tedious and irritating that will never, unfortunately, be fixed.","June 29, 2014","false","147.1"," 37 of 60 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","37","60","4","3"

The addition of the Naval Warfare Project mod improves the game dramatically.\n\nI wish it had faster time compression and a more accurate detection system. The ranges at which enemies are detected and indentified do not feel very believable, and the time compression feels too slow, especially if you're playing with no aircraft.\n\nAt the time of this review, the game is $5, and you get 2 other good naval sims along with it ('688(I) Hunter Killer' and 'Sub Command'). Or you can pay a bit more and get Dangerous Waters too!\n\nI highly recommend Fleet Command, but note that you may have some issues with modern graphics hardware.","March 17, 2014","true","10.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

While support for the game has dried up, it still remains the last great theater-level realistic Naval Sim. Since it doesn't look like anybody will make any game like this again, this is the game to get if you've ever thought of being an Admiral. This isn’t a game where you collect resources and generate units, instead you play out missions designed to simulate real world situations. You’re tasked with using what you’re given to solve the mission. This ranges from Destroyers, Aircraft Carriers, and Land Based planes and missiles to solve the mission.  While the game was made in the late 90s and the content reflects that, at the time it featured an accurate collection of most of the world’s naval forces for simulation. There have been mods created to bring it up to date, (Most notably The Naval Warfare Project, or NWP), which I highly recommend finding because they add tons of additional depth.\n\nOne major criticism of the game is that it is too realistic at times. The game takes place in real time, meaning that one minute in game universe equals one minute in our time. With ships moving at 20 knots, that means for ships to move from one side of the map to the other it can take many hours of play for that to happen. The game does have a “speed up time” feature, but it doesn’t go anywhere near fast enough to make casual play of the missions possible. Expect to dedicate about 12-20 hours to some of the built in missions.  But there isn’t any newer game like this for die hard Naval Sim fans out there.\n\n","June 27, 2014","true","17.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This was the case when I decided to play the ingeniously titled, Fleet Command. Maybe it should be Naval Fleet Command instead – a fleet could be anything taxis, garbage trucks or bible wielding salesman. I was all set for making fun of seamen and all the funny jokes that could be made of man on man naval warfare in the harsh waves of Fleet Command but it looks like my skipper is drunk at sea with his mistress Kiki.\n\nThis is another one of those games that gets included in a grab bag of games for maybe a nickel a piece on Steam sales. Well they cost more than that but you get the point. Going into this game I knew nothing about it, other than I had not played in before. I feel as a reviewer I should give a detailed history of my gaming preferences, my age, blood type and warm urine sample to fulfill some unwritten rule about reviewing games instead of just rambling on about it. But screw that, and not in a bunkmate kind of way. This game is so boring!\n\nI was thinking of what could be considered great about this game but I can’t think of anything. Good promotion for the Navy? Nope. Amazing ship tactics? Nope. Intuitive gameplay that any player can pick up and play? No. Graphics from 1996? Yes. Enough material to make gay Navy jokes? Not really, but I’m up for a good challenge. Hey since it has graphics as old as 1996 I can say gay and not ghay or homosexual jokes. Take that Ellen!\n\nAs you can see I’ve played roughly 30 minutes of this game thus far. And I admit 10 minutes of that was used making a grilled cheese sandwich. I was impressed with my cooking skills, yet I feel I put too much butter on the flip side. Once again that could be fuel for an awesome homophobic joke inspired by this game! Yet its so bad I don’t feel like laying down the pipe jokes. The game bores me to death. I did not bother reading the direction and messed around in a single mission then tried the tutorial till it broke. I guess I clicked on something wrong or at the wrong time then got completely lost at sea, pun intended.\n\nThe interface is so off-putting, it’s not clear what you are to do. Like how to return movies to a RedBox. On the surface it looks like it’s complicated but from what I have found it’s just a point and click naval strategy game. With a loose focus on the strategy part of said strategy game. To the developers the word strategy might simply mean – the player picks what things to do – so anything can be a strategy game?  If you see a ship coming at you click on yours, if you can spot them, then click on the bad guy to kill them. No strategy, no aligning your ships in different patterns or squads. I’m sure there is some official term for that. I’m in charge! You go there buddy and you like it! Ugh, its draining to my energy level as a Human being.\n\nMaybe I’m missing the point of this game, and I admit need to give it more time. But 30 minutes into a game you should make you feel compelled to continue on. I’ve spent more time with a Flash game and gotten much more enjoyment out of it than this. And I really wanted to make fun of close-quartered men out at sea! There really is a lack of polish that makes me feel like the game is not done or fleshed-out as other reviewers say. So this zombie skeleton of a game might have passed in 1996 but it came out it 1999 and seems even older playing it in 2014. Its funny that the Jane’s title of the game is removed for the Steam released. Is this some legal matter or are the people from Jane’s so embarrassed about the game?\n\nJust read the copy on the steam page and tell me you can’t think of at least 42 rated R jokes! “International waterways become theaters of war when the world's most formidable maritime powers exchange their fatal blows.”\n\nI was hoping for a game like Silent Service on the NES. At least something somewhat tactical, I don’t know if it’s in this game but from my short stent with it I’m bored to death. Are sea battles this boring? Why do subs come out of nowhere and kill me, how do I detect them? Why can I launch 3052 aircraft and not be able to tell each one apart.\n\nRemember the old EA marketing BS asking gamers Can a Computer Make You Cry? Yes EA, yes it can if you play this game. I don’t like destroying things but I wish I had a physical copy of this so I could put it into my blender and bury the remaining pieces at sea. Well since I don’t live near a sea the toilet would have to do! Although m luck the shattered pieces of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game would black log my toilet then flood my house and I would be unable to make grilled cheese again! Or you know, live there.\n\nIf I decide to give the game another chance I will post an update. And remember gamers if your rudder gets jammed with a torpedo think butter, pure gold butter!\n\nPros:\n-	Has the potential for many seaman jokes if you know what I mean\n-	Possibility of actual game depth if you learn how to play\n-	I can run it with max settings and I’m sure your phone can too\n\nCons:\n-	No In The Navy Song\n-	What am I supposed to do?\n-	Dated graphics and interface.\n\nMy Favorite Aspect\n\nI don’t have a favorite aspect of this game yet. I want to have one, like a girlfriend but the search continues on. S.O.S.\n\nMy Least Favorite Aspect\n\nIf I say anything bad about this game nerds will pelt me with Funyuns. If I say anything bad about the Navy people from the Air Force will laugh.\n\nDa Marketing Gimmick of Da Game!\n\nAbout the Game\nInternational waterways become theaters of war when the world's most formidable maritime powers exchange their fatal blows. With entire fleets at your command, you must strategically deploy vessels from every class - frigate to aircraft to nuclear submarine - to maintain the precarious balance of naval power and gain position for the deadly endgame. ( A COMEDIAN’S DREAM!)\n\n	Campaigns and mission scenarios straight from current headlines (LIKE A NEWS MEDIA MADE UP “TERRORIST-THREAT” AT THE OLYMPICS?)\n\n	Exclusive real-time strategy with cuttingedge (SPELLED WRONG HAHAHA), real-world weapons\n\n	Intuitive point and click game play (INTUITIVE HAHAHA COMEDY GOLD!)\n\n	No need to memorize symbols or complex commands (EVEN A 1ST GRADER CAN KILL!)\n\n	Player designed task forces (UMMM SURE)\n\n	Complete 3D environment rotates and zooms for intense combat action (INTENSE IS USED LOOSLY HERE)\n\n	Effects modeled in stunning detail- time of day, clouds, rain, differing sea states, ship's wake and pyrotechnics (IS VOMIT MODELED IN 3D AS WELL?)\n\nThe gimmick of this game is that you can control powerful forces to destroy the enemy as if you are really a commander of a fleet. I would think running a whole naval operation would be just a bit more complicated then pointing and clicking at a map. You could do that from your basement while eating pretzels then write a review about …..I’m sure being a naval commander is stressful stuff and nowhere as simple as this game. Plus I’m sure the game would be a lot more fun if you were wearing a cool hat. Most things are better while wearing hats!\n\nSo I felt like I’m doing a service to gamers around the world, for humor, for fun and to avoid grabbing weird generic sounding games in a Steam Sale.\n\nIf you have not figured it out from reading this is a work of fiction for fun only. So if you don’t have a sense of humor, get one. Names, characters, places and incidents either are products of the author’s imagination or are used fictitiously. Any resemblance to actual events or locales or persons, living or dead, is entirely coincidental so bite me!","February 10, 2014","false","0.4"," 4 of 30 people (13%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","13","4","30","4","0"
