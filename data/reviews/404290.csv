Let's start with the controls, there are options when you start the game to change your steering, obvious right?  Of course.... They were set to S and F...  Looking further, there were no accelerate and brake controls, only fly height + and fly height - options which were set to E and D.  My hopes that this would be a well made megarace-like experience were quietly taken behind the barn and shot.  Despite this, I pressed on.\n\nI will not be mentioning anything about multiplayer, because i couldn't find anyone to play with, so... yeah.  The single player campaigns 'story' is pretty basic, something about enforcing things after nukes blah blah, which I can forgive, it was a ~1.76 when i bought it and I bought it because I wanted to shoot things.  (I saw gun barrels on the car, sue me).  As soon as the first loading screen for the first 'race' took place, I was informed that "I didn't need to accelerate or brake, the car will do that for me."  This was when my previously mentioned hopes were dug up, violated, and thrown back in the hole.\n\nYou can only steer, fire your gun or missile, and press space to fly.  While flying, you can somewhat 'aim' your gun, but before you get your hopes up, I feel I need to mention that the mouse doesn't aim your weapons... at all, they autoaim for you.  Meaning, while bullets can fire ~20 degrees out of your gun, you can't aim them yourself.  Now you may think that such a wide cone would be acceptable if it just aims for you, wrong.  It's finicky sometimes and while im busy steering around trying to get missiles, health and other collectables, im busy NOT firing at the enemy.\n\nAt the end of each race there is a boss, its the same as every enemy that you've come across on the road except it takes a lot more shots and ♥♥♥♥♥ out bombs and things for you to fly over.  As I said, this game is a proof of concept, but is it worth 3.00 not on sale?  I would say no, but the better question you should be asking yourself is this.  "Is it worth my time?"  The answer I feel I have to give you, is no, it's not.  If you could manually aim and BRAKE ffs, maybe, but right now? no.","October 6, 2015","false","0.4"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","36","41","3","0"

Shoot things. Etc. There really isn't much room to move around making it impossible to get creative. Graphics aren't bad. Not worth the price.\n\nWorth $0.50 if you like tunnel shooters\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

I love the arcady feel of the game! The controls are simple and the cars handle well.\n\nThis game is especially fun when played with an additional person -- one controlling the mouse and the other playing on keyboard! Forget micro-tranactions, waiting to unlock levels or for your car's fuel to recharge - they simply don't make games like this anymore!\n\nHighly recommended!","October 14, 2015","true","0.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Thoroughly enjoyed playing, reminds me of "Back to the future" with the flying cars. The background rock/metal music is awesome it fits the game perfectly. Lots of little things to do like shooting lasers, missiles and flying. Really good game, I would say this game is suitable for anyone.  I would say this game is well worth the money and would really recommend buying.","October 17, 2015","true","0.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

The graphics look OK, but enemies all look the same as do the obstacles. There isn't much of a story and the end boss is the same character over and over. There are a few different backgrounds but since they have no impact on gameplay you'll hardly notice that. The gameplay is also very barebones which mirrors the original game but even simple arcade games nowadays offer more. You can earn upgrades by winning coins and the end of each level. But the upgrades are unlocked automatically (you cannot choose how to spent your coins). Most upgrades are cosmetic, different skins that don't chance the gameplay in a meaningful way. It's not really a racing game but more of an on rails shooter since speed is controlled by the game itself and the canon automatically aims towards the nearest enemy. I blasted through the first eight (out of ten) levels on normal difficulty with no difficulty at all and then suddenly hit a wall as the difficulty suddenly spiked in level nine. In the first eight levels there are only few obstacles so it's not very important when you stay on the road and when you take off and fly over obstacles. In level nine you suddenly have to avoid large amounts of obstacles. Since the steering feels unresponsive (I was constantly either understeering or oversteering) the precission that is suddenly required is very annoying. Blasting enemies also isn't very demanding until you're suddenly overwhelmed in the last two levels. All in all it feels rushed, over simplistic and very rough around the edges.\nIt's not exactly a trainwreck of a game and some people might even find it enjoyable to try and get high scores on the leaderboard. But I would rather waste my time on another racing game.","January 27","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
