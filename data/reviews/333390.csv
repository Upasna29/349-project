One of my favourite parts was the choices and freedom Summer gave you when selecting which quest to do and how to approach it which was vastly different from the previous season and fed perfectly into the story. Overall I found the story to be very heart warming, amusing and sad at the right parts much like Loren The Amazon Princess which was also created by Winter Wolves and will be mentioned a lot in this review.\n\nAt the start of the game you chose to play as one of two Elf twins, the brother Shea or the sister Althea. While all four of the romance paths are open to you the two meant for the other twin will not end in a romance ending. Of the romances I have completed I find them to be well done and fitting for the characters, Chalassa's romance specifically sticks out as quite an interesting one which I enjoyed every second of.\n\nCHARACTERS\nAll of your party members are completely realised and unique characters which dialogue between feels natural and fitting to their characters. Even once I thought I knew all the characters a couple of them had quite dramatic character development which made my opinion and feelings for that character change entirely.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe game's turn based RPG elements are a huge step up from Loren The Amazon Princess. Each party member have different skill sets which makes the choice of the six you take into battle much more meaningful. Some of the skills require certain conditions on the enemy to be usable which makes some character combinations quite dangerous. Skills require Stamina to be cast and Stamina does not come back after each battle which makes skill usage more tactical but can get frustrating at times.\n\nThere is also now an overworld map for each season which has points of interest on them which you click to go to. There are also a couple maps which are used for areas of the game where you have to chose which point of interest to take to move across the map, these areas I enjoyed but I would have liked more of them.\n\nART\nI personally enjoy the art style used for the characters and was happily surprised by the amount of different costumes each one has, Chalassa stands out as the character who I can't think of a single costume I did not like seeing her in. The backgrounds are well drawn just like the characters.\n\nThe CG has a different art style to the rest of the game which makes them feel meaningful, they stand out as something else, which they are, much like the moments in the story at which you get them.\n\nSOUND\nI usually turn music off in games but I realised as I was playing Tales of Aravorn: Seasons of the Wolf that this game, as well as Loren The Amazon Princess, are one of the few games I actually keep the music on for. I was also pleasantly surprised by the credit song which was fitting for the end of the game.\n\nOVERALL\nI very much enjoyed my time with Tales of Aravorn: Seasons Of The Wolf. Winter Wolves have perfectly created all the characters of this game and none of them seem dull, they also improved greatly on the RPG aspects of the game over Loren The Amazon Princess. I found the story to be heart warming in the end and it kept my attention throughout. While I consider Loren The Amazon Princess to be a visual novel with an RPG aspect, Tales of Aravorn: Seasons Of The Wolf is definitely an RPG with visual novel style storytelling.\n\nIf you enjoyed the story of Loren The Amazon Princess then I would recommend you get this game since it is just as enjoyable with some nice cameos including one which I feel gives us a taste of what is to come in Tales of Aravorn: Reign of War, which was previously known as Loren The Amazon Princess 2. I also recommend you buy this game if you like RPGs or quality storytelling in video games.","January 16, 2015","true","1.4"," 47 of 57 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","47","57","4","0"

And resource management, at least on Hard or (I can't imagine) Nightmare difficulty. I played on Hard, which would not have been my 1st choice, but did it b/c, oddly enough, a great # of the Achievements you only get by doing so.\n\nPros:\n1) Fun, likable, interesting cast of characters to switch in and out of your combats.\n2) This is the 3rd RPG (after Loren & Planet Stronghold) that I've played from WW, and I enjoy the writing a lot. There's humor, there's pathos. Good mix.\n3) Art. I really like the clean, anime-like (or is it comic-like?) art these games employ. YMMV.\n4) I can only speak about Hard mode, but tactics are everything for a large # of battles, and certain boss battles will have you tearing your hair out trying to beat.\n5) Good mix of tactical situations thrown at you (e.g., an underwater fight that robs you of fire-based spells and ranged attacks) throughout the game.\n6) Turn-based combat. I find I gravitate towards this in my RPGs more and more. I'm no longer a twitch, Diablo-style player I guess.\n\nBad:\n1) I wouldn't say anything was bad, but I thought some design decisions were questionable. Which leads to...\n\nQuestionable/Not sure what to think:\n1) As far as I can tell, there's a location (3rd of 4 acts) that's only accessible via a very brief window of opportunity. Once that window closes, it's gone. And w/ it, a reasonable chance for an Achievement that shouldn't have been that hard to get.\n2) You can't consume potions, use scrolls, etc. outside of combat. I understand the decision to force you to choose wisely between upgrading gear and using consumables (essential for Hard/Nightmare difficulty!), as money is tight in this game, but I can't understand the rationale for this. Sometimes you have multiple rounds of fights, ending in a boss fight, and if you're beat up from the last round and the new enemies go 1st...you could be in trouble.\n3) If you're an Achievement junkie, which dovetails w/ people who like RPGs I believe, be warned this game will require multiple playthroughs to get most of them. For example, you'll only unlock 1 romance + 1 special skill (applies to 1 of 2 PCs). Make the wrong choices, and some boss fights you might have been looking forward to...never happen at all.\n4) Not sure I liked a small minority of the art (animals looked crude compared to other foes).\n5) It's a constant balancing act for spending what little $ you get, for most of the game. Consumables or better gear? Just accept you'll be able to purchase very little gear and make sure they're decent (not just +1 this, +1 that) choices. You will get some "keeper" items from solo quests. Which reminds me...\n6) solo, flashback quests can be a b*tch. Make sure you have liberal amounts of saved games! Also, you don't necessarily need to recreate skills you chose for your PC; some skills I never chose or got later were perfect for solo quests. In addition, you will not be able to get all solo quests, I think, unless you skip certain romance options in the 3rd act.\n\nAlright, don't want this to be TL; DR material. I'm looking forward to the DLC for a 2nd playthrough.","March 17, 2015","true","108.2"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

In some way we get only a subset of content from LtAP - less classes, less monsters, less fights, less towns - but at the same time it is a right subset, it gives more details and variety. Like, for example, you don't fight hordes of same demons, you only encounter them several times, and each encounter is interesting. Regular monster packs change just as you are accustomed to fight them, but before they begin to annoy. Fights are now less about buff-spam and require some choices and timing. Especially on Hard!\n\nSpeaking of solid - characters and game world seems to be more worked on. Dialogs are no way cheesy (which was sort of a problem with Loren), every scene is executed great, with a good script and immersive visuals. And some scenes were really stunning. It was a great experience when lighthearted story was turning into something more serious.\n\nArt is definitely a game's strong point. Yes, you are getting what you see on screenshots. And it may be missed, but the game doesn't reuse content much. Many locations and NPCs are getting appropriate graphics instead of generic ones. Followers have a great variety of costumes they wear. CGs are not numerous, but timely. And those unnoticeable small things really add to immersion.\n\nCan't miss out the romances, since it is VN and Winter Wolves' VN. Personally I haven't enjoyed them. Possible partners are not really appealing. Straight choice for Althea conducts himself like a haughty idiot, and following that storyline feels unnatural and cheesy. So romances weren't a part of a game for me.\n\nBy the way, had I said that Althea is absolutely fascinating character? It is just drawing and some lines of text, but she does seems fleshed-out, and she is amazing. With her kind heart and openness there is no wonder she became the leader of the group. And for a runaway slave she has quite a taste for pretty costumes!\n\nBottom line. If you liked Loren The Amazon Princess, what do you want? It is the same but more. Grab at the nearest sale! If you like the art, get it, the gameplay doesn't let down game art's quality. As a VN, it is one of the best you can encounter on Steam. Not much a competitor with major RPG titles, though - but a good one for indie tier.\n\nIf you decide to buy it, consider buying DLC as well - ending is quite rushed and not impressive without it.","June 22, 2015","true","51.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedCyka/recommended/333390/","RedCyka","Red Cyka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedCyka/","96 products in account","This game belongs to a niche genre popularly known as "Visual Novel", a characteristic of the genre is a heavy amount of text and dialogue between characters that plays out with periodic input from the player which can result in different outcomes. Winter Wolves are excellent at this genre, and I have encountered several decisions that seemed to have little impact at the time, but came up later with unexpected outcomes.\n\nThis game, like other Winter Wolves games, also has Classical RPG elements, such as character levels, stat building, item shops that sell various gear and potions, traditional turn based combat, and some adventure elements like a world map that can lead to different battles, treasures, character encounters, and unlock additional conversations.\n\nAs you play the game you will meet a variety of characters with their own unique backstories, you can take them with you in battle and talk to them at various points throughout the game to unlock dialogue and build relationships with them that can grow into friendships, rivalries, and romance depending on choices you make. This can effect things as the game progresses.\n\nI'm somewhat picky about the genre, but Winter Wolves is very skilled at it.\n\nI recommend the game with the caveat that if you can't stand reading this game isn't for you, but if you've managed to read this far into the review there is a good chance that you will appreciate it. The game also has some really cool musical scores, so the sound track may actually be worth buying if you're into that.","January 21, 2015","true","13.3"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

The battles are all turn-based, with each class having unique abilities, and I felt that the game, much like Loren the Amazon Princess, was very well-balanced.  Normal is fair, while Easy and Hard live up to their names.  The story, while interesting, is a bit predictable at parts, but the characters are generally a lot of fun.  There's a decent amount of content: probably about 15-18 hours for a first playthrough, with some replay value due to the ability to play as one of two main characters and the various romance options.\n\nTo address the current one (1) negative review (by the user durandyl), I understand that he or she went into it expecting a much different type of game.  To be clear, Tales is NOT meant to be a hardcore dungeon crawler or anything of that sort, and you will be very disappointed if you buy it looking for something in that vein.  There is a decent amount of combat, and it's pretty well done, but there is a large focus on the story and characters.  As a result, the game is very text-heavy.  As I mentioned above, this is definitely part visual novel.\n\nIt's also important to note that, despite all of the constant mentions of and comparisons to the previous game in this universe, Loren the Amazon Princess, it is not necessary to have played that game to enjoy Tales of Aravorn.  All of the prominent characters are new, the story is not a direct continuation, and the game even takes place in a different part of the world (like entries in the Elder Scrolls series).\n\nFor those interested in how this compares to Loren, though...\n\nTales > Loren (things ToA does better then LtAP): I really enjoyed the addition of an overworld map and some of the refinements made to combat.  The overarching story is probably a bit stronger and less generic, as well.\n\nLoren > Tales: The character classes in Loren felt much more distinct.  In Tales, all of the mage-types, for example, were largely interchangeable in combat, whereas in Loren, each mage subclass had a unique niche, which made it more important to choose your party composition strategically.  Also, I wasn't as fond of the romance options here, but to be fair, I played Loren with the DLC which added some additional love interests; Tales may get DLC later that will do the same.\n\nOverall, a lot of fun, and a definite recommendation to Winter Wolves fans.  For those unfamiliar with Loren or with Winter Wolves games in general, Tales of Aravorn is a well-made game, and will be very enjoyable **as long as you understand what kind of game it is (i.e. not a hardcore RPG, but not 100% visual novel - you will be expected to do combat).**","March 30, 2015","true","21.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

What do i base this off of? I think the story elements of both games was pretty well set but in Loren you could actually beat all the bosses introduced in the game. I won't give spoilers but I will tell you in ToA there were a few bosses that i wanted to completely beat and never got to (very disappointing)  Also the selection of skills was actually more advanced in Loren than in tales of aravorn also. The way ToA changed it though did make a lot of battles more difficult and went toward more of an rpg element.\n\nRomance options weren't as often and by the end of my game i didn't even get a romance to finish out.\n\nOffhand the game is still fun although i prefer Loren over this. My advice is to wait for a sale i got it during 35% off winter sale and i would only recommend buying this and the dlc when it's at least 50%.\n\nThe lack of being able to take care of certain bosses in this game makes me feel like it is incomplete.\n\n7/10 rating.

I plan on playing on hard and eventually nightmare. There are additions to the game that would have been welcomed but all in all it was a good game. I personally would of loved a "respec" feature. Reading a description of a skill/talent is different than using it in combat. Just my .02 USD.\n\nI would appreciate a "story" mode, but it would not be a deal breaker for me playing the game. A suggestion if possible is auto resolve battles like Rome Total War. I know they are not the same thing. But it was the first example I had in my head. Like crunch the numbers of the current heroes versus the current enemies and get a prediction of who would win. Then decide to fight it out or CPU resolve it for time-saving.\n\nI liked the isometric map. It made the game more immersive. I liked having some freedom to pursue my quest completion. I think many people are comparing this game to Loren The Princess of the Amazon. I see that as fair but not accurate. These are two different games with two different scopes and scales of the world of Aravorn. The scope SOTW is magnified and the game is epic for different reasons. The fighting was different than Loren, but it was a small learning curve for any RPG veteran to overcome.\n\nI didn't know there were over 100 battles in the game. I guess people played this game for different reasons. I played it to flesh out the romances and was captivated by the humor. The story was palpable due to the great writing and art.

There are parts of an RPG like exploration and battles, but the game still focusses a lot on dialogue and story (more so than a usual RPG, it's more of a visual novel hybrid) - and the dialogue is very bland and simplistic. While it isn't riddled with grammar or spelling errors it's simply not engaging enough to make this worth playing, and it feels a bit like written by a teenager and then polished up for proper spelling while retaining the simple-minded cliche contents.","February 6","false","0.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Overall i like this game. Step in right direction. WW stated that this game not a vn with focus on romance but a rpg with few elements. They are mistaken. We not talking about useless cheap hentai vn which made purely to grab some cash.\nSeason of the wolf is how proper VN look like. Loren have strange obsession on flirting and puting romance before story. Cheesy dialogs and to much of sexy outfists.\nSeason of the Wolf follow pattern of grand VN. You have a story, gameplay. Characters that not just another partner but a real person relevant to story. And Romances as addition to that.\n\n\nGood\n-Money. You have so little gold that oyu cant buy everything you want. Want to recover hp and sp without wastin day? Pay us. Want to not die in next fight? Buy potion and new armor.\nUnlike Loren you have to use items. You dont have 50-70 of each after few hours. Geting even 1 potion is a hard choice. Whic leads us to...\n-difficulty. Unlike Loren i cant just wipe anyone with few spells even on nightmare mode. I was forced to use items, change positions and choose my fights. Gold limits you. Can you fight 4 battles in row while having lower hp and sp each time? Or will you spend almost everything you got from previous fight to heal? How much gold will you keep and how much spend on new items? Maybe keeping those 200g could save you after tough fight.\nWW did this part right. Like in Atelier series(or other semiliar) you have to manage your buget. No longer you just collect gold and rarely spent it. You are always in red.\n-Items. In Loren shops were uselsee. They sold bad items. You never felt a single need to buy anything. Even potions. Loot gtannted you far better items.\nNot anymore. Gather filthy pelts and glands to scrap some coins for you new helmet or single pitiful potion. You got something cool from battle? Consider yourself lucky. Greates stuff of exeptional qulity can be found only in shops. 2nd season even have gambling shop. Items here can have lower price or higher than normal. You wait for every restock to see what new shops have to offer and thats already something.\n-Battle system. Same as Loren yet somehow better. You still have few skills to use. Half of them locked to staggered condition which happens not that often. But those skills actually work. You fell need to use them. Im not just attacking with one of the spells. I am choosing which condition i want to apply. Do i want to scare my enemy to kill it faster or to slow it down so he will not oblitirate my tank? Unlike Loren where 3 mages in back row spammed aoe spells to win every fight here each character has something to offer. Finishing move from Vaelis, OP healing from druid, Buffs and debuffs from illusionist and etc.\n- Story. Cant say much. I didnt finis game yet. For now story is on personal level. You follow story of 2 twins who got in trouble. No big scary evil or grand dissaster for now. Masses could be dissapointed. They love fighting faceless hordes of emons but i prefer another way. Loren already offered classic save the world cliche. I hope this game will not copy that.\n-Dont know what else to describe.\n\nBad\n- area elemental debuffs.\nThat was really bad idea. You basicly forced to choose skills in order.\nLearning something else than water spell in 1st season is stupid as 90% encounters favor oyu using water spell. Season 2 demand you to use fire spell. I didnt know what will come and learned earth spell and now i must suffer. (hard difficulty). At same time monster individual resistance lose any meaning. Who care if that monster have 5% more resistance to fire if area grants you 25% buff on it?\n- Money. Not enough money to buy proper armor or weapon. Unlike Loren we actually have something to buy. Shops offer some awesome stuff for you in differen qulity levels. But game reward for fight sometimes so low that you cant even heal yourself.\n- jewelry. In most rpg it grants uniqe effects and not just +3 magic.From immunity to certain effect to new skills.\n- Some fight are too random. Necromancer anoyed so much. I tried 60 times( i counted). 10 times i brought him to 7 hp and he just healed himself back to max hp in 1 turn. Forget immortal skeletons who rise again no matter what and who can protect back row from you. I am suprised that i cant do the same. Maybe that skill belong to 3rd class (warrior) but why than Vaellis doesnt have one?\n- Will look for more.","January 18, 2015","true","87.3"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/presance/recommended/333390/","presance","BloodyValentine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/presance/","365 products in account","This game is a Visual Novel/RPG Hybrid. If you like games with good narrative and also happen to like RPGs, this might be a good game for you.\n\nSTORY\nThe game develops in a fantasy land called Aravorn. The main characters are a pair of snow elves that have to endure a series of hardships due to a twist of fate. In their quest, they will meet allies and friends that will join them to help them, but they also have their personal problems which you may want to tackle or just ignore them. The story is well written and the characters are deep and coherent (all the coherent that Rowinda can be…) and the main story as well as the personal stories of each character are quite good. You also have a few romantic interests to choose from and allow you to dig deeper into the personality of some of the characters. The story is probably the best aspect of the game.\n\nART/ANIMATION\nAs a Visual Novel, don’t expect high quality graphics and 3D animation obviously. However, the art is quite good. The character design is pretty nice, and a lot of the backgrounds are gorgeous. On the other hand, animations are scarce and simple, especially in combat where you would expect something else maybe.\n\nMECHANICS\nThe game follows the usual Visual Novel system of make your decisions, combined with a map where we can decide which place to visit next. The combat mechanics are pretty nice, with each character having an array of skills which allow the player to develop diverse strategies depending on how you develop them as they level up.\n\nMUSIC AND SOUND\nThe game soundtrack is quite good. It blends perfectly with the tone of the story in almost every scene and the combat themes are quite catchy. The SFX are nice too, although the number of combats and the abuse of certain skills might make you hate some of them.\n\nOVERALL\nGood music, memorable characters, an interesting story and a quite entertaining combat system make this game worth it. Don’t leave the mysteries of Aravorn unsolved and go for it. Furthermore, if you played Loren: The Amazon Princess and liked it, you can’t miss this one, and if you haven’t, then I really recommend you both games.\n","April 4","true","30.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The whole game feels like a hybrid of a BioWare-style Western RPG and a Japanese visual novel, taking place over four “Acts”, corresponding to the four seasons of the year.\n\nAt its heart, Seasons of the Wolf is all about its characters – a diverse group of individuals, all fallen on hard times, who are forced to work together to survive. Difficult themes like betrayal and slavery are juxtaposed with a surprisingly lighthearted tone in the way the characters talk; it can feel a little odd at times, but it makes for a lot of fun moments.\n\nIf there's a problem with Seasons of the Wolf, it's that the game is perhaps a little TOO long. Some scenes drag on to the point that the game loses its focus. The ending in particular, while still good, doesn't quite have the “oomph” you'd expect from such an epic experience.\n\nAll the same, I love how Winter Wolves attempted such an ambitious project, and with so small a budget. Overall, Seasons of the Wolf has the appeal of a visual novel while still feeling like a full-blooded video game, loaded with great combat depth and customizability – and with a free demo available, it's definitely worth a look.\n\n(Rating: 8/10 “Very Good”)","April 28, 2015","true","18.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The battle system is entertaining, the story - while not the most original - is captivating, and the romance options are a nice bonus. Recommended for people who like VNs.","February 12","true","25.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game truly shines as a diamond among the few visual novels that receive a wide release.\n\nWhile the story is more linear that one would like it to be, the gameplay offers a degree of open-endedness that is rare in the genre. Its characters, though shown motionless on your monitor, are shaken to life by their individual tales of fate, love, and desperation.\n\nThe visuals range from mediocre to gorgeous throughout the game, and it is sad to see a lack in variety in scenes and character portraits. However, such a complaint is trivial given how well-crafted this little surprise came to be.\n","March 8, 2015","true","158.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

For me the story was not as good, but it was a more challenging and tactical game than Loren. Nightmare was definitely challenging. Mind you, personally I tend to find long chains of cures more frustrating than challenging and I am not sure that is the way to go for making fights more interesting...","February 15, 2015","true","47.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's still a lot of fun, and fans of the Aravorn universe and Loren will love it all the same.\n\nNow for the long version. The combat got much better with an updated layout and some much needed streamlining, and the choice system was enhanced with actual dialogue options and what felt like more meaningful impact (despite the fact that choices once again really only influence character reputation). More stats and much better skill trees for each class were also added, really amping up the RPG gameplay. Also worth noting, the game is huge for a VN RPG. Easily one and a half Lorens, probably more.\nAs for the story, characters, and game world, it feels as though they were secondary this time around. The cast is not nearly as colorful as they were in Loren, and the overall story arc was much less compelling. That, combined with the limited and arguably worse romance options made me feel disconnected from the characters and story, and in turn the awesome universe Winter Wolves created in Loren.\nAll that being said: if you enjoyed Loren the Amazon Princess, you will probably enjoy this game. I may have a lot of negative things to say about the characters and story, but the fact of the matter is that I'm only being so hard on them because the first game was so good in that respect. Tales of Aravorn is still exceptionally well done overall, and a lot of fun to play, even if it will likely just make you nostalgic for Loren. The writing is good, the gameplay is good, it's just really solid all around. Maybe not $25 solid, but solid.\n","May 17, 2015","true","48.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its pretty linear, you can only pick one hero and 3 classes and the dialogue to combat ratio is like 10 to 1... meaning you will either have to read through terribly mundane and drawn out nonsesnse.... or just spend more time clicking through all the nonsense than actually fighting. I have lost faith in YOU, the gamers, if you give this a thumbs up. I cannot believe we have gone from such amazing party based games like might and magic, grimrock, and wizardry to laziness like this (note that might and magic 9 and 10 make me want to punch them all in the face)\n\n\n\nP.S I have never written a review and i've made some pretty terrible purchases on here before, that should count for something","March 24, 2015","false","77.6"," 6 of 67 people (9%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","9","6","67","6","3"

It plays like a visual novel in a fantasy setting with RPG elements.\nIn this game the focus is clearly stronger on the fighting and equipment systems than it was in the previous game, which is a plus.\nHowever, the story, while not bad by any means, fails to impress, as do the characters including the twin main characters. It's simply not memorable.\n\nTo summarize, I'd reccomend the game to fans of Winter Wolves' other games; if you're only slightly interested, I'd advise you to wait for a sale.","February 21","true","52.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Particuarly I enjoyed Season of the Wolf's first act! The first act was very atmospheric and calming, and intimate as well - playing as the twins, trying to support their family, gave me a strong connection to the characters. Without going into spoilers, the middle acts all had distinctive character themselves, and I enjoyed both locations because of the color and vibrancy.\n\nThat being said, the final act wrapped everything up in a hurried manner. It really felt as though we should've spent more time there. Because of this, I recommend getting the dlc.\n\nRomances! I enjoyed the bathouse mechanic as a way of getting to know your love interest, however it was awkward when it was your uncle xD Though there are fewer LIs than in Loren, after I finished the main game I found myself intrigued by persuing the others, so that's a plus. Characters are fun, but pretty superficial for the most part. A lot of the dialogue is cheesy I would say more in a likable way than a cringey way!\n\nThe music was lovely, however it kept cutting off for me, instead of looping as I'm used to. This could be an issue with my laptop! The tileset maps were great, more of this in future games would be lovely to see. I enjoyed the combat more this game. I prefered how skills were handled in Loren, but this isn't a big issue.","June 18, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
