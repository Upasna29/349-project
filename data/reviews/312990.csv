You control the cast of the movie in something similar to Contra, with a ton more violence. Controls are simple and easy to pick up and the graphics are simple but appealing. With the wide range of weaponry between the characters, it mixes up the gameplay enough to cover for the fact that there are only a handful of enemy types. Each character not only has their own main weapon, but also their own grenade attack. Some are actually pretty fun to watch in action.\n\nI haven't played Broforce, but this short game actually made me want to try it. That's about all you could ask for from a demo/tie-in like this.

The overrall game is very short (approx. 1hr), but that is to be expected as it basically acts as a free demo to Broforce.\n\nThe plot is loosely based on that of the film, it revolves around your team of seven "Expendabros" who are trying hunt down the notorious arms dealer Conrad Stonebanks. Not that you exactly care about the plot, I mean you are only playing the game for destroying everything you see.\n\nDeath is pretty swift, only takes one bullet to take you down, same rules apply to most of your enemies. It's pretty tempting to destroy the entire map but it may or may not prove difficult for you to traverse it. Soon you will begin to realise the repetitive nature of the gameplay. Everything is relatively similar, shoot guns and throw knives at the bad guys, good ol' run&gun gameplay. Even though it is pretty much the same (apart the two boss fights and a minor flexing cut scene) it still manages to entice you to finish the game. I would like to point out that some more of the flexing type gameplay would be nice, as it lets you take a short break from the more monotonous gameplay.\n\nThe pixelated graphics are nice. One of my favourite parts of this game was the excitement you had as you got to see all the different tricks that the cast had when you'd unlock them, flamethrowers, knives, etc. And the replayability of this game isn't great. I mean, I've 13hrs going through it so it was good enough for me, but that was only because I was pretty hyped to buy Broforce. Definately enjoyable to play, free and fun, it's worth your time.\n\nSummary\nPros\n+Enjoyable unlocking characters\n+Effectively serves as a demo for Broforce\n+Jam-packed with testosterone\n+Free\n\nCons\n-Little replayability\n-Repetitive gameplay\n\nScoring:\n7.8/10\n\nLiked that review?

Put simply, this game is what happens if you take raw awesomeness, condense it into 2D, add as many explosions as will fit on the screen, and throw in a few jokes at America’s expense.\nIn this game, you play several different members of a team called “Bro Force” sent in to “Liberate” whole regions of what I can only assume is the 3rd world, and they do this by killing absolutely everybody there in a hail of bullets, bombs and deadly knife attacks.\nWith names like “Trent Broser”, “Bro Ceaser”, and “Broctor Death” this team of elite demolition experts chase down an evil villain by “liberating” any region they find him in. Then, when everyone is dead, they are airlifted away, just as the landscape blows up (just to make sure everyone really KNOWS they have been “liberated”)\nSo turn off your brain, and turn on this game, and laugh maniacally as you destroy a sizable portion of the 3rd in the name of Liberty.\nIt is pointed out repeatedly in this game that it is a shameless attempt to promote the main “Bro Force” game and the “Expendables 3” movie, but who cares, Expendabros is awesome, and if the main game and film this is derived from are anything like it, you should go get them too :)\n","October 19, 2014","true","2.0"," 56 of 62 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","56","62","7","0"

Not once did I experience any frame-rate issues and these cards are inferior to the GTX 760.  While I don't doubt the reviewers problems perhaps the game is less optimized for nVidia cards.

The bottom line is that the Expendabros is a fresh, dynamic, fun, 2D platforming pixelated, FREE shooter that is a sheer joy to play.\n\nThis game of course parodies the Expendables 3 movie and features parodies of Arnold Schwartenager, Jason Statham, Wesley Snipes, Dolf Lungren, Randy Couture, Terry Crews and of course Sylvester Stalone. There was some painstaking amount of detail in the artwork for the game and a lot of brief, yet hilarious cut scenes, especially for a free game. It is a beautiful game with a lot of vibrant, bright colors while still having an aura of grittiness. There is always a lot happening on screen and blood spattering all around.\n\nAside from the obvious, there's the actual game itself, this is a cleverly designed 2D shooter that lets you shoot through terrain, make your own paths. Not just that, but you can wall climb just in case you ever shoot yourself a hole. The controls are easy, movement, shoot, melee, jump and special. You can only shoot left and right thankfully and that works for this sort of game. The controls are so simple, but its the destruction that makes the game so complex. Blowing up barrels will destroy walls, shooting gas tanks will send them flying and murdering enemies, burning bridges, shooting down towers. Shooting down power supplies, making them explode on enemies beneath. Saw blades you can dislodge and send them rolling into foes. Its so much silly fun that feels more cartoony than violent.\n\nAt the start of each level, you have one Expendabro. This bro is randomly selected out of bros you've already unlocked. You then play through the level, and you'll find other bros to rescue from cages. To unlock bros you need to rescue a certain amount of bros. So if you have only Arnold and Stalone unlocked, you'll only rescue Arnold or Stalone until you rescue them enough times to unlock someone new. Each Expenpendabro has different guns and specials. Stalone has a standard two pistols and a triple grenade. Couture has a flame thrower and napalm. Statham has knives that shoot like a gun and a knife shower special with a high arc. Dolph has a sticky grenade launcher and a RC bomb car. Terry has a chaingun that will push him backward for how powerful the gun is and a special that will make him leap across the screen. Wesley has melee only that can destroy projectiles and some kind of flying melee special making him the Wolverine of the group (Wesleyrine).\n\nSince the cages have random bros that you've unlocked in them, this allows for a lot of play diversity and replayability. You can't switch bros unless your current bro dies, then you respawn back to the last checkpoint and you play as a random bro remaining that you've rescued on that level. The level doesn't reset itself, the terrain still stays ruined as you destroyed it. In a way, it makes a new level. If you lose all of your bros you restart the level and the terrain resets. These levels are short, but again its legitimately so much fun to play even if a speed runner can get through each level in under a minute. Each level has multiple paths, but with the destruction you can make your own paths. Wall in your way? No problem when everything is destructible. At the end of each level, you'll 'get to ze chopper,' and jump on to have it carry you away. It all adds to the creativity and cleverness this game and its devs have to offer.\n\nThere is a wide array of enemies and they add a lot of personality to the game even if they get out shined by famous parodies. There are attack dogs that will eat enemies as well as you, fat attack dogs, standard soldiers, suicide bombers that don't attack, but explode when dead, bro seeking missile launchers, giant chaingun soldiers, big fat bosses, rocket trucks, and many more types of enemies. There are pigs too, but they don't attack, they're there to be adorable. They react to your bullets, they'll hear you and come running. Sometimes they run away. You can use your melee for stealth kills. When you destroy ledges they're standing on, they can fall to their death. They can burn, be beheaded by gunfire and run around without their head until they drop dead. Seeing attack dogs eat corpses. Throwing a grenade, having it cling onto an enemy who then panics and runs away straight into a saw blade completely unplanned or unscripted. Again, there's a lot of charm than it is horrible violence. There's always a lot going on screen.\n\nExpendabros did what every great demo does and it made me want to play Broforce even if I didn't want to see Expendibles 3. Oh and did I mention it can be played with 4 players on screen at the same time? Chaos ensues. FREE. FREE. FREE. FREE. FREE. FREE. FREE.

The shooting feels meaty and again, going with the theme of the game, over the top. There's a handful of enemy types and traps to face off against and a whole bunch of characters to choose from, each with their own weaponry and special ability, each more fun than the last. Oddly enough, the game has destruction physics, you're able to destroy pretty much anything in your way, even the terrain, which adds so much replayability to a short taster of Broforce.\n\nMy only real complaint would be the bossfights, there's only two in the game (technically three but the first two are the same boss) and each one feels very unfair. I understand it's going for a hardcore retro feel, but there's a fine line between meaty challenge and frustatingly unfair. Also, I found that I could exploit both of the bossfights using the destructible terrain.\n\n(WARNING: SPOILERS FOR AN HOUR LONG GAME AHEAD) For the first boss (second encounter) I found that I could climb on top of the tower and the robot and his missiles couldn't reach me. He eventually did the ground slam attack so many times that he destroyed the terrain underneath him and fell through the floor. For the second, all I did was climb onto the roof of the building and grab onto the side of the machine and punch my way in. If it weren't for these exploits, the bossfights would be rage-inducing to say the least.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. Absurdly fun, addictive gameplay, fantastic visual style, suprisingly great destruction physics and an overall 'MERICA! vibe to it and was worth the nothing I paid for it. I reccomend the Team America soundtrack whilst playing it. DEFINITELY picking up Broforce!\n\n8/10\nGreat!","December 6, 2014","true","6.9"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","18","20","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/312990/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1777 products in account","The Expendabros was released in order to promote Broforce (a game by the same developers) and The Expendables 3, which is the movie that inspired the characters found in The Expendabros.\n\nThis is mostly a one hour long demo of the more intricate Broforce. With that said, I had fun playing what was there and I am now more interested in Broforce and at least curious about The Expendables movies. Graphically speaking, the pixel art is great. There is much attention to detail given to the backgrounds, to the explosions and to all characters (both friendly and enemy). The controls are tight and responsive while the sound design matches the artwork's polished quality. The overall presentation and feel of the game are its shining points despite being promotional software. To be fair, this game may be deserving of a small price tag even though it's only one hour in length.\n\nEach of the playable characters are well thought out and play completely different from each other in regards to the weapons used and their special attacks. Concerning these playable characters, an interesting design choice has been made, as the player is not allowed to choose which character to use. As you rescue prisoners scattered throughout the levels and as you die, the game randomly selects a playable character for you. This means that even if you may have a go-to character for maximum damage or if you prefer playing with this or that character, the game forces the player to become familiar with all available characters. It's also important to mention that the game froze on the second to last level once and the controller bindings menu was totally glitched visually. In the end, this is a high quality, short promotional game that is worth the hour it offers of fun.\n\nThe Expendabros is good.","May 11","true","1.5"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

It seems to be an attempt to publicise BroForce, yet they still have created a beautiful short game to entertain us for a little while. Plays great with a controller (if you reformat the controls!), and is definitely fun with friends. Co-op really makes this game worth the while.\nI seem to be accidentally murdering friends, and vice versa, yet enjoying it. You can work together with your friends, or brutalise them for the hell of it. You can also leave your friends alone to die in beautiful explosions as you fly magestically onto the helicopter... And then you realise they shot down the helicopter...

The Expendabros is a 2D sidescroller where you play as the main cast of the Expendables 3, and your job is to infiltrate a variety of locations and, well, to cause carnage and destruction.\n\nEach character that you can play as has their own methods of killing, as well as their own unique special ability, ranging from knife throwing, to grenade launchers. This also adds some degree of strategy to the levels, because where one weapon will be optimal, another could cause you to meet your death. I haven't found a way to swap between team members on the fly, but maybe that was intentional. Most of the game is somewhat easy, but there are a couple of challenging boss fights in the late stages.\n\nThe game is kind of short (took me less than a couple of hours to complete), but it's packed with fun and is free to play.

The terrain is destructible by every explosion and you can use a lot of different characters with their own weapon and special attack (the weapons vary from shotgun, to knives, to, sticky bombs and even machine guns), that's because The Expandabros is a free game based on Broforce, just like in Broforce your objective is to infiltrate terrorist bases and kill the boss of each sector while shooting at every thing you find (from stantard enemies to big guys with machine guns, to kamikazes, tanks and ferocious dogs). There are also some challenging boss battles to spice things up and creating massive chain reactions with the exposive tanks placed around the leves is incredibly fun.

Apparently. At least, that's what other reviews say.\n\nI wanted to like this game because I was so looking forward to Broforce, which I still have not played, but ultimately found it to be repetitive and boring. Pretty much everything can be easily destroyed, so you can just plow straight through the level, making level design irrelevant. There's no strategy. Just shoot and move to the right.\n\nThere aren't many enemies, just 5-6 or so. And the boss fights are far and few between.\n\nThe fun parts:\nUnlocking different members of the team, each of whom has a different weapon.\nBoss battles. There are only two, unfortunately, and they're spread apart.\nThe cut scenes where you have to mash a button to do something. Sadly, this was only used in two spots. This isn't anything mind-blowing, but it broke up the monotony of the game, and it would have been nice to see more of these breathers.\nThe last two levels. I won't say more, but these two levels are the exception to the repetitive levels throughout the majority of the game.\nWhat's frustrating is that there are components of a great game here. As stated before, this is effectively a demo for Broforce, so my expectations may be too high. If Broforce is less repetitive and has more boss battles, then great. If Broforce is pretty much the exact same as The Expendabros, then I'll be really disappointed.\n\nAs a game, it would get a rating of 5/10 or less. But it's really a demo, so ...\n\n7/10 (as a demo). Good way to kill an hour or so. It is a clever promotional took for The Expendables 3, so props there, and it was free.","March 10, 2015","true","1.8"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","18","32","0","1"

I got myself a good find here.\nFun, explosive, nostagic, Contra-style gameplay. Jumping and shooting dying from a single hit. I might put that last one in the "Con's" category, but it makes things... authentic, shall we say. Check.\nAlmost Entirely destructible enviroment. If your careful, you can just move to the bottom of the level and just tunnel through it until you reach the end. Then you have to figure out how to go up... Honestly, that would be boring. There's no enemies to worry about down there... Anyway though, Check. (Honestly though, burrowing was the only way I could beat the robot boss on hard. I... sorry. Don't want to spoil that.)\nFun and witty (Okay, not excatly witty, but certainly fun) characters and story. From the enemies screaming in high-pitched voices of fear,"BROFORCE! BROFORCE" to the bald Eagle perched on your truck, to the "interrogation" scene (those are sarcasn quotes by the way. It got quite a laugh out of me) to even the credits, the game refuses to take itself seriously to almost the same level as Borderlands.  That's a check.\nAll the playable characters feel so wonderfully overpowered. Each one not only has a unique weapon, but a unique grenade. An RC car that detonates on command. Using a Minigun to jump and deal a massively destructive ground pound upon landing. Tossing a flare to call for a missle strike on the area. So Overpowered. Oh, so wonderfully, explosively overpowered. Check-a-roo.\nBut at the same time, that sheer amount of combat power doesn't keep you from dying. Check, check, and double-check.\nAll for the low, low price of... what was that again? Oh yeah: FREE.\nI'm going to be honest, There is one big con to this game. It will probably take less than two hours of playtime to beat it on both Normal and Hard difficulty, but it was a great two hours. Of course, that's not exactly unexpected. It's basically a promo for Expendables 3 meets Broforce, but instead of just watching explosions on your TV and thinking,"Hmm, this appears as though it will be a fine movie. Jeeves! Ready the car, would you. I believe I'm going out tonight. Indeed." you get to shoot/stab/dismember/explode/drop-to-their-death/punch enemies and yell,"THIS IS THE GREATEST TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE!!!! DANG IT!!!! WHY IS THAT BUZZ SAW THERE!!!! SUCK GRENADE!!!! BOO-YAH!!!!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/notbokeh/recommended/312990/","notbokeh","bokeh .edG","http://steamcommunity.com/id/notbokeh/","40 products in account","Summary: This chaotic side scroller includes various characters with their own individual unique and hilariously over-powered weaponry to bust down the vacant minded terrorists that await their demise. The graphics of this familiar pixelated platform shooter are pleasing to the eye with the extensive gore and stunning explosions that compliment the fast paced action. Not to mention how almost every part of the map is ready to be blown to bit either by the millions of conveniently placed explosives or your very own characters special abilities. However, no game is fully complete without it's manly narrator who sounds like he has enough testosterone to put Terry Cruz to shame. I wouldn't be lying if I said this game is more chaotic then it is easy.\n\nBottom-line: This game is the epitome of manliness. Embodies the true American, terrorist busting, muscle flexing, testosterone boosting, carnage inducing, action movie spirit.","December 26, 2014","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You must not expect too much more.\n\nThe only bad? point...\nis that the char you play with is completely random, each life you have a different one, and some are really OP, others hard to play. Also some smalls lags in the design, playable tho ^^.\n\nIf you like the Metal Slug series I really think you would have a good time there.\n\nAlso it's free, yes probably a demo of Broforce, why not have fun and play it when you want to play a game with some friends.

This game has a bunch of action packed levels, and has a coop feature, which makes it even more fun, ive had a blast completing this game with my good friend Prohammers, who im sure enjoyed the experience just as much. if your looking to kill some time , with a bunch of friends, launch this game in hard mode, and do a few time trials with friends :)\nyou should definitely get this game , if your a fan of amazing 2D art, action, and all out spam :)","February 12","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spookymajoraclown/recommended/312990/","spookymajoraclown","[Jet] Espeon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spookymajoraclown/","638 products in account","NOTE: I haven't actually bought Broforce, but i played through the "Brototype" back when it was available. Any comparisons i make to Broforce are based on the "Brototype", which had far less features than the current Broforce that is on steam.\n\nUPDATE: Bought broforce over... christmas, i think. It's fairly hard to remember when i started spreading all this DEMOCRACY and AMERICAN FREEDOM. It was a couple months back after this edit anyhow. Didn't really change the review tho, cause it's still fairly accurate IMHO.\n\nAh, The Expendabros. After playing through the Broforce "Brototype" back in late 2013 and forgetting about the game for a while, i was surprised to see a free Expansion to Broforce. At first i ignored it, figuring it required the Base Game. After finding out it didn't however, i downloaded it out of curiousity, only to be mildly miffed when i found it was a Movie Tie In to the Expendables 3. After all, Movie Tie In's are almost never good, and i highly doubted even Broforce could manage to make a decent one.\n\nI was both Correct and Incorrect.\n\nIncorrect in the fact that it is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. It carries that sort of Gung Ho, silly action movie vibe that the movies carry, just boosted to a ridiculous degree. SAWS, EXPLOSIONS, EVIL DICTATORS, all of it in the silly style of Broforce. The gameplay is just as great as the core game. Every character feels different, the visuals are extremely fitting for the silly style of the game, and it's just really really fun.\n\nCorrect in the fact that it's fiendishly difficult in later sections for no good reason, and it's buggy. I mean, REALLY buggy. I had to restart the final boss three times because either the game suddenly made my controller drivers stop working entirely, or because i paused at the wrong time and now the final boss's dialougue would never end. You can also break cutscene triggers at times, making it impossible to advance. And all of the Characters, except for Arnold Schwarzengger's character share one problem: They all have a pitiful range. This is exemplified by Doctor Death, who turns the game from a side scrolling shooter, into a Side Scrolling Beat Em Up. This can make for some extremely cheap feeling deaths, as you just couldn't hit the enemies with any character. Again however, this is completely averted for Arnold's character, who is probably the best character in the game... and the last to be unlocked.\n\nOh, and there's one more problem: It's short. Really short. This is a bit of a nitpick honestly, since it's free and kind of more like a Demo of Broforce, but still, i beat it in just under an hour even with the final boss glitching out three times.\n\nAll in all, i did quite enjoy this demo/tie in game, even with the massive flaws it has. Reccommended.","August 6, 2014","true","1.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game is so bro-tastic. First thing first, bro. (Real review now, no more "bro" bits) This is not what i would consider an actual game, more like a broforce demo. (If you've played broforce then you already know how cool this game is and shouldn't be reading this review). First off, if you see it, it can be blown the ♥♥♥♥ up. Second, I tunnled my way through the entire 1st level, then replayed it and shot my way through, then i decided to kill myself in the 1st level just cause the deaths are funny. That was just my 1st hour of play too. Graphics don't mean ♥♥♥♥ when it comes to games like this. Replayablity is not good. Once done that's it, just restart from the beginning. Good to kill time but with just 4 hrs in i already beat it. Anyways, not much else to say. Good game (demo) and it's free so try it, you don't like, uninstall.","August 10, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/312990/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","As a free promotion for a rather silly movie, "The Expendabros" goes farther than it really needs to. If you just included the cast in "BroForce", most people would consider that satisfactory. That Free Lives went ahead and produced a short campaign centered around the Expendables is pretty damn awesome.\n\nIt's also quite neat that this game acts as a demo, of sorts, for the main "BroForce" game. Having played a bit of it at a public event, I can say that "BroForce" is defintitely better than this. That being said, I wouldn't pass up on the opportunity to try this out. That "Early Access" tag might frighten some people, but "BroForce" is great.\n\nA lot of that depth also translates into "The Expendabros". Having some hilarious cutscenes that parody the overuse of QTEs and thinking of humorous ways to call Stallone a "bro" are just icing on the cake of delicious explosions and calculated environmental destruction.\n\nFor a movie tie-in, this is one of the all time best. For a run-n-gun style game, this is pretty solid. As for a full product, the game is a bit too short (30 minutes on Hard). Still, the price is very acceptable (you'd have to be insane to complain about that) and you can always get "BroForce". Definitely recommend this.","August 11, 2014","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This Broforce Expendables 3 crossover, was an unexpected gem. I enjoyed Expendabros enough to be interested in buying this developers other games, including Broforce and any future games/ content they may make. I myself am not a huge fan of Expendables, but this game succeeded in at least making me want to learn a little more about the series, so mission success.\n\nOverall Expendabros is worth downloading, its small fun and action-packed!

The controls are great ,but it gets pretty tricky to play local co-op with a friend because the layout of the keys are baldy placed so there is little room for both people playing (rebindable keys would help a lot). Dispite this I highly recomend you play it with someone else, it may be harder than playing alone but in my experience I found it to be a lot more fun than alone. All the little details in it make for a hilarious  time (even the credits are funny), especially the anouncer theat screames everything he says  and won't calm down, adding to the extreme nature of this game (Although some may not find it funny). The game is really short but it can be played in a variety of ways that are complimented with the fact that the different characters you play as are very different, some may be tricky at first but all of them are good if  you learn to play with them.Though you can't change the characters i find it to be better than choosing them in this case to add to the variety of the game.The Expendables 3 theme fits in perfecly with Broforce making for a very entertaining way to promote the two without annoying ads that keep poping up in your face, which made me really want to go watch the movie and buy the game.

This game is so bro-tastic. First thing first, bro. (Real review now, no more "bro" bits) This is not what i would consider an actual game, more like a broforce demo. (If you've played broforce then you already know how cool this game is and shouldn't be reading this review). First off, if you see it, it can be blown the ♥♥♥♥ up. Second, I tunnled my way through the entire 1st level, then replayed it and shot my way through, then i decided to kill myself in the 1st level just cause the deaths are funny. That was just my 1st hour of play too. Graphics don't mean ♥♥♥♥ when it comes to games like this. Replayablity is not good. Once done that's it, just restart from the beginning. Good to kill time but with just 4 hrs in i already beat it. Anyways, not much else to say. Good game (demo) and it's free so try it, you don't like, uninstall.","August 10, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/312990/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","As a free promotion for a rather silly movie, "The Expendabros" goes farther than it really needs to. If you just included the cast in "BroForce", most people would consider that satisfactory. That Free Lives went ahead and produced a short campaign centered around the Expendables is pretty damn awesome.\n\nIt's also quite neat that this game acts as a demo, of sorts, for the main "BroForce" game. Having played a bit of it at a public event, I can say that "BroForce" is defintitely better than this. That being said, I wouldn't pass up on the opportunity to try this out. That "Early Access" tag might frighten some people, but "BroForce" is great.\n\nA lot of that depth also translates into "The Expendabros". Having some hilarious cutscenes that parody the overuse of QTEs and thinking of humorous ways to call Stallone a "bro" are just icing on the cake of delicious explosions and calculated environmental destruction.\n\nFor a movie tie-in, this is one of the all time best. For a run-n-gun style game, this is pretty solid. As for a full product, the game is a bit too short (30 minutes on Hard). Still, the price is very acceptable (you'd have to be insane to complain about that) and you can always get "BroForce". Definitely recommend this.","August 11, 2014","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It defenitely has a pleasent replay value to it none of the less. I have not seen the Expendables 3 movie itself, but needless to say that I never realized how fun it would be to play as the characters featured in the movie and being able to blow up a bunch of terrorists because you know, WHO DOESN'T LIKE EXPLOSIONS?! In a good way it surprises me how that almost everything is destructable except the ladders (but personally I think it creates a disadvantage at times for when you need to reach higher altitudes but the climbing using knifes makes up for it) since I'm so used to playing shooting games, regardless of the kind, where almost everything is practically indestructable and that gets boring after a while. Ultimately this game kind of represents the fighting spirit the United States and how we appreciate being a part of a free nation and having liberty as well as what we would do to protect it. If you want a fast paced side scrolling shooter with a bunch of explosions, then definetly go for Expendabros, you won't be dissapointed","September 22, 2014","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's Broforce, it's awesome, it's free.\nOther than that, I think that Broc's knife based gameplay is incredible fun, and I'd like to see a character that plays like him in Broforce someday. Oh, and the final escape sequence at the end of the game is really, really hard. Me and my bro died easily thirty times from those *$)# sawblades- But the announcer's voice gets hoarse after you've failed a level enough times, which is amazingly hilarious.\nDid I mention that this game is free?

Hilariously, in several ways it's actually better than the version of Broforce currently in Early Access (as of August 6), because while it only has seven characters and a fairly short campaign, it actually has a story and cutscenes and stuff. And it's pretty hilarious.\n\nGet it to see if you're interested in Broforce, and also because the game stops being available after the end of this year.

There seems to be a few new badies as well, some of them stand up on towers and can shoot homing missiles at you if they spot you, and there seems to be a lot of deadly machines that can throw heat seeking rockets and sawblades towards you, I died a lot on those partcular levels.\nIf your thinking about buying broforce but don't know if your computer can handle it or if you'll enjoy it.

Not willing to fork out the $14, but on sale I would buy it right away.\n\nThis game really surprised me and lived up the Overwhelmingly Positive rating. This is some of the best use of Pixel and 2D graphics ever. The whole map is basically destructible, lots of guns, climbing walls, knife kills, cut-scenes and ridiculous content.\n\nI've always loved Golden Ax and Double dragon and this takes that format and sets it on fire. Don't be fooled this game is challenging, 1 bullet kills! CoOP is available and would be amazing.\n\nWorth $10 - Free as a demo for Bro-Force\n\nAccidently Reviewed Was this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

The game features 7 parody versions of the expendables roster, taking to the field, doing what they do, blow ♥♥♥♥ up, and eating good ol american apple pie. Well, maybe not the pie, but definitely blowing ♥♥♥♥ up.\n\nWhat can I say? It's a free game! A great way for those who haven't tried Broforce to get a good taste, and for those who already own BroForce, well, this is basically free extra content. Nothing wrong with that. Honestly, how can you complain when you get a free mini version of BroForce?\n\nI think it goes with out saying that you should play this. It wont cost you a cent, it's not a very big download, and explosions.\n\nPros:\n- It's free\n- Explosions\n- Testosterone\n- America\n- Democracy\n\nCons:\n- It's free so it supports socialism","August 5, 2014","true","0.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

You play through two "stages" from the main game as the characters from the film, who play almost identically to the original Bros.\n\nExpendabros is an interesting game, in that it functions as a movie tie-in, a standalone expansion and teaser for both the film and game. There's a self-contained plot that utilizes short cutscenes, a couple of contextual prompts and some slightly remixed level elements to create an experience that is worth checking out at least once.\n\nIf you're interested in trying out Broforce (or even if you have the game), it's worth giving this a spin. It's free, short (my playthrough took only half-an-hour) and has a decent amount of fun.\n\nWell worth a look.","October 9, 2015","true","0.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

It is amusingly commentated throughout, the cut scenes i think are the funniest. pure shoot em up heaven and the game is Free!!!!

You die in one hit, so you might try to play it smart OR become a god at this.\n\nIn any case the levels are diversified and short but a lot of fun, there's a decent amount of enemy variety and since you have an unlimited amount of continues it's no problem if the randomness gets you stuck with  a character you're not too confident about and gets you killed in the end.\n\nOverall: just try it out!","September 20, 2014","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
