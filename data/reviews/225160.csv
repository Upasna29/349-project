"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/225160/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","This "Redux" version of Shadow Warrior is identical to the "Megaton" edition of Duke Nukem 3D: The idea here is to have one compilation for the game that contains everything from the original, classic FPS.\n\n1) We have Shadow Warrior here with enhanced graphics. This includes higher resolution options, vsync, smoother lighting and overall better textures. There is a new main menu and slightly changed music. This game still kicks ♥♥♥!\n2) The classic Shadow Warrior is also available. This has the good old main menu (it now looks quite dated) and the original graphics. I'm not sure why this is here since the enhanced version has the same core elements, the same atmosphere anyway.\n3) Wanton Destruction and Twin Dragon expansion packs that contain new stories, new levels. I like how Wanton was released in 2005 - almost 8 years after the release of the original game. It proves it truly became a classic and it was properly looked at and authorised by 3D Realms.\n\nBut then what is Shadow Warrior? It is a game with a funny protagonist similar to Duke Nukem's. The player now assumes the control of Lo Wang who fights Zilla Enterprises with his Katana and dozens of one-liners. Some of the weapons are quite creative: you can use a heart as a weapon (needs to be ripped from one particular enemy) and by pressing the heart a clone of Wang appears and fights alongside you. There is also the head of a certain enemy that can be used to launch fire at the opponents.\n\nThe idea is the same here: shoot first, ask questions later! We collect key cards, kill enemies, look for secret areas (grab the fortune cookies always for the funny messages!), fight some pretty tough bosses and kill even more enemies! Classic '90s but a bit more challenging perhaps than Duke Nukem. Some of the weapons barely have ammunition or their spread / accuracy is just awful (shurikens, shotgun). I'm sure this was intentional. Just as picking a dark shadow as an enemy who can quickly launch fireballs at you. That is some tough son of a b*tch!\n\nThis is a highly recommended compilation especially if you are familiar with the game and / or already purchased Duke's Megaton Edition. Beware: The Classic version can be bought separately but since the Redux edition includes it there is no need to grab that one.\n","July 13, 2015","true","4.1"," 44 of 50 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","44","50","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/225160/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","This is a long review, so if you want to know why I recommend this series skip to the Results and read from there. Although, if you want to know about a specific game in the series skip to that section.\n\n3D Realms and General Arcade work together to bring the classic Shadow Warrior and its two expansions to the modern era. Shadow Warrior is an epic first person shooter that combines puzzle solving, fast paced combat, and explosions everywhere.\n\nGameplay:\nShadow Warrior is a crazy first person shooter that offers jokes, violence, and crazy level design. The game is rather simple in first person shooter standards, as an older game it doesn’t possess the features of newer games. The missions are typically small and require getting keys in order to unlock later parts of the mission. There are an abundance of weapons that include melee weapons and ranged weapons: Katana, Fists of Fury, Shurikens, Quad Barrel Riot Shotgun, Uzi, Rocket Launcher, Grenade Launcher, Sticky Mines, Rail Gun, Guardian Head, and Ripper Heart. With limited ammo, rising difficulties, and hundreds of enemies you will find yourself constantly switching between guns to fight off the hordes ahead. There a few bosses, but when they occur they offer a great fight that keeps you pressed and requires great tactics.\n\nShadow Warrior Classic:\nShadow warrior revolves around the character Lo Wang and his adventure trying to defeat Master Zilla who slayed Lo Wangs old master. Lo Wang must now avenge the death of his former master by defeating Zilla. This involves going through all of his warriors and destroying his industry one by one. The game features twenty action packed levels which involve solving puzzles, finding secrets, and defeating enemies.\n\nTwin Dragon:\nAfter many arduous hours I finally defeated the evil menace. Twin Dragon is an epic expansion that adds 16 fun packed levels onto the Shadow Warrior Campaign. The puzzles are a lot more extreme than in the original campaign and some levels I found so difficult I looked up guides to figure out where to use some of the keys I had found. Twin Dragon doesn't introduce more enemies, but rather makes rarer enemies more common. The game is packed full of Red and Grey Evil Ninjas, Serpent Gods, Guardians, and Sumos. This makes for a great addition to the series, although ti does lack some of the "secrets" that the first one has to offer.\n\nWanton Destruction:\nAnother epic expansion for Shadow Warrior. Wanton Destruction includes a whopping 12 whole leveles (2 secret levels) and new skins for some of the baddies. Although, released after Twin Dragon, Wanton Destruction follows the story the original Shadow Warrior as Lo Wang continues on his quest to defeat Zilla. The game introduces a whole variety of new tactics as it makes the ninjas stronger. Some of the levels are short and sweet while others are longer, but they are all very complex and require a lot of investigation. This fantastic addition is a great example of a great first person shooter puzzle game.\n\nResults:\nShadow Warrior Classic Redux reintroduces Shadow Warrior and its two expansions Twin Dragon and Wanton Destruction (in that order). I never played the Shadow Warrior when it came out and thus I am completely new to this series. So I have no nostalgia that made me automatically like this game, but rather I just liked it because it was a good game. This brilliant series packs over 30 levels (not including secret levels) and will give you lots to do. People who can't play old games because they cannot get past the graphics or gameplay systems might not want to invest in this title. If you played the original and just want to rehash old memories then this is the game for you. If you just want a fun game with funny dialogue and guns blazing then this is the game for you.\n\nPros:\n+Lots of guns and action with fast paced combat.\n+There are secret levels (new games seem to avoid rewarding players).\n+Many puzzles to solve without seeming to repeat themselves.\n+The levels offer traps that keep you guessing your moves.\n+There are many enemies that push you to the limit keeping you on your toes.\n+Simple story that doesn't really require playing the game to figure out, but just keeps you going as you want to fight the bosses along the way.\n+If you happen to feel some of the achievements are too hard you can easily use cheat codes and still get the achievements.\n\nCons:\n-The game started glitching on the last 7 levels where when I saved the game crashed not saving the file.\n-The mouse sensitivity is very difficult to manage and at some times can be very insensitive while at others seem hyper sensitive.\n-Judging depth can be very difficult as it’s an older game without a modern physics engine.","February 23, 2014","true","27.9"," 35 of 37 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","35","37","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/225160/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","VERDICT: Shadow Warrior Classic Redux is the complete old-skool first-person shooter.  Forget the story.  Forget the graphics.  These were the sorts of games where it was all about the gameplay.  Theres lots of short fast-paced levels to explore.  Discover obvious and not so obvious secrets.  Massive amounts of relentless combat to enjoy. Including a large arsenal of weapons with which to gib an assortment of enemies with.  Periodically tough bosses stand in your way to be defeated.\n\nIts clunky graphics may be outdated and the game speed a little too fast unless you're too young not to have played this the first time around but, the un-PC nature of the voiceover is hilarious and will make you laugh-out-loud.  Those of you who dont enjoy single-player need to push aside their PvP addiction and just try it.  If you feel the need for some old-skool Lo-Wan style kickassery then you cant do worse than start with this.  Sure there is a modern day version but this game still reeks of fun.\n\nRetro FPS at its finest.  Holy cow!!!\n\n\n... More info below ...\n\n\n01. GENRE: Retro FPS.\n\n02. SETTING: Fictonal martial-arts themed universe where corporations run the world.  With weapons.... lots of weapons.\n\n03. STORY/BACKGROUND: You are Lo-wan a shadow warrior.  A one man army of unparalleled skill and destruction.  At least thats what the store page says.  You goal is to clear the levels and finally defeat the evil Lord Zilla.\n\n04. GAME MODES: Old-skool style single-player FPS.  Contains all three episodes of around fifty levels.\n\n05. GAME/LEVEL DESIGN: OLD-SKOOL\n+ Old skool layouts that are lean and mean.  Very few areas that serve none or little purpose.\n+ Levels are themed differently to provide variety.\n+/- Find keys to open locked areas.  Allowing you to access parts of levels when they are opened up.\n- Design factors/elements are few and therefore some left or parts thereof will eventually feel the same.\n\n06. GAMEPLAY/MECHANICS: GOOD\n+ Fast-paced gameplay from a by-gone age.\n+ Large inventory for ten weapons and a half-dozen special items.\n+ Lots of gear and ammo to pick up means you can go all rambo or choose your shots.\n+ Marvellous amounts of gibbing your enemies.\n+ A few levels have vehicles & gun emplacements to mix-up how you deal with your foes.\n+/- Secrets can be fun for the first few levels but can get boring.  If you like me cant see a secret for toffee there is a function that displays how many secrets you have still to find for that level.\n- There are a very few locations that need finger-twisting difficulty to jump to the next transistion point.  Very difficult with keyboard if you arent adept.\n- Its old-skool strafing\n\n07. ENEMIES: GOOD\n+ Around fifteen different types of enemy provide decent variety.\n+ The best ones are the Sumos that fart deadly gases when dead.\n+ The worst are the explosive carrying kamikazes who come back to life as ghosts when they die.\n- None of them are deadly and can be overcome with ease.\n\n08. A.I:\n+/- A.I. is as old-skool as the game.  Basic brute-force design means the enemys only concern is to patrol is designated area and shoot when it "sees" you.\n+ Aiming however is top notch and thus unless you have very fast reflexes you will take some damage in almost every encounter.  Meaning there is a challenge in playing the game.\n\n09. INTERFACE/CONTROLS:\n+ Original PC controls have been brought along and kept at the required level for us PC users.\n+ Customizable interface allowing max equipment/inventory info can be displayed.  Or minimal if you prefer to see\n\n10. GRAPHICS: OLD-SKOOL\n- Bad if you're into modern day graphics.  Even if they are completely remastered.\n+ Great if you love blocky old-skool graphics. Played at 1920x1080 fullscreen with 400+ fps at all times. Not many games you can say that about. :)\n\n11. AUDIO: VERY GOOD\n+/- Good old-skool midi sounds, but its the voice-over dialagoue thats thats the star.\n+ Lo pan's non-PC regulated one-liners are a throwback to the 80s and will make you smile even after hearing them for the 100th time!\n\n12. CHALLENGE/DIFFICULTY: FAIRLY EASY\n+/- It has several difficulty levels.  My play through was on 2nd toughest which provided a decent challenge for the most part and a few areas that taxed my skills.  Who wants wang!?\n\n13. ACHIEVEMENTS: GOOD\n+ A mixture of level completions, perform x tasks Straightforward if 25% are not so fast to collect.\n\n14. ENJOYMENT/APPEAL: OKAY\n- Mostly has limited appeal.\n+ Fans of nostalgia or old skool FPS.\n\n15. PLAYTIME/LONGEVITY/REPLAYABILITY: OKAY\n+ Theres a good 15h+ to complete all levels.  More if you dont get the achievements or find all the secrets for each level.\n+ If you enjoy replaying levels, they are quite short and use a formula that you will pick-up once youve played a few levels.\n\n16. ONLINE PLAY/COMMUNITY: NONE\n+/- Its single-player only so no community interaction.\n+ A few die-hards still post in the forum if you need help with running the game.\n\n17. SPECS/OPTIMIZATION: GREAT\n+ Given its age, will work a dream on any modern system.  Even my Core i3 was getting 400 fps!\n- May be too fast for some older players! :P\n- Crashes from time to time.\n+ Will prompt for a report to be sent to the devs and restarts the game automatically.\n\n18. SUPPORT: GOOD\n+ All "expansions" from the old-skool original are included.\n+ For such an old game the devs who made this compatible with modern system deserve a nod.\n+/- Doubt there are any plans for patching but I guess support is not quite abandoned by the developers.\n\n19. PROBLEMS: MINIMAL\n- Gamespeed was to fast for my tired reflexes.  Only due to the aging game engine and my "modern" spec PC.  If you cant compenstate you, can try one of those CPU-slowing utilities.\n- Only stability issue was if I pressed Quickload key twice to fast.  Instant CTD.  Annoying but not gamebreaking.\n\n20. VALUE FOR MONEY: OKAY\n- Not sure if even the most retro-loving gamer would get this at full price.\n- There are better FPSs out there, even if most are politically correct.\n+ Worth it on sale.  Especially if you are a fan of the franchise.","April 30","true","35.6"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","26","28","0","0"

My main goal with this game? Enjoy an old school shooter and have fun achievement hunting. Expansions, or perhaps just the gameplay, got repetitive though and the Twin Dragon boss fight was the lowest point. Then again, pretty much all of the boss fights were a formality, but that's how they usually made them back then. For comparison, the ending of Doom II was intense for me.\n\nI had a blast with the main game. Great fun and just long enough. I liked the humor, the weapons, the setting, level design, but there's no particular need to play the expansions, unless you're still pumped up and want some more of the same. I very much appreciate the achievements (all of them single player), the modern menu, not having to mod anything, etc. Just install and play. All of id Software's back catalog should get the same treatment.\n\nThere are some bugs, like quick loading will crash the game repeatedly or the game will stop saving here and there. Exiting the game usually fixed that stuff for me. Other than that it's smooth sailing. If you need a demo, well, Shadow Warrior Classic is free on Steam. It's silly fun and I got a new favorite weapon, the Guardian Head. I'll be trying the demo for the new game soon, cos I'm hungry for more Wang.","July 24, 2014","true","34.6"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","24","28","0","6"

And to some extent it is true, but not totally and not always. Sure I played “Duke Nukem 3D” and “Doom II” in the nineties, but I somehow missed “Shadow Warrior”, so you can’t say I like it because it brings memories of good old times. No, I liked it from the first sight when it was redux.\n\nOf course I was ready to meet pixelated enemies and somewhat aged design (but still good!), so lets put it this way: re-released old game can be awesome for prepared new player. What I was not prepared to and what was a great surprise is everything else about the game: clichéd story, racial stereotypes, sexist jokes, explosive gameplay and tons of references to older classics and contemporary stuff (Easter eggs range from “Monty Python” to “Tomb Raider”). And though some of those things may sound disturbing, they put together a humbling story of an elder Asian martial arts master on a quest of revenge. Though, of course, story is not the main part in games like this one.\n\nSo focus on killing demons, exploring levels and exploding things.","February 27, 2015","true","10.3"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

The game is definitely quite difficult, but the introduction of quicksaving and quickloading eases off the difficulty for newer players. Since much of the game's humor comes from he hilariously stereotypical protagonist Liu Wang, some players may find it racist, but it's all just in good fun. The game looks good for its time, and the sound assets are great.\nGameplay wise, the game plays great. The player can fight enemies with his fists, a katana, dual-weilding uzis, a rocket launcher with optional heat seeking missiles and even a nuke, a  heart that creates a clone of Liu Wang, and more. The stage design is usually a major strength in old FPSes, and Shadow Warrior is no exception. The huge, expansive stages are fun to explore and packed with secrets. Enemy variation is not the best, but there's definitely enough to keep the player entertained.\nThe port remains faithful to the original, but one of the new editions is a multiplayer mode. It works well, but I rarely use it. One of the multiplayer's greatest strengths is the ability to design stages and share them with full Steam Workshop Support.\nIt may not be as well known as Duke Nukem 3D or Doom, but it's definitely just as good. From veterans to new players alike, Shadow Warrior Classic Redux is a classic that's definitely still worth the price today.","October 16, 2014","true","30.6"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

The enhancements to not only gameplay but also presentation are staggering and for the time, breath-taking. Shadow Warrior is a polished high speed run and gun chock full of action, fun and humor. The presentation is boasted by some of the most beautiful 2.5D graphics of the time with silky smooth animation and tons of effects like interactive environments and the ability to use vehicles.\n\nThe action is just as good as the graphics and style though, as stated it is high speed run and gun with a good variety of interesting weapons, most styled after ones used in kung-fu/asian flicks or tropes, enemies are intelligent and have a good variety and it never gets old, jumping and dodging enemy fire as you riddle them with dual UZI fire, or lurking in the shadows until you slice a hapless enemy in half, blood spraying everywhere. If you loved Duke, you'll take some time to adjust but you'll feel just at home, because everything about its gameplay has been sped up and polished.\n\n\nI want to also point out something about the game to potential buyers.\n\nWhile it has never been explicitly stated to be satire, I think it is evident that Shadow Warrior is parody/satire. Besides from the obvious goofiness of the game's story, names, wording and characters that play from tropes, the entire game itself is a running gag using all kinds of tropes or cliches and misconceptions.\n\nThe game is lampooning ridiculous stereotypes while at the same time making them strangely endearing (Lo-Wang) and just letting you have fun ♥♥♥ time. There is absolutely no spite, no toxicity, and no racism to be found in Shadow Warrior; only satire that is intelligent enough to be silly and crazy.","November 29, 2014","true","10.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

They make also more use of destructable wall than before, some for revealing secrets or to progress. The style is pretty much the same: find the end of the level, sometimes hindered by locked doors for which keys have to be found. The weapon fit the style of the game, but are not as unique as in DN3D.\nBeware that the game is very racist against asians and sexist. It spawned controvery at its release and is probably the reason why it didn't sell as well as DN3D did. Especially the comments of protagonist Lo Wang can be quiet bawdy, more than the "modern" Lo Wang in the Shadow Warrior reboot of 2013 and even Duke Nukem.\nThe Classic-Redux-Edition features improved music and graphics which look nice in Full-HD resolution but keeping the style of the original. If you prefer the low quality music and sound and heavily pixelated graphics of the original you can still play it as it is included.\nAlso included are the two expansion packs Twin Dragon and Wanton Destruction. WD was made by Sunstorm Interactiv which also made solid expansion packs for DN3D and this one follows them. They have some good level design, although it does not reach the quality of the base game, but are still worth to play. Twin Dragon on the other hand features large, mostly boring and uninspired levels that are more like the ones in modern FPS than the labyrinths of the classics. Especially annoying are the hidden mines in some levels that kill you instantly - not a good fit to a fast paced FPS.\n\nI'd recommend the game for everybody who enjoys old school FPS like Doom, Quake or DN3D, although I think Shadow Warrior doesn't reach their quality, but comes very close. The Classic Redux is probably the best version to enjoy the game today.","August 13, 2014","true","12.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

This game still holds up today. The main character, Lo Wang, has a good amount of one-liners and comments involving crude humor. On top of this, he makes verbal references to various other things, such as Speed Racer and Tomb Raider. Your goal for each level is to fight your way through the enemies, and make your way to the end of the level. Every level in itself, requires you to either some exploring and search for keys, or investigate a route to the end. There are various secret areas in each level, each containing helpful gear. In total there are 11 weapons, each having a slightly different use in combat, but overall your biggest concern should be ammounition. The combat is like that of doom, only with a quicker taste, and a sharp sword in the mix. Overall this game is enertaining, has a good sense of humor, good combat, and a likeable protagonist. 8.5/10\nTo keep it simple here is a list of pros and cons.\nPros\nLikeable Protagonist\nGood Humor\nGood Combat\nVariety of Easter Eggs and Secret Areas\nYou can make Bunnies have SexCons\nBees (toughest enemies)\nNo Tutorial\nSlighty Racist","December 24, 2014","true","14.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Shadow Warrior achieved far less fame and notoriety, which is a shame because it's at least as good. The graphics and general presentation here have not aged well, but then again I would say the same thing about DN3D. At least thanks to Devolver we can play in more modern resolutions. On the flipside, Lo Wang's oneliners are timeless and the rest of the audio is great as well. But the most memorable thing is probably the level design.\n\nThe upside of the level design is that it is great. This was a time before cutscenes and story-based shooters. There is only a bit of narrative here, and all of it is told without words, by the levels. By the environments and how one meshes into the next, a sort of journey emerges. I especially love the detailed interiors that had a lot of work put into them; the atmosphere they convey is superb and many of the houses shown are fully livable and fleshed out, from bathroom to garage. Oh, and fully functioning mirrors, something that eludes most contemporary developers... Across the base campaign and two expansions there is a total of 43 (47 if you count secrets) levels and they are delightfully varied. If you lament the single-player components of modern shooters as too short, this might be a treat.\n\nThe downside of the level design is that you'll spend a significant amount of time being stuck. Retracing your steps time and again, looking for that one key or switch that you missed and which is now completely blocking your progress. What's more, back then being stuck was considered content ("you're playing the game aren't you?!"); it was a time before the descent into casualization had begun. If you expect waypoints, onscreen indicators and corridor-shaped levels from your shooters, consider this your stark warning. There are also technical issues that I simply can not defend. Rare (but kinda regular) crashes. Occasional (but severe) graphical glitches. Issues with quicksave/load. Devolver's modernization is playable but could've used some more work. All in all this is a gem but not everyone will have the patience or perspective to appreciate it, and if you don't, I won't blame you.","May 13","true","31.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

This meant that in the fast-moving world of FPS technology, the Asian-themed successor to Duke Nukem 3D looked pretty old hat on release, and for a long time has not been remembered all that well. However, it was genuinely a great game in its own right and almost matched matched Duke 3D itself. Besides the sexism and racism (corrected in the excellent recent remake) and being arguably a little too unforgiving, SW is a neglected classic shooter of the '90s, complete with the interactivity, hectic action, zany weapons and humour of Duke 3D.\n\nThis version comes with two (already free) expansions which are surprisingly high quality. Do beware of a map set on a moving plane which while very ahead of its time, does over-reach technically meaning its exit requires a lot of trial and error. Given the beautifully redone main theme, very slick menus and hi-res support, SW Classic Redux is a must for '90s shooter fans.","December 26, 2013","true","5.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I remembered when I was a kid, I saw this game in the shelves and thought it was a knockoff of Duke Nukem 3d; but after 15 years later, getting it on steam, I really have missed out on alot! While the gameplay aspect is incredibly similar to Duke Nukem 3d (As well as other build engine games like Blood), it definitely has unique features that make the game more appealing to its older brothers. What really makes the game addictive is you can use a arsenal of bizarre and cool weapons, like a decapitated head of a monster, a multibarreled shotgun, and even the famous uzi.\n\nFor what it's worth, it's definitely worth it!

Sound is excellent, lo wang's line are hysterical and the music is excellent and fits very well with the game. Gameplay is like duke 3d but not really It has the same excellent non-linear level design and that's about it. Shooting demons feels really good which brings me to the weapons which are unique such as the shurikens,railgun,dual uzis,demon head flame thrower, a heart that clones you, and even a sticky bomb yes it predates halo. Even more unique several of the weapons have an alternate firing mode adding the diversity of the combat like a burst fire in the riot shot gun and the nuke for the rocket launcher. now shadow warrior does get repetative in parts and that's about it. this version of shadow warrior is the best cause not only is it an updated source port but also includes both the expansion packs so it's a must buy for fps fans. Now there is a reboot coming and you know what despite the changes I think it looks pretty damn awesome.\n\n9.5/10 A must buy for fps fans","August 18, 2013","true","5.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's equal parts silly and gory with plenty of camp pseudo-racism and fart jokes, the kind of which you'd expect from 3D Realms. There is a colossal amount of content (I'm currently at 10 hours and only scratched the surface of Wanton Destruction, one of two additional campaigns on top of the original's two) and plenty of semi-nude anime girls if you're willing to put the time in. The enemy rota may be somewhat small, but each brings something unique and interesting to the field, which each campaign adding new enemy types.\n\nHowever the most impressive feature in my eyes is the inclusion of pixelated 3D models to replace the sprites of droppable items. It took me a fair few hours and close inspection to even realise they weren't even sprites, they're that well done, and is a nice repreive from having too many sprites turning to face you at all times. My biggest complaint is not being able to select levels to replay once you've finished them, as not even the intended cheatcodes work, and would require you to literally start from the beginning to see anything again.\n\nAll in all, I can't recommend this game enough. If you liked Duke Nukem and games of that style/era, this game has plenty to keep you entertained.","February 8","true","16.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Forget your slow-♥♥♥ baby shooters, this is a game for manly macho men. Players familiar with the original Duke Nukem 3D and even the old DOOM will no doubt enjoy this fast-paced shooter. For you youngins who grew up on Call of Duty and Battlefield, buckle the ♥♥♥♥ up and get ready for one hell of a crazy ride.\n\nUnlike most modern shooters, the original Shadow Warrior is fast-faced and in your face. From the very moment you start the game, you're bombarded with enemies. Not ready? Too bad. You're dead. If you survive the initial encounter, you'll find yourself in an open-ended albeit still linear succession of rooms. Rather than long, linear corridors, you're given a more open ended back with which to familiarise yourself and explore as you progress through the level.\n\nCombat is fast and fluid, with a wide variety of weapons to obliterate your foes. And if you run out of ammo? Go find some. It's up to you to find more either through exploration. Don't worry too much if you can't find any, though. The sword is extremely fun to use, and kills many enemies in a single hit.\n\nAs for the story... there isn't one. If you have a good sense of humour, you'll get a chuckle out of the game's overt and offensive jokes.\n\nIn the Classic Redux version, you also get the Wanton Destruction and Twin Dragon expansion packs in addition to some optional updated visuals and a remixed main theme.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ameriken/recommended/225160/","ameriken","Ken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ameriken/","511 products in account","Shadow Warrior is a true classic in the FPS genre. Forget your slow-♥♥♥ baby shooters, this is a game for manly macho men. Players familiar with the original Duke Nukem 3D and even the old DOOM will no doubt enjoy this fast-paced shooter. For you youngins who grew up on Call of Duty and Battlefield, buckle the ♥♥♥♥ up and get ready for one hell of a crazy ride.\n\nUnlike most modern shooters, the original Shadow Warrior is fast-faced and in your face. From the very moment you start the game, you're bombarded with enemies. Not ready? Too bad. You're dead. If you survive the initial encounter, you'll find yourself in an open-ended albeit still linear succession of rooms. Rather than long, linear corridors, you're given a more open ended back with which to familiarise yourself and explore as you progress through the level.\n\nCombat is fast and fluid, with a wide variety of weapons to obliterate your foes. And if you run out of ammo? Go find some. It's up to you to find more either through exploration. Don't worry too much if you can't find any, though. The sword is extremely fun to use, and kills many enemies in a single hit.\n\nAs for the story... there isn't one. If you have a good sense of humour, you'll get a chuckle out of the game's overt and offensive jokes.\n\nIn the Classic Redux version, you also get the Wanton Destruction and Twin Dragon expansion packs in addition to some optional updated visuals and a remixed main theme. That's plenty of content for the price, and whether you're an old school hardcore shooter fan or a newcomer looking for a faster, more difficult experience, you should find something to love in Shadow Warrior.","December 25, 2014","true","2.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joenis/recommended/225160/","joenis","HeyManNiceShot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joenis/","168 products in account","Played this game, then there was the "redux" thing with some changes.\n\nIn Shadow Warrior, you play as Lo Wang (yes, that's type of humor here - it's like the sort of puns you get from a cheesy Arnold movie except Ninja-themed, so if that'll ruin the game for you to begin with, let's get that out of the way). He is a a ninja that finds fortune cookies and wields a katana. He is so badass he can kill himself by punching a wall.\n\nIt's not right for me, really, to want to compare this game to stuff like Duke 3D and Doom because it's just not part of that era. It was released in 1997. Quake and Future Shock were already released, Goldeneye was being shown off and going through beta, and Half-Life was right around the corner, just a year later. However, it's a Build engine game, so I feel I should compare it to some degree, and with a positive statement: even though this game's tech was becoming obsolete, they managed to squeeze every drop out of it. Level design is a lot more interesting than much of what I've seen from the time, there's water transparency, bullet marks that stay...things like that. In a sense, it feels like the very end of that era of shooters - where the focus was less on the actual weapons and more on progressing through labyrinths, obtaining keycards (or just keys, or something else that does the same thing) so you can open a series of doors and finally finish the level.\n\nIt's also more challenging than the games I'd compare it to, in my opinion. Not just on a 'normal/hard difficulty is harder than this game's corresponding normal/hard difficulty' level but in a quirky sort of way. In example, the first level of many old shooters have you clear a series of rooms. You can just rush to the exit.\n\nThe first level of this game involves you driving a remote control car (from a remote location) to move a key to a spot where you can pick it up, all from a tiny little screen with a resolution of about 0x0 pixels. I'm not putting that down - that's hilariously awesome, it's just dated.\n\nHowever, it's not so much more difficult than its peers if you go around just swinging the katana all about. I suppose that's what part of the main focus is, but your firearms give the enemies way more of a chance than your blade does.\n\nIt's basically fairly routine for its time though presented in a slightly older format, with elements that go beyond its format. In some weird way, this game may just have been simultaneously behind and ahead of its time.\n\nOne of the things I love about this game and many other 3D Realms games is that for no reason other than adding to the world, you can screw around with things like switches, buttons, ambient vehicles/objects...many, many things you can interact with, down to minute details such as staring into a mirror and having it trigger dialogue where Lo acknowledges he is looking into a mirror at himself. It's stuff that didn't really become commonplace until sprites were not being used to represent characters in FPS games anymore. This is a practice that the developer has not only maintained to this day, but that seems to rub off on developers they publish or license games for. I can think of something like Prey as a good example.\n\nFinally, complaints (of which I don't have much of, as this is a fun game):\n\n*The closest I can come to a HUD option that doesn't take up a ton of the screen is "brief", and that's not quite as descriptive as the full HUD setting. I did not see an option to resize it there - please inform me if there is one.\n\n*Game has reloading. This is redundant because you cannot choose when to reload, leaving you with a magazine that might have like 10% of its ammo left. Should have just not had reloading.\n\n*"Redux" version and yet a rudimentary auto-save system can't be implemented. Seriously? The ability to save whenever is fine in the vast majority of shooters, but it's best if you have both working in tandem with seperate reserved slots and if you're going to do a re-release of an old game like 16 years later, why not implement it?\n\nSo yeah, recommended.","September 19, 2014","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I never played the original game as I wasn't much of a PC gamer growing up. Plus, as far as I know, Shadow Warrior never got a console port. I've only test it out a bit through the free version here on Steam, which I guess can serve as somewhat of a demo if you want to get into it a bit and see what it's like before purchasing this edition.\n\nThe core gameplay is rather simple. You run around killing evil ninjas, sorcerors, and other scary bad guys with a variety of weapons and items. You collect keys and keycards to access new parts of levels while solving some puzzles here and there, and even do some decent platforming. You fight bosses along the way and find a few babes around, especially if you're looking for the secrets. Basically, it's a clone of Duke Nukem 3D with a different setting... and Duke Nukem 3D is a very good game. However there are lots of small differences, like a slightly more advanced engine, enemies that have a few useful tactics to fight, more agile and therefore more deadly foes, and some cool items for you to use. Whereas most of the items in Duke Nukem 3D were secndary passive or activatible things, Shadow Warrior gives you more tactical items, such as spike traps and gas bombs. There are a few interesting weapons, like the shurikens that replace the common pistol and the katana that replaces the bare hand... though you can still use your bare hands if you want. There's also a neat use of vehicles in this game. A bit on the primative side, but a cool touch. Also, replace Duke's comical machoism and action movie hero attitude with a stereotypical Chinese man interpretation... still with some womanizing thrown in.\n\nSo what of this Redux package? Well, it's very much like the Duke Nukem 3D: Megaton Edition package in that includes a lot of content for a good price. And the same people who worked on Megaton are responsible for this as well. Hence their bundle. This version included the main game, plus two expansions, as well as workshop support to play custom levels made by other people. So it's a good amount of levels and playtime. This version also includes controller support, trading cards, achievements, and a version of the original game, though that is already available on Steam for free as I mentioned earlier, just without all the updates to graphics, resolutions, expansions, controller support, cards, or achievements.\n\nHowever, Shadow Warrior Classic Redux hasn't had the same level of attention as Megaton. Both are done by the same devs and I understand they need to manage their time. So time spent on a better selling, more known title like Duke Nukem makes the most sense for making money. Still, the poor advertising and lack of content in the workshop makes it a little disappointing. Plus the muliplayer feature doesn't seem to be coming anymore, which is a real shame. So it's not as impressive of a package. Not as much content, no online, and limited workshop support as of now.\n\nIt's still a very good package nonetheless. If you're a fan of Duke Nukem 3D, you'll probably love this just as much. It's more or less like having more Duke Nukem levels. It has lots of nice conveniences and potential to get more additions in the future, but we'll see. Still, for 10 bucks, this game is a pretty good deal, especially if you're into classic first person shooters. If you're looking at getting Duke Nukem 3D: Megaton Edition, just do yourself a favor and spend the extra few bucks for both. It'll definitely be worth it. Shadow Warrior Classic Redux gets an 8 out of 10 for being a great classic FPS with some extra bells and whistles to spice it up.\n\nAlso... if you're into anime babes and beautiful Asian women... it has some of those too so... ya know... you can just make that a 9 if you fall into that camp but... I thought I'd add that at the end just to keep the rating fair.","March 23, 2015","true","23.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

To answer the that question one must quote the wise words of Lo Wang - "I'd rather kick ♥♥♥ than solve puzzle." or "Ooo lady, who beat you with an ugly stick?"\n\nSo why choose this over the recently made prequel of a similar title? The voice acting and the comedy. The new game is just OK in those areas. The original is hilarious, with a voice that is gruffer and more bearable to listen to while playing and replaying. Comedy wise, this version (the original) is great and offensive. It has great one liners that will make you laugh, where as the new game doesn't have this kind of comedy, due to more restrictions and the media condemning anything that a child might play, even if the suggested age is for mature/adults.\n\nTo wrap this up, the game is a classic and I've personally loved the game since the 90's, and it's been my favorite game since, so I'd recommend this to anyone that wants some action and comedy in their gaming lives.

If you have a historical interest in the genre, you might want to pick it up. If you've played the newer one understand that this one has a very different feel and plays more like duke nukem; you're rewarded (by not losing health) for winning fights fast and efficiently, not by using each weapon once. Also like any classic shooter, there's a few things that aren't conveyed, so here's some tips:\nYou should press the use key on absolutely everything to find secret caches. And shoot gongs. Also punching training dummies gives you health. And the sword kills spawning ghosts instantly.\n\nA word of warning: The game is like 3x as hard without autoaim, and the game is more satisfying with it on. The gun and movement mechanics were designed completely around the assumption that autoaim would be on and the user might not be using a mouse.

It was fairly difficult to get this game working with things like DosBox, and this comes as a blessing (Though SW may have been playable ith eDuke). For those familiar with Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior is more or less the same, but with a new comic target: Asian Movies and Pop Culture. This includes numerous references to John Woo movies, martial arts films, and making fun of "generic Asian accent". It's crude humor and it might come off as offensive or politically incorrect, but I think that simply strengthens the humor from a time when that kind of stuff was funny and people didn't get too riled up about it.\n\nThe action in the game is pretty good, starting you off with a kitana (sword) and a bad guy to slice and dice. Unlike a lot of FPS shooters that relied on 2D 'sprites' for animations, the enemies in this game have different animations for the different ways they can be dispatched. Slash them with a sword, and they'll fall into pieces. Shoot them and they fall, or shoo them in the throat and watch them choak on their own blood before falling down. And of course, explosives cause enemies to blow into lots of red chunks. The weapons are varied and entertaining, with special mention to the sword. You cana lso dual-wield Uzis ("Be proud, Mr. Woo!"), sticky bombs, bodily organs, and a nuke launcher to boot.\n\nLevel wise, there are some creative puzzles and a lot of effects that pushed the aging build engine too its limit. This includes vehicles that can be driven, turrets, boats, remote control cars, and a surplus of new kinds of traps. Many of the levels seem to be set in dojos or cities, and the enemy variety isn't massive. The game has old school boss opponents, but they aren't much to note. Levels are wide open and offer for plenty of exploration on the side to find hidden weapons and power-ups, and with the enemies that do exist, encounters are varied enough and can offer some fun shootouts (or blow-outs).\n\nGet it if you're looking for some fun violence to partake in. I hear multiplayer is coming soon, probably once the glitches with DN3D's Megaton Edition MP issues are cranked out.","April 4, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play as Lo Wang, Shadow Warrior assassin.  Betrayed by your former employer you're out for vengeance.  Where Duke Nukem is a ♥♥♥♥-sure action hero parody, Lo Wang is a dirty old man with even more one-liners than Duke, and he's much more entertaining.  Plus, it has rabbits.  Who doesn't like bunnies?\n\nAs for the game itself, at it's core it's Duke Nukem 3D gone East, so expect the same Build-Engine graphics and sprite-based enemies.  You have your standard gun-toting cannon fodder enemies, and instead of aliens you have supernatural foes from Eastern folklore.  Weapons range from bare fists, katana, shuriken, up to magic weapons such as the guardian head and ripper heart, and high explosives up to and including tactical nuclear missiles!  There are nifty items such as the portable health kit, a smoke bomb to make you invisible, caltrops to stagger and wound your enemies, a very useful gas grenade that slowly chokes them to death, among others.\n\nWhat's great about Shadow Warrior Classic Redux as compared to the free Shadow Warrior Classic is you get the original game ported over to Windows as well as the two mission packs that were never available commercially... one of which was thought to be gone forever until someone found an archive of it.  You have control over FOV, frame rate, vsync, old-style pixelation vs smoothed over textures, and the ease of a native Windows build instead of having to run from Dosbox.  The sound track is an excellent eastern flavor, and unlike the old DOS version it plays from the hard drive.  No CD audio required.  If you like classic run-and-gun shooters this is a must have.","September 20, 2013","true","19.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you have a historical interest in the genre, you might want to pick it up. If you've played the newer one understand that this one has a very different feel and plays more like duke nukem; you're rewarded (by not losing health) for winning fights fast and efficiently, not by using each weapon once. Also like any classic shooter, there's a few things that aren't conveyed, so here's some tips:\nYou should press the use key on absolutely everything to find secret caches. And shoot gongs. Also punching training dummies gives you health. And the sword kills spawning ghosts instantly.\n\nA word of warning: The game is like 3x as hard without autoaim, and the game is more satisfying with it on. The gun and movement mechanics were designed completely around the assumption that autoaim would be on and the user might not be using a mouse.

Check!);\n- There are several episodes for you to play through, including the 4-level shareware episode - death to money-milking early access titles;\n- Most of all, there's a ton of action waiting for you in this remastered version of what is one of the best classic FPS games that defined the gaming era back in 1997 (almost 20 years ago, yikes).\n\nBeing a remastered version, expect to see updated visuals, refined audio and controls, and other tiny details that actually matter in a hectic game like this one. You may initially feel that the whole action is too fast for you to grasp, but once you get used to it, you won't have it any other way.\n\nIf you're a fan of classic first person shooters, the likes of which we don't see much in this age of over-the-top tactical and cinematic shooters, Shadow Warrior Classic Redux is the game that will take you way back to a simpler gaming time. You'll often find it on sale for the price of .99 euro, so you have every reason to give it a try.","March 17","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/recommended/225160/","Lintire","Lintire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/","194 products in account","Shadow Warrior is one of the best FPS games ever made.\n\nThis rerelease of the 3D Realms 1997 classic is the definitive version - it doesn't require DOS Box (which is half-functioning at best), has full resolution and graphical options while keeping completely hands off the original game. If you're going to play a version of Shadow Warrior, this is your best bet.\n\nLike most 2.5D shooters of the era, Shadow Warrior eschews story, character arcs (Though Lo Wang is a charismatic lead), and just about every other modern sensibility in favour of hectic, insanely fast and satisfying gameplay. In a way that's typical for 2.5D shooters, Lo Wang strafes around the levels at a million miles per hour pouring out a machinegun tequila, at a rate that makes returning to modern shooters an absolute chore. They feel like the world's slowest malfunctioning elevator in comparison.\n\nWhere Shadow Warrior stands out isn't just excelling at the gameplay, it's the support material. The level design is some of 3DRealm's best, combining truckloads of recognizable assets with traditional labyrinthine layouts to ensure that you're never bored, never funneled through some patronizingly limited corridor environments, but never lost either. Each room is a landmark, every area instantly recognizable.\n\nAccompanying the fantastic level design is the gorgeous, satisfying weapons on offer - from your own fists to the best flamethrower in a videogame to date. Most weapons have alt fires of varying usefulness; it wavers from halving your own firepower for no reason, to firing a nuclear warhead that will  annihilate everything, yourself included.\n\nIt's from concentrating all its firepower on these aspects to absurd degrees that makes Shadow Warrior so good. No fluff, no mess, just a pure satisfying game.\n\nIt's not perfect. There's low enemy variety, with most just being slightly different coloured versions of each other. There's two well done bosses, but after the initial encounter they spam those bosses to miniboss levels. The final boss isn't even worth mentioning and neither is the ending.\n\nThe Achievements introduced are pathetically token - instead of incentivizing you for pushing the game to its limits, it just rewards you for normal play.\n\nNot least, but last, the expansions are absolute trash. They just reuse assets from the base game constantly, introduced no new items or enemies (recoloured reskins aside) feel like lazy cash-ins through and through, with Twin Dragons in particular filled with advertisements to some long dead modding clan. They're more bang for your buck, but it's a pathetic bang not worth bothering with, that sours the experience as a whole.\n\nBut these are minor quibbles on the glorious ride Shadow Warrior takes you on. If you're in the mood for some of the 90s best, this is one of the best examples - and as Lo Wang says, it's all in the reflexes.","June 18, 2015","true","13.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Some of the old traditions and poor level design hurt the game in the long run. It is fun to go back in time to the early days of FPS and blow some baddies apart. There are some cool and fun weapons. Now the problems. First off, you basically see the same 3 guys for the majority of leves. Since most of the guns are more gimmicky, or explosive, you can't use them for the basic guys. This leads to you basically using the uzis and shotguns for 90% of every level, which is super boring after the 21 levels. More useful guns, like machine guns, miniguns, crossbows, etc, other than just railguns with horrible accuracy, flame gun that runs out of bullets after 1-2 guys, and explosive weapons, would make for a better variety. The game is super racist, but in a fun campy 90's way. The level design is the worst though. It follows the poor and outdated keycard design, where every level you hunt for specific colored keycards or keys to get through a door, then continue to do that till you get through the final door. It gets super repetitive and annoying. I know games back then did this to make the levels look bigger than they were and inflate game time because of all the backtracking and running around. It is annoying though starting a level with 3/4 ways blocked and you go one way, get key, open the next door, go get key, and so on. More variety would have been nice. It also didn't help that sometimes the doors were in the most obtrusive places or required excessive backtracking and remembering where in the level that specific colored door was. This leads to a lot of wasted time running around looking for it. I got lost multiple times. The other part is the poor design of how to get the keys. Instead of making sense where they are, they are in the most random secretive spots. I would spend 10 min looking for one, then check a walkthrough, and see it was behind some random painting in a corner of one room i was supposed to try and interact with, for no reason, or jump through, without an inclination I could, to move forward. For a secret that seems nice, but to force you to get keys that way is just annoying. Or not notice there is a smalle crack in that one of 20 rooms that you have to blow to move on. The worst is with levels you push, that look like they blend in with all the other keyboard button background. Multiple times I would look at a level and press interact while looking at it, only for nothing to happen, and then a walkthrough to tell me I had to push it, so I have to crouch down and maneuver my camera 5 different ways until it will register that I pushed it. A lot of time checking walkthroughs for what tiny little detail you missed that is the only way to progress, or where that one random door was you can't find while running around. More guidance or just better placement of things would have done wonders for the frustration factor. Also the equipment I never once used, like smoke bombs or flash bombs. The inventory management wasn't great and they were too situational to use. The caltrops did absolutely nothing. There are a lot of levels and secrets though, including 2 extra levels. There was literally no story at all.

If you were a fan of Blood, this game lacks of weapon precision plus enemy movement smoothness. Better than DN but worst than Blood, which made a far better use of Ken Silverman's Build.\n\nThe character is indeed the american-asian version of Duke. With a mouth full of cliches, being himself one. It's a fast paced game as were all shooters for the era. The level design is good and not repetitive, but unfortunatelly the enemy movement is not smooth and the precision isn't any better either, so until you have a good control of the keys you'll be shooting to the walls even if the enemies are 3 meters away and moving perpendicular to your sight. Explosive kamikazes round the corner can be exasperating too, forcing you to reload after being killed by a type of enemy that, well, shouldn't exist.\n\nApart of these two bad things all other are positive: Agile game with beautiful levels, challenge everywhere, humour, a good tactical experience (but only from afar) with well settled enemies that will hide when possible, conventional and exotic weapons, tons of secrets and huge final bosses. The two expansions kept the same freshness and fit very well, giving the whole product integrity. The experience won't be ruined by unbalanced changes. After ending the main pack if you liked Shadow Warrior so far, you won't leave Wanton Destruction or Twin Dragon unfinished.\n\nIf you liked DN, you have to try this one. If you enjoyed Blood the flaws on Shadow Warrior will be evident, but will be still enjoyable. It could be better with slight changes, but overall is a decent game which was even better in the time. The openGL does its job by adding the real mouselook, so you don't need to rely on autoaim.\n\n7/10","April 8","true","43.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you like the good old first generation shooters, chances are that you'll like that one, and also that yu'll like the Redux version.","June 11, 2015","true","25.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/225160/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Shadow Warrior Classic Redux is a 2013 remaster or update of an original Shadow Warrior game that came out in 1997, used Build engine and was made by 3D Realms. Or "Lo Wang is Shadow Warrior" if we are to belive what cover of a box said. It's an old-school FPS game and can be descriped as eastern bro of Duke Nukem 3D.\nClassic Redux also includes original DOS version, as well as all two released expansion packs, which are freeware anyway. There is no multiplayer from original. Original had competetive (DM) and cooperative modes, though it uses service which isn't there anymore, so you can't use original. Or at least as far as I am aware.\n\nAs for technical side, there are occasional crashes. They can happen randomly, but mostly when I rushed with katana and would get blown up. Anyway, save often!\nA more serious issue with this release got to be circular ground mines in Twin Dragon expansion. In original they would lay on ground, emitting a beeping sound like sticky bombs. When you come close to them, they will first rise into ground and then explode hard after few seconds, so you have to get into range to activate it and then run away. Sadly, mines are glitched in Classic Redux, they are actually sank into ground, so you can't see them, but painful explosion still happens over ground. If you hear bomb beeping nearby - save and get ready to do some blind work.\n\nThe setting is awesome, while plot is non-existant. You are Lo Wang, an asian pervy old fart, who is Shadow Warrior by the way. Which makes you think that he is a stealth master, but in reality he likes nuclear weapons. He worked for Master Zilla as a bodyguard, until Lo finds out that Zilla's corporations goes as low as using demons to do dirty work, and his code of honor does not approve that. Zilla doesn't want some Wang this way either.\nSo you go around in either villages, temples or even cities and wreck mutants and monsters up. While meeting anime girls randomly. Hm, just like tentacled womans in Duke Nukem 3D, but most of them think that Lo Wang should just go away. They should have released a collab FPS title so we could get tentacled anime babes.\n\nThe game is a lot like Duke Nukem, though it doesn't have as much of city levels. But they are still gimmicky and overdetailed. Like, you can play Panchinko machines. Kinda. Or punch training equpment to regenerate your health without limit like a Shadow Casual. One liners are still funny, though "ancient Chinese secret" pops up too much. There are more cool stuff in it too, like more useful items that include "grenades", though only Gas one is for throwing. Some weapons have few modes which you can change with alt-fire. You can even use occasional vehicle, even though they are rare and kinda suck and have horrible collision.\n\nActually, when I played this last time seriously times ago, I didn't like it so much. It wasn't fun, it seemed like game had too much punishing hitscan. Now I beat this game and had no issue for some reason, it was enjoyable a lot. Strange. Maybe that's because before that I played on Hard (3th skill), while now I played on Normal (2nd skill), maybe the gap between these two is huge. Then again, hard hitscan enemies are always awful idea. Or maybe the mouselook and WASD of Classic Redux made it easier than doing it on keyboard-only of original DOS. Or maybe I just learned that some 90s FPS aren't as awesome as Doom and you have to often retreat and use indirect ways to fight, instead of circle-strafing into every encounter. And if you ever meet Shadow ninja, then you are supposed to immeditly retreat, unless you want to get one-hit-killed.\n\nI mean, you got a Grenade Launcher in this game. In other FPS it's like Rocket Launcher but worse, with arcing grenades. You usually can hit things around corner only if you measure accurately and usually you are just a fool when you can just shoot into face. Not in Shadow Warrior! This bloody thing here has a freaking nuclear radius of explosions. What it means is that it's actually useful to clean rooms around corners, while you don't want to use it to fight face-to-face, as it's weaker than rocket and easily hits you too. Actually, it might be way too good, ammo could be less common.\nI really suggest you to check out Steam Guide of Quick Tips by Joseph Hicks, it really is a good one.\n\nAnd yea, there are also some strange balance and choices, like railgun doesn't have much use and it annoyes me that it shoots misaligned compared to crosshair. Katana is a fun melee weapon that at least instakills most common ninjas. You still look like a fool when swinging it over tougher enemies. Hmmmm, this game would have been better if it had cheesy colorful human ninjas from American stuff instead of mutant-ninjas.\n\nAs for Classic Redux, well, this update comes with some cool stuff, mostly modern controls, widescreen support, renderer and Steam Integration so you can just use Steam Workshop! If you don't like it, DOSBox-supported original is also included.\nIt has a bunch of interesting stuff done in it. Main theme was remixed, though I prefer original. Weapon graphics were tweaked a bit so it doesn't look weird on widescreen, like katana was made longer by looping parts of it. It sure looks better!\nYou can even change if you want shurikens or darts graphics for the second weapon you have. That's because the British version of original game was censored and had darts instead. I would say that darts make more sense in this case as the weapon feels very weak. Well, aside from part where they ricochet off walls. Don't tell me about "it's not bad weapon as you can recover them off walls", the game has problems with vertically when it comes to "use" action, so it's weird and hard to get them all back.\nSadly, some cheats don't work. Mostly level select one. Aw.\n\nAs you expect, like all full versions of a game, it comes with two episodes: Shareware episode "Enter The Wang" made of 4 levels and Full-Game-only "Code of Honor" made of around 18 levels. Shareware episodes uses full version's CD Music instead of MIDI, but the only thing you miss is that one track sounded like nothing in registered version. Heh, you can notice how those Shareware levels were much better than Registered ones. Some probably were dissapoint after purchasing game. First half of Code of Honor isn't particulary hot.\n\nIt also comes with both expansion pack. Both were released for free due to being kinda considered abandoned by that time. Or just too late for party. They were being developed by other companies and publisher didn't feel like investing more, or something.\nTwin Dragon was released in 1997. It kinda had half good levels like Lo Wang's house and fish village, and half of generic levels, like those sewer mazes. Some guess that it wasn't complete release, as there is no new soundtrack like promised. Also, final boss, who is reskin, spamming "there can be only one".\nWanton Destruction was found in 2005. It's really all good stuff, it even reskinned most enemies into humans. Recommended, mhm.\nThey say that they found materials of Deadly Kiss, the third expansion out of three, that was considered being lost. Maybe we will get it some day.\n\nAnd heck, at least this game has awesome boss fight music, unlike Duke Nukem 3D who is a sissy. And Lo Want no sissy! Most of arcade or old gamers know that this is the most important element of any game.\n\nIn the end, outside of some glitches which aren't ruining whole game, it's a pretty good redux of a decent game. Pretty fun. At least on Normal, since it abuses hitscan a bit too much at times for 90s shooter. Even though it didn't bring multiplayer, but these are single-player focused games after all, multiplayer was just for fooling around. Big levels full of secrets ahead!","December 14, 2015","true","14.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The only downside is that it's a pain to figure out how to map the game to a XBox 360 gamepad but you still can make changes to the keyboard and mouse setting which is still pretty good.

Sure, Duke is a funny American action movie parody, but Wang has a lot of potential for poking as much humor at a culture as Duke. Plus, Shadow Warrior is arguably a better game anyway. It's also a much, much, much longer game (there's a joke in there about length and a Chinese guy beating out Duke). You really get your moneys worth out of this; 'Wanton Destruction' has some really awesome level design, 'Twin Dragons' is alright, but forgettable.\n\nI'm gonna keep this short: if you like old-school 90's shooters like Doom and Duke Nukem, this one's right up your alley.","November 2, 2014","true","47.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Like Duke its a product of its time, well not as good as duke but something similar.  The graphics are to be expected for a child of the 90's.  Honestly its technological feat that its still running on modern PC's.  I'd reccomend purchasing it for nostalgia purpose or a desire for retro or just to plain fill the cracks in your library.  Other than that why would you buy this game?  Its up to you.  Just don't blame me and don't expect Halo or Call of duty because this game is seriously dated single player game, with what appears to be a story.","September 13, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There's Duke Nukem, Power Slave, Doom, Blood and finally Shadow Warrior.\n\nThe mechanics between each game are pretty similar: a somewhat interesting protagonist armed to the teeth is confronted by hordes of things determined to slaughter him as he searches large, sprawling levels for keys to progress only hindered now and then by the occasional boss. That sentence could have described any of those games.\n\nI have played all these games to certain degrees but Shadow Warrior is on the better side. It's heavily Asian themed, chock-full of stereotypes and tropes of older Asian/ninja action films. The protagonist, Lo Wang, is honestly more enjoyable to play as than even Duke Nukem so there's that.\n\nThis game is a redux which means it's suited for modern computers. In that regard it does its job with only a few new changes here and there (better OST, smoother graphics) but it's still the same game basically.\n\nI would recommend this to fans of the early 1990s shooters. If you like them you will like this. If you're new to them it is a hit or miss.","September 20, 2015","true","6.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But I was never fond of those grand canyon levels.\n\nIt's a shame Shadow Warrior never caught on as much as the Duke. Sure, Duke is a funny American action movie parody, but Wang has a lot of potential for poking as much humor at a culture as Duke. Plus, Shadow Warrior is arguably a better game anyway. It's also a much, much, much longer game (there's a joke in there about length and a Chinese guy beating out Duke). You really get your moneys worth out of this; 'Wanton Destruction' has some really awesome level design, 'Twin Dragons' is alright, but forgettable.\n\nI'm gonna keep this short: if you like old-school 90's shooters like Doom and Duke Nukem, this one's right up your alley.","November 2, 2014","true","47.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

For it's fun, easy to learn but yet challenging old-school gameplay or all those jokes, eastereggs quotes bei Lo Wang? To be honest - I can't tell. This game was released in the year I was born and I played this game for the first time in 2015. I got this game for free on Steam, because I signed in for the newsletter, when Duke Nukem Forever got released and they sent me Steam codes for this game and Duke Nukem 3D: Megaton Edition.\nBut I only have played this one. I am still pretty terrible at this one. The movement is kind of weird, but my PC or DPI/laser settings could be a problem, but it's also possible, that I am not used to a game like this. Well, what does this game have to offer? Fun and entertaining gameplay, explorable levels with lots of ancient chinese secrets and just a lot of bad guys to shoot at. I finished level 4, so there is still a lot to explore, but after more than 2 hours, I can honestly say that this is a game you shouldn't miss, unless you have a problem with "slightly" outdated visuals or games without a story. But again - this one features a lot of fun and the premise of playing a chinese warrior and not a technician really works out. Personal weapons like the sword, shuriken, dual UZIs, RPG, shotgun and the ripper - only the sky is the limit and the amount of ammo you carry. This game is worth every penny. If you are unsure, get it on sale. If a guy like me, who enjoyed the story mode of CoD:AW appreciated this game, you will too!\n\nClick here for more ancient chinese secrets.","October 6, 2015","true","4.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Great level design? Check. Fun weapons? Check. Lots of content? You bet! Much like Duke Nukem 3d, Shadow Warrior drops you into a series of somewhat maze-like levels, and has you explore them to find your way out. It's a great change of pace from modern shooters, which generally don't give you much room to explore. This release comes with two expansions, and gives you lots of gameplay for your dollar. Highly reccomended.","June 1, 2014","true","18.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The humour, the violence, the easter eggs, it’s all been worth the money.\n\nThe original 1997 version was made by the same developers as Duke Nukem 3D, 3D Realms. So there are many similarities in terms of gameplay. I have to say though, I much rather prefer Shadow Warrior Redux over the recently released Duke Nukem 3D Megaton edition. Both were re-published by Devolver Digital but the gameplay is more addictive and the enemies are more interesting. I might have not played this game when I was a kid, but I still have this sense of nostalgia while playing.\n\nThe inclusion of the original campaign and the two expansion packs means there are plenty of hours to be had out of this game. They’ve even included a user maps section so there will most likely be even more content in the future. The game options, main menu, and in game HUD have all been updated. Now you set your FOV, select an HD resolution, and make various other tweaks to the gameplay.\n\nIt’s a worthy re-release of a clearly popular game and I definitely recommend anyone who grew up playing similar games to take a look at this.\n","July 10, 2013","true","21.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

It was very much worth it. It lived up to it's reputation (although it didn't really have any). I'd say the 2013 version is better because Lo Wang has a better character. + there's Hoji. This is still a great game though.\n\nIt's suprising that this game doesn't have the same amount of hype Duke 3D has though. Even though this game is Duke 3D's little brother, it's miles better than that game. Although that may be because I didn't like Duke 3D. If you ask me, that's one of the most overrated games ever made. It has nothing going for it except the character itself. Duke's level of profanity is something else (although this Shadow Warrior also has a lot of kinky jokes).\n\nThe fun thing about this game is that it gives you lots of powerful weapons, which you get to use very frequently. E.g. you get to use the rocket launcher particularly lot. It's not just something you save for bossfights. But even the simpler weapons, like the shurikens and the sword remain highly useful until the very end of the game and it's a lot of fun to use themThe one I used the least is probably the sticky bombs, because those are a bit of a hassle (enemies might get close to you by the time they explode). Then there's fun stuff, like shooting fireballs from a severed demon head, Ripper heart which creates op clones of yourself AND AN ACTUAL F*CKING NUKE!\n\nI also played through the Twin Dragon expansion. It was worth it. That expansion had lots of interesting maps, although the final battle was a bit... anti-climatic (remember Doom 2's original final boss level? yeah kinda like that).\n\nThere are even anime references in it (Slayers, Sailor Moon). Then there' stuff from warious movies and games (like Mortal Kombat and Lara Croft)\n\nOh and the invisible ninjas are the best enemies ever invented. Not too tanky, but stacked with damage. They have insanely powerful fireball spells, which usually insta-kill. Sounds OP, but this creates great high-tension clutch play moments and the game gives you similarly op tools to kill them. When you encounter this ninja, I just get this adrenaline rush that a lot of games fail to give me these days. This is how monster design is done! "If everything is op, nothing is op!"\n\nBuy this instead of Duke 3D. Much more worth it.","August 16, 2015","true","25.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, as someone who played Shadow Warrior's close relatives Doom and Duke Nukem 3D (both as a kid and recently) but is only playing this now, I can't really recommend it. My problem with the game boils down to this - the other two games I mentioned, and others like Heretic, work perfectly well and are fun to play even if you never find a single secret because they flow well and are laid out intuitively. Their hidden areas and items are rewards for going out of your way that you're happy to look for because you're enjoying yourself. In Shadow Warrior finding these hidden areas is often mandatory to proceeding (usually with vital keys hidden this way) and even if you're looking for them anyway, one will still frequently be left standing there thinking "...okay, so what now?" which can really break the flow. This is to say nothing of those parts where you need to mess around with the physics puzzles, which have aged like a fine milk. As part of the "Hardcore, oldskool sprite-based shooters" gang it's still head and shoulders above a Modern Military Shooter, for example, but when compared to many of its peers it stands on much shakier ground. If what I described sounds like heaven to you, then it probably is, but maybe save this one until you're bored of better games like it.","January 20, 2015","false","5.5"," 20 of 47 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","20","47","0","0"

I got to LIKE THIS GAME! It's so much like Duke Nukem Meltdown with the same corny one-liners with Duke going Ninja on us with a NICE BIG SWORD!\n\nI gotta love it... I gotta love it... I gotta...... (Sob... sniff... sounds of me blowing my nose.) I CAN'T!!! I finally scream to myself in frustration.\n\nShadow Warrior Classic Redux was made on the exact engine Duke Nukem Meltdown for the Playstation was made on. Compair them, The graphics and resolution are exactly the same along with the controls. Even the ammo bar on the bottom of the screen is exactly the same. Though the controls did get slightly more complex because this was made ofter Meltdown and there were a few new weapons like smoke bombs, gas bombs and the RPG now had ammo that could be powered up.\n\nNow I could beat Meltdown ramped up to the highest difficulty. It wasn't easy but it is just possible if you save often and were careful as hell. NOT WITH Shadow Warrior. This game was killing me off like a baby on just normal! I hate dialing a game back to easy because to me the average Joe should be able to beat a game on normal. The main problem with Shadow Warrior versus Meltdown is visual enemies. Half of them just blend too well into the background. You can't hit what you can't see, especially when it flies and moves choppily. Meltdown suffered this too every once in a while but with Shadow Warrior it felt more like the norm. Meltdown planned around it. Shadow Warrior felt like it said- 'Me no care, you die now.'\n\nI really wanted to like this game. The humor is killer but unfortunately the game was killed by it's very difficulty. I can't enjoy the humor much when I can't live long enough half the time to hear it.\n\nRecommend this game? I sorely want to say yes so bad... But as bad as this game is, it's worse to play and on that note, no.","November 10, 2015","false","1.1"," 1 of 12 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","12","0","3"

I'll give a full list in a second of what's good and bad, but seriously, it's one of those games that's so bad it's almost you have to experience it regardless of people's advice against it, like Duke Nukem Forever.\n\nSo basically:\n\n- The level design varies from pretty neat in places to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful, sometimes leaving situations where you can find every secret in the map before you find the actual path you're supposed to take, because the paths seem to be so contrived you have to play a walkthrough to even understand where the f**k the next master key/card key/door/button is.\n\n- Some sections you'll be going through interesting levels such as aeroplanes, malls, villages, temples. Other times you will be presented with warehouses and factories that all look pretty generic.\n\n- Some characters look ok, but a majority of the late-game characters, it's like what the f*@k am I even looking at. I still don't know. Gorilla demon something comes to mind, but there are about 3 different forms of gorilla demon something.\n\n-I'd say about 25% of weapons are good, the rest seem the kind of weapon that was cut from Duke Nukem 3D for being too boring. You spend a majority of the game defaulting to either a riot gun (which is ok, if a little overpowered) or dual uzis. It isn't that ninja. The sword is immense though. I love first person swording.\n\n- Some weapons seem to be planning to kill you rather than the enemy (you need decent capability to skillfully deploy sticky bombs for example, or to judge the blast radius of the nuclear warhead rocket launcher).\n\n- Some weapons are rendered pointless when a better weapon is picked up, are generally ineffective or just with no use in the world the AI and the player character inhabit.\n\n-The AI are intelligent enough to circumvent basically all your trap weapons and equipment (this might just be Sod's Law in play though).\n\n-Half the equipment is either ineffective or pointless, or so ridiculously good it makes certain terrain a formality. The gas bomb can destroy an entire building of boss-tier enemies if you throw it in said building. Other equipment (caltrops, namely) does nothing but annoy enemies, which is completely pointless, since 90% of all the other weaponry insta-kills them in a single shot. One piece of equipment (flash bomb) does nothing but make you "partially invisible" and every time I have used the said piece of equipment, the enemies haven't changed their behaviour at all. All that happens is my first person sprite turns translucent!\n\n-I started questioning my life after a while because the game just kept going. You get to your boss guy's house, and he's not there. You destroy his entire business assets. Hours pass. Then finally you fight him, and then he pisses off at the end and you have to spend another entire game worth of levels chasing him to finally beat him. The second "game"-section thing is also superior, so you can save yourself some time and just do that section. Value for money though.\n\n-This might just be me whining, but the graphics cause some weird motion sickness with me. Considering I play Doom and Duke Nukem 3D all the time and have not experienced this before now, it's quite odd. This might just be a medical problem I have though...\n\n-Some of the humour is so stale, it seems to have decomposed into what some may describe as cringeworthy, or just racist. It's definitely got some beef with the asian stereotype. Like some major beef. Like a beef farm worth of beef.\n\n-Some of the referential humour flew over my head, and I've watched a lot of the subject matter it mentions.\n\n-It has an unhealthy obsession with naked/semi-naked Sailor Moon sprites.\n\n-I do like the menu and achievement art style though. That's nice.\n\nThis is like the reverse to the Duke Nukem series. The new one is better! Go play that. I couldn't recommend that more and un-no-recommend this one less. Although you may want to buy it just to be impressed at how bad it is. You can still get some good gameplay out of it to be fair. But it's pretty limited. Also factor in how easily offended you are by the kind of poor humour in play here.\n\nIt makes Mortal Kombat look socially conscious, they don't employ the "me rikey velly much" route of humour.\n\nBut saying that, still a better game than Postal 2.  Christ, that games garbage.","August 22, 2014","false","14.5"," 11 of 42 people (26%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","26","11","42","0","0"

Stale.\n\nThis is an update to a 1997 game, which a) makes it mostly work on current systems, b) gives it a modern, usable menu and, most importantly, c) modern controls. Seriously, grab the old one somewhere (or the original Duke Nukem, it's the same engine) and try to play it. Do some typical maneuvres like a quick 180-turn or a strafe-jump. Pan the camera upwards, notice the distorted perspective. You'll feel the difference. FPS games have improved much in these 17, yes, SEVENTEEN years since its release (writing this in 2014). It's still a bit unstable, crashing on a quicksave sometimes, doesn't work in some resolutions, but generally serviceable.\n\nBut the humour, the one-liners and the blatant, silly racism is just so antiquated and cringeworthy today, Might have been funny back then, and might still be if you're 12. But I'm glad we moved past classifying this as actual entertainment.  For comparison, the original Duke Nukem is just as bad, but riffs on 80s action movies, so way less racism, way more machoism and sexism.\n\nTLDR: play for research purposes only.

Period. From a nostalgic standpoint? Yeah, I can see its appeal. However...\n\n... maybe I'm in the minority, but I don't like it even as a trip down memory lane. Maybe because I have no memories of this kind of arcadey FPS. I began my FPS career with "Medal of Honor" on PS1, in 1999. That was 2 years after this game's release. The difference is vast, mainly in approach.\n\nOld video presentation (aka graphics) aside, "Shadow Warrior" features:\n- a character that moves faster than the Flash; you tap a directional key and you're flying all over the map\n- confusing level design, a simple A to B mess\n- loads of dumb enemies that just sort of rush at you\n\nAll these characteristics are basically shared by all of the so-called FPS classics, the arcade shooters. It seems these just aren't my cup of tea. If you're like me, I guess chances are you won't be liking it, too.","January 10, 2015","false","3.1"," 1 of 23 people (4%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","4","1","23","2","6"

What makes it different is that instead of playing as Duke Nukem, it's Lo Wang, and instead of aliens who came to Earth, it's the supernatural lackeys of Zilla. Classic Redux includes not only the main game but also it's expansions, Wanton Destruction and Twin Dragon. Only difference between the Expansions is that one ties up the loose end (with some reskinned enemies) from the main game while the other has Lo Wang go against his own brother.\n\nPros: As said, it comes with the expansions\nPlays like Duke Nukem 3D, in a first-person mode where its just gunning down bad-guys\nGood variety weapons, from fist and sword to rocket launcher and a severed demon (or orc? It is green.) head.\n\nCons: In some levels, you might get lost, wondering where to go to next.\nThe final bosses can be disappointing, especially if you are familiar with the way they fight.\nMight offend some due to the Asian stereotypes (One of the enemies in the expansions can offend some due to how they look and/or sound).\n\n\nIf you are partial to FPS games, especially those similar to Doom and Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior can give you a bang for your buck.","November 23, 2014","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're not familiar with what this game is about just think of a racist asian steriotype of Duke Nukem and there you go. For its time this was a pretty great use of the BUILD engine and there is a lot of fun to be had here. After not playing this for over a decade it is definitely nice to see how far FPS have come since this. The level design and settings are creative, and theres plenty of enemy types and weapons to keep you entertained. My only complaint after 15 or so years is still the same... this game is brutally difficult, even on normal setting. As with many sprite based games using the build engine... the hit detection is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥. My advice is to turn off the crosshair and turn on auto-aim for a less frustrating experience. The enemies you face have pinpoint accuracy from any distance... while you can unload two full uzi clips at an enemy 10 feet away and hit absolutely nothing. The riot gun functions similarly and its spread makes it utterly ineffective without autoaim. The game wasn't quite ready for full 3d aiming yet and like many of the great sprite based FPS of the times it really shows. Beyond that it's worth a pick up for nostalgic fans and fans of old school FPS.\nOn a side note... I just noticed that the person playing in the trailer on the steam store page is using GOD mode and running all over blowing ♥♥♥♥ up... just note that that is NOT how you play this game lol. If you run in guns blazing thinking this is DOOM or something like that you will be annihilated. Even the basic evil ninja demon things can take you down in a matter of seconds if you're not careful.","January 11, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But if you can make it past all the racism, you will find a very solid FPS. 3D Realms took what thay did in Duke Nukem 3D and make it 10 times better. The weapons are unique, the action is fast paced, the enemies are challenging and the level design is mostly flawless.

In stead of feeding you a seemingly infinite number of enemies coming down one corridor for you to take out with a variety of guns that do excactly the same thing, this gives you a maze loaded with secrets, various distinctly different enemies, inspired weapons and cheesy one-liners. Which is nice. But I can explain very easily what this game is, it's an old shooter. Everybody knows what those are like, they are mostly the same. I have to say that this game is a lot better than for example Doom or Duke Nukem, but those are the details. The point is that this is a 2D-sprite fighting action packed piece of handsome that just throws insanely hard mazes at you. No puzzles, no story, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Just Pure action. They focused their resources at making cool weapons and splendid levels, not expensive scripts or realistic CGI. Which also rules. But, it's old.

You can tear through enemies with a katana while spouting a quirky one-liner, punch people to death, gun them down, blow them up and much more. There are also items, such as night-vision goggles, to aid you. You'll need all the help you can get fighting the enemies in this game, because they can get rather difficult.

It's very much an old game and the Classic Redux improves on the graphics slightly. While playing this at times I felt a little motion sick but other times alright. I must warn you that this game is very hard, infact some levels are very maze like and each bad guy can easily kill you if youre not paying attention, Also save often, Back in the 90's these games didn't have auto save. It's alot of fun and excellent for anyone who loves the classic FPS's it's got great jokes, references to Kung-fu movies and tv shows and is really perverted at times, but also very gorey. It's great for anyone looking to go back in time and enjoy some older FPS's rather than the modern day run of the mill call of duty.","July 10, 2013","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Much is the same here as I mentioned in my Duke Nukem Megaton Edition review options wise, new graphic options and optimizations for newer hardware have been added that make it nice and easy to play and get working. It includes what I assume is all the Shadow Warrior Classic chapters, I can't say for sure having never played it thoroughly before. A nice thing about this game is does some unique things compaired to other shooters that came out around its time. For example, the melee weapon in this game, which is a sword, is actually a really useful and powerful weapon as opposed to being the "last resort" option for when you run out of ammo for guns.\n\nNot to say the guns aren't good in this, the guns are pretty great and there is good variety to them. Speaking of guns, a lot of the guns in this game have alternate fire modes (the rocket launcher has 3 :D), which is something you didn't really see much in other classic shooters. The game is also pretty tough, I had a rough time even on the normal difficulty level, but I enjoy the challange so its definitely not a mark against it or anything. I highly recommed this for shooter fans, its a blast.","March 17, 2014","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a young lad I played the shareware version of the original Shadow Warrior many, many times. The opening four levels that comprise what is now known as "Enter the Wang" represent to me a high point in classic shooters. Shadow Warrior was the logical evolution of the kind of gameplay pioneered by Duke Nukem 3D. It was no longer enough simply to have big guns, explosions and ludicrous gibs, no, you must also have interactive environments and a smartass protagonist offering witty, post-kill one liners! And so did 3D Realms deliver. Together with Duke and Monolith's horror-flavored FPS, Blood, Shadow Warrior forms the holy trinity of Build Engine FPSs. Shadow Warrior is in most respects a superior game to Duke, with more potent weapons, smarter level design and improved world details- many objects that were 2D sprites in Duke are now 3D models, albeit blocky. You are Lo Wang,  raunchy, east-asian pastiche, professional mercenary, and wise-cracking old master, on a quest to exact revenge on the evil Orochi Zilla and his army of gun-toting demons. At your disposal is an arsenal of ballistic, explosive, and outright magical weaponry, and you will need it all to survive the game's punishing difficulty. Shadow Warrior, like most FPSs of the era, is not an easy game, but it is an entertaining one. This rerelease also includes both the game's expansions, Wanton Destruction and Twin Dragon. If you enjoy this game, I recommend moving on directly to Flying Wild Hog's excellent remake.","July 18, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The weapons in this game really pack a punch, and are a blast to use. The maps are fun and challenging, with lots of clever secrets hidden all around. The humour in this game is crude (sometimes offensive), but it fits the theme of the game, and some of it actually made me laugh.\n\nMy first complaint are that some levels are impossible to complete without a walkthrough if you're on your first playthrough, usually because some of the keys and switches are hidden waaay too well, in fact some are harder to find than most of the ACTUAL hidden secrets in the game. My second complaint is that the bosses are extremely lame (two of them become regular enemies, though), and only require spamming a powerful weapon to take them down while running in circles, but the worst boss was the final boss, who was dissapointing and incredibly easy.\n\nAll in all though, it's a really fun game, and I highly recommend it if it's on sale!","November 25, 2013","true","24.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very much an old game and the Classic Redux improves on the graphics slightly. While playing this at times I felt a little motion sick but other times alright. I must warn you that this game is very hard, infact some levels are very maze like and each bad guy can easily kill you if youre not paying attention, Also save often, Back in the 90's these games didn't have auto save. It's alot of fun and excellent for anyone who loves the classic FPS's it's got great jokes, references to Kung-fu movies and tv shows and is really perverted at times, but also very gorey. It's great for anyone looking to go back in time and enjoy some older FPS's rather than the modern day run of the mill call of duty.","July 10, 2013","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In stead of feeding you a seemingly infinite number of enemies coming down one corridor for you to take out with a variety of guns that do excactly the same thing, this gives you a maze loaded with secrets, various distinctly different enemies, inspired weapons and cheesy one-liners. Which is nice. But I can explain very easily what this game is, it's an old shooter. Everybody knows what those are like, they are mostly the same. I have to say that this game is a lot better than for example Doom or Duke Nukem, but those are the details. The point is that this is a 2D-sprite fighting action packed piece of handsome that just throws insanely hard mazes at you. No puzzles, no story, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Just Pure action. They focused their resources at making cool weapons and splendid levels, not expensive scripts or realistic CGI. Which also rules. But, it's old.

The Uzis are good for fast enemies and the missile launcher and grenade launcher can blow up enemies to pieces.\n-Maps are maze like with keycards to open the next area. It never gets confusing and I never had to look up a walkthrough to find out where to go.\n-FOV slider\n-Great environments from ancient Japan like levels to Japanese towns.\n-The graphics are appealing\n-When you blow up an enemy his body parts fly in the air.\n-Some weapons have an alternative fire. For example the riot gun can fire one shell or 6 shells consecutively. You can fire 2 Uzis or one. You can use regular missiles or heat sinking missiles (with a power up) or a nuke. This would be used in Half Life which came out the following year.\n\nCons\n-Sometimes your grenade launcher will make fire on the ground where you have to backtrack and you will occasionally take damage from touching it.\n-The default mouse controls are awful but can be fixed by changing the X-axis scale and Y-Axis scale.\n-Every single line out of Lo Wang is a joke referring to his giant wang. He gets annoying quickly. You basically play as an old bad ♥♥♥ pervert. Also he speaks in broken English. You can always turn off his voice though.\n-The story is not really that good. Yes this is a 90's game but it came out a year before Half Life.\n\nThis is the last game 3d Realms developed before Duke Nukem Forever. It is a great goodbye to the end of an era of old school shooters. If you liked Duke Nukem you might like this game. I say might because I think Duke is a more appealing character for some reason. Whatever the case, Shadow Warrior Classic Redux has great level design, great weapons with alternative fire, and plenty of secrets to find.","January 9","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only with some real improvements.  The weapons in this game are more varried, and include some staples of later games that originated here (Sticky Bombs, Railgun).  The katana makes a wonderful melee weapon in this.  Other weapons range from shurikens to a missle launcher with a little bit of extra oomph.\n\nThe engine was also enhanced.  Free-moving vehicles (though other games, such as Necrodrome, had those before this, and the vehicles in this are literally build as part of the stage, just the floor elevated), water you could see - and shoot - into, level on level 3D.\n\nAs for the story, it's pretty basic 90's FPS fare.  Threadbare but enough to get you through the game.  Level designs are fun and in some places quite nice to look at (for the time).  The expansion packs are both mostly more of the same.  The updated engine allows this game to run better on modern machines, including wide screen support etc.\n\nThere are problems.  No multi-player is featured in this.  And we are still missing the unreleased expansion, Deadly Kiss, despite supposedly having the assets available to them.  But for the most part, it's a fun retro FPS.","October 7, 2015","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Corporations rule every facet of life in a near-future Japan and employ Shadow Warriors, one-man armies of unparalleled skill, to protect their power" - Shadow Warrior Classic Redux.\n\nI've always been a fan of the old 90's shoot em up games. I remember Duke Nukem, Shadow Warrior and Doom 1+2 as fun and exciting games where level design and graphics blew my mind. Now we are so lucky to get remastered version on all of these game and yes I still enjoy them!\n\nShadow Warrior Classic Redux gives you a lot of content. 2 base episode + 2 expansion episodes. Each episode has around 10-20 levels. Each level is designed well and feels open with different paths. The maps are big and filled with secrets and easter eggs (which I love). Graphics looks good and it runs easily with 400 fps. The game itself launches without problems and doesn't crash at all. Widescreen support is also very handy! The gameplay is fun and exciting. It plays like Duke Nukem and Doom where you have to get to exit on each map. Find keys to unlock doors, solve puzzles and defeat many different enemies on your path with a big arsenal of guns (smgs, shotguns, rpg's, katana etc.). The game might be hard for someone unfamiliar with old school shooters, so don't rush it. You need all them health packs and armour pickups ;)\n\nIf you are a big fan of the old games and just wanna have a nostalgic feeling, buy this game! It's cheap and offers a lot of content. The game got humour, gore, run and gun, big maps, a vast of different enemies and guns, secrets and most important it offers a lot of fun!\n\nGet hyped for Shadow Warrior 2! :D","January 2","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Uzis are good for fast enemies and the missile launcher and grenade launcher can blow up enemies to pieces.\n-Maps are maze like with keycards to open the next area. It never gets confusing and I never had to look up a walkthrough to find out where to go.\n-FOV slider\n-Great environments from ancient Japan like levels to Japanese towns.\n-The graphics are appealing\n-When you blow up an enemy his body parts fly in the air.\n-Some weapons have an alternative fire. For example the riot gun can fire one shell or 6 shells consecutively. You can fire 2 Uzis or one. You can use regular missiles or heat sinking missiles (with a power up) or a nuke. This would be used in Half Life which came out the following year.\n\nCons\n-Sometimes your grenade launcher will make fire on the ground where you have to backtrack and you will occasionally take damage from touching it.\n-The default mouse controls are awful but can be fixed by changing the X-axis scale and Y-Axis scale.\n-Every single line out of Lo Wang is a joke referring to his giant wang. He gets annoying quickly. You basically play as an old bad ♥♥♥ pervert. Also he speaks in broken English. You can always turn off his voice though.\n-The story is not really that good. Yes this is a 90's game but it came out a year before Half Life.\n\nThis is the last game 3d Realms developed before Duke Nukem Forever. It is a great goodbye to the end of an era of old school shooters. If you liked Duke Nukem you might like this game. I say might because I think Duke is a more appealing character for some reason. Whatever the case, Shadow Warrior Classic Redux has great level design, great weapons with alternative fire, and plenty of secrets to find.","January 9","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's nice that they made an upgraded version for the newer computers. The black text are the spoilers of the story.\nYou play as Lo Wang, a bodyguard of Zilla Enterprises that has control over every major industry in Japan. But then master Zilla wants to conquer Japan the evil way so Lo Wang quits his job. After that Zilla orders creatures to attack Lo because he is a threat to their industry. They kill his old master, Leep and he promises to avenge his master. He defeats Zilla but he manages to escape.\n\nDo I recommend it? Yes, it a really good game to have if you love the older games, or if you wanna make an oldschool game collection on Steam.\nHow would I rate it? 8/10, it has some glitches that can affect the game, but they can be fixed.","April 6","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Prepare for running in maze-like levels where you could spend hours stuck on a single level untill you get a sudden jolt of inspiration or get plain lucky while investigating random spot around the level. And no matter how good you are at quest fps games, you WILL feel like a complete idiot from time to time for not getting what the game wants from you; and when you find the solution, you'll either pat yourself on the back for the job well done, facepalm hard for not seeing something obvious or rip your hair out in anger, swearing to murder devs for putting a keycard in a really obnoxious place with no buttons/levers/enemies/hints or any other indication that it was there (thanks for not telling me it was half a meter away from you, tech girl.
