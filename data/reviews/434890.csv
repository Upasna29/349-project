The great thing about Eight Mini Racers is how pure the actual racing is.\n\nI played multiple races against a friend and really had some fun races.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=624195306\n\nThere are sixteen tracks varying from a simple loop to some quite complex circuits that involve you crashing through tyre walls and weaving left and right.\n\nI can imagine this is going to be a great example of for every player you add in the mix the game becomes amazingly more fun.  I can't imagine how great it would be with 6-8 friends!!  Obviously with it being local only, arranging this is going to only some can manage.  But four-players would still be awesome!\n\nThe price tag refelects the simplicity of the game but if you have some local friends that enjoy simple top-down racers this represents amazing value!","February 14","true","0.6"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","15","23","0","0"

It's in the title, "Eight Mini Racers")\n+ Has fun powerups and... powerdowns?\n+ Has a ton of colors for each car\n\nCons:\n- Only has one volume option (Master Volume)\n- You can only connect by LAN (Local Connection)\n- Only has 3 cars\n- No AI racers for singleplayer\n- Singleplayer gets repetative after a while since you're the only one on the track\n\nOverall I rate it an 8/10\nIt's worth playing, and definitly worth the price! Again, it's localized multiplayer ONLY, so if you're looking for an online multiplayer option, there is none.\n(Sorry, I'm very bad at writing reviews, lol, please don't criticize me too much ;D)","January 12","true","5.8"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","10","16","4","0"
