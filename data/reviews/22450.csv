The interaction between the characters is strong, stronger than most, with each having more inward depth than your typical "action heroes" in fantasy, and E'lara especially is one ofthe few female elven characters who isn't simply a flighty songbird who needs help constantly, without going into the super-strong "I am a man with boobs" territory.\nGameplay is third person action/shooter, each character has a melee weapon with shield, and ranged weapon, with E'lara's ranged being stronger and Caddoc's melee being stronger. Melee is the weakest part of the gameplay, but the graphics, exploration and side quest aspects, character interaction, and general story is fairly strong. One or two quick sequences ruin parts of the game, like running from a giant spider where you only have a two second window to evade it or die instantly, and have to do multiple short sequences...\nBut it is otherwise a very good game, worth a playthrough, and Bethesda/Zenimax are one of the few publisher/developer combos worthy of your money anymore.

It's not amazing, but I would say it's very competent. It succeeds at accomplishing exactly what it aims to: Create a cool game with an interesting world and compelling co-op mechanics. The characters are intriguing and often funny. The game doesn't hand-hold much, especially on side quests. The game is difficult, punishingly so. This game will kick both your asses, and you will be so tempted to drink the sleg. I recommend against it.\n\nAlso wins the award for having a completely meaningless title.

Although the game lacks a bit on the graphics side, it's still charming and have a very well built and beautiful scenery. The very atmospheric aesthetic of the game is very pleasing and will make up for the sharp polygons and not so great textures. The gameplay is simple, solid and straight to the point, you can change between the two main characters from time to time. You can customize for magic or melee, and which type of each along the way, constructing a more ideal personal play style that you enjoy more. The dialogue in this game is simply amazing, very well crafted, character building is also great, the relationship between the two are very fun and funny to watch, and it doesn't get in the way of the gameplay, you don't need to stop playing to watch a boring 5 minutes cutscene all the time, the dialogue is short and well spaced in-between throughout the game and also happens as you play, really smart game design. The story is great and captivating, and the dark fantasy theme really draws you in into the game's lore. And depending of your playstyle and choices you make throughout the game, the ending veries, this is really, really cool.\n\nThe game feels epic and plays epic. The dialogues and superb voice acting will make a very fond memory. If you love the dark fantasy genre and good and fun combat mechanics and a smart game design in general, Hunted: The Demon's Forge will give you an epic time.","June 27, 2014","true","22.5"," 42 of 45 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","42","45","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/22450/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2818 products in account","Hunted: The Demon’s Forge is an action hack and slash game. Developed by inXile Entertainment and published by Bethesda, releasing on PS3, Xbox 360 and PC in Mid-2011.\n\nGameplay in Hunted can be done either single player or co-op, whether it is online, or split screen. You play as either E’lara or Caddoc. E’lara specialises in using range weapons whilst Caddoc is the sword and board of the pair. Both of the characters have access to casting spells but these play a smaller part in the combat than you would think due to mana constraints. The hack and slash type combat system is really fun, and the range combat is even better. As you kill enemies they will drop fragments of shards, collect enough shards and you will get a skill point. You can use the skill point to purchase new abilities and upgrade the abilities as well. By the end of the game you will more or less have all of the skills so it doesn’t matter too much which you pick initially.  If you are playing the game solo, you have the option at checkpoints to change which character you are in control of. In general, the computer AI is fairly intuitive at using your partner, helping you in battle etc.\n\nI played Hunted on 4k, with graphics ramped up to max, and it does look really good. The environments you are fighting in, the backdrops and character models all look very impressive. What I was a little let down by is the animation. It just seems to of been done very lazily, using the wrong animation at the wrong time, such as when you are moving through a narrow hole that has nothing above your head, the animation that is used, is clearly just the stock “Generic animation when moving through object” as the characters will show hand movements as if they are holding objects above their head. It just felt really sloppy and looked very unprofessional at times. Other than the animation, the visuals department of Hunted is better than average.\n\nWhilst the game has voice acting, the male actor doesn’t quite hit the right notes for me. Feels very generic meat head style and sometimes the words don’t quite match up with the character’s mouth so again, an animation issue.  E’lara’s voice actor is slightly better, but again the issue with animation crops up again. Sound effects for weapons are really good though. Soundtrack is somewhat forgettable, even now after just completing the game, no music seems to have stood and stuck in my head.\n\nI started out the game on the medium difficulty level and found that to be too easy, so I restarted and put the difficulty on the max setting, and this really does give you a challenge. You really have to make use of every single potion drop, every ounce of mana and above all else, make use of your characters roll ability. I can’t help but think it would still have been really easy had I been playing with another person rather than the AI though.\n\nWhilst you are exploring the dungeons, caves and fortresses, you will find weapon wracks, depending on which character you are in control of, if you destroy said weapon wrack, you will get a piece of loot which is relevant for your character, so E’lara will usually get a bow, and Caddoc will usually find a sword or shield. The looting aspect of the game is probably one of my favourites, because well; who doesn’t like loot in games? Whilst the weapons and armour don’t have massive amounts of variety on, you normally only get two stats. For your bow it is usually speed and damage, same for swords but you can also get armour plated shoulder pads which adds a bit extra armour stat on for your character.\n\nI finished Hunted in just over nine hours.  I found that to be an acceptable length, whilst I wasn’t bored at the end of the game, I didn’t have a craving for any more though. The story is bland and very forgettable. There is a small amount of character development, but because they are both so generic in their stereotypes, I found it very hard to care about either of them.  There is a high replay ability factor with this game though. Having only played it on single player and I focused my time on using E’lara, I could quite easily replay the game and get a whole different experience just from using Caddoc. You can also get probably at least one more run throughout of the game on co-op mode too. So you can probably reach about 25 hours’ worth of content if you push it.\n\nTechnically, there were a few problems. Like I said above, I was playing on 4k resolution with graphics ramped up to max. Whilst playing I noticed there to be a significant stutter in the game when you are entering a new area. At first I thought it was purely a resolution thing, so I dropped it down to 1440p but it was still the same, so I tried again to 1080p and the stutter was still there. I even turned down all of the options to minimum and the stutter still existed. So to put it shortly, I am not sure what causes this stutter, given that you are changing areas quite frequently you will suffer from it a lot too.  Another issue I had, was the camera when your character is sprinting, it just jolts up and down all over the place and actually gave me a head ache because of it. Luckily you don’t need to sprint that often thankfully.\n\nTo sum up, Hunted: The Demon’s Forge has some nicely presented game play and mediocre visuals. The story is forgettable and voice acting is on the poor side of the scale. Overall, it is merely just an average game. Yes it is 5 years old at this point so take all of this with that into consideration. If it weren’t for the fun game play, I would have put this down as a negative review, however I will purely just recommend Hunted: The Demon’s Forge for purchase only when on sale. The game is retailing at £9, 99 but there are much better games of this genre out there for that price.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

Your basicaly never alone, the premise is two people and the game sticks with it. the great thing about this is that the AI doesn't suck, yes sometimes (realy seldom) there's a little path-finding issue, but in general you "feel" like playing with a another person, no matter if it's combat, exploring or a riddle your team is solving.\n\nThe story centers on those two and is actualy not that bad, it's not the grand scheme of things which is important, but their relationship. you will chuckly hearing some their pockin at each other, you will feel attached to both after some time. especialy when playing singelplayer this game provides an amazing expierience simply from the fact of your companion. i've never played a game where my ai-companion felt that much alive/real and that is taking never Bioware games into account.\n\n\nOverall:\n-still realy good visuals\n-fantastic soundtrack, great voiceover (english)\n-tight controls, polished combat\n-an interesting story, which is more suited for mature players, both mainchars are not "heroes" and they show a real lack of empathie for anyone but themselves (which is a fantastic setup and i did love it, but not suited for minors)\n-an interesting gameworld and a great sense of exploring/dungeoncrawling\n-in general a great sense of polish and budget\n-one of the best integrations of an Ai-companion\n-creat two player co-op (but since game-spy is down you will have to read up on gettin co-op started)\n\nway underrated simply cause people expected something completly diffrent than the dev always promised. Hunted is like  one of those great old-school arpgs, immersive stroy and gameplay but not sporting a open world setting.","March 8, 2015","true","16.7"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","37","42","0","0"

It's a modern, co-op, cover-based, action game set in a rich dark fantasy world." - Matt Findley, President of InXile Entertainment.\n\nAlthough Hunted: The Demon's Forge may seems to be flawed and lacked in polish in many ways on the surface because its developer was focusing on the other bigger and more anticipated title of theirs, what the core of Hunted: Demon's Forge capable of delivering are still considered to be the best by many co-op game players and dungeon crawlers across the world.\n\nThere are many dungeon games out there - but none of them are quite like Hunted. Hunted has pretty much every good traditions and classic elements of the old school dungeon game such as riddles to solve, secret areas to explore and enemies that dungeon fans would expect to encouner. But with a big guy with sword, elven lady with bow and vicious creatures like minotaur and dragon. Hunted instead of being just a big cliché all over again, it is rather more like mixing these clichés together in a dark fantasy world - and then throw it back onto your head with the qualities of modern platforms and human designs.\n\nAfter all, Hunted may be far from perfection in terms of presentation, bug-free, PC optimization, gameplay diversity and replayability. But this is also exactly why the sequel of it will be so promising and worthy after we see how good these things together turned out to be in the actual gameplay of Hunted. There will be just you, your partner; simple yet solid gameplay mechanics and a ton of straight forward hack-and-slash actions. And I just can't wait for a better sequel that unfolds the upcoming journey of our lovely mercenary pair - or - perhaps more like couple in blood, sweat and sarcasms.\n\nRecommended for dungeon srawlers or anyone who want some simple intuitive action gameplay. Better to play with a friend.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- For in-game actions: Even through a yet perfected and limited combat system, you can still tell that's how fast-paced hack-and-slash melee actions should be like in a thirdperson action game. As for bow and arrow, casting devastating magics and the boob jiggles whenever she bend over to pick up the money, those are extras. *Sorry, there aren't a ton of button smashing during cutscene in slow motion.\n\n- For overall presentation quality: Small detail in the environment may proves to be raw and very under polished (even at max settings.) But the voice lines as well as the interactions between our couple in the game tend to make you giggle and care less about these picky dissatisfactions.","October 15, 2013","true","115.6"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","20","26","0","10"

The game will have you walking a straight path and have you take occasional little side path into alcoves, which normally contains special loot. The loot basically consist of axe, sword and bludgeon weapons for Caddoc.  E'lara the elf will have different verity of bows, ranging from fast, medium and slow. Both character shares similar shield types.\n\nThe game reminds me of Skyrim, as if its in the same universe. Combat wise the game exceeds that of skyrim, where i found my self wishing Skyrim was this intense. At some point the game feels sort of gears of war'ish, as if the game was inspired by that series. Hunted has a small cover based aspect to it, similar to gears. The cover aspect personally doesn't make you feel safe as you do in gears.\n\nThe chemistry between the two characters is decent. No sexual tension, no forced sexual relationship, being the two characters are male and female. The relationship between the characters is pure business and professional, which i like.\n\nThe game was enjoyable, though the game has some limitation. i felt as if more could be done about the character building, its very limited. As liner and as limited as the game seem, its still quite enjoyable, especially after playing the mounds of games that encourage you to explore and side-venture away from a games story or path.","May 6","true","15.2"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Hunted: The Demon's Forge is a game that lets you choose (and swap) between melee hack-and-slash or shooter, and employs a smooth combat system and a beautifully textured world. There's a certain thrill factor that makes the game quite enjoyable.\n\nHowever, the game does have some pitfalls: The objectives are very linear. There are a few secrets or side-quests here or there but nothing that actually makes a difference in the long run. Between zones, the transitions get very obvious and repetitive after a while.

You can level up and specialize your character, so he or she has a unique edge in battle. Besides taking down enemies with bows and arrows or swords and shields you can also use magic on your foes.\n\nThere are points of the game where you have to solve puzzles and you’re separated with your buddy, so it all relies on teamwork.\n\nI don’t see why I shouldn’t recommend this game.

There isn't much customisation involved and you get to choose only one of the two characters in the game, both are very amusing to play with, and both come with melee and ranged weapons together. I haven't noticed any major bugs or lag issues with the game, and there are plenty of people playing it cooperatively online so you won't be alone. Only problem with the game is that it's awfully linear and the character progression is limited to the game you're playing at that moment, meaning you don't get to keep your character but its saved in the savegame of the host. The game is not worth the launch price but it's quite cheap now and very well made. It uses Unreal Engine, has great voice acting and very fluid and easy controls.

Sure, it has its flaws, but the gameplay is fun and the loot and hidden areas/items give me incentive to keep playing. It's quite addictive. The graphics aren't the best I've ever seen but they get the job done (they can be very moody) and areas show enough detail and variation to keep things fresh. The main characters are a bit dull though, which is a shame. I enjoy playing with the elf more than with the human, but I'm sure the game was meant to be played with the elf as well as the human, so I guess that's a (small) flaw (I don't mind actually). The loot is random and there isn't a whole lot of great items but it's a great feeling once you find a better weapon. Also, rescueing people is a cool idea and I'd like to see more games implement this (where you actually have to shoot the ropes to save them and not just press a button to automatically save them). Cool story as well ! A solid 80/100 for me. Is it worth €50 ? No. €25-30 ? Yes !\n\n[Rating: 82/100]","September 22, 2011","true","12.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Brian Fargo is somehow involved with this, so this had to be good - right?\n\nMuch to my disappointment this is a rather broken piece of software - beginning with the tutorial the game desynced a couple of times, not loading certain triggers to advance the (heavily scripted) romp through grimdark lands, forcing me to replay the beginning three times until it would finally allow me to push some stupid cart and advance. Just to do the same at the first obelisk were you should switch your characters. And then again in the first actual mission. And about halfway into that actual mission. Which was the point I stopped. From what I can tell the game is pretty mediocre mix of everything that was cool at the time (think Gears of War with a considerable lower budget and a fantasy theme slapped on), including hiding behind cover and popping off arrows into "these are not orcs, I swear".\n\nStory and characters seems to be aimed at 13 year olds, which becomes particularly apparent with the ladies whose main character traits mostly consists of revealing clothing and huge boobs. As an action game it felt underwhelming and reminiscent of the terrible Forgotten Realms: The Demon Stone - with very basic fighting mechanics and a clunky interface, particularly when playing alone - making the partner-feature more of nuissance than a welcomed addition. At least the writing is half decent, and I got a chuckle or two out of the snarky remarks both heroes keep exchanging.\n\nIf you get this working the way it was intended and can stomach the blandness of it, it might be worth spending a couple hours on this with a friend.

This game seems like a very lite version of the Souls game; dodge, roll, strike, move in and out. It's a fun experience and fairly challenging as well. I played the game solo and had fun but it can be played co-op and I imagine that is the ideal way to play. I can see this being a very fun coop play through.\n\nWhile the combat is fun, the magic surprised me the most. Chucking fireball grenades is immensely satisfying when you take out an entire group of enemies. There's some support spells as well, so it mixes things up pretty well.\n\nThe game can get a bit on the repetitive side, but I think that was due to me playing it in extended sessions. My playtime (8 hrs) could have easily been doubled if I had done some exploring and done some of the optional quests. There's more content to this game than I was expecting. If you don't do any side stuff like myself, the game is pretty linear, which I don't mind, but is worth noting.\n\nI bought it for $5 and am pretty happy with that purchase. If you can grab it around that price or even a little higher, I would certainly say it's worth it.\n\nP.S. - Don't drink the Sleg!!!","May 1, 2015","true","8.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The co-op is fun, the game itself is somewhat difficult, variety of weapons/armor (both of which show up on your character). It's a bit gruesome/mature at some points, and I like that.

Second of all, I got this as a gift to play CO - OP online as advertized. And the latter is from difficult to do, next to impossible, since the lazy creators of the game's company don't bother to add a patch for 2 frikkin' years now that gamespy has seaced operations, to move to a working service for the online multiplayer co-operative action to function. Therefore, I don't recommend this game, untill this is fixed, which doesn't seem like it's gonna happen any time soon, or at all. Third of all, I have to say that I will stop buying or ask as gifts any game from Bethesda unless they show some courtecy interest about the wellfare of their customers, like me and my friend you bought two copies for 40$ and didn't got delivered the fun he and I was supposed to have.","April 10","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
