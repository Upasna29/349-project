Old school 3D shooter fun (not as old school as DOOM, of course) at its best.\n\nThere's a difficulty for everyone. At the lowest setting, nobody should have a problem. At the highest setting, for the hardcore gamer in you, the game is still playable and tons of fun with hundreds if not thousands of enemies coming at you, all with their particular appearance, warning sound effect, powers and personality.\n\nYou will rush for health and bullets, but always feel like you can overcome the odds and feel like a superhuman at the end of the day.\n\nThe environments are more varied and beautiful than in the first game, there's more humor and even the freaking secrets are fun this time around.","November 23, 2013","true","0.1"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","25","27","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonerD/recommended/41060/","LonerD","Darkwave","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonerD/","599 products in account","Once again Sam returns for an epic crusade through literally thousands of adversaries. It is not so much a question as to which one of the games (first or second encounter) is better; they are both epic for their own way.\nThe first encounter's levels were more straightforward, and I love them for that. The ambiance is somehow a little better, the balance is great and it is a slightly more dodge and shoot type of game than the second encounter.\nThe second encounter improves and alters on some points. First of all, the weapon additions are excellent. Although I never use the chainsaw because most enemy mixes contain suicide bombers (aaaaaaaaah, you hear them in your sleep after a day of play) chainsaws are not the best weapon of choice. The others fit into the mix just perfectly, and the levels make sure to add sniper-sections so you can use them. The flamer is just all-round usefull, since most of the time you'll be engaging in closer-than-comfortable combat.\nThe levels show off some cool quirks, like moving walls of darkness, odd gravitational challenges and overal madness, though I did feel these novelties were mostly present in the first half of the game. The last levels are also very good.\nI didn't like the difficulty for multiplayer. Often, the enemy mixes just don't make for a comfortable fight, and kleers are often abundantly present while for instance the suicide bombers and the bulls make a much funnier enemy if you see them run down your friend. After shooting your zillionth kleer in multiplayer, hearing the damn hooves again can get a little tiresome. I somehow feel the enemy dosage in the first encounter was better.\nThat aside, it makes for an exhilerating singleplayer adventure and is perfect to hone your turn and shoot-skills, because there honestly isn't a shooter available that has as much enemies in it as serious sam, and for that I love the game.\nMultiplayer coop is where it shines, because there is no item stealing (everyone has his own instance of items) and you don't lose a lot when dying. That allows you to stay in the carnage continously. Some environments make getting separated from your friends rather easy, but other than that, coop is a blast. You might want to skip the first few levels though, because apart from some interesting traps, the levels after that offer the most interesting environments.\nAll-in-all, if you take the game for what it is, a masterful old-school shooting frenzy, then you'll love it a lot. Do get some friends to play with, though, it makes it even better.\nHighly recommended.","February 28","true","4.1"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

Much in the same way the First Encounter did this sequel makes no pretense of having a story or anything of the sort. This is about shooting aliens and looking cool while doing it, nothing more and nothing less.\n\nRight out the gate you will notice the similarities to the First Encounter, not much has changed overall. The graphics has gotten a little sharper, the enemies a little faster, the locales more varied. Although this rehash of the original does pain me somewhat, I would have loved to seen more innovation than this, it does still succeed on the same basic levels as the original did. The Second Encounter is a no frills, full speed ahead first person shooter featuring a badass protagonist spouting off one liners that would have made Duke Nukem proud.\n\nInstead of just the sandy surroundings of the original you now get to slaughter through alien hordes in a variety of different locales, still looking as pretty as ever. The maps are still huge and the number of enemies that gets thrown at you is still preposterous. A bigger emphasis on environmental traps makes for some very intense encounters although the puzzle sections are still highly lacking. In particular the series of jumping puzzles near the start of the game leaves you bored and hoping at that some headless suiciders come crashing through soon.\n\nSome new weapons are introduced, most notably the sniper rifle and although Sam Stone still has a high quality arsenal at his disposal you are as last time around lacking that one iconic gun you will remember for years to come.\n\nThe soundtrack is relatively unimpressive but the weapons sounds great, both the firing and the impacting. Sam's one liners are still funny and the ambiance is passable.\n\nAll in all Serious Sam The Second Encounter could best be described as a plus one sequel. The developers have taken everything they liked from the first game and simply added a little something extra to every aspect. This creates an experience that is every bit as entertaining but still earns a little disappointment for not innovating more. Like the original, this was a bargain price even on release and as such it is a game that should be in the library of every serious FPS gamer.","June 4, 2013","true","24.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/recommended/41060/","talgaby","talgaby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/","334 products in account","Short version: 77% The second Serious Sam game feels like a set of small half-finished expansions eventually packed together and sold as a separate FPS. The levels are a bit of a hit and miss, but the new weapons make sure that battling the endless hordes of Mental is more fun than ever.\n\nLong version: Serious Sam: The Second Encounter is the second game of the Serious Sam franchise, which is probably one of the longest-enduring classic old-school FPS series that still didn’t cave in and switched to the hand-holding console shooter format.\nTSE is sold as a standalone product, yet it feels like three expansion disks glued together as one. After all, it is divided into three separate worlds, each with its own boss, and each resetting Sam’s arsenal at their start.\n\nThe first episode, South America, is probably the weakest. The first game really lacked exterior levels, which they tried to address here, but the result is just a lot of boring walking with a fairly uninteresting boss battle at the end.\nPersia quickly picks up the pace with the return of courtyards (CroTeam’s specialty in level design) and by somehow making underground levels interesting. A climactic battle at the top of the Tower of Babel would have been nice, but the boss they created instead makes up for it.\nAnd finally, medieval Poland just drops all players into the thick of things, with levels requiring speed and precision, and also a lot of endurance; especially on the final stage, which makes the Great Pyramid of the First Encounter look like a cakewalk in comparison.\n\nThe new weapons– including a flamethrower and a sniper rifle– turn up the dial on the action by several degrees, and it comes with no surprise that the game really wanted to steer people towards multiplayer with these changes. Still, even in single player, Serious Sam TSE is a great old-school shooter that could have easily surpassed its predecessor if the first few stages wouldn’t be so bland.\n\nYou can also follow the Completing the Backlog Curator page for more reviews!","January 20","true","15.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

It's easy to see that the developers were inspired by games such as Duke Nukem 3D. But SS:TSE is more than just a simple parody game. It is easily one of the top 5 single-player FPS ever made. It succeeds at everything it attempts to do.\n\nThe weapon balance is superb. Aside from the revolvers you start out with, all weapons are fun to use and have different strengths and weaknesses. Not one weapon just replaces another. Even in the last few levels, when your arsenal is complete, you'll still use all weapons on a regular basis. Every weapon is good or bad in different situations and against different enemies, and it is not uncommon to switch between them all the time, every few seconds, during big fights.\n\nThe enemy design is just as great. All enemies are distinctively different from one another and require different tactics to defeat. What is notable is that every enemy makes different noises, and not long after picking up the game you'll be able to identify enemies based on the sounds you hear. More often than not you can hear attacking foes before you can see them.\nDuring the many fights, SS:TSE will throw multiple enemies of different types at you at the same time. Some require immediate attention, while others are annoying or distracting, and you'll have to prioritize the order in which you kill them. Certain enemies (Kleer and Beheaded Kamikaze in particular) are so memorable that they even spawned internet memes, which is no small accomplishment. The bosses are big, bad and fun to fight.\n\nLeveldesign is as good as it gets. Compared to SS:The First Encounter, which, while still a great game, had Egypt and desert everywhere, The Second Encounter made a big step forward and sports grass levels, snow levels, lava levels and more. Also, it has many rooms with traps and gimmicks (usually with physics), which are a nice change of pace from the otherwise constant shooting. They are fun in general, although some can be a pain on higher difficulties. The game is quite linear, though there are many secrets to be found, many of which are far off the road.\n\nUnless you want to play multiplayer, I recommend playing the old version over HD. HD changes quite a large number of things, not just the graphics. The graphics of the classic version work perfectly fine, as the artstyle is a good mix between cartoony and realistic. In the HD version, the grass, trees and visual effects often obscure your vision of enemies. Gravity works differently, so one particular gimmick room had to be changed. Harpies can no longer carry and drop Beheaded Kamikaze. The minigun does twice the damage per hit but fires at half the rate. The projectiles fired by demons are destructible. There are many more gameplay changes that would take too much time to list. All in all, for this particular game in the series, the classic version is a slightly better experience over the HD version.\n\nSerious Sam: The Second Encounter does so many things right and so few things wrong that it stands at the top of the FPS genre. It is a must-have for anyone who's even slightly interested in FPS.","January 12","true","19.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Everything about the original Serious Sam you should know and should love, except longer. Instead of Ancient Egypt, as  was the first game's theme, now it's a romp around South American temples, the gardens of Babylon, and... to be honest, I'm not entirely sure what the last place was, but it looked like Europe. As with The First Encounter, this game will make you laugh out loud. Everything this game does to avoid taking itself seriously have some amazing results. If I said this game wasn't a "buy", I would hire someone to give me electroshock until I remembered what this game was.","March 10, 2014","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's about 95% accurate for The Second Encounter.\n\nMy Review for the first game\n\nSecond Encounter is almost identical to the First Encounter. Enemies remain the same, except for a few ones that I didn't remember in the first game. Guns, graphics, sounds, overall feel, gameplay are all the same. Which is not a negative because it worked for the first game.\n\nI did notice one big difference between the two. Difficulty. I played on normal and was dying very quickly even at the beginning of the game. Wanting to not pull my hair out and actually finish the game, I put on god mode for the remainder of my playthrough. I was amazed at how many enemies they threw at you. Some levels would have 500-700 enemies. The last level having over 1,000. This was not without having power-ups, health and ammo scattered very frequently across the maps. But still…sheesh!\n\nA lot of the levels have similar ways to complete them. Progress until either you have to kill off all the enemies in the area or collect a certain number of “something” to unlock a door…while killing off all the enemies. It gets a little repetitive but still remains fun (since god mode was on haha)\n\nPros:\n-Good graphics for the time that still hold up today\n-Lots of graphics options to tinker around with\n-Good gameplay feel and hit detection\n-Unique audio cues for enemies\n-Each gun has advantages & disadvantages\n-Quick save/load feature\n-Stable. Never crashed on me (Windows 8.1 64bit)\n-Secret areas everywhere!\n-Generally smooth 60FPS (has some slowdown here and there but didn't affect much)\n\nCons:\n-Lackluster story, again\n-Repeating enemies\n-Difficulty seemed crazy for “normal”\n-Can feel repetitive\n-Enemies that “pop” in right in front of you seems cheap\n\nSecond Encounter is a worthy and fun sequel. A big difficulty shift is hard to swallow but luckily god mode is there to help you out. It keeps to the same formula as the first game since it was successful.\n\n6/10","January 27","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
