"http://steamcommunity.com/id/z3nii/recommended/235070/","z3nii","zenii","http://steamcommunity.com/id/z3nii/","1908 products in account","The premise for bad bots is the standard sci-fi trope about robots that have been programmed to kill, with you, the main character, being the only one capable of stopping them. The story isn't very good but it isn't terrible either, it's kind of just there to move the game along. The set pieces and art style are servicable - you end up seeing a lot of the same sprites and textures, but there's enough variance that you don't feel like you're going down the same corridor for the hundredth time. The music and sound are, well, below average at best, but it wasn't so bad that I felt like I had to turn it off or anything.\n\nNow, as for the actualy gameplay. It's a side-scrolling shooter, you have your axe, a rifle, and can pick up various "special" weapons along the way. The axe and rifle work well enough for most enemies, and the different special weapons each behave a little differently, which spices things up a bit. I played on medium difficulty, and it wasn't too difficult, but there is one fatal gameplay flaw that kind of ruins the game. Whenever you get hit by anything other than a gun, you have to go through a 1-2 second "getting hit" animation where you can't move. Now, for the first half of the game, it's not really noticable, since there aren't too many enemies at one time, and most of them are shooting at you, but in the second half when the game locks you into rooms with 20-30 melee enemies? Yeah, not so fun. There are multiple times where I would get "stunlocked" by melee enemies to the point where I couldn't even move, and I just had to watch them slowly drain my health to zero while I repeated the "getting hit" animation for god knows how many times. The only way to clear those rooms is to never get hit, which, when there are 30+ killer robots in a locked room with you, is harder than it looks. This is also especially frustrating for the few "boss" sequences, in a game, where you're locked in a tiny room with a robot that's as big as your jump height, making it almost impossible to dodge, and each time you get hit you go through the "getting hit" animation so that the boss has ample time to hit you again, making you stunned again, ad infinum.\n\nSo yeah, an average game ruined by a fatal game flaw. I wish it wasn't so because for the first hour or two I played, it was actually enjoyable, which is a pleasant surprise for bundle fodder, but during the second half I was cursing the game and wanting to get it over with more than I was having fun.\n\nWorth checking out?: Maybe\nLikeliness of being bundled: Medium\nPrice you should pay?: ~$1 or less","May 4, 2014","false","2.9"," 37 of 52 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","37","52","0","0"

I spent a great deal of time combing the forums to get a feel for what Bad Bots exactly was. Not to mention starting a post that insisted that games such as Bad Bots should have a demo when mixed reviews come into play.\n\nOnce the demo was made available, I spent about an hour playing Bad Bots, got a feel for the dynamics, and quickly realized that I needed this game ASAP.\n\nThat being said... The game is great. Bad Bots has an old school vibe that reminds me of a SEGA game called "Slime World." If you're into murdering blood thirsty robots and trying to save Earth from being attacked by the Titan Hauler, this is the game for you. As the only living human survivor aboard the ship its up to YOU to save the Earth from being overrun by millions of murderous robots.\n\nBad Bots has several different weapon upgrades and choices, tons of hidden rooms, and a great story that keeps you on your toes and guessing the whole time. Plot twists and hard bosses round out the game and make it a must have for anyone who enjoys a good platformer.\n\nGraphics: 6/10\nPlayablity: 7/10\nStory: 8/10\nChallenge: 7/10\nReplay Value: 8/10","July 28, 2013","true","7.7"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/235070/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4382 products in account","In Bad Bots you're a mechanic who finds himself on a spaceship that's overrun by berserk robots. The story begins promisingly: you find yourself in a compactor akin to Star Wars and have to escape there with a portable AI who aids you on the way. Story advances in static cutscenes like a comic.\n\nThen you meet the first knife bots. Their animation is annoyingly clunky. The bots will be armed with guns soon, thankfully with a better animation, and so are you: they will shoot you from behind boxes and will take cover if shot, which is cool. However, it is soon realized that their damage output is appalling: if faced with a single bot, it would take forever to die, for most attacks cause 1 HP of damage and you have 100 HP. Coupled with the fact the spaceship is full of health packs with 20 HP heal each, you probably won't die unintentionally during the story campaign except maybe to the final boss (or that death trap of a compactor along the way). You can effectively charge any non-boss enemy. To amend this, the game later throws at you tens or even hundreds of melee bots, electrocuting service droids and wall-crawling critter bots whose purpose is not explained.\n\nThese "waves" become easy when you start to understand the controls. Those are at times rather quirky. Jumping, you might hold on to a ledge you did not want to. Character defaults to climbing ladders, during which you cannot shoot, and you can't fall off the ladder except by jumping sideways upwards. At the top of the ladder the character might not take off the ladder at all to the direction you wanted, requiring awkward multiple tries to get it working.\n\nThere's no music except in the title screen. The game could have benefited from some eerie music, but now it's just awkward. Maybe you could put some scifi-style music on the background.\n\nOne thing that works is the spaceship interior design. The ship has everything a dreadnought is supposed to have from living quarters to storage to waste disposal, and it's used as well within the story. However the story, while beginning nicely, quickly proves to be rather stereotypic. And due to the bots' damage output being so low, it is implausible that the bots ever succeeded killing the rest of the crew.\n\nAs a basic platformer this game is okay. I would not call it a good platformer game though and can't recommend it. There's nothing new to the genre and it's otherwise too basic and simplistic to stand out. If you're still interested and/or just love platformers, I'd advice to get it on sale. For achievement hunters, it's quite alright, as it is fast to get them all: 4 to 5 hours should do it, unless you miss some on the first campaign run like I did.","December 7, 2013","false","5.7"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","0"

The game looks nice and the idea is good. The story is... Meh. The audio is not good and the crane audio hurts my ears. The music is repetitive and simple, but not that bad. The game so far is very easy on medium difficulty, hitting a trap removes 1 to 2% of my life...\n\nNow, I have to list alot of CONS:\n\n-Some sounds will annoy you and make you want to leave some rooms ASAP.\n-Gameplay is extremely repetitive.\n-Lots of crash ( as of now, anyways. ) I crashed 3 times within 30 minutes and now I am stuck forever because whenever I exit the saveroom, my game crashes. I am trying to contact the Dev at moment because I know he is active. UPDATE: The devs fixed this bug and now after finding a key and dying, I cannot reload my game anymore.\n-The monster variety is almost inexistant.\n-The balance is not the best (some rooms have 4-5 monsters, some have a swarm of 30 at once...)\n-No graphic options other than fullscreen.\n-Cannot customize controls, SPACE to change weapons, W to jump, S to crouch.\n-Screen tearing.\n-The game feels clunky.\n-There's no reloading on any guns, they have infinite ammos if you find that many.\n-In some rooms, after making the slight mistake and letting the 50 robots chasing you hit you a single time, you be unable to control your character until you die.\n\nI don't recommend this game, all of this is fixable by the Devs if they want to make the game better (and playable, for me.)","March 27, 2014","false","6.1"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","17","27","0","0"

Since the enemy hits you almost instantly, the *vast* majority of combat is just trading hits with the enemy. Note: due to poor combat mechanics, you *have* to just trade hits with the enemy until they die a lot of the time.\n-Balance is awful. You take 1 damage from environmental effects and 1-2 from enemies. Health packs which are EXTREMELY abundant provide 20 health so you never have an issue with health. However, near the very end of the game there is a "quarantine" room (see below) which throws way too many melee enemies that simply chain-stun you to death. Until this point in the game I did not even come close to dying (except on one boss where you just trade blows as usual). However, I was unable to get past this room despite several attempts since the mobs just chain-stun you and there is nothing you can do.\n-"Quarantine" rooms: These are rooms that lock the doors on you and continuously spawn enemies at you until you kill them all. The concept is fine, but the problem is that there are way too many enemies spawning in each room, they spawn one by one, and there are way too many of these quarantine rooms back to back to back. Most of the time, you just sit in the corner holding the mouse button down....you could do it with your eyes closed. Its more a test of patience than anything else.\n-For a game with a metroidvania-esque map, there are no real collectibles, secret areas, etc.\n","April 21","false","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I love the look of the game, the colors and slight blockyness remind me of what would happen if old C64 games were remade with similar graphics (retrospec.org for those interested!), the controls are fine even if jumping can feel a little awkward, I havent had any issue with it so far. The only REAL let-down is that towards what I assume to be the middle of the game, the level design goes from "Kill the enemies in the room, move on", to these obnoxious "QUARANTINE ROOMS" where they just throw you a seemingly endless barrage of enemies at you... which might seem fun and exciting, expect for the fact that you can just stand there, back to the wall and hold the trigger. If this was just a one off, or happened rarely, then this would be fine - but sometimes you'll go through 3 rooms of the same thing. It stinks of someone wanting to expand gametime, but not wanting to put any actual effort into it. That being said, everything around those sections is pretty fun. If you can get this bundled or on the cheap, then its not a bad buy - it feels like a Predecessor to SHOOT MANY ROBOTS. So, whilst I do HATE the quarantine sections, I cant really say its a game to avoid - so it IS recommended, but not highly.","May 2, 2014","true","4.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

Reminds me most of Bio-Menace (1993) and a few other old games.\n\nI encountered some minor issues. It was a bit tricky to shoot over cover (but cool that you and the robots could duck behind it!). I found that occasionally my equipped weapon randomly changes (when I change and then jump straight away?). I sometimes found it hard to get off ladders unable to defend and avoid enemy attacks. The boss fight that I encountered could have been better I couldn’t see a way to get out of the bosses path (i.e. grab a handhold and hang from the roof above it or something). Basically the battle boiled down to it semi-stun locking me and having to out damage it.\n\nHowever I enjoyed the game so far. It has a story with cut-scenes in a comic book style (sort of like in the original X-Com). It wasn’t so retro that you couldn’t aim with the mouse. The Sci-fi space ship environment music were cool. Crawling through service ducts are a nice addition to the corridors and rooms. Remains of the brutally murdered crew scattered throughout the ship added to the atmosphere.\n\nIt is probably (I say probably because I haven’t play the whole game) worth it’s $1.99 price tag on steam. At the moment it is only $0.49 which is the price I got it for and it was worth it even just for the short time that I played.\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","June 27, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

With a plot right out of an Asimov novel, Sam McRae finds himself the only survivor of a robotic uprising incited by a malevolent AI; a story we are all familiar with, but maybe originality isn't what this game is going for.\n\nI've spent just about a half-hour in game by the time of doing this review, maybe that's too short but in my opinion it was easy to see where the game was going. In either case, feel free to take my review with a grain of salt due to my lack of time in the game.\n\nIn a very crowded market of side-scrollers does Bad Bots have what it takes to stand a head taller than the rest? Personally, I don't think so. Maybe it's just my affinity for this sort of games but I feel like Bad Bots could have been a good game but the game's overall lack of polish and thoughtfulness hold it back. First of all, there's very little music in the game, I even thought the game was broken at first. I suspect it was aiming for a Half-Life vibe but I don't think it achieves this. In Half-life there are many other sound effects and visuals to occupy your attention, but with Bad Bots you're left with an aural void that doesn't feel particularly artistic and more like the developers trying to save money. I mentioned previously that this game lacked thoughtfulness; unlike a well thought out game of this genre where every room and enemy is placed with intention, rooms in this game seem to be thrown in arbitrarily and filled with rows of identical enemies. It's also nearly impossible to avoid being hit as enemies shoot with laser precision (hey, they're robots after all) through all manner of platforms and other obstetrical. To compensate the level is loaded with copious amounts of ammo and health and in my book this is a sign of weak level design.\n\nIn my first 30 minutes of gameplay I was able to make it to the first boss; they actually busted out the music for this battle. The boss quickly fell to my weapon in the matter of seconds. This lack of challenge doesn't inspire me to keep playing and leaves me with an empty gaming experience. I supect the challenge level would increase later on, but based on the previous gameplay how much of this challenge is derived from unavoidable damage taken from laser accurate gunfire.\n\nBad Bots appears to be a port of a Xbox game so it does support USB controllers. Conversely it seems they put minimal effort into doing a proper PC port as it lacks any options to rebind keys or even view what the keyboard controls art. Even the ingame control hits still show the Xbox buttons when you are using a keyboard/mouse. Playing with the keyboard and mouse literally required me to guess what the buttons are.\n\nOn the positive side, besides for the pixely graphics and retro gameplay (which is entirely subjective) the feel on destroying enemies is quite good. The game features storyboards that narrate the story and the overall presentation is decent but the previously mentioned flaws keep me from recommending this title. It's a shame as I feel this game did have potential.\n\nScore: 5/10","December 19, 2013","false","1.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The story of the game revolves around Sam McRae as he wakes up from his hypersleep while traveling on the Titan Hauler. Once awake, Sam finds himself in all sorts of trouble. For starters, the Titan Hauler is on a crash course with Earth. As if that’s not bad enough, the ship’s robotic crew have been reprogrammed and now want to destroy all humans. This is not good since Sam happens to be a human. Poor guy.\n\nWhile the game does have you mainly on a straightforward path, I never felt hindered by this. This is not like a JRPG where you have towns to explore and vast lands that hold untold fortunes. You accept at the beginning of the game that you are stuck on this ship and that there are not going to be a lot of places to explore. While for the most part you will be going left or right from room to room, near the end of the game you will need to backtrack a bit to reenter rooms you were previously in. I never really found myself too lost during this time, but you will need to wander around the ship until you find what you are looking for.\n\nBad Bots visually looks like exactly what it is, a side-scrolling game with a retro throwback. The game features a retro-style that does not entertain the notion of being a graphical powerhouse. The Titan Hauler is in bad shape and features broken bits here and there that reflect what the ship has been through. The robots each have a distinct look that is simple yet pleasing to look at. The first robots you get to kill are mostly red and are holding a knife: which they seem to take pleasure in shanking you with! These robots, once they notice you, will bee-line right for you with their knife slashing as if they are ready to take you on even from afar. The robots with guns begin shooting once they see you. If they are on a walkway that is above you and made of metal, the bullets cannot reach you and you will have a few seconds to swap your weapon, look for health or just examine the room. Other enemies include electrified spiders which run at full pace right at you to zap the life out of Sam.\n\nThe pros of this game far outweigh the cons. Even if such things as no background music and lack of a stellar story annoy you, the game is still worth a purchase, if only to shoot at some robots! I would recommend the game to anyone and will probably be killing robots for the foreseeable future in the challenge modes.","February 1, 2014","true","41.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I had full health but when they surrounded me it all just drained.  They compinsated for this with the saw blades and electricity and other things like it so that they stop and you don't get hit anymore, but with the enemies they don't stop they just keep attacking.

Actually those are the only options but hey they both persist after you close the game so it's already a step above Super Meat Boy and that horrible Zelda knockoff the Meat Boy idiots made.\n\nThat's actually the extent of the game - if you click anything other than Help/Options or Achievements the game thoughtfully closes without so much as a "Send Error Report" popup.

Thankfully, there are few punishing platforming traps.\n- However, enemies CAN see and shoot you and you can't shoot them back (well, you can shoot, but the collision won't register) unless about a half of their sprite is on the screen. Invulnerable shooting enemies would be freaking frustrating if they weren't so easy.\n- Iffy platform detection. Those hanging blue thingies don't have solid edges. Thankfully, the game doesn't have challenging jumps.\n- Badly designed boss fights. Well, at least the first one with Jackhammer bot. The arena has an obstacle, which you must jump over, but the boss can pass by. Combined with it's speed and fast melee attack wich resets your jump height and stunlocks you, again it would be very unfair and frustrating if it wasn't so easy. Just bring a big gun.\n- Bad aiming system. The aim sometimes jumps unpredictably, is very roughly sampled despite using analog aiming, glitches when the aiming cursor is near the edges of the screen.

Bought this for $1.50 so I can't really complain. It's an old school side scroller with old school design. It other words, it's a controller thrower...\n\nIt gets very repetitive, has no map despite a maze-like ship, has a terrible animation when you get hit that causes major problems later, and has a boring storyline whose sole twist you'll see coming from the start.\n\nThe difficulty can be adjusted, but in game it's pretty simple until the final part of the story. All of a sudden the difficulty is ramped WAY up. Instead of 4-5 opponents on screen, you've fighting 20 or more at once. Also, instead of the one hit kills you fought en masse earlier, these opponents take several shots to kill. Don't worry though, you get more powerful weapons along the way in the story, BUT in this phase they're very, very limited to what you brought and the crappy shotgun. Expect to run out of ammo before you clear the first room, and there are three of these... What makes it worse is that crappy "I got hit" animation that causes you to effectively get stuck in your enemies if you make the slightest mistake while moving non-stop during this phase. I can't say this is "old school design", just a huge design mistake.\n\nOnce you get past this area you get to fight a boss that you must grind down slowly. No easy trick to beat it and it'll take a few attempts for you to get the pattern down.\n\nI won't say this game is completely awful, but it's not great.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jstamos013/recommended/235070/","jstamos013","Stamos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jstamos013/","1142 products in account","Poorly designed. Good art, music and attempt at a game that is unfortunately, ultimately unfulfilling. The story is tiresome and overtold, the level(s?) are generic and repetitive and the gameplay is boring at best while irritating at worst. Frequently the latter on that last note.\n\nGeneral progression through the game looks like this:\n\n1. Standard metroidvania style setup. Controls are simple and easy to master. Areas to explore are largely unimaginative with little distinction between them. Only way to tell where you've been and where you're going are the signs drawn onto the background.\n\n2. Combat quickly becomes dull. Average amount of different weapons keeps things barely interesting but it soon becomes clear which weapons are preferred/best. Additionally, this isn't a game of precision or even trick shots. This is "plow your way through hordes of seemingly neverending murderous robots". There's no strategy beyond "shoot everything in sight". Additionally, since many of the enemies are melee combat enemies and the game spawns literally hundreds of them, there's a decent chance you'll get stuck, unable to move and jabbed to death. The reason this happens is because the game has a small "taking damage" frame in which the character cannot move. So every time you take damage, you also can't move. It's a very small frame, but with hundreds of enemies all attacking at once, the effect becomes continuous and loops you into an eventual death. This happens often. The only way to avoid it is to run, jump, and gun, doing everything you can to simply avoid the death frame loop.\nSome people might call this "strategy". I call it poor design.\n\n3. If frusteration doesn't do you in, boredom will. Tiresome, repetetive, all the other things I've listed here with little to no variation for the majority of the game. If you're not enthralled with the first 5 minutes, don't hold your breath waiting for it to change - because it won't.\n\nAll in all, I appreciate that making games is difficult. Particularly if you're an up and coming developer. To that end, for an amateur, this isn't bad. In fact, the art, music and length of it are somewhat impressive. But beyond amateur, this is shoddy and dull. If you have the option to play something great, play it. If you don't have that option, I guess Bad Bots will do. That's really all there is to say.","November 29, 2014","false","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Bad Bots doesn't really do much to make itself stand out in anyway except for in one really negative way. This is a standard side-scroller game that has elements of metroidvania to it, but only in a superficial way. You're dragged by nose through the plot which leads you directly to new areas that were closed off before. Where this game really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off were the sections where the room is sealed and you have to fight off a huge wave of enemies that try to swarm you. This seems like a cheap way to extend the length of a short game anyway and some of them required moving the controller in such a way that it was causing my hand physical pain to correctly jump around the screen to avoid death.","September 18, 2015","false","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not bad, but not great either. I guess I recomend it.
