You can make things as realistic or as arcady as you want, with extensive options for just about every aspect you could imagine. If you have ever wanted to get into a sub sim, man this is a great place to start. Silent hunter 4 is not that difficult to learn, and if you want to get into it quickly just go look up some game play videos online. I learnt the arcade and pro controls in just a few days, and after that I want and learnt the basics of how to use the in game editor. And that is probably my favorite part of Silent hunter 4, the editor. Included in SH4 is one of the best editors I have ever had the pleasure of using. I have no understanding of programming what so ever so I really dive into titles with comprehensive editing tools. With just a little research you can create your own missions and patrols for SH4, adding a nearly infinite replay value. And the amazing thing is the editor does not just feature the pacific, it feature a global map! Why they did this I have no idea, but its freaking awesome! So I can make missions in Hudson's bay or off the coast of Newfoundland if I want to. Its just pure awesome. Anyways, if you have ever wanted to experiment with a sub sim, this is your game. Its fun, challenging, and offers up a lot of replayability. I am amazed they packaged so much stuff in one game.","January 10, 2014","true","18.2"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","27","28","0","0"

This opens up the game to a rarely touched on theatre of operations from the Second World war; a huge plus. It's nice to see that such a popular setting is getting away from Normandy and Stalingrad, which have been played to death.\n\nOn the downside, the crews speak distinctly American English. You couldn't get some german voice actors to do the work, guys? That's a bit lazy.\n\nHUGE CAVEAT: DO NOT INSTALL THIS IF YOU INTEND TO PLAY SILENT HUNTER: WOLVES OF THE PACIFIC WHILE IT IS DOWNLOADING. THE EXPANSION DELETES PREVIOUS EXE FILES AND CREATES NEW ONES IN UNIFIED INSTALL","March 16, 2014","true","0.1"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","0"

This is a detailed, "all the widgets are under your control" submarine simulation.\n\nThe learning curve on this game can be prohibitively steep but there are some great tutorials and let's play videos on you-tube that can get you up and running.\n\nThe game is actively supported by the folks over at subsim.com and there are more MODS than you'll ever need.\nThe game can be manageable but enjoyable if you go for auto-targeting but the manual targeting option is a bit daunting.  I wish that it were more granular. For instance, I could see separating the task of ship recognition from the trigonometry of torpedo aiming.\n\nOne word of warning... even at its most difficult setting (called 100% realism in the game) it's NOT really challenging enough for many serious submariners. There are a number of mods that make it tougher.","December 22, 2014","true","185.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"
