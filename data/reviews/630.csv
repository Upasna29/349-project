"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/630/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nAlien Swarm is a Top-Down shooter with emphasis on multiplier teamwork with four total players. Alien Swarm was developed by Valve and released mid 2010. Many of the initial players were lured to the game by the lure of an Alien hat you can unlock via an achievement on Alien Swarm.\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: You are a member of a team of space troopers who are investigating the circumstances of a seemingly abandoned/evacuated space colony, and trying to recover whatever data is still available.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=511844225\n\nGameplay: Alien Swarm is played from a top-down shooter angle from a 60 degree camera angle, you move your cursor to aim, and can simultaneously walk any direction using the keyboard keys.\nSome people have dedicated servers for Alien swarm, however most people will simply host a game from their computer, your latency will depend on the hosts internet settings and physical location.\nAs you succeed or fail missions you will gain experience, this experience is put towards your level, when you level you unlock new weapons, armor, and tools. There are 25 potential weapons that can be chosen from, including special weapons like sentry guns.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=511844179\n\nAchievements: There are 66 achievements on Alien Swarm, after your first level you will get a good grasp of the different achievement difficulties, at the time that I'm writing this review, I've earned 53 achievements, most of which were earned either grinding by myself (by using a console command, it's possible to play solo online), or joining small groups online or playing with a friend occasionally.\nThere are two types of tough achievements: Beat the game on the hardest difficulties, and speed run achievements, both of these require a fairly coordinated group of players to work together and know what they're doing.\n\nPrice: The best part about Alien Swarm is that it's completely free! This is probably because the project was scrapped after the first campaign. It's nice that this game is free, but I would have preferred to pay for the game if it had a single player mode and more campaigns.\nThe good news is Alien Swarm was released with an “Alien Swarm software development kit” which is also free, so the Steam Community could create their own campaigns! Second best thing to the original dev's picking up the project again.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=511844204\n\nConclusion: Story: forgettable, but this game is more about the experience then the story narrative. Gameplay: addicting, fun, best to play with friends. Achievements: Many are soloable, you're better off with a group of pug players the easiest difficulty is your best bet if you want to learn the game. Not an easy 100% completed game. Price: Completely free to play.\nI love this game, even if it's free to play.  I've enjoyed playing this game in between playing other games more vigorously.  I recommend this game to anyone who wants a change of pace from the "status quo" of games out there. "This game will specifically appeal to gamers who enjoy dungeon crawlers, third person shooters, and alien kill grinding.\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update May 30, 2015:\nspelling, grammar, and punctuation fixes, thanks Angfucious! :)","September 4, 2015","true","25.3"," 120 of 129 people (93%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","93","120","129","8","0"

I used to play it everyday when I got home from school, I am now the last promotion/level. In the game you are basically a team of 4 Space Marines trying to defeat an Alien infestation, your team will come across many hardships while attempting this, on certain maps you have to kill parasite spawners to get to the next checkpoint or turn on reactors to reach the next objective. You can choose different classes that help your team in many ways, obviously the medic can heal the team, their is also a Tech that can hack into panels to open doors for the team. And of course their is the  Officer and Special Weapons that are unique in their own ways as well, mostly in combat.","March 2, 2014","true","191.5"," 77 of 84 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","77","84","0","9"

I have really easy answer to that, this game became definatelly the heart catching type of game over the time I spent with it. Already 3 years with it passed and it was one hell of journey. How you can call it a heck of journey, the game has only 1 campaign. Oh, well then lovel, you definatelly should check out all the custom addons that our smart modders make and if you think you are already hardcore enough (Not with your friendly fire), definatelly try playing on Alien Swarm Beyond Brutal servers. You have alot of options how to increase the playtime of this beautiful game.\n\nBefore I'll get back to killing some Aliens I would like to thank all of my fellow veterans who still stand tall & play.

Based on the movie Aliens.\n\nAlien Swarm is a top-down shooter set at a 60-degree angle. Four players can join a single co-operative game, the aim of which is to progress through science fiction-themed levels while eliminating waves of AI aliens. Players can choose from 40 different pieces of equipment.\n\nThe game is class-based, with players choosing from the roles of Officer, Special Weapons, Medic, and Tech. Each class has two selectable characters, with differences in abilities.\n\nOfficer =\nGrants a passive bonus to damage and damage resistance to nearby allies. He has access to the Vindicator, a class-restricted shotgun with an incendiary grenade launcher and has general all-around abilities. They are also capable of throwing extra amounts of explosive ordnance, and may find class-restricted ammo caches on the field for his Vindicator shotgun. The two playable characters are Sarge and Jaeger.\n\nSpecial Weapons =\nBrings raw damage to the table and starts out with a customized autogun with superior parameters, high magazine capacity, and auto-aiming ability. The Special Weapons gains access to a powerful minigun at a high enough level, and can pick up class-restricted ammo caches on the field. The two playable characters are Wildcat and Wolfe.\n\nMedic=\nIs the only class able to equip and deploy temporary healing beacons, and at a high enough level can use a medigun to selectively heal teammates and themselves.

They also have access to a prototype assault rifle with auto-aiming capabilities and the ability to fire stun grenades. The two playable characters are Crash and Vegas.\n\nThe game includes persistent statistics, unlockable equipment, and Steam Achievements.\n\nfor more info:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71N70PLDk0\n\nhttp://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/alien-swarm\n\nhttp://www.destructoid.com/review-alien-swarm-179900.phtml\n\nhttp://www.ign.com/games/alien-swarm/pc-744670","May 9","true","1.9"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","16","16","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LaggerCZE/recommended/630/","LaggerCZE","Lagger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LaggerCZE/","137 products in account","Alien Swarm is a game forgotten by both Valve as it's developer and the community. A game that had potential, but comes out just feeling unfinished. The concept is good enough, but it probably got canceled and someone just decided that it would be shame to leave it, and put up what they had at that time. And well, if it wasn't good enough, people didn't like it enough for it to become good thanks to the community.\n\nThe only thing that truly keeps this game alive, if you can even call it alive, is the fact it's fully Free to Play. No payment on Steam, no microtransactions, nothing. You can join the fray at any time and see what they got in store for you. However, it still features a level system - the more and the better you play, the bigger level you are and the better equipment you get.\n\nThis unlocks one of the games biggest advantages - a very smart equipment system. You can choose between four classes, with two characters for each, both with completely different playstyles. Then you get to choose your equipment, two weapons and a utility. Of course, all four of the classes have access to equipment available only to them, as well as access to certain shared equipment. For example, the Medic is the only one capable of carrying the Medikit or the Medigun, the Commander is the only one capable of carrying shotgun, the Engineer is the only one capable of carrying a rifle with autoaim etc. The game then features more than 40 weapons and about 15 utilities (if i recall correctly). This allows you to play the game differently every time, but thanks to the level system, certain weapons will always be better than others, even though the game does try to balance them out.\n\nThe gameplay is then based around a co-op mode for four players. You (and hopefully a team you can trust) are sent to a colony gone dark to investigate, and *drum roll* fight off aliens there *badumm tshhhhh*. However, you are alone. So you need to conserve ammunition, use medkits and cooperate while holding off the bugs in order to survive, and fulfil objectives along the way. All in a top-down Source game. That means the SDK makes the maps quite interesting, counting in things like fire, liquids or destructible enviroment, even some in-game animation parts along the way. This all creates a feeling of being swarmed and overrun, yet deeply dedicated to ending the mission succesfully and without casualities. Talking about casualities, it's worth noting that there's friendly fire ON by default. Watch it.\n\nProbably the most notable change is the Source SDK here. If a big community would be on... millions of maps. IT's just that easy to make them. Tile based creation and Source modelling = Map. I tried it out myself, it took me exactly 76 minutes to recreate the first level. It's just sad it is not used.\n\nAlso please note that Win 8 is not supported by this game. It will run after you install it, but Win 8 will screw up it's files and you'll have to reinstall sooner or later.\n\nAs to my recommendation, I can say that this is a game you will enjoy at first, and then become disappointed by later. Play at your own risk.","August 23, 2014","true","8.3"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/willyhastype2/recommended/630/","willyhastype2","Bigga the condom filler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/willyhastype2/","102 products in account","Alien Swarm is a team based birds eye view space themed shooter that in my opinion is quite underrated. Firstly, it is by Valve so you know it is good, except in the case of Ricochet but anyway. There is a large arsenal of weapons, tools, sentrys and other cool stuff to choose from and unlock from beating parts of the main Campaign with friends. I wouldnt say its something that brings new things to the table but it is still a quite fun game. But now the downsides, firstly, the game is barely played by anyone and there are pretty much never any servers open and the only way to level up is to play with friends or on servers, and for people like me who have no friends, it is quite annoying. secondly, Valve never bothered to make a second campaign for the game and it literally takes about 30 minutes to play through the whole game, so it gets quite repetitive if you are trying to level up and get new wepons, tools, etc. because you are playing the same 30 minutes of gameplay over and over. and finally, I am quite dissapointed that there is no way to unlock a rope so I can hang myself which we all know is a vital aspect of any game. So that lack of a rope really lets this title down. But I would still say the gameplay is fun and it was a good idea to begin with, even if it wasn't free I believe a game like this would be worth your money if you enjoy games of this genre.

One of Valve's babies... Alien Swarm. Completely lost in time, this fun alien top-view shooter puts you in control of a marine that is sent into a colony to kill the alien "swarm." Though it is free it lacks a lot of content. Now I do know this game was primarily made for the people to mod and make games out of ( Lambda Wars is a very good example) it has barely any campaign. If you have a good team the whole campaign can be completed in an hour or two.

It's a remake of Unreal Tournament 2004 mod with same name, I sure remember playing that one once.\n\nThe thing is, this game is strictly multiplayer. You can't beat it in single-player. Well, I mean, you can surely force yourself to, but it's not designed for this, hard and doesn't reveal full potential. Game has practice mode with bots, but only through the first two levels. Otherwise, you better find three more marines like you. Thankfully, public multiplayer is active enough, can find at least one game running.\n\nAnd yea, it's focused on teamwork by using loadouts. Got to balance between general and specialization and then not to shoot each other during gameplay. While campaign is short, it grows in difficulty non-stop, so there will be a challenge to a good team. Can always increase difficulty.\n\nIt's just a shame that it doesn't fit to lesser player count. I mean, would be nice to have it like in Left 4 Dead, where all spots are always filled with bots and players just take their place, and thus can always expect a support. Because when you play it with just one friend, it's hard to balance between firepower and special stuff. Almost always one tech, almost always one medic or you will die. But hey, not designed for that after all. It sure can be tough with just friend even on easy, sometimes.\n\nOh, there is no microtransaction. Valve didn't bother to profit from this in anyway, it's just that some devs that Valve hired were original creators of Alien Swarm mod for Unreal, I heard. It got modding support, but no Steam Workshop. And uses leveling system with which you can unlock new items as a way to prolong the life.\n\nBut eh. For free, it's pretty nice team game. But could use better music. Like most games.","October 14, 2015","true","9.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

Once an Unreal Tournament 2004 mod, is now a polished standalone game, kind of a sequel of sorts, on Steam.\n\nIt's a third person top-down shooter in which you and three friends blast your way through levels infested with hostile aliens and complete various objectives as you work your way through areas. There's quite a bit of weaponry to choose from as well as items, most of which you can unlock by completing levels and gaining exp and thus leveling up eventually.\n\nI kind of wish Valve would make a sequel to this with like 4 or 5 campaigns so we could buy it, play it, and love it.","February 4, 2014","true","154.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Working in teams of four is the only way to beat missions on tougher difficulties but the only way to have a team of four is to play with friends or on singleplayer (which sucls)\n2) Class restrictions - While you can play as any class in the game 2 are required for most missions. The Tech, who unlocks doors and completes objectives is required for some missions and if they die, you lose. The Medic - THis is the main problem, because there is no good way to heal other than the medi-gun some player is froced to go medic. Not too bad sometimes but if no-one else your playing with has unlocked the medi-gun, it can be hell.\n3) ITS TOO SHORT - A huge problem with this game is that it only has one campaign with 8 or so missions. These can be really fun but once completed there's not much to go back to.\n\nNow that I'm finished with negatives, here are some of the postives\n\n1) Classes - You can play as four classes, which are usaully fun with a good loadout. The Leader has a nice all-around skill, The Heavy just shoots the crap outta the aliens, the medic will save you from parasites and death and the tech unlocks doors, completes adjectives and is very useful. Oh and did I mention there are two characters of each class, for more variety :D\n2) Parasites - Yes, I just said parasites are a positive thing for this game. Parasites are small aliens that latch onto your head and maul you unless you can be healed. While these can induced frustrating and quick deaths, they are a challenge that forces you to stay together with your medic.\n3) Aliens - Of course they had to be in here! While not in to much variety, the types that there are make the game interesting (and sometimes a pain in the ♥♥♥!).\n4) The weapons - You unlock weapons as you level up. Sentries can provide a quick escape from a quick death and the flamethrower is incredibly fun to use!\n5) Levelling up - Levelling up gives you a sense of achievement as you shoot the crap out of aliens with that amazing new minigun you just unlocked\n6) And finally loudout customization! - The game features 3 slots to change weapons, a primary weapon to kill things with. A secondary or piece of equipment. This can be more ammo, another weapon, a sentry etc. And finally the 3rd slot (forgot the name) which can carry passive armour, light attachments, welders (very useful) and other helpful things.\n7)It's free too! (almost forgot.\n\nIn summary it's a fun game but it has a small community which can ruin it. But all-in-all you might as well try it out because its freee!","November 15, 2014","true","5.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Every class also gets thier own set of unique weapons, the Officers Vindicator shotgun is a personal favorite.\n\nLevel design is excellent, but this shouldn't be surprising comming from Valve, the layout accomodates for both players and enemy AI alike, sporting choke points for players to cover one another from and ambush points for the aliens to really get the heat up, it's for this reason you'll commonly find yourselves forming a diamond-esque formation, so that a number of your squad is pushing the team forward whilst the others are stopping any potential attacks from behind as you attempt to complete your current mission objectives.\n\nYou wouldn't think it, but Alien Swarm is also very rich in atmosphere and story, littered throughout levels are several datapads, leading up to-and explaining what had become of the colony of Jacob's Rest - The location which the game takes place - and sound design helps to add the overall presence the game gives, the sounds of claws rattling throughout the vents of the colony, the punch guns give, giving satisfaciton with each shot fired and each enemy slain.\n\nAll in all, I feel like a criminal playing this game completely for free, the quality is far better than alot of other top-down shooters out there charging an insulting £10 price, if you have a group of friends or just want to go on a well constructed bug hunt with some randoms, I see no reason why you shouldn't give this a shot. A very friendly and active community, several weapons to unlock and try out, tertiary abillities to use, from grenades, temporary slow motion to missle barrages, Alien Swarm is a good time to be had by all.","July 13, 2014","true","54.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Tuck the edges under and neaten the loaf by rolling the edges to taper them slightly. Put the dogh on the baking tray with greaseproof paperwith the join underneath. Place the tray in a plastic bag and leave to prove for about 40 mins, until the loaf has doubled in size. Heat the oven too 200C, or Gas 6.\n\n5. Just before baking, gently rub flour over the loaf, then make deep diagonal cuts alo9ng the top, first in one direction, then the other, to make a criss-cross pattern. Bake for about 30 mins, until well-risen and golden brown.

I just wanted to try something new.\nAnd, well... this game gave much more than I expected it to give.\n\nIt's a great four-person co-op game. You and three other players take on the roles of a Marine squad dropped into a colony overtaken by an alien infestation. This takes you on a campaign consisting of seven missions, watching your squad in top-down view kick ♥♥♥.\n\nThe controls are the simplest, but that doesn't mean the worst: you move with WASD, aim with your mouse. It's bare minimum, but that's very intuitive and aiming is made a lot easier by this.\n\nThere are four character classes: Officers, which use powerful Vindicator shotguns with huge stopping power and also increase the abilities of their squadmates, Special Weapons who use heavy autoguns to mow down enemies, Medics who tend to the team's health and Techs who are able to use tools better than others and perform hacks. The game offers two characters in every class, each one with different abilities (for example, between the two Medics, Faith is faster and a better Medic overall, but Bastille is tougher, better at combat, and gets a bonus to using adrenaline shots). This not only allows you to choose a character of the required class that will suit your playstyle, but also puts a hard limit on the number of duplicate classes a team can have (since there are two characters of each class, that means - go figure - up to two of the same class). Something a LOT of modern class-based games would use.\n\nIn terms of weapons, you get only a handful at the very beginning, and unlock more as you gain experience and level up. However, standard weapons are usually the most useful and reliable, with only a few really neccesary unlocks (such as a medigun. Yes, a frikkin' medigun. Which works just like any TF2 player would imagine it to work). This makes resetting your levels for cosmetic "promotions" not that painful, on the other hand.\n\nThe game gives you a variety of enemies to fight: other than the standard Drones, Rangers and Mortarbugs which attack at a distance, Boomers which are basically walking suicide bombers, Shieldbugs which require flanking and teamwork to hit their weakpoints, and Parasites which can infest and kill a marine very quickly, unless the Medic takes care of the victim.\n\nThe official campaign, while very short, has a high replayability, and the game also offers the fan creators development tools to create their own works.\n\nUnfortunately, despite its high quality, the game isn't too popular. You might find maybe 20-25 dedicated servers and 5-10 lobbies at any given moment. Speaking of the lobby option, it doesn't show you the ping of that particular one. You're forced to connect and then use the "ping" console command to check it. It's kind of a waste, but that's a technical problem that could be easily fixed, and doesn't really matter in the long run.\n\nOverall, this is a very, very good game. I highly recommend it to any survival horror fans, as well as shooter players and co-op gamers. It would be a sin to not at least give it a try.","August 1, 2014","true","57.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Also, the game's camera angle is used similarly to Dota 2 and LoL.\n\nAnyways, the gameplay is amazing. If it's your first time playing this, I would suggest playing Offline Practice, before you start playing Online.\n\nThe basic plot of this game is that you are a team of 4 Space Marines, and you're fighting against the Alien infestation. Also, this game is objective-based, so you have to work together to accomplish them.\n\nOverall, this game is good, with no PvP, but Co-Op instead.\n\n8/10","August 12, 2014","true","12.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skillless/recommended/630/","skillless","Peashooter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skillless/","238 products in account","It was a couple of summers ago. A friend and I had nothing to do, and we got bored of the usual few games that we engage ourselves with: Left 4 Dead, Team Fortress 2 and so on. We ran out of things to play with empty wallets as well. We were students, merry, but poor, and then we saw this new free-to-play game on steam known as Alien Swarm. No harm giving it a try, right? Little did we know that we will be spending the whole of our summer rolling around a blue-themed spaceship setting aliens ablaze.\n\nAlien Swarm is not a big project or game in particular, or so to speak. There is only one campaign of 7 maps to choose from, and the game itself gets repetitive in the long run. Still, what makes this game fun and captivative is the co-operative nature of this game and the array of weapons the game offers. Choosing the right class and weapon will be highly beneficial for the game play as having the right setups will shorten or lengthen the gameplay by up to 10 minutes, and there will be a drastic difference in reward as well. Since this game uses a leveling system, it will mean that one of the best case scenario is to look for a map where you can do quick runs (in a minute or two) over and over again so as to accumulate the largest amount of experience in the shortest time possible.\n\nOne thing I am found of for free-to-play games developed and published by valve, especially Alien Swarm in particular, is that there are no micro-marketing. Meaning, every single item in game are attainable through a little bit of hard work and grinding. It’s free, and if you have the time to spare, what’s your reason for not trying?\n","June 12, 2014","true","104.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

And it's -not- FPS (though I hear you can make it go into first person view). Unfortunately at the time I played there weren't any other people to play with, but that doesn't make it any less fun. Even the default offline mode was fun.\nI do wish it had more maps and levels for offline/single player as well and/or online solo maps for beginners.\n\nEdit: Wrote a new, more proper review below:\n\nI feel like this is a really underrated game. It’s a shame people almost no longer play this game, because I just really enjoyed it. It's light, it's cool, and it's sci-fi. And it's -not- FPS (though I hear you can make it go into first person view). Unfortunately, during the time I had it installed and played there weren't any other people to play with, but that doesn't make it any less fun, as you can go into single player mode. Even the default offline/single player mode was fun… for a while.\n\nThe game is a pretty typical top-down shooter with a leveling system to acquire better upgrades and weapons. It’s actually quite nice, if not overly original (group of marines hunting down bug-like aliens). The graphics and sounds aren’t anything to write home about, but they’re not bad either.\n\nI do wish it had more maps and levels for offline/single player as well and/or online solo maps for beginners, though, because as far as length it’s quite short, and after playing it over and over on your own it gets rather boring. I know you can manually install different maps, but it just becomes a hassle, as the game doesn’t have workshop integrated.\n\nThis is really a game best enjoyed playing with friends, and that’s how I recommend you play it if you’re interested.\n\nAnd the best part of all? It’s free! ;)","June 24, 2014","true","3.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skillless/recommended/630/","skillless","Peashooter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skillless/","238 products in account","It was a couple of summers ago. A friend and I had nothing to do, and we got bored of the usual few games that we engage ourselves with: Left 4 Dead, Team Fortress 2 and so on. We ran out of things to play with empty wallets as well. We were students, merry, but poor, and then we saw this new free-to-play game on steam known as Alien Swarm. No harm giving it a try, right? Little did we know that we will be spending the whole of our summer rolling around a blue-themed spaceship setting aliens ablaze.\n\nAlien Swarm is not a big project or game in particular, or so to speak. There is only one campaign of 7 maps to choose from, and the game itself gets repetitive in the long run. Still, what makes this game fun and captivative is the co-operative nature of this game and the array of weapons the game offers. Choosing the right class and weapon will be highly beneficial for the game play as having the right setups will shorten or lengthen the gameplay by up to 10 minutes, and there will be a drastic difference in reward as well. Since this game uses a leveling system, it will mean that one of the best case scenario is to look for a map where you can do quick runs (in a minute or two) over and over again so as to accumulate the largest amount of experience in the shortest time possible.\n\nOne thing I am found of for free-to-play games developed and published by valve, especially Alien Swarm in particular, is that there are no micro-marketing. Meaning, every single item in game are attainable through a little bit of hard work and grinding. It’s free, and if you have the time to spare, what’s your reason for not trying?\n","June 12, 2014","true","104.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

For another, it allows you to play Source mods without owning Half-Life 2, which is awesome. But really, Alien Swarm is a fun game to play with friends. Ignore the singleplayer mode (mostly because of the crappy AI) and you have essentially a top-down version of Left 4 Dead: Aliens Edition. Certainly not the best game available, but it's definitely worth checking out.","January 9, 2011","true","3.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Gameplay is a combination of TF2 and L4D with a little wiggle room on the weapon types. L4D since it requires four players, and TF2 with four classes. My pet peeve with this game is that it only has one campaign, and since it is like so many years old without any updates, the online community is nearly dead. Pick up a friend to play this game and have a good time for a bit. This game has so much potential, and I hope to see a big update soon or Steam Workshop Integration.","April 13, 2014","true","6.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I discovered this game when I was an f2p n00b in tf2, I got killed for the thirtieth by some guy wearing the Alien Swarm Parasite and it was awesome looking to me, and I would stop at nothing to get this hat, I looked up the hat name online and found it was a promo item for this game. I did some more research and found that the game was free, and in my mind I was like: "Awesome hat. Free game. Must download.".  And so that's that, I found this freaking awesome game, played the **** out of it, and now it sits in my steam library begging me to play it, and I do every once in a while. The biggest let-down was when I first played the game, I thought it would be some awesome popular MMO that would be the best game ever, and when I finally did play it. It was like some run-down depressing bar that I just walked into. The thing that ****** me off about this game, specifically Valve, is that they just said it was an expirement to see if a game like Left 4 Dead would work, and the free-to-play section of the steam store. I would pay Valve to continue support of this game such as updates and the steam workshop.","April 5, 2014","true","16.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I discovered this game when I was an f2p n00b in tf2, I got killed for the thirtieth by some guy wearing the Alien Swarm Parasite and it was awesome looking to me, and I would stop at nothing to get this hat, I looked up the hat name online and found it was a promo item for this game. I did some more research and found that the game was free, and in my mind I was like: "Awesome hat. Free game. Must download.".  And so that's that, I found this freaking awesome game, played the **** out of it, and now it sits in my steam library begging me to play it, and I do every once in a while. The biggest let-down was when I first played the game, I thought it would be some awesome popular MMO that would be the best game ever, and when I finally did play it. It was like some run-down depressing bar that I just walked into. The thing that ****** me off about this game, specifically Valve, is that they just said it was an expirement to see if a game like Left 4 Dead would work, and the free-to-play section of the steam store. I would pay Valve to continue support of this game such as updates and the steam workshop.","April 5, 2014","true","16.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grifreaper09/recommended/630/","grifreaper09","Dapper Prinny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grifreaper09/","570 products in account","Alien Swarm is an interesting game. Interesting in the way it plays, and the ideas behind it. When it first came out, it was expected to be a simple base for people to mod with. Not an uncommon feature for a game, since there are games just for modding like Gary's Mod. Yet, Alien Swarm didn't change that much once released. The community didn't mod it, and those that did never made much head way.\n\nBut thats beside the point. The game is great for some fun times. The co-op campaign is fun, and having someone there to cover your back is nice. Aliens come from everywhere. From the vents, holes, cliffs, even a few test tubes on certain levels. You can spot some entry points easily, but always be ready to turn around and fire after a few seconds. Aliens also tend to swarm you from behind if you move too slow. The game is meant to be a run and gun through the hordes of aliens, often running back once you reach a dead end. It also offers a nice variety of aliens, from the standard minion to the hulking tanks. Each mission is unique, and always challenging when played again.\n\nThe only downside is that finding a group to play with is a bit hard. While the game is free, very few people stick with it. For many it will be a simple beat the campaign, and move on game.\n\nSo grab it, play it, and have some fun.","September 24, 2014","true","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Helped me come to accept that Steam wasn't malware :P.\n\nSome people say that the community is dead, or bad.\n\nIt's not, there's still a large number of pro players active.  Many welcome new players.  Some times when you try to find a game, at that moment, there may be none available.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.\n2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.\n3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.\n4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed\n5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.\n6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.","January 11, 2015","true","1.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game play revolves around classes that have specific roles on the battlefield. These classes include officer, an all around class with added bonuses for the team. The special weapons, a class that uses a variety of unique and powerful weaponry to blast through the enemy. The medic, a class that is there to look out for the team with their healing capabilities.

There is also a varied amount of weapons and gear to unlock and have fun with for each class.

I downloaded it for free, thinking it would be another overrated zombie shoot-shoot-shoot game. But instead, I am pleased to tell you that this game worked it's way onto my top 5 games of all times list. The third person isn't annoying to play with, the campaign isn't too easy, or too hard. That is, the official campaign. Even if you buy this game, and get blown away after two days, like me, you will be mildly dissapointed to find only one real campaign. Jacob's Rest isn't terrible, it has a solid storyline, and a well-rounded difficulty. This is a Valve game though, and that means we, the community that Valve knows and loves get modding materials, and that's all it takes. You can create your own maps or mods, or play on somebody else's custom campaign, or just grind with your friends for levels in the regular campaign, and it never gets old. Overall, this game receives my 9/10 rating, second only to some other masterpieces of video games.\n\nBUT.\nThere is no perfect game. That means Alien Swarm has a few, very select, very small problems. First of all, I feel the weapons and progression system is a little weak. I think there should be a little bit more of a variety of weapons to choose from. Second, there are a small amount of bugs and glitches, as in any game. These include that glitch on the reactor level at the very ending.\n\nIn conclusion, I ABSOLUTELY reccomend this game for your library. As it is a completely FREE game, with NO in-game purchases possible, it will be no problem. If you do get it, send me a message, as I would love to play through a campaign with you.

It is a purely cooperative game where a team of four players must clear stages by completing various objectives. The enemies are AI controlled, insect-like aliens. The game supports forty weapons and items, has multiple character and class options and allows creative players to create their own content.\nAlien Swarm uses a simple lobby-based system where players can create or join matches. It is possible to join public channels, or to play alone or with friends.\nPlayers do gain levels, unlock achievements, new equipment and other features as they progress.\nUnfortunately there is only one single official campaign which is composed of seven maps.\nAlien Swarm is a good free game which brings several hours of fun. The fun would last longer if there were more maps available.\nAll in all for fans of cooperative games it is a good choice to try it out.\n\nSounds 7/10\nGraphics 7/10\nGameplay 8/10\nAtmosphere 8/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","June 20, 2013","true","72.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","1"

The roles in it are: Leader, Medic, Tech, and Special Weapons. The loadouts are limited. The options can feel endless. Some areas are dark. Some areas are harmful. Some aliens are harmful. Some aliens are REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING HARMFUL. There are also certain elements in it that require Medics and Techs. When someone dies, they stay dead until after everyone alive gets to extraction or everyone dies. It can be very easy to die. Simply being serperated in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ spot can lead to being surrounded in a corner while reloading and a very quick and painful death. Some say being eaten alive is a rare delicacy in some cultures.

I can't even imagine playing it alone or with mostly strangers. The game has nothing new to offer and the gameplay is pretty much all the same throughout the game, unless - unless you play it with your friends who are the same kinds of space, alien, sci-fi, comic books, fantasy and so on freaks as you are. Then you're gonna have a goooood time playing the game as a four-member squad in narrow corridors, snowy space stations swarmed with, well, alien swarms, you're gonna split the duties on opening the doors, downloading data, guarding the ones doing so, rescuing your friends overwhelmed and left behind, panic when those frakking little pieces of whatever you wanna call it jump on your back and poison you or your friends and you're trying to save them, watch your friend flawlessly handling a shotgun in desperate last stand of your soon-to-be gone epic squad. I wasn't expecting anything and anytime we play this we have a great time. Partly because we kind of roleplay the game when we play it, but Alien Swarm is really a enjoyable game when it comes to the multiplayer experience where you expect fun only","June 22, 2014","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When someone dies, they stay dead until after everyone alive gets to extraction or everyone dies. It can be very easy to die. Simply being serperated in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ spot can lead to being surrounded in a corner while reloading and a very quick and painful death. Some say being eaten alive is a rare delicacy in some cultures.

Alien Swarm is actually based off an Unreal Tournament mod, so the game is now in Source. The game is kind of like L4D in my opinion. You're fighting waves of killer aliens with weapons. The system of leveling is an ok feature, with time spent in it to unlock more weapons and equipment. The game itself is very short, only 1 campaign in the official launch. I hope this game can pick itself up and bring more potential, it is a good game but is lacking in some features.","December 18, 2010","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As it may have been stated before the modding community has made the game even better in some ways. Maps, missions. All of it is fairly worth. Also a great engine.

This game is intended to be played as coop for up to 4 players, each player can pick different classes and choose equipment in every mission, resulting in a huge variety of tactics and splitting of domains. As you complete missions you gain more experience and level up to get more equipment and skills (the better you play, the faster you level up). Both weapons and items offer a huge diversity and a load of fun.\n\nThe atmosphere is brilliant and leaves no room for wishes and the game offers more content than most games do nowadays (I would be still playing if there would be more content.).","January 6, 2014","true","33.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Alien Swarm is actually based off an Unreal Tournament mod, so the game is now in Source. The game is kind of like L4D in my opinion. You're fighting waves of killer aliens with weapons. The system of leveling is an ok feature, with time spent in it to unlock more weapons and equipment. The game itself is very short, only 1 campaign in the official launch. I hope this game can pick itself up and bring more potential, it is a good game but is lacking in some features.","December 18, 2010","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/630/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","If someone understand the game...\n\n... it wouldn't be me. I mean, the plotline is just Starship Troopers without the big army and the corporation hiding the truth. But anyway, it seems that the Swarms is a hate story with mankind when reading the biography of the characters.\n\nAnyway, you're just arriving a mining colony not answering calls, you already know that there was a problem, else you wouldn't be here and you have to get through to understand how they got swarmed by the aliens. You're beginning in the landing bay to finish into Timor Station, with a baby nuke bomb to escort. You're passing by the surface, by the reactor room or the residential area with labs locked down without forgetting your little trip in the sewer and the famous cargo elevator scene where everyone is shocked by a famous lag that is just in reality a slow motion scene.\n\nThe plot isn't really evolved by the PDA, seeing how short are the levels and the time you don't have to read them. So if at first glance, I was pleased by the turn of the events in-game, the lack of information prior the incident is just being making something amiss. I'm perhaps too used to Doom 3, Max Payne, FEAR or Legendary where you get a lot of clues about what's happening or how you got into the nightmare.\n\nSo the gameplay isn't intuitive at first: you'll have a time to adjust to that. If moving is just being the hardest part, the rest is really simple (not if you're not knowing all the keys): you just shoot swarms, you heal people if you're medic, you hack computers if you're tech.\n\nBecause you can choose between eight characters, two by classes, with special weapons. Everyone is unlocking the same weapons but not every class can use them. I'm explaining: the Officer is typically your common character you're meeting in the game: not heavily armed, without real speciality. The Specialist is the Heavy Weapon guy, carrying heavy miniguns. The Medic is the doctor you're going for if you're wounded, only him can carry enough health for everyone. The Tech is just your hacker, he's the only that can break into computers or some locked doors. If the Tech is really needed, having him dead is making the mission restart.\n\nYou have to earn XP for leveling up and getting unlocks. Everything is determined at the end of the mission, with the stats of it, if you earn achievements (or if you repeat them - for example, you already have the one with healing an infected marine but you can still earn XP for it if you keep healing people with parasites) or with the difficulty of the mission.\n\nAlien Swarm isn't really the game with magnificent tracks, apart the sounds from the Swarms, the voices for the Marines or the music track indicating that you're gonna be swarmed or under adrenaline effect, you have nothing. No music menu, no music in the lobby leader, just random sounds. It's maybe a free game but it could have been given some good music. After all, play a game from Ben Crosshaw or Grundislav Games and you have always a serious soundtrack.\n\nI must say that for a free game, the graphics are good, without real graphic glitches. As you're seeing all from top down, you need to recognize the Marines: white is for Medics, yellow for the Techs, green for the Officers, Blue for the Special Weapons and each of them has a different design, so, it's really easy to recognize them. The enemies are also well done, as the levels. The only little negative point are the bodies around the base, that are looking like nothing. Apart that, each level is adapted to his name, so, you're in a residential area (with labs near), you'll find offices but also a gaming room, sleeping rooms, bathrooms, etc.. If you're in the sewers, you'll be walking in water for example.\n\nIn other words, Alien Swarm, despite my initial reluctance to play it (it's not a FPS, I was just getting the hat), managed to chase my fears, to surprise me and to make me love it, even if it will never be the same love I'm carrying for my FPS games. So, I recommend it to any people searching for a good co-op game.","November 19, 2010","true","81.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

From what i'm told the original designers gave away the game to valve for money so the game never get's any new updates. Though this may be true, that didn't stop the community from making hundreds of their own custon maps to fill in that empty space. If you keep digging you will eventually find good players. Most people who play try and get the Team Fortress 2 hat. And it is quite intertaining to get them killed and see them rage.

Alien Swarm is a top-down shooter where you and three other teammates work together to survive aliens and complete mission objectives. It's so much fun to beat a really hard level with your friends or to clutch a win with 1HP. The upside to this game is how it's actually pretty difficult and requires teamwork and some thought as to your loadout and what classes people in your party should be. Also, the missions are all very different and consist of different sections, including offense and defense. You should get Alien Swarm and play it with three of your friends and use your mics.

However if you want a challenge, id up the difficulty but wow. I also like the levelling up system, as it gives you new weapons and things to help you survive. (Flamethrower at level 10/11 though!!!) However some users may want to turn the volume down to hear people in voice chat. the game can also be very laggy and send you to the other side of the map :/ also might want to fix some of the maps as ive found whilst playing with friends some places are easy to fall through eg.) under one of the bridges. and we had to restart the mission.","June 24, 2015","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The recently released PS-Exclusive Helldivers looks like a direct clone of this game.\n\nAs of this writing, the community is quite thin.  One 7-mission campaign is available for free, with lots of community levels floating around, but no official content was ever released. Co-op multi-player games like this live and die by map rotations, and years of no official maps have very much killed the player base.\n\nA stock levelling system controls weapon availability, and many interesting weapons make repeated missions interesting. An early update enabled repeating the 27 levels with higher EXP requirements, but this just makes the grind to unlock weapons more grindy.\n\nA free and very fun game, not without it's blemishes, but definitely worth the time and attention but try to bring 3 friends along, as finding random to play with is a lost cause.","October 24, 2015","true","144.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When I first started playing it I almost gave it a 'Not Recommended' due to the fact it was near impossible to find anyone willing to play. I tried and tried and decided to give it one final shot which finally rewarded me with a playable game! When we finally got in game I had a great time though blasting my way through aliens and trying to keep my teammates alive.\n\nKeep in mind it seems that Valve has abandoned this game. Understandable seeing as they weren't really making any kind of money out of it though. You're not going to find any DLC unless you search for community mods even though the story seems to have alot more to it. It's also very hard to find any other players that actually care about the achievements, if you're into that. The game is good for a few play-throughs but it's fairly unplayable if you're trying to go beyond normal mode or trying for any group achievements.\n\nStill, the game is free, so you can't really go wrong! 3/5","June 1, 2015","true","20.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The recently released PS-Exclusive Helldivers looks like a direct clone of this game.\n\nAs of this writing, the community is quite thin.  One 7-mission campaign is available for free, with lots of community levels floating around, but no official content was ever released. Co-op multi-player games like this live and die by map rotations, and years of no official maps have very much killed the player base.\n\nA stock levelling system controls weapon availability, and many interesting weapons make repeated missions interesting. An early update enabled repeating the 27 levels with higher EXP requirements, but this just makes the grind to unlock weapons more grindy.\n\nA free and very fun game, not without it's blemishes, but definitely worth the time and attention but try to bring 3 friends along, as finding random to play with is a lost cause.","October 24, 2015","true","144.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's pick up and master and you got this.\n\nGame: The game has a decent amount of ranks you can get through, always levelling after max (12) and fennel resetting and getting a special tag, go 12 more and reset and getting a better badge, kinda like Titanfalls system or cods system of ranking up.\n\nSadly the campaign is very very short and you will often want to download other creations to play to play through, but even they are short too. So this game is short at best.\n\nThere are some great difficulties to choose from and if you want to push then insane/ hoard... You will run out of ammo before the first door and why this is made is beyond me.\n\nThe game is coop which is awesome, seriously awesome, you'll see alone in this game is boring.\nAlso the game is free to play so how can you pass this up....\n\nWould I recommend?

Then when we really got deep into the storyline things started making sense. It's an okay game if you're into that kind of stuff, but Jerome and I strongly recommend you read the book first, as it can be very confusing if you don't. Besides that I also didn't like the part where William says "...Steven stole that cactus' virginity without the proper consent of her father!!" because that's completely untrue, it was quite clear that he did get proper consent.\n\nSo anyways..
