Deck13 along with publisher Astragon Entertainment, what is this and did you listen at all to your fanbase?\nI don't even know where to begin, I clearly remember a dialogue about what the fans wanted for the follow-up and did you collectively decide to do the opposite of what they wanted in about every way imagineable?\n2 hours in Im hating everything about this game! Even the good aspects like its music and graphic design which is completely irrelevant in an economic simulator! Why would you focus on that...why?\n\nHere's a list of the top of my head:\n-The impossibility of micromanaging a fleet of ships when one day at normal speed lasts like 7 seconds. Even with pause this game feels like a chore since there's not enough tactical considerations to be made when in port. An AI-captain system would have been nice. Thou, that would automate the only gaming aspect of this release... so yeah... :-(\n\n-The attempt at a story...why, its an economic simulation game?!\n\n-The non-pause catastrophe. Which ironically is currently somewhat saved by what looks to be a bug (you can pause the game by double-clicking spacebar.)\n\n-Developers haven't done anyhing to add in fun gaming elements to break up the monotony. Sending the exact same 3 versions of every ship type around in ports picking up the same-sized identical cargo with little to no variation until the end of time. Or some arbitrary deadline if you play campaign. There's just no decisions to be made in this game of consequence.\n\n-Whats with the horrendously random repair costs automatically accepted every time a ship comes in? (ships that currently also detoriate way too fast. Don't think a ship goes from 100% to 33% condition in like 2 months time...)\n\n-Are there any pop-up events or gameplay or anything happening ever in this game? Nearly 8 hours in I've not come across anything that wasn't better in the first version in the game. (which was just the "docking and undocking"-minigame when tugboats were on strike)\n\n-Why is the AI driving back and forth between just two docks in the first tutorial like tug of war OCD-victim?\n\n-The simplicity of the economy simulator. Let me re-iterate: The simplicity of the whole point of a game like this. A sequel should ADD to the complexity, not SUBTRACT from it.\n\n\nDear Deck13. Did you even playtest this? How about listening to your fanbase the next time around instead of wasting everyones time with this possibly meme-creating epic disaster of a game? I keep seeing you guys mention that people wanted multiplayer in this game. Were you listening to the players actually playing your first game, or the few not in your targetgroup which has no idea how next to impossible it is, making a game like this play in real-time?\n\nYour target audience are NOT people who like to frantically click their fingers stiff in some headache-inducing RTS-mode to beat the map before anyone else. They are methodical empire-builders happily spending minutes in port with each ship weighing their alternatives if enough options are given them. Often grinding for hours on end in a relentless "just one more turn"-mode until the early morning birds are chirping away...  And thats just finishing the first three months of play.\n\nTL:DR\nTo anyone considering this game:\nDo not buy at this point. It's the plague incarnate. (aka modern gaming developers focusing on nothing of relevant importance in their genre games catering to none in their actual audience)\n\nPro:\n-the UI is functional, mostly because there's no complexity\n\nCon:\n-everything else.\n\nedited 11th of may.(completed 2 campaign chapters with silver and gold. I couldn't bring myself to start chapter 3.)\nP.S: Music is no longer good. I tried it turned on for 4 hours.

Port graphics have changed but not for the better in my oppinion!\n\n\nCons:\n\nMuiltiplayer - could it not have just been an update for the first game?\nGraphics - dont appear to have really changed at all apart from world map and port screen.\nGame Play - Exactly the same as the first game no real changes inculding with the two new ship types managment of them all is exactly the same whats the point?\nManual Berthing (subject to change) - appears to be gone even though the controls are in the options menu!\nDry Dock -  In reality ships go into dry dock aproximetly once every two years not every month as they degrad so quickly!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHowever to be honest there doesnt seem to be a noticable difference bettween the first and new games apart form the introduction of two different types of vessels, which on a management stand point to start with appears very, very basic! There is litterly no difference to the management of tankers/container/bulk ships what was the point in adding them???\n\nGraphics no real change that I can see and I am running on Ultra. The only change I have noticed for the benifit of the player is the world map appears more visually attractive! And although the port screen has had work on it, I personaly feel it looks worse!\n\nAlso I am hoping I simply cant find the option or figure out how to manualy command the vessel in and out of port like in the first game, it appears to haven been removed?!?\n\nWhat the hell is sabotage doing in the game? What is this Airline Tycoon now??? Thats all I have to say on that matter!\n\nBrokerage of second hand vessels can occur anywhere in the world why have you limited them to certain ports. I can understand ship yards and dry docks in kimited places but the rate of degregation of vessels needs to be radically decreased and ship yards need to be confind to new builds.\n\nAll in all I have to say im severly dissapointed! As someone who works in the industry I was looking forward to a new, more indepth approch to the first game. With a more hands on contract stage(managment), and a more realistic set of physics for the manual handeling of the ships when berthing, as the first was awful (arcadey, nothing close to realistic).\n\nIn my honest oppinion it feels like they are trying to flog you the idea of a new game when infact all they have done is add two new catogories to the ship market, neither of which really bring anything new to the game, as the contracts work exactly the same as in the containers/first game (litterly no readily apparent change). And multiplayer which should have, and could have been an update for the original.\n\nFeels like they've removed more than added!?!\n\nThese are my opinions and I hope they help you decied if TransOcean 2: Rivals is for you or not!","May 10","false","11.0"," 68 of 82 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","68","82","2","0"

Unfortunately for myself and for a lot of die hard TO1 fans, this is not something I was waiting for. My preference is for proper business simulation game, which I prefer to play in endless sandbox mode.\n\nFor endless mode players, there still are some nice new features - I summarise 3 that I find most interesting:\n1) You can gain regional points, allowing you to build subsidiaries in different ports which also generate profits\n2) There are now 3 different types of vessels: bulk ships, container ships, tankers\n3) You can play against AI competitors\n\nThis being said, I share the view of many other TO1 veterans that the depth of the economic simulation could still be improved - this has not been the focus of the developers. More economic realism is needed as the game in endless mode is to easy to play. You start with a capital of 20m EUR and you are a billionaire after a year. Wish real life was like that...\n\nA lot of us have shared their wishlist of things to alter and fix. I won't go into detail on this here, but I have good hopes the developers will look at this in earnest. They have proven in the first week to be very responsive wrt the biggest complaint (lack of a pause button, now fixed), and I hope they will use the weeks to come to address some of the suggestions made by TO1 veterans.\n\nAll in all, I like this game a lot, but its current gameplay is not sufficiently addictive. A bit more work is needed to make it a top game, but I'm giving the developers the benefit of the doubt that this will happen in the weeks to come.\n\nBernard","May 16","true","29.6"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","0"

Do not waste your money.\n\nWhat was presented as a promising and entertaining game/simulation is far from what is expected. Horrible gameplay mechanics are fused with an inadequate UI that together are about as refreshing as Ghandi's flip flop on a hot summer's day. The constant battle against the inexorable timer to get your cargo in before its deadline passes, mixed with an AI that is always far more powerful than the player even on the easiest settings, leads to a feeling of emptiness. I feel all used and neglected after painstakingly investing 11 hours of my life in the hopes that it would get better.\n\nI particularly disliked the story. It's a joke. The way the goals are laid out it doesn't really make sense. They somewhat contradict each other. I'm all for something that's a hard challenge, but there's got to be some light at the end of the tunnel. So far it seems the only way to progress through the laughable story is to manually choose every contract, which then leaves you in the ineviable position of not being able to take a holistic approach while you frantically find the next contract before you send the boat on its way. And therefore you end up losing out on neat little Subsidiaries to the AI's 'Mongol Horde' approach.\n\nThe performance of the software, is poor. It slows down far too quickly and leaves your computer whimpering like it just did ten rounds with Mike Tyson on adderall.\n\nAre there any positives? No. Wait! I might, I might just get my money back if I'm lucky.\n\nWhy is it not possible to see which ports are size limited? I have to take a huge guess and a leap of faith to discover if it's just too big to fit.\n\nWhy can't the automate cycle actualy do something useful? Why is it unable to be told which speed you would like to set it at... Why can't it keep doing that cycle until I tell it to stop? By the time you get to six ships you just don't have the time to do anything but fill them with contracts. Yes Automator, this is where you step in. Only it's that inept that you might as well be urinating onto an icecap in a bid to melt it.\n\nDon't even bother giving this a go. It is by far the most miserable gaming experience I've ever had. I'm a patient person, and will happily admit I don't get them straight away... But after 11 hours, surely I should be feeling like I'm enjoying it? Not just growing ever more frustrated.\n\n\n","May 12","false","11.3"," 33 of 46 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","33","46","3","0"

For starters what is new? New vessels such as bulk and tanker vessels, however, they all play the same have very different benefits, The region points system, this system allows you to get benefits from a region by building subsidies and collecting a profit share off of those buildings. There is also now multiplayer which in itself is a mixed bag of nuts, on one hand, I love being able to take on my friends and see who can make the biggest company, however, dont expect to build a shipping empire on multiplayer(ill get into that later). Now what is all the fuss about, well there are a lot of drawbacks from the first game for example in the first game managing a fleet of over 10 vessels was possible (now not as much) the automation system shuts off after running one pattern and doesn't make money so you'll be stuck with notifications that ships need orders. The next system is the sabotaged system which consists of 3 options: bribe subsidies, call in a notification of contraband, freeze bank account. In multiplayer the only real useful one is the contraband call, freezing bank accounts is annoying but does literally nothing to the player other than waste money. Speaking of multiplayer here is where a lot of shortcoming with the game show them multiplayer is great, sorta... the fact that we can to take on other humans makes planning and competing for more fun and more challenging HOWEVER multiplayer is incredibly restricted and I've yet to have a game where I'm able to buy a tier 5 ship by the end of the match, another issue is even while hosting you can't control any of the settings other then sabotage on or off, and game time at 1hr,1.5hr, 2hr this time restriction make 0 sense why cant we play endless or set better goals a good way they could make multiplayer 100x better is by allowing the host to set the goals of the game, by setting the victory conditions such as first company to own X amount of ships, first company to hold X amount of regions, first company to hit X value will win. This would make multiplayer not feel like such a crapshoot another thing would be able to join a game mid game allowing the multiplayer menu not to look like a Gamespy server. The last to MAJOR drawbacks are the UI everything from TO1 that worked so well got completely screwed up the UI is annoying and confusing even for a returning player. The last thing that I have no doubt in my mind will end up changing is the price 25$ is a way to steep for this game currently with all the bugs and drawbacks however if the devs listen to the community and change a lot of the problems it would be worth 25$ easily. However even if the devs don't fix a lot of the drawback the game is still worth picking up on a sale for around 5-10$.\n\nTL;DR version\n\nPROS:\nLots of new content\nMultiplayer!\nNo more forced goals\nmultiple game modes\nthere is now a pause button in single player\nmost issuses can be fixed through updates easily\n\nCONS:\nHUGE LACK OF MULTIPLAYER CONTROL (pointless restrictions)\nTerrible and confusing UI\nNo loans\nControlling a large fleet is near impossible\nyou cant see the cargo loaded on the ships anymore\nvery high price for what you get","May 13","true","21.1"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","20","31","0","0"

The big element of this game is switch. It used to be focus to making a great single player game. Now the focus is set to a very crappy multiplayer game. Why did they do this? My thoughts is the people on TransOcean 1 discussions page complaining about a lack of multiplayer. Not every game needs a Multiplayer. special when it is shoehorned in like this.\n\nSo the game boils down to is earning points to spend those points on land. The land will give you money. So you can then spend that money on ships to earn more points to get more land. That is the whole game. The game is ment to be played in a skirmish MP style. Where there will be goals for you to get to win.\n\nThe worse part is people think this is an unfinished game. Which it pretty much is a finished game. It was just focused purely on this crappy mp gameplay.\n\nBuy TransOcean 1 and let your wallet do the talking. Now if they should ever remake this game. Going back to TransOcean 1 and dropping this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MP play style. Then you might want to give it a try.

Now it is fixed as well as some bugs. Now it more resembles a tycoon game it is supposed to be and is marketed as. Some of my complaints remain unfixed like being able to repair ships only in designated ports (I think it would make more sense to make it possible to repair your ship in any port, just make prices different), but it seems this game now is going to direction it is supposed to be. It still has some technical issues (like resolutions over 1920x1200 are not supported so if you have 4K or 2560x1440 monitor – you are out of luck, play in windowed mode or not fully use your resolution). There still is no easy way to quickly get to the port that your ship is standing in from list of ships menu.\n\nNow I can give it a careful recommendation if you are into tycoon or management games. It still has some issues, so I would recommend to wait for some more patches to come out before buying it. If you did not played the earlier game this might be more friendly to you, because it has a tutorial and should be more easy to learn for newcomers. If you played the earlier game this is not much different, but it contains new types of ships and campaign missions, so it is upon you to decide if it is worth the asking price for you.","May 12","true","14.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

After playing for 10 or so hours I find I just don't enjoy this version, I'm finding it just frustrating to play.\n\nCampaigns are a mutha to achieve even a simple 1 start rating in order to advance.  Some chapters are easier than others, but after chapter one, I don't see how you're going to achieve more than 1 star and even then it's pretty garsh darn hard to do so.  The AI should be gimped enough to allow at least a basic win for all but the must inept of players.\n\nThe User Interface needs added features with the added diversness of the ports.  Okay, you can't get repairs at every port now but the interface should show icons of repair ports at least so you don't have to memorize repair ports from the world map.  Port features  also need to be added to contracts display for route planning.\n\nThe coloring/customizing of your ships is a huge downgrade, you get just one bland color now.  I understand why they did it for simplicity of multi-player identification, but...  YUCK!  Especialy in contrast to the beautifully scenery.  I suppose it doesn't matter as my ship RARELY shows up in the port views, wasn't until Chapter 3 mine even bothered to show up.\n\nSo, how are we supposed to sell those old, smaller, junky ships now?  Once their ours they are forever ours?\n\nStory continuity and game play don't sync.  The sister moves on in chapter three and her brother takes back over while she returns to feed her dogs.

The game is one whole click fest especially when you either get multiple ships or on the later levels. Time passes so quickly when you are looking at contracts you have literally seconds to accept them or bang they are gone.\n\nNumerous times have I been furious clicking on missions to a certain port only to find the list has shifted up slightly and I have added cargo to a completely different port (hence losing me money through penalties)\n\nOn that note lets talk about the way the game handles payments etc, say you haul a load of stuff and its says your bonus is £1.2 million there are certain deuctions that dont make sense especially when you get charged for wear and tear on your ships but for that money they are never repaired.\n\nOn the note of the ships, seems to me that the sea is made of acid or some kind of corrosive substance as your ships decay at an alarming rating so in some scenarios you are left with a choice of either fixing a rotting ship or buying a new one to increase profits etc.\n\nTo be fair I was saying to people hold off buying the first game and buy the sequal instead but after playing the campaign mode and not being interested in multiplayer I would have to say the first game is superior to this one.\n\nDont get me wrong I am a big fan of the empire\tycoon money making genre but this is just done wrong.\n\nEdit after patch please read.\n\nWell it is a pleasant surprise for developers to actually listen to customers. (EA and others take note)\n\nThere has been a patch to this game and so far it has improved the single player game no end.\n\nThe addition of the pause function has turned this game from the click fest it was before the patch to a proper strategy business type simulation game. It gives you time to think out your moves instead of widly clicking contracts because you have 20 seconds or so.\n\nAnother patch that has occurred is that they have slowed down the ship decay rate so it doesnt feel like you ships are sailing in seas of acid anymore.\n\nMy only major grip still left is the exclusion of a 2560x1080 mode as I have big black lines down the side of my screen and in todays world 2560x1080 is pretty standard.\n\nBut I do have to give props to the developers for fixing most of what was wrong with the game and it is now enjoyable to play so i revise my rating from negative to positive","May 12","true","29.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

So give them the chance to fix it and do not judge after 2h gaming!\nI didn't play TransOcean 1 and therefore don't miss anything.","May 11","true","18.1"," 6 of 22 people (27%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","27","6","22","2","1"

At the point where you have 4x50million ships you will make so much money you can buy a new ship very often, and even with 4 ships they come and go so often that you very much do nothing more than sit and select contracts all the time and seeing your other ships just sitting there doing nothing waiting for you to finish and giving them a new contract while the days passes by since there are no pause function. This is good but once you have many ships you simply will see pop up messages all the time and it ruin part of the gameplay. YES you can make your ships automatic them self choose contracts and sail arround, but i did not my self try this much. Never the less game became borring after a few houres and I doubt I will play it again.\n\nThough I do not like the game much, then it is a nice game like "ports of call"  and there are allot of different ships to choose from, and you can sail in all of them in and out of the harbour now and then wehn tugs are on strike.\nGame have many nice features such as the harbours and sailing the ships ( arcade style ).\nand you can upgrade your ships in many different ways from cooling containers to the ability to sail with illegal goods.\nYou can even sabotage your enemys ships with ordering costoms check for illegal goods if and they pay heavy fines if cought smuggling.\n\nAll in all nice game, just get borring very fast.","May 10","true","2.7"," 4 of 19 people (21%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","21","4","19","0","0"

You simply hit space bar TWICE, the menu pops up and then closes.  You can then do whatever you want in pause mode and then click the button or the numbers 1,2,or 3 to speed game again.  Don't know how that could be overlooked as I figured that out in less than 5 minutes.\n\nI will come back to update this later... right now I want to play it.   I never had TO-1, so right now this game looks pretty cool.","May 10","true","3.6"," 7 of 32 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","7","32","0","0"

Check ***Update*** markers for changes.\n\nProblems:\n-I understand no pause in multi-play, but why in single play?  I always feel rushed and can never take time to plan things.  What is the point to all the ship stats, you don't have time to read them, your ships are arriving in port now.  What is the point to the ships finiancial stats, you don't have time to read it, your ships are arriving in port now.  What is the point to the contract list, you don't have time to read it your ships are arriving in port now. = Not fun.\n\n***Update***: This has now been fixed with a patch. :)\n\n-There is a feature that lets you plan a ships route 4 stops in advance, but it costs an insane amount of money so don't use it if you are not a tanker.\n\n-Bulk ships are not a viable starting ship.\n\n***Update***: Now that you can take your time to plan, the starter bulk ship can work.  The trick is to upgrade the ship right away or it will never make money. (Still a tough one to start with.)\n\nThe orignal game with bulk ships and tankers would have been much better than this.  A little tweak to company contracts, a tweak to to the jobs list, a tweak to how you can drive into port, and poof a great improvement.\n\nBottom Line:\nI liked the original game much better.  Don't be in a hurry to buy this unless they patch it.\n\nI am not asking for a refund, I am hoping they patch it.\n\n***Update***: They patched it.  Simply adding the auto pause makes all the difference in the world and it is possible to get into this game.  I have chnage my review to recomend. :)","May 11","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"
