As for the difficulty the game presents I found myself finding it came down to a memory test combined with trial and error much more then any skills came into the game.\nThe graphics of the game are fun, with some nice little touches on the animation and all characters and objects look like they belong in the same game. From time to time a couple of extra touches would be nice to take this area from competent to good.\n2 extra mini games one based around reversing the roles where you play "Piro" and try to survive as long as possible. The second seems to come down to a reaction clicking game.\n\nFind the game enjoyable but still have major doubts over how long the game will stay entertaining. Nothing world changing and not a game to get if you can only afford one, but if that is not you worth a try.\n\nGameplay footage:\nhttps://youtu.be/6bKaQVrZs_U","April 29","true","1.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"
