I remember playing the campaign and enjoying it and being scared by the zombie mode that was unlocked upon finishing the game. During this time I didn't have internet so I couldn't play online. Due to this I always played with my dad. I believe that lasted for a couple months and I begged my dad to get the internet set up so I could play with other people. Call of Duty: World at War was my first online game and it was a great experience.\n\nCampaign:\n- I would say the campaign in this game is fairly average, but one of the best Call of Duty campaigns.\n- You can play all, but two missions cooperatively.\n\nMultiplayer:\n- Personally, I thought this game had the best multiplayer out of all the Call of Duty games. I loved playing Hardcore          Headquarters, Hardcore Search and Destroy, and War.\n- Unfortunetly, this games feels basically dead these days and I don't really see a reason to play it.\n- On PC there is a problem where you get kicked from games for no reason by Punk Buster.\n\nZombies:\n- This game comes with four fun zombie maps upon purchase.\n- There are loads and loads of custom maps to play\n- Four player coop.\n\nI honestly can't think of any negative things to say about this game.

While everyone says its a copy and paste of cod 4 its a good one and i'm glad treyarch made a ww2 version of cod 4 because the ww2 cods were great. If your wondering where all the dlc is its included in the game and its a good price for the base game and all 4 map packs.\n\nCampaign:\nThe campaign is really cool and it proves the struggle that the russians had during the germans rise to power. Its one of those games that are so gorey that it makes you grateful that you didnt have to go to war and it makes you apreciate the army's work, for example you shoot someone in the arm and it will fly off and blood will splatter everywhere, shoot someone in the head with a shotgun and the enemys head will fly off, shoot someone in the leg and both legs will fly off. The story is great, you play as 2 different characters in the campaign: Dimitri petrenko (russian) & private C miller, On the American side you play as private C miller and you escape torture and raid the japanese camp that you escape from and continue to fight the war. It leads you through a long war that will keep you going for ages. For example on mission 2 theres an easter egg that lets you have a ray gun and mission 3 you get a flamethrower and another badass american mission is when you play as a commander on a ww2 plane and you feel like your raining death (a bit like death from above from cod 4, as i said this is a ww2 version of cod 4).  The russian side where you play as dimitri is probably the best part of the campaign because it has the more badass missions. You start off by being in the middle of a massacre at a town square only to meet sergeant reznov who helps you avange the massacre. You continue the campaign trying to regain control of the reichstag (end 2 missions of the campaign) but through that journey you murder as many germans as you can, you even go to their homeland and murder them there. Theres also a russian mission where you drive a tank as means of transport. The ending of the Russian campaign (end of campaign acctually) is badass and im not going to spoil it, just youtube it or play the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• game.\n\nOverall i think the campaign is great and worth the price inculded in the game, i rate is 8/10\n\nMultiplayer:\nI dont really play much of this, probably a quarter of my hours but i stopped playing because of how many hackers are in multiplayer. Just like cod 4 you have 5 create-a-class slots with a primary weapon and 1 attachment, a secondary weapon, an equipment slot, 3 perk slots and a vehicle slot (yes some maps you can drive a tank). There is a great gamemode called war where theres a flag you have to capture and the more kills you get the faster you can capture a flag, im not going into to much detail because thats pretty much all war is. The maps are surprisingly really fun and i really enjoy them.\n\nOverall i give the multiplayer 7/10 because of the hackers, if there wasnt hackers i would give 8/10\n\nZombies:\nThis is probably my most played part and it is because of custom zombies. Custom zombies is really fun and the people out there create some amazing maps maybe even better than treyarchs default map. I wouldn't suggest playing co-op zombies unless your playing with a friend because people will steal your window and you get people on the mic but if you play solo or with a friend you save yourself from the migraines. The 4 default zombies maps are included (nacht der toten, verruckt, shi no numa & der reise) and they has some really nice features (shame that only der reise has pack a punch). There are 4 perks in zombies to which is very obvious (quick revive, speedcola, juggernog and double tap). Quick revive is a self revive on solo which means when you down you can get back up but you only have 3 uses, juggernog increases your health from 2 hits to die to 4-5 hits to die, speedcola makes you reload double fast and double tap lets you shoot 2x as fast. The guns are good but not amazing unless you have the ray gun or unless your on der reise and can pack a punch (pack a punch gives you a cool camo and shooting sound and doubles, qtriples or quadruples your gun damage, not sure which).\n\nOverall i think zombies is the best part, I wouldn't mind paying ¬£20 for the zombies on its own but I rate the zombies part 9.5/10.\n\nOne last note: If anyone does buy the game or enjoyed the review please thumbs up as this is the first review I have spent very long on but if you do get the game please send me a friend request, I'm always looking for friends on zombies but anyways buy the game and I promise you will love it.\n\nThanks for reading ;)","May 5","true","64.7"," 135 of 145 people (93%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","93","135","145","13","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/10090/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Call of Duty: World at War is the fifth game in the COD franchise, releasing in 2008 on PC, PS3, PS2, Wii and Xbox 360. The game was developed by Treyarch and published by Activision. This game is set in the World War II era where you play as various soldiers from United States and The Red Army.  Please note that this review is purely based on the single player aspect of World at War.\n\nThe gameplay shares several features with the rest of the COD franchise up to this release. You spend the majority of the time with at least one other AI controlled squad member which guide you through levels and keeps you up to date with your current objective. You may only carry two weapons at any one time, whilst also having access to smoke grenades, Molotov‚Äôs and hand grenades. We have all of the standard FPS mechanics like crouching and prone positions. You recover health by staying out of line of fire of enemies, since there is no ‚Äúhealth‚Äù packs throughout the game. You know when you are getting close to death as the edges of your screen glow red and your heartbeat increases. I personally think this is a nice feature rather than relying on a health bar, it adds to the immersion of the gameplay as the UI is very minimal.\n\nSince this game was released almost eight years ago, the graphics are certainly starting to show their age, with some really low res textures, but the environments are all still really nicely designed, animations on everything is stellar too. Character models are all high quality too. The game‚Äôs sound effects are brilliant too; you really feel like you are under heavy fire from enemies when you have surround sound on with a sub.  The fully voice acted characters are also very well done too.\n\nThis is one of the few COD games which I had a few moments of difficulty throughout the campaign. Usually with COD games your AI partners are able to carry you through most levels with little interaction from you needed, however this game is different.  The tank missions are the ones I found to be the most difficult as you really need eyes in the back of your head in order to avoid taking damage from the hundreds of enemies that have you in their sights. I am not condemning the game for difficulty; it is really refreshing to see a COD game has the challenge in it. The more recent COD games have become a walk in the park so it was nice to see something different here.\n\nWhilst the game is linear, there are a few collectables to find throughout the single player campaign, there are 13 ‚Äúdeath cards‚Äù to be found on every level which unlock cheat modes when playing in co-op. This again is a really cool feature and gives you some incentive to check every room, nook and cranny to find the collectables rather than a pointless achievement.\n\nThe only negative point about this game for me is the game‚Äôs length. I realise I only played the single player so I am only getting half of the experience, but I would have liked to have seen at least five hour single player campaign mode. I managed to complete the game on a medium difficulty in just over three hours. You could replay the game to go back and find all of the collectables and you could also ramp up the difficulty, but given the linearity of the game I don‚Äôt see myself jumping into doing that anytime soon.  Looking at the Steam chart numbers, the multiplayer scene is really active still so if multiplayer is your jam you will find a match quite easily still.\n\nTechnically I only had one issue, and that is with the graphics on some levels. It almost felt like my graphics card was dying as there was spewing graphics all over my screen at some point. It is hard to explain how they looked, but they were really off putting to the game and only happened every few levels. A simple re-load resolved the issue thankfully.\n\nCall of Duty: World at War is one of the best games in the COD franchise and one that still holds its own in the current generation of games. Due to the single player‚Äôs length, the price point on this game is quite high at ¬£19,99. I would say that if you plan on getting into the multiplayer side of this game, you should pick it up for that price, however if you are only interested in the single player campaign mode, you would be better off waiting for it to go on sale, unfortunately reduction on COD games are very rare so you need to keep your eyes peeled for the deals!\n\nFor anyone who has just skipped a head to my rating; I will repeat, this game was reviewed purely on the single player campaign; please bear that in mind with this rating.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SavageBeastZero/recommended/10090/","SavageBeastZero","SavageBeastZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SavageBeastZero/","609 products in account","Introduction: Call of Duty World at War developed by Treyarch is now a beloved classic in the eye's of many Call of Duty enthusiasts and still incredibly sought after by PC gamers to this day.\n\nOverview: Developed by Treyarch Call of Duty World at War remains amongst the top of many PC Call of Duty fans wishlists and standard playlists years after release for many reasons. True to the series fluid arcade style FPS gameplay elements fueled by adrenaline and a constant gameplay flow. Call of Duty: World at War separates itself from the pack as the last true Call of Duty PC release.\n\nWith graphics optimization unheard of in this day and age of COD console ports to a modding friendly PC release, whether it be it's first forray in into Treyarchs now trademark Zombie mode or a multitude of community driven content in all aspects of multiplayer. Call of Duty: World at War is seen as the last title in the series to be given the full PC treatment gamers grew used to and has sadly never returned.\n\nFans of the series who have never experienced Call of Duty: World at War will be amazed at the amount of content available as a standard retail release. The PC Steam version of this title comes preloaded with the DLC preinstalled for $19.99 which, is why this title has never seen a price drop aside from activisions penchant for never letting their financial steely grip on price reductions slip through their fingers and benefit the consumer on the backend. I must reiterate this Call of Duty release simply doesn't need one. With all the content available in this iteration anyone considering a purchase will be more than pleased with their decision to opt in to the lesser known older brother of the Black Ops series.\n\nGraphics: 8.5\n\nJust as any other version of the generation 7 Call of Duty games this is also based on the 2007 Unreal engine which, means considering the amount of graphics optimization available Call of Duty: World at War in comparison to it's younger siblings still holds it's own in many aspects and more in some cases.\n\nGameplay: 8.0\n\nAlthough not quite as intricate as Infinity Wards fan favorite Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. World at War holds it's own where it matters.....Solid gameplay. This is a tried and true Call of Duty recipe since the originals release which I am happy to say is represented perfectly. Although a bit on the no frills side in comparison to Modern Warfare, some prefer it's tenacious gun battles and old school FPS precision beats killstreak style and should in the least be embraced by all "New school" Call of Duty fans.\n\nSound: 8.5\n\nA series staple. Call of Duty doesn't let down even by current generation 8 standards. Every whizzing bullet and explosion will test even the most high end of Dolby Surroud Sound systems subwoofers currently on the market today. When the settings are placed just right, you can close your eyes and imagine what an existance in this chaotic time in history would have been like. This truley helps set the tone in any true battlefield experience and World at War doesn't dissapoint.\n\nOnline experience: 9.0\n\nAfter all these years Call of Duty: World at War still has a thriving online vs. multiplayer community supplimented by a vast zombies experience that many consider to be superior to the franchises later releases. Due solely to the dedicated modding community that activision has sadly all but forgotten about in it's later releases. With that being said the multiplayer servers are also maintained by groups of dedicated FPS communities. One specific group that must be mentioned for it's servers integrity and organization is the [PDE] " PerfectDarkElite", this groups primary servers are maintained by some of the most friendly and integrity driven individuals that I can proudly say I have played along side for countless hours of intense online battles.\n\nStory: 7.5\n\nThe story of Call of Duty: World at War is what I would consider it's weakest point. Seeded in the standard World War II scenario, you won't find much originality here. Yet with that being said it still manages to keep your interest as any Call of Duty action fest should with the series standard over exaggerated explosions and barely made it through situations, World at War still has it moments of surprize and awe.\n\nReplay Value: 10\n\nWith all the above mentioned features preinstalled in the retail release and available from the online community this is where Call of Duty: World at War shines above the rest!!! If your looking to make a Call of Duty purchase that will last into future if the past is any example then World at War is it! With a lower price tag than it's younger brothers, every dollar is a dollar well spent. The replay value of this title is endless.\n\n\nFinal Review Score: 8.0\n\nThere are two defining Call of Duty titles from the seventh generation that not only set the standard for all titles to come in the series but, also simply couldn't be matched in terms of gripping single player campaigns to this day Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and World at War. Without a doubt Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is the superior of the two but, regardless there's a reason that Treyarch continued to base multiple entries on the gameplay formula represented here....Simply put because it's good and they knew it. If you are looking for one of the best World War II campaigns in gaming history and an online experience that still bustles today, then look no farther.","June 8, 2013","true","131.6"," 53 of 60 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","53","60","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FOTUG/recommended/10090/","FOTUG","daddys_darling69","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FOTUG/","52 products in account","Once upon a time, there was a Call of Duty game that, much like the others, recieved hate for being part of the CoD francise. However, it had many great things that people consider groundbreaking in newer CoDs such as gore and interactive map elements (in the form of tanks). Once upon a time, that game wasn't infested by hackers in multplayer. That game was Call of Duty World at War. A fantastic WW2 game that was on par with Brothers in Arms for showing how dark WW2 (or any war for that matter) was/can be. We had access to many weapons of devestation, from M1A1 Bazookas, to M2-2 Flamethrowers, and other feared weapons such as the MG42, or as many soldiers dubbed it, "Hitler's Buzzsaw." Explosives and large calibre ammunition showed their true power when they ripped apart characters limb by limb, the flamethrower engulfed and charred the bodies of soldiers in true awe. But the experience doesn't just end with a heroic end to a dark and gritty campaign and 80+levels of multiplayer, oh no, for an extra, small map had made it into the game; Nacht der Untoten, Night of the Living Dead. In a move that caught everyone, even many of the employees at Treyarch, offguard, an extra mode was added into Call of Duty that would be immortalized as a icon of the series. Nazi Zombies. Many players, myself included, spent countless hours having fun with this little surprise. And it didn't end there; more maps were added, and all Treyarch games since have had it included, as if the modding community wasn't putting out enough maps as it was. But its time was cut short when Modern Warfare 2 came out the next year and as the fanbase moved on, the hackers moved in, polluting the public multiplayer lobbies like a cancer, making people less inclined to play the game. And so ends the story of Call of Duty World at War... or does it? No, the game won't die for a long time because of its dedicated custom map making community, creating more and more great Zombies experiences each day.","September 6, 2015","true","17.9"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","92","34","37","8","0"

Brilliantly nostalgic and still an absolute joy to play. PunkBuster can be a problem however.\n\n"Call of Duty" was and remains a franchise at the forefront of the online FPS genre. Dominating both console and PC alike, it's rivaled some would say, only by it's EA counterpart "Battlefield"; but "World at War" was something else.\nReleased in 2008 it adapted and built perfectly on the foundations set the previous year by Activision's installment in the series - "Modern Warfare".\n\nTrearch's addition gave us features the likes of which we'd never seen in "Call of Duty 4". Vehicles. Tanks. Though on face value a simple addtion, their inclusion was well implimented and appropriatley balanced. We were also graced with a slightly new approach to the killstreak system, seeing the introduction of attack dogs; along with a tweaked 'Create-A-Class' system made to feel more period accurate, with bolt action rifles becoming an entierly different weapon type paired with the ability to use their iron-sights, as apposed to being restricted to a telescopic sight.\n\nIn terms of singleplayer, this installment saw you brave the horrors of WWII from both a Russian and American perspective; battling the Japanesse on Iwo Jima and beating down the 3rd Reich from Stalingrad to Berlin. Featuring the voice talents of Keifer Sutherland for the American Sgt. Roebuck, and Gary Oldman for the premier of the legendary hard-as-nails Russian sniper - Viktor Reznov. The campaign is both compelling and fantasicaly written with mixes of close and ranged combat along a spectrum of locales beautifully designed and planned. The singleplayer is, as far as im concerned, unsurpassable by any other "Call of Duty" game.\n\nHowever, my one biggest fault with "Call of Duty: World at War" is the unfortunate lack of PunkBuster support. The anti-cheat system which now seems abandoned and disused is still required to play some servers in online matchmaking. Needing some Google searching to find a download of the appropriate files to enable the system to work. Although once this is done, the game plays fine and without further fault.\n\nOh, and not to mention. Zombies.\n\nRecommended?: Yes.\nScore: 9/10","November 4, 2014","true","82.1"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","26","28","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xxsparkyxx/recommended/10090/","xxsparkyxx","Sparky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xxsparkyxx/","184 products in account","Campaign:\nThis is by far my favorite campaign in Call of Duty. The grim, brutal and graphic nature of the campaign really makes the game feel like World War 2, the deadliest war of all time.\nYou play as the Soviets against Nazi Germany in one campaign. You witness the beginning of the war with a grim scene of death and an enticing sniper battle. You then find yourself breaking into the heart of Germany and the destruction of the Fatherland. You also get to prove yourself as either an emotionless monster or a forgiving soul.\nYou also play as the American's against the Japanese. You will witness the Japanese banzai tactics and guerilla warfare. You will go from hot, dry out in the open fighting to narrow caves and muddy, rainy hills. You will witness the downfall of the Japanese Empire from start to finish.\nBoth campaigns are very enticing and the missions, although action packed, are memorable and the environment/scenes make it seem realistic.\n\nMultiplayer:\nThe multiplayer is fun, although sadly their is no matchmaking for PC like their is on console. You have to search through the list of servers. A lot are crouch servers/tactical servers which can be a +1 or a -1. I'm personally fine with it. Game also comes with all DLC's so you get all the maps.\n\nZombies:\nYes, zombies. The masterpiece of World at War. It all started here. You get all the zombie maps, plus there is hundreds of custom zombies maps that make the zombies experience endless. This is a big highlight of the PC version. You can easily play with your friends. You can do cheats as well. I'd say the zombies is the best reason to get the PC version over the console versions.\n\nGraphics:\nPretty nice for their time. I wouldn't criticize it since the rest of the game makes up for it.\n\n\nOverall 9.5/10\nI take 0.5 off for the lack of matchmaking. Otherwise I love WAW and have played it on my friends accounts and have spent atleast 100 hrs on the PS3 version.","December 10, 2015","true","34.4"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","26","28","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yomamacrank/recommended/10090/","Yomamacrank","Yomamacrank","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yomamacrank/","380 products in account","Call of Duty: World at War. The last game before all the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• PC ports of the Call of Duty series. World at War (WaW) is the fifth iteration in the arcade shooter series that brings WWII elements in the COD universe. WAW is Made by Treyarch a company that has made titles such as "Call of Duty: 2" and "Call of duty: 3", so if you have played those you're in for a similar experience just much more shiny. The COD series also has another developer (Infinity Ward) that switches off on each of the series's games. WAW brings a whole new part of the series. A 4-Player cooperative game-mode named "Nazi Zombies". The new experience compiles intuitive gameplay like finding the best parts of a level to kill the undead or find out what weapons do the most damage.The campaign is 5-8 hours of Shooting mindless enemies on set pieces arranging from the heart of Russia to Nazi trenches. The multiplayer is class based with a perk system and customizable weapons. If you manage to get a certain amount of kills in a row you earn special kill-streaks. 3 kills is a UAV, 5 kills is an Artillery Strike, and 8 kills in a row you call in dogs to rip your enemies apart. Overall Call of Duty: World at War is a great buy if you like shooting up hordes of zombies all night with your friends. Or if you want to have a good time killing your way to the top in the leaderboards on multiplayer. Either way your going to have a good time with this game.","November 28, 2013","true","38.6"," 34 of 44 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","34","44","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pixar900/recommended/10090/","pixar900","Pixar900","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pixar900/","114 products in account","In my opinion, this is a nearly perfect game. It has an ok story, but you will overlook that very quickly as the gameplay and atmosphere captures the horror of World War 2 flawlessly, in both plot lines. In the first plot line, you play as an American soldier battling the Japanese, trying to capture an island that is full of booby traps and relentless enemies. This is a very cool way to play, with close quarters combat and ambushes aplenty, making the gameplay very suspenseful. In the other plotline, you play as a Russian soldier, firstly trying desperately to survive during a massive German invasion of a Russian town, then four years later, in 1945, you enter Germany and Berlin and brutally crush the German empire in what is a very satisfying set of levels. The first mission where you play as the Russian soldier is absolutely groundbreaking, filled with suspense and a dark, powerful atmosphere as you try to escape from the overkill that are the Nazis. Gameplay is your average Call of Duty game, it's fun and addictive, but on harder difficulty modes, it is extremely frustrating. Even on the easiest difficulty, you can bet that enemies will throw 3 grenades all aimed at you with no time to react. The Campaign is very entertaining and while short it has plenty of powerful moments, ESPECIALLY the ending, that was one of the best moments in a game, ever. The game looks absolutely beautiful, for a person that has to run PayDay 2 on lowest settings windowed to get 30 FPS it looks fantastic, even on lowest settings. The music is stunning, even right when you start the game you hear a track that grabs you into the game. Sadly, Campaign Co-op is dead and no-one plays it, so be sure to get friends if you want to play the Campaign with someone. Multiplayer is very good. On the XBox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game, it is notorious for everyone to hack and spoil the game. Oddly, on the PC version, where it is far easier to cheat, you barely see any cheaters. In general, Multiplayer is very well alive and still has a lot of players to this very day, which is good, because multiplayer is very entertaining and amusing to playthrough online. Last, but certainly not least, the arcade-style Nazi Zombies mode. This is one of the best modes ever to be added to a video game, and would you believe it was added last minute? While the Zombies mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops is flawless and (for some extra money) contains all the WaW maps remastered, it's still incredibly fun, and if you ask a friend to play Zombies with you, they usually accept. Overall, this is an excellent game and one that should definitely be in your Steam library. Just, don't get it full price, for this old of a game paying ¬£20 is just plain stupid.","December 15, 2015","true","23.5"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","18","19","4","0"

All the DLC is included free of charge so you don't have to mess with paying more for zombie maps. Also, there are tons of custom zombie maps that people have made so you will pretty much never get bored of zombies. The game is incredibly user friendly when loading up custom zombie maps from online so you don't have to install any bull sh*t mods or program to use them. Also, while there are some mediocre zombie maps, there are also a ton of well designed maps that in some cases due to easter eggs or new features outshine the ones that the game comes with. To add, because zombies on Black Ops 1 and 2 aren't exactly mod friendly, custom map makers have turned to integrating a lot of BO1 and BO2 zombies features in World at War. From guns to perks like Mule Kick and extra pack a punch features like cool looking skins for guns when you pack a punch it, these custom maps become more than just a room with spawn points. Hell, there's even buyable endings where you can literally beat the map after you rack up enough points depending on what it's set at (do not confuse buyable with actually having to buy and ending with real money, it's all using the in game points so don't worry about having to pay for extra sh*t. Though this may seem like a lot, or a little if you're a skeptic, this is just a surface level review of what there is to offer in this game through custom zombie maps. You do not have to pay for any map that you download (that I know of) and there's plenty of ways to get these maps. Personally, I just go to youtube and watch well known zombie players playing custom maps that they think are cool and conveniently they link the download to the map. Pretty trusted resource cause, you know, the internet would never lie to me.\n\nAnyways, here's a TL;DR\n\nGet this game mainly for zombies. All DLC included and custom maps are easily available and easy to use. IMO the custom maps are better than the original ones. Worth.\n\n10/10","January 2, 2015","true","17.3"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","21","27","0","0"

And despite some obvious shortcomings, like the broken audio and straightforward story, World at War is every bit as intense, polished and fun as it's predecessor. The presentation is top notch, with cutscenes that mix real wartime footage with sleek, modern graphics. The short singleplayer campaign is helped by a terrific multiplayer and co-op portion as well as the ever fun Nazi mode. World at War doesn't reinvent the wheel by staying snugly in Modern Warfare's shadow, but it does make for a thrilling and enjoyable ride that fans of WWII and shooters alike are sure to appreciate.","April 17, 2011","true","2.2"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/savedbythebell/recommended/10090/","savedbythebell","Watties -__^","http://steamcommunity.com/id/savedbythebell/","225 products in account","To this day, Call of Duty: World at War still holds up as one of the greatest first person shooters of all time. To give a full perspective on the game, I will do this review in three parts:\n\nCampaign: Probably the weakest aspect of the game, but still fun to run around play through World War II environments. Its story feels a bit less personal and epic as some of the other titles (Modern Warfare, Black Ops), however it isn't by any means bad and can still be enjoyed. The mechanics of the campaign can be somewhat odd, with things like random grenade spawning which cause a bit of annoyance. But, on the whole it's still a fun time. World at War also has a co-op campaign feature, something that has not been seen since in the series.\n\nMultiplayer: This is where World at War really shines. In general, the game is designed around being skill based, and as such you are rewarded for being a good player. Now, that doesn't mean there isn't the occasional iffy mechanic in the game (martyrdom), however most of the time you earn your kills and deserve your deaths. The TTK (time to kill) is higher than other games, making gun accurasy and controlling recoil key. The game has generally very strong maps (Castle, Cliffside, Downfall, Nightfire etc.), and each map generally accomidates to a variety of skill sets and has a variety of sightlines (again, reinforcing good aim and gun control being rewarded). All in all, this game has a near perfect multiplayer and to this day remains a great experience.\n\nBonus - Zombies: Although Zombies has come to be expected out of modern Treyarch Call of Duty titles, in World at War it was a hidden bonus mode that caught on like wildfire. That's right, World at War is where this whole zombies craze started. There are 4 zombies maps in total (although you can download additional countless ones via user created maps), including my personal favorite map Zombies map ever, Der Riese. However, every map is enjoyable. The biggest weakness in World at War's Zombies is the zombie grab, which can often cause frustration and being automatically down with no chance to get away. However, if you're good enough, you can avoid this for the most part. Although future games are more refined (and brought these maps back), World at War Zombies is still an incredibly enjoyable experience, and has an endless amount of mod content.\n\nExtra and Closing Thoughts: As I mentioned in the Zombies section, there is a wealth of moddable content for this game. This includes maps, guns, skins, modes etc., essentially creating a game you can spend an infinite amount of time and never be bored. In addition, PC players got ALL of World at War's DLC Content for free! However, it is worth noting that the community [as of mid 2014, 5.5 years after release] is slowly dying out, and you could eventually run into an issue finding a desireable game. That being said, this is an excellent game, one of my personal favorite FPS games of all time, and I highly recommend picking it up!","June 24, 2014","true","88.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

Infact it is one of the better ones. In the Singleplayer Campaign you switch between two fronts: The Japanese-American and the Russian-German Front. Both Stories are alright, but the Russian one has way more Character Development than the American One. The Multiplayer is your Basic Call of Duty Multiplayer, but with (of course) WW2 Guns. The Multiplayer has small, but also some Bigger Maps. On some Big Maps you can even use Tanks to destroy your Enemies. After beating the Capmpaign you unlock the Zombie Mode "Nazi Zombies", which is the best thing about this game. Fight the undead horde round by round as long as possible. Arms yourself up with guns and perks and slay em all >:3. This game also supports mods. There are many mods for this game which add more zombie-Maps to play on. The modding Community is still active. If you like WW2 and Zombies CoD WaW is the game for you.","October 9, 2014","true","28.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatCristianGuy/recommended/10090/","ThatCristianGuy","ThatCristianGuy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatCristianGuy/","169 products in account","TL;DR at the bottom\n\nMy second favorite Call of Duty!\nOhhh my god this game! THIS GAME! I can't express to you how much I love Call of Duty: World at War. It's an EXTREMELY close second to Black Ops 2. This game was fun back in 2008 and is still fun to this day!\n\nCampaign:\nThis is the last WWII game in the franchise which was sort of a bummer for some people. However, the campaign was really great. It was very long, you were always at the edge of your toes to see what happens next, lots of different gun variety, and you could even play the ENTIRE campaign MULTIPLAYER! This is the only Call of Duty game that let's you do that. Something that I think all the Call of Duty's should let you do.\n\nMultiplayer:\nMultiplayer is amazing  especially  on PC. I have this game for both PS3 and PC. While their may be more people playing it on the console version, the PC version is not hacked and there are community made mods like modern weapons, different gamemodes, and many more. Of course you can play your traditional / old school / classic World at War you know and love, but you do have variety. All matches are hosted on dedicated servers and all of them  can  go up to 64 PLAYERS! Not all servers are like this, but a good ammount of them are. The console version only went up to 18 as the max. So if you like classic World War II Multiplayer type shooters with a lot of gamemode variety, you'll love this!\n\nNazi Zombies:\nThis is where the game really shines (in my opinion) ESPECIALLY on the PC. If you've played WaW on PC, you know exactly what I'm talking about: CUSTOM ZOMBIES. Now before I go into that I'll go over original zombies first. WaW has only 4 zombies maps to choose from. You can play all of these Singleplayer and Multiplayer. This is the game where it all started. Thanks to Treyarch allowing mods for World at War on the PC, you have endless possibilities of different maps you can get. You can Google: "Custom Zombie Maps" and you'll get a bunch of results from different websites and map creators. If they could add Steam Workshop to this game, it would be WAY easier to get mods and custom maps for both Zombies and Multiplayer. World at War Zombies on the PC is HANDSDOWN one of the best Zombie experiences you'll ever have in a video game!\n\nTL;DR / Summary\nOverall, Call of Duty: World at War is one of the best Call of Duty games in the world! It is a must buy (in my opinion) if you haven't already tried the game out yet. This is one of the few cases where I recommend you get it on PC over console, because this is one of the fewer Call of Duty games that are SO MUCH BETETR on PC. Call of Dut: World at War is a fun experience for Singleplauer, Multiplayer, and Co-op and is a must have for WWII and Zombie fans!\n\nOverall rating 9.5/10!","January 26, 2015","true","75.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","3"

I've been playing this game for a long time, even though It says I've only got 70 or so hours at the moment. My favorite gamemode is by far the zombies, don't get me wrong, the campaign and multiplayer are fantastic. But the zombies is where this game really shines in my opinion.\n\nPros:\n-Awesome story\n-Huge multiplayer maps with vehicles\n-Extremely realistic hardcore mode\n-Zombies\n-Custom, downloadable zombies and multiplaer maps\n-An actually quality level PC port\n\nCons:\n-Small-ish community\n-Very hard to get into low-ping public zombies servers\n-Graphics are outdated (not that it really matters to me, but it's a con for most people)\n-Crashes happen when you try to switch your online profile\n-Tanks are OP (as they should be, but its none the less annoying)\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\nOverall, You could have many hours of fun with your friends in this game. If you have no friends who play this game, it is less of a rewarding experience. If you do buy this game, I would highly recommend playing through the campaign, it is really worth your time.\n\nSCORE: 9.5/10","December 8, 2014","true","79.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Story Mode/single player- I found this game's story quite good though it's very laggy and hard to get into at first I give it a 5/10.\n\n2. Story Mode/Co op - when playing the story mode with friends my game as well as theirs would crash for no appearant reason and i have yet to find the cause i give the co op story mode a 2/10\n\n3. Networking/match making - when joining a co op round with a friend in rare times either person was unable to join the other's match and i have yet to find a cause or a fix to this issue and it is quite rare i give networking/matchmaking a 6/10 for all around.\n\n4. Solo mode zombies - I find this one of the best modes of the game i love it the most cause i can sit and play even with out cheats and go Very far in waves or rounds and have music playing with out worrying about my team mates i give solo mode zombies a 10/10\n\n5. Co op Zombies - I find it hard to find a match for zombies it's sometimes none existant when it is most of the time it's modded maps or people using cheats of some kind but for just private matchs with friends i give the co op zombies a 10/10 for online use i give it a 0/10 because i can't play in a public match because it's mostly private premade teams now.\n\n6. Multiplayer - I like the Multiplayer of world at war but most of the servers are either using cheats or mods and it's extremely hard to find a match enless you custom search one for with out mods or cheats that is in the game mode you desire, Also with most servers the health is very low that being said in most servers the bullets that it takes to kill you are around 3 to 5 rather than almost a full clip depending on the right happen i find this a major disappointment because it's hard to find the guy and shoot him before he shoots me and most times it's a one shot from accross the map so i give multiplayer a 6/10.\n\n7. Graghics/ effects - I have yet to put these through their paces because i'm still running on low settings because my laptop sucks but when i get my new computer and re run this game at max i'll revise my review and add my rating on these but for now i can't.\n\n8. Sound effects - I have to give the sound effects a strong 9/10 they are superb 99 times in each match depending on the weapon.\n\n9. mechanics - the game is old that being said i can't even give it a strong review on these because of it being as old as it is so i'ma give the mechanics a 10/10 for them being as old as they are\n\n10. playerbase - This game has good playerbase alot of nice peopl and such and it's very easy to get a co op or co op zombie match going this being said i give it a 10/10\n\n11. Taking out of all my reviews i give the entire game a 8/10 for it's age and the fact that in some features i can't really put them through their full potential yet i will however do so when i get a better computer.","November 25, 2014","true","125.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The story mode is rich and exciting. Multiplayer is still very good to play on. I've had little to no trouble finding games and the servers have very few if any cheaters on them. Because it is a call of duty it uses the same gameplay mechanics that the most current one uses so to this day it still feels like a modern shooter.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/notanoriginalidea/recommended/10090/","notanoriginalidea","LightninG","http://steamcommunity.com/id/notanoriginalidea/","80 products in account","CoD: World at War, is EASILY one of the best Call of Duty games ever made. First off, the game goes back to its WW2 roots, after the giant success which is Modern Warfare. The single player campaign is solid, it really helps that WaW focuses on some of the less popular battles from World War II, instead of giving you battles on D-Day at Normandy, which would have been like the millionth recreation within a WW2 game, the game covers an American campaign across multiple islands in the Pacific, as well as the Red Army's comeback at the battle of Stalingrad, which leads up to the Fall of Berlin. All of this provides lots of interesting new battlefields. You will still see some more familiar spots within bombed-out cities, and the farmlands of the Eastern Front missions, but it is all still incredibly well done. War, as you probably know, is an unforgiving and brutal affair, but the Pacific and the Eastern Front were especially so. In the game, Japanese soldiers will swarm you out of bushes, erupting straight out of spider holes and charge straight at you in an attempt to run you through with their bayonets. They'll play dead and wait for you to walk into the middle of a trap. Although the game is primarily set outdoors, most of the game is played in close quarters combat. Meanwhile, on the Russian Front, there are plenty of absoulutely merciless moments to be had. Soldiers on both sides of the war on this front, Russian, and German. Soldiers of both sides gun down wounded or unarmed soldiers, and sometimes you're asked to pull the trigger yourself in situations like this. But, this remains a Call of Duty game, through and through. What I mean by this, is that the action is both fast, and fluid, and the game is rigidly scripted. Enemy soldiers, as well as your computer-controlled teammates respawn endlessy until you advance far enough to hit the triggers to make them stop coming at you. Then, you find yourself at the next firefight, and repeat the process all over again, but, you're usually far too busy ducking, and shooting your way around the level, and occasionaly dying, to really notice this much of the time. The sense of immersion is really outstanding. There are plenty of deafinging, large-scale battles, but there's also a bit of variation to change things up. A perfect example is the PBY mission, where man the guns of a Navy aircraft, while you are in the midst of a raging air AND sea battle, taking fire, and fighting for your life, while trying to save the lives of sailors stranded in the water. All of this sounds great, but it hurts the game in one way. The narrative skips over months at a time, and showcases the major battles in the campaign. The result of this, is that the sense of story may not be as strong as you would expect it to be. In the end, the single-player campaign is relatively short, but it doesn't drag on too long to be unenjoyable either. And, as a bonus, there is a lot of replayability in the story, because the bulk of the campaign is playable in cooperative mode, with up to three other players. Multiplayer (while it has A LOT less players than console, or than when the game originally launched) is an area where WaW shines REALLY bright. Modern Warfare, quite arguably had on of the best multiplayer suites in history, and WaW built upon it. There is a create-a-class system, and a ranking system, that lets you unlock perks, weapons, and other general upgrades, that you can use as the building blocks for tailor your own personal load-out, and play-style. Kill-streaks are in the game, and are simmilar to Modern Warfare's, but with a twist more accurate to the time frame of the game.\n(UAV=Spotting Plane, Airstrike=Artillery Strike, Attack Helicopter=Attack Dogs)\nThere is also plenty of game mades to choose from. Then, there's my personal favorite aspect to the game. Nazi. Mother‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing. Zombies. Nazi Zombies is a game mode, where you and up to three others are put together against an endless onslaught of neverending waves of zombies. As you progress the waves get harder, either by adding more total zombies, making them faster, or both. You gain points for killing zombies, and rebuilding baricades, and these points can be used to buy weapons, ammo, and to open doors granting you access to other parts of the map. There's even a mystery box, which costs 950 points for every weapon, that gives you a random weapon. One of those van even be a ray gun, straight out of 1940's era pulp fiction. And, as an added bonus on PC, you get all 3 bonus maps included with the game, which cost 9.99 each on console, and the wonder of custom maps. You can download a free, and safe map launcher, from which you can download maps made buy the community, with the same rules as before, unless changed by the creator. Overall, the game is PACKED with a ridiculously deep amount of gameplay, with appeal to almost every kind of player. All the way from those who want to experience a gritty solo campaign, those who want to play with their friends, and those just want to play the multiplayer. The game is an awesome addition to the franchise, with plenty to offer to the casual gamer, and the hardcore gamer alike.-----9.75/10","March 9, 2015","true","147.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xpliciit/recommended/10090/","xpliciit","Xpliciit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xpliciit/","178 products in account","Unlike with my Black Ops 2 review, this game comes as one game under your Steam Library but is a 3 part game, Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies. So i will be doing the one review for the parts individually.\n\nWaW - Campaign\n\nIts Veteran Campaign is the hardest campaign i have ever completed on any game ever.  Regardless of wether it is a CoD or Battlefield or friggin' The Sims, i don't care it's purely hard.  Unfortunately (Or fortunately in this case) the Steam version of this game does not have achievements so i cannot prove i have completed it on Veteren, and honestly i havent completed it on Veteren on Steam.  I completed the Veteren campaign on the PS3 version of this game a long while back before i started PC gaming. After having gotten every single achievement and my Platinum Trophy i vowed to never ever ever attempt this Veteren Campaign again.  As i said earlier unfortunately this version doesnt have achievements so i dont have enough reason to attempt such a feat again to prove my worth.\n\nI can assure you back in the day there was much rage, controller throwing and much swearing loudly. I have since barely ever raged again, im pretty sure it's because no matter how hard something is or how much better a player in a multiplayer game is than me, there is always this Veteren campaign that is harder.\n\nHaving said all of that i really enjoyed the campaign, despite it being clearly quite old by todays standards it's quite a fun campaign (as long as you are not attempting it on Veteren)\n\nWaW - Multiplayer\n\nThis game is old and this does reflect in the multiplayer games.  There are quite a lot of One Shot lobbies in the multiplayer mode, it seems to be the more popular due to how much fun the sniper rifles are in this game and how old it is too i guess.  You can find some normal team deathmatch games here too but its not a super busy game on the multiplayer servers from what i have seen, most people will have moved on to the newer CoD multiplayer games i imagine.\n\nWaW - Zombies\n\nThis is the game mode that you buy this game for. World at War created Zombies, this was the first ever CoD game to put a zombies mode in.  Having said that you only get one base map which isnt that great.  What is pretty great is that all of the DLC for the Steam version of this game is completely free so you can get 3 other zombies maps too. This is unlike the PS3 version i played many moons ago in which i had to buy all the DLC. The DLC Zombies maps on this game do pale in comparison to the newer CoD games with zombies but that is to be expected since its the first time they have existed in CoD.\n\nSo that is awesome you have 4 zombies maps just like the console versions.\n\nLOL. This is PC ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ES!!!!\n\nFor the PC version of this game you have a WHOLE COMMUNITY based on ZOMBIES.  There are literally THOUSANDS of Custom Built maps for this game. You can find such maps all completely FREE to download at many numorous websites that host links to maps made by Custom Mappers. You can see hundreds and thousands of videos on Youtube if you pretty much just type 'custom zombies' into youtube search bar to see huge varieties of maps. There are maps that are designed entierly from the map makers imagination or maps made based on real life enviroments wether it be the mappers workplace, house or local supermarket. There are maps based on TV shows such as The Simpsons, Family Guy, Spongebob Squarepants, My Little Pony - Yes i said My Little Pony!!\n\nEven i myself have made a few custom maps - the mod tools are free for anyone to use to create your own maps usually available from the many websites that host these maps alongside tutorials on how to use them and many forum posts giving advice on how to use them.\n\nSo that is why you buy this game pretty much only for the custom zombies maps, you could spend probably over 2000 hours playing every single map for like 30 minutes each easy with probably some maps you could spend a few hours playing.\n\nSome of the websites you can find custom maps and tutorials on how to make your own etc:\n\nzombiemodding.com\n\nugx-mods.com\n\nundeadmodding.com\n\ntriple-mgames.com\n\nand so on, there are tonnes of them :P","May 25, 2014","true","56.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I always make fun of cod for being mindless and such but this one is considered (to me) to be the best and I would recommend it to ANYONE.

I can start off by saying that it is the most  outstanding brilliant  game modded!\nBeing a modded game may sound bad but it does come with its advantages!\nMain advantage:\nModded Zombies.\nPeople mainly buy this game mostly for the zombies purely because the multiplayer servers for CoD: WAW is pretty much dead, everyone plays the later instalments of CoD but if you're a true zombie player like yoteslaya or yamimash, then you will love this game.\nThis game has the standard campaign and when you finish that, you will unlock a game mode called Zombies.\nZombies is a game mode where you will receive an endless amount of zombies going up in waves. E.g. wave 1: 8 zombies, wave 2: 14 zombies and so on.\nBecause this game is quite dated, it is easily modded and most of the modders live on a site called  www.zombiemodding.com\nThere are hundreds of zombies maps designed for CoD: WAW zombie players, modded to the extreme as they include;\nCustom Zombie maps designed by the community, not any standard zombies map\nGuns are ported across from MW1/MW2/MW3/Black ops 1/2 and maybe some AW guns in the future!\nPlayer models can be changed for example, in some WAW maps you can play as some of the characters from Black ops 1: Call of the Dead\nThe list just goes on!\nSecond Advantage:\nIt's not even that hard to download modded zombie maps, on the website www.zombiemodding.com they simply ask you to download an .exe file which will install the zombie maps in the directory C:\Users\<YOUR COMPUTER NAME> \AppData\Local\activision\codwaw\mods.\nIf you even wanted to design your own zombie map, it takes about a few days to learn how to do it and a good couple of weeks to finish of a piece of well-designed work. Not much code involved.\n\nHow do i play these maps?\nhttp://store.steampowered.com\nYou have to click the "MODS" option which will bring up a list of your installed maps.\nurl=store.steampowered.com] http://i.imgur.com/dralY4T.jpg [/url]\n\nGoogle chrome says these modded maps from zombie modding are malicious?\n\nI am not quite sure why google chrome says these maps are malicious, probably because they are .exe files. Don't worry, if you download them from zombie modding then they should be virus free, if not report them on the website.\n\nThank you for reading my review, if it's any good thumbs up so others can see.","December 27, 2014","true","85.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","4"

You can play coop with your friend for the story campaign from start to the end. The campaign story is quite interesting, and contains a lot of different aspect of war for you to experience: like being a captured hostage waiting to be executed, using a flamethrower to burn enemy fortress, shooting snipers out of the trees, and driving a friggin tank!\n\nThe zombie mode provides a lot of extra fun if you have friends to play with. Being an old game, there are a huge library of custom maps and mods for this game that are very stable and fun on the internet.\n\nBeware though. Despite being a very old release, I still cannot play it in high graphic settings. I need to lower my resolution to lower-than-average to get playable framerates.

Where as past Call of Duty games had light violence, World at War is the only Call of Duty game to feature full on gibbing, as well as bullet impaction gibbing. This and the chilling and scary atmosphere that is all throught the game, makes this the last modern Call of Duty game I've enjoyed ever.\n\nIt's Call of Duty, so you shoot opposing soldiers to get to the other end of the map. It's linear, and completely cinematic, but that never really bothered me in this game.

Led throughout by Resnov through some brilliant missions culminating in a remake of the original Call Of Duty's assualt on the Berlin headquarters the Russian segment oozes quality. The US section however is the weakest this time around which doesn't make it bad just not up to the standard of the Russian campaign.\nThe visuals in this game bring war torn streets and buildings of Europe to life like non of the previous games in the series and the enhanced body damage finally makes grenades and high powered machine guns satisfying as they rip through the bodies of your enemies.\nI find it difficult to decide which games is better between this and CoD 2 because this is a lot more linear in it's level design and CoD 2 has massive maps with multiple objectives.\nHowever WaW is a great single player campaign and also the first in the series to introduce zombie mode for added longevity.\nFantastic entry into the WWII series of CoDs and maybe even the best one.","July 12, 2015","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","6"

Of course, it's Call of Duty and you play it to shoot down endless waves of bad guys but I think it would have been nice to show changes in characters.\n-Historically awkward. For example, the only tanks you see for the Russians is the T-34-85, which makes sense because that was the most produced tank the Russians made but they had dozens of other tank models.

You won't like it. I can't say much for multiplayer or campaign aspects of this game, but the zombies and modded zombies are truly extensive and amazing. I think the greatest thing about a lot of the custom zombies maps is that they have an end other than the death of the player(s). All in all it's a game well worth the buy, but if you don't have much money just wait for a sale (Steam has a lot of those... LOL). If you are a Call of Duty gun nerd then this is certainly a good pick because the maps have guns from every Call of Duty ever. From the good ol' not-so-classics like MW3 to the new games like AW and BO3, you name them, they're there. Also the maps have a number of themes from holiday's to movies, even original ideas. Easter eggs are a large part of the good maps nowadays, you'd be unlucky to find a good map without a zombies gun game mode too!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sweatbandz/recommended/10090/","Sweatbandz","A_Sweatband","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sweatbandz/","254 products in account","Although I reference multiplayer, this review focuses more on Campaign and Zombies.\n\nCall of Duty: World at War is mostly good. The Russian campaign is very much close to the older Call of Duty games, and the introduction of Nazi Zombies was a signficant feature for Treyarch. However, World at War has key flaws that prevent it from being amongst the best of the franchise.\n\nThe game is a step in the right direction for the series however, with features added by United Offensive and the console-only Call of Duty 3 making a return, such as the ability to comandeer vehicles in multiplayer. Mod support is also a strength for this game in multiplayer, with custom zombies being a highlight of the game.\n\nThe campaign is okay. The Russian half is well done, featuring a mix of large open battles and tight sniping moments. The American campaign has more weak spots than the Russian campaign, such as the QTE's if a Banzai gets to close that can end up becoming a constant annoyance in the campaign, as well as the pacing, its just the worst of the World War 2 campaigns. The game on both ends tries to have you build emotional links with members of your squad, but the characters are not that memorable, outside of Reznov (which is probably due to him being a main character in the Treyarch games).\n\nEngine-wise, the textures are clearly quite low-res, even on maximum settings. The added gore is a nice touch, wtih arms, legs and heads being blasted off. This also leads to new animation assets not present in the gameplay of other Call of Duty games. Ultimately, the games visuals are clearly held back by the fact that the game is still using the same engine used in Call of Duty 2.\n\nUltimately, World at War is still a good Call of Duty game.The variety of missions, including tank commanding and airplane gunning makes the campign still stand out, the soundtrack, especially on the final Russian missions stands out, and the modding community continues to still expand the game with custom-made content. This game also includes all the DLC from the console version included in free updates. Although it isn't as solid as what came before, it still plays better than anything that came afterwards.","February 19, 2015","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was running a full 60 FPS flawless, even on the higher-paced Zombies mod, which honestly is the only saving grace in Call of Duty.\n\nThe singleplayer was pretty interesting, too; it was a cool campaign of WWII taking place on two fronts against two highly different enemies - the Japanese favor unconventional, barbaric and suicidal attacks which provide challenge for the close-quarters-oriented United States Marines, and Hitler's Angels go against the Soviets in a longer-ranged conflict.\n\nThe weaponry feels so unique and abstract from other installments of this otherwise putrid franchise, though that primarily comes from the gore effects in this game. Watching enemies' limbs go flying off when I blast them off with a pump-action shotgun reminds me of many years ago when I played this game on the Xbox 360.\n\nSo World at War provides an entertaining singleplayer, which also has the equivalent of Halo's "skulls" (difficulty and game modifiers that provide either more challenging or easier effects in the gameplay) and cooperative campaign gameplay (it did on the Xbox, at least; I'm almost positive it does on the PC), and the Zombies mode is at its strongest and purest roots. It's tragic when the series' (Zombies) origins are the best version of it.\n\nOh, and it's World War II, not this futuristic Titanfall wannabe ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t.

From action filed sinlgeplayer, and to fast paced zombies, this game will make you want to keep playing. The multiplayer is balanced with a variety of perks and weapons to choose from. With basic killstreaks and close quarter maps, there will be heat around every corner. If you want to play a real game, you can. Tons of players are stilling playing as you are reading this. Or, if you want some different gamestiles to chose from, there are always hacked lobbies and modded maps and games to keep you going. This was my first CoD game I had ever owned back on the PS3. I decided to get it again on PC, and I don't regret getting it again. Hands down, if you're gonna get a CoD, get World at War. Extremely balanced, extrememly fun.

Taking the series back to WW2, this game, rather than going to the classic and arguably overused setting of Western Europe (USA/Britain/Canada/etc vs Germany in 1944-45), you instead go to the Ostfront (Germany vs USSR) and the Pacific (USA vs Japan). One thing that is captured really well in this game is the dark and merciless nature of the fighting on these two fronts: you see executions of prisoners and unarmed soldiers trying to surrender (VERY common occurances on these two fronts committed by both sides), and a few times you are even asked to pull the trigger yourself. Ugly, but refreshing too since it ensures that this game isn't just another "America ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Yeah WW2" game where its good vs evil, but a much more realistic and morally grey experience. The history nut in me liked this little detail enough that this alone would make me recommend this game, if only to get a glimpse of how vicious the war between the Americans and Japanese, and especially the Germans and Soviets, truly was.\n\nHonestly though, it's a decent game for shooter fans too and not just crazies like me. Though this is also the game that introduced the Zombie mode to CoD, so that could be a potential turn-off for you. Still, you can have fun with this one.","November 29, 2013","true","51.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I've had a lot of trouble with this game, and as a matter of fact, it's starting to crash on me again. The vertical sync is a nightmare in this game, if you turn it off, the game runs like ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, if you turn it on, the game stutters like ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. If you own a 120/144hz monitor you'll fair better, but you'll have to mess with the max framerate in the console to get it working properly. As I mentioned before the game does crash from time to time. If you tab out, there is a good likelyhood the game will crash upon tabbing back in, and the only way to exit the crashed game is to sign out of your PC and sign back in.\n\nTL;DR\n\n-DO NOT buy this game if you hate optimization issues.\n-DO NOT buy this game for the multiplayer, there is none anymore, or at least nobody playing it.\n\n-DO buy this game for the zombies.

Only hints of lag are mystery box, but you shouldn't be looking at the box during the sequence.\n\nBut just think about it. All those mods you could play. All the themed maps with zombies. The endless variety. You may even be able to join a classic multiplayer match... with mods too.","June 15, 2015","true","21.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","3","4","3","0"

Why even bother killing someone when he immediately respawns after he is killed? No consequences when you are shot at, thanks to the health regeneration. The weapons feel weak and the multiplayer is atrocious. A pretty nice singleplayer experience with a believable setting but it unfortunately leaves us with a bad taste after a couple of hours. Want an interactive movie? Get this game. Want a good FPS game? Leave immediately.\n\nI might want to add: The coop campaign is ridiculously fun, this game and it's flaws are absolutely hilarious. I will recommend this game just for the coop mode.","November 28, 2015","true","7.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It had just been released a bit before I got my hands on it. I had gotten a Wii and a friend let me borrow the title. I was instantly hooked on the shooter and played the Call of Duty series every year it was released. Sadly the Wii version excluded the beloved Nazi Zombies gamemode. Modern Warfare Reflex came out on the Wii, a month after I got MWR it was Christmas and I recieved a PlayStation 3. Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 had just came out the month before. I also proceeded to buying World at War to finally get a taste of the game without using a gun with a remote attached to it.\n\nThe game itself is great. To revisit such a devastating time in history really gave me insight of how and why we goto war. The storyline of the game was great, and the multiplayer was fantastic. Zombies is literally the most addicting and fun gamemode I've played. It has so much to offer. Teamwork is key to survivng the levels and progressing. It gets harder and harder to take the zombies down and more keep coming. Treyarch did a great job with this game.","June 25, 2014","true","61.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not sure if it was because I was rushing to unlock zombies, or if it is just genuinely challenging. Playing as Dimitri is way more enjoyable than playing as Miller.

Now, after installing and having played about half the campaign I can't help but be baffled at howmuch better this game feels while playing. It's FPS immersion at its best in my opinion.\n\nNot to say I dont enjoy modern FPS games and their developments, but I went into playing this game thinking I was going to experience some mediocre storyline with Michael Bay inspired action movie characters + explosions. Well, the explosion part might still be true come to think of it. But other than that I absolutely love every aspect of this game. Nevermind the fact that it started the COD Zombie series which I've enjoyed across all of its installations.\n\nOverall, I'd say this game is an easy 8/10 based solely on the campaign.

In my opinion, it is the best COD game created, and Treyarch is the best company Activision has worked with. I can't find any fatal flaws in the game. If all you want is zombies and campaign, go right ahead and get this, but I can't find any lobbies that aren't full of hackers on the multiplayer. Also, this game doesn't really need 256 MB VRAM, as I can play the Zombies maps on 128. However, the campaign certainly needs it in some spots.\n\nPros:\n-ZOMBIES\n-Custom zombies\n-Nostalgia\n-Only 20 bucks\n-Relatively low system requirements\n\nCons:\n-Games are a little glitchy (E.g. instadown in zombies, not getting downed when you should in zombies)\n-Crashes when you try to change resolution and some other graphics settings (Just have to modify config file)\n-Hackers in multiplayer\n-Lose Jug when hit with Wunderwaffe (Minor complaint)\n\nNote that there are soooo many more pros, but those were the only cons I could think of at the time of posting this.","March 20, 2015","true","251.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

CoD 4 has great action, but WaW feels like a throw back to CoD 1,2 and 3. The gameplay can get stale and at times you get really bored if not with friends. Also, unlike the MW campaigns, I don't remember any one. No one was really as awesome as Soap or Price, but there was Reznov, who is badass, but not as much in this game then in Black Ops 1 and 2. 7/10 for gameplay\n\nMultiplayer- THE MULTIPLAYER IS ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ED AND FILLED WITH HAXERS. Well. you can get into a legit server, but usually someone is hosting the server, so there might be mods ahead. 6/10-for MP right now (2015), not in 2008-2010\n\nZombies- This, my friends, is the best part of this whole game. I love the zombies mode! It's because you can get custom maps and guns that are from other CoDs or just custom guns. Although, the 4 standard maps aren't bad, infact they are pretty good, they start to get boring, but with PPSH, nothing gets boring. If there was any reason to buy this game, then it's for zombies. 9/10-for Zombies\n\nIs it worth $20? Well, depends. Some people may have loved every thing about this game and don't care about hackers and modders in MP. If your one of those people than sure! Go ahead, but for poeple, like myself, that only want to play zombies mode with custom maps, it's not worth it. I would rather wait for a god damn season sale than pay $20 for this.\n\nFinal Score- 7.33/10\n","March 22, 2015","true","38.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Co-op is amazing it is something we should have in newer Call of Duty games. I couldn't forget this part, ZOMBIES. On PC you can get all map packs free and modding in zombies is bigger than ever.

The campaign is by far better than any other COD yet (up there with MW2), allowing you to play as two of the allied forces during WWII.\n\nWARNING: THIS GAME IS ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING HARD\nEven on normal difficulty, I'll die maybe 12 times in a mission. Not sure if it was because I was rushing to unlock zombies, or if it is just genuinely challenging. Playing as Dimitri is way more enjoyable than playing as Miller. Playing as Miller just felt like midlessly being attacked by and attacking Japanese and his missions never had any depth.\nPlaying as Dimitri is a GORGEOUS simulation of humiliation and vengeance, leading up to an insane climactic ending, mowing down nazis like a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing machine.\n\nPros:\n-Great campaign\n-Beautiful scenery\n-Nazi zombies\n-Great guns\n-Nazi zombies\n-Challenging\n-Best single player gameplay in any cod\n-Nazi zombies\n-Nazi zombies\n-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing nazi zombies\n-Did I mention nazi zombies?\n\nCons:\n-Only 4 Official zombie maps\n-Some screen tearing\n-No functioning Multiplayer zombie lobby's","March 24, 2015","true","203.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I  never buy Call Of Duty games since they've gone to a horrible loop of the same thing every year just with some new gimmicks such as in Advanced Warfare with exosuits. But prettymuch any and all Call Of Duty games made by treyarch are fun entertaining, and have a great replay value. I only buy Treyarch made Call Of Duty for zombies now and, I have never bought a Call Of Duty game for the multiplayer since generally it's not my type of gameplay but, unlike most other Call Of  Duty games multiplayer gameplay World At War's multiplayer is fun for me.

Sometimes, important AI (Roebuck, Reznov) just stand and do nothing at a checkpoint, and it sucks to have to restart an entire level because your AI friends just won't let you finish the mission. That being aside, it is a phenomenal story! I'd actually say it is about as good as CoD4's; CoD4 had more grueling and boring fights but a few more memorable cutscenes/missions. WaW's gunfights are more dynamic and brutal, but there aren't as many memorable cutscenes/missions; infantry and tanks just easily fall to your will, even on Veteran difficulty (the only hard part about Veteran is the grenade spam).\n\nMultiplayer is pretty much a copy-paste of CoD4. If you enjoyed playing CoD4 multiplayer, you'd probably think of WaW multiplayer as something like a WWII mod version of CoD4. It plays very well, but it lacks innovation, really.\n\nZombies is what it's all about and the only reason why I bought WaW on Steam when I already owned a copy for Xbox 360. The original 4 maps are quite fun, especially since you can access the developer console and annihilate zombies with infinite ammo, god mode, etc. But that's just the beginning. Mods!!! Downloaded custom maps from the internet are SO EXTREMELY FUN! You get to see what someone else has thought up for Zombies, and it's so refreshing because the last time Treyarch released a new map was August, 2013, which was a long while ago. I definitely recommend maps made from UGX, TMG, and ZCT, but there are still several indie maps that bring loads of innovation.\n\n*This is somewhat irrelevant to WaW, but I really hope Treyarch takes some Custom Zombies ideas for CoD 2015. Kino Der Toten was extremely uninnovative (copy-paste of Der Riese), and I was quite disappointed with the map when I first played BO Zombies. TranZit was a lot more innovative, but most of the new features were terrible trolls and not anything fun, really, so that left a sour taste on BO2 Zombies, too. Since AW is the newest CoD and is doing a terrible job with being a fun game to play, that makes it all the more important for Treyarch to revive the franchise.","January 26, 2015","true","313.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In my opinion, it is the best COD game created, and Treyarch is the best company Activision has worked with. I can't find any fatal flaws in the game. If all you want is zombies and campaign, go right ahead and get this, but I can't find any lobbies that aren't full of hackers on the multiplayer. Also, this game doesn't really need 256 MB VRAM, as I can play the Zombies maps on 128. However, the campaign certainly needs it in some spots.\n\nPros:\n-ZOMBIES\n-Custom zombies\n-Nostalgia\n-Only 20 bucks\n-Relatively low system requirements\n\nCons:\n-Games are a little glitchy (E.g. instadown in zombies, not getting downed when you should in zombies)\n-Crashes when you try to change resolution and some other graphics settings (Just have to modify config file)\n-Hackers in multiplayer\n-Lose Jug when hit with Wunderwaffe (Minor complaint)\n\nNote that there are soooo many more pros, but those were the only cons I could think of at the time of posting this.","March 20, 2015","true","251.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

CoD 4 has great action, but WaW feels like a throw back to CoD 1,2 and 3. The gameplay can get stale and at times you get really bored if not with friends. Also, unlike the MW campaigns, I don't remember any one. No one was really as awesome as Soap or Price, but there was Reznov, who is badass, but not as much in this game then in Black Ops 1 and 2. 7/10 for gameplay\n\nMultiplayer- THE MULTIPLAYER IS ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ED AND FILLED WITH HAXERS. Well. you can get into a legit server, but usually someone is hosting the server, so there might be mods ahead. 6/10-for MP right now (2015), not in 2008-2010\n\nZombies- This, my friends, is the best part of this whole game. I love the zombies mode! It's because you can get custom maps and guns that are from other CoDs or just custom guns. Although, the 4 standard maps aren't bad, infact they are pretty good, they start to get boring, but with PPSH, nothing gets boring. If there was any reason to buy this game, then it's for zombies. 9/10-for Zombies\n\nIs it worth $20? Well, depends. Some people may have loved every thing about this game and don't care about hackers and modders in MP. If your one of those people than sure! Go ahead, but for poeple, like myself, that only want to play zombies mode with custom maps, it's not worth it. I would rather wait for a god damn season sale than pay $20 for this.\n\nFinal Score- 7.33/10\n","March 22, 2015","true","38.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Nothing beats the gore of throwing a perfectly cooked grenade and seeing the limbs of your foes fly across your screen. The game holds a perfect upbeat rythm without making it feel to repetitive, which isn't pretty common nowadays. It is easy to be dragged into playing for hours and you never have a dull moment. The campaign is a highlight of the CoD series and I feel is always trying to be recreated in the recent titles. I used to play this game a lot on console when I was younger and I saw it fall to hackers when the new title was released and support was dropped, but I saw to my surprise that on PC there are many dedicated servers running hacker free games and they are full of players pretty much all day. The game hasn't aged at all, honestly we see games nowadays with worse graphics than this. It just goes to show that simple really is better. A timeless classic I think will stay alive for many years.","February 7, 2015","true","18.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Treyarch crushed anyone's dreams of a World At War II with the announcement of Black Ops III. I'm not complaining, either. Treyarch is my favorite Call Of Duty Developers, so I would have been happy either way. This game shows its age with a severe lack of basics such as achievements, modern multiplayer weapon unlock progression systems, and my personal biggest blow, no combat training. Aside from those small complaints, the game still looks pretty nice, the story is barebones but effective, the multiplayer isn't comepletely barron, and the custom zombies is the main reason for anyone buying this game in the first place. What's not to love about this timeless classic?","May 3, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With the series now being oversaturated with modern and futuristic warfare games populated by brown-haired burly white dudes that all look and sound the same, World at War has a rather diverse cast of characters who you feel like you can care about. After Treyarch finishes making Black Ops 16, they should really consider going back to the Allies v. Axis era.","May 3, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Multiplayer is also pretty good,but as any other CoD it's a bit annoying that there are everywhere annoying players (Pros with OP weapons,Dropshots,Shotgun-only players...) and you pretty much die after getting hit by 5 mp bullets,but i think that's cause moar realism,i mean: not everyone in WW2 had a bullet-proof vest like in modern times (black ops/2,mw2/mw3).\nSingleplayer rating: 9/10\nMultiplayer rating: 8/10\nComplete rating: 9/10","April 5, 2013","true","102.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

In my opinion, it is the best COD game created, and Treyarch is the best company Activision has worked with. I can't find any fatal flaws in the game. If all you want is zombies and campaign, go right ahead and get this, but I can't find any lobbies that aren't full of hackers on the multiplayer. Also, this game doesn't really need 256 MB VRAM, as I can play the Zombies maps on 128. However, the campaign certainly needs it in some spots.\n\nPros:\n-ZOMBIES\n-Custom zombies\n-Nostalgia\n-Only 20 bucks\n-Relatively low system requirements\n\nCons:\n-Games are a little glitchy (E.g. instadown in zombies, not getting downed when you should in zombies)\n-Crashes when you try to change resolution and some other graphics settings (Just have to modify config file)\n-Hackers in multiplayer\n-Lose Jug when hit with Wunderwaffe (Minor complaint)\n\nNote that there are soooo many more pros, but those were the only cons I could think of at the time of posting this.","March 20, 2015","true","251.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

CoD 4 has great action, but WaW feels like a throw back to CoD 1,2 and 3. The gameplay can get stale and at times you get really bored if not with friends. Also, unlike the MW campaigns, I don't remember any one. No one was really as awesome as Soap or Price, but there was Reznov, who is badass, but not as much in this game then in Black Ops 1 and 2. 7/10 for gameplay\n\nMultiplayer- THE MULTIPLAYER IS ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ED AND FILLED WITH HAXERS. Well. you can get into a legit server, but usually someone is hosting the server, so there might be mods ahead. 6/10-for MP right now (2015), not in 2008-2010\n\nZombies- This, my friends, is the best part of this whole game. I love the zombies mode! It's because you can get custom maps and guns that are from other CoDs or just custom guns. Although, the 4 standard maps aren't bad, infact they are pretty good, they start to get boring, but with PPSH, nothing gets boring. If there was any reason to buy this game, then it's for zombies. 9/10-for Zombies\n\nIs it worth $20? Well, depends. Some people may have loved every thing about this game and don't care about hackers and modders in MP. If your one of those people than sure! Go ahead, but for poeple, like myself, that only want to play zombies mode with custom maps, it's not worth it. I would rather wait for a god damn season sale than pay $20 for this.\n\nFinal Score- 7.33/10\n","March 22, 2015","true","38.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"
