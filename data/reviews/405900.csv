This got rid of FPS, black line, and other odd graphical issues. There are also varying degrees of success by turning on/off VSYNC and the new textures. Try it out.\n\nVideo for fixing these issues if you're having trouble finding them : https://youtu.be/hSIgtrwvFOY\n\nOverall: I've been playing the game for the last couple hours or so, and if you like Disgaea at all and want it on PC, then get this. I have found almost no issues with this port. I had to turn off SSAO and Field of Depth due to some weird graphical bugs, but outside of that.. the game is running at 60 FPS, the new textures look great, and it's as fun as ever. If you want a JRPG with some funny quips, mildly different strategy combat and good story, then this is for you.\n\nControls: Mouse and Keyboard work just fine, albeit a little wonky at times. Controller support is definitely here and works flawlessly. You can switch between the two at any time without switching options.\n\nGameplay: The core gameplay is just that of any Disgaea; filled with plenty of leveling, story, items, characters, laughs and more. It's a basic strategy/tactical JRPG with some added in features like colored tiles that change the tide of battle when stepped on.\n\nCurrent cons/negatives: There are quite a few graphical issues as well as performance issues. I was personally able to resolve these issues as detailed above. Outside of that, the keyboard and mouse combo can be a little off at times. Some textures might be a little low-res compared to others.\n\nCurrently playing, will update when more information is available","February 24","true","23.8"," 267 of 339 people (79%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","79","267","339","10","21"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imnotfeelingit/recommended/405900/","Imnotfeelingit","Calorie Mate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imnotfeelingit/","116 products in account","Disgaea is 13 years old by now, and I've played every version of it before. And if it's just about the game, then I wholeheartedly recommend it, but there's also the quality of the port to talk about, which unfortunately puts a huge dent into the port.\n\nIf you are intersted in SRPGs like Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem or Tactics Ogre, then Disgaea might be up your alley. In fact, I believe its one of the best franchises of the genre, especially due to its endgame.\n\nSince this is the first title in the franchise(PC version is based on the PSP port), it is a bit dated in comparison to it's succesors, but it still features all the core mechanics that make the series great. And some of them are really unique. They're already featured on the store page but some of the most noteworthy are those:\n\nItem world - The item world is probably the most unique feature of them all. A randomly generated dungeon inside every item, which you can use to level the item up or change how certain items work. There are two basic mechanics in the item world.\n\n1)For every floor you clear, the item gains a level. It gets tougher the further you go.\n\n2) Every item has residents that change the item's stats if you subdue them. For example, a "Marksman" raises the item's HIT stat, a "Gladiator" raises it's strength, and so on. You can even combine and transfer residents between items, so there's a lot to do here, if you want to create the perfect item/weapon.\n\nTransmigration - The max lvl in Disgaea is 9999, and on top of that you can use transmigration, which is basically a "rebirth" of the character. It's back to lvl1 but it'll be stronger when leveled up. And you're not limited to doing this only once per character...\n\nGeo Panels - GPs are colored areas in the field, which have different effects on characters standing on them(like 50% bonus exp.) You can change the effect or even remove the Geo Panel completely by picking up and throwing the crystal causing an effect to another place, or by destroying it. There's quite a lot to play around with here, so these are just the very basics.\nSo these are the three features I think are most important to mention. There's definitely more though(such as multiple endings and other unique gameplay mechanics.) The biggest draw for me though, is the over-the-top and comical story. This game does not take itself seriously.\n\nSo if you're into any of that, give it a go. Or maybe not, because there's also the port to talk about...\n\nThe Port\nTo make it short: this is the worst version of the game to date. A game which, for years now, can be emulated so incredibly well, that it runs at 300%-400% speed without any issues. Yet the port stuggles to run well on modern systems.\n\nProblems range from crashes, FPS slowdows, V-sync issues, and broken SSAO to port problems such as character stats being switched and wrongly labeled.\n\nSo why not a thumbs down? Because the problems are arbitrary and completely random. Some people report the game running fine with 60FPS on tablets and toasters, while others(such as me) struggle on modern hardware. No one can possibly say if you'll have problems or not, it's simply a gamble at this point.  So I chose to rate it as the game itself, and that's simply a game I'd like to recommend.\n\nEdit: They've put out a patch today(March 2nd), that fixed issues for some people, but didn't do anything for others, and also introduced more issues. So things stay pretty much the same.\n\nOther than that, the port doesn't feature any fancy settings. Just the options to switch between original and new textures, shadows, V-Sync, SSAO(broken) and a horrible Depth of Field effect. No resolution options either, just fullscreen or windowed. And that's pretty much it.\n\nIn the end, if you're interested in the game, give it a go. But please be prepared that, at this point, you may suffer from the arbitrary issues other people experience, because even though I wouldn't call this port a mess, it's still sloppy and runs/looks worse than the emulated PS2 & PSP versions of the game.","February 24","true","12.1"," 152 of 184 people (83%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","83","152","184","13","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IanStoianov/recommended/405900/","IanStoianov","IanStoianov","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IanStoianov/","569 products in account","Let's split this up:\nFirst, the game itself. It's a strategy RPG with a wild, sometimes self-referential plot, several jokes, references to movies and TV shows, led by a lovable cast of characters. Gameplay wise, the game's main feature is the possibility to take the characters all the way to level 9999(yes, four nines in a row), several over the top attacks, combo possibilities, and the geo-panel system, all adding to a highly replayable game.\nCombined with the "Item World", where you can go through randomized stages to strenghen your gear and even acquire some of the strongest in the game, and with the several endings and new game +, this will keep fans of JRPGs entertained for hundreds of hours. I had over 250 of those back in the PS2. Highly recommended.\n\nGranted, some mechanics are rather dated, but there's nothing obnoxious enough to disturb the enjoyment of the game.\n\nNow, the port. Look, it's a 13 year old game. The original was on the PS2, and this version is based on the PSP port. Personally, I expected the game to be a straight port and locked to 30fps, and I would have been fine with that for this game, but they added new surface textures, a new interface, and high quality character portraits. The character sprites themselves have not been touched, and offer the same pixelized style from back in the day, witth an optional "filter" that basically blurs the images(meh).\nOtherwise, the game has no real resolution options, but seems to run at your desktop resolution when in fullscrenn, and has a "Depth of Field" and "Background Blur", which to me, end up just bluring the top and the bottom of screen, and an option for SSAO, which at the very least makes the game jitery.\n\nUpon release, there were random performance issues, but the first patch seems to have fixed most of those. Avoid the needless SSAO option and it should run fine. I barely scratched the surface of what the game offers with this review, and can't recommend this game enough.","March 7","true","93.3"," 38 of 40 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","38","40","0","0"

In the past few years Steam has been practically bombarded with a plague of low-quality ports of classic JP games designed to cash in on nostalgia with very little effort. Disgaea's port was initially rough, but after a round of updates I have experienced no further crashes and very few graphical issues. Based on this, I can say that it's not just a simple cash grab, and that I would probably buy the sequel if it were released.","March 12","true","17.0"," 39 of 42 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","39","42","0","0"

Turns out the Steam review section have a letter cap and it can barely cover 1/4 of my review so I dumped it.\n\nDisregarding the optimization issues, the game itself is a must have for anyone who enjoys RPGs. The story isn't meant to be taken seriously, enter with an open mind and enjoy the vibrant characters the game has to offer.\n\nGive it some time though, the current optimization state is unjustifiable. You'd think that NISA, the publisher who also worked on the port, would spend more time on their dearest and longest-running franchise.\n\nAnd for people who's having frame rate issues, try turning off V-Sync, worked like a charm for me.\nIf it doesn't work, just keep tweaking with your settings.\nEdit: Delve into the forums and found out that if you have a controller, try plugging it in using InputMapper (Not sure if other alternatives works).\nI've been using my DS4 this whole time and running the game at 60 FPS with V-Sync off. When I plugged it off, the FPS dipped to a revolting 15 FPS. Tried it with my DS3 and got the same result, plugged in gave me 60 FPS and when removed, it dropped to 15 FPS again. Do not try it in game though, it will crash your game so make sure you save first.\nEdit 2: The horse ♥♥♥♥♥ is still a dangerous weapon.\n\nEdit3: They've fixed the issues and the game is playable now. NISA have been extremely responsive and active with the community and assuring us that the problems will be fixed and indeed it did. I've forgotten to leave that information in when I reviewed the game which was why I gave it a thumbs up.","February 25","true","127.2"," 61 of 84 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","61","84","4","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sardine_thief/recommended/405900/","sardine_thief","sardine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sardine_thief/","118 products in account","OH BOY WHERE TO BEGIN!\n\nDisgaea is my favourite game series of all time and after waiting literally 3 years later it finally made its debut to steam! Although it had a rocky start on launch day NIS did a good attempt to fix all the problems and although the game is playable for the most part, the rest of the problems can be fixed with the Prinny Perfect Mod that Kaldaien made so I strongly suggest using it if you want a better experience. Port issues aside, let's discuss about the meat that is Disgaea!\n\nThe best way to describe Disgaea is that it's Final Fantasy Tactic's crazy uncle who overdosed on drugs and alchohol. Compared to other tatic's games such as the aforementioned Final Fantasy Tatics, Fire Emblem  and X-Com, Disgaea gives you so much freedom and allows you to be as creative as you want to be! Literally every humanoid class can use any weapon skill with any strategy that opens up to many possible combinations (e.g. mage's with guns and archers with axes) and the absurd level cap of 9999. On top of that, the Item World, although archaic in the first game, is an excellent random dungeon if you want to spend time spelunking and improving your items!\n\nNow if you don't like grinding in videogames or can't tolerate an excess amount of grinding, I strongly suggest staying away from this game series as it is heavily grind based later on in the post-game/side-game, where the real meat of the game takes place.\n\nOut of all the entries in Disgaea, the main story in the first game is probably the best imho. With the original trio Laharl, Etna and Flonne, they make the story really enjoyable as it's mostly comedic and self-aware of it's own absurdness. Granted it does an excellent job when being serious as well so don't jump in thinking its all fun and games!\n\nVoice acting wise it can be a hit or miss for many people. I personally enjoyed the english dub of this game as they did a pretty good job in voicing the characters and I expecially love Barbra Goodson, Michelle Ruff and Sandy Fox for their roles as Laharl, Etna and Flonne respectively. They pretty much made the game for me and even to this day they still reprise their roles for the characters. And ik that Etna's original voice actor from the PS2 version didn't carry over and although I did like her old voice, I prefer Michelle Ruff voicing Etna since I'm more used to her voice than Amanda Winn Lee's. If you don't like hearing the dub there's the option to switch to japanese sub so it's up to personal preference.\n\nBtw, 90% of all the non-port problems that are in the first game have been fixed and improved on in Disgaea 2 and onward! This includes monster unit equality, faster level grinding and more challenging ordeals :) With that being said, I recommend playing Disgaea PC as it not only does a great job introducing you to the game's mechanics but also shows how the series has come far 13 years later.\n\nEdit 04/21/16: Completely forgot to talk about the music in Disgaea. Simply put, its GOD LIKE and I want everyone and anyone to listen to it. I give it a sardine/10 its too good m8.","March 15","true","81.8"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","32","36","4","0"

Here you can grind everything, which i mean as in everything. The item world offers limitless opportunity to explore your limit to the highest level even though sometimes the RNG god just wanna play with you and send some enemies to a separate island unreachable without the Hyperdrive.\n\n\nPros :\n1. After the latest patch, the game runs perfect on my potato. seems they have fixed the memory leak issue.\n2. Now i can do item world with no fear of sudden crash (i have completed a hyperdrive run /100 floors but under the beta release)\n3. Yeah, you could turn off the effects for both friendly and enemy (just imagine the time wasted seeing those summon animations in other srpg games) used when using special attacks, it really helps with grinding.\n\n\nCons :\n1. No  Plenair yet. tho you can get her and several other characters with Netherworld Content Pack by Khrisan Thyme in the discussion\n\n\nP.S.

I am in the "it runs fine" camp, so take that as you will. But a lot of people have found that unsubscribing from the Steam Beta has fixed their performance problems (for the most part anyways)....so there is that.\n\nDisgaea is a great SJRPG with memorable, amusing characters and fun gameplay. So if you like SRPGs/JRPGs, you will like this. HOWEVER, although the port of Disgaea is better than the Tales of Symphonia port, they have some issues they need to fix before I would suggest this to someone who is "takiing a chance" on it. Steam's refund policy makes this a little better now, but if you don't know what Disgaea is and / or don't already like it I would suggest holding off on buying this for a few weeks until they have nailed down the remaining issues. (which they say they are working on),\n\nSo, if you already love Disagea, and wanted a little PC action for it, go for it.\n\nIf you don't know what Disgaea is or have never played a Disgaea game, you may want to wait for another week or two before having a go at this.","February 26","true","1.0"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","0"

I cannot ever hope to properly convey to you how much of a wonderful thing this is unless you go from the ps2 to this port and see the difference yourself.\n\nThis is orders of magnitude more important than any other feature added to the pc port: abusing the game's grinding mechanisms often requires constant recycling of levels to the point where one might suffer the thought that the loading screen is where one spends most of the time in the console version.\n\nThis pc version does not suffer that at all with the added benefit of a large screen to experience the game with.\n\n#1 Frustration with the port\nThere are crashes; as they fix some issues with the game for others, they've been introducing new crashes for those with no problems. As far as I can tell, the majority of these crashes can, at the time of this writing on March 6th, be avoided by turning off all of the pc specific features, but many users have reported a memory leak that will randomly strike.\n\nThe devs have not abandoned us and have been steadily pumping out patches and interacting with us on the forums; I am not worried at all about the future of this title.\n\nWith this in mind, should you buy the port?\n\nAbsolutely. This is the definitive version of this game and any bugs that exist are steadily being addressed.\n\nIf you haven't played this game yet, you will likely be better served by other reviews which talk about core mechanics, but I should mention that you will find no better SRPG series available on pc (and, perhaps, beyond).\n\nbuy\n\nPort Report\nOriginal: 8/10\n\nPc Port:  6/10\n\n\nAddendum:I should add that Japanese Audio Support is available for those like myself who hate dubs of any kind regardless of language.

I love this game, despite it being, what? 15 years old? It delivers. If you're into this kind of RPG / strategy game, I would recommend giving this a go. Younger players might be a bit put off by the graphics and the "simple" gameplay, but if you can get past that, it's definitely worth it. The story is good fun and the voice acting is mostly good as well.\n\nThe "end game" content can be difficult, confusing and debatably boring. Grinding the Item World to level up your characters and weapons/armour can be a bore but it's worth it to access the extra content and getting access to all the additional humanoid characters can take a bit of research and cause confusion... but there is a sense of achievement as you progress and unlock more and more.\n\nThe game is a bit buggy and has a tendency to crash when (I, at least) chain a lot of special abilities over a long period of time. Usually around the end of the Item World I have noticed this will happen more often. I don't suggest alt-tabbing out of the game at all / much as that affects performance as well. Other than that, I have not experienced any issues.\n\nHopefully the newer Disgaea games also come to the PC as it would be a great boost to the otherwise Playstation-only franchise.","April 17","true","104.8"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","18","21","2","0"

Three is the first one I'v ever played and it was so much fun. When I heard Disgaea is coming to PC, I Immediately pre-ordered. Upon release, I had some FPS issues but they were all fixed with the most recent patch that hit. I'm excited for other Disgaea games coming to PC. They try hard to make the games better than the last and they're doing a great job.\n\nThe true "meat" of the game lies within the post game. The story mode is fun, don't get me wrong, once that's done you'll have a long ways to go until you actually can say you've completed the entire game. The max level cap in here is 9999. Yep. You can also venture through the item world to create the most powerful weapons and armor. The Dark Assembly is where you go to pass "bills" to unlock more things to keep you busy. Super strong bosses, and you can make enemies stronger about 18 times. So it's really something to do.\n\nThis is the first time I've played the first one, seems pretty bare if you've already played the later versions. No Item world pirates, No magichange, weapon profs are a thing, Can't attack or move with a huge tower of your characters. It's in the later games, so help support now so NIS/NISA can bring the other games to PC!\n\nMy only complaint with this game is that they named it "Disgaea PC".","March 3","true","88.4"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

My first impressions of the game were that the character designs and the animations were nothing short of amazing. The storyline was engaging, and full of hilarious and downright silly moments. The environments that you play throughout the stages were vast, ranging from snow covered mountaintops to the burning embers of volcanic ash to even a baseball field (yes, you read that right).\n\nIf you, like me, enjoyed Final Fantasy Tactics, you'll be pleased to know that Disgaea also boasts of myriad character classes for you to choose from - and customize as you see fit. (You can equip any class with any weapon/armor build, though most classes have a particular preferred set, but you're free to divert away from the latter if you so desire). Character classes comprise of the common warrior (very tanky) classes and mage (high damage, low def) classes to the more unorthodox classes (Scouts - able to change environmental bonuses, Angels - my personal favourite, excels in almost everything, and the completely imba Majin - demon(?) class behemoths than have virtually no weaknesses).\n\nAnd when you think you've leveled your characters high enough, the game also allows you to reset your character completely by a process called Transmigration that returns said character to level 1, with a modest boost to his/her base stats. The change pays off when you've transmigrated your character a couple of times and you'll begin to see the difference when your character grows from a struggling demon to a all-netherworld-will-fear-me demon (or human, or angel, or monster, or whatever-you-want-to-add-in-this-space) slayer.\n\nWhile many have commented about the technical bugs with the vanilla release, the recent update seems to have fixed many (if not all)  of the performance issues, and I've been running the game with a steady 60fps even during heavily animated scenes.\n\nAll in all, Disgaea is a gem of a game, and I'm glad that they did a wonderful job porting this to the PC after so many years.\n\nAlso, Disgaea was the game that, to my knowledge, first introduced the word "dood" and the world of prinnies. That, in my opinion, is worthy of a thumbs up. <3\n\nJust remember to get out of the house for a while. ;)","March 3","true","87.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

Most of the added graphical features should probably remain off, and the built in V-Sync slows things down painfully (and the game tears so badly with it off). But, if you turn those off, and play the game with a controller, it's perfectly playable thus far. I'll update if I run into any game-breaking glitches.\n\nIt's not the port anyone wanted, but it's playable, and the core game is wonderful, wonderful Disgaea.\n\nEdit #1: If for whatever reason the USB controller becomes unpluged, the game has no way to handle it and freezes. I didn't encounter this last night, but it's hit me twice today. You should be doing frequent saving anyway, but I can't tell you how frustrating it is to be about to deliver the final blow just to hear that windows "daDA" and everything stops.\n\nLong story short, as someone who missed out on the first Disgaea on PS2, I'm having a lot of fun with the game, but it is definately despite the problems with the port.

The only thing inferior about this game is the graphics.\n\nLeaves me shaking my fist wondering why, after all these years, aren't games deeper? Final Fantasty Tactics really looked good enough. Yet devs just produce the same amount of gameplay depth over and over, overhauling the graphics each time... and we keep paying for it. Because I support gameplay depth - truly beautiful games - I'm totally fine with the full $20 for such a rich tactical game that I've never played. I'm excited, I'm stoked, totally hyped, to finally be playing this game, even after finishing my second Xcom 2 playthrough less than seven days ago.\n\nMy friend from college hasn't even tried Xcom, because this killed tactical gaming for him. He said this game is going to eat my gaming time for months. I can see already - this won't be a short trip.","February 25","true","171.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I collect all the game from console and portable and the spinoff even Phantom Brave.\nI'll be doing a Technical Review instead of a Game review because the game itself is already awesome and I know PC people have always wanted this game since the beginning so I support them. I recommend this game for its gameplay and humor and for the 1st time it officially comes to PC breaking its exclusive Console.\nBut there is something SO WRONG with this Port!! I have to voice the technical issue!\n\nFirst off. The mouse cursor is annoying!! Sure Keyboard+Mouse is good but if I'm using a gamepad, the mouse cursor should disappear but instead it stays onscreen and messes up when you are trying to position your characters. I literally had to move the cursor offscreen. It just really messes up the game itself. Luckly there is an option to turn it off but the cursor will still stay in the screen. At least a turn off cursor button would be nice.\n\nAnother is 50/50 about the Graphics working and not working.\nAlso the options menu, is horrible. I think the SSAO or the Shadow is messing with the stutter clipping and such. There is so much fuzzy hazzy things going around. There are multiple people screenshotting their game with so many different problems.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=631898655\n\nThe screen end blur, normal map and Depth of Field needs to be disable. Like Literally.\nScreen end Blur, Normal Map and Depth of Field ends horrible.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=631922601\nScreen end Blur, Normal Map and Depth of Field disable. Now this looks much better.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=631922521\n\nNumerical Gamepad Controls. What?! How?! Even Mugen Souls and Tales and other JRPGs didn't do this. Cmon!!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=631909609\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=631923674\n\nFPS is between 30-60 depending on your Rig so its not FPS Lock. But there has been reports of terrible FPS drop even with those of Powerful Rigs.\nI'm using 2 different laptops which is a Low-Mid End VAIO S and Mid-High GE70 2PE Apache Pro MSI Laptop. There is bad FPS Dipping so they need to fix that Optimization Problem.\nNote: I always have V-Synv off even on NVIDIA Task Panal customization. I just hate it when that thing is on.\n\nFullscreen < Window mode\nSomehow, Window mode makes the gameplay much more smoother and faster while Fullscreen mode just slows things down... What is this? A Broken Emulator?\n\nThose with Inter-Graphics. The game will Default itself with Intel so you will have to open your Task Panel and force it to run into your Game Graphics Card. I don't know why but if you play the game and start having FPS dip this is the reason.","February 24","false","6.7"," 361 of 672 people (54%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","54","361","672","19","33"

Now that the ugliness of pre-patch Disgaea PC is behind us, I can comment on the game proper.\n\nDisgaea PC is a remake of the oldest entry in the Disgaea series: Disgaea 1. More specifically, it's a remaster of the PSP release, Afternoon of Darkness. The good news is that the new graphical editions are welcome ones: new backgrounds being the main draw. Sadly, some very simple additions that could have improved benefitial are lacking. Most glaringly, there's no in-cutscene "skip cutscene" button, which is a feature every Disgaea game from 2PSP onward had that made things much less frustrating. The game is also extremely slow compared to later entries, lacking the high-speed movement and camera options that later games possessed.\n\nAll-in-all, Disgaea PC's biggest shortcomings lay in the fact that it's a straight port for all practical purposes and doesn't include anything that would help make the game feel like it was released in 2016. Additions like more camera options, higher movement speed, a skip-cutscene button, and the improved "cancel options" system from later games could have helped bring this dated game into the modern era of Disgaea.\n\nAll that said, however, if you can get past the datedness of the game's mechanics, you've got a really solid SRPG on your hands here, and a new definitive starting point to the series. It's a wonderful title in a wonderful series, just be prepared to feel a bit irritated by the age of the experience. This is a faithful rerelease. For better and for worse.","March 7","true","12.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","3"

NISA now has a presence in their forum and have stickied some threads and tips for fixes. They have been active each day with updates. Turns out turning off Steam beta improved performance a ton for me, even on an intergrated chip. I am not going to delete my issues below until I've played a lot more however, but they may be gone now.\n\nNep needs pudding badly.\n\nI nep this nepping game, but the nepping port isn't as nepping good as it should be as of launch. They could learn from... well I don't want to sound biased.Seems like they learned from SE and NB, not IFI.\n\nI love this game franchise. And what I love about Disgaea, Laharl and team are now here on the PC. Music is great, the humor, the gameplay are all here. Being on the PC is good, but the only improvement is the new interface. I prefer the new sharp easier to read fonts over the old low res ones. However the fonts were not updated universally...so lots of low res text to be found.\n\nThe core game seems perfectly fine. The port is serviceable. However technically there are lots of quirks:***DANGER!!! Negative Nep Mode Enabled***\n\nV-sync is a joke. It will reduce movement speed and make it crazy sluggish, without even preventing screen tearing. Use your graphics card drivers to override the in game V-sync and turn off V-sync in game.\n\nCharacter filter is crap. It's a blurry terrible solution that never needed to be added. Just disable and look the retro sprites.\n\nNew Textures are hit and miss, overall a waste. In some cases the new textures have less detail than the originals. They do look sharp and modern, however sometimes they miss details the old assets had. Worn floor tiles that used to have broken bits and cracks become super smooth and new. In some cases the new textures have more details, such as added trims and decorative bits but they do seem a smidge out of place compared to the old character sprites. I prefer the old textures that match the character assets and original art direction.\n\nShadows, Screen Blur, DOF, SSAO, and Normal maps are a waste. Screen blur and DOF in particular seem like features that were never tested, they visually ruin the game. DOF can sometimes blur the entire screen...there is no depth, just a universal blur. Screen blur while more controlled, still clashes with the game visuals and was a pointless addition.  These features do not add to the game, they add to the bullet list of features to claim this is more than a port. Shameful at best.\n\nEven with Mouse disabled, mouse cursor is visible  Minor annoyance, but why add an option that doesn't work?\n\nNo resolution options Functionally, this works OK but seems strange. You can choose window, or fullscreen along with wide, full and windowed full screen, but not resolutions. For windowed mode you can drag the window to size it how you wish. It's OK, but abnormal.\n\nController configuration is minimal It works, but only identifies buttons via number. So A or X may be button 1, and you need to remember that Start is button 8, or was that 7? Pretty primitive if you ask me. PC gamers are smart so it won't be hard to recall which button 6 is on your controller. Don't nep me for saying this is one case I would prefer easy mode.\n\nLinework on the updated art is not refined As with many classic JRPG you see 2D character art during dialog sequences throughout the game. NISA updated the original art, but the linework is very thin and not very smooth. The artist did not have a steady hand, and it looks like a noob retouched the professional art from the original game. Even if it was an intern, it's unacceptable because it distracts from the original high standard that was set.\n\nGame is not optimized at all Sure I have a super computer with unlimited resources to run this game. But sometimes I play on budget rigs with integrated graphics chips. There is no reason this game can't go past 40fps when, I can get DOA5 to do 55-60 and that has lots of action and 3D models with boob physics... But even if I use my Nvidia GTX...I can't get past the Vysnc issues...\n\nV-sync again, confirmed Nepped... in a bad way Even if I get the game to run at 60fps, it will go back to 30 and get locked for a large assortment of reasons if I play in fullscreen. Fullscreen window seems to get past the problems. Menus, combat animations, going to shops, picking characters from the base will all revert(and lock) the fps back to 30, making the game move slowly and painfully. Alt tabbing, changing from window back to full will resolve this, but only temporary. My only current solution is to play fullscreen windowed.\n\nNISA doesn't seem to learn from Peers Truth is NISA doesn't even have any sticky threads in their own game forum. They posted an announcement requesting feedback but couldn't bother to post it on the Disgaea PC forum. They are really noobs and it shows. Other niche companies that westernize niche Japanese games have done a better job porting and supporting on Steam...\n\nDon't run the game with multi monitors for me at least, game is unplayable with multi monitor setup and fulscreen enabled. Works with multimonitor with windowed mode however.\n\nWhy recommend? Remember, there will always be a sale...and in the current state I suggest waiting for just that. While the game is still worth playing and the port is serviceable, it's not worth full price in it's current state. The game itself is still enjoyable once you disable all the improvements and find a way to keep the fps at 60.\n\nIf you don't mind playing in Windowed mode and disabling all the new improvements, this game is a ton of fun and well worth your time.","February 24","true","8.7"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","17","26","2","2"

When you play it the first time trough the story you dont will make without doing some older maps and level your character so a little grinding you need to do but in my opinion its not a bad think and when you get stuck you can whenever you want look in google for tipps becuase there are enough thinks about this game because its older.\nAnd at some maps you need to think how to beat it because of the Geo-Symbols who make some buffs or debuffs for the character that stays on the field like enemy buff or invincibility but more infos you get ingame.\n\nFor the game what comes after the story thats what is for me the real think i like to do then you start to grind your character to level 9999 and make your eq even better that you come to a million of damage and do more differend maps thats not from the story like the item world where you get random generated maps there is where you can spend easy more about 3000 hours if you want. When you now think thats boring because you dont like to grind for to long  then you can buy the game too for the story and a little playtime afterwards you will have your fun.\n\nI use my Xbox controller and i dont have any problems with it when you use your keyboard i dont know how this is.\n\nI hope my first review wasnt to bad and i hope some people will buy this game and like it that it will get some more people who like it so that the there will be alot more games from disgea in the future and more people enjoy this game for more question even for other disgaea games you can send me a message\n","February 28","true","46.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

While I have pumped over 100 hours into the game, but I'm coming to the point where I will need to be going into item world, and doing some serious grinding, and this is where the port falls to pieces.\n\neven though there have been several patches, they have fixed / broke / fixed / broke and not fixed some issues, the not fixed is the core crashing issue that still plagues this game. And to be clear, IF you just play the game for the story, not interested in doing long runs in the item world to get the best gear, or power level to highest level, then this game is worth it.\n\nBut if you want to collect stuff, power level, and play for long perios, then I would hold off getting this game, its not stable, (once you reach CoO and play the item world for long periods) then this game can't be recomended in its cuurrent state. As much I as enjoy playing it, the game is unstalbe, what is wrose, its down to the game code, how the game is bottlenecking stuff at a driver level, between the CPU and GPU, plus is using bad graphics handling that should never have been used to start with. and really bad resource mangagement. which pretty much sums up that this port has been poorly coded from the ground up.\n\nWe the community are at the mercy of the devs, and IF they decide to fix this mess, but from what Kaldaien has found out, I suspect the only way to fix this mess, is probably to do a rewrite of the code. and I'm not sure that will happen.\n\nbut if this is how NIS will release games onto steam, then sadly, I can see other games falling into the same mess as Disgea.\n\nAgain, I love this game, only found out about it when it came onto steam, its a great game, but saldy, this port isn't, and for that reason, I would stay clear of this mess until the devs fix it. If the devs do fix this, I will change this review, but I do feel people have a right to know about the quality of this so called port.\n\none last thing, because of the issues, I have two theories on them, either this game wasn't remotely tested in any degree at all, consdering it really doesn't take much effect to trigger this crash bug, plus I not mentioned the second crash bug, that is when you try and save the game, probably linked to the above, but it triggers if you not saved for a long period, so after a long spell in item world, the game might crash. so in all honesty, this bug should have surfaced for anyone who has played the game before release, and it should have been fixed before release. but this leads to my more concerning theory, NIS knew about the crashing and didn't bother to fix it, because of the time it would take too fix it.\n\nso which of those applies? I don't know, but I would say this, if this is how disgea gets treated on steam, shoddy coding and issues that should have been dealt with before release, will other games wind up the same fate?\n\nI guess we will have to wait and see, and hope that the devs will fix this mess.\n\nso if you want to endure crashing after so long, sure get the game, otherwise at this point in time, stay well clear of this shoddy port.","March 22","false","238.3"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

I had issues as well, but found a way around them. If you're willing to buy a game that may be unplayable at the moment, expect the worst, but hope for the best.\nFor those with AMD processors and having terrible frame rates (around 10fps), plug in a controller. You can still use the keyboard controls if you want, but having it plugged in allowed me to bring it back up to the 60 cap.\n\nI'll be honest. I'm not big on turn-based strategy games for my inability to learn information in a short period of time and how they can feel slow and repetitive.\n\nDisgaea, however, has really interesting mechanics which can change how you play on different maps and with different character setups. The customization has a surprising amount of depth in it; you can create custom characters to add to your party as well as buffing your equipment to fit their playstyle. The combat system gives you a variety of options to defeat your opponents, along with class- and character-specific techniques.\n\nIn essence, I thought I'd just play for a while and quit, but I'm really enjoying the freedom they give you.

Really glad they finally ported it to PC, the game works great for me and it's a ton of fun if you're into this genre. There are some small things that I would've appreciated, like hiding certain assets (trees etc. can block your view of characters), being able to skip faster than holding tab, being able to zoom further back and so on.\n\nThe only more substantial problem I've had with the game so far has been the Item World RNG. It's frustrating when you fight through 9 stages, and then the item boss spawns on an unreachable island (or even worse, you get stages that are practically or literally impossible to beat).\n\nThe good totally outweighs the bad though, most of my complaints are really just matters of convenience. It's worth every penny for the gameplay and entertaining dialogue, and I hope they port more Disgaea games in the future.","March 19","true","161.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Having the cursor NOT snap back to one of your characters, at the end of the enemy turn, is immensely frustrating and having to move it around the map (not a quick thing given some of the maps) looking for one of your party is just...could have been changed, should have been changed. And the ability to skip through the cut scenes would have been gratefully received by the people who played the original - the dialogue can be lengthy at times and I don't need to hear it all as I remembered the great majority of it anyway!\nGreat game with a few minor things that should have been tweaked, but they aren't game-killers by any means.

For now, I just wanted to point out a couple of things.\n\nFirst, I was VERY disappointed that Etna's voice is not the same as before. The original voice actress was perfect for the part, and this one is just playing second fiddle. It will definitely take some getting used to, and I hope it doesn't curb my enjoyment of the game entirely. It's hard to believe such a small detail can change the immersion so much, but it does.\n\nSecond, it's probably best to disable some options such as Screen End Blur, Depth of Field, and SSAO, as they honestly make the game look worse. Most of the other options are probably more of a preference thing, and even though it's not as "smooth" or pretty, I kind of prefer the old user interface and map textures. I'm having a hard time telling if the music is actually different or the same, but it sounds slightly off to me. Maybe I'm just remembering wrong, as it has been something like 10 years since I actually played Disgaea.\n\nAnyway, all in all, it is Disgaea, so I'm sure it's still a good game, and I'm not going to give it a negative review or anything unless I feel it deserves it after playing it. For the time being, this will remain as a placeholder of my initial thoughts until I dedicate some time to this old gem.","February 24","true","0.9"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","18","31","0","1"

It helps if you are into anime and such.\n\nFor fans its an must buy, for friends of Japans anime and / or rpg elements its definetly worth a try for a reasonable price.","February 27","true","146.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Now that I'm closing in on 100 hours of game play, it seems like a good time to drop a review.\n\nThe game is every bit as amazing as I remember it.  Being able to load in and out of stages with almost no loading time is freaking awesome.  The major glitches like game crashes have more or less been resolved at this point.\n\nPros:  Absolute grindfest!  You can spend as much time as you want making your characters and their gear over powered or you can try to squeek by with the bare minimum stats.  It's nice to be able to play the game at your own speed or just come back to a challenging stage later and pwn the crap out of it.\n\nCons: The first version capped Statisticians (the experience multiplier) at 300 per character.  Since you can't stack in slots or other items this can really bring the leveling process to a crawl.  Luckily the game was written with that in mind, so you don't technically need to hit level 9999 to beat anything.\n\nI love this whole genre.  I can't wait to see if Phantom Brave and Makai Kingdom make it to the PC.","April 1","true","101.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

I personally have played the first Disgaea on DS and the PSP so I knew what to expect. I also have palyed Disgaea 2,3, and 4 so I am no new person to the series. That being said, I gotta say this game is a lot harder then I remembered it from long ago and I am quite happy about it.\n\nAt first when this game came out, there were lots of bugs and problems. However, most of those problems did get fixed and honestly if it didn't get fixed, I would probably not have played it this much. I am glad that NIS America listened to our complants and did their best to make things better.\n\nThe game stands true to what I remember as, crazy damage, random dialogue and being able to make anything you want possible really. Mage with guns, Fighters using spells, Ninjas being impossible to hit, yet it is all possible.\n\nFor anyone new to the game I would say that I would recommend it but the difficulty curve is a bit high so grinding is needed. Well basically the whole game you grind to make your people stronger and go into items to make them stronger for your people to use. It is possible to get to level 9,999 but at the end of a standard playing you would get to without excessive grinding around level 100 or so. But post game, there is just so much to do that you feel like you are never done with the game.","March 14","true","69.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/flashn00b/recommended/405900/","flashn00b","Aya Shameimaru","http://steamcommunity.com/id/flashn00b/","304 products in account","Important notice: Reviewed on two machines, and I will try to update my review the further I progress through the game\nAlthough I'm not entirely a fan of how Nippon Ichi didn't choose this game to make their PC debut four years ago, I will do my best to put aside my personal dislike towards the developer. However, because the game does not appear to look updated at all moving on from Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness, I feel that it would be important to review its performance on the now archaic Acer Aspire 7552G-5488[www.cnet.com] to gauge its playability on low-end machines. (scroll to the bottom of the review for tl;dr)\n\n\nGraphics\n\nYes, I know that this is was originally on the PlayStation 2 and the PC version is based on the enhanced PSP re-release, and the reason i wanted to start my review with the graphics first is because at a first glance, one would think that you shouldn't need too much to run Disgaea. Having sat through the game's intro on my secondary machine, I have noticed that the game runs at a consistent 30FPS when rendering the 3D map despite the game's logic being tied to 60FPS.\n\nWhile one might argue that this is a turn-based strategy where FPS doesn't matter, Disgaea is known for having flashy and convoluted special attack animations, which you will need to turn off on low-end machines due to a lack of automatic frame skipping. I'm probably a little harsh about how low-spec Disgaea is when testing the game on a 5 year old laptop but please, feel free to argue that this is the more demanding game than this with a straight face, and I'm pretty sure i'm seeing some upscaling on the first screenshot.\n\nMoving onto my primary system, it would seem as if the game runs slightly better than on my laptop (36-41 FPS). Upon closer inspection, I have found out that somehow, the game only runs like crap when you don't have a controller plugged in. From what i've read on another review, the game seems to do a constant check on your CPU if you don't have one plugged in.\n\nOn the bright side, it's definitely an improvement from NIS' first PC game, the options menu has a decent amount of settings to tweak and the window can be freely resized (doesn't stop the game from upscaling), though one might nitpick about the lack of borderless mode.\n\nControls\nIn terms of keyboard and mouse support, the game is pretty barebones in this regard, since there aren't any dedicated camera controls outside of Q and E to rotate the camera and zooming in and out with the mouse wheel (only two zoom levels). In full-screen mode, you can't even move the cursor to the edges of the screen to move the camera. To move the camera with the mouse, you have to hover your mouse over the tile you want the camera to center itself on and hit any of the WASD keys. What I just said sounds pretty dumb and I know people are gonna say that i'm shooting myself in the foot for not using a controller, but my main gripe with Disgaea's controls is that it has no Xinput support. While this may sound like good news for those without an Xbox 360 controller, the game will treat your left analog stick as a D-pad, so no analog cursor movement like in the PS2/PSP and you can't use your actual D-pad as a D-pad.\n\nMoving back to how the game plays with the keyboard and mouse, the battle camera seems to be the only issue I have so far, as everything else seems to work just fine. Outside of combat, you can click on the map to move Laharl around or if he's standing next to an NPC, you can talk to them by left clicking them. In combat, the right mouse button serves as the △ (menu) button when hovering over an empty tile and ○ (cancel) in menus or when hovering the cursor over a tile occupied by one of your characters. the left mouse button is used as the ✕ button and for some reason, is also used to move the camera around. Alternatively, you can also use the I key (not Esc, since that is multi-bound like the right mouse button) to access the menu. While UI is geared towards console play, you can at least access all of the menu options with just the mouse.\n\nIn my honest opinion, I feel as if both the controller and kb/m could've been handled a lot better, the latter moreso.\n\nGameplay\nFull disclosure, I have not played the PSP version in a very long time, so this will probably be the worst part for me to explain.\n\nTo the unfamiliar, one would first think that it's just a clone of Final Fantasy Tactics. Perhaps one would not be incorrect to say it has drawn inspiration from it, though it does have its fair share of unique mechanics and arguably a larger class diversity. In addition, there are a few mechanics that are common throughout the entirety of Disgaea; the first one being team attacks, where if you have allies adjacent to a character initializing a basic melee attack, they will join in on a gangbeating. The best part is, said gangbeating only uses up the action of whoever was given the attack order.\n\nAnother mechanic is the Lift and Throw system. You can literally tell one of your guys to lift someone else over their head(friend or foe) and depending on their class (monsters can't throw), toss them a certain number of tiles. In most cases, it will look as if you can only throw at 4 directions, though if your timing is really good, you can also throw diagonally.\n\nAnother mechanic unique to the franchise is are the Geo Blocks, which give passive effects on colored tiles. In addition to this, you can also destroy these blocks to change colors of a certain tile (assuming the geo block isn't the same color as the tile it's on), which can be used to deal damage to multiple enemies at once, though in the early game, you’ll probably want to preserve geo blocks that are beneficial to you.\n\nOverall, I feel that the combination of all these give for an enjoyable deviation from Final Fantasy Tactics' format, even if hindered by the game's less than optimal controls on both the mouse and the controller. As for the $20 price tag, I think I would've waited for the Steam Summer Sale before buying this game, since the controls and performance issues I had with this game prevent this from being worth $20, and I'd also like to think that the issues I have now would be fixed between now and said sale. However, since I already burned a fair amount of money on 3 copies of Cladun X2*, it would’ve been wrong to not pre-order at this point. Ultimately, I’m gonna give the game a thumbs up since I think it’d be better to buy the game on a sale than to not buy it at all because it’s still a pretty good game.\n\nAnd yes, I know I forgot to cover things like the dark assembly and item world, though most of my play time has been spent analyzing the porting quality. I will (hopefully) cover the more advanced aspects of the game the further I play through it.\n\ntl;dr\n+Geo Blocks, team attacks, class diversity and the lift/throw system add to a fun take on the turn-based strategy RPG format\n-Pretty unoptimized, especially when you consider that there are other options available for low-spec games.\n-Keyboard and mouse controls are barebones and no Xinput support\n±Game's only worth $10-15 IMHO, but it's better to wait for a sale than to not buy at all.\n\n*Before you ask, all three copies have been redeemed.","February 25","true","5.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","6"

Recommended.\n------------------------\nAs always, my recommendation comes with a disclaimer that your experiences will vary. Please read through at least the next paragraph.\n\nLet's tackle everyone's main issue with this port... performance. Good God, launch day was a disaster for a lot of players, even those with high-spec PCs. But, interestingly enough, I have a mid-tier rig running 2.5-year-old hardware (i5-4460 3.2GHz + R7 260X 2GB), and Disgaea PC works fine. I'm honestly not sure where everyone's frame drops are coming from. I tested using new/old map textures, SSAO (which I didn't like personally, but it still didn't impact my performance too much), and all the other minor graphical tweaks...no sudden drop in FPS for me. So I'm probably really lucky that it runs perfectly fine... and as such I'm going to ignore factoring in performance for my review. Just be warned that if the game doesn't run smoothly for you, the rest of this review is pointless and you should return this game until NISA (Nippon Ichi Software, America) sorts things out. NISA seems to be on point and fixing a lot of the issues with the game's performance currently, as Disgaea PC's rating has increased from 67% (Mixed) to 85% (Very Positive) after the first few weeks of bug fixes.\n\nDisgaea PC is a port of Afternoon of Darkness on the PSP, which is an enhanced remake of the original PS2 title, Hour of Darkness. This is the third remake of Hour of Darkness, after Afternoon of Darkness and Disgaea DS for Nintendo DS systems.\n\nDisgaea (the series) is a tactical RPG (grid-based, turn-based, action points, the usual deal) with its key selling point being the ability to grind out your stats and level to absurd highs. The caps for stats and level are insanely high (~20 million for each stat in Disgaea PC and 9999 for level). There's a lot of bonus maps, content, and endings to access that the game acknowledges how many New Game Pluses you've done. I love grindy games, and so I figured Disgaea was right up my alley. Sure enough, I've played and enjoyed the hell out of Hour of Darkness and Cursed Memories. Haven't played 3, 4, D2, or 5 yet since I don't own a PS3/4.\n\nAnother highlight of the Disgaea franchise is the Item World, a completely randomized dungeon crawl generated from items you collect in the game. By exploring the Item World, you can grab more items, grind out EXP, and improve that item's stats. Each item contains an expansive dungeon of 30, 60, or 100 floors, depending on the item's rarity.\n\nI'd have to argue a minor problem with the mechanics is just how many different systems they've jammed into this game. There's the tactical combat, which is simple enough to understand... then they introduce Geo Panels and Effects, Lifting and Throwing allies, enemies, and Geo Effects...the Dark Assembly, Pupils, Skill/Stat Inheritance between Master and Pupil, the Item World, Reincarnation (Transmigration in this version), and some mechanics the game doesn't even cover such as Elemental Affinities (Fire, Wind, Ice), Status Effects, and Weapon Masteries. For a newcomer this may seem like a daunting amount of things to learn about... and believe me, it is. However, all of these things don't need to be used...in fact the game even tells you, you can beat the game with "minimal game knowledge". The systems are there to provide hardcore players the means to be more efficient in grinding out those stats.\n\nI won't go into nor analyze the story (because I suck at analysis and not spoiling), but I will say it's decent and humorous enough to suffice as an RPG plot. I also will not criticize the graphics because I don't really care for them, but the port made the map and character art look better than the PS2 graphics. There is also an option to change the graphics back to the old PS2 game, for that old nostalgic feel (I guess). EDIT: I completely forgot about the Keyboard+Mouse (the mouse kinda messed the cursor movement up for me, so I turned it off...but you could technically play the game using just the mouse if you wanted to... also mouse click detection is a bit bugged) and Gamepad support (which is a little clunky to detect). That's there as well. I suppose I should also add that the port added custom resolution support. (you can resize the screen to your desire)\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a solid 8/10. Good for RPG fans, grind-fest lovers, and people who just want a lot of content for their buck.\n\nScore Breakdown:\nStory/Plot/Characters: 9/10\n(each character seems unique in their own way, dialogue gave me a couple laughs, story was dramatic at times - but not overly so when it was)\nMusic: 8/10\n(pretty good soundtrack, still waiting for my digital dood/pre-order soundtrack bonus)\nGraphics/Art: 5/10\n(has a nice theme to it, but even with the new textures the game looks dated, plus the new character filter thing just blurs the pixels so your characters look like a smudge on the screen... wtf?)\nMechanics: 9/10\n(lots of cheesing you can do with unit movement, lifting, and AoE attacks, maybe intentional, but overall great mechanics\nValue: 10/10\n(hours and hours and hours and hours of content and grind)\nPerformance: 8/10\n(works fine on my rig - stays notably above 60fps most of the time - others not so much... EDIT: I am now getting crashes more often, and I'm not sure why. Maybe the math and numbers are getting too high? Either way, dropping 2 points off performance. It shouldn't be crashing because of memory leaks or integer over/underflow.)\n\nOh yeah, I should add: Buy it for the Prinnies, dood!","February 28","true","94.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You know what that is, right?  It's why you're here.  So what you want to know is:\n\nHow is the port?\n\nThe answer: It depends.\n\nThere have been many reports of people attempting to run it and have it lock up, play sluggishly, or have graphical tearing.  I am not one of these reports.  My computer is old, my graphics card is out of date (AMD says it's a "legacy" product now, yay!  no more support!), and by all rights, if there are going to be optimization issues, I should be feeling them.\n\nBut here's the thing: I'm not.\n\nI get smooth FPS, the updated UI looks good, configuring my old GamePad Pro was a breeze (plug it in, switch two buttons on the Config screen, and I'm done), and I have had absolutely no issues at all.  The closest thing to a CON I can think of is that the mouse cursor stays visible even with MOUSE: OFF.\n\nSo TL; DR - if you like Disgaea, get this.  Why are you even thinking about it?  If you have a computer that has issues with the port, you have 2 gameplay hours to request a refund.

In short, original with the extras (side game content).\nGet your levelling progress satisfaction of the day here.\n\nStory part (will be subject to changes in near future) (I have been tossing the story for the side game content that can be played any point in the story).\n\nDemons are people, too.\nIt's story is silly and zany that will bluntly and subtly deliver deeper message.  I am going to say that it is a story can be hit or miss only because the only time I experienced it when I was 14 and liked it.\nThe plot plays with tropes and surface layer of jRPGs. With very surface skimming:\nThe main character, Laharl (the son of the late Overlord of the netherlord, King Krichevskoy) has to remind the contest for the throne that he is the heir to the throne, fend off the forces of [science fiction] human attackers, and infiltrate the Divine hosts of Celestia. That Heaven, Hell, and Earth at war idea.\nI liked the idea of the deconstruction of the after-life as JudeoChristianity with Reincarnation through the means of the Prinny, dood.\n\nGameplay\nTile turn based.\nIn-game the player is told that the game [normal story] can be completed with minimal knowledge.  This is great if you are more into casual or story mode games.\nI would like to assert that the side game may require more knowledge on the matter, however. This will come naturally to hardcorers.\nHighly customizeable characters for stats that the player wants. The player can create characters to use in combat other than the unique characters.  Weapons are the only thing that show when equipt to a character (except monster characters).\nMax Level 9999 and reincarnations to level 1 for much high base stats.\nDamage multipliers to reach well beyond 100 thousand.\n\nEnemies too easy? Murder senators that deny you a Stronger Enemies bill in the Dark assembly.\n\nBeing a game with a lot of menus, its pretty fluid.\n\nGraphics/Music\nSprites with 3d environment.\nPS2-esque with optional/free new texture.\nThe way the developers used their insturments with the special attacks may wow you.\nIts music is unique to me or stands out enough to me for me to enjoy the remastered soundtrack.\n\nAchievements\nFair and difficult.\nStory progression achievements (I want to say there is one for all alternate endings, but I cannot comfirm that at the time.)\nDamage done in one hit achievements\nBounty slaying achievements\nGrinding Incentives\n\nPlayer support\nNot a port'n'dump\nThis isn't really about the game, but the program itself that needs to be said.\nFirst of all, in its current state it still crashes seemingly randomly on high end computers.\nWhen this game was first ported and released on PC, the game had issues. Some people couldn't get it to run, some high-end computers had fps issues, and some people had no issue whatsoever.  The company that released this diamond in the rough has been with the players, hearing their complaints on these issues, and have been working on those issues.  I am posting this review after the big issues.  I run on 60 fps usual with occassional fps drops and rare crashes.\nSeeing this get be fixed up fills me with joy to have found a video game company that respects their consumer.\n\n\nEdit log:\n1.\nMy story mode edit will take a while longer. I just got my yo-shi-tsu-na and my savefile was lost due to steam cloud transfer overwriting the wrong save over it.\n2. Built back up and got the Hyperdrive. Game crashed while game was processing item's stats. Probably will say "forget it" to trying to get that again for a while.  Other than that, I was pretty surprised that the game hasn't crashed in between.","March 25","true","219.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The character textures were not updated but a filter was added to smooth them which in my opinion makes it look worse. However, you have the option to turn that off. The UI has been redone and also has the option to use the classic version of that but considering how well done the new one is I think that is better. The animations during cut scenes are crisp and clear also.\n\nAs far as the actual game goes it has a quirky ridiculous story but that is not its main attraction. The main attraction is the fact that everything can level up in this game. You can literally take a basic HP pot that restores 100 health and level it up so it restores 10,000. It is the same for every item in the game including weapons and armor. Your characters can level up to 9999 and there is loads of content for people who make it to that high of a level. You can transmigrate your characters back down to level 1 and level them up all over again. It all seems like a bit much but once you get to that level it actually goes really fast the second time around.","February 24","true","116.6"," 26 of 49 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","26","49","2","1"

The dev team is continuing to work on patches and improving player experience with each patch, as of today pretty much all of the negative reviews are irrelevant.\nGame itself has been improved form previous versions offering new textures, filters, and the pretty UI from newer games, recommended to fans of the series and people who enjoy SRPGs. As a real fan of the series I'm glad to be able to support this project and see it improve, hopefully we can receive more games of the series on the PC in the future.\n\nFor newcomers and curious people, disgaea is a japanese SRPG featuring a colorful cast of likeable and unique characters, a ton of different classes/units to create to customize your party, a lot of over-the-top skills, the ability to reach incredible levels and damage numbers.\nYou can rebirth your units to go back to level one, keeping most of your stats and skills while getting stronger and advancing to a new tier, you can also attempt randomly-generated dungeons within each ITEM to level it up and increase its stats further, there's a lot of fun grind to do and things to find, obviously optional.\nEven 13 years later, Disgaea 1 is still a joy to play and I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys or has enjoyed the genre, and to people who are interested in getting into the genre.","March 16","true","24.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"questionable" if you are expecting a straight PC game. The Japanese are not known for "good software development practices" to put it very kindly, so that the US team can get it working this well, with working mouse is truly amazing.\n\nHaving said that, the mouse support isn't perfect, sometimes it will not register a click (usually on the starting tile) and you will have to press a "joystick button" (which could be bound to the keyboard) to get your characters.\n\nThey've managed to improve the graphics slightly, bravo, I'm quite impressed. It alt-tab's more or less correctly.

However, I consider it a minor problem, which will be fixed someday soon.\n\nDisgaea: Hour of Darkness is one of my favourite games of all time. It has funny dialogues, engaging story, vivid characters and great design, but it is not a compensation for the poor gameplay - on the contrary, gameplay of Disgaea is pretty complex and it gives you a lot of freedom to create your own way to play. This freedom and customizability of gameplay is something that can rarely be seen in Japanese TRPG's (and not only them), so Disgaea is somewhat unique. You can make yourself an army of different demonic underlings, or use main characters, you can use classic weapons for each class, or you can give a handgun to your barbarian - it's up to you. Grinding to LV9999 is not just a simple hack'n'slash through the enemies over and over again (it is possible, though) - it is a quest to find an effective way to maximize your characters to the top. Make your enemies stronger, upgrade your weapons (by beating it from the inside, lol), transmigrate and become super strong. It is not a mandatory task, though - you can just beat campaign stages without any addition grinding at all, but you will have to use your head to be effective in battle and solve different puzzles in a process. Throwing and color_panels mechanics make this game even deeper, so prepare to think a lot.\n\nSo, imo Disgaea is a great game and if you haven't played it - you most definitely should. As I said earlier, PC port is experiencing some technical issues in the day of release (for example, I can't see proper animations, have some problems with layers and there is no visible Base Panel at the start of the level, just an empty spot on a map, which I need to remember), so it would be wise to wait for developers to correct all these issues (and I guess that it will be done soon enough), and then to buy this wonderful game.\n\nFor those who already bought it and trying to make the game work/trying to refund - just wait for a bit. No game is perfect on a release day. A lot of people mentioned it, but if you turn off all these fancy options, such as SSAO, V-Sync, Depth Field, Character Filter, etc, you may solve your problems. Somebody even solved them by pluggin in their gamepad - so if you have one, try to use it (Disgaea, being a console game, should be played with a gamepad, after all).\n\nLet us be patient and trust Nippon Ichi - I am sure that they will fix stuff and we will have our Disgaea on PC. And when that happens, I wil rewrite this review, dood.","February 24","true","6.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Simple changing of the graphics settings helps to remedy most things.  It still looks a bit fuzzed over when I play.\n\nThey do need to have a setting to increase the speed of battles.

So speeding things up should not be an issue.\n\nBut even with these issues, the overhauled UI looks clean and crisp and the game plays like it did.

Character sprites don't really seem any different, not that there was really anything wrong with them, but there is a blur option to smooth them out a bit.\n\nI can't say anything about the voices since the version I played originally was Disgaea DS, so I didn't get any voices.\n\nKeyboard controls are pretty functional, and the mouse works fairly well in the Overlord's Castle. It's also fairly nice in the field (There's two controls that aren't immediately obvious with the mouse. You can hold left click and move the map around some. You can also hold right, move the mouse in a direction, and then release right click to spin the map. It's a bit awkward of an implementation, but otherwise the map would spin as though the Netherworld was on tornado watch.)\nUsing the mouse in the field feels a bit twitchy though, it'll easily decide to go out of bounds rather than stay on the map itself.\n\nAlso, oddly enough, they added a new feature that I don't think they mentioned.\nIn the Dark Assembly, you can now rename any and all of the NPCs in the Overlord's Castle. It's a bit odd of a feature for them to add, but it's there and it's neat.\nI don't think that's in any other Disgaea game. It wasn't in the original, I don't think it was in 2 (Didn't play it.), wasn't in 3, wasn't in 4, wasn't even in D2, and I've never played 5.\nIt might've been in one of the ports, I don't know for sure. I didn't get the chance to play them.\n\nRecommending mostly because it's 20$, and it's Disgaea. If you're a fan of SRPGs, then you really can't go wrong with Disgaea.\n\nHope someone figures out modding. That'll be fun to play around with.","February 24","true","5.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Now, I've seen reviews where people were displeased with the Frame rate of the game and possibly other technical issues but I haven't really had any issues with the game myself and my computer IS NOT top of the line by any means. The only slight issue that i've noticed is the player movements are slightly slower that the PS2 version but its my no means a game breaker or should detour someone from trying this game out themselves.\n\nDisgaea is a amazing turn base game that always entertains with its cast of characters and its insane humor. I would recommmend this to anyone to give it a try. There is always Steam's 2 hr refund policy if your not happy with the game and 2 hrs is more than enough time to play through several of the missions to experience the game yourself.

Disgaea is one of the most freeform games ever. Distribute 10 actions over a turn freely, from 10 separate turns in a row to a Rube Goldenberg-esque chain attack that devastates your target(s). Level up your characters with traditional grinding, or tweak your items with random-dungeon crawling to make them twice as powerful as normally or more. Are the plot-based characters too boring? Create your own! Do you think archers would be cooler if they ran around with axes and longswords? Why, just give them some!\n\nDisgaea doesn't just have a single way to play it - you can do anything you want, and still succeed (well, as long as you did something remotely sensible), and that's why I love it. It also is extremely rich in content - you can easily lose hours in the random dungeons, and getting to the normal final boss doesn't even show you half the stuff you can come across. There are several bonus stages to take on once you're done with the normal story, and the story's final boss' level of 105 pales in comparison to the ultimate secret boss Baal's towering Lv.4000 figure - not to mention there's no end to the power of the random dungeon enemies' and bosses' strengths. Between powering up your party, micro-managing your equipment, and taking on new bonus challenges, you'll easily lose a few hundred of hours in this game, and feel entertained and rewarded all the way through. Slow-paced enough that you can watch videos and eat while playing, fast-paced enough to never get boring.","May 23","true","76.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Seriously why thumbs up a game simply based on the franchise alone? that's like thumbing up Dragon Age 2.....simply because it's the 2nd Dragon age agme and DAO was amazing.\n\nThose looking for a genuine review with harsh truths please look here.\n\nNOTICE! Yes this is Disgaea in all of it's glory yes i love the franchise i've owned every game to date excluding the DS port because...well...didn't have a DS at the time lol But i'm a die hard fan of the franchise and was soooo excited when i saw this listed that for the first time in at least 5 years since SKYRIM i pre-ordered a game.\n\nNOW THAT THATS OUT OF THE WAY.\n\nThis game has a TON of issues\n\nGraphical issues come down to 3 major and i do mean major problems\nSSAO as people have pointed out breaks the visuals entirely with graphical glitches like messed up black lines all over the place. Turnning this off in turn removes the graphical glitches but SSAO should NEVER be the cause of such a thing and thus needs dire fixes.\nResolution: this is probably the biggest one because it's tied to a bunch of problems. For starters, trying to run this game in full screen (there is no borderless? why?) completely breaks the game entirely. Upon going into full screen (for me) the game minimized......and refused to come back up......when ever i tried to maximize the window again it would just go right back down after a few seconds and the ONLY way i got it to stay up long enough to go back into windowed mode was to rapidly spam click my mouse on the window as it came up. it was extremely frustrating and this was all with in the first few seconds of loading the game up for the first time NOT EVEN IN GAME YET TECHNICALLY.\nnow back to the resolution issue. This port is clearly a port from the PSP or DS version of the game because OH GOD the graphics are soooo blurry. Turning off every graphical enhancement makes it look worse like it's running sub 480p and resizing the window just makes it even more stretchy and blurry. Character filter is absolutely pointless beause regardless of it being on or off the characters are pixelated to no end. Seriously they NEED to update the sprites for this game to play it on PC.\nthe third graphical issue is more on a performance side of things. the menus take FOREVER to bring up and the scrolling text for things like tutorials and talking to NPCs in general do not have a speed adjuster. You can not alter this so if you accidentally talk to that one NPC that just won't stop talking....guess what? .....tough luck....you're stuck spamming your buttons away until the text goes away. PATCH IN SCROLLING TEXT SPEED OPTIONS PLEASE!\n\nNow onto the rest of the....issues....\ncontrols. if you have a regular controller you are set, it's fairly easy to figure out the game with that. If you're on a mouse and keyboard like myself, yes you have rebindable keys, BUT THE BUTTON PROMPTS ON SCREEN DO NOT MATCH YOUR KEYBOARD HOTKEYS. To skip tutorial story stuff when selecting a map it says 4? i pressed 4....nothing happened......what does this 4 mean? OH it means the 4th button for your CONTROLLER. Good job! SO IT DOESN'T REFLECT WHAT KIND OF CONTROLS IM USING. On the flip side this is just a minor inconvenience as the menus and game as a whole can be completely played and controlled via mouse. Your keyboard doesn't even need to be touched as a matter of fact. the menus are accessed via left click over a character and right click over an open space to bring up the regular main menus for ending your turn or swapping out equipment and checking on character stats. But as i pointed out, the menus and controls as a whole are just sooo off in terms of responsiveness. you can click twice on the screen and nothing happens when trying to pull up the main menu. it's very frustrating when the game itself runs at a perfect 60FPS for me. This is the first time a Jrpg of any kind has run so smoothly in terms of framerate on PC for me since most Japanese game developers don't put much effort into optimization in general for PC.

I did follow some of the advice posted in other reviews about modifying the graphical settings so that very well may have helped.\n\nFor the game itself, so far I'd give it a 10/10.  Personally, unless I played an old school rpg/jrpg in the past I can't get into it.  Disgaea has pulled me in.  Everything about it is very appealing to me, the variety of monsters/allies you can create, the dark assembly, being able to clear levels inside of items to make them stronger, etc.  It's a lot of grind but I have a feeling I'm going to play it for a long time.\n\nI hope we get to see more disgaea games on steam!","February 28","true","28.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Seriously why thumbs up a game simply based on the franchise alone? that's like thumbing up Dragon Age 2.....simply because it's the 2nd Dragon age agme and DAO was amazing.\n\nThose looking for a genuine review with harsh truths please look here.\n\nNOTICE! Yes this is Disgaea in all of it's glory yes i love the franchise i've owned every game to date excluding the DS port because...well...didn't have a DS at the time lol But i'm a die hard fan of the franchise and was soooo excited when i saw this listed that for the first time in at least 5 years since SKYRIM i pre-ordered a game.\n\nNOW THAT THATS OUT OF THE WAY.\n\nThis game has a TON of issues\n\nGraphical issues come down to 3 major and i do mean major problems\nSSAO as people have pointed out breaks the visuals entirely with graphical glitches like messed up black lines all over the place. Turnning this off in turn removes the graphical glitches but SSAO should NEVER be the cause of such a thing and thus needs dire fixes.\nResolution: this is probably the biggest one because it's tied to a bunch of problems. For starters, trying to run this game in full screen (there is no borderless? why?) completely breaks the game entirely. Upon going into full screen (for me) the game minimized......and refused to come back up......when ever i tried to maximize the window again it would just go right back down after a few seconds and the ONLY way i got it to stay up long enough to go back into windowed mode was to rapidly spam click my mouse on the window as it came up. it was extremely frustrating and this was all with in the first few seconds of loading the game up for the first time NOT EVEN IN GAME YET TECHNICALLY.\nnow back to the resolution issue. This port is clearly a port from the PSP or DS version of the game because OH GOD the graphics are soooo blurry. Turning off every graphical enhancement makes it look worse like it's running sub 480p and resizing the window just makes it even more stretchy and blurry. Character filter is absolutely pointless beause regardless of it being on or off the characters are pixelated to no end. Seriously they NEED to update the sprites for this game to play it on PC.\nthe third graphical issue is more on a performance side of things. the menus take FOREVER to bring up and the scrolling text for things like tutorials and talking to NPCs in general do not have a speed adjuster. You can not alter this so if you accidentally talk to that one NPC that just won't stop talking....guess what? .....tough luck....you're stuck spamming your buttons away until the text goes away. PATCH IN SCROLLING TEXT SPEED OPTIONS PLEASE!\n\nNow onto the rest of the....issues....\ncontrols. if you have a regular controller you are set, it's fairly easy to figure out the game with that. If you're on a mouse and keyboard like myself, yes you have rebindable keys, BUT THE BUTTON PROMPTS ON SCREEN DO NOT MATCH YOUR KEYBOARD HOTKEYS. To skip tutorial story stuff when selecting a map it says 4? i pressed 4....nothing happened......what does this 4 mean? OH it means the 4th button for your CONTROLLER. Good job! SO IT DOESN'T REFLECT WHAT KIND OF CONTROLS IM USING. On the flip side this is just a minor inconvenience as the menus and game as a whole can be completely played and controlled via mouse. Your keyboard doesn't even need to be touched as a matter of fact. the menus are accessed via left click over a character and right click over an open space to bring up the regular main menus for ending your turn or swapping out equipment and checking on character stats. But as i pointed out, the menus and controls as a whole are just sooo off in terms of responsiveness. you can click twice on the screen and nothing happens when trying to pull up the main menu. it's very frustrating when the game itself runs at a perfect 60FPS for me. This is the first time a Jrpg of any kind has run so smoothly in terms of framerate on PC for me since most Japanese game developers don't put much effort into optimization in general for PC. Then again considering how old this game is IT SHOULDN'T BE SHOCKING THAT IT RUNS AT 60FPS.\n\nSeeing as i have less than 1 hour of gameplay i have no clue what the rest of the game is yet but just think.....it took me nearly one hour just to get into the game, get past the first 2-3 battles.......and create my first character........HOW!? I CAN DO THIS SO MUCH FASTER ON MY PS3 OR PS2! It's soooo frustrating because this franchise is my favorite one....period....nothing on my games list compares to how much i like this franchise as a whole. So please NISA....FIX THIS GAME SO WE CAN PLAY IT PROPERLY ON PC!\n\nyes i will say i recommend this game, BUT THIS IS A HEAVY HEAVY WARNING THAT THIS GAME IS NOT A GREAT OR EVEN GOOD PORT.

Welcome back to the front of the Strategy RPG pack, Disgaea. We missed you.\n\nPart of what distinguishes Disgaea from more run-of-the-mill SRPGs is its wicked sense of humor, which makes just unveiling the story a treat.\n\nI have played Disgaea 1-4, unfortunately haven't played 5 yet. I have had no problems with the port and have 6.5 hours into the game as of the time writing this.\n\n\nPositive:+ Stayed true and is what you expect if you played Disgaea 1.\n+ One of the best SRPGs you'll find\n+ Great story with dark humor\n+ Steam trading cards\n+ Achievements\n+ Replayability\n+ PRINNIES\n\nNegatives:- Price, I think it's a bit high, however, I wanted to support the future of more PC ports\n- Controls can be a bit awkward at first with the keyboard. My system is to use only keyboard. I use the mouse if I am targeting during a battle. NiS could patch it so it is simplified by having WASD move the camera and the mouse do the actions, sort of like a CIV 5 type control system.\n- I think some of the character graphics are still pixelated even after the port\n\nAbove Average Game Dood!: 7/10\n\nI don't regret pre-ordering the game and I hope there are more PC ports of classic RPGs. I would recommend getting this at discount if it is your first time playing this sort of game. If you have played the series before, you should definitely get it, dood! Arguably the greatest and most substantial strategy RPG you'll get on the PC.\n\nI never experience any type of video issues that was expressed by other uses. I hear a fix for it is disabling Depth of Field and SSAO. I have VSYNC off as well and it runs at 60FPS and no problems at all.","February 24","true","12.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","6","10","2","0"

Runs great! from what I have read the main issue seems to be FPS (which isn't an issue at all for me) and whoever is using an AMD card lmao, so if you have a problem with either you should be find something else to play. Remember, there is a refund system for a reason.\n\nHopefully the negative reviews won't stop Disgaea from releasing more games within their franchise. Disgaea is the king of turn based combat and the character interactions combined with the story is always entertaining enough to keep me entertained.

The game now runs fine whether using new textures or old textures (for me at least). The only issue I still have is screen tearing, regardless of whether V-sync is on or off, but hopefully that will be fixed, and that alone is not enough for me to not recommend the game.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, these options would be welcome additions:\n\n-It would be nice to be able to use the high quality character portraits with the old UI.\n(I prefer the old UI design, but not the lower quality character artwork.)\n-Ability to change color of menu windows. I'd prefer the option for the new menu UI with black backgrounds and white text.\n-Option to speed up character movement. Similar to how the other games do it.\n-Option to speed up text speed.\n-Turning off the mouse cursor really should just remove it from the screen instead of disabling input from it, but leaving it on the screen.\n\nI don't yet know if some of the characters you could recruit in the DS version that were not recruitable in the PSP version are available for recruiting in this game, but they should be. Note: You could battle against the recruitable characters in the PSP version, and they were fully coded, just not playable until the DS release.\n\n------\n\nOudated:\n\nFirst off, I'd like to say that if you can get past the issues, the game underneath is phenomenal. The soundtrack, story, characters, design are all fantastic. Though the game touts grinding, it is balanced in such a way that it becomes easier to gain levels quickly, the more you advance in the game. Well into the post-game, it's possible to gain thousands of levels in a few minutes.\n\nHowever, as much as I'd love to recommend this game, unless you are hardcore fan of the series, it's not worth it in its current state, as it has a lot of problems (as others have made clear). With pretty much every setting off, it worked fine for me. However, some settings just flat out make the screen go black. The game looks decent with "New Map Textures" on, and "Normal Map" off, but it halves my framerate for essentially better looking backgrounds. With "Old Map Textures," it runs fine, but you get PSP textures. There are issues with screen-tearing, especially in the hub, even with Vsync on. Other reviews indicate that people with far better PCs are having much worse issues.","February 24","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

A chance to play it again, steam achievements, and the possibility of series support on my platform of choice?! Sign me up, Dood!\n\nThen, news of a high-profile gaming website slamming the port as "shoddy" and "unacceptable" started to circulate. I became nervous, and worried that NISA had dropped the ball and doomed my favorite series before it even properly released. Will it be unplayable? Are the graphics options all screwed up? Will it control terribly? I decided to wait patiently for my preorder to unlock and test it myself...\n\nI am happy to report that none of the issues that article reported exist, in my experience. It appears, from doing some research, that the problems reported are entirely random and/or isolated instances that may be due to optimization conflicts. What does that mean to you, review-reader? Well, you could have a perfect experience like I have had thus far: solid 60FPS, zero screen tearing, wonderful mouse response (playing Disgaea with a mouse was something I NEVER expeected to enjoy, but here I am not even hooking up my controller!), and wonderful audio quality. Or you could have less-than-perfect performance, some of which is solveable with a few tweaks on your end. NISA has started collecting data from users who are experiencing issues, so hopefully all of that will be solved in short-order.\n\nNow, this isn't without a few words of warning: some of the new settings are, quite frankly, garbage. Blurring the edge of the screen? PASS! Blurring the characters so that they don't look like their original pixel art style? No way, Dood! Personally, I really like the new (HD) menu style, and the enhanced map graphics. The fact that you have the option to toggle ALL of the changes is fantastic, and I'm glad that NISA realized that the PC community likes to customize their experiences individually.\n\nIf you're interested in a classic Strategy RPG (this is a port of the PSP version, a decade old, of a game that originally released on the PS2 in 2003) that shows a bit of age, but hasn't lost an ounce of the brilliant humor and tactics that made it the cult hit that it was, do yourself a favor and check out Disgaea PC. I can't recommend it enough, and I really hope that the rest of the series begins to make it to Steam in the future.

As of this post, it seems the mouse controls don't always register at first, and it's too easy to accidentally undo an action. I'm just happy the keyboard binds can be changed.\n\nGraphically, the game can't handle Vsync, Depth of Field and SSAO that well ._.

I was looking forward to the mouse controls, as I feel SRPGs can be controlled extremely well with the mouse, and I was throughly dissappointed. Said controls are excessively touchy, and have caused several poor movements (lift and throw) already (5 chapters in), and 2 glitches, one of which crashed my game. However, the instant saving is phenominal, and I would love to see more of the features from other games implemented, such as the more forgiving movement (obviously you can cancel your movements, but in later installments you can just re-move until you actually act). I also would really like to see more of the series ported to the computer, espcially if they work on the mouse controls more.\n\nTLDR: If you own another version, don't bother. If you don't, it's a great game, would reccomend.","March 1","true","45.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I realize in the original game, they didn't have an option for speeding up animations and making messages go by exceedingly fast, but why not make it an option in this game. Don't get me wrong, the game is still great, and I love it dearly, with over 500 hours put into this game alone on ps2, but it makes me kinda just want to play an emulated version, just so I can hold down space to speed up the fights.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Avenkross/recommended/405900/","Avenkross","Mint","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Avenkross/","100 products in account","The oldest game in the series, and as such is not as complex as the other games in the series. Despite being an inferior game to it's sequels in almost every way Disgaea 1 is still an amazing game that can get a lot of mileage out of anyone willing to spend time on it.\n\nOften times I hear people complaining about grind and how it's never a good thing, but really grind is at the core of the Disgaea series, but it's been refined in such a good way. It's as if someone out there went through the effort of figuring out how to make grind appealing.\n\nI can't really pinpoint one thing in particular that makes the mundane task of grinding much more entertaining, but if I had to compare it to something it'd be the progression in things like Cookie Clicker without the whole clicking or automatic aspect. I mean this in the sense that when things seem like they're about to slow down there were typically many ways to make the game go faster. But really, I suppose that the best thing about all of this is that grinding is completely optional and if you strategize properly you'll never have to grind for anything in the storyline. There are many end game bosses that require bosses, but you'll never be absolutely required to grind unless you strategize poorly and end up getting your characters massacred every time you play.\n\nOne of the neat features this game has is something called the "Item World" and what that is is a world inside of an item in the game, and every single item in the game has it's own item world which is 100% randomized every single time. These item worlds have monsters that progressively get stronger based off of the quality of the item you're in as well as the floor you're on. Items can have upwards of 100 floors based on their rarity, and going up in floors increases the stats of items and grants you a chance at running into the "Residents" of the world. Completely seperate from the enemies you will encounter in the item world, Residents are things that can be subdued and transferred from item to item and give really good bonuses such as elemental resistance, higher stats, and increased EXP gains.\n\nReincarnation is another feature that this game has to offer. Although the level cap is 9999 you can still go even further, with reincarnation resetting your level but netting you extra points to spec into your stats depending on what your total level was. You'll also get a bonus to your base stats depending on how high they were when you reincarnated. Reincarnating as a generic may also allow you to promote that unit to a higher ranking if they meet the requirements, which allows you access to higher stats, sometimes better spells, and if applicable better weapon mastery.\n\nThere's really so much to this game that I could go on for days. The game is amazing and if you're looking for a way into the series this is probably one of the better places to start since it's all uphill from here. Disgaea 1 also has the best story and cast in the entire series and everything else after it in that regard isn't as good, so I really hope you're not looking for story in the later titles because they might as well not be there.","March 3","true","14.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is pretty good, the keys are rebindable, there is mouse support and if you wanted to you could use the mouse for everything. The sprites are a little low rez, but this is just a port not a remastering.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, if you sidestep the port problems entirely like I did, this is a pretty good port for what its worth.

Is what you will ask yourself frequently while playing. The story is entertaining and much different than your standard fare of story lines, it doesn't take itself too seriously most of the time, you will laugh at points because of how ridiculous it can be. As for gameplay, it's not the most difficult srpg ever, that's reserved for Final Fantasy Tatics 1.3, an insane difficulty mod, but it can be challenging at times, especially when fighting enemies hundreds of levels higher than yourself. The item world is just an addiction which you can't stop entering and coming back for more. If you like to min-max, and really like to optimize your playstyle, this is a hell of a lot of fun for the price.","March 5","true","101.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Apart from the new UI which I think is great (you can't really stuff text up), it all seems really half-arsed and *worse* in many ways.","February 25","true","46.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While there are no resolution options in the in-gamne menu, by going to window size "user" and dragging the window, you can enlarge the screen. In terms of actual content, it's pretty much the DS port with nicer menus and an updated spriteset, which isn't unwelcome, but also has a bunch of semi-superfluous graphics options that seem to be bogging down the gameplay experience and causing odd bugs. Japanese VA track is present, though -- can't remember if that made it into the DS port, but it certainly wasn't in the original ps2 version.\n\nA few options I'd like to see, above and beyond or in addition to an overall speed optimisation, are options to control the speed the text scrolls at, as well as a way to move quickly in the castle without using the mouse support. (Mouse support, by the way, seems completely fine.) Game is playable, at least for me, but I'd advise skipping through cutscenes and turning off all animations because of the slowness -- which is sad, since the humour and attack animations are quite nice.\n\nAll in all, February seems like it's been a bad month for highly anticipated ports of popular games. Street Fighter V was highly anticipated and released half-finished with a ridiculous price tag, Tales of Symphonia was a collosal wreck of a port, and now Disgaea is having problems, both with the pre-order soundtrack and the game itself. Hopefully, there'll be some speedy improvements from the devs based on customer feedback; like many people, I was super hyped for this launch and would love to have supported further Disgaea and NIS titles coming to Steam, but I can't really do that if the ports are going to be mediocre. Until fixes appear, pass.\n\nEdit: The devs have released fixes, which at least in my own experience, have provided a lot of improvement. While there's still a little while to go (some graphics options aren't super stablised, cave of ordeals 3 crashes), the response from the dev team has been very good and I as a customer feel confident that these issues will be addressed in time. For now, this is far less of a gamble than it used to be, so if you enjoy yourself that crunchy core of Disgaea gameplay, I can recommend it.","February 24","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But let's start with WHY you should play this game if you haven't:\n~Hilarious story/characters\n~Makes grinding actually fun\n~Hundreds of hours of replayability\n~90% of all the bugs have been fixed (all the lethal bugs should be gone now)\n\nNow, why this game is bad from a Disgaea veteran's perspective:\n~So many oppertunities to mod and add mods, gone to waste (subject to change later)\n~It's the EXACT same as the PSP port, just less portable.\n~Once you've played it as long as I have (30 combined story clears across all ports), it just becomes a chore to play again.\n~There could have been SO many more achievements, but there aren't.\n\nReally fun game, and definitely worth getting if you never played the PSP version. If you DO have the PSP version... request access from a friend's library, as the PSP version is pretty much the exact same but portable.\nStill love you, Nippon Ichi Software <3","March 21","true","25.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I have never been a huge fan of dungeon crawlers. I love the old school RPGs like Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger and Secret of Mana, but the creepy yet cute style of this game intrigues me enough to try it. I'm so glad I did! The storyline is wonderful. I loved the characters and the voice acting is amazing. It adds so much to the gameplay. I'm impatient and often find myself mashing the Next button during the longer dialog scenes. Not with Disgaea! I enjoyed every bit and would happily let it play out. 10 out of 10.

The Gatekeeper also happened to be on a tile that had both of these so I had to quit the game. This was more or less within my first 2 hours. And even after that, I still loaded my save up and carried on playing, even went back to the item world only to lose again on the 10th floor thanks to a case of "So near yet so far" on the exit tile and even then, I still went back to the game.\nBasically, Disgaea is a very addicting game, and I'm so glad it's found it's way onto the PC.\nPersonally for me there are some frame rate issues when using certain moves as well as a fixed resolution but don't let that put you off.\nThe characters are just as brilliant and sometimes more cringey than I remembered, the soundtrack is incredible and the fact that you can level up not only your characters but your items as well is what makes this game a joy to always go back to. It's also one of those games where it's fun to grind or at least to me it is.","April 18","true","34.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","2"

I also picked up the DS release, which had the added content of Etna's story mode. It's really no different from that release, and where it is, it's not necessarily in it's favour.\n\nThe reason I'd recommend it is the same reason I'd recommend those versions. The story is fun and engaging, the mechanics are deep enough to allow someone to really get into creating the fighters that they wish and it requires a real investment in time to get the most out of the experience.\n\nThe downside is that the steam release hasn't been done particularly well. The game is unstable, crashing out on a regular basis. This is still happening, several patches down the line. I realize that NIS are putting in the time and the effort to patch the game, and they've been doing good work on that. But frankly, a game that crashes out as often as this probably shouldn't have been released commercially yet. Half the recommended actions to increase stability involve turning off features that are meant to improve the user experience.\nThis game relies heavily on grinding, several of the achievements are named for exactly that. You cannot focus on grinding well when you're aware that you're likely to lose progress often, simply because the game crashed out before you can save.\n\nLike I said, I would recommend this game, but that recommendation depends on your willingness to put up with the bugs. If they do release later titles, I'll probably get them too, but I really hope that NIS puts in more work on the port before release to ensure the game is as good as it should be.","April 7","true","151.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can thankfully say, that this is worth the $20 and works great now.\n\nThis is a review for people who don't know what this game all has.  Keep in mind, I am not an anime fan in the slightest, because of this, I'm very happy that there's a skip storyline option.  Something to note on this though, it doesn't skip introductions and outros for episodes, but it does kill all the filler before battles in the story.  You'll mostly know what's going on with the story because of this, but it does drag on.  A nice option you have with it being on PC, is you can alt-tab while it runs the story and the game will continue to go.  This is great for those especially annoying outros.\n\nAs for the game itself...ho-boy, there's a lot of content.  I've played this game pretty religiously in the past, I think the last time I beat the hardest boss I clocked in 104 hours or so.  There's a lot to this game if you really want to dive in, the story itself will take about 30-45 hours depending on how much you feel like grinding or get side tracked.  There's two story modes, one being really rushy and not that interesting, but still a nice addition and the regular campaign, as well as post-game content and something called the item world.\n\nThe story is pretty standard, you'll go through pre-determined maps to progress the storyline.  Some interesting concepts, that change pretty good to keep you thinking.  This is partly due to Geo Panels which are battlefield bonuses you can control to a certain degree.  Sometimes they're helpful, sometimes they aren't, you get a fair amount of control that's hard to explain without actually playing the game.\n\nThe post game content is presented in a similar fashion, when you unlock it, it has a few levels leading up to a boss usually.  These are side plots that can have their own ending, but often serve as very difficult encounters.  I really like these, in my opinion this is what you push content for.\n\nThen there's the Item World, another difficult to explain concept that ends a lot of variety into the game.  It's a randomly generated map that's created when choose a weapon to enter.  The item generates floors and clearing each one is great for exp, getting new items and it also allows you to level up the weapon, making it even better than it was.  This is where you can spend a majority of the game, or you can also decide not to, I actually beat the game on my 104 hour save file without going into the item world, however if you really want to push your efficiency of your character/s as well as get the truly best gear available, you will have dive deep into the item world.\n\nWith all this there's also a court system, you can pass bills that affect the enemies, increase what you can find for items in the shop and so forth.  If you're having too easy of a time with the game, you can make the enemies harder by passing a bill, or you can make them easier, rebirth, improve your character in other ways and so forth.  It adds another layer to the game can affect all the other things to do.  What's fun too, is if you're having issues passing a bill, you can kill the senate.  These are demon politics afterall!\n\nAll in all, it's one of the best SRPGs you'll find around.  You don't have to worry about too much filler in between battles, the gameplay is very solid and there have been improvements that are found on this version.  I highly recommend it if you're into the genre, even if you don't care for anime.  And if you do, well that's good for you, will help you enjoy the story.","April 11","true","76.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

Is this game perfect? No.\nDo I enjoy it? Yes.\n\nSince you are reading these reviews you must be torn to get this game or not. If you have only played the newer Disgaea games - Ie, 4.D2. and 5, I would stay away from the computer port, and just  emulate the psp/DS version of it, as it had a few nice Quality of life features, such as faster dialog. If you have played all of them before, give this game a chance.\n\nGameplay- Disgaea follows a typical TRPG system- Make unit, Select unit, Move unit, Kill unit. Gain exp... Oh, and throw Prinnys Dood. The place where Disgaea is different, is the exp system. Most games let you go to level 99, or if your lucky 999. Disgaea says no to that, with a soft level cap of 9999 and a 'optimal' level cap of  186,000.\nGiven that TRPG's are the best kind of RPG's I have to give this part a 9/10\n\nStory- Demons, Demonesses, Angels, Flonnes, Prinnys. You play as Laharl; a 1313 year old demon child, who has just awoken from a 2 year slumber to find out that his father, King Krichevskoy, ruler of the Netherwold is dead. This has caused most of the Kings vassals to take off, or to try to take Laharls place as the overlord. Thus, Laharl needs to take the throme back by force.\n8/10. Probably the best story in the Disgaea series,  A good mix of comedy, story telling, and drama.\n(My personal story ranking- 1,2,5,4,3, D2)\n\nPort- I have not put enough time into the game to give this too much thought, however, it seems to be an almost identical port to the Psp version, with a few extra options added. The options are- New maps, new sprites (Which look terrible) New menus, V-sync, screen size, SSAO, DOF, Screen Blur, and Shadows. (30-60 FPS)\n7/10. Not much to say, seems like a straight port.\n\nPerformance- This is where the problem lies for some people. Do you have an AMD GPU? Your in for a bad time. Do you like the new features they added? (V-sync, SSAO, ect) Your in for a bad time. Luckily for me, I have neither of the main problem causers, so the game runs at a smooth 60 fps.\n9/10. This score is only based on the performance I get.\n\nOverall score- 8/10.  It's a decent port of a great series with a few quality of life features missing. If you like the series and want NIS to port more of the series, go ahead an give em $20.\n\n(For context- Running Windows 7, GTX 970, 16GB, i7-4770)","February 24","true","6.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's not even like a straight up port. They've added stuff.\n\nReally, that's good enough for me. Japanese developers just don't do PC. They don't. It's not a thing in Japan. So when they make little baby steps towards the PC market, can you really blame them when they screw up? Dark Souls: Prepare to Die was an interesting little boat in the water and debatably it was around then that Japanese devs started trying to throw their games out on platforms like Steam, to see if the western world really wants what they're selling. And now where at today, where more and more Japanese games are being published on Steam. Sure, there's a ridiculously huge flood of VNs of every kind, but that's okay, because we also are starting to get games like Disgaea PC, Guilty Gear Xrd, 60fps Dark Souls 2, and a simultaneous PC release of Dark Souls 3.\n\nThis is an exciting time.\n\nI'd say we want what Japan is offering us.

It's exactly how I remembered playing it back on the PS2 all those years ago.  If you're looking for a faithful version of it (and hate the idea of buying an old system or *shudder* a PSP), then this will be the place to be!  Yes, I am a fan-boy of the franchise which really means I'd be first in line to bash this game if it were bad.

I opted out of it and since then I've had a steady 60FPS, even during big effects.","February 25","true","4.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkripjaww/recommended/405900/","darkripjaww","darkseth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkripjaww/","109 products in account","To start this off... Is this game perfect? No.\nDo I enjoy it? Yes.\n\nSince you are reading these reviews you must be torn to get this game or not. If you have only played the newer Disgaea games - Ie, 4.D2. and 5, I would stay away from the computer port, and just  emulate the psp/DS version of it, as it had a few nice Quality of life features, such as faster dialog. If you have played all of them before, give this game a chance.\n\nGameplay- Disgaea follows a typical TRPG system- Make unit, Select unit, Move unit, Kill unit. Gain exp... Oh, and throw Prinnys Dood. The place where Disgaea is different, is the exp system. Most games let you go to level 99, or if your lucky 999. Disgaea says no to that, with a soft level cap of 9999 and a 'optimal' level cap of  186,000.\nGiven that TRPG's are the best kind of RPG's I have to give this part a 9/10\n\nStory- Demons, Demonesses, Angels, Flonnes, Prinnys. You play as Laharl; a 1313 year old demon child, who has just awoken from a 2 year slumber to find out that his father, King Krichevskoy, ruler of the Netherwold is dead. This has caused most of the Kings vassals to take off, or to try to take Laharls place as the overlord. Thus, Laharl needs to take the throme back by force.\n8/10. Probably the best story in the Disgaea series,  A good mix of comedy, story telling, and drama.\n(My personal story ranking- 1,2,5,4,3, D2)\n\nPort- I have not put enough time into the game to give this too much thought, however, it seems to be an almost identical port to the Psp version, with a few extra options added. The options are- New maps, new sprites (Which look terrible) New menus, V-sync, screen size, SSAO, DOF, Screen Blur, and Shadows. (30-60 FPS)\n7/10. Not much to say, seems like a straight port.\n\nPerformance- This is where the problem lies for some people. Do you have an AMD GPU? Your in for a bad time. Do you like the new features they added? (V-sync, SSAO, ect) Your in for a bad time. Luckily for me, I have neither of the main problem causers, so the game runs at a smooth 60 fps.\n9/10. This score is only based on the performance I get.\n\nOverall score- 8/10.  It's a decent port of a great series with a few quality of life features missing. If you like the series and want NIS to port more of the series, go ahead an give em $20.\n\n(For context- Running Windows 7, GTX 970, 16GB, i7-4770)","February 24","true","6.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Like I mentioned before, the cast are parodies of anime and RPG tropes, but they retain enough of their own personality to feel like actual people instead of simply jokes. Even the secondary characters are given variation in both their personalities and design. By that I mean there are no throwaway characters because each one feels so unique and different.\n\nThe Story:\nCampy and purposefully silly, Disgaea’s story is rife with comedy and references, but not so much as to ruin the atmosphere. The serious moments are kept appropriately dramatic, but there are times when something goofy happens that can break the tension. These times; however, are kept out of the more serious moments.\n\nMechanics:\nDespite its age the game’s system is still fun and its various features like “The Item World”, “The Dark Assembly” greatly spice up the game.  What would be an otherwise tedious grind is saved by conveniences and distractions offered by your ability to bribe or crush the assembly, or grab some stuff in the Item World.","March 10","true","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I can't get enough of it. The magic tutoring system is also amazing. You can spend very little mana to get a good-for-nothing pupil, who will teach the master their spell type by standing close to them and it leveling to rank 1, then just delete the pupil to free up your character list.

It's always humorous when I play Witcher 3 at max specs, but I can't get over 20 fps when I switch over to Disgaea.  Don't write the game off, though.  Once it's patched up, I will sink 1000 hours into this game.\n\nAnd just so people don't assume I'm runing a computer from 1980, these are my specs:\n\nWin 10 Pro\nGTX 980Ti\nInte. I7-4960 @ 3.60 GHz\n32 GB RAM\n\nEdit:\nI've played enough of the game now to tell how good the port is.  In short, it's not great.  To those who feel that the mouse controls are bad, I agree.  However, turn off the mouse controls and just use the keyboard.  Moving around on a big map is a pain, but it's much better than the mouse controls.  7/10 for the port.\n\nThe game holds up well, though.  Some of the later games have some features that give them advantages; but as a stand-alone game, I still give it a 9/10.  This is a game about grinding, and it makes no apologies for that.  You can play through the core game with just Laharl, so people who don't like exploring the limits of the various systems will really hate this game.  Anyone who has ever complained "you can just press x and win" will hate this game.\n\nEdit2:\nI've run into the same problem others have.  The game crashes after about an hour or so.  This effectively makes the item world off-limits.  This is very sad for me.  This is the perfect game to scratch that occasional grinding itch I get.  Hopefully they can fix this.  I still give the game a thumbs up, though, because you can still get max level, and finish the game without any trouble.","February 25","true","31.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I loved Hour of Darkness, and then I loved it again when it was Afternoon of Darkness. And now I love it again, as it's now Disgaea PC. It's truly a game for hardcore gamers who don't merely tolerate but *relish* the grind, who have no qualms about dedicating three hours to gain a 0.01% stat increase, who want to power up characters to ridiculous degrees, and all that great stuff.\n\nThe only thing I'd add to my official review is that it seems to crash a lot lately, and this always seems to happen on the 10th floor of an Item World, when one of the monsters uses Air Assault. Sometimes it's a different ability, but it happens with some regularity. There's no Quick Save feature (Why not? This is 2016. You mean to tell me, NISA, that you can't have the game auto-save upon loading each new floor of the Item World, allowing us to resume from that floor in the event of crashing? Considering this is the PC version and crashes about once every 4 hours, I think it's prudent to have such a feature.), so if you make it to Floor 100 of an item and the game crashes, you're just ♥♥♥♥ed--all that grinding, gone. That's not acceptable in a game like this, where grinding is the main appeal. Grinding is certainly one thing--redoing a grind because the game crashed is yet another.\n\nIn honor of Disgaea, I can only score this game 357,477,952,188 / 498,110,387,298.\n\nFix the crashing, or implement an auto-save so that we can resume from the last floor we completed in the event of a crash. I've had this happen once at Floor 22/30, but I can't imagine how horrible it would be to have this happen on the 90th floor of a Legendary. It's already enough to make me want to stop playing in disgust, because the failure to include such an auto-save (a la the Final Fantasy re-releases, where Quick Saving deletes the save file as soon as it's loaded, to prevent save scumming) is a gross lack of consideration for the end users.\n\nIf you're not the type to get carried away in the Item World chasing after a total of 185,000 levels, then I can easily recommend Disgaea PC. If you *are* that type, then wait until it crashes less frequently, or until they've implemented an Auto-Save.\n\nOr emu--I mean, just wait until they do something that shows they care about the countless hours of grinding that people are losing.","March 8","true","71.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Again, I'm not saying they have a good reason, or that no one should give a ♥♥♥♥, quite the opposite, just saying it's hardly an issue.\n\nThat was it.\n\nMany were having problems FPS and such, and those who were, were on a GTX 980Ti.\nI, never experienced this though.\n\nPC controls are ♥♥♥♥, get literally, any controller.\nby that I mean modern console controllers\n\nThe buttons they have use 1-10 rather than whatever controller you're using.\nSo instead of A B X Y/shapes you have 12345678\n\nThe controls on the controller aren't even finished believe it or not.\n\nWhat I mean is, you wanna zoom out? well you have to use Square/X and Left trigger!\nRather than just using left bumper or trigger...\n\nYeah, this was ported from the PSP supposedly, if so they certainly did upgrade alot. Or just used assets from the PS2 version, like they should've ported anyways.\n\nNew ♥♥♥♥:Nothing new. PSP ♥♥♥♥'s not in here, DS ♥♥♥♥'s also not in here.\nThere's new drawings n stuff, not for spirtes, that's fine, but the UI is terrible. It looks like someone spent 20 minutes in Paint.net and said "IT LOOKS CLEAN SO IT IS" It fits the game like a small ball in a square hole. Oh sure it went in, but it's not a square.\n\n"Just use the old option in settings"\n\nThis uses the old blurry drawings though. The GUI looks like it was squeezed into a small box for 2 months, then pulled out and slapped in. it's scaled horridly, basically.\n\n\n\nThere is new voice acting, but the only one to absolutely frustrate me to no bounds was Etna's.\n\nMaybe it's a new voice actor, but this is the worst acting having nothing to do with what's going on I've ever heard.\n\nAnd you know something, the voice acting, it's good, really good, the voice actor fits Etna very well.\n\n"So why's it bad?"\n\nIt sounds like the VA was either reading the entire script from the ending to the top, or was emailed the lines to take, never played Disgaea, never saw disgaea, nor had someone to tell her "this is how you emote this scene"\n\nIt's like she was blind to the entire situation that the story and her character took place in. It's so out of place.\n\nIf you disagree, then you've no doubt got 0 idea on how voice acting works. As a voice actor myself, this ♥♥♥♥, is wildly unnacceptable. The old Etna voice actually fit the scene, there was clear direction. She had someone give her some damn context.\n\nThe new one has 0 direction and sounds like out of context lines slapped into context while not fitting it at all.\nAnd that's to no fault of the actor. It sounds like she's putting her best in there, but has no ♥♥♥♥ing clue what's going on.\n\nEnd note:\nThe game's great, very grindy, it's a "banned to an island for the rest of eternity and this is all you have to play" game.\n\nIf you have ♥♥♥♥ to do, get Cheat Engine. Other wise, enjoy the great characters.\n\n\nRating:\n\nPort: 8/10\nReplace the confused actor with one who was actually ♥♥♥♥in' directed.\nMake the new GUI fit in/make there be an option for (fixed) old gui and new drawings.\nFix, the ♥♥♥♥in, mouse controls. Also give me the ability to remove mouse cursor.\nFinish the controls in general.\n\nGame: 8/10\nToo much god damn grinding with not enough shortcuts that won't result in a slightly faster mindless grinding.\nEverything else is something I'd call the beginning of greatness, but the peak of it as well.","March 3","true","19.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

This should fix all of your problems with graphical and performance issues.\n\nThe controls are wonky at best. I reccomend a controller more than the other options. The mouse doesn't register that you've clicked sometimes, so if you are using a mouse, hitting K while hovering over something is probably better than using left click. Keyboard controls are not very good but not very bad, "meh" if you will.\n\nThe newly added textures are good but some are lower res than others, which can look a bit weird. Also, you cannot speed up text prompts and the settings menu is really weird, this is more of a bit of annoyance. Note that there is no borderless window mode, resolution settings.\n\nOverall I reccomend this game to anyone who can put up with these issues and has played a SRPG (like FF:Tactics), but it is not acceptable to release a game in this state.\n\nWill update the more I play.","February 24","true","0.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

Missing a couple of features, and appears to be running poorly on some peoples computers, which is unfortunate, as it runs perfectly fine on my rig. The best part, though, is running Disgaea at 1080p without any aliasing or jaggies, looks good and is now pretty much the definitive version of the game (in features and appearance!). Considering this is a port of a game which came to be in 2003, they certainly took their time getting it onto PC. Looks interesting to you and want to get into the series? This review will try to quickly give you an idea of the game without spoiling the things that matter.\n\nAs for the game itself, it's a heavily gameplay focused RPG with a story tailored to entertainment value. Things only get serious around the last few chapters. Disgaea heavily values the player, giving you a multitude of ways to strengthen your characters and eventually create a monstrosity that can one-shot everything. However, ther isn't much to guide you much making said monstrosity. These things are mostly for the hardcore audience, you can bring characters to level 9999, then bring them back to level 1 with bonuses to make them become even stronger. If you like streamlining in your games and having everything be simple to understand, this has very little. They explain the basic mechanics of the game, and let you figure out everything else and devise your own strategies, both in gameplay and system. You should not know everything about how to play Disgaea going into it for the first time. To close this off, I think it's a game that you should absolutely own if you enjoy customization, strategy RPG's and pushing the limits of a game.\n\nBy the way... This game is lacking in many convenience features that future games include to make things more fun or convenient. However I still reccomend playing this game first, as you could easily discredit the earlier games by playing more modern versions. There really are a lot of great features added in later releases, but you'll be missing out on a great game if you play them first.","February 24","true","8.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

And while the controller support is a bit bugged at the moment, just install the pretty prinny mod and it should work doods. Seriously, if you like turn-based games and/or strategy games doods, buy this and you won't regret it.","March 1","true","1.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There haven't been any FPS issues since it was patched recently, but there are some crashes here and there so remember to save frequently.\n\nThe main story of the game can easily be finished without any grinding in a few hours with the final boss being level 90 in a game with a maximum level of 9999, but there's always more to do, as you'll likely lose yourself grinding levels and powering your items to beat the hardest boss. The main cast of characters are great, with their interactions being really entertaining, and there being a great amount of humor being thrown around the game. Although the game is rather old, it still holds up and hopefully there will be more ports of the disgaea series :)\n\n","March 6","true","90.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Back in my console only days I enjoyed a plethora of titles from Altus, NI, Square, and many others. Since going (more or less) full PC I've been missing the ability to play one of my most beloved genres. Most SRPG titles on PC hadn't really been up to what I really missed. Then Disgaea was released for the PC.\n\nIf you are not familiar with Disgaea it is along running series of grind heavy SRPGs with a strong dose of humor. In the first title you play the son of the Demon Overlord who is going after the vacant crown. There are MANY challenges between you and the crown... some hard, some funny, many both.\n\nPros\nThey ported Disgaea to PC. If it does well they could port more titles!\nIt's the same game play as the original\nIncredible replay value\nSilly humor\nUnique story\nRandomly generated levels through the item world\n\nCons\nAudio sometimes cuts out until the game is restarted\nSome people report some slowdown bugs (though I haven't hit any)\n\nNote\nI do worry that the response by some players to some of the bugs might push the publisher back to being console only. That would be a disaster for SRPG fans. Yes, there are bugs but helping them run them down and fix is a better response.

Crazy ways to get what you want, how you want. Humorous stories with some surprisingly emotional moments that make you adore the characters. Takehito Harada's varied, vibrant character designs. The catchy tunes by Tenpei Sato.\n\nThe original Disgaea, now ported here to Steam, is where it all started. The port's had a bit of a rocky start--mixed performance for many (but with temporary solutions present). NIS has thankfully made it clear (quickly and detailed, too) that they are aware and are working to solve the issues. That's plenty more initiative than other developers grant. Give it a go despite what you've heard; even if it doesn't work well on your system no matter what you try, it's still playable enough and there's an effort to fix out there.\n\nAs far as the first Disgaea compares to its peers, it certainly has one of the most well-woven marriages of story and characters in its grand scheme. Unfortunately, to be honest, having played the living daylights out of later games in the series, I found myself constantly missing nice things implemented later and the snail's pace by comparison. Don't let that deter you though, the first Disgaea is still an incredibly fine game and I just hope that later installments land on Steam as well!","February 24","true","63.1"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

The problem is porting it to PC, it just isn't working for me. Some of you might be doing better, but the headache I'm getting from this port is terrible.\n\nSome patches have been released, but there are more problems being made for each patch.\n\nCrashes, controller issues, slow framerates, all problems I've had or am having.\n\nThe worst is my save data. It keeps making the game freeze. I try to load, and it freezes. Delete the save data and use the cloud backup, and it works a few times, only to do it again! Now, I've lost progress, albeit only a little, because the game froze when i tried to save! And I mean froze hard! Ctrl+alt+del to bring up task manager did nothing, alt-tab did nothing. I literally had to hold my power buttong down to power off, and reboot.\n\nDisgaea is a great game, but the PC version it, at this time, a total waste. If you have a PS2, PSP, or DS/3DS, buy the versions for those consoles to play this game, as it is fun and funny. Your PC is better used for playing other games.\n\nI may change this review if Disgaea PC becomes patched to stability.\n","March 18","false","24.5"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

If you're one of those that missed those eras *glances at dusty but working PS2 as well as PSP that was purchased specifically for the Disgaea ports* then GET IT NOW.\n\nStoryline-wise, it's an excellent tale of a young (by demon standards 1,313 is young, apparently) demon prince waking up after sleeping for two years to find out his father is dead and all the overlord's vassals are gone. Heck, its a power struggle even - most of them are trying to take over the Netherworld instead of serving him. Time to beat them down, take his rightful place as the next Overlord and save the Netherworld from the machinations of an Archangel along the way. Despite the sounds of all of this, it manages to mantain a light hearted tone along the way, inserting all sorts of humor into the dialogue scenes. Enough to make you smile, but not enough to be tiresome. Total playtime can be around 40-60 hours from just running the story alone. The rest comes from the item world, optional postgame and how much you want to grind out 'perfect' characters.\n\nAs for the gameplay...it's pretty comparable to Final Fantasy Tactics. If you didn't play that, Disgaea is a turn based strategy that takes place on grid based maps involving use of units of certain classes to hammer one another until you win or get wiped. You can deploy a maximum of 10 units at any given time of various classes as either a Human unit or a Monster unit. Humans may equip different types of weapons and learn to master them at different rates based on class. For example, Larhal doesn't favor fist weapons but can still learn those at a significantly slower rate than spears or swords, his preferred weapons. Each level of weapon mastery (experience is granted by attacking with weapons, to a maximum of level mastery 255) translates to 5% bonus on the weapon class stats as well as additional special moves being unlocked at certain levels. That said, monsters do not have weapon mastery (though they have their own class of 'Monster Weapons') but instead have better stat growths to compensate. Personally, I didn't bother with monsters in this game and never did until Disgaea 3 (looks at Vita). They can be decently powerful, but I preferred to field Majins and Angels (top tier unit classes) instead. Hell, I considered them underpowered in this game - but this is just PERSONAL preference. Your milage may differ. Geo Panels also add a depth to the tactics, making some squares on the field have special effects. One effect might damage 20% hp of a unit standing on the square. Another might heal 20% instead. Or it might even be Invincibility. It could cover the map or it could just be a 9x9 grid on a map 5x that. Or it might be all over the frickin place.\n\nGrinding is pretty fun in this game, compared to grind for the sake of grinding type games. The Item World, a hallmark of the Disgaea series, allows you to delve into an item to clear random maps in it (30, 60, 100 floors for common, rare, legendary items) and power it up. It's an excellent waste of time.\n\n\n\nSummary\nSome assumptions made. Figure it's a direct port of PSP or DS version to PC. May be missing stuff like optional Japanese voicing.\n\nPros:\n+ "A horse weiner?! Now THAT'S dangerous! Be careful guys!" - Larhal. Great humor.\n+ Excellent gameplay, great storyline.\n+ Balances seriousness and humor perfectly.\n+ Great music score.\n+ Can take as little as 40-60 hours or as many as several thousand depending on you.\n+ Can turn off animations when you get bored of it. No waiting 30 seconds just to see you one shot every enemy in a 3x3 grid.\n+ Can turn on Japanese voices.\n\nCons:\n- Monsters never felt good to me. Lack of weapon mastery gimped them far too much in my books.\n- Flonne's English voice actor hurt my ears at times.\n- Lacks challenge past a certain point, but you'd be done with postgame stuff and probably grinding Item World to perfect items at this point.\n- Lacks character recolor system, added into later games. Means all your characters of the same class and tier will look the same.\n- If it's the PSP port, lacks the option to recruit Plenair, the mascot character of the sprite designer responsible for the Disgaea series' characters.\n- Feels slightly choppy on full widescreen (i7 3770, GTX 660, 8GB RAM). Smooth on windowed. Can resize the windowed though.\n- They didn't bother to put in a Y/Triangle button skip function for the opening sequence - again. Oh well.\n\nYou decide:\n-+ If you go with the time wasting and postgame stuff, your party will probably consist exclusively of Majins and/or Angels. You CAN use other stuff, but these are the two powerhouses of the game, unlocked after a bit of grinding.\n\nNow, if you excuse me, I'm off on a trip down memory lane.\n\nPS: For the people that have played this before and just got it on PC because reasons, can confirm Etna Mode code works (using a 360 controller but whatever, probably works with the keyboard bindings).","February 24","true","18.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I still have my copy for the DS that I love so very much so it's good to have it in my hands with full voice acting. The DS release sadly had very little to speak of for voicing due to the limitations it had, but the PC version made me overjoyed to hear more dialogue read aloud by the characters.\n\nControls are as expected. Takes getting use to for directions on the map, but once you're good you're good. Battles run pretty smooth, haven't noticed any glitches thus far. And yeah, the resolution of the sprites and weapons might be an issue to some, but it's a port so that's not an issue in my book.\n\nAll in all it's an enjoyable game, and if you're looking to enjoy a good strategy JRPG with some comical humor and chapter base story and tons of hidden quests to take on then this is definitely worth a look at.","February 24","true","9.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Which, incidentally, the framerate is tied to the speed of the game, So you'll have to quit to the menu and reload unless you like playing a game at halfspeed.\n\nIt could be worse I suppose. I imagine Nis America doesn't usually export 10 year old games from the PS2 over to PC, so like i said, it could have been a disaster with the amount of experience they had to work with.\n\nOther than that, its a great updated version of the original and im very much looking forward to completing the game...without ssao and shadows to maintain that 60fps.","February 24","true","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Now to focus more on this specific port; It has changed keybindings into numbers 1,2,3 etc. and use those to direct you on what to do and it is the same for a controller (atleast xbox360).

On a first glance (what, nearly an hour?) I've not had a single issue.\n\nIn a weird twist from a Japanese developer porting a console game to PC, the controls are actually surprisingly intuitive, not to mention actually listed with keyboard keys rather than controller keys in the game itself (I hate games that tell me to press X when they mean the controller X not the keyboard X, a minor pet peeve of mine).\n\nAudio seems to have been remastered somewhat - though I could be just remembering the PSP's not so stellar audio.\n\nAll in all, if you like Disgaea games it's worth the buy - if you have any of the currently reported FPS issues you can refund it, and most of the graphics bugs are related to the new graphics options (which, in my opinion are not needed anyway); these can all be turned off in the menu.","February 24","true","33.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It was a bummer that it had such a bad launch but seriously the game has become tons better. As a person who has played the PS2 and DS version. This is a pretty true port of both of those versions. Yes the game is 15 years old. Yes the graphics are a bit dated. Yeah the game play is a bit simple for an SRPG. But you know what the story line, antics of the characters, and just the shear ammount of hours and playability in the game make it VERY worth the 20 bucks you will pay for this game. If you are an SRPG fan then grab Disgaea and have fun. trust me you won't regret it.","April 24","true","11.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you are just looking for something old to play or just want a goofy story, then ya you might enjoy playing this one.  Sadly a terrible port, so many things can go wrong.  Of course the typical stuck up Japanses gaming companies that seem to not give a darn about their console to pc ports or the gaming community recently for that matter is strong with this one!  Sad to see NIS a company that I once purchased a lot of game from go down this route.  Crashing in the middle of Item World causes a lot of heart burn!\n\nOf course the good old grind is there, but the disgaea series typically makes grinding less painful if you just want the story, but if you are going for the haul of perfecting your items, characters, & monsters then you are in for some long long nights.\n\nSadly the game still has terrible balance issues, if you know how to farm well you can power level in the item world if you look out for the stages where clone and invicibility are together, and while this is not as easy as it may sound, just a single good farm of this stage and you can litterally power level several units by hundreds of levels at a time heck and not even go past the first chapter.\n\nBut it does have to be said... no one does tactical turnbased combat as well as Disgaea.   At least in my opinion, but at the end of the day, this game is just too long in the tooth, maybe if the port was better or they actually upgraded the sprites too I would give it a thumbs up, but all things being equal, pick it up on discount.  It does not serve the gaming comunity if we keep buying minimal effort rehashed games at full price!","April 16","false","25.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Since this is all an absolutely key, integral part of the game, and you cannot save or exit the item world until completing a grueling 10 levels or abandoning progress completely, you will find you cannot actually progress in most cases-  6 out of 7 times, it will crash on me before you finish.\n\nThe gameplay itself is enjoyable-  very in-depth, many things to collect and customize, fun characters and classes, colorful if simple, mostly 2D visuals, and great music.\nIt is, however, rather tedious-  a game focused on grinding levels-  and the story is extremely lacking and ditzy.  The sound is very, very repetative and obnoxious, with voice-acting that in either English OR Japanese will make you claw your ears off-  you know, the typical obnoxious, whiny child voices noone ever wanted to hear.\n\nGraphics:  7/10\nMusic:  10/10\nSound:  2/10\nGameplay:  7/10\nStability:  1/10\nTotal:  26/50\n\nFrankly, this would have been a good game, but we're THREE patches in and it's still a bust.

The game is a great game when it was on the PS2, and I enjoyed hundreds of hours of play in it that could be explained as "mindless grinding."\n\nThat being said, I do not recommend buying Disgaea for the PC. At least not unless the problems the game has are fixed.\n\nNamely:\n1 - Large FPS drop during combat sometimes with graphics settings enabled, sometimes with them disabled.\n2 - Inability to change the overly slow Text-Scroll Speed\n3 - Slow character movement during combat, even if the rest of combat progresses at a normal pace.\n4 - Poor optimization for keyboard control (ties in with #1)\n\nI will be going back to playing my Disgaea games on consoles from now on until this has been fixed. If you truly enjoyed Disgaea for the PS2, don't bother trying to play it on here.\n\nSorry NISA, I like you guys. But this was definitely not ready for release. We should not need obscure workarounds to get the game to a functional, enjoyable level. The dialogue speed is painful enough without the other issues with the game.

Not bad, definitely not terrible, but when core functionality does not work properly (eg dodgy mouse controls) you cannot call it good.  Serviceable at best.\n\nThe art is nice, the music surprisingly good and the plot quite entertaining.  Humour is always YMMV, but I liked it.  It definitely helps to have at least a basic appreciation for the Japanese TV references.  The core gameplay, however, was disappointing.  It is a decent Tactical RPG, a genre barely represented on PC, but compared to its peers there are some serious issues.  The way experience is handled cripples certain classes and emphasises one or two over-powered Rambo characters over a balanced and tactial squad (the normal for the genre).  This makes a lot of the potential gameplay elements irrelevant, because attempting to explore them weakens you and makes the game more grindy/less fun.  The randomised Item World maps are an interesting concept, but can occationally be impossible to complete, resulting in wasted time.\n\nThere is a market for this game, but I think it is a very small one.

I got a refund on this game at that time, and have not played the working version of the game, but I still find the lack of button icons to be a non-starter.\n\nThis port is surprisingly awful. I'm used to quality products from NISA, particularly their flagship Disgaea line. This is a huge disappointment.\n\nIn addition to the problems listed in Destructoid's article (http://www.destructoid.com/the-pc-port-of-disgaea-is-an-absolute-mess-344192.phtml), I want to add one major complaint of my own. The game doesn't show icons for the controller buttons at all. Instead, it gives you numbers, leaving you to guess which controller button they are referencing by number until you memorize them. Seriously, you couldn't afford to get button icons in the game?\n\n*When I purchased this game, it was unplayable and crashed multiple times. I hear that's been fixed, as well as many of the slowdown and graphical issues, but as I got a refund on the game, I can't comment on this any further.

I do recommend Disgea: Hour of Darkness, the game this is a port of. However, I can not recommend this version.  As others have mentioned, it's bad bad bad bad.\n\nFirst: They've introduced new map textures, small visual updates to the terrain. This is good, but pretty much every other setting introduced has to be turned off. V-sync must be turned off. You can not run the game in full screen (You can however do windowed mode and increase it to full screen size). Otherwise, you will see a huge DPS drop, screen tearing, weird random clipping lines on the terrain that never go away.\n\nSecond: Controller support is odd, because no matter what you use, it seems to always use a button layout of "3,4,5" Which just makes no sense when playing with any controller, obviously. Even when using a controller, the cursor is always active on screen as well, but you can drag it to the side. This can cause FPS drop as well.\n\nTL;DR    The game is good. This port is not.

When I saw that it was being ported to PC I was all for it. However, what I ended up getting was a bit of a mess.\n\nI personally hadn't experienced any issues with the game within the first couple hours of the game. I had seen many people having issues with the frame rate, and stating that textures weren't loading. I had a smooth 60fps experience and all my textures loaded fine. I had to change all the new graphical settings off and use the old textures and UI, but that didnt' bother me much. I didn't even change the settings because of performance issues. I did it because the enhanced graphical options look terrible. Funny that the enhancements didn't enhance anything.\n\nMy real issue is when after having played the game for three hours it just stopped working. Not like it would crash in the middle of playing it, but the game just wouldn't start up. Every time I tried to play it it would crash before the game window would show up.\n\nI can say that Disgaea is a great game, and I encourage anyone who is a fan of strategy games to check it out, but honestly you'd have better luck buying it for any of the other platforms that the game was released on then buying it on PC in its current state.","February 26","false","3.2"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","7","20","0","0"

This port is such a dissapointment I cannot even properly express it in words, but I will try.\n\nFirst of all, there are no resolution settings and all the new "enhancements", when turned on, create weird visual bugs. Especially SSAO - turning that on resulted in a chess board design that covered my screen. I do not know, maybe this port was orignally based on a FTP chess game.\n\nAnd WTF, the framerates. Considering the type of game this is, how is it possible for it to fluctuate between 20 and 60 frames constantly? I do not have a top of the line rig, but I believe my setup is decent enough (970gtx, 16GB RAM, i5 processor) to handle a game originally made in 03.\n\nThe only good thing about this port is that the new textures do look better. The background looks brighter and less muddy and the text is in higher resolution. However all of this does not matter when the game lags for no reason and the controls feel very sluggish. Speaking about controls, the game uses generic "1", "2", "3", etc buttons in the dialogue boxes regardless of what controller you're using. Yup, no way to set the control type to Xbox or PS.\n\nHonestly, if you (the developers) do not know how to make a proper port, then do not do it, or find someone who can. Just leave these classic titles for the original consoles they were made for.\n\nMaybe they will patch it, maybe not. We shall see.\n\n0/10 exploded prinnies\n\nOn the plus side, not playing this game will give me more time to write my thesis, lmao\n\nEDIT: It has been brought to my attention that the game no longer suffers from framerate issues and visual bugs. Indeed, I launched the game again and I was able to turn on all the enhancements while maintaining a stable 60 fps.

Why shouldn't I track down a used copy of one of them for less then 20 bucks, and enjoy this game on the go?\nIf this goes on sale, or they put some more work into remastering this ill be happy to give it a second chance. But, as it is right now it's still not worth 20 bucks. I'd rather track down a used copy of Disgaea DS, or play a newer game in the franchise.\n\nEdited, given recent improvements and time to think over my fustration as I refunded the game.\nExtremely dissapointed. Aweful PC port, riddled with UI Bugs, and and new feature exclusive to the PC Edition is  buggy.\n\nI'd be OK with that if this was a realitively new game, but it isn't. This is a step back in every way from newer games in the franchise, and the original PS2 release.\n\nI was excoted to give this game a try. I've heard great things! But this is a joke. I should go get a Vita and play Disgaea 4 or something so I can give this a proper chance.\n\nI had to request a refund for this game. If I wanted this, without the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t it brings I would just track down a used copy of the game for the PS2 for less then 20 bucks.","February 27","false","0.9"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","3"

Or leave a constructive comment instead? Thanks)\n\nSo... they fixed the performance issues... i guess... i will admit, the game is running way better now but i still have some issues with some attack animations. (and i still think that the game should be running better than this).\nBtw, my game did not work at all after this update so i had to delet the game and donwload it again. (just a nitpick)\nBut really... i CANT give a positive review... i'm sorry.\nThis is a game that i already beat on my PS2 and PSP so many times and i still have fun with it, when the PC version was announced i was hyped (to play a game that i already got 101% out of, weird i know.) but this thing's first impression was more than terrible, it was awful and soul crushing. Where is the OST? Nowhere to be found! (Yes, they did mention that they are going to do something special with it or something, so... that's why it's not here yet, but i dont care! that was the only reason everyone had to pre-order this game). <<< UPDATE HERE! (As 03/23/2016, one month after the game's launch, the 10 remastered tracks for Disgaea are here... I dont care anymore and i didn't like what they did with the songs, and yes only 10 tracks... f you.)\nThey did fix the game (apparently) but that was the least they could have done to their consumers.\nAt the end of the day for me, it's like >> I dont give a s**t anymore you know?\nI can play this on my PS2 or PSP anyway, having this game on the pc looking better than ever was  the only thing that i was looking forward the most (and i wanted to give more money to Nippon ichi as a "thank you" for all those hours of fun with the other versions) well... that and the OST (that, at the time that this review was made, we still don't got it).\nAs you can see this was more than a disappointment, i usually don't review games this way but this case is special, i could refund this game like a lot of people did but i'll let this one slide.\nPlease don't judge the series based on this disappoint port! That's the only thing i ask you guys.\nHere is a list of only some of the great games that nippon ichi have offered us.\n\n* La pucelle (PS2 and PSP(Japan only))\n* Disgaea 1 and 2 (PS2, DS and PSP)\n* Phantom Brave (PS2, PSP and WII)\n* Makai kingdom (PS2 and PSP)\n* Soul Nomad and the God eaters (PS2)\n* Zettai Hero Project Unlosing Ranger vs. Darkdeath Evilman (PSP)\n* Prinny can i really be the hero? (PSP)\n\nThey still have my respect and admiration even after this terrible Disgaea PC bu*****t.\n____________________________________________________________________\nWell... i expected more than this...\nGreat game - Not so good port\nIf you have a weak machine dont bother... (Yes! its a port of a 2003 ps2 game but trust me... its poorly optimized. Well... if you can play with a screen size smaller than a cell phone you are good to go.)\nWhat a shame. I AM a huge Disgaea fan. (Got all the games except Disgaea 5).\nBTW you can use the PSP Cheat code to play ETNA MODE:  highlight "NEW GAME" and punch the code:\n>>>>  Triangle, Square, Circle, Triangle, Square, Circle, X <<<<\nMaybe they will fix the game... optimizing this thing and puting a resolution setting.\nGame on kiddos!","February 24","false","15.3"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","11"

I really wanted this port to be good, but this is shameful for a number of reasons.\n\n-The game runs horribly:\nMy PC has never had this much trouble running something even on the lowest settings. That dosen't say much considering the bare bones graphics options.  I like the idea of being able to swith between the new and old textures and interface but there needs a way to lower the overall reselution. One thing that did help the game run faster was disableing the v-sync which speed up the game tremedously (Still not enough though), however, it cause unbearable tears witch I make any -movemnt of the screen almost vomit inducing.\n\n-The controls are agravating with a keyboard and mouse.\nThe majoraty of the time I've spent playing so far has been attempting change button arangement so that in to something manageable.  I've had no success.  Using the asdw keys to move and select units is clunky and dosen't feel right given the games narually angled camera.  Using the mouse would have worked exept there is no way to adgust the camera except zomming. Also, while attempting to select units it always takes multiple clicks with the mouse before the game decides to actually select something.\nNote: (No PC user should ever have to use a controller if they don't want to.)\n\nDon't buy this game on PC unless they patch it to were it becomes functional.

Saying that the game does have its issues which put me on the edge of not recommending, however, the developers are quick to respond and react which even though the issues are excruciatingly annoying and troublesome, the game is worth it.\n\nFirst off, keyboard controls are absolute crap, hard to control, hard to manage, and is even worse if you try to replace the K and I keys by using L/R mouse buttons, just don't. The mouse seldom works at sending the responses. Second, the game becomes unplayable when the FPS drops randomly to a very low rate causing turns to take FOREVER. I can get by with the controls being absolute junk, but the FPS issue not so much, THANKFULLY they are actively working on that, and have voiced their sincerest apologies, and seem to be working hard to get it resolved.\n\nSo should you buy this game? Absolutely, especially if you never played a Disgaea game before. If you ever played Final Fantasy Tactics but wanted something newer and 10x better, get it, don't hesitate, they will fix the bugs.","February 29","true","21.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

NIS is aware of the issues and is working to fix them, so if you're unsure, check back in a week or so to see if a patch is out.\nUPDATE: A patch has bene released, and most people are reporting the game runs fine now. The controls are still PS2/PSP-era so keep that in mind.\n\nPersonally I've had no performance/visual issues. My specs might help you figure out if you'll have issues or not prior to the patch:\nOS: Windows 10\nCPU: i7 3.2 Ghz\nRAM: 12 GB\nGPU: AMD R9 270x\n\nMy only complaints otherwise with the porting are regarding the keyboard/mouse controls (mouse is really weird, use a gamepad) and how the buttons are labeled 1-2-3-4, etc instead of Square - Circle - X, or A B X Y, etc. There seems to also be errors regarding some unit queues (if a unit is queued to attack, but the target dies before their turn comes up, that unit no longer gets to attack), but that's a relatively minor issue.\n\nAs far as the GAME goes, this is my first time coming into contact with Disgaea, and I'm enjoying it.

(My settings are all new graphical features off except the new UI with Vsync on using a DS3 controller).\n\nThis is the first Disgaea game and probably my second favorite after Disgaea 4. The story is excellent, the main story (with some grinding of course, this is a japanese srpg after all) is crazy long (I think last time it was 80 ish hours for me on the PSP version), the characters are generally likable, there's a bunch of zaniness with random bouts of seriousness, and it's just generally very enjoyable if you like SRPGs (Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem) without requiring it to take itself too seriously.\n\nGranted, this is a PS2 game ported to the PSP and then finally ported to the PC. The main place this starts showing this age are the graphics, which look only slightly better upscaled and are otherwise unchanged (unless you choose to use new map textures). The other is the lack of class/combat/quality of life features in later disgaea entries. For instance there is no option to change text display to instant, many later classes are missing, you can't toss towers directly on to people you need to throw them next to people, etc. But those features (aside from the text display one) are mainly only going to be noticed as missing by someone who has been playing later entries into the series while the older graphics are probably going to be up to taste.\n\nThis game series has a history of INSANELY long post-game content. In addition to the usual alternate ending fair/NG+ (and Etna mode) there are also massive challenges that require a huge amount of grinding, reincarnating, grinding more, etc, etc to even accomplish. But if you're the kind of person that can handle it the content is there and it will eat a lot of time.\n\nI really like the entirety of the series and I hope that they also begin making their way over here (hopefully in their PSP/PS Vita versions with all DLC/extra content included in the base game) but for now this is a great first step into a giant, complicated, grindy, funny, and lovingly crafted series. I hope you decide to try it, dood.\n","February 25","true","24.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The updated graphics options are kind of a mess.  I had them on, but turned them off because it makes it difficult to play.  There are portions where the audio is glitched out and you cannot hear the characters talking as well, but that is a more minor problem because all the cutscenes are subtitled.  That's just my own minor issues.  There are others with more serious problems that I hope NIS addresses soon.\n\nOverall, I can still recommend it to fans of disgaea.

The storyline is extremely quirky and rediculous, definitely not something to be taken serious if you're coming from something like Final Fantasy. The gameplay is where the magic begins. It's a tactics based rpg in which you essentially keep leveling up. As far as I'm concerned, once you finish the main story line, the only real goal is to simply see how absurdly powerful you can get, which wouldn't seem like a very deep concept, but is somehow extremely addictive.\n\nThe level cap is 9,999. Yes, almost 10,000 levels. Not to mention, you can reincarnate whenever you want, further increasing your stats with every level up. For example, a level 200 character is typically pretty weak. If you say, level up to 5000 and then reincarnate and THEN level up to 200, you now have a hell of a character. You're also able to level your equipment, skills, and expertise with weapons. Virtually everything is able to be trained. You also have the ability to create characters, modify how strong/weak enemies are, how expensive/rare items are in the shops etc.\n\nUltimately, it's a fantastic game if you have the time to put in to it. Once you start hitting post game levels and manage to overcome the initial difficulty, you'll start powerleveling pretty fast and that's where things really get entertaining.\n\nDid I mention how disappointed I am that Pleinair isn't available? :'(","February 25","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game can be quite difficult as well -- which may be a positive or negative depending on your preference.

This is one of the few games I have played  that manages to be consistently funny even though the English tracks are not as good as the Japanese version (The English voice acting is decent, but the English translation is fairly weak.

Your entire computer that is.\n\nThe game is not quite as pretty as a modern game  and a lot of the features added to make it look pretty for PC don't really do the job well.\n\nThere are numerous bugs reported - I have yet to experience most of them, so buyer beware.\n\nWith all that said, if you have never played Disgaea you may want to wait until the bugs are straightened out.\n\nFor fans of the series, if you lost your copy over the years, pick it up! Or hell, even if you're not a fan and you love SRPGs, you should give it a go.\n\nI recommend this game though I do caution that it is not completely optimized.","February 26","true","80.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is overall very good(remember this series was never built on graphical ability, it was always made to be 2D sprites on minimal 3D maps and elements).\n\nMy only caveat would be that you can't skip text or speed up geo block destruction or cancel animations that I could find.

Also, when directing orientation of your skill, there is no support to aim it using the stick on a controller(main stick on xbox one controlller does nothing, have to use the regular up down etc...).\n\nWhile these aren't game breaking problems, I feel these should be adresse in a patch for the general enjoyement of players as when you're doing that item world map for the 1000th time, no animation skip or skill aiming can be frustrating,..\n\n","February 25","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't even get past the opening scenes due to horrible slow down. It takes 5 seconds plus just for a window to fade in then it has to fade out!\n\nEdit: If people think I'm being whiny about not getting 60 FPS, I don't care about 60 FPS. I was getting like 5-10 FPS. The opening scene talking about King Kercheisov (Spelling?) took 20 minutes to get through. I have one life, I'm not wasting it here....\n\nThe game itself is fantastic, so just go play the Playstion 2 version... Or heck, even the Nintendo DS version the without voice acting. That version is better than this one.\n\nBut on PC, the port is bad and they should feel bad. I had higher hopes since they said "It's not just a port!" in the Steam store. Seems like other people can run it just fine though, so... Buy at your own risk?\n\nIf the problems get fixed before I refund, I will change the review.

The game is now playable for most if not all systems, so get out there already and buy a copy dude! Shoutout to the devs listening to the community, this doesn't happen as much as it should! :D\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: Disgaea PC is what you would call... well, a port of a port. Disgaea is one of those timeless classics originally based on the ps2 system. The gameplay is awesome, the story is what you'd expect of a difinitive JSRPG, and the sprites look like they come out of a SRPG :P. Sadly, this little gem has a couple of bugs. No way to skip movies, slow graphics, and a terriblly ported control scheme. The DS port is better than this one, and I'm pretty sure it's cheaper too. I'm hoping they fix it up a little so it's worth playing :)","February 25","true","18.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

NISA are aware of the problem and are trying to fix the issues, but please be aware that until it is fixed, you may experience some issues. EDIT 06/03/2016 - NISA have released a number of patches that seemed to have fixed most of the issues. There may be a few remaining minor issues, but the major ones have been fixed.\n\nThe Good:\n\nIts Disgaea on PC! While the story is pretty basic, the writing is very self-aware. The main story will take about 20 - 30 hours to complete the first time around, but the meat of the game lies within the Item World and the bonus bosses. The Item World is a series of random maps that are used to strengthen items. As you progress through the Item World of your chosen item, it will gain levels equal to the number of floors you have cleared, which will improve its stats. Something to keep in mind: the more powerful the item, the stronger the enemies are.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nIts Disgaea 1 on PC! This is a port of the original Disgaea game, with the addons from the PSP port "Afternoon of Darkness", so the complaints are the same: Many bills in the Dark Assembly are locked until you reach a specific rank in the Dark Assembly. Some Item World maps can be unwinnable because the game creates sections of land too far apart. If you execute a series of actions, any unused actions cannot be undone (ie, if you attack an enemy with 5 characters and the third one kills that enemy, the last two characters will still be counted as having taken their action for that turn). Also keep in mind that when using a controller, the game will only offer prompts for generic buttons (ie Button 1 is accept, Button 2 is cancel)","February 25","true","16.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are a fan of games like Fire Emblem or Final Fantasy Tactics and can handle a few humorous anime tropes, I am sure you will feel right at home with this game.  However, I personally see it ( at this stage atleast) as a journey you are taking with a dev testing the waters on pc. The game right now, is having a few issues ( as of 2/26/2016) with things pertaining to performance and things of that nature. You aren't garunteed to have these issues but it is somewhat of a risk you are taking when purchasing the game.\n\n( I will give them credit, they appear to be actively working to solve the problems. Check their posts in the community hub for progress on that)\n\nI do, however, recommend you buy the game.

The controls are still PS2/PSP-era so keep that in mind.\n\nPersonally I've had no performance/visual issues. My specs might help you figure out if you'll have issues or not prior to the patch:\nOS: Windows 10\nCPU: i7 3.2 Ghz\nRAM: 12 GB\nGPU: AMD R9 270x\n\nMy only complaints otherwise with the porting are regarding the keyboard/mouse controls (mouse is really weird, use a gamepad) and how the buttons are labeled 1-2-3-4, etc instead of Square - Circle - X, or A B X Y, etc. There seems to also be errors regarding some unit queues (if a unit is queued to attack, but the target dies before their turn comes up, that unit no longer gets to attack), but that's a relatively minor issue.\n\nAs far as the GAME goes, this is my first time coming into contact with Disgaea, and I'm enjoying it.

It's just as i remember it and it is still my favorite game of the whole franchise. Mouse and keyboard work fine here but it seems to be slightly better with a remote. So many hours of fun to be had here, I highly reccomend this game!\n\nLeaving the part below in until I have gotten a good amount of hours in to see if they have solved this problem. So far so good!\n\nUpdate: I have been experiencing crashes latley, most recently after playing for 2 hours into the item world.......kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ now and pretty much lost interest as I would have to do all that work over again. I would say wait for the kinks to be worked out. I was literally 1 step away from the portal that would have led me back to base and i could have saved.","February 26","true","24.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Game plays and runs fine, I know a few people have rerported issues with it, but seems smooth and stable for me!\n\nIf you're looking to get your Disgaea or your Turn-Based Strategy RPG fix then look no further.  This series is the standard all others should follow.  Talk about HUGE time sink.  I've only just scratched the surface.  Looking forward to diving deep into the item world and creating those aweome game breaking weapons!  :D\n\n\nIf you're a fan of the series, or the genre then pick this up dood!  There's a lot of gaming to be hand for $20!","February 26","true","41.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was thrilled when I saw it was being released on Steam, as I adore the gameplay. It looks a bit dated when compared to todays graphics but the charm is still there.\n\nThe voice acting is great. The soundtrack really stands appart from other games and the storyline is a lot of fun. I love level griding in this game. It feels really rewarding creating characters that can annihilate the enemy characters in one move.\n\nIf you enjoy tactical RPGs and don't mind dated graphics then I recommend this game very much.","May 25","true","30.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

READ BEFORE BUYING!!!!\n\nFor people that are not familiar with this title, Disgaea is a Tactical JRPG taken it to the next level in craziness. Like all JRPG's, expect alot of grinding to get up to that point, but when all that is done your damage is true the roof. The main story isn't  Final fantasy rated but that isn't stopping the fans of the series like me to be very happy to see this title come to pc.\n\nSo? is this title for the casual gamer? absolutely not, don't even buy it. But for a no life gamer that wants to see how ridiculously far he can go with a game and wants to see big numbers popup when dealing damage, this may be the title your looking for. This is one of those games that requires an acquired taste for it, if your unsure just watch some youtube videos so you get to know the game first.","June 5","true","77.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
