I paid a little over $5 for this and I still feel ripped off. The background never changes and there is only one "enemy", it crawls in a straight line back and forth and it dies if you jump on its head. No unkillable enemies, enemies that chase you, anything to make it a little less boring. The backdrop also never changes but I didn't mind that much at all.\n\nThe real issue I have with the game though is the camera. It is perfectly fine for levels which fit fine on your screen, but my god when the levels get taller the scrolling is horrible. It seems like every vertical movement you make the camera adjusts, there were a good few levels where I couldn't even see the only hud there is, which lets you know if you can teleport or not. Also when you die and respawn the camera starts in the middle and quickly pans down to your character, so the first third of a second is spent without your camera focused on you. It is disorienting and made my experience very bad. Also the funniest part, there's a few areas where you have to drop from the top of the level to grab a key and when you hit the ground the camera doesn't pan all the way so you can't even see where you are landing. Absolute joke.\n\nI didn't like the teleport ability that much, it was very difficult to control. It seems you can only teleport up and to the side, might just be a personal gripe but I thought it felt awkward to use and preferred the normal platforming when I could.\n\nThe normal controls were solid though, with normal movement I felt very in control of my character which is probably the only reason I completed all 40 levels.\n\nI can't see justifying this purchase if the price is anything above $2.50, there simply isn't enough content to justify spending that much money. If you are really trying to beat the game quick you can have it done anywhere between 35 - 50 minutes if you are decent at platformers.","November 22, 2015","false","0.8"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","18","22","3","2"

The only main cause of concern is the original price (without discount) which seems a bit steep and the enviroment/backdrop which never changes. It gets a bit boring/bland after a while.\n\n> EDIT: There is controller support in game and it makes the game a lot more enjoyable for me as I'm used to controllers. I was thrown off because the menu does not allow use of controller. <\n\nThe game is basically get keys around the room and then make the way to the escape point. There are spikes and enemies and also intricate puzzles through the levels. There is also a teleporting technique which when you hit shift you teleport through walls.\n\nI would recommend it to people who love platforming games and those looking for a simple way to burn a few hours.\n\nI would not recommend it to people looking for a more advanced platforming game, achievements or people who are prone to being annoyed easily.\n\nIf you felt I missed something out please do watch the video as I have a hard time typing thoughts and reactions down into words.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions or advice. Thanks. :3 <3","November 21, 2015","true","0.4"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","19","25","2","0"

The aim is to collect all the keys then exit the door. You'll be avoiding spikes, and wandering enemies which you can jump on Mario-style. I knocked over the first 40 levels in 77 minutes, so this isn't a very long game. The author says he is working on a new chapter. I probably wouldn't pay full price for this, but I got it in an indie bundle, for which it is perfect. Looking forward to the new levels.","December 8, 2015","true","1.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Puzzle platformer.  40 levels, low difficulty.  Keyboard only. I wouldn't spend more than a buck on it but I enjoyed the ~45 minute it took me to beat it.  One problem with the port (other than being kb only) was that the indicator of being able to teleport or not was offscreen if the screen needed to scroll vertically.  This doesn't appear to happen in the actual mobile version.  Only an issue on the very last puzzle.","December 9, 2015","true","0.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NoahStolk/recommended/402980/","NoahStolk","Nosahasa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NoahStolk/","532 products in account","I got this game from a bundle long ago and decided to give it a try.\n\nThe first thing you see when starting up the game is a little menu where you can select the levels, I couldn't find any options or settings. There are 40 levels, that's it. I completed 24 out of 40 levels in less than half an hour, which means it shouldn't take longer than two hours to complete the whole game. For some reason I couldn't select level 25-40 in the main menu, seems to be a glitch.\n\nOnce you start playing the levels, you'll notice that the gameplay is really repetitive. Level design is limited, you just collect all keys and move to the door, where you will be thrown to the next level, without transition or anything. The view can also be pretty glitchy in some levels, which is disorienting and annoying.\n\nTwo obstacles can be found in the levels; spikes and a little red enemy. Spikes, obviously, don't do anything. You just avoid them. Enemies, honestly, don't do a lot either. They move left and right, and that's it. You can kill enemies by jumping on top of them, but you won't get rewards or anything other than getting them out of the way. There's nothing more that will hurt you, and that's the main reason for this game being repetitive and not challenging.\n\nIn the first few levels, some text boxes occasionally appear, telling you what to do. These texts contain quite some grammatical errors, which make it pretty unprofessional. I know English isn't everyone's first language (it isn't mine either), but developers should at least take the time to make sure everything is written correctly, or ask someone who is fluent in English to write it for them.\n\nThe game also gives you the ability to teleport, which is sort of unique, but it feels pretty random and odd. Sometimes you get teleported into an enemy or into spikes and you have to restart the level. In some areas you cannot teleport, and it seems that the reason for this is to prevent levels from being too easy, which, in my opinion, is just bad level design. It is also a little unclear when you can and when you cannot teleport. The idea about the teleport mechanism was good, but the poor implementation ruined it. Overall I found this feature annoying.\n\nAnother repetitive thing about the game is the music. There are two music tracks, one that plays during the levels (which is incredibly repetitive and started to get annoying after a while), and one that plays in the main menu. After I finished level 24 I suddenly found myself back in the menu, where both tracks would play at once for some reason. As I mentioned earlier I couldn't select the next levels.\n\nPros:\nGraphics are decent.\nPlayer movement is mostly okay. (Played with an Xbox 360 controller.)\nCons:\nThe gameplay is repetitive and simply not challenging.\nLevel design is poor.\nThere is only one enemy.\nTexts contain grammatical errors.\nThe view can be glitchy sometimes.\nThe music is repetitive and there are only two tracks.\nI couldn't select all levels for some reason.\nThe game is WAY too short for its current price. (€4,99)\nOsteya feels like it needs a lot of polishment and improvements and therefore I simply cannot recommend it, especially at this price.","March 28","false","0.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Some are pretty interesting, some annoying but there are a lot of almost empty ones which seems lazy. Level music overlaps with menu music on the level select screen. And what is worst of all in my opinion - steam page claims the game has cards but it doesn't, there is no such badge. We all know games with cards sells better and I guess that was the dev's plan. I was waiting with my thumbs down thinking maybe he is going to add cards later, but two month after the release it's still not present.\nFor smaller price and with cards I guess I could recommend this game, but now I don't.","December 26, 2015","false","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"
