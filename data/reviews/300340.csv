Impressive really.\nGenre: Parkour, Exploration, Puzzle\nPersonal Verdict: Excellent.\n\nReview Lets cut to the chase.\n\nLemma is a freeflowing parkour game in the style of Mirror's Edge which is the famed parkour game everyone probably have heard about. In any case Lemma is not a cheap copy of Mirror's Edge mechanic but it sports its own unique way of playing.\n\nTo start off with you don't traverse buildings nor skyrscraper in Lemma but rather a unique world that slowly through the acquisition of notes lying on the ground and through narrative told through the person helping you along the way, the unique world of Lemma is slowly reveal. The levels are minecraft style of blocky graphics although the characters are in full 3D.\n\nThe mechanics are simple, you run automatically by pressing forward and gaining momentum, space to jump and this couple with the momentum are essential to gaining grounds. In any case as you play the game more mechanics are unlock to help you with the levels that range from creating new grounds for you to use to a kick. Yes. A kick.\n\nThere are many objectives in the levels of Lemma although you will have to extract what is it you have to do based on your surroundings. You have to realize the levels in Lemma rapidly gain difficulty the further you go so you will have to quickly adapt or die.\n\nThere are a lot of ways for you to die btw. Despite being a 1 man team the dev manages to create a varied and interesting enough level for me to run through with but i do have to critize the later levels for being a little bit too complex and the objective vague for my taste. Things such as laser guided missiles, corrupted rom and exploding cubes are the least of your problems. The challenge for me is to try and get to a new level.\n\nIncluded with the game are the ability to make your own level and play though other user created level. A few of the levels I play are quite fun and challenging. I would recommend you to just stick with the challenge level that user created if you get stuck in the campaign.\n\nConclusion Would i recommend Lemma? Yes I would recommend Lemma a freeplay parkour where you traverse a strange and unknown world  as you follow cryptic hints as to what exactly is going on in it. The controls are tights, mechanics sounds and the level design cope well with the mechanics therefor I would give this game a recommendation. One of the better Indies game I suppose. Mechanically simple but gameplay wise hard to master.\n\nScoring Methology [Courtesy of Meat King]:\n-	S-Rank: excellent\n-	A-Rank: very good\n-	B-Rank: solid\n-	C-Rank: satisfactory\n-	D-Rank: inferior\n\nVerdict: A-Rank.\n\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

You discover a colleague named Mark via breakthroughs in the field of physics has disappeared into this same world known as Lemma. Now more curious then ever, Joan is ready to continue onward and unlock the secrets inside. Rest of the story slowly unfolding through text messages on your phone, occasional popups on-screen or mysterious notes left in levels.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLL8FS2igjY\nLemma is very impressive for a solo project. Does have similar art-style and gameplay to Mirrors Edge but a little rougher around the edges and far more focused on puzzles. With that said I really enjoyed the atmospheric soundtrack, intelligent level designs and fluid control system. The addition of being able to 'build your own path' using special moves like wall-slides and army-rolls was  wonderful but also added to the challenge of the previously mentioned puzzle design.\n\nMinimalistic by nature and with plenty of video settings, it should scale and perform well on a range of systems. As someone who suffers from motion sickness was a little concerned initially. Thankfully options like field of view sliders were included and I have no problems playing longer sessions whatsoever. Worth mentioning Oculus Rift is also supported but unfortunately I don't have the hardware required to test.\n\nIf you enjoy puzzle platformers, jump-maps, parkour driven gameplay and surreal worlds, it's well worth taking a look at Lemma. With leaderboards and level editor included it should keep the community alive for some time.  Not sure why this game isn't being talked about more as it deserves to be and I'm still looking for the downsides.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/recommended/300340/","TheIronicGamer","TheIronicGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/","1545 products in account","A very fun parkour/puzzle game with an intriguing story.\n\nLemma is your basic parkour game. It follows much of the same aspects as games such as mirrors edge. It carries out this parkour mechanic very well and fluidly. You can find yourself running across walls, jumping over ledges and walling jumping  to get to higher places in lemma. It does very little differently to other games in this respect.\n\nLater in the game however you do get access to an interesting new mechanic that changes up the gameplay slightly. As you slide across ledges or run across walls you create a blue area. This area can be used to carry the games electricity system, The mechanic is used to create thought provoking puzzles. You have to figure out exactly how to get to an area through parkour so you can continue the track of electric power. This aspect of the game created a rather fun way of combining puzzles and parkour together.\n\nOne thing about this game really suprised me. I wasn't expecting it to have a very good story, if even a story at all. However the game has a really interesting story. To put it simply it involves you talking to another person who is trapped in this world with you. My description doesn't do it much justice but there is much more to it than that. It involves a heavy amount of physics so if your into that then this is a good game for you.\n\nThe story is told through use of notes and a mobile phone system in which you chat via text to your friend. Usually I would hate the fact that the story is told via notes cause this usually means the developer has run out of interesting ideas to tell the story with. Although Lemma seems to somehow wipe this notion from me and tell the story incredibly well through notes. The telephone system also means you feel like your interacting with the other person.\n\nLemma contains plenty of stuff for the collectors out there. Each level contains multiple orbs and notes to find. They are hidden in increasingly difficult places making them a challenge to get to.\n\nPersonally I found one thing that really let the game down. The graphics aren't particularly great. Texture quality is not up to a very high standard throughout the majority of the game. The game also repeatedly uses the same textures throughout a level making it seem extremely repetitive and can get boring after a while. However the amazing lighting effects do counteract this issue greatly and can redeem the game of this very minor flaw.\n\nThe majority of the time I found the animations to be very fluent and look great. The grabbing, running and jumping animation of the arms looked great, when they worked. Although sometimes I did find myself grabbing onto nothing and kind of jumping about glitching a bit. This did kill the experience a little for me. But luckily this wasn't too common of an occurance. I was also very disappointed with the rolling and sliding animation. When doing these you completely use track of your character and your screen just spins without you knowing what is going on. This completely disorientates you and can make you end up falling off the world accidently.\n\nThe games options menu is about as complete as I would want it to be. It contains pretty much the full range of resolutions. There are seperate volume sliders for SFX volume and Music. There are a wide variety of graphics options available with options such as Ambient occlusion, Volumetric lighting, V-sync and a lot more all being present. The only thing it may be missing that it should probably have is anti-aliasing. There is also a full control menu with entirely rebindable keys present. The interface also is very uninspired presented in a see through black box but this is another minor flaw.\n\nOverall I felt this game to be a fantastic experience that should be played by anyone looking for a game with great parkour mechanics as well as a fantastic story.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system Don't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!","May 12, 2015","true","2.0"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","21","26","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/300340/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The notion of free-running is one that inspires wonder in the hearts of many. As our cities begin to reach for the clouds with concrete and steel, humanity’s collective desire to explore follows. Sadly, we are restrained from truly achieving this dream by the rather irritating force of gravity. Parkour and free-running offer a route for us to step upon where we openly avoid, a route that Lemma sprints down in its attempt to offer a worthwhile experience.\nAt its core, Lemma’s closest parallel is to be drawn with Mirror’s Edge. You play as a completely unarmed character in a strange and confusing world, one that seems to grow around you while trying to halt you in any way it can. As far as presentation goes, everything is seen from a first person perspective with Minecraft-esque blocks making up your playpen of an environment. As simple as this may be, there’s something altogether alluring about it.\nRain falls throughout Lemma just as frequently as the sun shines. Each of the numerous levels that you’re given free reign to run around is presented with its own particular feel and sound. While a very early zone, Jungle in particular showcases how beautiful everything can be with a few simple blocks and a lot of creative design ability. The visual presentation of Lemma does not particularly affect its gameplay.\nAs stated before, this is a first-person platformer. You run along, gaining momentum in preparation for a leap across whatever geological feature is in your way. There’s no run button or sprint mechanic in action throughout Lemma. The necessity of maintaining a consistent flow with your motion is something that’s rarely seen in gaming and yet, after seeing Lemma in action, a feature that really adds supplementary purpose to gameplay.\nIt isn’t all about simply running from platform to platform until you reach the big shining door at the end. Momentum plays a key part in Lemma when you begin busting out impressive wall-runs or gravity-defying leaps to make your way around the terrain. While it can take a little getting used to, Lemma’s most delightful aspect comes in the form of this very feature.\nThe environments around are just as enjoyable to play within, too. Flowing walls and walkways mix in with seemingly impossible to reach platforms as part of a recipe that creates something special. Completing a game is all well and good, but just being able to run around while simple motion itself makes you smile is enough to make Lemma worthwhile in some ways.\nThat being said, the worlds of Lemma do have a slightly bitter seed that doesn’t seem to blend with everything else. At times you’ll come across a dead end or challenge that seems initially to be completely impossible. They rarely are, you just can’t see what has to be done. No clues are dropped into this soup of geography though, and certain inconsistencies rear their heads when it comes to the mechanics that you can manipulate to push forward.\nYour only way to work out what exactly is going on in the world Lemma creates is through mobile phone messages that arrive when you reach certain signal points and multiple note piles scattered around. They weave a short but evocative tapestry, steeped in scientific intrigue but lacking in any emotional substance. It’s an interesting idea which almost gives Lemma something special in its narrative, falling short through a lack of personality indicative of text-based conversation.\nLemma’s sound design is nothing special at first listen, until you realize how easily it seeps into your ears like nectar dripping from the beak of a hummingbird. There’s a very indie feel to it, propelling the audio over and above almost any other games of this ilk.\nThe sad thing is that, on the whole, Lemma is far from a memorable experience. Make room for it on your hard drive and you’ll find an interesting experience that’ll make you smile. The moment you turn it off, though, there’s none of that itching desire to go back. It lacks that something, that mark of passion fundamentally stitched into all great indie games.\nIt is, however, good. A fun distraction which opens the door to a small star of happiness in a sky filled with many brighter celestial bodies. If Lemma were in a constellation, it would be one of those stars sat in the middle. Lemma shines just as bright as its contemporaries but doesn’t have that one special mark that makes it a game you have to buy.","August 26, 2015","true","7.4"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

You WILL lose track of where to go next several times.  There's a large open world but no system of objectives and little or no guidance whatsoever.  I got very frustrated even though I had already beaten the demo.\n-The protagonist (you) act like a jerk sometimes.  There's a phone where you receive a bare minimum of guidance for the first couple of levels, with a simple dialogue system with between one and three choices.  Typically the choices are either "I need help" or "♥♥♥♥ off, I don't need your help".\n-The parkour animations aren't very seamless.  Joan (you) can do things that shouldn't be possible and in the process often hauls herself up by empty air or shoves a hand into solid rock.  This happens so, so often.\n\nPros:\n-It's beautiful.  Skies, landscapes, textures, sounds, all of it.  Soundtrack is amazing - not the sort of thing that I'd listen to a lot myself, but it fits the game very well.  Sometimes it reminds me of Mirror's Edge soundtrack, sometimes Dear Esther.  The enemies go through three stages - unsettling when watching from afar, for which I applaud, then terrifying as they chase you, then boring and frustrating later on when you have five of them chasing you while you  just try to accomplish a task.\n-Puzzles are satisfying and puzzly.  Some of them are quite simple, but others are Myst-caliber.  The parkour is very fun.  I'm going to compare it to Mirror's Edge because it's a well known game that I've played extensively.  Lemma's parkour is technically inferior, I guess, but it's more fun because of the nonlinear nature of it, especially when you add on Joan's special abilites.  It's also more intuitive, less realistic (even discounting Joan's powers) and glitchier, although IMO not glitchy enough to be really frustrating.\n-The story and lore... Wow.  The story is compelling and ties into the lore well, which is very fleshed out.  Also, you can look back and see clues to some of the big reveals in the game.  The lore ties Joans' powers quite solidly into a layman's knowledge of quantum mechanics, and the whole alternate universe thing makes sense as long as you accept the basic premise and don't think too hard.\n\nOverall, 8/10 would recommend, would play again.\n\n","June 17, 2015","true","36.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

This game will have your hands sweating and your stomach queazy IF you have some fear from heights, but never fear for you cannot die in this world.  At times though this doesn't seem to help when you don't know how you are going to get to the next plateau, because dying is a way of thriving in this world.  You build these walls and platforms of energy ice that will aid you to get to further plateaus that are otherwise inaccessable.  You parkour; run, jump, climp, roll, and even build your way, your roads to other levels, other doorways, and other dimensions of Lemma... This game has excellent replay value, because you would never go about doing the same way twice, and you can go and explore at your own pace.  BUT CAUTION - laying too many walls of engery ice may impede you from completing a level or even your ending, as the last level had done for me.  There is no restart level, so you've got one shot to make it right.  Save often at the beginning of each level and do not over-ride those saves until you are sure that you have not screwed up.  [*Please note that I've personally have over 100 hours of gameplay at the end of the game, but am stuck on the last level, because I did just that and it's impossible to undo (destruction) all your previous construction!

Because knowing is half the battle!!!]   Other than that, and a bit of confusion of what or where you are in reference to exactly where you are to go next, with so many countless doors and open world, YOU ARE VIRTUALLY AN UNSTOPPABLE FORCE!

Imagine a not so pretty Mirror's Edge with more open environments, some puzzles and no fighting.\n\nThe graphics can at best be described as 'functional', the story-line is... honestly, I have really no idea what is going on... But, and this is the thing, it is actually quite fun to play. What is important, for a game like this, is that It is quite fluent and responsive. The few stunts available is easy to pull off (it just used left mouse button and the shift key). The worlds are voxel based, and are actually pretty in its own ways.\n\nThe USP is that as you go along, you will gain the ability to not only jump and climb around the environment, but to create your own platforms and walls to a limited extend, by performing certain stunt actions.  For example, if you start wall-running, you can run of the wall and it will continue to be built as you run of the wall. It creates a different way to look at the environment, as you are not only looking for the lines to climb and run, but also the possibility to create your own. The game play is basically to open and find the exit on each level. There are also hidden pickups (orbs and story-notes) hidden around in hard to reach places on some levels.\n\nBut the recommendation is tentative, it is a mixed bag. It plays very well, but the low production do show. It is pretty, as it goes,  but it is also very basic. The levels are sometimes very short, and the puzzles could have been better. There are also some enemies in some levels which moves at random, and they kill you in one shot, which can be very annoying. There are also levels with some time pressure, as it is crumbling away around you.\n\nHaving said all that, the game is as it is actually quite good, and I would recommend. It is atmospheric, and most levels  do let you take your time and explore at your own leisure. I am currently enjoying it, and if you are looking for different gaming different experience, it is worth taking a punt on.\n\nTrailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ox5cwNVqtQ\nHome page: http://lemmagame.com/\nOn Itch.io: http://et1337.itch.io/lemma","December 14, 2015","true","4.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Rather watch than read? Check out the video here:\n\nhttps://co60.ca/u/1H\n\nLemma Review\nIt seems like it’s been ages since we were last gifted with a game featuring a female free-running hero at the helm, with Mirror’s Edge release occurring over five years ago and its sequel currently only existing as a tease. Luckily for us lone developer Evan Todd took it upon himself to craft a parkour adventure of impressive scale and quality to say the least. Enter Lemma, the 5 year development project taken on almost entirely single-handedly that was entirely worth the effort.\n\nYou awake to little explanation for your strange environment or what brought you there. Gradually a backstory is revealed while you’re busy scaling the floating monoliths that overwhelm your surroundings. Signal towers act as beacons that are used to communicate via SMS with a mysterious character named Mark, someone your character has an apparent history with. He informs you that your name is Joan and that you’ve been trapped in Lemma, a world built in a computer simulation for an unknown experiment. A group of your friends are in the outside world trying to rescue you, but in the meantime it’s up to you and your parkour abilities to attempt to find an escape. Though your companion on the other end of the phone is your only help through the void, it seems you’re not even sure who he really is, what his true intentions are, or even if he’s the one you’re consistently communicating with. Discovering hidden notes in hard to reach locations reveals some of the game’s philosophy on abnormal physical properties and provides a healthy narrative backbone. It all works on a cognitive level and it gels with the gameplay effectively; theories and ideas on the true nature of matter and observation fit well into game of hovering indiscernible matter in endless space. The level of mystery brought about by the way the story is presented to you is intriguing enough to motivate deep exploration, and players who do so are rewarded with a greater understanding for this narrative through the scattered pages.\n\nThe world of Lemma offers a great feel of segmented openness. Players are free to explore open-ended puzzles and terrain that’s connected by more linear sections. Challenges are presented uniquely and with no explanation, an aspect that promotes discovery and that great sense of enlightenment upon success. While some concepts might be more apparent than others, there’s a problem with it not always being clear what you just did in order to complete a puzzle. The game sometimes becomes a victim of one button performing too many actions and the unintended outcome happening more often than you’d expect. Despite this, the control still feels extremely smooth and natural. At first running may feel a bit janky with arms being thrust with force in front of you, but this feeling quickly vanishes, and it feels as though you’re actually free running amongst the impossible shapes. Eventually players gain the ability to create their own floors and walls to branch out past existing architecture with rolls and wall-runs, adding a fluid extension to the parkour that we’ve never seen before in a first-person platformer. At first this seems like an element that can be easily exploited, but thanks to thoughtful level design there’s never really a situation in which the player can cheat the game. Instead it’s confidently designed around your understanding of how to use it properly. New elements are introduced later on as well; just as you think you’ve seen everything in the way of puzzle mechanics the game brings about new player abilities and environmental pieces. Later in the story you earn a skill to visualise blocks to wall run on out of thin air, giving your free running a new level freedom. Those who master handling the controls will be able to pull of some of the craziest platforming moves imaginable. A decent amount of challenge is given by hostile blocks and textures that hunt you down. These situations can get tense and lead to fun chases and escapes, but unfortunately are watered down by the reality of unlimited retries and object permanence upon respawn.\n\nFor an independent development and the money asked of the consumer the visual and subtle audio presentation is fantastic. Textures are simple yet have a fine look upon closer inspection, and the intentional overuse of cubic shapes to construct the majority of the world really cooperates well with the gameplay. The use of music is sparse and tastefully added to extraordinary situations. It’s clear that a ton of care went into how you take in each new aspect as you encounter them from your first person perspective, and the inclusion of Oculus support goes even further to demonstrate that. Unfortunately we lacked the equipment to experiment with this addition, but we can only imagine the level of intensity it would add. Climbing obstacles that are only half obstructing your path can sometimes induce some obtuse animations, but otherwise the game is truly an immersive experience.\n\nWithout a doubt the release of this game is an achievement in indie creative skill and credibility. It’s unquestionably on par with the AAA competition that it took such wise inspiration from. Lemma is a certain type of limbo that we wouldn’t mind getting lost in.\nSCORE: 8.8\n","June 28, 2015","true","7.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In contrast to Mirror's Edge, Lemma is alot more puzzle-based and not a whole lot of running. There's no fighting at all, just parkour and puzzle solving.\nLemma's puzzles are not about how to get from point A to point B. The game has a unique gameplay feature where you as the player can create blocks by rolling/sliding off a cliff, or starting a wall-run on a solid wall and then off into nothingness. You use these blocks to complete circuts, connecting two "wires" together to for example open a door or blow up a wall.\n\nIf you're looking for good parkour-only games, then Lemma is for you without a doubt. After milking Mirror's Edge to death,  I found this game to milk instead.

But this is a solid effort and I really want to try it in Oculus Rift. 9/10","May 16, 2015","true","3.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

The story is obtuse and forces you to hunt for hidden notes if you want even a chance of comprehending it, the level design becomes far too open-ended towards the end, making it very difficult to figure out how to progress, and this can cause a lot of frustration.  I ended up stuck, and gave up after much backtracking and getting lost.  Optional objective markers would be a godsend.\n\nHowever, the mechanics are sublime.  As a big fan of Mirror's Edge, this game struck all the right notes with me.  It takes the mechanics of wallrunning and sliding, and extends them to create walls and floors that form under you as you move.  It's incredibly rewarding to navigate the world, and it creates an excellent sense of flow.  Lemma is definitely worth a look.","September 6, 2015","true","6.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

Anything you wish to do in the game can be accomplished by hitting a key or two and looking towards your goal (which is especially handy considering Lemma features Oculus Rift VR support). Want to climb an object, slide across a wall, or even create one? Just hold the Shift key on your keyboard. Want to slide, roll, or perform a jump kick? Just click the Left Mouse Button.\n\nPlayers can look at almost any point in the world and reach it if they try. The fact that you’re not told to go there, or compelled by some external force (such as the promise of gold or XP), is exciting in a time where exploration in games is defined by its tedium. Go here, do that, get a small amount of compensation and a pat on the back…In Lemma, exploration is its own reward. You can go from running through humid bogs to clambering snowy pillars in moments by choosing YOUR route through the game’s humongous environments...\n\nYou can find my full review  here[videogamesandthebible.com], and a Let's Play of the game below!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5NxaWAMHzs","June 11, 2015","true","11.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

When it clicks, it matches the exhilaration of your parkour game standards. However, some poor and confusing level design saps the fun out of the traversal. Most of Lemma is figuring out what the game is asking you to do or where to go, That's not especially fun.\n\nThe parkour feels great and natural for the most part, but is maybe a bit lenient? It's a weird thing to complain about, but there were times when the best course of action was to just continually feather the left trigger. Partway through the game, you gain an ability that lets you spawn 'phantom' objects in the environment. This ability felt quite extraneous and is never consistent enough to be used strategically. What you can do is just spam left and right triggers and the ability will push you up in the air constantly to the point where any movement around the levels is trivial. It's the type of addition that's rarely useful in the puzzle solving and almost feels detrimental to the core gameplay.\n\nA couple of times over the duration of Lemma, you're chucked into semi-open areas and basically left to your own devices. It's never really clear what general direction you're meant to be heading in. You'd think a parkour game that just let you explore the world would be fantastic but it just feels aimless and frustrating. Given that the game occasionally explicitly points you at where you need to be going with waypoints, it feels haphazard and inconsistent,\n\nGraphically, it's perfectly fine. The developers get a lot of mileage out of its 'voxel' aesthetic and I think it works well enough. The sound design and music are solid and help the game's alien atmosphere.\n\nI'm quite divided on the inclusion of enemies. I think their abstract design is great but they're not all that fun to manoeuvre around and just recall similar frustrations in other parkour platforming games.\n\nI didn't find the story particularly engaging. That said, I didn't find all of the notes so maybe it takes on more meaning with additional contet. When the game asked me to make a moral decision, it never really felt earned or all that important and I kind of just did whatever. Then the game ended and I felt pretty unsatisfied.\n\nThere's a solid base in Lemma, it just feels so overwhelmingly unpolished and unfocused that I find it hard to recommend at $15. Maybe on sale if you're into parkour?","January 9","false","4.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

With one caveat though: Most of the ones I enjoy are in first person and feature some form of exploration in them. I greatly enjoyed games like Antichamber, Quantum Conundrum, A Story About My Uncle, Qbeh-1 and obviously the progenitors of this new wave of first person puzzlers, the Portal series. So it’s not surprising that Lemma immediately caught my eye.\n\nAside from this aspect, Lemma obviously takes a lot of inspiration from other games as well. Mirror’s Edge popularized it many years ago, and parkour has firmly established itself as a core mechanic that many games nowadays employ. An obvious influence to the aesthetic aspect of Lemma comes from Minecraft. Voxel graphics are showcased in plenty of titles, though Lemma manages to set itself apart by using realistic stone textures instead of stylized materials. This manages to invoke a certain cognitive dissonance in the player, since we know rock formations don’t adhere to these geometric rules. It’s almost like the world tries to convince you that it’s a real place.\n\nAnd that’s really the crux of the matter. Early on we get to know that we’re actually in an entirely different dimension. However it’s not immediately clear if it’s a real place or just a virtual construct. To solve the mysteries of this world, we can find a bunch of documents distributed across the levels. In addition to that, we also have a mobile phone through which our protagonists communicates with a friend of hers who is ostensibly responsible for bringing us here. This is where the game reveals that it dabbles in quantum physics.\n\nNow I’m not smart enough to make qualified assessments about how accurately the game portrays its subject matter. But I do know that not many game designers willingly try to present their players with concepts that a large part of the audience is bound to not understand. And that’s where Lemma earns my respect. We need more games that challenge us intellectually because only through this kind of experimentation are we able to broaden our horizons.\n\nDuring our travels through the cubic dreamscapes we’re confronted with a series of problems. A lot of the time, the floating pieces of rock are too far apart to simply jump from one to the next. In other cases, tiles in floors and walls are missing, preventing power to get from a generator to a corresponding object that needs to be powered.\n\nSince we’re in a different dimension, we’re granted a power that lets us overcome these obstacles. In Lemma's case, we are able to create walls and floors by interacting with the world around us. Doing a roll or sliding along the ground will make a floor appear next to a piece of ground that we’re sliding off of. Running along a wall or a column will instantly create a wall for you to continue running on. It incorporates gameplay directly into level design in a way few games have before. And it truly tests the creativity of the player to get form one point to the next.\n\nOne thing that might surprise people is the fact that Lemma’s world is inhabited by creatures that aren’t too happy about us wandering about the place. These enemies are all constructed out of cubes as well and if you happen to attract their attention – which you invariable will – they’ll relentlessly chase you through the levels.\n\nThe presence of these enemies is really the only negative aspect I could find here. Mostly because they’re constantly on the move and there don’t seem to be any patterns to predict their behavior and movements. This can often lead to a lot of frustration when you’re trying to come up with a way to traverse a particularly difficult section and also happen to be chased by exploding enemies who further destroy the level, making it even harder for you in your next attempt.\n\nLemma is the result of five years of hard work by a single person, which is somewhat noticeable. There is a certain lack of polish in some spots. The parkour mechanic for example includes very big tolerances that take away from the challenge a bit. Character movement also isn’t as fluid as you might have grown accustomed to from other first person games.\n\nNevertheless, I can wholeheartedly recommend Lemma to fans of first person puzzlers. It’s rare to see a game that offers so much freedom to players with the ways they can solve the problems they’re presented with.","June 7, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphics are subpar. The enemies are frustrating and poorly designed. The story is confusing, it's "moral dilemma" feels tacked-on. The levels are even more confusing than the story, and many just feel like the designer just went ham with the sphere brush in the level editor. Speaking of the level editor, it's terrible. None of the keybinds make sense. But the thing that really sealed the deal for me was the fact that THERE IS NO UNDO BUTTON. and because of the way the editor is laid out, it's entirely possible to delete a massive, complex portion of the level with a single, stray keystroke. There is literally no way to get it back, unless you're hitting save before every single keystroke.\n\nI think that this is a great concept for a game mechanic, but the game surrounding that mechanic is bad. It definitely has a future if it gets turned into a full-sized game centered around that mechanic, much like Valve did with Portal.

But is it any different or even possibly better?  Let's find out in the Lemma First Impression Review.\n\nLet's identify what Lemma is and what it sets out to do.  It is a first person parkour game with mystery and exploration in a surreal world.  You start off in this strange floating platform world in the sky not knowing who your character is, where you are, or why you are there.  It's a total mystery and that's the best part.\n\nThe game is developed entirely by one person, Evan Todd, and he was kind enough to provide a review code for this game.  I had a chance to play it for a few hours, and I can definitely tell you about the gameplay and whether it's worth your time.\n\nAs you begin traversing you'll pickup notes which seem very esoteric, but gives clues to the world you're in.  You'll also pickup a phone and begin communicating with a mystery man that you have some sort of vague relationship with.  You jump with the right trigger, grab with the left trigger, and roll or slide with the left thumbstick clicking in.  The world seems daunting at first as platformers are slim and far apart, but you will quickly realize just how intuitive the game is.\n\nThe game teaches you without putting you through a tutorial specific mission.  Controls are actually very easy to pickup and have varying degrees within their techniques.  You quickly find yourself utilizing the moves you learn to reach new areas.  And you begin to make your own conclusions on how to solve puzzles.  It does a good job of introducing you to a new concept and then challenging you with a much harder to solve situation.  That's video game basics, and surprisingly this game excels  where a lot of games fail.\n\nThe game also has some innovation as you can spawn platforms and challenge elements exclusively with your steps.  You can wall run and extend a wall.  Slide and extend a floor.  Or solve puzzles by stepping on an illuminated surface.\n\nThe world design and art style of Lemma is also surprisingly good.  A lot of the world is built with Voxel graphics, those chunky 3D pixels and it adds to the game's mystique.  The world is truly huge as you can look out at platforms far away and even look into the vanishing point.  Everything from the ambient music to the large spaces conveys how the game is really an isolated and unknown world.\n\nEverything about the game is very subtle.  The way you learn the moves, the puzzles presented to you, and the revelation of the story.  Even the graphic effects look nice, but there's no crazy eye candy.  The game has slow but very balanced pacing in every way possible.\n\nLemma is very polished for an indie game.  As I've stated many times, everything is intuitive and unfolds naturally.  The game looks very attractive and it feels very natural to move through this artificial world.  It even has oculus rift support which could be very immersive for those oculus early adopters.\n\nMy only complaint is that I wish there were voice acting for the sections where you read notes or text message on your phone.  Arguably this could be a game design choice to make the character feel even more isolated.  The game can also be a little slow, it's definitely not an action combat game.  It's exploration, mystery, and parkour movement.\n\nI can highly recommend Lemma if you are interested in an exploration and mystery game with intuitive movement.  The game sets out to accomplish a unique design and it is successful. If you don't have patience for a slower game, you may want to look elsewhere.

It got to a point near the end where the game would not even give me the slightest hint of where to go next, and I climbed around several levels are over two hours. I want to give a positive review, but it was so frustratingly difficult to find the ending that I refuse to play it again, or recommend it. The game has a lot of good mechanics, and it is pretty, but in the end it left me angry and unwilling to complete it. I have no desire to return to the game.\n\nThe only way I can see someone beating this game is to stumble blindly into the ending. I played completely through both Dark Souls games and managed to find my way through fine, despite it's lack of direction. The fact this game is harder to follow, is unbelievable.","July 6, 2015","false","7.2"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","44","11","25","5","0"

All the fun free running / climing action of mirrors edge, with no wonky action combat mechanics bringing the fun to a crawl.\n\nFun enough game until it starts throwing unweildly mechanics at you after about two hours or so. The etherial platform summoning ability that you have to use is both unreliable and just not fun. It does nothing but detract from what would be amazing gameplay.\n\nThe ability to create walls by wall running and platforms by sliding / rolling seemed broken enough by how trivial it made traversing the game, although I did enjoy the mechanic of using those created platforms and walls to conduct the energy streams. This mechanic wasn't utilized enough personally. It's used in earnest for about four levels then is relegated to just filling small holes to continue the energies progress. Why even bother?\n\nThe story is fun, if you bother to collect all the notes (which I did), but is not unreasonable to think that it is missable entirely.\n\nOn a positive note, almost all the enemies in the game are terrifying. This is due mostly to sound design, which is great. I had a general fear of dread around the enemies that I was aware of, and jumped out of my skin around the enemies that I was unaware of when they made their presence known.","May 18, 2015","false","8.0"," 10 of 27 people (37%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","37","10","27","0","0"

I also experienced multiple invisible wall cases, which made these situations worse.\n\nAll dialog; tutorial, story, background story are text. For as small of a team this game was developed with that’s understandable, but a (good) dialog audio would make this magnitudes better.\n\nWith some additional polishment this could be a great game. As it is, I’m a bit split.\nThe developer did a great job, and even open-sourced the game on release, added a level editor etc. The gameplay also feels very solid and fun. But the game just needed that bit of additional polishment. Given the game was just release, hopefully this polishment will be done in the coming weeks/months, potentially making this an indie gem.\n\n\n------\n\nI went into more detail in a forum post, so if you want to know about the specific issues I had:\n\nGreat potential, needs some polish, some bugs\nThis game has great potential, is a lot of fun, but I got a little bit frustrated with inconsistencies and getting stuck.\n\nIn the tutorial, the grabbing edges while in the air was explained too late. I already had to figure it out earlier, where I got stuck otherwise.\n\nAt one instance, I went for an area I supposedly was not supposed to. I jumped on stone, but fell right through it. The object does not have a collision box. This makes it very confusing, as I tried multiple times to reach it. In the end I had to turn around, and go another way upwards, which was not obvious enough though, as the other place seemed in reach and to continue as well.\n\nIn a later stage, with the laser-defense-thing, I actually went for the wall that would lower later on first. There is an invisible wall in the water to the left of it, no matter if the wall is lowered or not.\n\nFollowing that, I took a very long time to get past that tree like structure, with an exit inside its top, facing where you enter that area. I did not see this before-hand, and so, climbed the pillars to the backside of it. I then tried to get onto it, which I managed to do, but controlling the character seemed untested/unwanted there. I also did not see/find the exit, as I simply climbed to the top, and then - confused - went back. I then tried to reach the outer ring area, and again hit invisible walls, where I would have otherwise reached the solid ground.\nI eventually found the exit, but I believe there should have been clearer (visual) leads to the exit.\n\nI understand why the game has no audio dialog, but (good) dialog would certainly make it a lot better.\n\nI think the main menu also needs some more polish, as well as the challenge mode UI.\n\nThanks for the game, and especially for releasing source code and an editor!\nI hope (some of) these issues can be fixed, so I can recommend this game to others without reservation.","May 23, 2015","false","2.3"," 4 of 18 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","4","18","0","0"

It took me a entire ♥♥♥♥ing night to finish the blue guy and I didn't know wtf I was gonna do after that! So I backtracked and you can go EXTREMELY far back in the game.
