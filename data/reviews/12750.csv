"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TommySnare/recommended/12750/","TommySnare","TommySnare","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TommySnare/","227 products in account","I've played this game for nearly 6 years (my Steam hour count would tell you different). I used to own the CD version which never used steam, I've put MUCH more hours than a measly 40+into this game. So, I finally decided I should write a review about one of my most beloved racing games in gaming ever.\n\nI love this game, it is no secret to my friends, family and probably my neighbours (the outragous roars from car engines and crashes most likely shake the walls). I've always wanted more and more people to try and play this game, my passion. I have a long term passion for ANYTHING motorsport, be this Moto GP, BTCC, Formula 1 and all the way up to prestigious Le mans 24. Race Driver: GRID manages to capture a real genuine feel of BEING a REAL race driver in a REAL team, after you have finished a few races you are able to set up a team. Later on, bring in a team mate (fair few to choose from each having different discipline specialities and stats). You can create a livery (albeit from a rather limited customization level) and obviously, give your team a name. Within races you will have a team engineer talk to you from time to time to update you on damage to the car or, whether an opponent has spun and who is leading the race. Your team mate ALSO makes communication with you but, this is primarily used to tell you where he is on track. All of this combined along with having a personalized garage of cars allows for complete immersion (for me atleast) into the world of 4 wheeled motosport.\n\nThe career being the main SP experience of the game is split up into 3 different categories: USA, EUROPE and JAPAN. The USA focuses more on Street type tracks, Muscle cars and GT1-2 spec cars. EUROPE is focused on Tourers, open wheel and endurance type races. These mostly play out on race tracks such as SPA, Jarama, Germany's famous Nurburgring and Donington Park. Japan goes the route of drifting, Touge and Tuners. Tuners being beefed up Nissan Skylines and Honda NSX's (My favourite tuner). There is also a GLOBAL catagory that unlocks once the player has reached 10,000,000 REP points (this combines all regions 3 into one). You have a liscense for EACH of these locales that levels up as you complete races and earn REP (XP). One you select an event or race, you can select your difficulty, assists and what-not. Turning all the assists off and boosting the difficulty can boost REP dramatically.\n\nThis career mode is also split by seasons (there is no obvious prgress through a season) but, it seems to consist of 5-10 finished races per time. These are unlimited and are used to promote the played with entering a 24 Hour Le mans race, either as a hired driver for another team or allowing the player to enter his/her own team. This race is 20 minutes (realtime) and transitions to night time then back throughout, with some big money payouts it's hard to say no a lot of the times. This event CAN be skipped whenever the offer arises the player is never forced to enter the Le mans race.\n\nOutside of the main team progession there is also an option called 'driver offers' this takes you to a screen that randomizes 3 events for the player to choose from. You wll be racing for other teams whilst also using the car listed on the event. You will have certain objectives to complete and the payouts are much higher sometimes.\n\nNow, lets talk about gameplay, that IS what you are here for right? Let me make it clear to you that this is NOT A SIMULATOR, sure each car has it's own behaviour and feel but, Codemasters have found the perfect balance between real and arcade. Sometimes the cars can feel floaty but, that's usually fixed if using a wheel with some decent forcefeed back. Each discipline does feel almost completley different from one another, Formula 3's for example really need to be tamed with decent accelerator control. I recomend playing with a wheel, manual gears, ALL assists off and blast a Formula 3 around Okutama (Grand Circuit). GRID manages to capture the intensity of speed insanely well, the amount of times I have skipped a heart beat whilst driving GT2's, Prototypes and Formula 3's are un-countable; it's incredible. The vehicular damage in the game has some of the more accurate damage in gaming. You smash your front left of a wall and you will feel it. do something to your engine you'll know about it but, there is much more than just these two examples that can happen. Endless possibilities for damage.\n\nThis game is just genuinly FUN and fluid to play. It is one of the more simpler racing games to play, it's not complicated, there's no rule book, the AI is genuinly decent and very aggressive and it's completly immersive with amazing engine and ambient sounds. The game visually still holds up but, it does have a rather odd spepia like filter over it, there is a MOD availible called the 'Dargos Mod'. Not hard to find, it makes the game look crystal clear by removing the sepia and adding some beautiful colour.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read my review, I'm sure by now you have come to the conclusion that I just love this game. If you have any questions about the game please, give me a bell.\n\n10/10.","June 16, 2014","true","51.7"," 250 of 259 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","250","259","0","19"

If you are looking for an above average, arcade-simulation racing game at a budget price, look no further than GRID.\n\nPros:Despite being a 2008 title, the graphics have held up incredibly well for being 7 years old (with the added benefit of many of today’s low-spec PCs able to run it).\nExtremely detailed damage visuals.\nEngaging career mode with a modest yet sufficient number of tracks.\nVery responsive AI, which is arguably better than many of today’s racing titles.  AI difficulty level can be set for each individual race.\nUnique race types, such as drifting races (though these can be challenging).\nGreat value for the money.  Even if you only play 5-10 hours, it still provides more entertainment than a 90-minute movie ticket.\nCons:Limited number of cars - but the cars which are included are fan-favorites.\nUnrealistic, yet manageable handling.  Almost all the vehicles handle like American muscle cars, and prone to rear tire skidding.  My guess is that the developers tried to develop a physics model somewhere between pure arcade and full simulation.\nNon-functional multiplayer.  The official MP servers are dead.  There are some 3rd party unofficial servers which are active, but I haven’t used these.\nLack of Steam achievements.\nOverall, if you are in the mood for doing some racing, and don’t mind a somewhat arcade-like racer, I would highly recommend this game.  Similar games include Need for Speed and Burnout Paradise, but GRID is probably the superior one of the lot.","September 14, 2015","true","44.2"," 58 of 64 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","58","64","3","0"

It's hard to sum up the satisfying feeling of scoring first place on the last stretch, or of beating your previous time on the track by precious seconds, or of spinning out and causing a pileup of every car in the race. Events are varied enough that no two are the same, and between frustrating Japanese drift contests, superfast F1 races, grueling 24 hour events and deadly demoliton derbies, there's bound to be something enjoyable. Car selection is limited, with some events only using one car type, but the garage is large enough to be satisfying. After completing several challenges and forming your own team, you can chose your number, team colors, car patterns, and sponsors, all of which are extremely in-depth. Buy the game, it's worth it.","November 25, 2013","true","30.6"," 63 of 72 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","63","72","0","0"

So this game has a nice balance between realism and arcade, that is what makes this game is enjoyable and fun for casual gamers and racing enthusiast alike. This game also welcomed newbie or pro racing gamer. For newbie you can turn on all the driving assist in the game so the driving will be more simple and easy to learn, or if you feel like racing game is your everyday life you can turn off all the driving assist for more complex driving and customize the driving options so the car will perform like what you expect.\n\nAs for the graphics, although this is an old game (realeased in 2007) the graphics of this game is still feel good and comparable to current game graphics. The best thing about the graphics is the car crash effect, it looks so realistic !! see it for yourself here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH2KUrNow7s\n\nBut for me, the best thing about this game is that all race events in the game are based on actual official racing event, from the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans to the brutal American Demolition Derby (so don't expect any ilegal street racing in this game!  ).","November 22, 2014","true","31.6"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","38","41","2","0"

It's graphics considering it's got several years on it already are still really good looking. The handling model can be adjusted to fit a simulator or arcade style of racing which I like. You can make the game easy or hard. The damage model in the game is one of the better ones around as well. Crash into a wall you can knock off some fenders or something or you can bend your wheels and your car will pull to one side or another. You can critically damage your car or keep it clean if you are a good driver.\n\nThe physics model in the game is also very solid. The fact you can get hit, spun, flip and it all feels very weighted and normal is amazing. You can hit a lump in the grass while sliding sideways and start flipping and it seems real (my record for flips is like 14 if you are wondering haha) It's a truly fun game. My only complaint is because it is an older game the online servers are down (as far as my knowledge they are) But overall for a single player racing game if you can catch this one on a good buy you will not regret it.\n\nI would give this game a 95/100 for single player use only.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/12750/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1777 products in account","Grid is difficult. Exceptionally difficult. Even for a seasoned racing gamer such as myself. Needless to say, you will need some time to adjust to the challenge. Motion blurring is set to default, and I am still unsure what makes the game look better or more realistic. I have personally turned it off. GRID's general visual appearance seems to be hazy to begin with (from dust, smoke, etc), and this cannot be changed. Winning races or achieving podium finishes is desirable, but not mandatory, as you will still earn money for yourself and the team. The replay/flashback system works well and allows you to correct some of your driving mistakes per race. Personalizing your cars' colors, numbers, and patterns is limited but very nice. Sponsor decals placement is also fun and interesting to look at, as real brands are used. Unfortunately, you cannot upgrade your car parts. All you are allowed to do is purchase and sell cars, new or used. Some cars handle horribly, even if they are very expensive. GRID has some voice acting, and all I have heard was excellent. Depending on the person's origin, even their accent will be different and localized. Your team's employee and teammate will often relay important and informative radio messages to you. Damage received from driving is of great detail for all cars participating in the race. The damage incurred to the tracks are also vivid and lively, including tires, barricades, and railings. Even if you cannot get a podium finish at any race, you are allowed to retry it any time, for as many times as you would like. Although GRID is supposed to be more arcade style than a simulation, the way the cars and tracks feel surpass my expectations greatly. All competitions are challenging, requiring much effort from the player in order to win. As you go higher up the license levels, the difficulty becomes even more strenuous, if that was even possible. The difficulty makes the game so frustrating, that you will not bare to play for more than about two hours at a time. Because of the steep difficulty, winning gives you the experience of true accomplishment. Skill developing in this game is masterful and rewarding. Every single race is tense and exciting, every single time you try. There is a limited amount of tracks with alternative routes, but racing in them never gets boring. The rivalries you will develop between other drivers is a lot of fun. Scouting for and hiring teammates is also extremely interesting. If you hire a highly skilled teammate, he will be your biggest rival and toughest opponent in most races. Sometimes, your teammates become real nuisances, as they bang, scrape, and tip your car off the track. The Drift races are my absolute favorites. They are extremely fun, and are full of non-stop action at every turn. The game seems to have crashing issues during saving times and quitting times. As far as the starting grid goes, it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. There are no qualification steps at all, and it seems that the starting grid is determined at random, which makes it rather silly, unrealistic, and as if you were excluded from a part of the competition. The career mode is somewhat incomplete if you expect GRID to be a total simulation. There are truly no means of securing your own earned starting grid position, nor are you able to tweak your cars. Once you win all events, become the number one driver in the world, and your team becomes the number one team in the world, the game presents you with a prestige opportunity to race against a famous driver from a famous team. This particular race is one-on-one and the difficulty setting is adjusted to Extreme and you are only allowed to flashback one single time. This makes the race close to impossible. The cars, tracks, physics, effects, sounds, and environments are beautiful. There is a lot of excitement and fun to be had with GRID. In the end, this is one of the most frustrating games I have ever played in terms of difficulty. The lack of preliminary race steps, qualification laps, vehicle tweaking, and customization leaves a lot of detail to be desired. There is a lot to love in GRID, but there is also enough frustration.\n\nGRID is great.","March 20, 2014","true","31.1"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","28","31","0","0"

It's an arcade game, not a simulator.  The XBOX360 controller worked well with no configuration needed.\n\nThe game revolves around The 24 Hours of Le Mans,   During career mode -- where I had to run Le Mans 21 times before completing the game -- the 24 hours are compressed into 12 minutes.  I love the day & night transitions.\n\nGrid is not that serious of a game, however.  Alongside fictional circuit courses there are also various drift events and even downhill, nighttime, canyon races against traffic.\n\nThe AI does have a catchup element, but I didn't even notice it until the last few hours of the game.\n\nThere is a good selection of cars.  Most cars handle quite differently than each other.\n\nA big complement is that the AI occasionally makes big errors.  That is a realistic feature that is missing from many games.\n\nAt normal settings, your car can take quite a beating, There are hard difficulty levels, but I'd say the base difficulty is good for casual gamers, assuming you do use the driver assists.  Personally, since they do use traction control at Le Mans, I don't mind using especially without a force-feedback wheel-and-pedals setup.  Again, it's not a realistic simulator.  It's a fun arcade game.\n\nMy chief complaint would be that the races are too short, but that's a two-edged blade.  If the race is too easy, you don't want to race so long that you keep lapping second place.  If the race is too hard, you don't want to spend too long limping to the finish line.  It's just a feature of human experience that we want longer races when they're good races.  I'd have liked them to be longer in general though.\n\nI do wish we even had some kind of fake pitstops for trying to run a full 24 hours of Le Mans.  I'm not so delusional that I don't expect to need some damaged repaired if I make an error after 12 hours.  Moreso, the game also needs a save feature for extended races.  The game does autosave your rankings in between events, but you cannot leave in the middle of race and continue it.\n\nIt took me 40 hours to complete the career mode, and I have started a second career at harder difficulty and am playing stand-alone events.  This game is worthwhile in hours per dollar.","May 29, 2015","true","43.3"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","31","37","0","0"

The screen resolution wasn't the best and it actually looked better on the 360 in my opinion. BUT by deleting a hardware restriction file, options for 1080p are available. Stunning.\n\nI have all 3 methods of controlling vehicles and I have to say using a racing wheel is my favorite. It's realistic, and sliding a drift car around at an angle of 30+ degrees is a lot of fun. Xbox controllers are still very usable and for a new player, might be the way to go since the keyboard has you pressing keys to turn left/right around sweeping corners.

Well, I readjusted some settings, I forget which, and then I got to play it. And damn, was it worth it. It's an absolutely gorgeous game with an interesting mix between arcade and simulation style racing, getting just as in-depth as you want it to be.\n\nThe GRID World mode is essentially your average career mode, but it allows you a lot of choice in regards to what events you participate in. A wide list of event options is open to you, some events being a new style of racing to get accustomed to and some (like Demolition Derby) being one-offs. You'll earn respect in each jurisdiction for impressive finishes, and you'll earn more of it for self-imposed challenges like turning up the difficulty, turning off assists, and most boldly, entirely disabling the option to restart a race from the pause menu. Like I said, it's as in-depth as you want it, so if you want to go hardcore, the game will respect that and reward you accordingly. Even on a low difficulty, though, I still managed to accrue some high levels of respect for consistent victories. Also, I noticed that just when I felt like I was running out of events to play, a new tier of them unlocked, leaving more and more to play even when I started seeing the same locations repeatedly.\n\nThe Flashback feature is a godsend. Screwed up somewhere? Go to the instant replay, rewind, and hit the button (WARNING: F12 is one of the buttons) to continue the race right from there. You only have a limited supply of them, though, and if you went for Pro Mode to disable restarting from the pause menu, you get no Flashbacks either.\n\nSome event types will get on your nerves, no doubt about it, and teammates will often be a pain. But more often than not, GRID is a quite thrilling experience that really gives you the feeling of managing your own team, from choosing your sponsors (which offer different challenges to earn your payout, such as finishing in a certain place) to choosing your teammate. Once you get up into those higher ranks on the driver leaderboards, you'll look back and think, "I earned this".","December 31, 2013","true","23.4"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

I think it gets forgotten because of games like Forza & Gran Tursimo but it has been doing things other series haven't for a very long time.\n\nFor starters, GRID is a racing game. Not a rally racing game, or tracks, or street racing. It's a racing game, so you can do just about any kind of auto racing you can think of. Most games limit their races to a specific style, which can be great for getting the best experience, but in GRID's case they were able to add a number of styles without compromising any of them.\n\nThere aren't nearly as many cars as we've come to expect from modern racing games, only 45, but because of the various race styles you're forced to use a wide of those cars.\n\nThere is a reason for that, though. Codemasters, the creators of GRID and the Dirt series, want the focus of the game to be racing, not driving. Not a bad plan for a racing game.\n\nThe only downside to this game I experienced was primarily caused by my expectations for it. I was expecting a game like Need for Speed, but this is a bit more simulation than arcade, although it is very much an arcade style racer. However, early on I anticipated drifting around turns and not sliding into walls. It was a little frustrating at first, but then I gave it enough time(not long) to really get the hang of it.\n\nAfter that the game was a lot of fun to play.\n","May 6, 2015","true","12.1"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

I've never had a chance to play any of them, but I wish I did! Before playing this, I had about an hour of gameplay on Grid Autosport, but decided I'd get through this game first. Because of the simulation-like racing of Autosport, I was kind of expecting the same from Grid 1. And it is, but some of it crosses more into an arcade racing game.\n\nGrid is fun from the get-go. A nice variety of street racing courses in Japan and USA as well as real world tracks in all countries. The amount of different racing modes also keep the game exciting. When you get bored of a standard race, you can move on to drift racing, derby races and pro touge sprint races. You have your own driving team once you earn up a bit of money, you can have a teammate for races and all of your cars have the same team finish.\n\nIt's not by any means a perfect game though. It's almost impossible to race with traction or stability control off, because you'll be constantly spinning. Driving over grass and sand is a lot more of a nightmare than it should be, But if you're a good driver then that shouldn't be a problem. ;) I also get bored of doing the Le Mans race after ever 3-4 tournaments I participate in. The end of race seasons come by pretty quick. However, this is a very fun, arcade-meets-simulation racing game, and I recommend this to anyone who likes to earn millions of dollars in racing games, and also those who are more of an arcade racing fan than simulation. This game might be the perfect balance for you.","November 1, 2015","true","9.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Wow, what a great racing game.\n\n// OLD REVIEW //\nMy experience with Grid: race loads, engines rev, crash at first corner. Reload race. Repeat ad nausem. The game looks great, but it's ferociously difficult. Unlike Forza, there's absolutely no learning curve. Plus the AI is absolutely out to kill you. I really want to like Grid, but it's taking a long, long time to get the hang of it. Also, I find it very frustrating that the keybindings only have ONE possible setting, so if I bind a key to my racing wheel, it no longer works on the keyboard. I learned early on to only use the wheel for driving, and leave all the other buttons on their default bindings. It is a very pretty looking game, though, and you definitely get a feeling of the POWER of the cars you're driving. Mostly this just makes me want to play Forza, though.","June 3, 2015","true","9.4"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","13","17","3","1"

Sadly all kind of MP is long dead, so whatever you're doing is gonna be singleplayer-only.

I owned Toca world touring cars for the ps1, Toca racing driver, Toca racing driver 2 and also the 3rd one, all which are for the PS2. Jump to 2007 where I got the Xbox 360, I heard Toca racing driver is back but this time they changed the name to "Race driver Grid". Me and my dad went to a gaming store to buy the game and when I got home, I quickly went to my room, turn on my Xbox, put the disc in and play it. Aaaannnd, I barely touch it because my 7 years old brain told me "it was too complicated". I didn't touched the game until late 2015 (THAT LONG BOYS N GIRLS) and the disc was full with scratches. In other words, Rip in Porsches.\nHop to 2016 where I was messing around playing a game with my friend and he told me he wanted to play GRID. I was a bit shocked and asked him "Wait, u can play grid on steam?" and he replied with 1 word "Yes." I quit the game and checked to the store and to my surprise, the game had 80% discount. I bought the game, download it and play it for quite awhile.   This is my experience and my opinion on Race Driver Grid.\n* END OF F L A S H B A C K S*\n\nFirst of all, I was surprised that my PC can run this game smoothly. My PC is categorized as a potato and it runs like in the Xbox with slightly better graphics. And if you're saying "Well d4le, this game is made in 2007. How come u find it surprising?" There are games made in that year where my potato is screaming for help and in this case, it wasn't screaming. Though there were times where the fps is dropping, I don't really mind because it's not really major. Speaking about the graphics, this game has some pretty nice graphics & visuals. At the time which I believe was the competitor for Forza, I liked this more because the color and you can see how well detailed if you had an accident on a corner or you rammed a car on purpose like when my brain was 7 years old.\n\nSecond, I fell in love with the gameplay. Yes, I do know this game can be frustrating and I know this game isn't really realistic. But when you get the hang of it, you feel this big sense of accomplishment like "YOU DID IT SON. I'M PROUD OF YOU". There was this one moment when I used an old mustang against a Honda NSX in a Touge race. The level was extreme and It was painfully hard but after couple of restarts and start to realize my mistakes, I did it. I felt like I was the king of the world and I literally screamed to my monitor saying "HAAHAHAH LOOK AT ME NOW, BOYS. I'M THE CHAMP". In short, I had a lot of fun with the gameplay and with all my seriousness, I can't wait playing it again.\n\nThird, the cars and the track selection are awesome. There's actually a DLC for this game which I'm not mistaken, they added a Bugatti veyron and other cars and also other tracks that I might have forgotten, but even if you don't have money to buy it, it doesn't really matter. The thing I remembered is the San Francisco track and I also remembered every time I race against a Mustang GTR, he always fail at the corner before the last chicane. Even if I race or drift alone in that track, I will still remember it as the Mustang corner.\n\nHowever, there are things sadly I have to nitpick.\nProbably the only thing that is quite bothering me is the controls and physics. Every car controls differently which is great and understandable. But oh my lord, the default force feedback is so awful. If you don't know what I did, I spent just around the first 15 minutes of the game just to tune the force feedback (if you want to know what I truly did, I just put 10% more on it except the strength) and after that, it made the game like how I wanted to. Don't get me wrong though, I like the EGO engine and I enjoyed the first DiRT because it's a good mixture between arcade and simulation, but in some aspects there are parts where the car gets too twitchy to the point of frustration. On my right brain, I see it as a challenge. However with my left brain, I see it as the other way around.\n\nIn conclusion and even though the controls are a bit weird, this game is still an awesome racing game and I will recommend it for ones who adore racing games in general.","April 13","true","13.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","10","12","4","0"

The amount of obvious rubberbanding went incredible, you can cut all the corners just perfectly, make a lot of clean overtakes - but it is all pointless cause as soon as you get to the final lap you can expect podium competitors catch you up with the speed of the millenium falcon. I understand this way of making the game more challenging, but when with every next race it becomes more and more the main (or only) part of AI skill, the game simply becomes a piece of annoying arcade turd, forcing you into bashing, smashing and redoing the same stage on and on till you are sick.\n\nHonestly I just rage-quited after a few tries of getting through Ravenwest lead during Prototype Championship in J-Speed Super One. But enough is enough, I am simply tired of starting all the time in the last place (what the heck is the method of placing the starting position? Is it simply random?), forced to bypass a bunch of f***ing idiots (the biggest one being your teammate, I mean WTF man, are we for sure in the same team?!) bashing into each other or in the rear of your car. When you are done with them rookies, no matter how good you are it is hardly possible to keep your nerves together when all you can see are Ravenwest taking corners with ridiculous speed without even breaking… ♥♥♥♥ it! Try to do that exactly the same way – yeah, now you can rewind…\n\nOther big issue is that game simply gets boring in the half of the way of the ‘Grid World’. I really enjoyed touges, D-Derby were just amazing and Pro-Types were incredible. But the second half of the game is mostly all about endurance (which is more a fight with your understeering car than taking care of competitors) or drift (where AI completly sucks and you nail the scoreboard with your eyes closed).\nI do not want to dwell on the pros of this game, because there is as many of them as cons – and cons are the part that should be noticed – for getting rid of them in the future (yeah, we already had GRID 2 and Autosport so maybe it is too late to say this) and thus making them better.\n\nWell, there is one special positive thing about entire series - each car has its own unique ‘soul’ making driving them a lot of fun – hard to say it feels like real but for sure you can feel the power and heaviness of muscle car. And that is the thing that will make me finish the game. Even if I am temporarily annoyed by it.","May 14","false","25.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","6","6","3","0"

Whenever I want to jump back into a racing game, I'll play GRID. There is no need to spend time acquiring different parts and tuning them, only to lose a race and have to go back and forth between the Garage and the track to get a setup that works. It's all about the racing and pushing yourself to do better.\n\nThere are some nice licensed tracks like Nürburgring, Spa, and Turkey; and there are some great fantasy tracks as well. I like the hilly  track in the scenic mountains of Okutama, and Long Beach with it's tight corners is really fun in Formula 3 cars. Shibuya is a lot of fun too--lots of corners on a wet street circuit at night in an electrifying Japanese shopping district (no interruptions from Godzilla and Megaguirus).\n\nYou can do the Le Mans 24 Hours in different classes. I think it runs about 15 minutes, but the sun will set and you'll race in the dark for a bit before sunrise.\n\nGRID has a nice roster of cars.The Lamborghini Murcielago is a favorite of mine here. This is the game that made me a fan of using cockpit views, and I wasn't expecting to like them. GRID also innovated a rewind feature called Flashbacks, so you can go back and retry those corners you blew without having to restart the whole race.\n\nI play GRID with a mod that removed the game's yellow tint, and I recommend that.

While accepting and completing racing offers from three different regions (US, EU, Japan) the player gains money and reputation, which will lead later to enquiries from sponsors with own missions. The player has to complete these throughout a match, to gain a bonus on money and reputation.\n\nThe graphics are well made for the year 2008 thanks to the lighting effects, highly detailed exterior and interior of the 43 fully licenced cars and the amazing soft-body damage to vehicles and environments. However, compared to newer racers and also its sequel "Grid 2" they are obviously outdated. In the year 2010 the community released a "Ultra Mod Compilation" on Steam, which modifies not only the sun reflections but also the shadows, details of the track and so on. It is mentionable that this mod also requires a stronger PC build what should not be a problem for newer PCs anyway.\n\nIn its gameplay GRID™ does feel more arcadish than like a real simulator. Determined by the difficulty setting the player has the option to use a limited "flashback" mechanic. Does the player regret driving against the wall, he is allowed to rewind the gameplay up to ten seconds and resume the game at a point of his choice, which simplifies the race a bit more. Money and reputation increase with higher difficulty and less rewinds but also decrease with lower difficulty and more rewinds.\nThe goal for a race is from time to time slightly different. While the player has to finish as the first driver in one match, he just needs to be first in the car class in another. Several type events, such as drifting, demolition derby and the 24 Hours of Le Mans, give thankfully some variety, which is absolutely needed for a game with up to 26+ hours of gameplay according to the website HowLongToBeat.\n\nThe AI of this game is unfortunately not acceptable if not awful. Drivers from the same car class are often paradoxically faster than the own car, no matter how the player drives. The end justifies sometimes the means - even for the AI - so some of them crash into the player and walls without a reason, blocking him and destroying the possibility to win the race. This leads to the point, where the player has to restart the whole match, since he does not have the hope to catch up with the other cars after a crash.\n\nBesides of the AI there is another reason why the player has to restart a match or does not even try to finish the game - the controls. Admittedly, every car in GRID™ feels different in its handling, what is refreshing compared to other more arcadish racers. Whatsoever, breaking too strong or driving on grass and sand ends abruptly in turning the car controlless around itself and crashing either in the wall or in another car, even when only one or two wheels touched these elements. Chicanes are too hard to drive, since even on the normal track the car can turn without a reason. Restarts of restarts occure and destroy the fun more or less immediately after the fourth restart from the same race mission.\n\nGRID™ includes also a multiplayer, which is sadly not available anymore since 2011 due to the fact that the servers have been taken offline.\n\nAll in all GRID™ is not necessarily bad considering its age, but caused from its arcadish apperance graphically and physically it is hard to play through the whole game or even only one race without restarting twice or more often. For arcade racer lovers probably a well made game with some weaknesses, but all those who are looking for an real simulator should just move on with Grid 2 and Autosport. Recommendable on a sale.\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ RÉSUMÉ]▬▬▬▬●\nAfter already 12 hours into GRID™'s sequel "Grid 2", I tried not to have too high expecations or standards or even compare it. But even when taking this game as its own, it is hard to like it. The controls and AI made me rage so much that not even the nice tracks and detailed cars could satisfy me. Restarting a mission so often caused from the unfair AI or touching grass and sand, which makes the car not controlable anymore, made me quit this game more than once, even as an experienced racing (simulator/arcade) gamer.\n\nThe game has a lot of positive reviews, so I guess it is only a matter of personal taste and people who love weaker arcadish simulators will love this game as well.\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ TL;DR]▬▬▬▬●\n[✔] Great graphics plus an "Ultra Mod Compilation" from the community\n[✔] 43 fully licenced, highly detailed cars with unique handling\n[✔] Soft-body damage to vehicles and environments which change the car handling\n\n[✖] Unfair AI, crashing often for no reason and blocking the player\n[✖] AI cars from the same class are often faster than the own\n[✖] More arcade racer than an actual simulator\n[✖] Awful controls e.g. when touching the grass or sand, the car gets uncontrolable\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ MEDIA]▬▬▬▬▬●\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppye4UcrEYg\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=648689967\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked this review and want to see more from me, give this review a thumbs up!

Yes, it's an arcade racer, so the multiplayer experience suffers because of it, but it more than makes up for that with its impeccable career mode. The progression is fluid and natural, the game (with one VERY notable exception in the form of Le Mans) never gets old and the pacing is just right. It has genuine difficulty, aided by an AI that's WAY ahead of its time.\n\nRavenwest bring all the flair and excitement that you'd expect from an honorable "designated #1 enemy" team, and they're hugely hyped all throughout the game. Knowing how other games would treat something like this, you'd normally expect the races against them to be disappointing simply because they wouldn't be able to live up to the hype.\n\nAnd yet, with some exceptions, CM managed to get it right. Nathan McKane and Rick Scott are fantastic bosses to go up against. The atmospheric value of the Shibuya drift duel with Rick Scott is unfathomably high, while the Viper vs Viper duel with TOCA legend Nathan McKane combines hype, thrill and extreme difficulty into one hell of an exhilarating package.\n\nAnd then there's the soundtrack. Good lord, the soundtrack.\n\n\n\nOne of the best racing games of all time. Possibly even one of the outright best games of all time. Nothing short of fantastic even 6 years after its release. Just make sure you remove the ugly yellow filter.\n\nHighly recommend it. A true classic.

Codmasters made a good balance between a racing simulator and a normal arcade driving game. It's easy to get start with like the NFS franchise, but a little more difficult than that because you'd find out that driving flat out will ruin your car. And by this way, it makes you to race with skills. You'll learn to brake before corners, you'll learn to drive in efficient racing lines, you'll learn to avoid contact with your competitors to matain the performance of your car. This is a game where you'll achieve your dream of being a pro race driver. By the way NFS makes it possible for you to drive fancy cars, go outlaws and feel good, it's great too.\n\nAnother thing to make you feel like a pro was the 24h Le Mans. They compact the real time 24h into 12min in the career mode, and made a day and night shift for it, which looked so great. Besides this compact version of 24h you can choose for 24min to even real time 24h in race day mode. And you can test drive any of your car. Just driving in Nürburgring, trying to go a perfect run and improving the lap time is a great fun for me.\n\nGRID has the best cockpit view out of the two. Why two? Because GRID2 doesn't have a cockpit view, I'd leave that to the review of GRID2. So there were so many datails in the cockpit, and it's live, the dashboard and the gear changing signal are really doing what they should be doing. It feels just like drving in a real race car. And the damage had a lot of details too, the damges are taken by parts. Steering, suspension and so on, and the lead to different problem in your driving.\n\nAnd actually there are downsides in this game. Your team mate was acting like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥. If it drives badly it'll be staying in the back of the pack through out the race and get your team beaten by Ravenwest. But if he's driving great, like Tom Rockford (the best I found in the game) you may find, he'll bump you, block you and spin you out. Maybe codemasters thought those bots were driving ♥♥♥♥ so they sent you a "team mate" to disturb you and make things more challenging. Yeah, by spinning me out and pull me straight from the 1st place down to the last but one (crashed) in the last one minute of Le Mans. I should have fired him.\n\nYour team mate was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but wait, there's a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the track. Every first corner of the track, if you're the last of the pack, trust me, that takes more than skills to get out of there in one piece. And after the first corner, you still got ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to pass on the way. They care nothing about your lines. For example if you go parallel with one car through the corner and you're the inside one and inccidently you're on his line, he 'll definitely crash on you to get on his line. Two results for this, you spin out and he goes out, or the two cars stick together and disabling the turning of each other then head for the wall. I can remember in one race, going clockwise in Okutama, GRID position in 7th, and the first corner made me freak out.\n\nBut this game is still great, for a race drving gamer or for those who want to change a flavor from arcade drving game to a race simulator. And it's not expensive, really worth buying.","February 8","true","84.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

Just in the early stages of the game, but it seems that the AI competition is no slouch when it comes to bumping and grinding.  Courses are authentic and challenging; take too much damage, and you're out of the race, which adds a nice (if small) bit of realism to the game.\n\nXbox controller seems to work fairly well with the game.\n\nStunning graphics, great sound.  Gameplay feels responsive, not clunky at all.  Lovin' Grid so far!  :)\n\nIf you're looking for a hardcore challenge/simulation, maybe 'steer' clear of this game.  If you're just looking for some fast paced racing action, I'd say the regular price of the game is worth it for sure.\n\n10/10","May 12","true","3.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

They all feel the same - that boring driving a car feeling. This game isn't that. Sure its a standard racing game but they do it well. You get to race in 3 different regions, USA, EU, and Japan. USA races are rush through the skyscrapers in your muscle cars smashing and bashing through the tight turns where as European races are the long open wheel cars that bumping someone can crash both of you and everyone behind you and finally Japan loves its drifting competitions and crazy drifting required race tracks.\n\n(Japan gives me the most trouble as I don't understand the drifting in the game and that is probably my biggest complaint)\n\nAlso in the main game every "year" you race a 24 hour race (24 mins in game) its intense and it really shows you how much you have yet to learn or how much you have learned about the racing mechanics. When you get first it really feels great because you just played one race without crashing for almost a half hour and won. The downside is its terribly hard and frustrating. Ive raged a small bit at that race although it is skippable probably for that reason.\n\nOverall if you are looking at the game its worth the buy but there is a sequel.

The newly implemented flashback system also lessens the burden of minor (yet sometimes costly) mistakes made on the tracks, leading to a more fluid driving experience\n+ Graphically the game is stunning, with superb lighting and shadows, as well as high-quality textures and car details; topped off with good crowd details that make it stand out as one of the best looking racing games to date\n+ Sound-wise, the cars engines sound authentic, and the personalisation that the game offers when it comes to your driver rounds off the games audio extremely well\n+ The game also boasts a lot of content when it comes to the amount of tracks, disciplines and events that you can take part in. It will take around 8 ½ hours to just get your global licence, and many more if you want to take part in every event the game lets you participate in; the career mode is certainly lengthy.\n\n\nNegative\n- The only real noticeable negative in the sound department is that the in-game dialogue in the game will get repetitive quickly, leaving you wanting to turn it off after hours invested into the game (which is unfortunate because the voice acting is absolutely fine)\n- While the team management system is a welcome addition, your teammate rarely ever performs well in a race or benefits your career, making it sort of pointless for them to be included in the career mode at all.\n\n\nVerdict\n“A simply great driving experience, Race Driver: GRID manages to hit all the right notes with me in what a racing game should look and feel like. Fans of racing titles should definitely check this one out (if you haven’t already).”\n\n8.5/10 TJBs","February 15, 2015","true","8.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

So often in other games the driving experience is pretty much the same from car to car and the racing gets boring very fast. This is where GRID is different. Every car reacts much differently from the last, as well as there being several racing styles to master. The same race in a new car can be a whole new experience with a whole new set of challenges to overcome.\n\nThe game rewards you for not driving like an absolute maniac, and being more pro behind the wheel. Sometimes you'll find yourself defending your team mates possition for a strategic team victory that gives you more sponsor money even if it means finishing 2nd. The game succeeds in being both realistic and arcadey enough to appeal to any fan of racing games.\n\nIt's taken a long time to find a good racing game that I could put right up there with the great Gran Turismo.\n\nBUY THIS!

It feels like a Codemasters took ToCA and made it so it appeals to the casual gamer (which is what they essentially did). The game has awide variety of different cars ranging from a little, underpowered japanese hatchback turned into a tire slayer to a top-of-the-class LMP1 bolide designed in a special facility. You get to form and manage your very own racing team, recruit team members, have sponsorships and design team liveries. The driving physics are fun and easy to adapt to. The game doesn't punish you if you don't win every single race. Sponsorship objectives add more variety and challange to the races.\n\nI bought this game from a code marketplace for cheaper than a Happy Meal, and after an hour into the game I felt like I robbed the people over at Codemasters because this game is just so fun.\n\n9/10","April 21","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics are good, the racing is excellent and its well thought out.\n\nThe big feature of this game is the Instant Replay: you can rewind time about 3-4s and retry a section of track. Since you can be sent flying off track by the smallest of unintentional bumps this is pretty vital.\n\nMy only gripes about this game is the AI, these are possibly different at harder difficulties but I have no plan on finding out:\n\n1- the speed boost AI cars get when you are out in front means it is very hard to get more than 1-2s clear (you can't really build up a buffer in case of accidents)\n2-the AI will not risk crashing into you if you are in front. You can slalom your way down a track keeping much faster cars behind you because whenever you cut in front  of them they'll slam on the breaks.... BUT if you are side by side with an AI car it'll just side swipe you (often throwing you off the track).\n3- the AI hates uphill and loves downhill... no idea why but on a lot of uphill sections I can clear by 1-2s, all of which I lose coming down again. This is odd when I'm leading and helpful for overtaking (especially since I can just sit in front and block coming down) but a total pain while following: AI cars keep breaking for no reason on the uphill and then flying away from me coming down...","April 24","true","17.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That's all you really need to know. It's a bit arcade-y, and that threw me off a bit when I realized you can fly through most corners without braking, but whatever. It's a lot of fun, and the damage model beats most games.\n\nSo if you do get this game, make sure to install BroSki's mod to remove the ugly yellow tint. Once you do this, the game looks like amazing, like GTA IV with ENB, or maybe Assetto Corsa. Also the performance is great - if you have a modern graphics card you can max it out - my GTX 970 can DSR from 4K + ultra @ 60FPS\n\nEDIT: the more I play this game, the more I'm annoyed by its flaws. For example, the AI needs work: the first corner of every race is always a pile-up, they take very strange racing lines which result in them pit maneuvering you, and they constantly push against you which renders steering impossible.\n\nAlso, for some reason most of the tracks have props in terribly unsafe places - tokyo docks involves so much dodging of boxes, shipping crates and forklifts.\n\nThe worst part about these props is that they tend to get stuck under the front of your car, either jacking the front end up and therefore losing steering or sending your car barrel rolling down the track.\n\nBut hey, I still recommend it.","June 15, 2015","true","8.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And most of the time you are placed far back, and you have to overcome 10+ cars in a matter of 2 laps. This then requires you to drive aggresively, often times hitting other cars just to get ahead of them. But this leads us to another problem - you spin out of control easily. Even if a slow ♥♥♥ car hits you while you're turning at the corner, you spin out and and half the time it's impossible to recover.  The AI is horrible as well. I think the game really wants you to lose. The cars in the middle (4th-10th place) drive like ♥♥♥♥ and the top 3 cars usually drive amazingly. Since you're also put somewhere near the back the ♥♥♥♥ drivers slow you down, and they hit you almost all the time. This causes the better drivers (1st to 3rd) to pull away while the ♥♥♥♥ cars drag you to hell.\n\nThe grip is inconsistent as well. It seems as though the opponents have much more grip than you. I can feel the car's understeer when I push it to it's limits, but the AI car (supposedly in the same car) can just blast and accelerate through the apex. I've also seen that the AI cars don't slide, even when they're suppsoed to. In short, AI drivers have NFS physics while you have the GRID one. There is also a track (Milan or Washington, can't remember) that seemingly has inconsistent ground. Once you get past the bridge, it becomes incredibly slidey. You'd have to brake early in order not to slide while enemies can just go through it normally.\n\nBut there are some good parts. After you get past the first few races the game begins to get fun. You unlock more cars and teammates as you make your way to the top. There's also a Global license after the Pro license (USA,EU,Japan). The racers here are noticably better and more competitive than the lower ranked racers. The Head 2 Head battles with Ravenwest are also great. Intense downhill battles and circuit racing with muscle cars wherein a small mistake could cost you the race.\n\nThere are also several race types like drift and Le Mans. This game has hands down one of the best and coolest drifting mechanics. With a controller, you can actually feel the throttle and how much you need to push the car just to get it to turn. Le Mans races are quite long but satisfying.\n\nThis game also has an amazing finale. 1 v 1 , your crew vs Ravenwest on the Circuit de la Sarthe. NPC difficulty set to EXTREME and only 1 flashback. It's an incredibly long race (possibly 10+ minutes) and the enemy is always on your back. A small mistake, like missing the braking point, can make you lose.\n\n7.5/10","January 3, 2014","true","19.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The game starts almost immideatly, there is no pesky tutorial that takes out 30 minutes of your time.\nThe game works fairly reastically. It's on the line between simulator and arcade racer, leaning more to the arcade side. I think, however, if you're a casual, you will enjoy it too, as did I when I first begun playing it in late 2011.\n\nHowever, every Codies game comes with some flaws; sometimes you might get stuck in a wall and clip inside it, but the biggest problem with this game is how clunky the game is without a controller. Until I got my controller about 40 hours of playtime in, I wasn't enjoying myself fully. It's fairly evident that the game was designed to be used with a controller, but a wheel can also be used, despite the aforementioned arcade label.\n\nIf you are looking for at least 40 hours of enjoyement with the good leveling system, this is the game for you. The fact the controls without a gamepad are clunky is far from outweighing the realism of this game.","December 29, 2011","true","76.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played the demo on the XBox 360 and it was fantastic, but the version I fell for hard was the P.C. release. The cars and general mechanics of the game go from racer to simulator immediately across platforms and get even more incredible as your graphics capacity grows with better cards and CPUs.\n\nEven with my GeForce GTX 275 it is hard to max out the games full potential so there is allot to enjoy with this title and it still brings home everything a racing fan desires many years after it's initial release date.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/expound/recommended/12750/","expound","expound MSi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/expound/","51 products in account","Racedriver Grid the first instalment in the Grid series is another great game which carries the traditional Codemasters racing feel and appearence. This is my second copy of the game (my first was purchesed on disk), and my third time to play the game through. There are tons of great experiences to have with this game especially over the new installment Grid 2 which goes by a differnt style just like Dirt 2 to 3.\n\nThings I like about this game.\n\nNumber one most important for a good racing game is the physics, which in Grid are some of the best around, especially for 2008 standards, the cars move smoothly but not in an over the top way so you get a nice balence between casual and simulator I think most people would be impressed by it however it does lean more towards the racing/car finatic.\n\nSecondly, my favorite part of the game is the ability to manage your own team or drive for others. The team managemnt aspect to this game enhanced the overall product by 100%, you get to decide, hire and choose from literally hundereds of team-mates and then fire at the click of a button. Playing with a teamate can be both exillerating and painful, whatching your team mate say "I'm out of this race" when your about to win isnt fun. Never the less team-mates forgiven I love the customisation. The majority of track racing games give you very limited acces to making your car pretty but Grid has a great simple solution to easy customisation, I'll explain how it works if your not interested in customisation skip to then next paragraph. So this is how the customisation works, you get to scroll through patterns presets to choose from you then decide a primary and secondary color applying this to all of your team owned cars for both you and your team-mate.\n\nSo far all of this may sound pretty ordinary but what impresed me more than the whole physics system is the ability to gain and equip sponsorships for your car, this both comes as decals placed on your cars and rewards for placings and achivments throughout the race/chaimpoinship. For example Ebay Motors in your sponsor and they will give you $25,000 for finishing the race in lower then 3rd position with no damage done to your car. This will apply to both you and your team-mate.\n\nIf youve played any other Codemasters racing games you will be familiar to the option to rewind time to save you from a crash ect. This system is really great and of cource the less you use the higher your reward is which works well. This is a little extra which really made this a great game for me.\n\nWhat I didnt like about this game.\n\nI liked the background comantry of your coach/pit crew telling you what is wrong with your car, giving you tips and informing you where your team-mate is however this is often incorrect in will tell you thing like Nelsion Piquet as just spun out when he is driving fine right in front of you. This often distracted me in intense situations however if you don't mind you can turn it off.\n\nI own the vast majority of Codemasters racing games and they all carry the same trait apart from Grid 2 and Dirt 3 the two newest, this is the theame of text and menu styling, it is very county/grundge and this dosnt tickle my pickle but it shouldn't ruin the game for you.\n\nSo should I buy Grid or GRID 2?\n\nIf your wondering which game to buy Grid or Grid 2 it depends, if you want a casual racer where the menus will make you repeditally smash the keyboard into your face and the physics make you feel like your your in a calm swaying tree then buy GRID 2 but if you want some knuckle bitting intensive hardcore racing then buy Grid. I do recomed Grid more but if you want really nice graphics and are looking for a more arcady racer then its not for.\n\n1. Some extra things you will need to know GRID 2 may not run well on your PC comapred to Grid but it has fabulous graphics just have a look on Youtube for a comparison.\n\n2. Grid is probablly not the game if your into really casual racing but for the evermore decreasing price of the game its one to have is your Steam libary.\n\nMy overall score I give Grid is 90/100","December 27, 2013","true","25.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This was the game that was considered an NFS slayer back in 2007-2008, when NFS franchise was already going downwards. I spent well over 300 hours into it when I did not yet have a Steam account. This game had the best graphics, and still looks really promising even today. The damage model is simply mindblowing, that I spent maybe half the time just crashing into thiings. The drift mode is one of the best you can find on all racing games, with authentic (not necessarily realistic but you get the feeling) handling physics. There is really no reason why you refuse to get this game and beat it. It does have its own drawbacks, most of which is the feeling of weightlessness of cars, and the non-linear steering which makes using a wheel a bit frustrating. However, none of the drawbacks is enough of pulling the game down, to be honest.","April 27, 2014","true","25.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This was the game that was considered an NFS slayer back in 2007-2008, when NFS franchise was already going downwards. I spent well over 300 hours into it when I did not yet have a Steam account. This game had the best graphics, and still looks really promising even today. The damage model is simply mindblowing, that I spent maybe half the time just crashing into thiings. The drift mode is one of the best you can find on all racing games, with authentic (not necessarily realistic but you get the feeling) handling physics. There is really no reason why you refuse to get this game and beat it. It does have its own drawbacks, most of which is the feeling of weightlessness of cars, and the non-linear steering which makes using a wheel a bit frustrating. However, none of the drawbacks is enough of pulling the game down, to be honest.","April 27, 2014","true","25.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/expound/recommended/12750/","expound","expound MSi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/expound/","51 products in account","Racedriver Grid the first instalment in the Grid series is another great game which carries the traditional Codemasters racing feel and appearence. This is my second copy of the game (my first was purchesed on disk), and my third time to play the game through. There are tons of great experiences to have with this game especially over the new installment Grid 2 which goes by a differnt style just like Dirt 2 to 3.\n\nThings I like about this game.\n\nNumber one most important for a good racing game is the physics, which in Grid are some of the best around, especially for 2008 standards, the cars move smoothly but not in an over the top way so you get a nice balence between casual and simulator I think most people would be impressed by it however it does lean more towards the racing/car finatic.\n\nSecondly, my favorite part of the game is the ability to manage your own team or drive for others. The team managemnt aspect to this game enhanced the overall product by 100%, you get to decide, hire and choose from literally hundereds of team-mates and then fire at the click of a button. Playing with a teamate can be both exillerating and painful, whatching your team mate say "I'm out of this race" when your about to win isnt fun. Never the less team-mates forgiven I love the customisation. The majority of track racing games give you very limited acces to making your car pretty but Grid has a great simple solution to easy customisation, I'll explain how it works if your not interested in customisation skip to then next paragraph. So this is how the customisation works, you get to scroll through patterns presets to choose from you then decide a primary and secondary color applying this to all of your team owned cars for both you and your team-mate.\n\nSo far all of this may sound pretty ordinary but what impresed me more than the whole physics system is the ability to gain and equip sponsorships for your car, this both comes as decals placed on your cars and rewards for placings and achivments throughout the race/chaimpoinship. For example Ebay Motors in your sponsor and they will give you $25,000 for finishing the race in lower then 3rd position with no damage done to your car. This will apply to both you and your team-mate.\n\nIf youve played any other Codemasters racing games you will be familiar to the option to rewind time to save you from a crash ect. This system is really great and of cource the less you use the higher your reward is which works well. This is a little extra which really made this a great game for me.\n\nWhat I didnt like about this game.\n\nI liked the background comantry of your coach/pit crew telling you what is wrong with your car, giving you tips and informing you where your team-mate is however this is often incorrect in will tell you thing like Nelsion Piquet as just spun out when he is driving fine right in front of you. This often distracted me in intense situations however if you don't mind you can turn it off.\n\nI own the vast majority of Codemasters racing games and they all carry the same trait apart from Grid 2 and Dirt 3 the two newest, this is the theame of text and menu styling, it is very county/grundge and this dosnt tickle my pickle but it shouldn't ruin the game for you.\n\nSo should I buy Grid or GRID 2?\n\nIf your wondering which game to buy Grid or Grid 2 it depends, if you want a casual racer where the menus will make you repeditally smash the keyboard into your face and the physics make you feel like your your in a calm swaying tree then buy GRID 2 but if you want some knuckle bitting intensive hardcore racing then buy Grid. I do recomed Grid more but if you want really nice graphics and are looking for a more arcady racer then its not for.\n\n1. Some extra things you will need to know GRID 2 may not run well on your PC comapred to Grid but it has fabulous graphics just have a look on Youtube for a comparison.\n\n2. Grid is probablly not the game if your into really casual racing but for the evermore decreasing price of the game its one to have is your Steam libary.\n\nMy overall score I give Grid is 90/100","December 27, 2013","true","25.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are driving physics like GTA where it's meant to be slightly funny, and there are physics like Gran Turismo and other driving simulators that are meant to be serious and realistic. This game tries to be somewhere in between and fails miserably. Your car seems to weigh about 1lb and the AI's around 2000lb or so. If you car barely touches theirs, you'll go flying off the track and they won't even move. Also, if you just touch the sand/grass even a little, your car spins out. That's it.\n\nIf you want a fun driving sim, stick to GTA or Midnight Club or Dirt. A real driving sim like Arsetto Corsa or Gran Turismo would suit you better if you want a more realistic driving experience (yeah, I know. Gran Turismo's not on PC). Either way, I'm glad this was on sale so I didn't waste too much money.","June 22, 2014","true","0.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Set the difficulty to novice or easy and it plays more like an arcade. Or set the difficulty to expert and play it like a simulator. Has lots of different cars each with it's own unique way of handling. The racks are fairly diverse and each one has multiple setups, which helps to keep it exciting and not repetitive. It has a flashback system that allows you to turn back time if you get into a crash. I n my opinion it doesn't work very well and is sometimes useless. But the majority of the time it works fine, albeit very clumsy to operate. The game physics are also quite good, but after you play for a while I can't help notice certain blaring flaws, especially in hit detection and how your car handles when it gets hit.\n\nThe sounds are all quite good. The graphics, quite frankly, are amazing for 2007. They look as good as any racing game from 2010 or even 2011.\n\nProbably my biggest issue with the game is the AI. The problem is they aren't affected the same way I am by the game phyics. If I get hit by a car, a certain outcome will occur, but when the AI gets hit in the same way, they will not be affected the same. Usually the result is if I get hit, my car flies wildly out of control, if the AI gets hit they will recover very easily and lose no speed. It's very difficult to spin out the AI or make them crash.\n\nI give it an 8.3/10.","November 29, 2014","true","71.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You're not forced to spend a long time in menus, listening to audio clips, or watching cutscenes between races. You can just jump straight from one race to the next, which is what it's all about. There is no slow-motion crash camera to frustrate you every time you wipe out, and the car's steering matches your inputs on the controller rather than slowing it down to simulate a driver turning a steering wheel.\n\nThere is no story, and car upgrades and customization play a minimal part in the game.

This game beats out GRID 2 and Autosport easily. The two games are still good just not as good as GRID 1. Easily the best of the GRID series and easily better than most NFS titles available. GRID 1 takes first place with GT, Midnight Club and a few NFS games to tie for best Car racing games, but Grid 1 is either tied or second place to those titles depending what kind of racing game person you are.  Debatable for many on which is best among franchises, personally I say this ties with GT series for best and most realisitic physics etc. The game is easily better than most Burnout and NFS recent titles, and DIRT is nothing in comparison to Grid 1. While the game is old (2007) it's still quite ahead of it's time in general especially ahead of the GT released at the time. Visuals are very very very appealing, fun factor is awesome since it's got a balance of the basic arcade and GT realistic kind of gameplay. However anyone who found GT series a bit rough as in difficult this is just about as difficult but a little easier. This is one of the "Essentials" for Steam like Valve/steam exclusive games but this one I think is easily in the top 5 Valve/Steam exclusives list. I reccomend the game to anyone who likes racing games and wants a new experience on the racing world with a large selection of cars to choose from. I would give the game a 9/10 with it's only con being the circuits. I for one like the open world/city street racing feel from Midnight Club and NFS games which this game doesn't offer and the circuits are a bit bland for me at times. As for Pros: Realism but no too realistic that it's annoying, fun factor, replay value and it's distinct system in general for records etc. Replays are awsome in this game compared to many others and thankfully if you don't like replays you don't have to have them. (Note: the replays are slow mo and detailed like in Matrix Trilogy :D so it's super cool etc.) As for who can play it..good news: works on just about any PC especially cheap ♥♥♥ HP laptops etc. with Celeron but on lowest lowest settings etc. Must have for all on steam! I forgot to mention that many people may think this to be just a Need For Speed ProStreet rip off but it's not. If you disliked Prostreet and GT series this series is like the amplified version of pro street with th eonly common factor between the two is a few cars are in both games and that prix racing is mostly similar but the rest is unique. With GT haters the game is alike but it's unique with a lot of options to make the gameplay flow without difficult AI etc. Online no longer works and it's OST (Original Soundtrack) is not a compilation OST it's a instrumental score :"( for those who like to listen to varied genres along with the instrumental scores.","June 15, 2015","true","10.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

This game offers very good single player expererience. Even though it's almost 8 years old by the time this review has been written it aged pretty well. It offers a nice variety of tracks and cars and will keep you busy for quite some time given the price this game will cost you. Force Feedback controller or steering wheel is strongly recommended. AI can be pretty dull at times but this game still offers competetion and replayability due to high individual configuration of driving assistants and fixed cockpit views. Do not expect multiplayer to work: unfortunately servers are dead and you will need hamachi to set up a proper multiplayer game.

Sure, it's rather old game, but let me give you an insight to what to expect.\n\nA proper racing game? No.\nA good, exciting racing experience? Yeah.\n\n\nReasoning\nWhy do I think so?\nI finally finished the last challenge.\nIt doesn't matter how fast you are. This is not about knowing every inch of the racetrack, about knowing your car well.\nThe AI doesn't care if you're fast, you just oblige to a rule set.\nAs soon as you do that, you get exciting races: As in overtaking, being overtaken.\nYou do get your fair share of intense position fights.\nBut: as said, it doesn't matter if you're fast. You'll get wrecked because of collisions, not because you are too slow.\n\nThat is inherently a bad thing for me. Although, in the end, it doesn't really matter.\nGrind through the racing carreer, then take the fun.\nThe fun really starts, when you got all the cars and will be able to choose the car you fancy, the track you'd like to battle and off you go.\nFrom there on, the racing becomes more fun.\nI miss the replays though. But shaving off parts of a second every round is the stuff that makes racing games shine.\nBut as said, that doesn't really mean much in GRID's main part.\n\nThe some words about the mechanics:\nTake this with a grain of salt, as I haven't raced a real Mazda 787B (who'd have thought).\nBUT. You turn in well on braking, you turn well on accelerating.\nYou won't turn on neutral.\nI highly doubt that's how cars behave. As much as I've driven fast cars, this simply isn't true.\nIn that sense, GRID is a very arcadey game, but ends up being fun anyways.\n\nThe cars\nAs much as I love to drive the Mazda 787B and the Nissan 390, the game lacks in the essential racing category: The Le Mans racers.\nWhy do I choose between a Mustang and a Charger, while I miss a Mercedes C9, a Porsche 962 and the likes of the McLaren F1 GTR? Probably the Bentley Prototype?\nIt's a great pleasure to get your hands on the Audi R10 TDI, but the again, why did they stop there?\nYou got to choose many Drift Cars (although I do love them), but those are more like a side story to the main event Le Mans.\nAnd as far as GT-Racing goes, it's utterly sad that they didn't get licences for the japanese GT-series (nowadays SuperGT). But those might be locked to Gran Turismo, as I haven't seen any other game sporting those amazing machines. It's especially strange as the JLOC Lamborghini actually made it into the game - as well as a racing team called RE Amemiya. Just missing essential Le Mans racers.\nIn the end, there are quite some nice cars to drive, but the roster is chosen rather weirdly.","November 15, 2015","true","69.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And listening to the occasional chatter on the radio is cool also. Pretty good graphics IMO. I like the damage your car can take and give.

GRID offered so much variety when it came to cars, tracks and racing disciplines, including drifting and demo derbies, not to mention the cars all have excellent physical and mechanical damage models and it had probably one of the most lifesaving features ever conceived in a racing game: flashbacks. You mess up, you try again. Easy!\nPlaying it on PC for the first time after 5 or 6 years playing it on console, it's still as good as it always was, except now it runs smoother than butter down a saxophone! The only gripe is that the game locks maximum resolution access to 1280x720 but that can be changed by deleting a hardware restriction file.\nLong story short: if you don't have this already, buy it, sale or not! If you've played it on console and are considering buying it on PC, I wouldn't hesitate in doing so!\n9/10\n\nPs: Have your teammates refer to you as Snake, and you've instantly got yourself Metal Gear GRID!","September 7, 2015","true","14.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I will admit to having a bias for them as I have played them far longer than Grid.\nMy references to the Formula One and 24 Hours of Le Mans series are also comparative in nature,\n\nOh man. Where to even begin with this.\n\nPros:\n-Difficulty, for some\n-Range of cars and game modes\n\nCons:\n-DIFFICULTY\nNow people may call me a wimp or otherwise on this but the most realistic racing experience I've had is GranTurismo for Sony's PSP (2009) that features: realistic cars, an optional driving line that changes color on speed (this is quite useful for beginners and veterans alike, as beginners can get used to the track and veterans get reminded of the perfect line), the option to tune cars, a choice between normal and realistic physics, a reasonably large minimap, varied tracks, varying degrees of difficulty in race modes and a TIME TRIAL MODE. SO THAT I CAN GET USED TO THE DRIVING AND THE PHYSICS. Grid won't even let me have a chance to get used to the driving and physics because I get thrown straight into a race with godly AI even at "Basic" difficulty. Someone else noticed that in the LM races the turning point for the car isn't at the front wheels but in the middle. I noticed this as well when I couldn't get around the corner onto Mulsanne as fast as LITERALLY all of the other cars, even the ones in a slower LMGT class. I've raced La Sarthe before on GranTurismo and it was quantifiably easier to control LMP cars and all other cars. I'm currently used to Need for Speed Underground 2 and Undercover physics that offer at the very least near-instant response on steering. The steering and brake lag coupled with the crazy burnout on every acceleration out of corners has persuaded me that this is the most frustrating racing game I have ever played. In NFSU2 and GT I could at least tune the cars to personally change aspects of the ride that I liked and disliked (suspension, camber angles, ride height, aerodynamics, etc.). In Grid there is literally NOTHING I can do to gain an advantage without dying 200 times or restarting every race 1000 times. And to me, that ain't fun at all.\n-Difficult course in the BEGINNING of the campaign???\n-No tutorial????\n-NO TIME TRIAL MODE????????????\n-No tuning????????? See people who expect realistic racing expect tuning capabilities to..um you know...FIX THE UNDERSTEER ON ALL LM AND OPEN WHEEL CARS AND BURNOUTS ON ALL OF THE CARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nBottom line, I personally loathe this game for a bunch of terrible decisions made by an ignorant dev team who obviously have no clue what "racing games" can and have offered to the table for maximum enjoyment for everyone.\n\n\n\n\nOn a sidenote, I'm currenty watching the 2015 24 Hours of Le Mans (last 9 hours on Porsche 919 #19 [winning car]) on Youtube and how the guys are handling the corners, and it is IMPOSSIBLE to do their moves on the garbage physics and against the godly AI of Grid. I mean I find it easier to clock fast lap times on my Toyota GT-ONE from GranTurismo facing the hardest AI on La Sarthe for several hours in a row than even finishing one lap on La Sarthe without getting totalled.

Grid puts you to the test in various races that can be difficult, yet entertaining. There are many cars to choose from, and they all function differently. Grid has a fairly generic story that doesn't add or take away anything from the game. The graphics, though from 2008, are fantastic even today and further help to immersie yourself in the game.  Controls work well with a keyboard, but even better with a wheel setup. Grid runs very well on my PC, and it is one of the few racing sims that is able to do so.

The max resolution isn't very high since it's an older title.  1280x**** is about it.  The upside is if you have older equipment it'll play just fine with this game.  The downside is if you have newer equipment, it won't take advantage of it at all.  The graphics are still quite good though.  The actual racing game play is great, the animations are smooth, and the handling of the car is really good too.\n\nWhy don't I recommend this game though?  It has to do with the verbal diarrhea that codemasters apparently likes to put into their racing games.\n\nIf I'm playing a racing game it's because I WANT TO RACE, not be preached to by the game about stuff I could care less about.  What makes it worse is the game forces you to listen to all of it and you can't skip it no matter how hard you try.  Want to quit the game?  Tough!  You've gotta sit through EVERYTHING, watch all the animations, and listen to all the dialog too.  I have Dirt 3 and it suffers from the same dumb problem.  While I'm happy that Codemasters is very proud of all the artwork and dialog that they put into the game, but when you're forced to be a captive audience, it gets under your skin VERY fast.  How annoying is all of this?  Well... when the game wouldn't let me back out of it gracefully and was insistent that I listen to some dope talk to me, I hit the reset button my computer to get out of the game.\n\nAt least with Dirt 3 I got it for free from a video card purchase.  With Grid thankfully I got it on a steam sale and it was really cheap, but with the annoyance factor this game and Dirt 3 present I'm most likely just going to erase this thing from my hard drive and try to forget that I ever played it.  I'm serious, it's THAT annoying!","October 23, 2015","false","0.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

At least on gameplay standpoint.\nI understand this game aimed for somewhere between arcade and simulation, I personally wanted scream and say "make up your mind!"\nThe AI in this game is incredibly aggressive, they will smash into you no matter where you are. It is so ridiculous, even on Touge duel when opponent was behind he kept hitting me causing him to have 3 penalties of 6 seconds. I adjusted the difficulties, and yes eventually AI stopped hitting me but that's only because their top speed is much lower. On many of the standard race where you compete against 11 CPU, good luck. When one guy spins out, usually that leads to mass traffic jam. Key to victory: get top 3 in 1 lap. That was only strategy I could find.\n\nHonestly I was very excited for this game, but I am quite dissapointed. If I wanted to play bumper car then I will get a bumper car game. Don't tell me this is a simulation racing game just because of the physic. Actually, physic is pretty terrible too, unless you turn on assist- your car will spin around like crazy; especially on grass. Again though, since CPU will bang into you so many times you really don't need assist to help youself to spinout.\nThere isn't even a time trial available to practice!! You have to progress into game to unlock time trial (or test drive) appearently.\n\nThey tried, I can tell. But they literally made too many bad decisions all over it's just a mess. Imagine this- you've been told to play gran turismo, but AI plays like burnout. This is it.\n\nDo yourselves a favor and buy Simbin product. I had way more fun than this in about the same price. You could get Need for Speed if you are into arcade style.

You can't enjoy the racing due to that. One little turn and bam you loose, because you have spun off the road,and by the time you can get back on the road the other cars are gone, and the npc's are over powerd as they are programed to be on the track they can not go off the track, they can have damage, but they will never spin off at all. It seemes also that the npc's can not be bumped off the track as well... but they can and do bump you off.

First off I'm in my mid 30's and driven on race tracks multiple times and this game doesn't even come close to how it really feels. I understand this game is not a  sim, instead a more arcade kinda game.\n\nCouple of problem with the game is none of the cars have any weight to them, they all feel like paper cars. I played Iracing and other racing games with my G27 wheel this game has the worst wheel feel.\n\nThey try to make this game hard by doing all the wrong things. Perfect example is Team Raven Crest, instead of making them a challenge because of their driving skills, they instead just give them the fastest car and boosting them a littler more so their car is uncatchable in the category race you're in.\n\nAnother thing they do wrong is how cars react when they come in contact with each other during the race. I don't understand why every time you get hit or you hitting someone from any angel you're the one that is spinning out and the AI just drives off fine.\n\nOverall if you never driven a real car before and under the age of 16 you'll think this game is awesome. For anyone looking for a fair challenge or a driving game that is more close to real life feel this isn't it. If you check all my review I'm normally pretty good on recommending games and never really vote no on recommendation, but this game is a total joke.\n\nSave your money for Project C.A.R.S or Assetto Corsa.","December 17, 2014","false","26.9"," 14 of 31 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","14","31","0","4"

The controlling isn't available through mouse either, making it nearly impossible to be precise with your steering and other manevuers.

The highest difficulty is too easy. Having to start from behind doesn't mean the game is challenging. It's just bugging and compensating the average AI. The AI is too passive. They go out of your way and brake if you get close to them or they get close to you. You can literally drive at 10-20 kmh on those 1on1 tracks and stay easily in front of the opponent and win the race. There is no pathfinding ability in case of a block. For an above average player that's way too easy to exploit.\n\n3. The sponsoring notifications. Oh lord...

Same brakes, same speeding same cornering etc.\n2- Atmosphere: Soundtrack of this game is pretty limited and the selected music makes me feel like playing a very low budget FPS.\n3- AI and some crash physics: While you're following the optimum line for turns you'll find yourself crashed into barriers on insane speeds even the AI racer only hit you slightly. This made the game unplayable especially during global racing for me as higher the speeds, higher damage your car will get from crashing. Also your teammates will see you as a rival driver, as they will occasionally try to corner by crashing into your car. This especially happens when you have a very good teammate.\n4- No multiplayer.\n5- Drifting: Even though I suck at drifting in any racing game, drifting was especially easy for me in GRID, as all I had to do was to drift a little bit near the flags to get insane scores.\n\nRacing at low levels is good, when you get much more faster it's nerve-breaking.

Placing you at the end of the grid doesnt constitute difficulty in any way. The greatest difficulty isn't overtaking or maintainin speed, it is to avoid the AI in any collisions and corners.\nWhich brings me to the most painfull parts of this game; blatant rubberbanding and AI pushing you off the tracks or blocking you from making a corner. Either by randomly hitting the brakes in a corner that can be taken on full throttle or just by tapping your rear end so you can't make the corner.\n\nSadly, I'd still love to give this game a thumbs up but...it's just way more frustrating to play then I can remember.\n","September 2, 2015","false","3.8"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

I've been playing racing games since 16 bit NES and this is one the worst handling games I've ever played. It's just way too tight and there's no way to loosen it. These cars handle like a Hover Round or a riding lawn mower micro car. You drift through all turns, there's very little physics and G force like in a real car. I like muscle cars and very loose steering where I can slide into a turn. I just ran the 1st few tracks maybe it gets better but the only time this car seems to wanna steer straight is into a wall.\n\nI did notice that, when you're headed towards a wall man this thing stays on a line like a champ, if it handled that way in the straights this game would rock I think. But it seems like the walls are giant magnets pulling you into them. And if you try to steer headed towards one, that great tight steering just disappears. Once your car is damaged, you're screwed, restart the race cuz there's no repairs or anyways to fix anything.\n\nI found one way to trick the game when you go into turns is to floor it and 360 your way through the turn but watch the overcompensation on the way out. Like I said, it actually appears to be coded to put you into the wall, so you can kinda fool it this way by just donuting your way thru the turns. It's forcing you to drift.\n\nThis game has much potential, I hear a wheel makes it better but I kinda doubt it if you like old school racing games with a controller. This really is pretty much drifting which I guess is ok but it gets boring pretty fast to me, I prefer living on the edge of G force and that wall, that's actually in Forza. I'll screw around with this game some more probably but if you read get this game if you like Forza...ummm dont, its nothing like Forza at all except there's tracks, cars glitter, sun and crowds.","June 21, 2014","false","2.7"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

But then I tried it with a gamepad, and racing wheel... I noticed that there's a permanent driving assist that helps keep you on the racing line, making it very hard to make mistakes. With a pad or wheel this is frustrating because the road is inconsistent, you get used to a certain amount of steering, but as soon as you deviate from the racing line everything changes. You unintentionally throw your car wildly off the line you want because of it, which is hard when you move to overtake for a corner. It doesn't matter what car or track you're on then, the permanent assists make this as arcade as you can get. Don't mistake this for a simulator, everything about it is fake, even AI crashes are scripted. If you're behind then they slow down, if you're ahead then they speed up by a big margin. My profile can't save anymore, so I can't even progress my game stats.

This was annoying, but I figured fair enough. It gets worse when I went into the game proper.\nFrom what I can see from my own testing and Google searching there is no force feedback in this game. The wheel is constantly loose, and it gets worse.\nThe driving model is very game-y. I came into this thinking it would be, or at least offer the option of a sim experiance, especially since it's tagged on Steam as such. Instead, after turning all driving aids off, I found that I could soar around the track with total ease and little regard for my vehicle.\n\nIf you're after a "game", then this will probably do you fine. I could imagine it would be decent with a gamepad (I haven't tried this yet, though I'm not sure I can be bothered).\nIf, however, you're after a sim, I'd suggest you get yourself a copy of Assetto Corsa instead.\n\nEDIT: I should also mention that it's not the prettiest game.

Yeah...thats kinda how playing GRID felt to my disappointment. Few games for me compare to the feel of "rail racer" like this one does...except maybe some kind of Pokemon Snap on crystal meth. I feel like I'm just along for the ride and am not the least bit important in this whole racing process. The being sick thing isn't meant to be an insult toward the game, in all tunnel-vision, arcadey respects, its a great arcade racing game I suppose.\nI'm more of a simulation racing fan I guess... although I really enjoyed arcade racers like InitialD, that game had a distinct feature that for me, set it far and away in immersion from GRID. That feature would be Buying Parts. To me, there are two things that make a racing game feel like an extension of you, your personal choice of cars, and your personal customization in parts and part settings to those cars.\nGRID starts out on the wrong foot (for the first 3 hours or so) by giving you no permanent choice in the matter by momentarilly mentioning you're a driver and will work for other teams initially. Ok fine... so I finished what amounts to a 3 hour tutorial where I'm driving other peoples cars with seemingly no direction except for which of three global regions the races are in, and then I start to wade through very limited (and seemingly irrelevant) decisions in between races. *sigh*\nAfter about 6 hours. I couldn't care less how much money I'd made, it's only used to buy one particular car for each particular race you enter. Or a selection between two or three cars for each race. Either way, I couldn't have cared less how much money I'd made, how many of this obscure region points I'd earned, or which team this annoying announced kept telling me was somehow more important than the next mindless drone in my way to the finish line...\nHow this game has such a high meta score is ALMOST beyond me. But I do understand its arcade-y appeal. It must not be for me. After dialing in what I think will be the perfect settings for a specific car for a specific class of race, on a specific track, under specific conditions, and making fine adjustments after practice laps of that track...that to me is the process of racing. Not "Heres a car or two, we've already set everything up...just get in it. Its like a roller coaster! Say wheee! And put your arms up...SMILE! PUT YOUR ARMS IN THE AIR AND SMILE!

I love your DiRT games, I like GRID 2, but this just isn't acceptable. Never have I come across a racing game (with the exception of Motorstorm) that gets handling so wrong. Even using an Xbox 360 controller and adjusting the advanced deadzone settings and taking off all assists, the game is barely playable. First of all, the interior view is THE WORST around. Not only can you not see anything because it's letterbox, but it looks bad too in terms of detail. The game starts you off with the fastest cars in the world, and you wonder if the speedometer is accurate or trolling you. There is an unbelievable amount of understeer, and the sense of speed is non-existent. The flashback system is very slow and clunky it's actually quicker to restart the race in some cases. Then there's drifting. If you thought Shift 2 was bad, it isn't it just takes a lot more skill to get used to. In GRID, drifting is unsatisfying and broken. The handbrake in this game is almost useless; although it's probably fairly realistic. There are some good points about this game however. It does away with things that don't really matter, such as customisation and having thousands of cars which nobody will ever use. There is a fair amount of variety in the events and tracks too. Also, you are rewarded for playing the game in a more hardcore manner. Everything from no assists and manual gears to only using interior view and even removing the ability to restart races. The difficulty can be set for each event individually, which is great. Codemasters have definitely understood what hardcore racing game fans care about, but have failed on the most crucial aspect of the game: the driving. It's just wrong and unnatural; whereas GRID 2's is practically perfect fit for everyone. I had high hopes for this game, but the horrible controls and interior view make this difficult to recommend.","November 26, 2013","false","2.3"," 9 of 26 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","9","26","0","0"

Then this is the game for you.\n\nBefore the game is fully loaded you are put in a 650bhp car on a track with no idea how to drive.  You are left mashing the keyboard tying to find the throttle control while the other cars leave you in their dust.  Meanwhile your pit-chief (played by the single most annoying voice actor in the world) is patronising you.  "Well done,  You can finish this race!"\n\nAfter about 20mins you get the option to set your controls and preferences.  Not that is helps much as most preferences seem to be track specific and need to be changed very single race.\n\nThe lack of practice laps and qualifying means you are dropped in the deep end in every race.  The challenge of the game is in learning the tracks rather than going fast as the AI for the most part is quite slow.  That is until you get a team mate.  Your team mate is only ever good at one style of racing, but in that style they become your biggest rival, often costing you the race.\n\nIt's a damn shame.  This game has a really nice driving engine and the sponsorship deals are a great idea, but they don't make up for all the flaws that the developers seem to think are features.  I hope I never have to listen to that pit chief again for the rest of my life.","November 27, 2013","false","20.6"," 9 of 26 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","9","26","0","0"

Still maybe somebody's looking to grab it, on sale or otherwise, so hopefully this won't be totally useless.\n\nBasically, you would want to have this game if (and i'm quite afraid that ONLY IF) you're a fan of racing bikes against trains. The game puts you, a player, into a race with drivers from, seemingly, another universe, with different physic laws, different understanding of what "smart" is, and so on. The outcomes of collisions here are ridiculous. A head on at around 200 kph would result (well, quite reasonably) in your car being smashed quite heavy. For opponent it would result in slight trajectory adjustment, and he'll head on towards the finish happily. A slightest touch in the corner would mean you're thrown off the track. And if it's you who suddenly crashes into the back of NPC car... well, bad news because it's you again who's thrown off. I was mentioning the trains, right?\n\nAnd the AI is just brilliant. Its best performance so far is having your partner smack you in the back and kick you off the track while you're trying to cruise smoothly towards the end of in-game 24h of Le Mahn event.\n\nSo really, don't get this game. Unless, of course, you like to ride bikes vs trains.","December 6, 2013","false","20.7"," 5 of 18 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","5","18","0","0"

I can understand the degree of understeer that goes with driving cars close to their limits, but when the AI driving the same car does not exhibit the same limitations, then there's a problem.  As for the useless track HUD, I often have to do a dry run to learn some the track's idiosyncracies and then restart the race in order to have a fighting chance.  In DiRT 2, at least the track HUD is decent and the AI feels just as constrained to the world's physics and cars' limitations as the player, resulting in a far more enjoyable experience than what is offered here.","December 26, 2013","false","1.7"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","4","16","0","0"

They are the most accurate reviews you'll see on the whole page. The cars are uncontrollable and make zero sense.\n\nYou are literally thrown into a sports car and told to finish the race, regardless of what position you are, which I thought was just a joke (or some sort of 'don't worry, you'll get better' scenario for the newbies.) Having platinumed Gran Turismo 5, I was ready for it. That is until you try and take a corner at 30 mph and your car spins out of control and spirals around 3 times, and you're suddenly last. Or if you want to take the corner at 10 mph, and your car spins out of control and spirals around 3 times and you're suddenly last. Or if you want to drift around the corner, and your car spins out of control....\n\nBasically, the car just does not understand physics or how a car actually drives. I've taken a corner at 30 mph in real life, and I can confirm for you, my car does not spiral around the road like a marble. This is if you're lucky enough to not collide with a single person the entire race, if you do, your car may as well be 'blasting off again' ala Team Rocket from Pokémon.\n\nSIDE NOTE :: If you use MotioninJoy to use PS3 controller, do not try it. The screen flickers uncontrollably and will either give you a seizure; break your concentration; or annoy the crap out of you.\n\nWhatever you're willing to pay for this game, it is too much.

Not the same physics so you can't do the things you can in this game (like make the other cars crash by ramming them)\n\n2. GRID 2 tells you "there is damage to your car", this game tells you where (which wheel, transmition, engine, etc) and how much.\n\n3. GRID 2 feels really linear, this one gives you a bunch of options on where and how you want to race.\n\nDONT BUY GRID 2, BUY GRID 1 FOR MUCH LESS\n\nand hopefully the creators will pick up that they started to head down the wrong road.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arbayer2/recommended/12750/","arbayer2","arbayer2 <BCI/TBfB>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arbayer2/","393 products in account","I originally saw Race Driver: Grid on YouTube. Much like many modern gamers, its uncountable number of Let's Plays and playthroughs showed me at the time that it was one of the most immersive racing games I could get for the PC. Needless to say, I eventually broke down and bought it. This review is solely the experience I've had after having played it (when I could) over the past few years.\n\n(If you're wondering about the (relatively extremely short) hour count I have on the Steam version, most of my time was spent on a non-Steam version years ago. Long story short I lost that copy and repurchased it on here a few months ago, hence the lack of hours logged. You don't need too many hours on the Steam version to know it's buggy, though... More on that later.)\n\nGrid, some say, took the Dirt series and put it on asphalt. What there was in this game was mostly appealing; beautiful graphics, an excellent variety of cars, complete with dramatic damage models and high-definition, animated vehicle interiors on world-famous (and other fictional) tracks. The vehicles are extremely detailed in both visual and aural design, including the whine of the turbocharger, the clunk of the E-brake and pedals, the intense screeching scrape of trading paint with the track wall or another driver and the unsettling whirring and whining of the steering linkage after one too many collisions.\n\nInitially, I found it difficult to learn how exactly to drive in-game, as at the time I only had a keyboard/mouse setup instead of an Xbox 360 controller (which, essentially, the game was originally designed for, that or a racing wheel... you can use a mouse and keyboard but in my experience you've got your work cut out for you in terms of handling. I don't have a racing wheel, can't judge that). The AI is quite challenging for that of a racing game in my opinion; your mileage may vary but it's difficult enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, while irritating you to no end should you have to restart a race due to being slammed into the wall or aggressively shoved between other competitors like a hot potato... made of metal, rubber, fabric, plastic and glass... with an exploding engine inside it. What a visceral experience, at least!\n\nThere was also a (fairly popular as I recall) online multiplayer mode in which you could buy and sell cars to each other (via a virtual eBay Motors, apparently... in-game advertising at its finest) and compete in races across the world. There were several planned DLC, including new cars, multiplayer race events and tracks. Even the singleplayer events were awesome: gymkhana-style drifting challenges, circuit racing, touge (a relay-style race on windy mountain roads from start-to-finish-to-start in two laps against one competitor).\n\nThere was a novel gameplay mechanic Grid introduced called Flashback, where in the event of a crash you can "rewind" a race to before the crash occurred to give yourself a few extra chances to complete it. There's nothing quite as cathartic as taking a turn apex at 190 mph, hopping into the air off a rumble strip, smashing through a tire barricade and three other cars and coming to a rest pancaked against the track wall... knowing you have three Flashbacks left!\n\nYou could create a virtual racing team, hire drivers and leverage their talent to give yourself a chance at dethroning some of the best drivers in the world. There was even a (time-compressed, obviously) simulation of the world-famous 24 Hours of Le Mans championship, an endurance race in which you have to fight your way to the head of the pack and avoid crashing for 24 minutes straight. Outside of all of this, the game's modding community allowed you to edit your own cars... although, because of a lack of research, I can't exactly say to what extent you could modify or replace vehicle models for sure.\n\nThe above is why I loved this game despite all its flaws.\n\nThese days, however, I see the game from a different, more critical perspective. Due to it being succeeded by sequels including Grid 2 and Grid: Autosport, it seems apparent that Codemasters have long since given up on maintaining support for the original Grid. Several game-hampering, if not game-breaking, bugs still exist, including some which cause framerate stuttering, the game's audio to loop unexpectedly (a problem I personally have NEVER gotten rid of, even after reinstalling, messing around with my game files to prevent the Flashback system file from ballooning to several gigabytes in size and disabling hardware audio rendering) and even random crashes to desktop.\n\nI've even read on Grid's Steam Community forums that some players' computers restart randomly after the game crashes -- but that's their word, not mine, this has never happened to me. The online multiplayer servers have long since been shut down entirely, inexplicably over a year before Grid 2's release, thus rendering the entire multiplayer mode broken -- albeit, according to Wikipedia, only for PS3 and PC, the Xbox 360 version's multiplayer may still be *ahem* Live. Not to mention that one of the promised DLC packs was never actually released. I got into the game far too late to actually purchase any of the DLC, so it's not necessarily something I'll miss as much, but it's still fairly disappointing. Even the game's support website has been removed - last time I checked, Codemasters' site only had support and forums for Grid 2 and Autosport unless I'm mistaken, which I could very well be.\n\nThe worst part is, in my opinion this was the best Grid ever, the finest game yet in the franchise. There are many great features in the sequels, but for me personally I loved the immersion more than any other feature, which makes Codemasters' idiotic decision to completely remove the cockpit mode from Grid 2 and put it back in in Autosport with cockpits not nearly as detailed as those in a game six years old somewhat painful. I'm still not sure I'll ever come back to this franchise, as at this point in time there's honestly better racers dedicated to arcade gameplay AND simulation, especially on Steam, putting the Grid franchise in a position of questionable purpose.\n\nThere are many reasons for me to recommend this game and many for me to warn you that you might be wasting your money. I've outlined most of them, but here's a brief recap:\n\nPros:\n-Beautiful, immersive vehicles, environments and audio\n-A wide variety of vehicles, environments and challenges\n-Then-popular online multiplayer and vehicle trading features\n-A fairly-decent (by today's standards, at least) example of early DLC\n-Very well-received, averaging 87% for all platforms on Metacritic (if you really believe in that sort of thing)\n-Some degree of end-user modifications!\n-Racing wheel and Xbox 360 controller support... in a racing game... thank you.\n-Fairly detailed level of customizable handling for peripherals\n\nCons:\n-Numerous unresolved, unavoidable, game-breaking bugs in PC version which at best harm immersion and at worst temporarily destabilize your computer... apparently? YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nadrojiskool/recommended/12750/","nadrojiskool","Nadrojiskool","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nadrojiskool/","1046 products in account","I tried the demo for this game not too long after it came out on Xbox. I love racing games and rarely dislike any that I play. Within the first couple minutes of playing that demo I was completely dumbfounded by how irritated I was with this game. GRID has quite possibly the worst driving mechanics of any racing game I've ever played.\n\nI spent the first two tiers of the career trying to get used to the ridiculously touchy steering and breaking, and had finally come to actually quite enjoy it. Most specifically, I suppose, I enjoyed driving the open wheel cars. The handling of the open wheel cars is fantastic and I figured I'd repeat them for a few seasons just because they were easy money. I was hoping that there would be an open wheel series in one of the top tier licenses, but there wasn't in the one I unlocked,\n\nDespite this, I finally decided to jump into some of the higher level races so I could earn a bit more cash since I'd just wasted 10mil on a car for Le Mans last season. I spent my remaining 3mil on the only car available for the GT1 series and hired a better driver because I was tired of my previous driver always finishing last (outside of open wheel races).\n\nIt didn't take more than a minute for me to realize this wasn't going to work. No matter how hard I tried to be cautious through the corners, I would end up bouncing off the walls, or other cars, without fail. After having gotten used to the ultra-loose controls of all the other cars to that point, this car went around corners like a GD brick.\n\nIt was at this point that I remembered the original feeling I had when I playing the demo. I had also gotten irritated by how the cars had driven in other previous events, especially around Le Mans, but my enjoyment of the open wheel series had distracted me from that fact. Plus, after I finished my first race at Le Mans, I set the difficulty on "Even A Child Can Do It" every time I did it after that because I couldn't be bothered to waste time on a higher difficulty.\n\nWhile you might be able to find a car, like I did, that you can get comfortable driving, almost all of the races are pretty specific on which cars you can choose. On top of that, there is an extremely limited number of tracks which are used over, and over, and over. Which is partially what made that GT1 car so infurriating. I had raced on that track in pretty much every other series I had been in, so I knew it quite well, and was still unable to get the car to get around the track without the race turning into bumper cars.\n\nI should also mention that the AI are especially terrible as well as unbalanced. Even on the second to hardest difficulty they constantly spin out, run into you, brake way too early, take terrible lines and speed through corners and get in your way. Your team mate AI is even worse because mine finished last in every single race but a couple when the event wasn't his specialty. There was even one event where he would get in a wreck so I would restart the race except he kept wrecking every time. I eventually gave up and let him get his DNF.\n\nThe new driver I hired who was much better than my previous one was just as bad. He simply stayed in the position he started in and was just an 8th place waste of space. Not that I did much better, since this was the GT1 series and if I wasn't into the wall and totalled I was trying my best to race by myself and catch up to the driver in front of me, with no success.\n\nIn the end, I don't think I could recommend this game to anybody. While it seems like a decent enough game, somewhere around a 8/10 if you don't knock it much for the lack of tracks and cars and the fact that it's a little dated, I just absolutely don't see the point. It's honestly worth a shot if you get the game on deep discount or in a bundle, but you have my warning.","March 23, 2015","false","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The cars handle very nicely and intuitively, with oversteer and understeer very predictable to controllable. The assists make for a very accessible experience, but turn them off and its a different tale, with more powerful cars becoming somewhat of a handful.\n\nVisuals can hold their own against more modern titles with ease, and the EGO engine will run beautifully even on older hardware.\n\nNo real negative, only thing it the DLC was never released for PC, but a quick Google search will completely resolve that ;)","September 23, 2014","true","33.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arbayer2/recommended/12750/","arbayer2","arbayer2 <BCI/TBfB>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arbayer2/","393 products in account","I originally saw Race Driver: Grid on YouTube. Much like many modern gamers, its uncountable number of Let's Plays and playthroughs showed me at the time that it was one of the most immersive racing games I could get for the PC. Needless to say, I eventually broke down and bought it. This review is solely the experience I've had after having played it (when I could) over the past few years.\n\n(If you're wondering about the (relatively extremely short) hour count I have on the Steam version, most of my time was spent on a non-Steam version years ago. Long story short I lost that copy and repurchased it on here a few months ago, hence the lack of hours logged. You don't need too many hours on the Steam version to know it's buggy, though... More on that later.)\n\nGrid, some say, took the Dirt series and put it on asphalt. What there was in this game was mostly appealing; beautiful graphics, an excellent variety of cars, complete with dramatic damage models and high-definition, animated vehicle interiors on world-famous (and other fictional) tracks. The vehicles are extremely detailed in both visual and aural design, including the whine of the turbocharger, the clunk of the E-brake and pedals, the intense screeching scrape of trading paint with the track wall or another driver and the unsettling whirring and whining of the steering linkage after one too many collisions.\n\nInitially, I found it difficult to learn how exactly to drive in-game, as at the time I only had a keyboard/mouse setup instead of an Xbox 360 controller (which, essentially, the game was originally designed for, that or a racing wheel... you can use a mouse and keyboard but in my experience you've got your work cut out for you in terms of handling. I don't have a racing wheel, can't judge that). The AI is quite challenging for that of a racing game in my opinion; your mileage may vary but it's difficult enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, while irritating you to no end should you have to restart a race due to being slammed into the wall or aggressively shoved between other competitors like a hot potato... made of metal, rubber, fabric, plastic and glass... with an exploding engine inside it. What a visceral experience, at least!\n\nThere was also a (fairly popular as I recall) online multiplayer mode in which you could buy and sell cars to each other (via a virtual eBay Motors, apparently... in-game advertising at its finest) and compete in races across the world. There were several planned DLC, including new cars, multiplayer race events and tracks. Even the singleplayer events were awesome: gymkhana-style drifting challenges, circuit racing, touge (a relay-style race on windy mountain roads from start-to-finish-to-start in two laps against one competitor).\n\nThere was a novel gameplay mechanic Grid introduced called Flashback, where in the event of a crash you can "rewind" a race to before the crash occurred to give yourself a few extra chances to complete it. There's nothing quite as cathartic as taking a turn apex at 190 mph, hopping into the air off a rumble strip, smashing through a tire barricade and three other cars and coming to a rest pancaked against the track wall... knowing you have three Flashbacks left!\n\nYou could create a virtual racing team, hire drivers and leverage their talent to give yourself a chance at dethroning some of the best drivers in the world. There was even a (time-compressed, obviously) simulation of the world-famous 24 Hours of Le Mans championship, an endurance race in which you have to fight your way to the head of the pack and avoid crashing for 24 minutes straight. Outside of all of this, the game's modding community allowed you to edit your own cars... although, because of a lack of research, I can't exactly say to what extent you could modify or replace vehicle models for sure.\n\nThe above is why I loved this game despite all its flaws.\n\nThese days, however, I see the game from a different, more critical perspective. Due to it being succeeded by sequels including Grid 2 and Grid: Autosport, it seems apparent that Codemasters have long since given up on maintaining support for the original Grid. Several game-hampering, if not game-breaking, bugs still exist, including some which cause framerate stuttering, the game's audio to loop unexpectedly (a problem I personally have NEVER gotten rid of, even after reinstalling, messing around with my game files to prevent the Flashback system file from ballooning to several gigabytes in size and disabling hardware audio rendering) and even random crashes to desktop.\n\nI've even read on Grid's Steam Community forums that some players' computers restart randomly after the game crashes -- but that's their word, not mine, this has never happened to me. The online multiplayer servers have long since been shut down entirely, inexplicably over a year before Grid 2's release, thus rendering the entire multiplayer mode broken -- albeit, according to Wikipedia, only for PS3 and PC, the Xbox 360 version's multiplayer may still be *ahem* Live. Not to mention that one of the promised DLC packs was never actually released. I got into the game far too late to actually purchase any of the DLC, so it's not necessarily something I'll miss as much, but it's still fairly disappointing. Even the game's support website has been removed - last time I checked, Codemasters' site only had support and forums for Grid 2 and Autosport unless I'm mistaken, which I could very well be.\n\nThe worst part is, in my opinion this was the best Grid ever, the finest game yet in the franchise. There are many great features in the sequels, but for me personally I loved the immersion more than any other feature, which makes Codemasters' idiotic decision to completely remove the cockpit mode from Grid 2 and put it back in in Autosport with cockpits not nearly as detailed as those in a game six years old somewhat painful. I'm still not sure I'll ever come back to this franchise, as at this point in time there's honestly better racers dedicated to arcade gameplay AND simulation, especially on Steam, putting the Grid franchise in a position of questionable purpose.\n\nThere are many reasons for me to recommend this game and many for me to warn you that you might be wasting your money. I've outlined most of them, but here's a brief recap:\n\nPros:\n-Beautiful, immersive vehicles, environments and audio\n-A wide variety of vehicles, environments and challenges\n-Then-popular online multiplayer and vehicle trading features\n-A fairly-decent (by today's standards, at least) example of early DLC\n-Very well-received, averaging 87% for all platforms on Metacritic (if you really believe in that sort of thing)\n-Some degree of end-user modifications!\n-Racing wheel and Xbox 360 controller support... in a racing game... thank you.\n-Fairly detailed level of customizable handling for peripherals\n\nCons:\n-Numerous unresolved, unavoidable, game-breaking bugs in PC version which at best harm immersion and at worst temporarily destabilize your computer... apparently? YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY... Heh, racing jokes\n-Multiplayer mode hastily discontinued\n-Official customer support non-existent, hastily discontinued\n-Sequels take the same formula and remove entire features unexpectedly... the entire series, it seems, has been trying to reinvent itself by force, for better or worse\n-Incomplete DLC release (gee, kinda like another racing game I liked a lot... *ahem*BurnoutParadise*ahem*)\n\nEDIT: 9/25/2014: I'm going to change my mind on my previous verdict and say that despite all its flaws (and in light of the fact that GameRanger can perhaps replace multiplayer and I finally learned that the audio glitch may have been caused by a peripheral), Grid is a very competent game that, if you can run it smoothly, will probably satisfy your racing/immersion urges if you're into beautiful visuals and arcade fun.\n\nFinal verdict: a flawed gem\n\n7.9/10","September 23, 2014","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

The cars in the game have an immense amount of grip compared to other racing games (but still feels natural), this adds to the sense of speed the game already provides when you're able to zip around corners along with other race cars (More so if you race in the first person perspective like I do in this game).\n\nFrom my standpoint, I like to race clean and try not to hit other cars and the AI in this game is very responsive to where you are in relation to where they are, there are few situations where the AI just straight up runs into you. If you cut into their racing line, they will for the most part, respond very swiftly and try to avoid crashing to you. AI provides a very good challenge.\n\nExcellent game in general, for a racing fan like me it's a nice mix between arcade and simulation.

It was kind of frustrating at first and did seem a bit, dare I say, overhyped, but then as I played along I soon got a hang of it and it didn't seem like I had to give a 110% to win a race. The gameplay does sink in but it takes a bit of practice to get the hang of driving in GRID because the controls and feedback are so realistic. So, yes, after all this gameplay it does not at all seem overrated because its fun to play and you do get that sense of accomplishment once you win a race :) . Now as for the graphics    - the level of detail that the game designers have put into it is just astounding - and I mean for the important bits like car damage (more on that later), the amount of correction in anti-aliasing and other factors like lighting (for example, the accuracy with which the angle of sunlight coming through the windows changes in the cockpit when the car turns). For car damage I have to brag on a little more - its one of the most realistic that I have seen in any game of the racing genre besides titles like Burnout Paradise. For example as you drive over gravel or grass the dirt and scratches show up on your car! Now another gem of a feature that GRID features is replaying the footage of a race at the end of that race. You can play and win an extremely hard match and marvel every time at how you won that impossibility over and over in that replay, over pop corn and soda. How cool is that? One catch though - you can't save any of those footage for later use unless you've got a video capture utility (hardware or software like Nvidia's ShadowPlay). Coming to the in-game characteristics now, there is a wide selection of tracks and quite a good amount of cars (though they could have added a few more - just my opinion) that the game hosts and the AI or artificial intelligence is pretty darn good (be expected to be swerved out by your fellow opponents indirectly). So if you ask my opinion, it's a must buy. Hope I helped :)","December 21, 2013","true","144.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The race modes are a good mix of hectic sideways action (drift events) and precision apex driving (GT1/2). It sits in that happy little place between arcade and simulator.\n\nBut it isn't perfect. Here are some things I found damn annoying:\nTechnical Issues:\n- The pit crew guy that constantly provides updates has a damn annoying voice. Unfortunately you can't turn him off in a useful way. You can reduce the voice volume, but this also means reducing you crew mate/racer who actually says useful things. Also, if you turn down the voice volume, you still get sound dipping of race/engine sounds when he communicates... even though he is muted. Crazy right.\n- The AI crashes, sometimes the AI will spin out in a corner. Fine, it happens. But, the way it happens is pretty much their car jumps to the side a metre or so and then they lose it. Maybe the hand of God?\n\nPersonal Opinion:\n- Need for Speed: The Run had a totally epic race challenge called 'Porsche Attack' it's a 6 minute point-to-point time trial up a series of hairpins to the top of a mountain, then a fast open hillside into an epic flowing downhill decent. Anyone who has played that level knows what I'm talking about. Grid has nothing like that. Generally the tracks are very flat and don't have much character. There is no feeling, no adrenaline, no "wow, this is awesome" just clinical & controlled racetracks. It may be enough for some, but I was a little disappointed.","December 15, 2013","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The car models are really nice and the damage model convincing.\n\nIt holds up as a very challenging game which keeps you gripped and on the edge of your seat.\n\nThose who comment on poor handling clearly need to learn how to break before corners and think like a real racer.\n\nI loved this game on xbox 360 and enjoyed many hours online, playing it on pc means I can enjoy the way it really was intended to look, and that is stunning.\n\nMy only gripe really is with Codemasters shutting off the servers and not patching the game to allow people to run their own servers, so no online play. Saying that there are methods of still playing it online by using 3rd party apps, however I have found them to be a bit hit and miss, sometimes resulting in a good connection with other players, but then the connection randomly dropping for no reason. Real shame.\n\nStill single player is fun and very challenging, if your a petrol head and don`t mind just playing single player, or want to try the alternate methods of playing online I recommend this game. To be honest I prefer this original Grid to the sequel, which in my opinion lost some of its spark and challenge, not to mention the loss of the Destruction Derby part which was always hugely popular (shame on you Codemasters).","February 1, 2014","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The two games are very similar and appear to run on the same base engine.  Grid has just the right balance of arcade and real world physics to make the game difficult but not frustrating, making races fun time and again.  I particularly like the "Flashback" feature (also featured in Dirt 2), allowing you to use instant replay to teleport back a few seconds in time and retry a botched turn or avoid a crash.  I use the feature sparingly bc sometimes it feels like cheating, but it can also be the difference between a race being fun and being maddening.\n\nPick it up on sale, GRID is a fantastic game!

As has been mentioned, it finds that perfect sweet spot between "arcade" racing and hard-core simulation and just goes flat out with it. The sheer variety in gameplay is also impressive. The tracks range from tight, city-based runs to wide-open racetracks to mountain roads, most with variations; the cars all handle quite differently, from open-wheel to stock to supercars; and the events can be straight laps, drift, downhill, demolition, and more. Even the same tracks can feel quite different when equipped with different classes of cars. The career mode is also lots of fun, ramping up the challenge in an appropriate way. Acquiring and managing new cars and sponsors was more fun than I expected.\n\nI'm no racing guy, but it's amazing how much more of an experience this is from arcade-drive-gaming. It's the perfect combination of challenging and forgiving, and lots and lots of in-the-zone fun.

To say the least, for a game I snagged through Humble Bundle, I wasn't expecting such a smoothe feel to the game and such a nice aesthetic.\n+Gameplay: Had to use X360ce to get my logitech contoller to work with it, but once I did, man, the game feels great.\n+Easy to get into: I crashed my car like a 100x's before I finally remembered how to play a damn racing game, but that was because of my lack of skill and not how easy it was to just start and play the game.\n+Voice Acting: Really smoothe voice acting! I was a bit freaked out at first when they called me by my name...but I remembered the option to choose your nick name, and, yea. Is pretty nice addition\n\nThe Bad:\n-No controller support besides 360: So, the 360 controller is supported standard. Anything else you need to use a workaround like 360ce.

Still my favorite racing sim, even over Dirt 2 and GT5.\n\nWhile there is no off-road in this game, the variety is subtle but there, surfaces of uneven city streets, to cobblestone, to race grade asphalt. The cars span stock muscle, import tuners, exotic concepts and supercars. As you progress you unlock different varieties of racing such as drift races, Toge on Japanese mountains, and LeMans endurance races. Finally, where I have been most impressed is GRID's use of force feedback with the Driving Force GT steering wheel, which to me is above and beyond even GT5's own implementation on PS3, and provides a better experience than Dirt 2's soft surfaces.","March 4, 2012","true","78.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have played this game, completed all events, albeit once.  I found this game to be challenging and a lot of fun.  Buying various cars dedicated for specific events encouraged you to play the game.  It created a sense of immersion.\n\nAlso, by increasing the difficulty level and turning off various options before the race granted you extra reputation and or credits, which I found very rewarding and welcome.\n\nGraphicswise the game looks pretty, tracks are well modeled, do not ask me if historically correct I am not a huge fan of tracks themselves.  Controlling your vehicle by any means possible is doable, I mean few races using the wheel and you become your machine's daddy.  One of the things I miss in Grid 2 is lack of cockpit view, which the original Grid does have.  Detailed interiors make driving your car an exciting, pleasant, realistic experience.  Once you get into it, the 3rd person view becomes obsolete, despised.  Being behind the wheel, this is how you play this game.\n\nThe AI is also good.  Many drivers have different playstyle, some are aggressive others are calm.  Yes, the AI can also crash their vehicles, by example I entered a race and 10 cars out of 20 crashed.  I believe the difficulty level gives AI buffs, does not make it drive better, but I am not sure in 100%.  Game is challenging on all diff levels.  Sometimes even Medium can give you a lot of trouble.\n\nCareer is also well built, with a series of events with many race types, car classes and requirements.  The narrator (the guy who talks to you during races) is also good, better than in Grid 2.  He informs you about different events during the game.  For example, when someone crashes or when your car takes damage which should not be ignored.\n\nI could talk ages, one way or another, get this game.  It has no paid DLC and it is a lot of fun.","July 17, 2015","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, there are plenty of reviews you could read that would go into specifics in much greater (and better) detail than I myself could or would.\n\nI wanted to let everyone know the way to get 1080 (or any resolution you can run) properly, as I know I was unable when first booting up the game.\n\nBaseline (Widescreen) Solution & Issues\nNative.\n\nThere is a setting to select the screen aspect ratio. The default setting is "Normal", an auto mode that always follows the current resolution's AR.\nSelecting a specific ratio will stretch the screen to match the selection. Ratios available: 4:3, 5:4, 16:10, 16:9, 5:3.\n\nAn important thing to note is that the game does not support resolutions above 1440x900 and 1280x1024 if a graphic card with less than 512mb is detected. The game might incorrectly detect the amount of vram when using newer graphics cards, which will lock you out of using higher resolutions. Follow these steps to solve this problem:\n\n1) Look for your hardware_settings_restrictions.xml file in your 'system' folder (default for steam version: C:\Steam\steamapps\common\grid\system\), and make a backup.\n\n2) Open the file with Notepad. Scroll down to the bottom, remove the following entry and save the file:\n\ndata\nres mem="270" maxWidth="1280"\n/data\n\nThe restriction is now gone and you can play the game at your native resolution.\n\nThis is from http://www.wsgf.org/dr/race-driver-grid , and I had no input, but I wanted everyone else to know the fix in case they were like me and about to un-install an otherwise wonderful game.","December 18, 2013","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, after playing a small amount of both Sims and Arcade style racers, I find the balance between the two in this game.\n\nThe thing that I really like about this game is that the right balance of that arcade and sim just work wonders for me, even with arcade like settings you can easily oversteer and land yourself in the grass next to the track, almost surely dooming you to lose the race.\n\nIt's not a game for those who like Need for Speed's customization, but there is a little paint modification available here. This game has a pretty wide variety of races, though they could have had more tracks. One of my favorites being the Midnight Togue. The number of cars is no where near say Gran Turismo, but it has a decent amount.\n\nAll in all, this is probably one of the best racing games I've ever played, and definitely worth the reasonable price.","April 6, 2011","true","31.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not really much to say here apart from that its the best racing game I've seen in many years. Graphics, Cars, replayability, its all in there and what's even better than all that combined? The "retry" system. Never again will you have to restart an entire race based on one little mistake... Now you just hit the replay mid-race hit a button and wham, you can retry that mistake you just made.\n\nOf course that changes with the Difficulty and hardcore arcade racers will have a pretty harsh time making their raceline work for them. Apart from that, casuals will have their work cut out also, making this, apart from DiRt 2, the best arcade race on steam right now.\n\nGraphics are fresh, clear and detailed enough to make it a believable experience.

The graphics, the gameplay, the realism, everything is in it's place and balanced perfectly in a way that you can only love this game, or hate it. I don't give it a higher note because when you start playing it, it feels so damn hard. I mean, for me, was something like I never played, it was hard as hell to start winning.

I would give this game an 8/10 just because they give you specific cars you can choose from each race but definitely still fun and addicting nonetheless. Oh, and also the ability to customize your team with the branding, what sponsors it has, and the teammates to choose from give this game an added benefit towards its score for me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rodrows/recommended/12750/","Rodrows","Rodrows","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rodrows/","133 products in account","A challenging and engaging racing game\n\nThe driving in this game is more on the simulator end of the spectrum, although there are some arcade aspects as well (let's say 75% sim, 25% arcade). It never feels bad to be behind the wheel but there's some getting used to in the beginning. The game has a flashback system (limited according to your difficulty level) in case you make some mistakes, and I found the AI somewhat forgiving on Hard, but that might just be me. If you find the right balance of challenge for a race the experience can be quite thrilling.\n\nThe game doesn't have a story per se, but you do have a career mode that has you starting from a freelance driver and building and managing your own team (including hiring sponsors and teammates) to conquer championships all around the world. The races are divided into European, American and Japanese leagues, each with its own license points system that keeps you from accessing the top races right away. Depending on your driving skills and your difficulty settings it can be either a moderately long journey or a month's work to beat it.\n\nThe car engines are for the most part distinct, although there's not an instantly recogniseable car based on engine sound alone. The sound effects from crases and tire screeching are very well made and the placement is perfect, especially when listening from the inside of the car. In every race your pit engineer keeps you informed of most of the developments around you, both the ones you can see (or participate in) and the ones you don't. Your teammates make comments from time to time as well. I played this a couple of months before writing this and I don't remember if the game's soundtrack is good or not, but I do remember muting it for a better immersion or to play my own and not having any regrets.\n\nThe game requires some tweaking to fully enjoy the visuals on PC, like removing the yellowish filter that carried over from the console releases and a few texture upgrades to make the cars really shine. The tracks don't need much improvement and the skyboxes look pretty natural as they are. Regarding the cars, every one has a fully rendered interior (unlike the sequels).\n\nOverall, a very very solid racing game that can perfectly stand up to today's releases, and for the most part outclass them.","January 12, 2015","true","24.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Being a fan of F1 2010+13 (100% simulation) and Ridge Racer 7 (100% arcade) I was pleased to find that there's something in the middle. I must admit that in the beginning I didn't like the steering/driving feeling, but after a while you get used to it and it's just fine.\nIt's also good that since it's an older game it has lower system requirements than later installments but still it has very nice graphics and sound.\nThe career mode is fine for me as is the simple "racing day".\nAll in all it's an entertaining racing game in the middle between sim and arcade, which can be played in older machines, which looks, sounds and plays nice. One more plus is its low price.\n\nThe only minus is that there's no split-screen mode...\n\nRecommended!","January 26, 2015","true","42.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have to get this out of my system. This game was fun at first. I guess it was quite fun for a reasonably long time even, but towards the end I've just started despising it, and just don't even want to finish. There are just a couple of things that ♥♥♥♥ me off way too much.\n\n1. The difficulty system sucks. First of all, the difficulty level raises too much towards the end. Naturally a game's difficulty should be raising as you're getting better and as the game progresses, but it should be raising gradually and not too steeply. Neither is the case here. All of a sudden when you're at the global league or whatever it's called, you're wondering if you accidentally cranked the difficulty level up a couple of notches. But you didn't, this is just how the game decided to up the challenge. A ♥♥♥♥ load at once.\n\nSecondly, the difficulty comes from the wrong things. You see, at the start grid they always place you near the end, and the best NPCs always start from the front. And then the guys between you and the people you really want to win drive slow as snails, while preventing you from passing. Also, many of the tracks are so narrow that it's not so easy to pass in the first place. So for the first couple of laps you'll be trying to get past the snails while hoping the big boys haven't gotten too big of a head start, and then for the last laps you'll be desperately trying to catch up. And if you do catch up, the computer of course finds a turbo setting in their car, and makes it go a little bit, but noticeably, faster than yours. If you manage to pass them, they will never fall far behind. No matter if you caught up to them by consistently driving laps several seconds faster than them, they'll now miraculously find a bit more speed and keep up. Their better car (even when it's the same F3 you all have) makes sure they're in the position to overtake, too. None of this amuses me.\n\n2. Music is bad.\n\n3. Voice acting is not great, and the lines they tell are obnoxious. Once I was considerably behind from my teammate, who had informed me that he is leading the race. My business partner or whoever that guy is, also informed me that it's my teammate who is ahead of me. Then my teammate told me he can see me right behind him, when clearly he couldn't see me, because I was not on the same straight as he was. A bit later I caught up to him and passed him, and he then informed me that he is right behind me. He also informed me that he's on the second position. He then went on to assure me that he "has my back". In the next corner he bumped into me and made me crash into the wall.\n\n4. Your teammate is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. He barely benefits you at all. Most of the time he'll just be in your way or crashing into you. When you finally manage to overtake him, he apparently loses all interest and doesn't even try to make life harder for your opponents. Or meet the sponsor goals.\n\n5. And what the ♥♥♥♥ is up with the sponsor system anyway? You have to go check and rearrange your sponsors after every race, because maybe you just got a new sponsor that gives more money than one of your previous sponsors. That's some tedious, annoying micro management that doesn't serve any purpose and isn't relevant to anything. It's just there to advertise the companies, I guess, which is lame.\n\n♥♥♥♥ this game.","January 26, 2015","false","27.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every car you own actually has milage and you can watch it ticking up as you're blazing down the track. You can even buy used cars from 'Ebay'. The AI is fantastic. This may be the first racing game where I've seen cpu drivers actually spin out of the curve and crash. Physics are amazing! My very first race I hit a bump and went flying upside down through the air.  There is realistic damage in the game but you can use a short flashback to fix your mistake. These are very limited and short and not game-breaking at all.\n\nThe campaign is style is very nice letting you pick different regions to play in and purchase whichever eligible cars you want to compete in.\n\nThe longer the game goes the better gets as you unlock and choose your own sponsors on your car all with bonus objectives you can pick for extra cash as well as having YOUR OWN TEAM! You actually get to hire drivers as teammates to back you up in the race. Each with their own personality and driving style.

I am proud to say that it is certainly one of the better racers that have graced the pc and the console, the cars handle well, tracks feel genuine, the announcers comments can be a bit corny every now and then, there isn't so much as an upgrade system like there is in say the old "need for speed" games, but  being able to buy cars either new or used from(in game) Ebay feels satisfactory,  it feels like you've acheived something. The track announcer  keep you up to date with who's leading, who's had a crash and so forth, your  manager standing on the side lines giving telling you the condition of your car, which also accompenied by a wonderful HUD with how fast you're going, what position your in, how bad the damage on the car is and all to be topped off with a wonderful map so planning your turns/drifts are a must if you wish to survive.\n\nBefore each race you have the choice of setting how difficult, wether you want to use the rewind feature and how often(or less), along with the standard automatic manual gear change.\n\nNow that the good has been said there's not to much bad to say really about this game, a part from that drifting with actual drifting cars might feel abit more slippery then it needs to be and is a very delicate balance between a spin out and a drift. And even though this isin't actually bad cornering with a drift it does feel like the other cars are better at drifting then the ones designed for it.\n\nClosing comments: I can't say much for Grid 2, but the original is definitly the better of the two in terms of control and just all round enjoyabilty. My take on Grid 2 and Autosport are bound to come later.","June 27, 2014","true","66.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love this game. I like the customization options, the fact that you can create and name and manage your own team, it's a nice bonus. and of course, despite the age of this game, it looks absolutely brilliant!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arbayer2/recommended/12750/","arbayer2","arbayer2 <BCI/TBfB>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arbayer2/","393 products in account","I originally saw Race Driver: Grid on YouTube. Much like many modern gamers, its uncountable number of Let's Plays and playthroughs showed me at the time that it was one of the most immersive racing games I could get for the PC. Needless to say, I eventually broke down and bought it. This review is solely the experience I've had after having played it (when I could) over the past few years.\n\n(If you're wondering about the (relatively extremely short) hour count I have on the Steam version, most of my time was spent on a non-Steam version years ago. Long story short I lost that copy and repurchased it on here a few months ago, hence the lack of hours logged. You don't need too many hours on the Steam version to know it's buggy, though... More on that later.)\n\nGrid, some say, took the Dirt series and put it on asphalt. What there was in this game was mostly appealing; beautiful graphics, an excellent variety of cars, complete with dramatic damage models and high-definition, animated vehicle interiors on world-famous (and other fictional) tracks. The vehicles are extremely detailed in both visual and aural design, including the whine of the turbocharger, the clunk of the E-brake and pedals, the intense screeching scrape of trading paint with the track wall or another driver and the unsettling whirring and whining of the steering linkage after one too many collisions.\n\nInitially, I found it difficult to learn how exactly to drive in-game, as at the time I only had a keyboard/mouse setup instead of an Xbox 360 controller (which, essentially, the game was originally designed for, that or a racing wheel... you can use a mouse and keyboard but in my experience you've got your work cut out for you in terms of handling. I don't have a racing wheel, can't judge that). The AI is quite challenging for that of a racing game in my opinion; your mileage may vary but it's difficult enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, while irritating you to no end should you have to restart a race due to being slammed into the wall or aggressively shoved between other competitors like a hot potato... made of metal, rubber, fabric, plastic and glass... with an exploding engine inside it. What a visceral experience, at least!\n\nThere was also a (fairly popular as I recall) online multiplayer mode in which you could buy and sell cars to each other (via a virtual eBay Motors, apparently... in-game advertising at its finest) and compete in races across the world. There were several planned DLC, including new cars, multiplayer race events and tracks. Even the singleplayer events were awesome: gymkhana-style drifting challenges, circuit racing, touge (a relay-style race on windy mountain roads from start-to-finish-to-start in two laps against one competitor).\n\nThere was a novel gameplay mechanic Grid introduced called Flashback, where in the event of a crash you can "rewind" a race to before the crash occurred to give yourself a few extra chances to complete it. There's nothing quite as cathartic as taking a turn apex at 190 mph, hopping into the air off a rumble strip, smashing through a tire barricade and three other cars and coming to a rest pancaked against the track wall... knowing you have three Flashbacks left!\n\nYou could create a virtual racing team, hire drivers and leverage their talent to give yourself a chance at dethroning some of the best drivers in the world. There was even a (time-compressed, obviously) simulation of the world-famous 24 Hours of Le Mans championship, an endurance race in which you have to fight your way to the head of the pack and avoid crashing for 24 minutes straight. Outside of all of this, the game's modding community allowed you to edit your own cars... although, because of a lack of research, I can't exactly say to what extent you could modify or replace vehicle models for sure.\n\nThe above is why I loved this game despite all its flaws.\n\nThese days, however, I see the game from a different, more critical perspective. Due to it being succeeded by sequels including Grid 2 and Grid: Autosport, it seems apparent that Codemasters have long since given up on maintaining support for the original Grid. Several game-hampering, if not game-breaking, bugs still exist, including some which cause framerate stuttering, the game's audio to loop unexpectedly (a problem I personally have NEVER gotten rid of, even after reinstalling, messing around with my game files to prevent the Flashback system file from ballooning to several gigabytes in size and disabling hardware audio rendering) and even random crashes to desktop.\n\nI've even read on Grid's Steam Community forums that some players' computers restart randomly after the game crashes -- but that's their word, not mine, this has never happened to me. The online multiplayer servers have long since been shut down entirely, inexplicably over a year before Grid 2's release, thus rendering the entire multiplayer mode broken -- albeit, according to Wikipedia, only for PS3 and PC, the Xbox 360 version's multiplayer may still be *ahem* Live. Not to mention that one of the promised DLC packs was never actually released. I got into the game far too late to actually purchase any of the DLC, so it's not necessarily something I'll miss as much, but it's still fairly disappointing. Even the game's support website has been removed - last time I checked, Codemasters' site only had support and forums for Grid 2 and Autosport unless I'm mistaken, which I could very well be.\n\nThe worst part is, in my opinion this was the best Grid ever, the finest game yet in the franchise. There are many great features in the sequels, but for me personally I loved the immersion more than any other feature, which makes Codemasters' idiotic decision to completely remove the cockpit mode from Grid 2 and put it back in in Autosport with cockpits not nearly as detailed as those in a game six years old somewhat painful. I'm still not sure I'll ever come back to this franchise, as at this point in time there's honestly better racers dedicated to arcade gameplay AND simulation, especially on Steam, putting the Grid franchise in a position of questionable purpose.\n\nThere are many reasons for me to recommend this game and many for me to warn you that you might be wasting your money. I've outlined most of them, but here's a brief recap:\n\nPros:\n-Beautiful, immersive vehicles, environments and audio\n-A wide variety of vehicles, environments and challenges\n-Then-popular online multiplayer and vehicle trading features\n-A fairly-decent (by today's standards, at least) example of early DLC\n-Very well-received, averaging 87% for all platforms on Metacritic (if you really believe in that sort of thing)\n-Some degree of end-user modifications!\n-Racing wheel and Xbox 360 controller support... in a racing game... thank you.\n-Fairly detailed level of customizable handling for peripherals\n\nCons:\n-Numerous unresolved, unavoidable, game-breaking bugs in PC version which at best harm immersion and at worst temporarily destabilize your computer... apparently? YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY... Heh, racing jokes\n-Multiplayer mode hastily discontinued\n-Official customer support non-existent, hastily discontinued\n-Sequels take the same formula and remove entire features unexpectedly... the entire series, it seems, has been trying to reinvent itself by force, for better or worse\n-Incomplete DLC release (gee, kinda like another racing game I liked a lot... *ahem*BurnoutParadise*ahem*)\n\nEDIT: 9/25/2014: I'm going to change my mind on my previous verdict and say that despite all its flaws (and in light of the fact that GameRanger can perhaps replace multiplayer and I finally learned that the audio glitch may have been caused by a peripheral), Grid is a very competent game that, if you can run it smoothly, will probably satisfy your racing/immersion urges if you're into beautiful visuals and arcade fun.\n\nFinal verdict: a flawed gem\n\n7.9/10","September 23, 2014","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

The voice acting is ok...the voices you'll be hearing constantly are at least half-decent, although some of the voices for the teammates you can hire are just flatout awful.

But if you're looking for a fun racing game with interesitng physics and a variety of cool game modes, a classic arcade art style, this is probably the game you're looking for. The campaign is fun, and has a unique sponsoring system to gain credits. While later on in the game, certain sponsors get OP and you will end up getting more money than you'll ever need to spend, it's a fun mechanic becuase different sponsors will give you different benefits, and keep the game interesting. The sponsors are decals you put on your car before racing, advertising a company, and if you complete their requirements (ie: complete at least 2nd and under 40% damage to your car) they'll offer you something like an extra $20,000 (varies depending on sponsor) on top of your salary for winning. You can have a multitude of sponsors, and depending on how many of them you satisfy, you can make more than double what you would have made from just regularly placing. While this game is old, has successors, the original GRID in my mind is the most superior. It has it's flaws, and there's probably better games out there, but if you're into racing games  GRID is a must have.","February 21, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
