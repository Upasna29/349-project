Although right now it is not a finished  game, but still a game in early acces (~beta) and key fetures like MP are not enabled yet.\nBut what you get right now, is well worth the money and one of teh best racing sims out there.\n\nWhat the heck is Assetto Corsa?\n\nAC is the work of a small Italian independent Studio: Kunos Simulazione, in sim racing circles around the world known for Net Kar Pro, held in highest regards due to its driving/physic engine and tyre model.  Never heard of it? -  Just like me. I was happy with the likes of GT 5/6 and Forza, never cared for what was going on on pc and didn't know what I was missing.\nAnyhow, Assetto Corsa is a pc racing simulator that tries not only to appeal to its own core audience of pc sim racers, but is aimed at console players too.  Assetto Corsa builds up on the predecessor Net Kar Pro, and if successfu,l will see updates, DLC and additional features for years.\n\nAssetto Corsa  - What makes it special?\n\nIFUN!  - Yes Fun, becausedriving is as much fun in the game as it is in real live. AC is a simulator which gets and provides exactly that.Unlike a lot of otherr sims AC is very accessible, easy to get into but hard to master.\nThe Driving Experience in AC: Just take a seat in the 1st car you like and start driving (my 1st love: BMW E30 DTM@Mugello) - Within the first round I had a big smile on my face, never before had I experienced such a great feedback and immersion with a Racing Game. - with a pad none the less The cars are  alive and responsive, you really feel  weight transfer, the tyres, and every part of the track - imho neither the GT Series, nor the Forza titles or the Sim Bin games I tried on pc  come even close.\n\nAC's driving/physics and tyre model is exquisit and unique in its way of easing you into it and letting you explore its depths. If you are looking for something in a racing game that is more detailed and refined than what you already know, then Assetto Corsa is without a doubt the right choice for you.\n\nPad/Wheel\n\nGreat improvement with Pad support in the latest update, no issues anymire.Though every Sim Racer will tell you, that you have to buy a wheel to enjoy this game that isn't true at all.  To this day I'm driving with a pad and have put 100+hours into AC with a XBox360 Controller and had more fun than I ever had with GT 5 or Forza or any other racing game - i.e. most of the pc simulators sounded like work to me till AC came around. I don't own a 3 Monitor setup, Racing Seat, wheel etc. - just a decent pc which allows me to play on high settings. So you can have fun and lots of it, and the driving experience is still a lot better than GT/Forza.\n\nAmount/Quality of content\n\nKunos got their hands on some 1st rate licenses, among them Mercedes (not yet in game), Lotus, BMW and Ferrari and more. AC focuses on GT2/GT3 cars and open wheelers  like the "almost F1" Lotus Exos S1 and the awesome old "Lauda" Ferrari . But more cars are to come, historicals F1, and much more.\nEvery car is beautifully modelled and whileForza and expecially GT feature hundreds of beautiful cars from all ends of the spectrum,  Kunos is not an industry giant like them and can't ever compete with that amount of original content. But the car selection is still more than decent, all  the tracks in AC are laser scanned and the variety is great - i.e.the Nurburgring GP track and it feels and plays awesome!\n\nBut here is the main thing: Assetto Corsa is moddable, that means fans are invited to produce and create tracks, cars, skins, Apps and much more - easy to install and a superb enrichment to AC. Just take a look at the beautiful skins or useful apps in the community videos - absolutely amazing, the creators deserve much praise. A big thank you to all the modders and unsung heroes out there!\n\nGraphics/Sounds:\n\nVery good, but not the very best (upcoming Project Cars) and the performance depends as always mostly on your GPU.  I use a Palit Geforce 770 4GB and play it with high settings. But this game is as you know by now not finished yet and will see a lot of improvements on quality and performace - and some of it has already been done. A low level pc with onboard grafix won't do, but with a high end system you can easily play on resolutions beyond 1920*1080.\nSound is above average and good, but is lacking punch in some cars and will improve with future updates. For those who can't wait for that, there are of course already some sound mods out there.\n\nConclusion  - Enough of the rambling rave - be part of Early Access!\n\nThere are a lot of things that are not perfect in AC yet, and some that are even quite frustrating at the moment. Some issues like setting up and finetuning controllers have been fixed and teh latest update saw the AI behaviour extremely improves. Almost all the frustrating and unfair behaviour are gone, most races are really great fun now with clean racing. The new AI is certainly among the best out there: they really race, they do not drive in a straight line behind each other and bore you to death. They actually give the very immersive impression that they want to beat you, they overtake you and each other, they make mistakes, defend their racing line and so on. With Update 08 most if not all of the terrible AI behaviour is gone anf there are only minor problems left.\n\nI can't stress enough how impressive the work of the small KUnos team really is. They kept word on every promise they made, gave or announced additional free contet and their updates are coming every 2 weeks - V08 is definitely a hughe step toward a final release version.\n\nFull Version\n\nThe full version of Assetto Corsa game is epected to be released within the next 2-4 months, and the complete content will be available then. That includes Multiplayer, Career mode and certain cars/tracks etc. Till then you get updates every 14 days, which include bugfixes, new features or new content. Until now Kunos stayed true to their word and kept the good things coming.\nTo me this a must-by for everybody who likes to play racings games on whatever system or plattform. If you want the full time hard core simulation immersion - AC delivers just that, but if you just want to have fun driving or racing without a hassle, just pic a car, and AC delivers just that too.\nAnd while it certainly isn't perfect and unpolished in some areas, it is very stable and relativeley bugfree (2 crashes during 150+ hours of play).\nOf course there is much to be done, bugs to be fixed, Controller, grafic performance optimization, adding features like Multiplayer etc. - but I really feel by now that Kunos deserves trust.I will update this review when and if essential features are added and the final version is released.","March 7, 2014","true","600.3"," 278 of 304 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","278","304","0","13"

And boy does the PC racing scene need a fresh boost like this.\n\nTalking of physics for a moment, I am not sure it's as all-conquering as some are saying, but that doesn't take away from the experience - the physics are still pretty darn impressive and right up there with the best on PC and destorys the consoles (as you would expect). One of the breakthrough aspects of the cars is how planted and solid they feel under the limit, which means those fresh to real sim racing will find it less frustrating to enjoy and "get it". But push any car to its limit and you'll quickly realize there is serious depth here. I currently prefer AC to any other sim out there when i think of physics, fun factor, potential, and so on.\n\nThe current car and track list--which is now coming in stages whilst in beta-- is drool worthy. Ferrari F40, 458, BMW M3 GT2, Spa, Monza, Imola -  it just goes on and on, and all the tracks are laser scanned, too. Some classics are missing, but with modding support and promises of DLC in the future, I can see many of these such as Sebring, Mid Ohio and Brands Hatch, coming in due course (along with many more tracks and cars).\n\nThe key now is to intoduce good community aspects into it's UI, and a multiplayer experience that pushes the boat - not just a bland server list where to be in the know you have to join fragmented leagues in multiple forums all over the world. It should all be handled in the user interface.\n\nAssetto Corsa has the potential to bring a fragmented community together. It has the graphics, physics and interface to change the face of sim racing on the PC. Buy it and support Kunos, they seriously deserve it.","November 25, 2013","true","294.8"," 242 of 267 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","242","267","0","3"

I HOPE THEY FIX THIS ASAP.\n\n\nSo is it a good game? More - then +.\nIf you like driving/racinggames like rf,gtr,iracing and own a wheel it is definitely a must have. ATTENTION: Nordschleife will come as DLC with 10cars and is NOT INCLUDED in the release version of this game.\nIf you more confident with a simple xbox controller then wait for project cars or stay with forza motorsport/gt.\nSingleplayer sucks cause of KI and limited simulation of real racing.\nPUBLIC Multiplayer sucks cause of many, many, many wreckers and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wannabe schumachers.\nBest solution is to download some hillclimb/rallytrack mods and enjoy the driving from point a to b. ALONE. Or join a racingleague for fair and hard racing (but not too close :))\n\n\nThis is my personal opinion after 770hours of testing and driving, bugreporting and following the developement since day 1 of ea release.\n\nCheers and have fun\n\n\nUPDATE: now programm state is 1.1.6\n\nimproved sounds: very nice, special in replays on shorter tracks. with headphones....5.1 surround sound sounds not so good a\nimproved graphics: good for people with 1gb vram\nimproved tyres/physics: if you stay away from the simcade settings optimal - still benchmark\nimproved multiplayer: yes, door-to-door is more possible, many options still missing\nimproved ki: thats the part what make me the most sick about this game. After they introduced the ki in the ea i had read a review about it in the official ac forums where the guy said that the ki is more acting like real human beings, some are aggressiv some passiv and he told his experience of his first singleplayer race. and after i tried the singleplayer mode 2 months after the release i had exact the same experience like he had when the ki was "new". its still impossible to do a simple trackday with different cars driven by the ki and have fun race. damn its even impossible to follow a abarth 500 train cause the ki driven ferrari behind is unable to overtake the 500 but when you overtake the ferrari he will most likely crash you instantly out of the race. whats the point of playing a racinggame where the ki is dumber then a texas instruments calculator? and the devs said in the ea phase that most players will only use singleplayer and not multiplayer so they focus more on singleplayer....ähm wtf?!?\nand now they splitting up the costumers into "good dlc buyer cashcow players" and "bad only stock/mod content poor players" in multiplayer....wtf?\n\nYes the game is still in developement but where are the times when you buyed a game and it was (almost) complete and with all features players wanted and features which are also needed to say it is a simulator and not a mariokart. But no kunos said they dont want to get competion against simbin, iracing, rfactor so now you have the result. ki not working, singlepayer racing only 10 laps max....multiplayer which you also cant enjoy to its full capacity if you dont buy dlc(´s). Please Kunos stop seperating each part of you game into a calculation part to get money. If you have a full package you will get your money cause you will have a overall good product and not a thing which falls apart in every aspect when you watch it close.","December 1, 2014","true","795.1"," 341 of 392 people (87%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","87","341","392","17","8"

Barbacoco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roufles/","96 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n*UPDATED to .21*\nFor me, one of the best racing sims out there. definitely recomendable.\nI will make a list of pros and cons (list for V0.94) so you can decide for yourself:\n\nPros:\n-Best driving simulation I've ever tried, the car is so predictable that you can even go sideways playing with a mouse. Dont get me wrong, you really NEED a wheel to enjoy this game. Almost every car is easy to drive in your confort zone, try to go above it  to earn some tenths and it will become tricky before you lose the control of the car.\n\n-You get a bunch of cars (a bit of everything) and a few laser scanned circuits. We are talking of the closest to reality models you can get on a game here. More to come, the Green Hell as dlc in October I think\n\n-Mods (with dev tools soon *already released). mod apps (displays, corners performance,..),mod sound, mod tracks (one of high quality already, crappy ports too), and mod cars (soon* already released good ones: shelby cobra and gp2).\n\n-Small and friendly dev team. They ask, you answer, they give (list of wanted cars and traks) and you ask, they answer (if you have some problem)\n\n-Game modes: Im just here for the multiplayer but there is a lot of challenges, time atack mode, drift and drag mode too. *multiplayer is enjoyable already, you have some jump in and drive servers and more serious ones\n\nNow the cons:\n-As early access: everything works in single player, the AI needs a bit of agresivity tuning, now avoids you an doesnt defend its position. The devs have said to v1.0 there will be 2 sliders for strenth and agresivity. Multiplayer have some lacks but it was  released this friday so it will be better for sure.\n\n- you dont have a massive list of cars like lets say Project Cars\n\n-As the time writing, is not possible to have another light source than the Sun, so no night races yet. You can race from sunrise to sunset with dynamic time and stuff\n\n- Not weather yet\n\n- Car damage (visual and mechanic) is not implemented yet,  seeing the perfection of the grip simulation I'm sure it will be top-notch tho\n\n- *You will find some idiots on the multiplayer from time to time in open servers, but what multiplayer game doesnt have them? (btw i've only seen one in 150h, the rest is just lack of experience)\n\nfinal thoughts:\n\nIf you are still reading this, buy it, you wont regret it","May 11, 2014","true","260.7"," 176 of 187 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","176","187","0","8"

No other game comes close in terms of making you feel that you are part of the car and giving you that racing buzz.\n\nMy favorite racer for some time was GTR2, but it was getting a little old and tired in the looks department and it's feel. I've got a ton of racing games on various platforms and it is safe to say that AC has the best feel hands down of any.\n\nStep into the legendary 98T lotus as an example, up the boost, watch the engine strain, hear the tyres screeth and feel your car squirm as the boost comes in and you fight to keep the car facing forwards on the track, whilst meanwhile that beast of an engine sound is giving you a rush. Limit the boost to save the engine, fly into a corner too hot, try to take someone on the outside and up the boost again trying to outdrag them as you fly past and look to the left screen seeing the engine flashing red and them dropping back in your mirrors - you know you are pushing it hard and the engine won't last like that forever!\n\nHonest this game is a credit to the developers, and for anyone who thinks it doesn't have enough cars or tracks, this game is all about quality and not quantity.\n\nNow they have added the Yellowbird it is a fantastic addition. Such a tailhappy fun beast of a car to drive and drift around in.\n\nYou've got your sporty production cars, tail-happy beasts such as the mighty Cobra, and limited production cars / race cars. All of the sounds are unique and the charteristics of each car make it a different game with each car you step into.\n\nAbsolutely spot on, and worth it for anyone who is into their racing sims.\n\nIt's worth noting that if you want to push the visuals on multi screen setups you do need a fairly hefty system though. I am running an I7 4770k under water and two GTX 780TI AMP's. I can max everything out apart from the hi-res mirror reflections and smoke needs to be turned down. I would imagine for a single screen though that somehting like one 780 would be plenty.","February 4, 2015","true","131.1"," 239 of 268 people (89%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","89","239","268","23","4"

The AI is terrible on that game, but in multiplayer with friends its a great time.  I enjoyed it so much, I thought, have I missed out on one of the best genres of games?\nSo I picked up Assetto Corsa, and tried it out.  It was fun in third person view with the controller, but as I read through forums, and spoke to others I was missing out.\nThis is a SIMULATOR, a program DESIGNED to mimic real life driving and thus cannot be enjoyed fully with sticks and buttons, and that a wheel, no, a good wheel was going to improve my experience.\nWell, for my birthday, my wife got me the G27 wheel, and my goodness, this is where this game absolutely excels.  There is nothing like it, I truly feel as though I am driving the car (to a point) and I LOVE IT!  I tried Grid with the wheel, and its not bad, not bad at all, its the difference between Outrun and getting a day at a real racing track playing AC.  There is also modding support, so if I want to drift one night, I have a some drift cars, want to drive F1, those are there, and the amount of tracks and cars provided by the community, are increasing daily.\nSo....to sum it up, if you are looking for a game, this probably isnt for you, but if you are looking to have a real racing experience, this is where its at!","August 19, 2014","true","62.7"," 177 of 192 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","177","192","0","5"

They are a small group of people and do a good job listening to us. They have improved this software so much in the past year that I had to update my review.\nOne thing I am sure, from hearing about what others are describing about AC, is that each hardware setup (computer/wheel/screen/vr) behaves a little different. One car can be more responsive then another, while someone else experiences the opposite, which can make for some colourful conversations. (This is getting better.)\nThen of course there is the settings (comuter/wheel/software). So much can be gained or lost here.\nGo through (assettocorsa ini) file and set everything to your computer/wheel.\nI got Razer Cortex, which shuts down background apps. Got Malwarebyts, which cleaned hundreds of pups.\nDownload the (Anti Clipping and Fanaleds) apps for your wheel.\nREFLECTIONS set down to low and static reflections set to very low, may help.\nI find it harder to drive in game than a real car so be patient and be aware of your speed. 50 mph still feels like 30 mph to me.\nI still have to remind myself of the power I have, without any repercussions to the $500 000 car or myself/public property. I had a V8 Vega (300+ horse, curb weight 2500 pounds), could, at times, leave me shaking for the rest of the day. I could only imagine the skid mark a car like the  LeFerrari could cause in your underwear.\nAssetto Corsa's physics really is incredible.\nThis is getting very real. Assetto Corsa is worth all the money and time.\nOne other thing that has me so addicted is the track and car mods.\nChecking to see what is new every day is one of my favorite things to do. Just try searching Google Image "Assetto Corsa car mod downloads" and see for yourself.\nI can't emphasize this enough.

In Assetto Corsa you get behind the wheel of one of many realistically recreated cars ranging from the little Abarth 500 (upgraded version of the Fiat 500) to the beast that is the Pagani Zonda R. You'll push these cars to their limits as your storm around the tracks this game has to offer including the legendary Nurburgring (part of the Dream DLC Pack 1).\n\nBefore I get to the main part of my review I want to point a few things out which have had an impact on my opinion of the game. Firstly, I'm not a racing sim expert, far from it in fact, most of my racing experience comes from the arcadey side of the genre so I'm less used to the level of realism found in AC. Secondly, I played using an Xbox 360 Gamepad rather than a wheel and pedals since I don't own a wheel. Thirdly, I own the Dream DLC Pack 1 so my review will include things only available as part of the DLC. Finally, I haven't followed the game through it's development and I've only played the most recent version which is v1.1.6.\n\n+Good graphics and visual effects\n+A good selection of cars which are all well modeled\n+A good variety of tracks including a laser-scanned Nurburgring\n+Quite a lot to do, including: drag races, solo track practices, time trial events, race weekends a career mode and much more\n+Surprisingly good controls for a Gamepad\n+A fair amount of customisation options for the cars in regards to tuning and paint jobs\n+Great sound effects for the cars\n+All of the cars, even different versions of the same car (e.g. a production model and a GT model), feel very different which makes driving each one unique to driving the others\n+It's very easy to get into for beginners like myself\n+A huge amount of mods\n+Lots of info displays which you can choose to use when racing\n+Despite AC being out of Early Access, Kunos are planning to continue adding more and more content to the game which can never be a bad thing\n+AC supports Oculus as well as three monitor setups, while I personally don't make use of these I know they're important features for a lot of people\n+Reasonably quick load times\n\n+/-Penalties feel a little too harsh to me but perhaps that's just because I'm not a racing sim buff\n\n-The AI are pretty bad, they seem to have a path which they absolutely have to take and don't feel at all like they're actual drivers which is what you would expect from a racing game. On top of this they're also very 'timid' when it comes to overtaking and unless you go off the track chances are they'll just stay behind you for the rest of the race\n-While you can change the time of DAY that your race takes place at there's no night time in the game which is rather disappointing\n-Weather effects go no further than clear skies, clouds of fog so there's no rain which is again, rather disappointing\n-The soft-body physics is really bad, doesn't look at all realistic, for example driving 150mp/h into a solid wall left my bumper with some small dents and scratches\n-The controls which can be bound to the Gamepad are very limited, for example you can't bind pause to your Gamepad so you have to reach over to the Esc key every time you want to pause which gets frustrating very quickly\n-The mouse cursor is always visible on screen, one my biggest pet peevs\n\nVerdict:\nFor regular gamers - Worth Purchasing (8/10)\n\nFor Racing sim veterans - A Must Have (8.5/10)\n\nA fantastic racing sim which can be enjoyed by those new to racing sims as well as veterans of the genre, though it's far from flawless. If you have any interest in racing games I suggest you pick this one up.\n\n***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***\n\nEl K.","May 28, 2015","true","18.2"," 159 of 193 people (82%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","82","159","193","11","17"

Assetto Corsa is a simulator that brings the revered true-to-life racing experience to the casual gamer. This game bridges the two worlds together without losing rigidity as a racing simulator. This is a simulator that will punish you for entering a corner too fast, or giving too much gas in a corner. But at the same time it is so delightfully simplistic and intuitive that it is easily playable by almost anyone. Assetto Corsa is one of the few racing simulators that is fun, and still encourages you to make mistakes and learn from them. If you are coming from console games like Forza, or GT and are looking for something more, then this is the game for you. Assetto Corsa is truly the best racing simulator there is.\n\nHowever, this game is by no means perfect. One of the biggest problems that I have for this game is the lack of awareness of speed. This leads to the driver entering the corner much too fast, and creates an inorganic driving experience. This problem is mostly notable in the interior driving view. Other reviewers have mentioned this as a flaw and it certainly is one. I found the best way to correct this is to adjust the FOV or go to either the bonnet cam or the bumper cam. If you are someone that can get used to the inside cam (where it occurs the most) then this might not be a problem for you.","December 22, 2014","true","43.1"," 95 of 110 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","95","110","2","3"

I'm definitely a car game enthusiast, and Assetto Corsa is the best racing simulation I have ever played. No other game, in my opinion, comes close to conveying such a sense of how it really must feel to drive these cars. Assetto Corsa has nice graphics and sounds, but it's the laser scanned tracks and an advanced physics model that really set it apart. To provide specific ideas as to what this means, weight transfer is beautifully conveyed, the way the cars behave makes sense, and you are driving on surfaces that virtually exactly match reality. Something I really enjoyed for example was how the same cars handling varies with tyre choice. Take a street tyre for example, you will feel the tyre roll and the car slide relatively easily and quite predictably. Put on a racing compound however and you now feel the car chassis working harder, and when the grip does give out the slide is much more dramatic and less easy to control. There is huge depth and many hours to enjoy exploring such aspects, without it ever becoming frustrating or unintuitive. Assetto Corsa is still 'early access' as I write this, but there is already a promising and welcoming community, and plenty of good content, with more coming in the form of additional manufacturer and track licenses. This is a must have for any driving enthusiasts game library.","June 8, 2014","true","200.0"," 82 of 92 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","82","92","0","5"

The tracks look realistic and there's isn't this over exposed lighting or over the top effects that you see in a lot of so called simulation racing games.  The enviroments in Assetto Corsa  look clean, crisp and believable.\nThere's the option to enter photo mode and mess around with the direction of the sun, field of view, focus levels, light levels and some pre-set filters, it's well executed and gives you the chance to get the perfect screenshot.\n\nThe tracks are laser scanned for that ever so more realistic driving simulation, this applies to the "Next Generation" tracks but not the "Historic" ones.\n\nThe physics engine is great, it acts how you would expect it to and every curb and bump on the track has a direct affect on your car.\n\nThe force feed back is amazing, it lets you know exactly how your car is handling and it all adds up to an immersive racing simulation that brings a smile to your face.\nIn Assetto Corsa you go from sliding off the track at every corner to setting decent lap times, pushing yourself that bit more each lap and it's a very rewarding experience.\n\nThere's a ton of game options ranging from practice, challenges, race, online and all with sub categories.\nWith enough driving assist options for any level of player, full traction control, full anti-locking brakes, 100% stability control and all adjustable from full to completely off.\n\nAs you would expect for a PC game there's enough visual options so you can get the frame rates set to what suits you best.\nI use a R7 265 2GB graphics card and never dipped below 65FPS, 1080P with a custom settings, anti-aliasing x2, anisotropic filtering x8 and high to maximum details, so I would say this game is very well optimised.\n\nThere's full key mapping for keyboard, steering wheel, pedals and xbox 360 controllers. I would recommend a steering wheel with force feed back as it's so much better.\n\nThe main menu system is fast and easy to use.\nThe menu system when you're driving is great, you can a choose a huge amount of options ranging from gear indicator to suspension physics and you have the option to drag them and place them where you would like.\n\n\nI feel overall the sounds in this game are very nice, there are a few cars which sound too digital to me but I've never driven them so it would be unfair to judge.\n\nThe A.I for me is pretty good, there's been a few tweaks to make them better and with the original Assetto Corsa content (Not mods) the A.I does a great job of doing consistent lap times as well as being smart enough to avoid crashing and give a good challenging driving experience. Even at 80% difficulty which is there lowest setting they are pretty fast.\n\nThe modding community is on fire with this game, obviously some mods are poorly done but there's also some that are on par with what the Assetto Corsa development team have created and that's saying a lot because they do superb work.\nCars, tracks, textures, Ui, there's pretty much a mod out there for everything.\n\nThere's still a few issues with this game that need to be addressed in order to make it the full on simulation game. Pit stops only work in multi player and still need to be tweaked, there's no flag system yet but there is small mod for it and the penalty system is really awful and needs to be removed and rethought. The option for weather and night time driving would be a great touch but it's not something that's game breaking.\n\n9/10.\n\nGrazie Kunos Simulazioni, Grande lavoro.","January 4, 2015","true","308.9"," 99 of 119 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","99","119","3","12"

I can say that no you dont need one to enjoy the game; however, having one brings a whole new level of depth to playing it. I started out playing this game on a keyboard, that's right a keyboard, and there was not a second that i did not enjoy it. Then i switched to a controller and the game got even better. Faster laps, more precision, the game just became a ton of fun.\nRecently i was privileged to try the game on a wheel and i can thoroughly say that this game is as authentic as it can get as far as the driving experience in a video game is concerned.\n\nLet's talk about graphics:\n\nSure this game doesnt have amazing graphics where your wheel is gonna go in a different direction than the car, but that isnt something that you need to notice because after about 2 minutes in a car you are immersed in how your car handles and how fast you need to take the next corner. Also when you're going by the trees at lets say 250kmh there really isnt time to look at them :P\nAs far as the tracks are concerned they are phenomenal, lazer scanning is such a huge plus and they're going back to update some of the original tracks.\n\nDLC:\n\nSure it's a little extra but its so worth it. All three of the dream packs are stunning and they give free content along with the update, and i dont really know of any other company that gives anything away for free.\n\nMods:\n\nThere are countless mods for this game and although not all of them are the best there are some REALLY good ones out there that are on par with Kunos' content.\n\nMultiplayer:\n\nPeople complain about the AI a lot, but let's be honest if you're racing the AI you shouldnt even buy this game. This game was built for an online experience and with over 800 servers up 24/7 there is always one that you can find with tons of people, or you can find an empty one for you and your friends to race on. It's also very easy to host your own server from your computer, the game comes with the files to make managing what content you want on it so easy. Theres always a server for whatever mood youre in.\n\nTHERE ARE SERVERS WITH DRIVER RANKINGS SO YOU DONT HAVE TO DEAL WITH TROLLS\nI say that in caps because a lot of people complain about that, but it really isnt an issue. Those people are just butthurt.\n\nI 100% recommend this game, it's a whole lot of fun even if you dont have a wheel. A controller at least is a good point to start with. A keyboard is doable but it takes a lot of time and finger cramping.

I'm talking 10 people: small, and with heaps more mouth watering content on the way with bi-weekly updates in the lead up to the full release of v1.0, Assetto Corsa has the potential to become the best racing simulator ever produced.\n\nPhysics:\nKunos have spent countless hours on developing and refining the physics engine to produce the most realistic driving experience that money can buy. Using sensors on various places on real world cars, they can accurately replicate the technical sides of the car. They're also receiving feedback from real professional racing drivers as to how particular cars handle on certain tracks.\n\nWhich leads me on to tracks. Kunos are using laser scanning technology, so every bump, camber and curb will be near enough identical to their real world counterparts. There are the odd glitch or two with sticky curbs and such, but this is to be expected with this being still a relatively early build, and will thus be ironed out.\n\n... Oh yeah, did I mention that they're releasing a laserscanned version of the Nordschliefe in September? Because they're doing that... Yeah. Anyone who knows anything about motorsport or sim racing should know how big of a deal this is, because it's never been done before by any gaming company... Ever.\n\n\nGraphics:\nThe visuals are pretty decent. There are some situations where it doesn't look that great; with jagged edges and a few poorly textured surfaces, and other times where the game looks absolutely stunning. The game gives great "bang for your buck", in that you don't need a $100,000 super computer to play it, and still have a great looking game (**Cough**Project CARS **Cough**).  In fact even when some of the settings are set to "low", it still looks good.  For example, the cube map resolution takes a massive chunk of performance if you have it set to "high", but on "medium" or "low" it still looks brilliant and you get a huge boost in FPS.\n\n\nAudio:\nThe sounds, like the graphics are also really good. I'd say they're probably second best behind Race Room: Racing Experience. As with the physics, Kunos have tried to accurately represent how each car sounds with microphones and various other pickups to get each car to sound very distinct. They've also managed to implement backfiring and overrun gurgling, which is a first that I've encountered, and it is joyous. Whether it be the whirring turbo of the KTM X-Bow, or the completely bonkers twin-turbocharged V8 in the Ferrari F40 (which quite frankly is just a scary car to drive), this is some of the best sounding cars I've ever heard in a video game. Although the BMW Z4 GT3 isn't quite right, as it's slightly too high pitched and needs a deeper gargling growl that the BMW cars tend to have.\n\n\nFinal Take:\nPhysics: 9/10\nGraphics: 7.5/10\nAudio: 8/10\n\nKunos have created a beast. And when multiplayer drops, watch out iRacing, these boys are coming for you.","February 10, 2014","true","521.2"," 56 of 66 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","56","66","0","1"

At night or day, the amount of detail is nothing short of stunning and the available photo mode makes it easy to capture wallpaper-worthy screenshots. Shortcomings include a lack of weather system and the relatively bare scenery at some tracks.				Sound		7		The quality of the sound varies from car to car. Some delight your ears with crackles and pops and whines while others leave you feeling disappointed, though one has to remember not every car sounds exciting in real life. Developers have stated they are still working on improving sound assetts.				Physics		9		Few racing games can match Assetto Corsa when it comes to physics. Suspension, tires, track surface, and more are all accurately modelled to offer the most realistic driving experience possible, short of the real thing. Naturally, this does mean you'll want to play with a wheel to enjoy the full experience.				Force Feedback		8		Force feedback is always going to be subject to opinion as not everyone agrees on what it should be doing. Assetto Corsa's version does a good job of communicating weight transfer but can fall short when it comes to fine detail. Overall, it's easy to know what the car is doing and anyone who spends a few minutes configuring their settings should have a good time.				Cars		10		Assetto Corsa features 69 cars at the time of this review, with more being added regularly. LaFerrari with a functioning KERS system, working active aerodynamics on the Pagani Huyara, and even McLaren P1 software updates that affect rear wing behavior are just a few examples of the painstaking amount of effort Kunos Simulazioni has put into the details of every car in this game.				Tracks		9		17 tracks are currently featured in the game, all of which are recreated down to the smallest bumps, cracks, and camber changes thanks to laser-scanning technology, including the famed Nürburgring Nordschleife. The total selection is relatively low but that's the price you pay for quality - quality that makes the driving come alive when combined with the excellent physics.				Multiplayer		7		The multiplayer can suffer from trolls and bad drivers like every other simracing title that supports open races. That being said, the netcode is solid and the multiplayer experience can be excellent if you choose to join an organized league. Unless you're willing to shell out lots of money for iRacing, Assetto Corsa is almost as competitive as it gets in this category, but it does suffer from clunky pit stops and a notable lack of a spectator/replay system.				AI		3		The AI in Assetto Corsa can best be described as "serviceable." It's there and it can drive pretty fast if you let it, but it combines a tendency to carelessly crash into the player with (oddly) over-caution. It's quite easy to block them while ahead but if you get them off the racing line, they almost always do everything in their power to return to it regardless of the consequences.				Career		3		It's difficult to enjoy the career with the AI in its current state. It can feel quite repetitive without giving you any sense of accomplishment. A handful of races are impossible to win even with world record lap times and others are quite easy to dominate despite being on the same difficulty setting. Some series also advertise "race weekends" without actually offering them.				Mods		9		Assetto Corsa is currently the hotbed for simracing mods. If the game doesn't already feature a car or track you want, it's probably on a website somewhere or soon will be. You can mod everything from the cars, tracks, and sounds to the menu, HUD, and career. The downside is that the developers will sometimes update the game in a way that break mods until they too are updated.				Overall		8.5		If you're looking for a hotlap simulator or a platform for league racing, then Assetto Corsa is second to none (or at least it will be when it gets a proper spectator/replay system). Casual pickup multiplayer racing is still entirely worth the money, but you'll probably want to skip the purchase if offline AI racing is the main thing you're interested in.","April 28, 2015","true","859.8"," 52 of 63 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","52","63","4","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcmetroracing/recommended/244210/","mcmetroracing","MetroRacer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcmetroracing/","111 products in account","I've taken 2 years to finally write a proper review of Assetto Corsa, to try to like it and write a positive review. But I've been let down, so there goes a thumbs-down review.\n\nAssetto Corsa came out almost 3 years ago as an Early Access release for a reasonable price taking into account the amount of bugs, lack of content and everything that an uncompleted game brings. The title got a quick nice response from users for its remarkably detailed physics and the absolutely superb work on cars and tracks modelling, being the tracks laser-scanned. Another positive point well welcomed by the community is the full mod compatibility, which extends the possibilities of the game in terms of content and personalisation to amazement.\nKunos though are a very small developing team which has worked so hard to release new tracks and circuits, all of them officially licensed by brands, and refined the game architecture to add capabilities, fix bugs and improve and optimize graphics and performance. All this work is released slowly, drop by drop, long time between, but at least they release it.\nThis year though they decided to get the game out of Early Access, and with a nice full-price tag of double the initial price. The game itself works smoothly, quite well optimised (don't trust the minimum GTX460 required, you can run it with a GT540 easily) and with full compatibility with any wheel or pad. Where's the problem then?\n\nAs said before, the amount of content is alarmingly low. After some years the number of cars and tracks hasn't increased much and the variety isn't quite wide really. You have the full Lotus catalogue and most Ferraris, and then a few other cars like a McLaren MP4/12C and its GT3 version and some other road cars. Don't misunderstand me, having such fleet of Ferraris and some of the fasterst road cars is rather coool. But the problem is that they end up being all the same. All the Lotus cars are similar, Lotus cars are similar to some other featured cars, Ferraris are similar to the other high performance cars... After all, you have an acceptable amount of models, but you can summarise them in a few. There isn't a car that outstands among the others, or different types of cars like go-karts or more motorsport disciplines. In fact, you can differentiate 4 categories: F1 cars, Supersports cars, Sportscars and Abarth. I've driven every single car released and it's like that.\nDespite that, with the first non-beta release a DLC came out, which adds the Nordschleife and ten cars, which again you can summarise in 4 new real additions. And for a price of 14,99€, right after having paid 49.99€ for a game that seriously lacks content. Unreasonable.\n\nThe game is limited to hotlapping. AI is just unraceable because it will just stick to the racing line. Make a move and they'll bump into you as if your car wasn't there. Rival cars will never make a mistake nor get corner-cutting penalties, which you get every time you put a single wheel outside the tarmac and that slows you down to 50kph.\nPractice and Hotlap sessions are fun though, they feel as if you were actually there driving on a client run. The entire circuit for yourself, just you and your car. Actually it's fun, especially using a wheel. It ends up challenging yourself to beat your lap time, but after some laps it gets boring...\nAlthough it's been announced as out of Early Access, the game itself proves it is just the same as before. Only fully playable mode is hotlapping and you can only play on dry track and not at night. The fun part of this game is pushing against the clock to beat your lap times, but if you can only race in the same weather and light conditions the challenging aspect of the game is lost as soon as you have lapped a few times every circuit.\n\nOnline was released in mid Early Access and it was reasonable and justified that it didn't work at all. Later updates made it more stable and raceable, but nowhere near from easy to use. It worked with a "booking" system. There's a server list with the race info (players, ping, track and cars allowed). Those which are post/pre-race are open for around 5 minutes for people to join by "booking" an entry on the race. There's not even a matchmaking room, you just click the "booking" button and wait 5 minutes to play, although most times when the countdown ended the server would just crash and force you to book again. If you manage to enter a race room, it is most of the times empty.\nBad part of this is that despite being claimed "1.0 version, full release" the multiplayer keeps just the same.\n\nMods are more or less easy to find. There are portals and forums which have the Mods and Download sections and uploaders generally have a decent knowledge on the matter, so their work is usually nice although don't expect to find everything you're looking for because most of the mods get banned for copyright and licensing. The game though isn't very respectful with mods. After an update you may find that none of the mods you downloaded are compatible, and as they're mods they don't auto-update. Annoying stuff if you have a large collection of mods.\n\nIn the technical aspect, Assetto Corsa is close to brilliant. It may not have rainy weather, or night racing, or a proper damage system, or headlights that actually work or breathtaking graphics effects, but the attention to physics has no rival. Aero effects, weight balance, force feedback... Absolutely amazing. If we take a look at updates changelogs, most of the updates have to do with these things. Handling then will be completely realistic, tricky as it should be.\nIt is not at all playable with gamepad though, but this game is a simulator so it's rather "dumb" to play with anything different from a wheel, which works perfectly once set up.\n\nThe base is solid and really promising, but the lack of content is a fact to consider. Not only that, the gameplay is limited and lacks basic functions. I don't want to compare this game with another one because it's not fair and every game is different on it's own, but Assetto Corsa isn't the best option for a race simulator right now. I'd say it's better to wait until more content is released, but I've done that for a long time and it's becoming hopeless. It's not fair to double the price of the game when it has almost the same things that you had when it was Early Access. Not to mention the DLC...\n\n*PATCH EDIT*\n\n2 more DLC...\n\n4.5/10","September 10, 2015","false","43.5"," 350 of 543 people (64%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","64","350","543","25","30"

The early release of Assetto Corsa has satiated the long awaited sim racing community, as the beta and bi-weekly updates kept everyone satisfied.\n\nSim racing fans will argue about who has the best tyre modelling, most accurate tracks, physics and visuals, but Assetto Corsa has managed to take all that and package it up in one great racing sim, with a top-notch physics and sublime tyre modelling, spending time with each car you will appreciate the nuances of the physics each vehicle has to offer.\n\nThe visuals speak for themselves, crisp, clean and easy on the eye. The tracks are accurately modelled and replicated from laser scan data. The force feedback, even after logging on a solid amount of hours, is appreciable with subtle feeling still surprising me.\n\nOn top of the regular developer created content, Assetto Corsa already has lively modding scene, making third party tracks and cars, so the future is really bright for this sim and I don't doubt most will still be playing this in years to come.\n\nWith a great core, Kunos Simulazioni has proven that they have built Assetto Corsa into a successful racing simulator.\n","February 1, 2015","true","146.3"," 40 of 45 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","40","45","4","0"

I liked the idea of a racing sim, but I came from the F1 201x, GT5/6 games on the PS3 so was unsure if it would be too technical for my liking....and frankly too hard.\n\nWell, I'm so glad I bought it.  I initially got the Technology Preview for buying NetKar Pro for a few quid, but the early access was far more fun than I thought it would be.  The game has constantly been developed by Kunos with regular updates (every 2 weeks) and now multiplayer is out it's made it even better.  I started with a DFGT but purchased the T500RS and TH8 shifter just for AC. It was a good investment in my eyes as it brings the cars to life.  The Lotus 49 around Monza 66 is my favourite, and it's such a beast to handle - but great fun in trying!\n\nHandling - This blows any console game out of the water. I bought Race 07 and that doesn't come close to AC.  I haven't been able to try pCars.  The FFB is superb, and I can only hope they continue to improve this. If you have cold tires with a heavy fuel load, you really notice the difference in turn 1 compared to low fuel warm tire runs.\n\nSound - This could be better.....and will be!  AC recently mentioned they will use a new audio method for a better experience.  It's still pretty good as it is, I can't complain as I still think it's good.\n\nCars - Whilst there are a lot less cars to other games out there, it takes so much time to get really good with the cars I just don't care. There are some car's I've hardly driven as other cars get me hooked.\n\nTracks - The bumps in the tracks are something else. You play F1 and it feels like you are driving on a perfectly smooth track. You go around the Nurburgring on AC and you have to work for a decent time and learn where some bumps are to avoid (or use for better traction).\n\nMultiplayer - There are tonnes of servers up. It's easy to host a private lobby but you do need to be comfortable playing with config files as there is no GUI yet in the game.  Most tracks allow 20 cars.  Lag isn't too bad either, I regularly play against someone in New Zealand when our server is in the UK. It's not perfect, but it's raceable and far better than other games I've played online.  On the down side the options are pretty limited as MP is in the Alpha phase.\n\nWhat else is in the game:\nAI Races\nTime Challenge (where you have to reach a checkpoint within a time period)\nHotlap\nDrag Race (AI only atm)\nRace Weekends\nSpecial Events\nDrifting (I've not done this as I'm turd at it)\n\nMods - There are loads of mods out there already. Hotlap leaderboards, car skins, tyres wear/temp mods, nicer GUI's, and tracks!  Whilst they aren't as good as the offical tracks, it makes the future very bright for AC.\n\nLike any MP game, it's better if you have a good community to race with.  I do @ www.acracers.com.\n\nFrankly, this is my favourite game period. I enjoy other genres, but this game keeps me coming back for more.","June 27, 2014","true","295.8"," 51 of 63 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","51","63","0","2"

RFactor may offer better physics, I haven't tried it.\n\nAC may be behind some of the above on graphics and AI, and is definitely behind Forza and GT on car and track selection, and the depth of the career mode.\n\nSo you have to figure out what you want in a game, due you want fidelity to real life, with accurate simulation of each car, precise aerodynamic and drivetrain calculations and laser scanned tracks, or do you want to be able to drift around corners without sacrificing lap times? Do you want a false sensation of speed, or an accurate introduction to cornering and car weight distribution? Do you want top level AI and reward intensive career progression, or are you happy endlessly lapping empty tracks, looking for slight improvements in your cornering technique.\n\nI much prefer the later, but I don't mean to disparage those who enjoy the former. I've spent my last 30hrs in game lapping one track (Zandvoort in the Netherlands), with one car (the McLaren 650S GT3) and the experience has been hugely enjoyable as I try to approach race car driver speeds (which I'm sure I'm far off, currently only the 5th fastest on RSR for that combination). The feel of laser scanned track through the force feedback is incredible, the handling dynamics superb and the complexity and precision of high-speed racing is endlessly fascinating to me.\n\nIf you want to genuinely feel the sensation of racing a well modelled 458, or a McLaren P1, or a GT3 or F1 car through Spa, or the Nurnburgring, this is a near perfect way to do it (short of somehow renting one!)\n\nIf you're a fan of driving, buy AC and invest in developing technique. If you're a fan of arcade style multiplayer, or the quick fun of frantic drifting buy something else.\n\nHighly recommended, from someone looking forward to the new car releases in May and June. If they can add some American and Japanese tracks, expand the list of road cars, continue to tinker with the AI, and maybe, eventually, develop a solid career mode, then this will be a perfect racing game.","April 16","true","180.2"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","27","28","0","0"

I looked into this game after a few Google searches on what games I should play once I get hold of my Logitech G25 again and after a few YouTube videos, I decided to go ahead and buy it even though I didn't have my G25 wheel back from my buddy yet. I took a "risk" and ended up buying the game for its full price and played a few laps with a Xbox 360 controller. It didn't seem anything special, the tire/handling physics definitely did stand out but I didn't want to judge this game from my experience with a 360 controller so I waited.\n\nFinally I got hold of my G25 and set it all up in order to try this game, and WOW, I have tried many driving simulators on PC, PS3, Xbox360 and all with Force Feedback wheels but I have not come across a game as Realistic as Assetto Corsa. After a few practice laps, I made sure my rotation was set to 900 degrees with 100% Force Feedback strength and fully manual setup with no traction control, just 100% Stability (as I was testing the Zonda R).\n\nI still cannot get over how good it feels, everything is so realistic, the graphics are way above average when compared with other driving simulators and I'm sure it will only get better as this game is still in Early Access 0.4. I have not yet played a driving simulator that can provide me with the most ACCURATE yet CHALLENGING Force Feedback, which is very rewarding when done right. Force Feedback has never been better on a game in my opinion.\n\nFrom the Early Access 0.4 version, this game is definitely one of the best investments I have made in Driving Simulators. I feel like even with early access, it was worth every penny of my money (which I haven't recently felt even with other games, not just driving simulators) and it will only get better once AI is released, once Career mode is released, and once Multiplayer is released. The Assetto Corsa Development team is heading in the right direction with this game so my expectations are very high and I'm sure myself, and other consumers will not be disappointed.\n\nI'm personally most excited for Multiplayer and I can see myself spending countless hours in Drag, Drift and Track modes competing with other enthusiasts.\n\nShould you buy this game? YES! But make sure you have a good Force Feedback wheel to go with it, preferably with full pedals, a H shifter etc.\n\nLast but not least, I have also recently invested in 3D gaming, and this game was easily the best looking 3D game I have played on my 40" Samsung (with Nvidia 3DTV Play Software), once all the depth and convergence settings were done right for each camera view, but that's pretty much something you have to do for all 3D games so I wouldn't even consider it a con.\n\nGo and buy this game!","January 15, 2014","true","052.8"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","30","35","0","0"

It is one of the few titles that truly deserve to be called a "Racing Simulation" in a genre where many games proudly boast the moniker, and then severely disappoints in that regard.\n\nPros:\n- A true Racing Simulation on PC, one of the very few titles to come out in recent years\n- Good production value, you can really see that the devs know what they´re doing\n- Extremely good physics engine\n- Good graphics\n- Relatively fast AI\n- It´s stupidly easy to use mods\n- there are tons of high-quality mods of cars, tracks and UI apps readily available\n\nCons:\n- 80% of the included tracks are Italian\n- 40% of the included cars are Lotus (seriously, there are 7 variations of the Lotus Evora and 5-6 for the Exige... Who the hell thought this was a good idea?)\n- Some other cars are sorely missed instead (No R34, Lancer Evo, RX-7, Challenger, Charger, C63 AMG, SLR, and no Audi´s,  Porsche´s, Toyota´s, Ford´s, e..., at all!)\n- AI is extremely taxing on the CPU (I have a 4 GHz AMD Octacore, and yet CPU occupancy goes above 95% when I race more than 10 cars, causing the game to stutter on my system)\n- AI is incapable of actually fighting for positions (they may drive quickly, but once you have caught them, you´ll easily overtake, and they will never undertake even the slightest try to get the position back)\n- The flag, pit stop, weather, day-night mechanics are NOT available yet. This means no chance for real competitive gameplay yet.\n\nTotal: 7.5/10. Don´t get me wrong: It still is one of the best racers I have ever played! But i have to admit, I most likely only love it so much because it has no competition. There are a bunch of things that are wrong with this game, that need to be critizised.\nBut when you´re hunting your ghost on the Nordschleife, piloting a (Mod) Mazda 787B on a cold track... you´ll forget about all of the flaws. You won´t notice any flaws, and even if you did: You wouldn´t care.\nIn these moments, the game deserves a straight 10/10, and it will be worth the asking price all of a sudden.\n\nrecommendation: Hell yes.

For about a day, I did a lot of research to see if there is any other racing games out there worth considering, I ended up considering to buy Project cars or to re-buy assetto corsa. After watching a lot of reviews on YouTube comparing these two games I decided to re-buy assetto corsa, due to the positive reviews, and I absolutely don't regret that now. Yes, it takes patience and yes it requires practice but it's worth it all! After take the Pagani Zonda for a spin on the Spa, I finally understood what the experts are talking about when they speak about treating the car with tough love and drive it like you hate it, cause if you don't, the car will "bite" and you find yourself of the track within seconds\nAll in all, a very great game, that's absolutely worth recommending!","May 5","true","27.8"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","25","27","2","2"

Yellow... yellow... yellow... Green... Wait.... Wait.... Wait.... wait.... Wait...... Go. Its more of a guessing game i'm not even sure if the wait after the Green light is even the same every time it feels random and waiting 4 seconds after Green just makes no sence.\n\n\n\n\nOverall good game especially for Drifting (only really two cars for drifiting.. No silvias.. I know right?! a Drifting mode but not Silvia? blasphemy!) Just feels like it needed more content before taking it off of Early Access.\n\n11/10 - IGN Skyrim with wheels.","February 9, 2015","true","53.1"," 37 of 48 people (77%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","77","37","48","10","0"

The game didn't changed much. Kunos simulazioni are still really bad at communicating and are very arrogant banning you if you criticize the game or ask something. I'm not talking about childish comments like "your game sucks".\n\nThe game has a big potential. The physics are good. It has great force feedback. You feel the car, you feel almost everything through the wheel, the driving feel is really good.\n\nDevelopers keep adding new cars and the game gets better and better in this department, but still i want to see subaru, nissan, ford, audi, peugeut, opel and many more. It‘s a racing game so we need more cars. Of course i don‘t want fake 1000+ cars like in GT series, where you get the same 50 cars in different colors which counts as different cars. But i think ~100 different cars is a must and it's going the right way. Yes there're mods, but i want professionally created cars/tracks, not by some amateurs. There's no auto updates for the mods, so if you have like 50 of them you must update them manually every time. And some mods for this game cost money. I don't approve such behavior and will not support it.\n\nThe track selection is not very good at the moment. Still there‘s no famous nurgburgring, but it is annouced as DLC. It‘s not like i‘m against DLC, but i think such track must be included in the game from the start. Especially seeing how good the game sells they should have the budget now. I think Kunos did not expect such luck. It would be cool to have some fictional tracks as well.\n\nAI. It's bad. AI is not aware of you, they just trying to drive trough you. So racing against AI is not very fun. At least they've sorted the difficulty so it's possible to beat AI now even if you make mistakes.\nPenalty system is absurd. It punishes you every time you go out of track, no matter if you cut the track or slide off the track. Where's the logic behind this? I'm already punished myself by going off the track and lost time and stupid system makes me go on 50kmh for 5 seconds and lose more time.\n\nThere‘re challenges too, but they‘re so hard that there‘s no fun playing them, it feels more like a hard work than playing a game so all the challenges are pointless. The best times should be achievable to all players (after some practice of course), even for those which are playing with keyboard/mouse or with a controller, not only for aliens. Online leaderboards should be the place where aliens rule. Oh and forget the game if you're playing with a controller. This game must be played with wheel only. If you're looking for something similar to forza or GT, know that this game is nothing like this.\n\nMultiplayer. It's a joke. MP is boring and pointless. There's no leaderboards or player profiles, no statistics. Most of the time there're too little servers, you just can't find a game. You can join the league, but it's not fun for a casual player to compete with pros.\nAfter releasing the full game only tools for kicking people were added. Of course now every mod can ban/kick whoever he wants or dislikes without any reason.\n\nCommunity is one of the worst. AC fanboys are the worst, you can't say anything bad about AC or criticize it. The game is perfect for them.\n\nWhat year is it? Almost 2015! And there's still no night racing and no weather conditions. Even GT5 has this and it's some old game made for an old console.\n\nGraphics. The cars looks really great, but everything else is just bad. Like from 2006 but enhanced with hdr and bloom.\n\nNo leaderboards. It is really fun in raceroom experience to see the times from all over the world, find your country and try to beat the time.\n\nThere are few game modes.\nCareer which consists of races and time attacks, It will take some time for you to complete it and you'll try the cars.\nTime attack. It's some broken game mode which makes you go slower. The slower you go in the first couple of laps the more points you get.\nDrift and drag racing which i'm not interested in so i can't say anything about them.\n\nAnother small annoying things:\nWhen in photo mode you can't hide the racing line.\nMouse pointer do not disappear while playing.\nCan't pause the game and check apps.\nRacing line is completely broken.\n\nYou can have some fun in career mode and in MP with friends, but besides that i can't see how this game could be fun for a non hardcore sim fan. I'm still trying to like this game. It has some really attractive things and hope Kunos will improve the experience for non hardcore sim fans.\n\nPros:\n\nGreat physics\nGood graphics\nGood performance\nSetup sharing\n\nCons:]\n\nLack of tracks\nLack of cars\nNo workshop support\nNo leaderboards\nShallow career mode","December 25, 2014","false","99.6"," 329 of 545 people (60%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","60","329","545","12","36"

I find it hard to play it in less than 4-5 hour stints. I just can't help myself. Odds are, you're checking out this game because you like cars. LOOK NO FURTHER! With everything from the physics engine, to the graphics that look frighteningly realistic, this Racing Sim has it all. Beautiful layouts of tracks, cars, intuitive UI for modding the cars' geometry with various suspension setups; that help to not only enhance your Sim experience but to teach about the way cars work in general. I have only played for <100 hours but thats because I thought I could make Raceroom Racing Experience a little bit more like this game.ITS NOT POSSIBLE! I'VE TRIED!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheesenium/recommended/244210/","cheesenium","Cynical Cheese Cake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheesenium/","466 products in account","Assetto Corsa has a lot of potential but fell short in some ways. However, at it's current stage, AC is indeed a great racing game for racing fans.\n\nFirst of all, the driving physics is great with excellent suspension and weight transfer physics where the cars tend to sway and bank in corners realistically like what I expected it to behave. The tire physics is also pretty decent with some good amount of simulation in it's tire model, despite it feels a bit too predictable to me. The game's drifting physics is great though as it feels fantastic to throw a car at a corner drifitng in this game. In my honest opinion, the suspension and weight transfer physics in AC blow other racing games out of the water but the tire model fell a bit short in comparison to Race Room or pCARS due to its predictability. Even though AC has one of the best driving physics among racing games on Steam, what made the game standout to me is this game also offer accessibility  to players who does not own a wheel. The game plays great on gamepad with more precise controls offered than other racing games. However, a wheel is still a must for games like AC as AC is known for its amazing force feedback that made having a wheel the optimal way to enjoy this racing game. Still, if you only have a gamepad, the game is perfectly enjoyable to play on gamepad considering the game offers a reasonable amount of assists such as stability slider(0-100%), auto gear change, ABS and traction control. More importantly, I personally find AC's driving physics to be fun to drive with good amount of depth with each car feels decently unique to drive around a track. Isnt it what racing games supposed to be? Racing games should be all about racing on different tracks while driving different cars that handles differently, instead of pointless grinding for upgrades and cars.\n\nIn terms of content, AC offers a variety of licensed manufacturers from Ferrari, BMW, Mercedes Benz, KTM, Ruf, Lotus(both classic and modern), Fiat, Mclaren, Pagani and Shelby that ranges from humble Fiat 500 to Nikki Lauda's Ferrari 312. At the same time, AC also features super cars Ferrari 458, coupe such as BMW Z4, FIA GT3s like Mercedes Benz SLS GT3 or lastly, fire breathing monsters such as Pagani Zonda R or Ferrari 599XX. There is definitely something for everyone and if thats not enough for you, you could always head to sites like racedepartment.com to download additional cars made by the community where you can get Japan's only Le Mans winner, Mazda 787B, single cup racing cars such as Ginetta G50 GT4 or even the pretigious German DTM cars. The car list can be a bit too Euro centric to some people but the developers had also announced more manufacturers are coming to AC in the future, for example, Audi, Lamborghini, Toyota, Nissan and Corvette. On the other hand, AC's track list is pretty lean to some as they only feature 10 locations that are all based in Europe at the moment that includes Imola, Monza, Silverstone and Spa as examples. AC's tracks are all laser scanned where you can feel every bump and crest when you drive on it's official tracks which does add a lot to the authenticity of the game. In my opinion, AC is still lack of popular tracks such as Brands Hatch, Laguna Seca, Le Mans Circuit and so on. Still, you could always find community made tracks to further enhance the game's track list. Do note that AC's mod community quality varies wildly so you will definitely need time filter through mods to find gems in the modding community. At the same time, Kunos has intentions to support the game for the next 5 years so do expect the game to have quite a few DLCs. So far, the first official post release content pack seemed to be a decent expansion pack where it comes with the 20km long laser scanned track, often nicknamed as Green Hell with 10 additional brand new cars introduced into the game. At the same time, the developers will also patch in free cars and tracks from time to time such as the recently patched in Ruf CTR2.\n\nMy main criticism with the game so far is, AC is lacking in terms of features if one compared it to some of it's competitors, rFactor and Project CARS. At the time of writing, there are many features that are common in real life racing series such as night driving, rain weather that will affect your car's grip, AI pitstops and flags penalty. The developer had confirmed that Flags and AI pitstops will be added into the game eventually but rain and night driving will probably not included in the game until it's sequel. Another criticism of mine would be, AC's AI is fairly rudimentary as they are completely unaware of player's presence in the field where they might crash into your back occasionally while they have some tendency to over brake at some parts of a track that made them easy to overtake. Since Early Access, the developers had been patching the AI to perform better but it is still a far cry from what rFactor, Raceroom, Grid Autosports or Project CARS can offer. The multiplayer servers are also barebones with confusing UI and lacking of the robust multiplayer feature that iRacing has. However, the worst part of AC would be it's optimisation where the ">95% CPU Occupancy" issue that will cause stuttering and poor AI performance still persist till now if you race with more than 20 AI cars. This issue is particularly severe if one plays on community made tracks with less optimisation but one could always opt for less cars on grid to eliminate the issue. There are optimisation being fixed with patches but I sincerely hope this issue will be fixed in the future. Still, optimisation issues are expected in racing games such as AC due to it's more computational intensive simulation in comparison to Grid or NFS while some racing simulators in the market, such as rFactor 2 are said to have CTD issues in some cases.  If you just want a great racing game to race with 15 AI or hotlap solo around a track, these optimisation issues are unlikely to occur. Lastly, the career mode in AC is completely forgettable as it is just a few preset championship events that offers barely anything new from what you can do in the race menu. The career mode also does not offer any progression system that is found in Forza or GT6 where you had to buy and upgrade cars.\n\nIn conclusion, Assetto Corsa is a decent racing game at its current stage with reasonable amount of content. Just like French cheese that tastes better as time goes by, I have no doubt that AC will improve over time with official DLCs, new features and also mod content from it's healthy mod scene being added into the game. At its current stage I do recommend this game if you are a racing fan looking for a more simulation heavy racing game and do not mind some of its flaws as AC is still a competent racing game at its current stage.\n\nI had played more than 70 hours so far and I could see that AC will be on my HDD for some time in the future. It is definitely a great time to be a PC gamer as more and more racing games such as Assetto Corsa, Game Stock Car and Project CARS are developed independently for PC.","January 6, 2015","true","263.7"," 35 of 45 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","35","45","3","1"

I can say without a doubt that Assetto Corsa feels like the best. That's not to say the others are without merit, they have their own strengths and weaknesses. But when it comes to communicating the way the car feels to you through a force feedback wheel, AC is second to none. You can truly feel when your car is riding on the edge of available grip and the car will react accordingly to the inputs you give it. The physics and FFB are something that need to be felt to be believed.\n\nThe AI needs some work but can be passable, however I feel that online leagues where this game will shine for those looking for strong, clean, competitibe racing. Public lobbies can be ok, however you may find griefers driving the wrong way and trying to wreck others. Ask around forums or check steam groups if you are looking for clean racers.\n\nI hesitate to speak too much on controllers as I use a wheel and pedals, but I will say with many aids turned on it's not impossible to keep yourself on track. It may be a fine way to learn the tracks while waiting to purcahse a wheel.\n\nI have no doubt Kunos will continue to supply top-notch free and paid content in the coming years which will be finely supplimented by content created by modders. AC will definitely be a hub for great racing from many different fandoms in the motorsports world.

Excellent as a single player game its needs a lot of improvement to be a viable multiplayer platform for league racing which is where most of the multiplayer racing scene is active.\n\nSome notable features that are missing from AC which should be incorporated as standard in a racing game are:\n\nA flag system.\nPit Options menu for choosing tyres and fuel strategies. etc.\nNot having to wait for the car to stop before you can abort back to the pits.\nTraction Circle and Tyre Temps widget.\nFuel Usage widget.\nWarmup Session.\nAllowing drivers to finish laps before moving onto the next session\n\nThe most major missing item is Server Admin Controls to allow for restarts and administration of players that are causing issues. Having a voting system is not enough. An Administrator needs to be able to make decisions on restarting sessions without a vote.\n\nAs I do most of my racing online with others in league racing I cannot therefore recommend this game at present. As these things become added and fixed it will probably be the best racing game ever made to date but not in the present format.","December 14, 2014","false","60.2"," 36 of 54 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","36","54","0","2"

Started playing Assetto Corsa when it was first put on steam. I could not have picked a better simulator. I've played a LOT of racing simulators/games, but this one sticks out the most. With the modding community releasing new cars and tracks every other day. The original cars and tracks in the game are top notch! The handling is awesome. The graphics are beautiful. Overall the atmosphere is pretty sweet. I'm glad 1.0 is here it was definitely worth the wait, and I can't wait for future content I will be supporting the developers for such a great simulator!\n\nThe only con's is: # 1 The AI they are really buggy, But it does not matter because in a simulator you race against real people for the full effect and it does not bother me one bit!\n\n#2 To get the full experience you will need a racing wheel, I have tried it with a controller and it was just a mess, than again it is a Simulator.","October 15, 2014","true","290.3"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

Right out of the box it has the best, most naturally feeling and pleasing physics out there.\nDo you want to drive slowly? For the first time ever, you can. Do you want to drive over the limit? That works too.\n\nIt's also the first sim to officially support drifting without adding weird, mode specific physics, and the fact that I had to watch several real life instructional videos to get the hang of it speaks volumes of how good this is.\n\nThe most important thing though, it just feels good. The force feedback on this thing is simply way ahead of the competition, cars feel real, you can feel every bump and elevation change on the road, you can feel weight shifting (not only lateral but also longitudinal forces too, somehow), it's just bananas.\n\nLet's also add the fact that it looks gorgeous and has fantastic performance, plus official mod support (not yet imlemented, but there's plenty of awesome mods already in the works), and great developer support and you got yourself a great sim that's bound to last.\n\nThe fact alone that I've played this for over 15 hours already and it doesnt even have AI or multiplayer support yet (it's an early access after all) speaks for itself.\n\nIt's good, if you got a wheel, then get this thing, it's kickass.","November 29, 2013","true","71.7"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","21","29","0","0"

I wasn't one of those guys who hyped it before I played it. Hell I was absolutely skeptical when one of my better friends went absolutely nuts about it on Facebook based on Kunos' reputation alone.\n\nUnlike him, i've actually got the PC hardware to actually play the game. When I first loaded the game I was incredibly underwhelmed. Bearing in mind I just spend 33 bucks on an impulse buy, and that I play on a 360 gamepad due to the logistical nightmare of setting up my wheel, I was rather underwhelmed. The framerate was choppy, aliasing was absolutely everywhere, the textures didn't look nice at all, but the worst was that it felt a bit arcady. Cars felt like they were far too reactive and the BMW M3 GT2 felt like it had too much grip.\n\nWell, one visit to RaceDepartment.com forums fixed absolutely EVERYTHING wrong with my initial set up. You do have to fiddle around with the Nvidia control panel (if you're team green) and the in game set up to get the best visual quality, but one of the biggest oddities in the game is the way Kunos handles assists and tyre compounds. Its not something that is intuitive, and i had to put some research in to actually understand the UI. I eventually found out that i was running on the SuperSoft compound, which to my knowledge isn't actually used in GT racing.\n\nOnce I flicked it down to the harder compounds, absolutely everything fit into place. The car felt absolutely divine, playing on a controller was not a problem at all. Never going to be as good as a wheel but those without that option need not worry. One thing this game has changed the way I play race sims is the racing line. In Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsports, F1 2012/13, anything that actually offers a racing line really, I've taken that option. Assetto Corsa has weaned my off that reliance, at least in the game, and has given me the confidence to give it a go in others as well. Playing this game with only the rev counter and gear indicator on the bottom right is truely an experience unlike any other. I booted up the game as of writing, intending to see how the M3 GT2 goes on the harder tyre (I tried out the Zonda R earlier today, it was brilliant). I recorded 10 minutes of it and spent the remaining hour just lapping and learning the track and car.\n\nAssetto Corsa is truely astonishing. I had not heard of Kunos' reputation before hand with netKar-Pro, I knew absolutely NOTHING about the title before I plonked down 33 bucks on the recommendation of a friend. I am now absolutely in love with this sim and can't WAIT to see whats Kunos has in store for the future.","November 26, 2013","true","58.2"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MisterRedBeard/recommended/244210/","MisterRedBeard","MisterZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MisterRedBeard/","236 products in account","TL;DR: The following review is inaccurate (because it is now a year old) and although the game has goen through huge improvements on the points criticised and other things, I still do not recommend this hotlap-simulator.\n\nUpdate: a year after, it seems like the netcode and AI have been updated and make the game become playable with other cars on the track. They added 4WD support and a few free cars next to the DLCs to show off this new feature of the physics engine. DLC #3 has been released, with some Lamborghinis, nice to see them deliver that promise. One of the Lambos in the game however is community content that has been promoted to be part of the official game (if I remeber correctly). All in all, if you are searching for some fun driving cars around track with great realism and don't care for AI or online multiplayer, you might want to try the game. Beware though, it is a simulator, so it is best played using a steering wheel, preferably a 900degree, so you can use the full lock of the cars.\n\n\nWith the announcements of the Dream Pack #1 DLC I felt like I needed to warn potential buyers of this game.\nSo here it goes:\nAfter having pre-purchased this game and having early-access being able to play the beta, it was a pretty good experience, the physics are okay most of the time and feel incredibly good with lower power rear wheel drive vehicles (eg: BMW M3 E30, BMW M3 E92, BMW Z4 E89, BMW 1 Series M Coupe, KTM Xbow, Lotus Evora SR, Lotus Elise SC)\nThe front wheel drive cars do not feel that great to me, but as I am not a fan of these I will pass the subject.\nNow for the gameplay aspect:\nMenus are reasonably well designed and constructed, the options menus is very big with a lot of options (very nice to see). Just a little side note, menus are a seperate process from the game engine so you can let your PC cool down a bit between two races which is a nice segue to bring you to the graphics engine part of the game...\nGraphics, well oh boy... The optimisation... the obvious lack of thereof... The graphics look good but it's nothing extremely spectacular and yet I struggle to max out the settings and get a decent framerate (my system: 2-way SLI of GTX 680s, an i7 4770k @4GHz and 16GB of RAM)\nThe in-game UI is very minimal and is not very well optimised for the multiplayer aspect of racing in my honest opinion, but Kunos has THE answer, modding... Yes, like the rest of the game, you can mod, and the UI is coded in Pyhton so you can either make your own or download one from someone else.\nI will not comment on multiplayer as my experience was sub-par to all the other simulations I've played but it was about 8-9 months ago so it might have changed.\nThe AI is horrible absolutely not aware of you the race on rails they are not braking when you are and thus bump into you and thow you off track, the difficulty of the AI is also something strange... You, well I at least, can't keep up with the race leader, if you don't overtake the AI in the first 3 to 4 corners well the cars in front of you are going to vanish into the distance and you'll never catch up, interrestingly, if you turn the scenario the other way around, if you are the race leader, even if you don't drive that well and don't set lap records they'll never catch up (assuming you don't crash of course).\nSo finally Assetto Corsa becomes a solo player hotlap simulator with... not a lot of content.\n37 cars of which probably half are just variants of the same car\n10 tracks where 3 of them have a second shorter variant\nA drag strip for quarter and full mile\nA dedicated drifting playground "track"\n\nBut this not a lot of content part will change in the same horrible fashion that game developpement has seen fit to go towards... Yes you guessed it, they have at least 1 DLC planned.\n\nRegarding the controls also very important to note, if you do not have a steering wheel... well do not try the keyboard and the controllers are a nightmare to use and to make it worse...\nYou have to have a 900 degres steering wheel because the game supports it but also likes to map the 900 degres of rotation to a 270 degre steering wheel making the force feedback way too powerful and the steering way too sensitive and imprecise.\n\nAlso apparently 45EUR (or your regional equivalent) is not enough... they want to add content but also fill their pockets because yes game devs also want to live they do not work for free, they are planning to release a DLC in the coming weeks... months...? but thanks to its naming scheme we know that it is far from the only DLC that is planned...\nWhat the F is wrong with game devs nowadays? Why DLC? Whay not wait to release the game for full price when the game is ready and finished, when there is content that make the game worth buying?\n\nAt this point I don't know what I should do with it other than poke it with a really really long stick to see when new content is going to be added, and see how much the DLC will cost...\nAs I generally do with any game that does include DLC in its roadmap... look at blizzard people please, they have a roadmap that says:\n1-dev\n2-bugfix\n3-release\n4-make sure everything is stable\n5-dev DLC*\n6-Bugfix DLC*\n7-release DLC*\n(8-repeat steps 4 to 7)\n\n* In Blizzard terms, DLC means expansion that is downloadable, your game does not tell you all the time "this content is part of a DLC to unlock it buy the DLC", no instead it doesn't show anything of it in-game, it does show however a nice thing on the Battle.net Launcher saying that there is an upgrade available for this game. A Blizzard expansion is typically more expansive than a DLC and for a good reason, it add a butt-ton of content and updates and patches and additional balancing and new awesome Pixar-like quality animations for cutscenes...\nPLEASE EVERYONE STOP BUYING DLC...\n\nAnd here isa little bonus (yay more text). It's the comment I left on the Assetto Corsa facebook page regarding the announcement of the Dream Pack #1 DLC:\nNot long ago they made something "very fun and appropriate". They released a video teaser of the contract deal they signed with Lamborghini in which they show 4 different cars that are not part of the game, and obviously advertises the game as having these cars in it when obviously no one has seen them in game... They're part of the upcomming DLC (not the lambos, these are clearly coming later)\n\nThe modding aspect is great, allowing and encouraging modding is great. But making an engine adding 10-15 cars plus a racing variant of some of these cars and another engine another racing class (essantially the same model but with 300 HP instead of 350 and weighing 1100kg instead of 1250kg doesn't make it that different), 10 tracks and asking the community for their money and hard-work to make the game worth a damn by making mods, and asking to please not upload poor quality mods because it's an elite game, we want to have good content... (The please do not port is a genuine thing on the modding part of the assetto corsa forum, feel free to go and check it ot yourself)\n\nI am not happy about the money I spent on the game, it was too much for the content provided...\nI would prefer for them to remove their branding for the game, because frankly "Your racing simulator"... Well it bloody hell isn't mine...\n\nThanks for making it this far :)","January 10, 2015","false","105.9"," 86 of 151 people (57%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","57","86","151","10","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ntst22/recommended/244210/","ntst22","ntst22","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ntst22/","93 products in account","Brief Introduction Assetto Corsa is undoubtedly one of the most popular racing simulators out there, despite all the good things and bad things from this game, I feel a bit half-half about this game.\n\nBut before we get into the review lets go over what the developer had to say about Assetto Corsa\nOriginally posted by Devoloper of Assetto Corsa: Assetto Corsa features an advanced DirectX 11 graphics engine that recreates an immersive environment, dynamic lighthing and realistic materials and surfaces. The advanced physics engine is being designed to provide a very realistic driving experience, including features and aspects of real cars, never seen on any other racing simulator such as tyre flat spots, heat cycles including graining and blistering, very advanced aerodynamic simulation with active movable aerodynamics parts controlled in real time by telemetry input channels, hybrid systems with KERS (Kinetic energy recovery system) and energy recovery simulation. Extremely detailed with single player and multiplayer options, exclusive licensed cars reproduced with the best accuracy possible, thanks to the official cooperation of Car Manufacturers.\nWhat I think about the Game  Pros…\nAs a proper car simulator, I think you should be able to feel every little bit of the road, and with Assetto Corsa, you’re able to get that. The actual physics of this game is magnificent with a force-feedback wheel, this is achievable. With a decent wheel and pedal system, you are able to feel the understeer, the oversteer, even little bumps in the road – this means that you can feel it build up, and you know when you’re going to lose it. In this whole simulator aspect, I think this beats out its competitors, such as Project Cars. Despite losing out on graphics to Project Cars, it makes up in terms of physics and overall “realistic-ness” to the driving experience. The details put into the exterior and interior of cars, even moving parts of cars is phenomenal as well.\n\nand Cons\nBeing given this great first impression of realism makes me so reluctant to criticize this game, but once I dug deeper into my hundreds of hours of Assetto Corsa, these small missing details of a racing simulator starts to bother me more and more. Weather effects aren’t available in this game, like driving in the rain, and I think that as a racing simulator, it’s a must have. The AI isn’t that good, but neither is the AI in its competitors. Thus flags are a thing, but no marshals? Pit stops too, where are they in single player  is the realistic-ness in them?  It’s not like they don’t have it in motorsports. Where the crew changing your tires?  Where are your car jackers?  Where are your post-race celebrations? C’mon and you still call this a racing simulator. I want to see yellow flags going up when there are crashes half way around the circuit, I want marshals to be waving the blue flag so I can go “Hey Dan, go ♥♥♥♥ yourself because you’re ♥♥♥♥♥”, I want the full enjoyment of your pit-crew working on your car. Developers, wake up, you might as well call them “Need for Speed: On the Track”. All the Assetto boiz are going to dislike this but it’s the truth.\n\nOverall Thoughts It’s a great simulator, great handling, great experience, but has way more things to improve on. If you’re going to label your game a “simulator”, don’t give us something half-♥♥♥♥♥ and something that’s not complete.\n\nConclussion? Yes, despite all the downsides of the game, I think it's one of the best racing games, let alone racing simulators out there. But developers, get off your asses and do something about it.\n\n\n\n(If you found the review helpful, giving it a thumbs up would be nice!)\nIf you're looking for more Steam Friends? Look no more - feel free to add me!\nThus, hit me up if you want to play Assetto Corsa with me\n\nEdit1: A few gramatical errors.\nEdit2: Thanks @Inbekannt - pitstops are a thing now in Assetto Corsa, adjustments made to the review","May 28","true","312.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","3"

I am writing this review and the title is still in development and is in Alpha/Beta stage.  The reason that I do not care about if it Alpha or Beta is because it is excellent at whatever stage it is currently.  This title has it all, it allows MODS, it allows private servers, custom skins... the works! The physics model is excellent and the sounds are absolutely spot on. Camera views and the ability to record and save your replays so you can analyze any section of the track at any point in the race is incredible.

I would like to post my review regarding AC. First of all, I would like to mention that my PC is old (Pentium 4 CPU, 2GBram, 256MBgpu) and yet, I managed to run this game on the lowest-possible settings. These settings allowed me to have 50+fps on track called ''Drift park'', although on other tracks, I was struggling with FPS (I can only blame my low-end pc for that!). I'm very satisfied with the way I felt the cars with my G27 wheel through FFB. FFB felt very precise and I could really feel every single car (including the open wheelers). I've been playing LFS for the past 6 years and I've also tried iRacing out and, in my opinion, Assetto Corsa has it all - the physics, laser scanned tracks and licensed cars and..-you name it!\n\nWhen I got in the game for the first time, I was amazed by the interface! I was just blown away from the way it looked. It was unbelievably easy to setup my wheel for the first time in AC (G27)..it took me less than two minutes!\n\nI'm not exactly sure what else could I mention, mainly because I would need to get a better PC to enjoy the game completely, which I'm planning to make happen in the near future. I really hope that the AC development team will optimize the game even more, so perhaps people with low-end PCs could have a go as well! :D\n\nIn the end, I fully recommend this game to anyone who has a racing wheel and likes racing. Trust me, racing simulators are way better than arcade racing games! Assetto Corsa has a bright future, just because the development team cares what people think! Cheers to AC developers for being so responsive. Keep up the awesome work, Kunos Simulazioni!","March 10, 2014","true","4.9"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

I needed a racing game like Forza and GT, not grid 2.  Asseto Corsa has mostly delivered on that. Migrating to racing sims has been tough.  Cars are harder to drive, and there aren't many options for customizing anything other than the setup. Considering that real driving involves that, not upgrading everything whenever you feel slow, I can deal without the modability.  Being early access, there isn't much to do.  There are a few challenges and enough to keep you racing for quite a few hours, but I can't wait until the carer gets implemented.  The physics, the sense of speed, the sound, and the graphics are all top notch. While there is still some optimizing to be done, this game runs beautifully and racing with AI or alone is bliss.  Multiplayer has yet to be implemented.  Another thing I really like is the ability to mod the game and add apps.  Open mod support is huge for games in general, but a racing sim will see some really cool stuff, we already have!  The apps are for the UI and there is source code to encourage the community to develop apps.  Apps are generally used for displaying some data, but its nice being able to customize my UI, and place everything, from lap times, to the odometer in a specifc place, out of my way.  I have logged over one hundred hours in this beta, and I've been smiling the whole time (except when AI bumps you off the track, bt they are getting better with each update, drive cautiously)\n\nUPDATE(3/16/15):  The Nord has been unleashed and its epic.  The car pack equally insane.  AI has been greatly improved, although most would argue they arent all that fast or competative.  There are flags now and some other minor tweaks to gameplay features including tire blankets, fog, factory settings, etc, etc.  The only complaint I have for the game is the career.   Everything is unlocked from the start tho, so get out there and get driving.","February 25, 2014","true","234.0"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

As an avid Forza fan for years I have always wanted something I could play on PC. Now, don't let me lead you on this is NOT Forza. It is a very different type of sim-racer ( for those looking for a direct replacement ). It is much less forgiving, but focuses more on the accurate reproduction of racing.\n\nIt is a gorgeous game, far prettier. The handling is a lot more on the realism side; and as such are pretty difficult to get used to.. but with the right setup even an Xbox 360 controller will be tolerable. The track selection has improved a lot since very old updates of the alpha I had played, and the game has gotten a much larger selection on cars.

The physics are good, the cars are fun to drive, and its overall very realistic. The reason I recommend you not to buy this is because of it's lack of content. A lot of the cars feel the same. There is very little difference between each car, and there are not even that many cars to select from. The track selection is also mediocre.\n\nThe real fault in this game is the lack of good multiplayer support. The multiplayer in this game is just a series of community servers. Its very hard to find a server hosting a legit race. If the game ever introduces a matchmaking-type multiplayer, then this game would definitely be a must-buy. But as of now, the multiplayer sucks. You run out of contect quickly with singleplayer, and after about 10-15 hours you lose your drive(haha) to play the game.\n\nOverall, the game does an amazing job at capturing real driving, and makes it super fun to drive the cars.

Whenever I start a game it asks me to install Steam, which is rather odd because I launched the game from Steam. If I click install, it makes me quit Steam which makes me quit Assetto Corsa, and it reinstalls Steam; but will do the same thing if I try to start another race. If I click cancel and dont install Steam, it just takes me back to the main menu in Assetto Corsa.\n\nI emailed the developer about this, and their response was to post my question to their forum, and hope that another person who paid money for this game will tell me why this game refuses to acknowledge I have Steam installed. I sent a response saying this was unacceptable, and the developer refuses to respond to that. Are you serious? You're charging $50 for a game, you refuse to fix bugs which are worse than game breaking (i can't even start a game for it to break), and you refuse to offer any support at all. Dont waste your money on this, the developer has essentially abandoned the product, and is simply defrauding Steam users purporting that this game works and is actively supported.","March 23, 2015","false","13.4"," 31 of 52 people (60%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","60","31","52","7","3"

It's not just the beautiful graphics/artwork, the handling physics are by far the most advanced too.\nI'm usually a multi-player junkie but at the time of writing this (early access), the MP hasn't been released yet but I've already clocked up more than 115 hours just hot lapping. Not something I've done with any other game.\nIf you like driving games, whether sims or arcade, this is a must buy for you!\nThe developers, Kunos Simulazioni, are a small team of 12 Italian guys with a passion for cars, fast cars. They have out done the competition not only with their product but also with their support in forum, ironing out bugs and issues that have to be expected at beta stage, but also listening to suggestions from the community to make the game better for everyone.\nAll of the cars have been meticulously reproduced to an exacting standard. Telemetry data has been gathered directly from the manufacturers of every single car and applied to the unique physics engine to give the most accurate driving/racing experience possible to date on a PC or console.\nThey have also laser scanned every inch of every track, including Silverstone, Imola, Monza and many more. And thanks to a community vote, laser scanning of Nordschleife is due to start soon for release in Sept 2014!\nAnyway, enough typing from me. It's time to get back to the Ferrari F40 at Imola!","December 28, 2013","true","735.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

Unfortunately that's all it is. And It's not worth 60 dollars.\n\nKunos continues to be opaque with development, and throw tantrums during any criticism on the forums, banning people that complain. I'll sum it up.\n\nOnline:\nNetcode is garbage. It's extremely difficult to join a race. Server browser sucks and doesn't have enough options. It's not as though that matters, because there's nobody playing.\n\nSingle Play:\n\nThe AI is nonexistent, so racing offline is a no. They simply don't recognize the fact that you're there. Smashing in to you in an attempt to stick their pre programmed lines. The penalty system is absurd. Two tires off the track and you'll have your speed cut. Get rammed by the braindead AI? Speed cut. Forced to swerve and cut a corner because the AI doesn't acknowledge you as "there". Speed cut. The Career mode is a joke. It never feels like you're doing anything or progressing in anything.\n\nThere's a time attack mode that is...odd. And pointless, since there's no leaderboards.\n\nSimulation: ALMOST peerless. Everything feels super tight and realistic. The only thing that's lacking is the sound design and force feedback. The forcefeedback is absurdly high by default. You can fine tune this pretty easily, it just takes time. But the game doesn't seem to want to save my settings. I come back to the game to find my degrees of rotation back to a full 900 despite what I have set up in the in game profiler, and the stand alone one I have.\n\nThe UI: Terrible. Everything feels extremely wonky. Once you have everything set up and are ready to drive. I'd say race but again, its a hot lap simulator, it opens it in a SEPARATE INSTANCE. Which makes streaming a nightmare.\n\n\nEven out of early access, and being out for a full year it's worth 30 dollars at best. There's not enough tracks, and not enough cars. There was dlc announced before the game was even released.\n\nThe cars themselves look superb, but everything else looks last gen at best, ps2 era at theworst. This is mostly a problem with usermade tracks so its excuseable.\n\nBecause the PC is starved for sims that have the latest roster of cars, this game is basically a must play. But buy it on sale. It's not worth full price. It wasn't when it was in EA, and it's not worth it now. I wouldn't spend more than 20 dollars on it. Almost every aspect of the game besides the driving feels incomplete or lazy.","October 29, 2015","false","42.6"," 106 of 194 people (55%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","55","106","194","6","11"

And it is a Simulator, which needs some practice and consistence.\n\nThe amount of cars and tracks off-the-box isn't that high, but the quality of them is. Having a look at Spa for example, it's a great detailed and laser-scanned track, which is a sheer pleasure to drive at. Same thing with the stock driving vehicles - it's a reward if you learn to handle them.\n\nOf course, there is no rain like in pCARS, no night or weather at all, not that much eye candy stuff in Assetto Corsa. Kunos SImulazioni focused on the driving and the physics of the vehicles and with that it delivers excellent force feedback on many supported wheels.\n\nProbably the most outstanding thing is the modding community, as it's really active and gets sometimes even featured by KS, which is great. The driving community on the other side is like in almost every other game full of nerds, midskillers and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s alike. Don't expect the best experience, when you join a server with random people in it. ...oh and better wait at Spa and look how they manage to get the first corner after the start ;)\n\nSeriously, it's fun and if you're into cars anyway, check it out!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alex72arma/recommended/244210/","alex72arma","Alex72","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alex72arma/","21 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUpdated!\n\nOld conclusion:\nIn the end there is no need to hesitate if you want a real race sim but didnt know which one to choose or if you want to take a break or step up from race "games" and want the real deal. You found it right here - Assetto Corsa!\n\n**Update**\n\nOk, now i've clocked 500+ hours in Assetto Corsa, and what is my view now? It has changed - for the better.\n\nContent:\nWe got more content since last time. A couple of cars and i think a track (Nurnburg GP). The latest of cars was the 98T - a mechanical monster! Raced in the 80's using carbon fiber and around 1300BHP with a weight of only 540Kg its fair to say its a scary beast, and beautiful modeling and execution regarding physics and FFB. Just as good as the other cars in this sim. The car is a thrill ride.\n\nContent wise we have a good range from street, super cars, GT and formula. And a good amount of laser scanned tracks that got character thanks to the collision layer which adds the bumps/dips/noise that our wheels go over which also translates awesomely to the wheel through FFB. Also worth mentioning is that Kunos landed more licenses and will give us more free content that wasnt promised at start. For one we will get the Corvette C7 included in the price! And a GT version will come in the much anticipated Nordschleife DLC. More about that further down!\n\nMultiplayer:\nLast time i wrote the review there was no multi player - there is now. And although lacking a bit its amazing fun. Funnier than any sim or race game ive done because of the excellent true to life physics and FFB. The new netcode that was just coded in the fluidity is great. Even driving against people across the planet they look smooth and you can have tight races - which is super. Very happy with the netcode upgrade to say the least. We also now have "slipstream" activated in MP which means you can go up behind someone and then get a boost from that cars "air pocket". This changes MP racing a lot!\n\nWe also got FREEJOIN which means you can join in progress and even exit when you feel like it and change car if available (not during race). This is also a huge step up from earlier MP where you chose your car and that was it.\n\nThird good thing is that the admins are getting more and more power to force assists off. This came in the last patches and we can now force damage, fuel and tyre wear so the races get more equal. We are still waiting to be able to force Stability Control, ABS and TC, but im sure its coming very soon. This is where AC is lacking a little atm. Not being able to force all assists off and no real penality system yet. There will be however so its nothing to get hanged up on. Kunos even testing their own build with simple pitstops which was not announced for the 1.0 version. Maybe it wont come, but at least we know they are testing it. Good enough for me. So far they added things that were not scheduled for 1.0 so... :)\n\nGraphics:\nKunos have upgraded the graphics by adding more effects and post processing. You can now make your own filter profiles and switch them while on track! So you tweak a lot of effects such as color, exposure, blur, vignette and a whole range of effects giving amazing results. You can make as many filters as you like and even share them with others. This way you can get great looking graphics without doing yourself but instead download a filter (or more) from someone else. Do you like realistic looking? More saturated with cool effect? Its up to you - you choose. No forcing by the developers. Just like it should be - freedom.\n\nSounds:\nNothing has happened in the sound engine since before, but(!) something IS happening as i write this. Luca, the sound master of Kunos is working hard to implement FMOD into Assetto Corsa! This is basically technology to have lots of effects on each sound. Reverb, occlusion etc. Trust me when i say that the cars will sound amazing when this gets implemented. Because FMOD has a good track record in other games like Forza 5 for example plus a whole range of other games. It will make a huge difference. Looking forward to this big time because sounds are one of the greatest immersion creators in games/sims. Hell, in any entertainment!\n\nMods:\nKunos (the developers) already released the tools for track/cars finalizing, and we already seen lots of tracks and a bunch of cars already. Some of the cars are top notch quality with amazing modeling, phyics and sounds. Some scratch made tracks have been made as well and they are equally amazing. These things take time to create and perfect so we also got a ton of track conversions from other sims/games (with permission) and i dont lie when i say that the track number have exploded! And from here and forward there will be more and more and more. Kunos endorse modding and help any way they can so this title will have a large library of tracks, cars and apps to enjoy.\n\nDLC (or further development of AC):\nSo far the first DLC will be the grand track Nordschleife, and of course its being laser scanned with the latest techniques. Every little dip/bump will be there and every object around the track is in its correct place. This DLC will also feature 10 GT cars. Some of them includes Corvette, RUF and Nissan. There might be more to this DLC, but we have to wait and see. Me and everyone i know is looking forward to it big time. I hope Kunos will be able to sustain themselves by making juicy, meaty DLC's with content we racers want. There is a classic DLC as well i think with SPA and a lot of old powerful cars. Lots to look forward to since Kunos have stated they will improve and build on Assetto Corsa for 5 years!\n\nFinal word:\nAs you can imagine, as a simmer and race fan i cant get enough of AC. Mainly because of the physics and FFB which is at top class. Any sim/race game i try i cant stay long because its miles away from the feeling of AC. This sim feels like driving a real car, and its challening and tons of fun. Races are very intense thanks to that, and its easy to get addicted to the feeling.\n\nKunos goes the extra mile making sure Assetto Corsa will be in the top which we see when they keep adding things that was never on the agenda from start. They keep improving the sim beyond what i thought they would which is amazing. And its taking its time because they are but a few very talented developers, but its worth its wait because the sim is already a meaty excellent driving experience, and i cant wait to see and play it in a couple of months time. Its almost so i want to freeze myself to see how excellent it is in the near future, but at the same time i cant stop playing it so thats a no go. I will just have to continue enjoying myself and take it as it comes. :)\n\nLong review. Im not good at writing them, sorry for that. But i still stand by what i wrote at first. If you want to feel that you drive a REAL car then AC is for you. The driving experience is already there and the details around it is being built up patch by patch. Kunos have impressed me, and im not easy to impress since i require depth and authenticity. Also a big plus is developers who stay close to their customers and listen, and they do. So, im totally sold on this experience and i hope to see you too on the track soon! ;)\n\nPS. the price they ask is low, very low, for a high end product as this one. This is the same type of simulator real car companies use!","December 22, 2013","true","906.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","3"

More content, better graphics, et cetera, but at the core every racing sim should be compared by the one thing they all share in common, the driving model.\n\nAnd this is where AC shines. The feel of the cars on the road are probably the closest any sim has come to replicating real life while importantly staying fun. Cars don't feel overly slippery and lack grip to add extra challenge and frustrate players. On the other hand they aren't glued to the track like arcade racers and can be difficult to control when pushing to the limit. It's a driving model that hooks you in and wants you to get better no matter the car you're in. Assists like traction control, stability control, ABS and driving lines also feature to help newcomers to racing sims get up to speed.\n\nWhile it might be a tad lacking in content in it's current early access state, the commitment to future content is evident and the quality of said content is fantastic. Highly detailed cars, authentic sounds and laser-scanned circuits meaning each official circuit in this game is as close as we'll likely get to actually racing the circuits ourselves. While Project CARS hogs the limelight with it's graphical quality and amount of official content, no car there truly feels as fun to drive there as they do in AC. And AC isn't a bad looking game at all might I add, check the screens and videos for yourself.\n\nTo top it off, this game is also 100% moddable. The amount of custom cars and tracks already available in early access state is staggering and the quality of some of these is incredible. While PCARS might have more base content, it's lack of mod support limits it's future in the community, whereas AC could last for years with new content being released all the time by Kunos and it's playerbase respectively.\n\nSingle player right now is limited to single race weekends and hotlapping, but a career mode of some fashion will appear when the game is fully released. Multiplayer is also constantly improving and already provides for excellent races that can only get better as the netcode is refined and more features are added.\n\nIf you have a wheel, buy this now and you'll have no regrets. If you have a controller and want a racing game that's more challenging than any other racing game, buy this now and you'll have no regrets.","August 26, 2014","true","807.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genname/recommended/244210/","genname","Generic Name","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genname/","97 products in account","In the old days of PC racing games - and by old I don't mean too old but think mid 2000s, there weren't many choices. Sure, there are plenty of arcade racers, but many of them unfortunately were forgotten and relegated to the proverbial dustbin of history (though there are ones that still thrive, like TrackMania and Whiplash). As for more realistic games, there were a few titles PC players could choose from; Simbin with their GTR2 and Race 07 titles, ISI with rFactor, Papyrus (RIP) with Nascar Racing 2003 and even though they were incredibly arcadey, EA's Need for Speed, among others. However, two franchises never came to PC and stayed console only - those being Gran Turismo (for PlayStation), and Forza (for xBox). And PC players, myself included, yearned for a great racing game that had the graphics of those games whilst the level of realism offered by more hardcore games like the SimBin games or rFactor. This isn't to say PC didn't have good games, but what the consoles got was something else altogether.\n\nFast-forward a few years and here we have a game developed by a small Italian firm named Kunos Simulazioni. Their goal was to produce a realistic racing game that has the intricate graphics offered by console games (at least, that's what I gather with this game; I assume that's what the devs were going for). It was given a fancy Italian name because what is more Italian than race cars? I digress, but anway, Assetto Corsa, when it was first released, was eye opening. Who would've thought that a game of this caliper would come to PC? Granted, Kunos aren't exactly a new firm; they did produce NetKar Pro, but I've never played that game, so I cannot say what it is like. However, what I can say about Assetto Corsa is this: it's a really good game, but it does have some issues.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about this game after setting up my race wheel was the force feedback. Holy ♥♥♥♥, the force feedback is incredibly well done. The fact that you can actually feel the road while driving is astounding, and because of this gives me confidence in what the car is doing. Every kerb, every crack in the road is felt but not exaggerated, making playing fun and exciting. It makes rFactor's limited force feedback feel like mushy peas in comparison. I will say this; you might've noticed I said "race wheel." Yes, this is a game that benifits incredibly from a game wheel with force feedback, or at the very least, a controller with force feedback. Keyboard control is possible, but it detracts from the game and using a keyboard removes one of the most highly praised parts of the game.\n\nThe game is more than just force feedback though. What I really like about this game is how easy to drive a good number of cars are. I know a lot of people are going to say "but the GT3 cars should be incredibly twitchy and nervous and blah blah blah" but hear this: GT3 cars are meant for regional racing series (like Blancpain, Super GT GT300, or Dutch Supercar Challenge) and also meant for "gentleman drivers." What is a gentleman driver? Simply put, someone with limited (or in some cases, no) race experience that wants to race. It's no wonder these cars are going to be easier to drive than say, the Lotus 98T or the Ferrari 312T or even the new McLaren F1-GTR. Sure, there are some hard to drive cars in the game; the 3 I mentioned earlier are good examples of that. However, not everything requires superhuman skill to drive. And for that, I give Assetto Corsa high marks.\n\nI also love the tracks; they are incredibly well done and I love the atmosphere that surrounds them. Whether it is something as primitive or "organic" as the Nordschelife or as high tech as the Nurburgring GP circuit, you get a good idea on how the track feels. And finally, no more awkward versions of Spa! The one in this game is one of the most realistic versions out there.\n\nOnto graphics; what can I say? They're great. Just take a look at some screenshots. Kunos has easily matched the graphics level of the console games, with highly detailed car models and tracks. The UI is unobtrusive, though can get a bit clunky trying to select cars and skins. Sounds are for the most part good, though there are some better third party sounds available. I guess that is a good thing since they can be replaced, but by the same token you'd think Kunos would've done good sounds themselves; I guess it was a cost issue. Oh well.\n\nNow the things this game needs fixed, and there are a bunch of them.\n\nFirst is netcode in multiplayer. Quite frankly, it needs reworking. A small tap from one car could send another car flying off like some sort of Newton's Cradle. It's hilarious at first, but there needs something to be done about that. Sure, at high speed having cars bounce off each other in two different directions makes sense but not while the cars are going 20 or so mph. Multiplayer racing, while good for the most part, does need improvement because of that.\n\nSecond is optimization and stability, which this game needs. I know piling on mod after mod can make the game more unstable, but ever since the game started using FMOD for sounds I have been having more and more sound crashes, making playing a sort of ticking time bomb. It especially sucks when you're on a great hotlap and suddenly the game goes six feet under. Optimization is sorely needed as well. I understand with the Dream Pack update there were CPU optimizations brought in, which is great, but there need to be graphic ones as well.\n\nThird is the general state of the game. And I don't mean "Is this game going to die out or not" because right now I feel that Kunos is doing its best to keep the game ship shape. However, what direction does Kunos want to take this game in? As a hotlap game, it's great, but put any sort of AI racing and it's quite frankly subpar. Multiplayer has its own issues to deal with, and on top of that the game has probably one of the most insipid penalty systems in any racing game. Going off track - even if there is no advantage gained - grants you either a 10 second penalty OR you have to slow down to 30MPH. This is incredibly dumb and in multiplayer situations it can lead to some stupid crashes. I know the first thing people will say is "well don't go off track" but let's face it; you are bound to go off track sooner or later. But back to what this game wants to be; does it want to become the next rFactor? the next Gran Turismo/Forza? Or both? It is hard to say, and maybe Kunos doesn't know either.\n\nIn all, this is a great racing game, and is a breath of fresh air that PC players desperately needed. The collection of cars and tracks is great, and the modding community is thriving, producing some content that rivals the stock content. Would I recommend buying it? Yes, but if it's on sale with the DLC as well. And when Kunos does fix the issues and takes the game in whatever direction they choose, the game will be on every PC racer's bucket list to play.","March 24, 2015","true","163.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Single line race and easy to predict. Easy to get first place. Dont even have to finish the race. Get in first place and just stop in front of the other cars and watch them retire. Then you can retire and walla.\n\nMutiplayer: (sigh) This is where it all goes wrong! I was hoping for a very fast pace join in and race game. This is not it. Join in and watch peeps screw off is more like it. Trying to get the feel for the track/qualifying is a problem simply due to the other people. There are always people crashing into you for fun.  Starting  a race can take up to 20 mins before any magic starts to happen, and when it finally does start, you got those peeps that are not serious and want to crash. I thought thats what GTA is for. Over all It doesnt take long before I sign into a another game and have a dissapointed view of this game.\n\nTHE FIX: Dont play this game, Play a different one. (For me at least).

I was looking for a game that gave me a "realistic" feel in terms of acceleration, braking, turning, road feel etc.\n\nAsseto Corsa delivered with flying colours or shall I say my Thrustmaster TX did? Actually no, I've played a few "arcade" / semi simulated games and this by far gives you the best force feedback as if you were driving on a real road surface (I haven’t Project Cars but i read the reviews for both before choosing Asseto Corsa.. the consensus was that AC had a more realistic feel).\n\nInterestingly I decided to use my real life car around the track but had opportunity to coach with an amateur rally driver. He gave my some tips when cornering/braking for turns. That worked well on the real life track so I thought I would apply the exact same concept to Asseto Corsa... Before my "real life" lesson, the Nürburgring (Tourist)I was hitting around 7.30ish with the 599 XX (admittedly that was slow in general)... When I applied real life track day tips, my time reduced to around 6.58. Let that be the testament of translating real-life driving to their in-game physics engine are phenomenal. Whenever I play AC, it DOES feel like I'm driving a real car.\n\nThat said it does just feel like when you play online, you are just competing to show off lap-times so it can get very tiresome if you encounter some of the “professional drivers in Asseto Corsa who take the game extremely seriously..”\n","December 20, 2015","true","52.5"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","12","18","2","0"

Okay so let me put it this way in level of realism from lowest to highest  Project Cars> Assetto Corsa > Iracing. Iracing is in fact the MOST realistic sim out there in terms of physics, handling, and car behaviour in general due to its laser  scanning and ultra realistic tire models so thats what you would get if you were 100% serious about sim racing (I have all 3 of these sims). Unfortunately its not budget having to pay for cars tracks and subscriptions so the next best thing for simmers is this. The physics arent as good as Iracing but they are waaayyy more realistic than Pcars. The graphics also being pretty decent with being slightly better than Iracing (Iracing has AMAZING reflections on the cars). If your just starting out this is good game for you to get into sim racing (YOU NEED A WHEEL TO SIM RACE) if you have something like a G27. I'm not rich so when I upgrade I can't get any direct drive wheels ($2000 each) so I'm getting a fanatec after being in the sim racing community for a while. So I'm going to kinda do a comparison for all of you here of all three games to see what best suits you. I have been playing sim games since GT Legends (thats where I started) so I'm pretty aquainted with racing games by now and you can trust my info on this though this is not my most playes sim racer.\n\nPcars\n\n-Best Graphics\n-Arcade physics\n-Decent Tracks\n-Large track variety\n-Most Cars (no mods)\n-Well modeled cars\n-No Mod support\n-Controler recomended\n-Offline play\n-Decent Price\n-Good for fun\n\nAssetto Corsa\n\n-Middle Graphics\n-Semi Sim physics\n-Decent tracks\n-Decent track Variety\n-2nd most cars (no mods)\n-Well modeled cars\n-Mod support\n-Controler not recomended\n-Offline Play\n-Decent Price\n-Good for begining simmers\n\nIracing\n\n-Worst graphics (of the three)\n-Full blown sim physics\n-Laser scanned tracks (realistic)\n-Decent Track Variety\n- Least cars (No mods)\n-Extremely detailed cars\n-No mod support\n-Controler Not recomended\n-No offline play\n-Expensive\n-Good for experienced simmers\n\nI hope this helped all who read have a better grasp on these games to make a wise decision on what they shoudl buy based on what they need and what these three sims have to offer.

The physics are a bit unforgiving if you drive beyond your limits, as it should be. Furthermore, the graphics look wonderful (Use the Glide filter to prevent brightness adjustment, by the way) and the selection of cars both mod and official are pretty decent.\n\nAs a racing game in today's market, it's not that great. Single-player AI is pants-on-head stupid, the track selection is incredibly small, and multiplayer is almost entirely unplayable at 200+ ping. Official leagues don't exist, public lobbies are filled with idiots, and you'll rarely ever find a good room of people using any of the more interesting disciplines, like the Lotus Eleven.\n\nIf you are a racing simulation enthusiast, this is a decent choice for you. I love driving the Mercedes 190E DTM around the Nordschleife, right where it belongs. The tracks are all very well done, and some of the mod tracks and cars are unbelievably fun and/or to AC's laser-scanned standards. Lake Louise is a fun loop around the Canadian Rockies, and Bridgehampton is just as bumpy as you'd expect a race track situated in Long Island to be. You can drive a Supercharged Cobra 427, but you can grab the mod with the Competition and Street versions as well. There's also a very good NA Miata mod.\n\nIf you are anything but an enthusiast, maybe hold off until there is a bigger selection of cars and tracks, or find a different sim to play. I can't recommend this game because SPR is almost broken and MPR is unplayable, if not frustrating.","December 22, 2015","false","44.4"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","17","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRaazberry/recommended/244210/","TheRaazberry","Raj","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRaazberry/","72 products in account","This review is more for controller users:\n\nAssetto Corsa is nothing short of fantastic. Physics are phenomenal, even at an alpha state. Graphics are very good, and the gameplay customisibility(modding support) are just great bonuses to the game. I have tried this out on a G27 on my friends account and the steering wheel is obviously the preferred way to play this game. Nothing will match that in terms of preciseness and accuracy to actually driving the real thing.\n\nNow for controllers. I have an Xbox One controller. When I first played the game, it gave me the CPU occupency level of over 95%. I can tell that it's just a bug and the work around for it, while it is tedious, is completely fine. Just set the Xbox One Controller as a steering wheel and manually map out the commands. Xbox 360 Controllers already have a profile so it's good to go, but if you have an Xbox One controller, it's best to manually set it up, until the future patches come in enabling full support of the XOne.\n\nGameplay with the controller : This game is just straight up difficult with the controller unless you sink in a lot of hours, fiddle with the setup and find a good setup. I am about 3-6 seconds slower than a wheel time that I see on YouTube on Monza, depending on the car. Keep in mind this should get better once I understand the corners, braking points, and set ups to how the cars work as I move forth with the game. Is the game playable with the controller? Simple answer: Yes. There are people who say it isn't but it is playable. You just need to have patience and fiddle with the settings ALOT to find your "cup of tea." After that, you will get better. I assure you.\n\nIf you buy this game and you have a controller, be patient. Don't give up. Stay focused on your driving and be ready to troubleshoot your errors like no other. This is an amazing driving simulator. It is not an arcade game. Give feedback to the developers about your controller settings and just keep on at it. You will learn to love this game. I know it\n\nWheel users, do yourself a favor and buy this game. What are you waiting for? Stop reading this review. You shouldn't have been reading it. You have a wheel. This is a simulator. It's like PB and J, Cookies and Cream, Cheese and Pizza. If you're not into that stuff, just know this. Your wheel will love the game more than you do.\n\n9/10 (Due to controller support but it should be fixed in the upcoming patches).\n\nHappy Driving :)\n\n***Edit as of 12/23/2014*** The game is out as a 1.00 release, and while to some, it doesn't feel like a complete release, it is definitely WAYYY better than it was when I did this review. The controller issue got fixed for me so the game is a beauty to play. This is a must have for driving enthusiasts.","June 30, 2014","true","27.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The handling of each vehicle so far is amazing.  I have played a lot of driving games, barring full sim games like RFactor, and you really can feel each wheel through the steering wheel.  You can instantly feel which rear wheel is stepping out and can react accordingly before it is to late.  The in cab camera view is spot on.  The way it tilts into the corners is sublime.  It is so well done you don't even notice it, which to me means it is just right.\n\nI play this with my G27 with a brake modification and everything just works perfectly.  It is one of the very few driving games I haven't had to spend hours calibrating.\n\nI have one very minor gripe, which I add is a personal thing, I find the menu system quite clunky and a little unclear in what you are setting up.  Having said that this game is still in early development and i wouldn't be surprised if this is revised at some point.\n\nAbsolutely love it.

It's not the top simulation on the market, but it is a great stepping stone for those looking to move beyond simcade games into something  more realistic. While playable with a contrroller, you definitely want a full force feedback wheel to get the most out of this one. Below I will go over the pros and cons in a bit more detail:\n\nPros    -the graphics look fantastic, and it isn't too demanding on your PC to get a beautiful looking race environment\n- the physics, while not mind blowing, are more than sufficient to provide decent racing, and fun driving, particularly the road cars. Definitely leaps and bounds above what gran Turismo, Forza and PCars are doing in this department\n-the car selection is great. While other games have done race cars to death, Assetto Corsa has the best selection of road cars around, from Ferraris to Mustangs and everything in between. It also has race cars, but the road cars really stand out, and with the above average physics and great graphics, it really makes for a truly immersive experience\n-the laser scanned tracks are extremely detailed and stunning to look at, really bringing the experience together\n-BEST.DRIFTING.ANYWHERE......yes, you can drift here. Yes, it is awesome\n-Force feedback isn't the best on the market by any means, but it gives you a good idea of what your car is doing and will help you master the art of controlling it. Still, above average and better than most everything other than GSCE and RFactor 2\n-Updates. Kunos is always updating and improving Assetto Corsa, along with releasing more content. We are on Tire Model 7, and have had 3 dlc packs, free content, and have more being relesed all the time. Japan pack today!!!\n-The mods. This title has a great modding community behind it, many modders carried over from RFactor, who put out tons of quality content. The mods work great here, and much of the time are indistinguishable from stock content\n\nCons     -The sounds are far from perfect, and a greater range is needed (a bit bland, need to work on the highs and lows for the growls and whines of real cars). UPDATE: The Japan pack is a step in the right direction, and with a high quality set of headphones, they actually have quite decent range\n-The AI started off as some of the worst anywhere, slow and stupid. They have since greatly improved, but they still need a good bit of work. Sometimes they are randomly aggressive, but can end up in a train, "racing" single file if your unlucky. It's hard to find a good match for your skill level, 98% I beat them on most tracks, 100% and I rarely see them beyond lap 3\n-The online competition. I can't really fault Kunos for this, but while better than the Gran Turismo/Forza crowd, you still do get a lot of noobs and wreckers. I think it's mostly because, as I mentioned before, Assetto Corsa is used as a stepping stone from racing games to true simulations. Maybe I am just spoiled  from iRacing and RFactor 2 Leagues, but I am yet to have a race where half the field is still racing by lap 5. It could really do with a skill matching/ranked racing system.\n\nAs you see, the pros far outweigh the cons, and Assetto Corsa is a worthy purchase for any sim racer or car afficianado. With a sense of realism foreign to most gamers, it will have you kicking the backend around corners and fighting to gain each second. It still is far from perfect, and I still prefer RFactor 2 physics, and iRacing's competitive racing, but to just hop in a dream car like a Ferrari 458 or Corvette Stingray and tear up the track, Assetto Corsa reigns supreme. And with the constant inprovements, updates and new content being released all the times, who knows what the future of this title holds.  A solid 8/10 from me.","May 17","true","252.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I'm in my mid 40's with a family so can't spend day in day out practicing. I've driven the real Nordschleife 'tourist' circuit in a Jaguar XF Sport with other real cars on track too. (I'd like to see complete random cars on track, that start in random positions of the circuit when you do a free practice for added realism!)\n\nI got this game on early access (and spent most of my time on Monza until the Nurburgring made it's glorious appearance.)\n\nSo this review is ONLY based on a comparison for aforementioned track. I run a Crossfire R290 reference setup on a 32GB Asus ROG Tytan (i7-4970)  so graphically, my setup should handle anything and everything I throw at it.\n\nAssetto Corsa looks great, Project CARS looks a bit greater however the ForceFeedback on PCars is awful.

The only way I could get round a corner without crashing would be to take it slow, and everyone would overtake me, so I' ended up coming in last. But I realised that actually selecting Pro driver setup, as opposed to Gamer or Racer, actually made it easier. The car is more responsive. I think it's because it turns off things like traction conrol and ABS, which are designed to stablise the car and end up making it too rigid to drive fast. Just thought I'd share my experience, select Pro and this game is awesome. Love the detail and accuracy that's gone into the cars, inside and out. (Now) love the realistic handling. Love the tracks. And love the community. Looking forward to driving all the cars on all the tracks and seeing it develop over time.","February 1, 2015","true","78.5"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","11","17","2","0"

The great graphics, suspension of the car, feedback in the wheel and diversity so far make Assetto Corsa one of the best simulation racing games for me at this very moment.\n\nI've been searching for a "fun" simulation racing game at this moment. And what i can say is that most of the realistic simulation racing games don't care about the user experience and only care about the realism and handling of the car. Assetto corsa does both. I love the way that the game looks and how the menu works so far, even tho it's still in beta I already know this game is going to be great. Instead of playing other simulation racing games i only play Assetto Corsa now. It's quite more addicting than the others because of the user experience.\n\nI can't say alot more about this game now, because there are some things that still need some work, and since it's still in development i can't say too much about the bad parts.\n\n\nIf you like sim racing make sure you buy this title, I highly recommend it!\n","November 27, 2013","true","126.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Main lacks are: AI, damage model and multiplayer. But hey!, it's 0.4 version.\nIf you want to test your skills, fight with yourself trying to beat best time - this early build is for you.\nCar handling in my opinion is better than in SHIFT2 and SimBin games (Race 07, RaceRoom). You can feel every angle of a track. Every car is different and it takes time to learn how to drive it. Also you have to learn every single track or you will spend more time on the roadside. At this moment AC shows its all pros. You just want to learn. Sit in one car on one track and drive for several hours until reach perfect lap.\nXbox game pad gives much joy (I don't have race wheel) even with almost all aids off.\nForce feedback effect works perfectly. Also responsiveness of analog stick and sensivity of LT RT are very good.\nGraphics and sound depends on taste but I like them.\n\nAssetto Corsa is closer to Race 07 than SHIFT2 but I think it defeats them both.\nI have no comparision to Project C.A.R.S. so I can't tell which game is better.

At first I found It really challenging, not because its hard to play it just takes a little getting used to. I bought the game early in it's release and have seen it grow from strength to strength.  You have to drive the vehicles as you woul in real life, with care. If you are not careful the game will punish you and you will not enjoy it.\n\nI highly reccomend this to anyone who has patience to learn to race properly. It's not a game for you if all you want to do is put your foot flat to the floor and hope for the best. It takes time and a lot of effort to become any good.\n\n10/10 for me love it!\n\nEdited 15/02/2015.\n\nAfter putting many more hours into both single player and muliplayer i thought i would add a few more thoughts.\n\nI was playing a lot of GRID AUTOSPORT and was really enjoying it, then a friend put me onto F1 racing and I then spent many hours with F12013/14. I found my self suckered into the thrill of "getting it right". I would occasionally jump into ASSETTO and race a few single player events and challenges, then i thought I would look at the multiplayer. I was blown away bu what i found.\n\nThe multiplayer community was much more attentive to the "Don't go flat out and crash at the first corner rule". People seemd to me on the whole to be taking the races with an attitude that would mirror real life events, don't get me wrong there were still those who were flogging it however there were much less of them. When and if you get onto the right server (MARTY CERVIN servers come to mind) the people that flogged it were warned and if they didn't change were banned. It made a much more enjoyable experience.\n\nI managed to work out how to run my own server so now i also have control over everything. As well I looked into the modding community and found that to be very alive and kicking. Have even found the V8 Supercars and Australian racing tracks. Bathurst is a much harder track in ASSETTO compared to the GRID AUSTOSPORT version.\n\nThis has now become my go to racing game and I am looking forward to updating my tech to include the oculas rift purley for this game. lately they have released more updates and fixes which continue to improve the already wonderful game it is.\n\nCheers","November 28, 2014","true","306.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It seems like you've struck a perfect balance between playability and realism.

Graphics, I prefer iRacing style, AC seems somewhat sterile and artificial a bit like Grand Turismo.

Well, the easiest place to start would be to stop calling it a game, because it's not. It's a simulation, and a very good one at that. What's the difference, you might ask? Well, lets think of a racing "game", Forza seems to be a good choice. In Forza, you have hundreds of cars to choose from, but they all feel relativly the same when you drive them. Assetto Corsa's car list is absolutley miniscule by comparison, but each of those very few cars handles and feels differently than any other car. Because of this, you can spend hours getting one car to go around a track perfectly, then switch cars and have to do it all over again. If you find that fun, go ahead and pick this up. If you don't find re-learning each individual car fun, just pick one you like and stick with it, because in all honesty, you probably aren't going to own a Pagani Huyra in your life or a Ferrari F40, and even if you do get to own one of those cars, you still won't be able to take it to tracks around the world and race it to your heart's content.\n\nWhat else... car tuning. If you like tuning cars to try and get every possible horsepower out of them, go ahead and pick this game up. For each car, you can change the tire pressure, tire compound, brake bias, wheel camber, the gearbox settings, the list just keeps going on. And each of the things you change can have a profound effect on how well the car goes around the track.  It's absolutley incredible.\n\nAnother thing are the challenges:\n\nThere are pre-defined races, hotlaps, a drift mode,  two drag strips, and if you get bored with those, you can just make up your own races with whatever cars you feel like. There's enough content included in this pre-release version of the game for almost infinite playability, and more stuff is being added with each update, ranging from more cars, to new tracks, to new challenges. Again, it's incredible.\n\nNow for some bad things:\n\nThis is an early access game, and some things still need to be worked on. The AI on opponents can be a little rough around the edges, some tracks have weird physics errors attached to them, multiplayer has yet to be implemented, and weather has not yet been included. If you have a problem with any of those things, wait a little while for the game to be updated, and have all those things worked out, and then spend your money.\n\nSecondly, you basically need a steering wheel. Although it's possible, playing with a keyboard just won't give you the same feeling as using a wheel, and it just won't be as fun. If you're in a pinch money-wise or otherwise, an xbox 360 controller can be used, and it's still better than a keyboard, but a wheel truiumphs over all.\n\n\nIn conclusion, unless you're the type of person who absolutley hates racing games in general, you will probably find something fun in this game that will keep you coming back. If you can get past the fact it's an early access and somethings haven't been included yet, it's very easy to have fun playing this.","April 14, 2014","true","59.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

That comes with it's perks: I have a great group of friends who share my passion. So, I had to buy this game (Peer pressure, yay!) and when I fired it up, I wasn't dissapointed.\nTo those wh don't know: The last proper simracing game (Not counting Iracing since it's subscription based and therefore has no real release date) is from 2007 (CARS is too arcadey), which is Race 07 and costs 3 euro's on Steam.\n\nThe game is easy to get used to for a simracer who knows what he's doing. In the controls menu, you'll find the regular settings, and a configuration tool to help the clueless.\nSo far, there's no AI (The makers hope to release that in the next update partially) and no multiplayer, which leaves you to do special events, drag race, drift, practice, and hot lap around several tracks, including Monza and Imola.\nThe tracks look lovely and feel realistic. The same goes for the cars; The cars feel real, which is exactly what simracers as myself want.\nI could see this becoming an E-sports game if the multiplayer is well executed, and it's great to see the attention this game has gotten.\nPeople who like features like rewinding are probably going to end up dissapointed, because this is pure simracing. 1 big mistake, and you're out.

This game is NOT complete, if you have brought it wanting and expecting a £35.00 (At the time of writing) game, then you are going to be dissapointed. Don't let them fool you this IS still in early acsess.\nA list of things that are broken:\n\nMost conserningly for a 'complete' game, the A.I is the worst I have seen in a racing game in along time. They do not know where you are on the track, and will in effect ram you off the road by overtaking in the worst points. This also means that the career is only possible if you are on easy and some kind of God. Also it makes any race very annoying. I may not be the greatest driver, but getting more than third in most races in impossible.\n\nThe down-shifting is broken. It will wait untill the car is at 3000 RPM untill it changes down.\n\nYou need a wheel, otherwise it is unplayable, meaning it in NOT a relaxing game to sit down and play.\n\nThere are some, good things, one major thing is that the handling physics ARE good, but you will only get 20 hours gameplay max from hot-lapping.\n\nMy outcome is that this game is to damn expencive.\n\n(P.S I do relise that the dev's put alot of hard word into this game, and I think that this game, whilst in my OPINION is not the greatest at the moment this COULD be an exquisit game. It just not worth £35.00 yet. I will continue following this game and I will change this Review when the next big update comes out)\n\nAlso my wheel's rotation sensor is broken, but this is the ONLY game in my Steam game list that does not fix this temporarly, meaning on this game, 90% of the time I have to go through long lists to get force feedback working properly, taking sometimes upto 30 mins to fix this, EVEN GTA 5 DOES THIS!","January 24, 2015","false","72.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

Unfortunately i cant recommend this game except to the most hardened driving simulation fans and even they will suffer at some point from the absolute perfect driving of the A I . This isnt even mentioning when the AI wish to pass you on a corner etc the answer seems to be quite simple - rear end you , this leaves you ( not them at any point i noticed ) careening onto the grass / track edge for a penalty or slow down to 50kmh ( something you would expect to find in an arcade game with catch up enabled! .\n\nUnfortunately this games just feels like an exercise in stress. I will commend the team for improving the overall driving experience since the early access but the A I simply hasnt been well adjusted.\n\nAnother unusual presence in this game is the career mode choices , a time trial just for "the fun of it" seems to be thrown into career mode, whilst i can understand this gives you chance to practice the track before engaging in a race so does practice ( thats kind of what its there for ) .\n\nI think ultimately the developers need to understand that whilst there are many hardened sim racers out there who will thoroughly enjoy most of this experience they have ultimately sold themselves short by not creating a particularly enjoyable experience.\n\nIf you are willing to invest a lot of time of the steep difficulty curve and love racing sims then get it.

I play it mainly because of the Lotus 49. It's an amazing car and the graphics are really nice. The Monza 1966 track is also a very beautiful track to race on. But the car is the only one from that era and the track is the only track from that F1-era. The feeling is good and racing is nice, but it lacks the experience of being a racing driver who aims at becoming F1 champion. Racing against the same F1 cars (only the livery is different), having only one historical accurate track, without the need for pitstops, isn't enough to lure F1 fans.\n\nSo, racing with the Lotus 49 on the Monza 1966 is more of a snack, and it made me even more hungry for a good and finished vintage F1 racing game.

I, unfortuantly, do not own a wheel, so this review comes from a gamepad standpoint.\n\nOverall, this game is brilliant. There isn't a better way to put it, and to get it for $20 was even better. I really appreciate the level of detail in each car, and each track. Driving them though can be annoying and not too entertaining. Get everything right though, and it's a memorable experience.\n\nThe controls are the biggest drawback here. Like I said above, unless you own a wheel, you are not going to have a great time. I spent quite a bit of time just tweaking settings trying to get everything to an acceptable level. Even now I am not thrilled with the control layout and feel I currently have.\n\nBack to the cars, and the game. The menu can be a bit confusing at start, and the depht of cars isn't great. Tracks suffer the same thing too. The cars though are models very well, although I cannot comment on the accuracy of the physics models behind each one.\n\nIf you are looking for a good racing game, Assetto Corsa is one that has a lot of potential, but don't expect to be immediatlly thrilled by it. It takes time, and a lot of tweaking, to really make the most out of this game. Once you get past that though, there is a lot of fun to be had.","June 27, 2014","true","48.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Although the game is "pre release" it's astonishing what you get when buying this game.\n\nTalking about me and my expectations:\nI love driving bikes and cars real world. I also like this "simulated". Over the last 15 years (or so) I recognised that there is no "Moped-" (==motobike-) simulation which will work for me. Driving cars in our days is simulated in an acceptable manner.\n\n"In real world" I love driving lightweight cars.\nDriving @home I use a Playseat and a Steering Wheel. (Logitech G27 on PC, the old Logitech Wheel on the XBox 360)\n\nWhat I want: I don't want to race (online/offline) I want TRACKDAY-driving.\n\nMy main problem is (was?) that the physics is some kind of morbid running the most existing PC Simulations.\n\nAs I tried a lot my favorite at the moment is Forza 5 on XBox 360. Using PC simulations like "Race Room" my major issue is that these Programs to me do not feel like "driving a real car"! The behavior of my wheel (Logitech G27) is crap, especially when the car oversteers. - Forza 5 does this much more than all other (PC- or PS-) games I tried before. The problem playing this is (mainly) that the Wheel (Logitech Drive Fx) is crap...\n\nPlaying Assetto Corsa for about 1/2 an hour to me was a really great experiance! The Lotus Elise on track behaves like a Lotus Elise driven on Track... ;->\n\nSO now my whishes for the further development:\n- please(!!!) add the "Nürburgring Nordschleife"\n- add any other tracks\n- enhance the physics\n- enhance the FF (Forced Feedback) for the Logitech G27\n\nThe FF of the G27 is my only (little) issue. Hitting the curb is somehow a little "lazy-implementet". I'm sure this will be fixed... ;-)\n\nLooking from my point of view any kind of KI or Races or what else doesn't matter...\n\nOVERALL: THANX to the developers for this wonderful simulation!\n\nP.S.: Preferred Tracks to be added:\n- Hockenheim (all Tracks)\n- Infineon Raceway\n- Suzuka\n- AND: of course the "Nürburgring Nordschleife"... ;-)","March 7, 2014","true","23.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In games like GRID or Forza, excitement comes from winning races and the drive to keep playing derives from the carrot on a stick that is the credits you need to earn to buy more cars.\nAC doesn't even have a carrot on a stick for winning races yet (career mode is not yet done), and I still regularly start it up just to do hotlapping sessions of various car/track combinations. The driving is just that much fun in and of itself, and incredibly challening at that.\n\nOnline racing is also remarkably fun to do, and once you escape inevitable turn 1 malarky, most racers will happily battle you for position turn after turn with courtesy and giving you your space while you give them theirs. It seems most people enjoy a having great and tense battle more than winning it, and that allows for them to take place cleanly. Most people rather see their opponent win it and have another chance to be a hero in the next few turns, than risk hitting them and ending up in the gravel together.\n\nThere are a few glaring omissions such as pit stops and better ways of getting in a public race (the booking system makes sense, but it could use some more options to allow e.g. joining in practice mode),  but even if they stop development entirely I feel as though I've gotten more than my money's worth already. And so far, they've done the contrary and maintained a fairly strong update/patch schedule every other Friday.","June 28, 2014","true","745.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I have tried it with an controller, but didn't manage to get a setup I was able to drive with. I have seen others be able to drive with a controller, so there is hope, even tho this game is ment to be played with a wheel.\n\nI haven't tested online since it was new, so I can't really tell you anything about the online part, except for that it was qutie buggy when it first came out (a long time ago).\n\nBut just driving around famous circouts in famous cars is a lot of fun! All the cars need different techniques to get the most out of them, and you really get a sense of mastering the car, the more you drive it. I have many hours, screaming at my screen and the game, when I have done parts of the lap close to perfect, just to over reach near the end, ending up crashing.\nI crash a lot. All the time really. Every third lap in some cars. Which is part of the fun!\n\nSince I have pretty much been broke since Project Cars finally was release, I can't really comapre them, but even if you have Project cars, this game is a worthwhile investment!\n\nThe positive:\n\n-Great sound\n-Great grapich\n-Realistic driving performance and handling\n-Laser scaned tracks, for optimal realism\n-Costs less then a single track day\n\nThe negative:\n\n-You can't use any buttons on the G27 to navigate the menues. This means I have to get up everytime I need to do a pitstop, and can ruin AI play as well.\n-The AI is a bit clucky (or was at least, might have become better)\n-Career mode isn't all that great.

Assetto just blows the rest out of the water. There's a depth of realism to this game thats missing from most. It also runs humbly on my old-ish machine (i5, 8gb, gtx460), reaching 100 frames on medium settings. Realism features in other games can often detract and make you drive worse, the realism features in this game actually make you drive better for it. The multiplayer is excellent. The developers have a tight relationship with the community, fixing and changing issues people dislike (like the booking system previously). It also has a traditional sort of feel, you open the game, refresh a server list and join. No silly monthly membership fees or restrictions like skill levels before joining a game. And the game has a bustling modding community, which is just such a boost. There's a plethora of custom cars and tracks thats increasing by the day. My only gripe with this game is some aspects of the menus/settings, in terms of look and feel. But to be honest, if they said (for interests sake) that I need to run Windows 95 or something crazy to play this game, I probably would, its that good. I enjoyed and played Race07 quite a lot. This game feels like it picked up where Race07 left off and just made it so much better. If you're a car guy, you have to buy this game, its worth every penny and much more.","February 5, 2015","true","249.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Assetto Corsa is still in alpha/beta and it's already setting standards in the racing fanatics' community. Having a wheel with this game is a must, as is having a screen as large as possible if a correct and accurate FOV is desired. A triple monitor setup is highly recommended.\n\nThe physics are absolutely amazing; they set the bar for other racing games for sure.\n\nCons so far: relatively few tracks, but more are in the way. Please add classic tracks like Laguna Seca, Eastern Creek, and Nurburgring Long, Kunos!\n\nAlso, the car roster needs to be expanded. But Kunos is hard at work licensing more cars, as far as I'm aware.\n\nFinally, a "con" for many people would be the very fact that this is a simulator. It is very unforgiving to arcade racing "technique," like flooring the gas pedal during curves or overshooting curves. That is, of course, if your pride makes you turn off the in-game assists, since this game is really easy for casual/newbies if you turn on assists.\n\nThanks for reading, and yes, I highly recommend this game to racing fans.","July 13, 2014","true","32.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

And if you don't get it in early access, you'll be kicking yourself for a long time.\n\nAssetto Corsa - My personal favorite racing simulator. The only thing that comes close to how fun this game is, is Richard Burns Rally. We're talking incredibly detailed content, a burgeoning modding community and soon to come, the first ever laser-scanned Nurburgring Nordschleife. This game will replace Forza, Gran Turismo, rFactor, Live For Speed once development is completed.\n\nWe may not be able to alter the default cars just yet, but I'm damn sure that Kunos will find it in their hearts to work car customization into the game very soon. Community-created vehicles have already been equipped with a primitive customization system. Modification in general is VERY simple. You can edit the files freely. For someone like myself who has no modding experience, I have managed to download all of my favorite tracks and cars with ease. I've also been able to edit the .ini files to customize transmission, suspension and engine files to my liking.\n\nThis game will rise to the heights that rFactor and Live For Speed achieved years ago. It will surpass them (in my opinion, it already has) in terms of community involvement.\n\nWhether you love to race, drift or simply drive.

Now, I haven't actually driven any of the cars included in the game in reality, but the fact is the feel right. I play this with a Logitech Driving Force GT and I used a simple gamepad before that, and even then it felt like driving, plain and simple.\nThe handling, sounds and feel of the game are fantastic. You can really feel the difference with the laser scanned tracks and every little bump is noticable. Cars behave and sound like cars, and the interiors are gorgeously detailed. There are a few issues with it at the moment since it's currently in beta (I had my car once do a forward flip after I braked heavily and the nose went into the road) but things are improved every patch.\n\nI can't say enough good things about this. It's a true driving simulator and it's hours and hours of fun, though I would strongly reccomend using a wheel with this.\n\nNote: If you're after a "game" this probably won't enjoy you.

Assetto Corsa absolutely delivers the real thrill of being behind the wheel of a car. There aren't so many vehicles and tracks to choose from yet, but the ones that are available at the moment - are recreated with maximum detail and with true passion. And more downloadable content is on the way!\nAs to the physics, only iRacing can compete with this game in my opinion - the driving is simply phenomenal. The fact that the development team uses real performance data from car manufacturers puts the experience to a higher level, you can easily lose yourself in this simulation for hours straight.\nAnd the graphics are gorgeous, especially if you have pc-horsepower to crank up all the video settings. Cockpit cam is superb, the quality of the interiors is second to none. I recommend playing it in 3D with a good FFB wheel.\nIn a word, this is a must have for all racing fans.

So i can finally drift properly because this game has also one of the best driving models i have ever seen. It feels so good to drive Lotus 49 on Monza from '66. And try to beat that unbeatable time record. If you love driving for fun go for it. If you want awesome multiplayer experience... This is where the game is not that good. Penalty system is really bad. You just get for a bit of track and you get 5 seconds penalty. In wich you are unable to accelerate or you can drop down to 50km/h and then go on full throttle again. The race as itself in multiplayer doesn't look even like a normal race. Yes, everyone starts from grid. But the race itself is based on time. I think that on one side it's nice idea. But they should atleast give us a feature to make that normal race in wich depends your position. Because that makes your choices limited. In that case you cant just do in one lap stupidities. Then man up. Just teleport back to pits. and then go the fastest lap and simply win. I want that exciting moment in wich I fight for first place.\n\nAnother problem, drivers... I mean in online. The AI are still a bit dull because they ram you same like normal players. "Oh, gotta brake a little, this turn is sharp." And at this moment some jackass bounces from your side to go as fast as he can and you end up in a haystack... And in the end they kick you for staying in way... So, one thing. If you are not gonna play online with your friends. I suppose don't play online. Of course I'm not saying that you shouldn't buy this game. If you are only thinking about it... Go for it! Now! You can customize cars suspension, aerodynamics. Brake bias. Engine limiter, so you can take it to insane RPM's and the engine will hate itself during shifts. Oh, I love this game. Even though i got just 20.4 hours right now. But It's mostly because I'm bored of taking my wheel on table and back to the side. I'd have like 50 hours right know. (And it's also because I play a lot of games, not just one. I'll get bored other way)\n\n+ I love to hear that the game is still being furthermore developed. The new dream pack sounds really like dream. In the trailer you can see McLaren P1, Lamborghini, but for me, there is Alfa Romeo 4C. I love that car.\nThe flag system is finally coming, no more crashers/rammers! :D\nThe weather/winter is coming (not sure if winter is gonna be available but I had to do that)\nAI are getting an update\nJust get this game if you LOVE sims.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pdevans/recommended/244210/","pdevans","|H|H| TT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pdevans/","123 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAssetto Corsa attempts to strike a balance between simulation and casual racer. The team at Kunos Simulazioni have a passion for all things automotive, and it shows with AC's eclectic mix of road vehicles, lightweight sports cars, open wheelers and full on track machines.\n\nThis is a beta release, so much of the content and features are still to come. But the cars, tracks and challenges available at this point in the development of Assetto Corsa should keep armchair racers happy for a while. The game feels like a gentleman's racer, a laid back title with a subtlety not usually associated with a racing sim. Think Chris Harris rather than Clarkson.\n\nWhen you start the game, no one is shouting at you to drive this and race that with a soundtrack pounding you steadily into submission. You choose what you want to drive, where to race and whom to race against. Menu design is intuitive and is easily navigable. It's a welcome return to when interfaces had function to them with icons and text used to great effect.\n\nPick your car. Choose your track. Go Race. The fun is learning the nuances of each vehicle and trying to exploit them trackside. The Ferrari 599XX EVO is a vastly different beast from the Abarth 500 EsseEsse for example, but each offer their own challenges and provide their own rewards. Take your time to appreciate each car in its own right and you'll begin to enjoy racing for fun again. Driving a lightweight Lotus around a tight, twisting track is as much fun as fun as piloting a GT3 racer around Monza, possibly more so.\n\nTo get the most out of this title, you will need a wheel but the game supports other inputs and is easily playable using a 360 controller. I use a battle worn and rather creaky logitech G25 and the default force feedback settings work really well, with only some minor adjustment made to the gain. You can of course make many adjustments to your chosen method of control, but I was happy with the out of the box settings.\n\nCars are a joy to drive. I always feel in control and that I can correct any minor mistakes without the rear swapping ends, but I know if I push too hard I'll be barrier bound. AC never let's you feel complacent, it just challenges you to drive as fast as you think you can and lets you feel fantastic when you hook up that record lap.\n\nThe recently introduced AI is decent but not perfect, especially in large fields. Every update brings improvements and thankfully the days of backflipping BMWs and pirouetting Paganis are thankfully now gone. Small fields of cars with similar performance on appropriate tracks will bring the greatest challenge, with more believable behaviour from your computer opponents. Those wanting multiplayer will have to wait a bit longer for that update though.\n\nIf you wish for a grown up racer then Assetto Corsa may just be for you, but remember that it's effectively a work in progress and many features are not available at this point. But what there is is at the time of this review is a great indication of what is to come when Assetto Corsa goes final.","February 18, 2014","true","327.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Well, it is almost there at least. I have wanted to get into sim racers for some time and when I saw this on the Steam Store I brought it. The selection of cars in the game is a good as there are several types of vehicles to choose from, these include open wheel, street and track cars. There is a small selection of tracks with some tracks just be variations but each track suits different cars.\nYou can play this game with a Xbox 360 controller but to get that immersive feeling like you are in the car and driving it you would have to invest in a wheel and pedals.\nThe graphics are actually very good, they could do with a polish but they are great for now.\nA few little tweaks with the car sounds can make it feel a bit more realistic.\nAs for the current state of the game it is absolutly brilliant.

Yes sir!\n\n\n------------\nUpdate May 2015. Assetto Corsa is now past 1.0 release and it's still going strong; Career option has been added, giving it a good single player experience, although I still miss the "garage" of GT5 where miles are tracked and cars need maintenance (even minimal is fine) for top performance.\n\nFurther more the Nurburgring is now completely inside the game, 20+km of glorious roads, although this update (and some nice extra cars) costs extra (DLC), worth the money? if you're invested in the game: sure; A must buy to enjoy AC? Not really.\n\nVR integration hasn't changed since release, still the same menu troubles and absent UI elements; a few hotkeys can be mapped to restart race, reset car. and since latest patch you need to tweak .ini files to get exposure working correctly (otherwise it's too bright); with DK2 using SweetFX to increase sharpness does a lot to get better immersion.

The visuals are just stunning, the physics are spot-on, the controller support is just fantastic... I sometimes have to remind myself it's just a game. Singleplayer is very open for mods, so there's no chance it'll ever get boring (Reliant Robin on a Mario Kart track, etc..) Multiplayer is great, but you'll need quick reflexes to avoid aggressive or inexperienced drivers, as they're pretty common. This game is not as much for people who like casual driving games, and I highly doubt this game would be playable without a proper racing wheel. So if you love hardcore simulation, this is your game. My only realy gripes are the often-lackluster AI (losing control in drag races, getting stuck on walls) and shaky connections online, but those are just minor. tl;dr great driving game, very realistic.","January 22","true","192.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I'm rather aggressive driver and i often end up doing a lot of corrections in corners, so i prefer having most of my grip to the rear wheels with very precise front, however it is important to note it takes a lot of time adjusting the handling the way you like, especially if you're new into cars terminology.\n\nUnlike other driving games in Assetto Corsa every car has its own personality and unique way of handling. Funny thing is that there is Formula 1 cars as well, and they feel more realistic than the actual Formula 1 game.\n\nYou have wide choise of cars and if you can't find your favorite brand or model, you can always download a mod of it. Assetto Corsa is not only about customizing your car handling, but customizing your entrie game experience the way you like.\n\nThe physhics give you the feel of driving a real car - every little detail of it.\n\nBut wait, theres more! You have many various gamemodes such as career mode, racing, hotlapping, drifting or just practice. And the best of all it comes with greatly synchronized multiplayer.\n\nTL;DR: The best racing simulator for PC so far.","June 29, 2014","true","146.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Problem is car handling feels dull and boring. So i assume this is the best car game i played so far.\n\nSome other stuff: there are not many tracks and garage could be a little bigger, but current amount of cars is enough. You can install track or car mods though. Devs also update the game with new cars and tracks(for free and as DLC)\n\nThere are lot's of settings for a car or game itself. I'm sure you can configure it as you want.\n\nGraphics ain't something special, but it gets the job done. There are also ways to configure post process filters so you can make colors brighter, add some contrast, saturation, etc. I did that and game looks like an eyecandy for me.\n\nMultiplayer lacks custom lobby host -> you always gotta find a server to play with your friend.\n\nWell... What can i say? A good racing game that pretends to be simulator. I never played sim racing games so i can't tell you if it's realistic enough or not, but it's definetely more challanging than Grid, Crew, TDU, any NFS game.\nSo as long as Project Cars never coming out and being delayed every month... Better get this game, because you can actually get it and play.","March 18, 2015","true","36.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","8"

The physics are difficult but once you get over the learning curve it's very rewarding. The graphics are outstanding, as is the sound. But that's all this game has going for it.\n\nThe career mode could not be more dull. It's a very simple, linear game. And since there are hardly any cars or tracks it gets repetitive. There is nothing to work for. No currency to buy cars, no "tournaments" that you can only enter by meeting certain qualifications, no licences. I'm not even sure why they call it a career mode. The experience of being a carrer racing driver is not there.\n\nComing from console gaming, and in particular playing the Gran Turismo series, this game is a huge letdown. I am hoping somebody comes out with a decent sim eventually because there's not much to offer on PC right now.","May 3, 2015","false","5.8"," 25 of 47 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","25","47","3","4"

So I bought it and I am not disappointed at all. It's a brilliant game especially concidering the fact it's in BETA mode. There are only a few cars available and there are also only a few tracks, but it's still good fun.\n\nTo play it I have a Thrustmaster Ferrari Edition Racing wheel which is not listed in the pre-configurations, but that's okay! You can easily configure the controls easily. It took me about 1 minute to set it up correctly. I did have to invert the throttle and brakes because they were the wrong way around but that's also fine.\n\nThe gearbox is impossible to change to manual. I want manual and you cannot change it; although you are allowed to interfere with the gearbox in-game and change up/down at will, but if the game detects it's too early then it changes back to what it thinks it should be. Hopefully this will be fixed at some point...\n\nAnother problem I have found when using my racing wheel is that the steering is really poor. I turn about 2 degrees and the wheels lock up and I jjust spear straight off. This is with all of the cars I use and it's really annoying because it's ruining the game for me. I have tried adjusting the sensetivity of the steering but so far, no luck... If anyone can help me with this then that's great, I'll test it out and let you know. Otherwise I would like to see it fixed.\n\nThe game for me is set of maximum settings and it runs perfectly... Very well optimised. This is my setup and it works great on maximum everything.\n\nCPU: Intel Core i5 3570K\nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680\nRAM: 8GB Corsair\netc.\n\nThe game overall is extremely good and I can't wait for the finished product! Despite the fact it's in BETA mode and it will have regular updates I fully 100% recommend this game to everyone! It's brilliant and in the short time that I have played I haven't found any bugs whilst in the game... Just a few setup issues as mentioned before.\n\nIf you're looking at my recorded play time and thinking "why should I listen, you've barely played it!"; well, if I'm writing a review without having even played an hour and I'm extremely impressed with it then you can imagine that I'll be playing a lot more in my spare time!\n\nEDIT: Since the review I have found how to adjust the gearbox to manual! It was right in front of me all the time in the realism settings! I have also adjusted the steering sensetivity and deadzones etc. for ages and it's still awful. And no, I'm not trying to enter a corner at 500 MPH. I'm doing it at a range between 60 MPH (100 KPH) down to ~37 MPH (60 KPH) and at both speeds, it's awful!","March 9, 2014","true","12.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The sounds are great, the driving dynamics are great as well, and the customizable UI is revolutionary, becuase you can have it set to exactly how you want it. The only thing I can think of that it needs is so more street cars instead of having it be all race cars, and the skid force on force feedback could also be worked on.

The feeling of the sim is pretty much right on point (using G27 wheel) being smooth and not overdriving is key or you'll end up scrubbing speed and losing time, once you get the feeling and get accustomed you'll start to see the rewards this sim will give you for respecting it. This is no arcade type sim, so don't buy this if you plan on driving it like you would on forza or need for speed.  Can't wait to see what they come up with once it's fully released with online, this will give iRacing a run for its money especially when Nurburgring Nordschleife is on this service.","February 26, 2014","true","9.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Gameplay-enhancing mods are also available if you prefer having some different changes to your game.\n\nIf you're looking for a great simulation racer and other games just aren't doing the trick, then look no futher than Assetto Corsa.

I've only done the car retextures and gotten tracks that other modders have made. This helps to make this among the best racing games out there in my opinion. Especially since there are a lot of modders out there trying to make content for this game.\n\n-- Steering wheel controller --\nWorks mostly with the Logitech G27 steering wheel, but the steering wheel's shift indicator doesn't work... (( Look below for solution to this )) It's okay, though kind of takes away from the feel of the game for me. The game with this steering wheel will shift in such a way that allows you to use the manual shifter (H-pattern) when in a car that has an H-pattern shifter, otherwise you're restricted to the paddle shifters for those cars that have that. I prefer the H-Pattern shifter, but there many cars in the game that don't use that shifter.\n\n-- Other issues --\nCurrently no career mode, and when its added hopefully it won't force people to drive all manner of cars...\n\nCurrently some cars are very twitchy if you accelerate oddly quick. This is mostly something from the high horsepower cars.\n\n-- Solutions to problems above --\n* Steering wheel issue with G27 and no LEDs use. Download FanaLEDs program, In FanaLEDs program do File - Open Settings, open Global, change revledtype to 1, then save, close FanaLEDs and reopen it. Now you can set up the RPM percentage you want to start counting at, for me this is 60%. And it will count up each LED on the steering wheel until about 500 RPMs before red line and at red line it will start flashing the LEDs to indicate that you need to shift up. I love Assetto Corsa now that this feature works, maybe they will make it so we don't need to use FanaLEDs to get this to work in the future.\n\n*** UPDATE as of Release Candidate 1.0.1 ***\nThe game's cars don't act like the real world cars anymore. In particular, the production car ones. They feel too twitchy and act more like what you'd expect on an arcade game instead of being something like you'd get on a driving simulator game like GT5. Hopefully, they'll fix this for the actual release.","September 29, 2014","true","89.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

I don't have a steering wheel and pedal set. I play Assetto Corsa with a PS3 gamepad.\n\nThe game is early access and is, right now, a very good time trial simulator. The way I played it, being new to racing sims, was to pick a car and a track, and play the hell out of it (I picked the E92 M3 and Silverstone GP). I also tried the other cars a bit but my main focus was this car/track combo.\n\nIf you are also new to racing sims, this is the right way to play, because you want to find out quickly if you can't enjoy racing sims.

To me, F1 2012 actually doesn't seem that bad compared to Forza; it seems like the cars act like they do on TV.

I'll really know when Project Cars goes live but damn, you can tweak EVERYTHING on these cars!  And the cars.....!  Excuse me, had to wipe the drool off my chin.  Did mention the cars?  And they continue to add more.  The tracks and beautiful.  But beware, arcade is a dirty word around Kunos.  This game is gorgeous and the teaser trailer does not due it justice, it is even more graphically beautiful then any other game I have ever owned.  This game is demanding, it demands your respect, it demands your TIME (  you have to invest a considerable amount of time in this, tweaking, tweaking and then you must tweak )  The publishers set out to make the ultimate driving and racing sim and they  suceeded, boy did they suceed.\n\nThere are many, many pros for this game, maybe too many to mention but a few are:\n\na)  The beauty of the game\nb)  The close attention to details in both cars and tracks.  The weather options work as weather works IRL.  The sky acts like the sky IRL.  The cars act as they are supposed to but I really can't stand behind that statement because in all of my 65 years I have never driven any of these vehicles, lol but I trust Kunos on that.\nc)  Blah, blahba blab blah blab\n\nThe only con I can mention is this:\n\nThis game is an accurate simulation of racing.  If you don't know what your doing (like for instance...me) it does not hold your hand.  Learn or never successfully race again.  When driving the powerful cars ( and AC lets you drive them all) you rarely recover from the condition known as Leadeus Footites.  You won't advance very far in the career mode if you do not put in the time to learn the intricaces of the game.  This game is tough with a capital What The Hell Did I Do Wrong This Time?, T. The AC community are very friendly and helpful, that is until you race them.  Those that know what they are doing will K I l l you everytime.  As I mentioned earlier, you have to invest your time, you have no choice if you want to fully enjoy this game.  Fortunately,  I got this on sale (which made my friend in the British Isles, Skymarshall_uk very irked) but I don't regret a dime I have invested in it.\n\nAll in all I rate game on  a couple of levels:    Beauty and Asthetics:  I can only go to 10 so I give it 11+\nDifficulty:  Again, I can on go to 10 but it's much harder than that\nPlayability and Replayability:  10, if you invest the time\nController Accessibilty:  Supports all wheels that I can see\nFinal rating:  10  I recomend this to ALL gearheads and wannabees (like me)\n\nThanx for reading and hopefully this helps you in your selection.  The Managment.\n\nOh, and by the way, you had better have some heft in your video graphics card and speed in your CPU.

There is a fair amount of skill transfer to the Formula Abarth in Assetto Corsa, and F1 2012's video run-through's of tracks also help.","February 4, 2014","true","42.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

(GT 730 with a 2.40GHz CPU, 32-bit [ie 3.4gb max of ram, not everybody has a good computer...])\n\nCons:-Dead multiplayer. [i say we bring it back to life with an open world map]\n-AI that leavs much to be desired (EX: pass in front of a car. it hits the brakes full-on, not always though),\n-May get boring quick you if you just do hotlaps. don't do that, okay?\n-Sounds on some of the stock cars sound par. except maybe the 2015 Ford Mustang, which sounds pretty good\n-$45 price tag as of writing this review, (in US currency.)\n-Career that could be improved.\n-All these negative reviews. that's right; this is a con.\n\nNotes:-DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITH A KEYBOARD! it's terrible. don't.\n-I recommend using a steering wheel. (that is NOT a Thrusmaster T80, because it sucks bad!) you will not regret it,\n\n\nRecommended Mods, in no order:(i recommend Assetto Corsa DB[assetto-db.com] for the vast majority of these mods)\nGinetta G55\n\nMazda 787B (prepare for eargasms like no tommorow)\n\nRedbull X2010 (THIS THING IS VEEERRRYYY BRUTAL, you need to be on your f***ing toes when driving this thing, NO JOKE!)\n\nFerrari 288XX/512-TR\n\nCorvette Stingray ZR-1\n\nMazda Miata N/A (older model, not the official version, i like this version more)\n\nFerrari F1 Concept (not for casual gamers; this thing is for the true-blooded enthusiasts!!)\n\nBuick GNX\n\nWilly's Jeep (yes, this is an actual mod,)\n\nOrion Vii(6) Bus (the drift variant has a top speed of 170mph, no f***ing joke!\n\nVolvo/Mercedes Formula Truck\n\nGumpert Apollo S (used to be a paymod, thank god it isn't now.)\n\nCorvette C6R (fantastic. utterly fantastic.)\n\nLake Louise (sadly, it has 2 varients: 23km and 50km, for the 50km track [aka full track] you have to pay money to download, i say f*** that!)\n\nFuji Speedway (pretty good testing track)\n\nToyota Supra Time Attack now there is an official verison. might not be a need for this now.\n\nShuto Expressway C1 (HAS WORKING TUNNELS THAT ACTUALLY ECHO SOUNDS, YO!)\nfeel free to recommend some more.\n\n[side note: i have a review for rFactor 2 as well, so if you want to see that, go ahead.]","April 14","true","369.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The physics are also spot on as well, but to me, force feedback is in a way more important than physics. Force feedback is the way we connect with the sim, it's how we drive. What good would the physics be without the FFB to back it up??? That's exactly where iracing gets it wrong, great physics but bad FFB. pCars and GT6 have it the other way around, good FFB but not the best physics.\n\nAssetto Corsa nails them both (physics and FFB) while also having great graphics for a PC sim and a better group of base content than any other sim that isn't also on console\n\nIf you love sim racing, there's no way you can live on without buying this.

So great that you just want to keep turning the volume up on your speakers until they hit 11! I really like the work they've done with it.

Amazing physics, tracks, graphics, playability (playing with an x1 controller), simply outclasses every other wannabe-sim, GJ guys, I would gladly pay the double for such a gem !\n\nI cant even describe how I feel about the game. You cant "feel" it from the screenshots or the videos. You have to play it by yourself to understand what rarity this game is. If you are into racing and like simulations, this is the best one to get, there's no doubt about it.\n\nWhat I love most about the game is to drive competitive on RSR, which is a mod for this game and is just ideal for hotlaping. The car handling is very rewarding and there is a thin line between ideal breaking and pushing and locking your brakes or slowing down too early and loosing a TON of time. I actually never played a more rewarding game then this one, the Delta function lets you know how fast you currently are compared to your best time and there is always room for improvement. To really master a corner (yea, believe me there's much more to it to be able to say that you've mastered a course :D ) it takes a lot of practice and every car acts differently.\n\nThat's the other thing, the cars. Believe me, THIS game doesn't need 100+ cars. Every car feels different and you can really tell the difference between an F40 and any other car (of course with all the assists off). Some of the memorable experiences driving the cars in this game definitely include the F40, 458 GT2, Lotus 98T, La Ferrari, Mercedes SLS AMG, Pagani Huayra, KTM Xbow R and many more.\n\nThe tracks, they are laser-scanned, what else is there to say? There's not much you could do any better, since they are like 1:1 copies to real life. Bumps and every uneven part, its there ... If you add the superb physics of this game (track conditions, tyres, tyre wear and temperature) you get the closest 1:1 experience currently available.\n\nMany moan about the graphics. I'm not much into this discussion because I still think that this game has way better graphics then pCars (in pCarsthe cars are just too shiny and the model is made brighter on purpose just to be "shiny", just have a close look in comparisons).\n\nMy favorite comparison, you'd be the judge, just look at the corner drive through at 1mins03secs and watch the lightning and reflections:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRMlL4fR180#t=65\n\nAfter 1.0.0 a lot changed and its really an eyecandy now, ofc. with the correct filter and on full graphics. I play it in 2K with DSR on and I can tell you I could do screenshots of this game till I'd run out of HDD space ...\n\nI'm giving this game 10/10 cause its the best in its class (simulation) and I haven't found another game which would give me such a feeling from driving a car. I'm simply amazed :)","December 25, 2013","true","885.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I had serious doubts about the physics. Having recently tried Raceroom Racing Experience (and seriously disliked the physics), I had little faith in Assetto Corsa, but decided to try it anyways due to the good reviews. All I can say is WOW. The physics are nearly spot on! I have played Live for Speed for a long time, and have revered it as the best game in term of physics. This game is a close second for me currently, and before long, it will probably overtake LFS in terms of physics. In the graphics department, it has already surpassed, as well as in the car selection. The little details make me happy as well, such as changing gear ratios. Instead of being able to pick any number for the ratio, you can only use realistic ratios that would exist on a real car. Pretty neat. Definately worth the money I paid, especially when we will have content releases up until 2018!","January 18, 2014","true","13.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

But the game is yet to feel finished, they realised the first DLC recently, and I was thinking to myself, "what? That's absurd! You can't release DLC for an Early Access game!" So I went to the store page and found that the game wasn't in Early Access anymore.\n\nAnd this is the meat of my issues with this game, it's contentless. There's a miniscule number of cars, and a tiny number of tracks, and this would be ok, if the game was $30 dollars, but it's $50, almost full price, yet, there isn't enough to warrant the price.\n\nI feel jipped when I play this game, yeah, there are mods, but when a game's best feature is something someone else has done, then there is a problem.\n\nThis asking price is also annoying for those of us (like myself) who have a limited budget, when I first purchased this game for $30 dollars, I felt a little ripped off, but I thought to myself, "don't worry, they'll add more content." Yet they haven't, and I still feel like I've been had. Despite me paying almost half then the current asking price, I still don't feel like I've got a good deal. If I'd purchased this game for $50, I'd probably be ripping my hair out currently.\n\nYes, this game has a lot of good points, but due to the fact that there is a laughably low amount of content in this game, I simply can't recommend this game to anyone who has respect for their money. If you have money coming out of your eye balls, then go ahead, buy it, enjoy a very good simulation of driving, but if you don't, then move on, because this is simply a waste.\n","March 21, 2015","false","17.2"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","0"

Okay the career is a bit boring, but online racing is good. The cars really handle very differently to each other and the laser scanned Nurburging Nordschleife is an absolute joy to drive.\n\nThen a couple of times a year a patch comes along +/- DLC.

Looking for something similar, but that you can play on PC? Hoping to use an Xbox 360 controller or something similar because you don't have $300-$1000 of disposable income to buy on a racing wheel? Look elsewhere.\n\nI bought this because I have played all kinds of racing games over the years, but hadn't really found a good PC racing game. This looked like the answer, but after a little over a half an hour of skidding into walls while trying frantically to saw at the wheel in a vain attempt to regain control of my vehicle, I realized that this is not the game for me.\n\nRealistically, in the "Requirements" section, a racing wheel should be listed. If you're going to say that you support the Xbox 360 controller, then I shouldn't have to futz with the settings just to finally get it to a point where the most minute of movements doesn't have the driver spinning the wheel frantically from side to side. Honestly, this problem has been SOLVED. Turn 10 obviously is aiming almost exclusively for the 360 controller, but these developers basically just shoved in some nonsensical presets and called it a day. It appears to respond as it would to the analog input of a wheel, which is ridiculous. A wheel has wildly different affordances than a 360 controller, yet the default presets make the game unplayable with said controller.\n\nNot to mention the fact that the game crashed multiple times on me in various settings menus. I'm very disappointed with Assetto Corsa. As a racing fan, I was hoping that this would be the answer for my craving for a solid racing game to replace Forza. What I received was a buggy game that only appears to be enjoyable if you've got a racing wheel. Which is fine, but I wish I had known that *before* I dropped $60 on the game.

I've played every single Simbin game, Live for Speed, rFactor, NFS Shift 1+2, Project Cars beta, etc. As much as I'm hype for the release of Project Cars, Assetto Corsa is far better from my own experience. I have a Logitech G27 setup which I use for every game, and I have to say the realism in Assetto Corsa feels ridiculously nice. It's the closest thing I've felt to real life in any video game. Temperature and tarmac conditions affect the handling of the vehicle, it's not too forgiving if you horribly miss-shift a gear or improperly rev match, the sunlight can mess you up real good, tires wear pretty realistically in the sense that if you use a non-abs car and slam on the brakes, one section of your tires will flatten out and you will feel that in the wheel as youre driving, which will also affect your handling. The only thing this game can use that PCars has, is the collision physics. They're way too forgiving and not so damaging to the vehicles, and it'd be nice to have some good menu music. I HIGHLY recommend this game, and I cannot wait to see what else they're going to release for it. Between PCars and ACorsa, I feel Corsa is the better game, but lets find out when theyre both in their final stages!","December 25, 2014","true","27.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dmstewart/recommended/244210/","dmstewart","DMStewart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dmstewart/","267 products in account","I must preface this fast review with my history of driving sims. Since it first launched, Gran Tourismo was my game of choice. I purchased a Playstation 2 and 3 just for Gran Tourismo. And it was the only game I owned for my PS2. For my PS3 I did own a few other games but dont remember what they were. I have yet to find a driving sim that even came close to GT.\n\nBut thats changed. I have been watching AC for a long time; from a distance and waiting for it to go on sale. Travelling caused me to miss two previous sales. I finally pulled the trigger and just spent the past hour practicing. Its immediately apparent that it is definitely in the same class as GT. And my first impressions is that it may possibly be better than GT. How so?\n\n*One of the reasons is load times. They are dramatically shorter than GT. Now, I know that this is PC and the load times should be shorter. But the load times for GT were always so ridiculously long that it was sometimes very annoying to deal with, especially if you intend to just play a quick race or two. But AC load times are fast, so far. I have only played practice races/laps so I cant speak on "career" load times. But Im imagining that they should be the same.\n\n*GT set the bar for creating driving sims where the cars actually handle to spec. That was amazing for Playstation but in the PC world an accurate sim shouldnt be too hard to achieve. What is hard to achieve, and is a minor failure for GT, is precise vehicle tech tinkering that implements an easy to use UI that remains simple and intuitive. It was awesome that you can tweak just about everything on a car in GT and actually feel the difference in performance. What wasnt awesome was actually using that interface. AC's interface is intuitive and as simple to use as can possibly be expected. It doesnt take forever to tweak your settings...unless you are just being indecisive. But you can get in and out of spec adjustments in the pre-race menu fast and start your race.\n\n*Actual car control: This is important and its always the small details that devs get wrong that irk me. GT actually gets almost all of the little details right. But so does AC. As someone who has owned a few - but driven a wide variety - of high performance cars, its certain little details that, when missed, really ruin the experience for me. In AC take the 458 Italia out and switch the camera to the third-person overview. When the car shifts it snaps forward and almost looks like a glitch. But thats what the car does in real life shifting into 2nd, 3rd, and sometimes 4th depending on traction control settings selected by the driver. And its important that that detail is there and is figured into the car's in-game performance. For example, a hammerhead or hairpin can be expertly navigated if the driver uses that powerband snap correctly. The game lets you do this. Its hard, but you can do it. Expert Ferarri drivers (and some 458 owners) can also do this on the track. But that is something that couldve easily been missed or left-out and not many wouldve been the wiser. This shows me that the attention to detail was properly prioritized. Compare that to GT who seems to put increasing focus on the real-world/outside world graphics for great looking replays. Thats fine. But I dont need that in a sim. If the edges are too sharp on a certain building I can care less. I'll be mad if I execute a perfect tight S-turn with a 458, look for that upshift snap, and dont get it.\n\n*Graphics: I would love to compare these to GT once I eventually get all of my settings set properly. There seem to be quite a few options and I really need to tweak and test everything to get it just right. But I prefer the ability to tweak. Dont get me wrong, GT looks beautiful and since its on console its "finished" and off limits. And it probalby doesnt need any adjustments. So I will update this small bulletpoint later when I can really play around with the graphics. But so far, right out of the box, it looks pretty darn good.\n\n*Online races/Competing against friends: Will return to add to this bulletpoint. But as a driving sim online battles have never been a major concern for me. This is due to the fact that there are too many factors involved when trying to organize a real-world sim race. That is why arcade style racers tend to handle this cattegory a little better and this a topic that I could write a book on, so let me stop now and just promise to update this part later.\n\n*Overall vehicle handling and responsiveness: I have only driven 3 cars so far in practive mode and each one has just been fantastic. As a driving sim fanatic I am utterly surprised at how well each car was representing its real-life counterpart. If I start a race and I can basically just peg the accelerator and win, well, its garbage. If I just have to brake a couple times and throw the steering wheel fully from side to side to win, its garbage. If I fire it up for the first time and slide off the track, rack up penalties, and basically "lose", then we have a sim with potential. My first run was with the RUF Yellowbird. And it was the shortest run Ive ever had. Not because I killed it but because the game killed me. I stopped, said to myself "this is no joke" and hopped into an Elise and started looking at all the settings and car specs so that I could approach this like a real-worl race. And that is why everyone who wants a good racing sim should buy this immediately.\n\nRating: Spin-out/10 (Hey, even the best sim drivers need practice)\n\nEDIT: I just realized that the replays have the ability to add all sorts of apps on the screen. (Pedal activity, Speedo/Gear box, and literally tons more). While its a cool feature to look at, its also absolutely brilliant for finding the areas of a track where you can trim time away. After losing a few times of the same race I was able to go back into the replay and see the exact points where I could accelerate a split second sooner, brake a split second later, and even downshift in an area where I didnt think I could benefit from doing so. Im so pumped about this.","December 27, 2014","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

If the team in Italy made a steering wheel and full chasis and wrap around screens, I would be saving for a while, but I would trust they would deliver as they are doing with this game.\n\nIf you want quick thrills, feel like your a racing god without effort, haven't driven a real car yet, I suggest you do not let yourself down and go else where.\n\nWhat gets many purring like an engine is in the detail, you may not see it, but believe me it's there.

It's a team of passionate people, who love cars, love racing, and they have a vision and dare to share. They already have some famous and well respected car makers on board, and more are coming.

It has blown me away so far. I first played with a controller (xbox 360) and I have to say it's quite playable and lots of fun. But, truth be told, getting a decent wheel (Logitech Driving Force GT) has improved the driving experience immensely. I've never played a game that gets so close to what driving a car feels like. The physics are superb. The sense of weight and speed, the feeling of the tires, the way the car reacts when you push the throttle too much, etc...\n\nThis sim is a delight. I've never really  tried proper racing simulators, the closest thing being Forza on Xbox, a great game on its own right but I can tell you now that it's certainly not a sim. Let's not talk about Gran Turismo either...\n\nThe graphics look beautiful, the sound (not being the strongest point) is getting better and better, and the modding potential of this title makes it a must-have for racing fans. It's not 100% finished and the selection of cars, tracks and game modes are meager compared to what Gran Turismo or Forza have to offer but I expect it to grow a very strong community in years to come. It also helps that, unlike on those titles, EACH car behaves quite differently.\n\nStrongly recommended for racing fans.","July 21, 2014","true","182.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

YES !!!\n\nMy experience with racinggames: I started with NFS in 1995, play with a wheel since NFS HP 1998 and like both arcade and\nsimulation. My most enjoyed game is DTM3 as it offered the best competitive online challange to me.\n\nAt this moment the game is still in Early Access and does not include a multiplayersection yet. It however does offer quite a number of well detailed cars and laserprecise tracks. I'm looking forward to what is coming as the game keeps bonding me even when it is only singleplayer at this moment.\n\n\nAssetto Corsa, the good things:\n- There is a well detailed custom controller setup\n- You can tweak your car as expected when getting a racingsimulator\n- The carhandling is very good. Only Richard Burns Rally offered me a better experience.\n- You can tweak your videodetails as desired between various steps. The game even runs smooth on my tablet on medium/high quality, without AI. My tablet's CPU and GPU are below the minimum specs as described in the steamstore.\n- You can turn on/off and position heads up display as you want (and probably add more by installing mods)\n- The game is mod friendly, user created cars and tracks to be expected.\n- The game offers extreme detailed functioning HUD's.\n- The game is a good simulator. For people loving arcade games, the assist functions have the potential to make it a great game aswell, but these functions still need working on.\n\nAssetto Corsa, the bad things (alphaa fase):\n- There is a number of 'holes' in some tracks which penalise you by wrecking your car.\n- New in this alphaa stage are AI cars, but they tend to use 100% of the CPU on a full grid... (I have 24 cores)\n- There is no damage model (yet).\n- Damage does not influence carbehavior (yet).\n- Assist functions for both wheel and keyboard/gamepad don't allow you to drift when desired, also having difficulties with launching cars and the brakinglines are incorrect.\n- All cars best launch is full throttle in this game, like you don't lose grip... even with launchcontrol turned off.\n- Some achievements are too easy, some too difficult. Time Attack, start extreme slow means gold achievement, dragracing full throttle launch is win all, drifting goldcoins are doable, but you need to go sideways all the way instead of driving the tracks which is kind of pointless and you can't achieve it by just driving and drifting in the corners, you need to drift on the straights.\n\nI give the game for it's current state a 7/10. A multiplayersection, extra content, damagemodels, fixed assist functions and fixed bugs can seartenly raise that number.","March 9, 2014","true","34.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are awesome, the physics of the cars are great, and the tracks are sweet. You really get a feel for the car and the track. They used this same technology in Victory: the age of racing. I play that as well now. Our group simply can not wait for this game to go over the wire. It's going to be awesome and I'm very happy to be part of the process. I would like to see "more" F1, legend, and classic cars in the game. They have a lot of sweet cars, but I'm really hooked on the whole Formula gig. This thing is on sale now, I'm considering buying it for a few friends due to the reduction, but I would pay full price for the game again. This game is really nice, coming from a guy who's purchased a lot of racing games and been very disappointed until now.","March 7, 2014","true","16.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With that being said, I am both completely in love with it, and disgusted by it at the same time. Why?\nWhen you get the game running the way it should (for a little while at least) It's freaking amazing. I own practically every racing game there is to date, and the handling, physics, and graphics are awe inspiring. Coming from iRacing, it feels far more real. You don't just lose traction randomly. It feels very realistic. You can counter steer, downshift, or drift to recover from a little too much meat in the sandwich coming to a turn, which is awesome, and it feels like it should. I drove patrol cars at high speeds for many years, and I can tell you the induced skid feels genuine. The recovery, depending on the particular car is there too. Bottom line, amazing, outstanding game, and when it gets close to release I am sure it will put a lot of other titles to bed.\n\nNow for why I hate it.\nI run an AMD 8 core 4.2ghz machine, with 16gb of ram, and 2 ATI HD7870's in Crossfire.. Logitech G27, triple Asus 1080p Monitors, and so on.. My system is pretty outstanding.\nWhen you load up to play, the video options are sort of useless. There are options you've never seen in any game before, that you won't understand. I still don't. The most common options aren't there. What the problem is, in case you have it, is HDR.\nApparently, with the AMD drivers that are currently available, (Including the new Beta drivers I got last night) They simply can't use the in-game HDR. What happens? This absolutely disgusting flickering, not only accross the entire screen, but also on all shaded objects. It took me forever to figure out that it was the HDR doing it.\nTurning off HDR and turning the faces thing to an even number fixed it for me, but I feel like I am missing a lot by not being able to use those options. With 2 $500 video cards, you'd think you'd be able to beef everything up.. Not in this case.\nI'm sure they'll fix it eventually, so don't let that issue stop you from picking it up. The gameplay is fantastic, and well worth the money if you are a sim racer.\nAlso, the selection of cars currently available is pretty outstanding as well. Keep in mind, this is a euro based game, though they will offer us a C7 Corvette soon, which is pretty awesome.\n\nI give the game a 9 out of 10, and it's not a 10 solely for the reason that it is still in development, and has a lot of bugs. It crashes often for me, sometimes completely locking my system up, but again, I get it. It's in development. It's the price you pay for getting in early. I've done a ton of alpha and beta testing since 1999, so I am used to it, but for someone that is freaked out by that stuff, or gets angry easily, maybe you should wait until the full release.\nWhether you choose to get it today, or down the road when it's complete, get it. It's awesome. Even with it's bugs, having to reset my PC 12x a day, I still play it, and I still enjoy the hell out of it. It's awesome. Get it.","March 7, 2014","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

YES !!!\n\nMy experience with racinggames: I started with NFS in 1995, play with a wheel since NFS HP 1998 and like both arcade and\nsimulation. My most enjoyed game is DTM3 as it offered the best competitive online challange to me.\n\nAt this moment the game is still in Early Access and does not include a multiplayersection yet. It however does offer quite a number of well detailed cars and laserprecise tracks. I'm looking forward to what is coming as the game keeps bonding me even when it is only singleplayer at this moment.\n\n\nAssetto Corsa, the good things:\n- There is a well detailed custom controller setup\n- You can tweak your car as expected when getting a racingsimulator\n- The carhandling is very good. Only Richard Burns Rally offered me a better experience.\n- You can tweak your videodetails as desired between various steps. The game even runs smooth on my tablet on medium/high quality, without AI. My tablet's CPU and GPU are below the minimum specs as described in the steamstore.\n- You can turn on/off and position heads up display as you want (and probably add more by installing mods)\n- The game is mod friendly, user created cars and tracks to be expected.\n- The game offers extreme detailed functioning HUD's.\n- The game is a good simulator. For people loving arcade games, the assist functions have the potential to make it a great game aswell, but these functions still need working on.\n\nAssetto Corsa, the bad things (alphaa fase):\n- There is a number of 'holes' in some tracks which penalise you by wrecking your car.\n- New in this alphaa stage are AI cars, but they tend to use 100% of the CPU on a full grid... (I have 24 cores)\n- There is no damage model (yet).\n- Damage does not influence carbehavior (yet).\n- Assist functions for both wheel and keyboard/gamepad don't allow you to drift when desired, also having difficulties with launching cars and the brakinglines are incorrect.\n- All cars best launch is full throttle in this game, like you don't lose grip... even with launchcontrol turned off.\n- Some achievements are too easy, some too difficult. Time Attack, start extreme slow means gold achievement, dragracing full throttle launch is win all, drifting goldcoins are doable, but you need to go sideways all the way instead of driving the tracks which is kind of pointless and you can't achieve it by just driving and drifting in the corners, you need to drift on the straights.\n\nI give the game for it's current state a 7/10. A multiplayersection, extra content, damagemodels, fixed assist functions and fixed bugs can seartenly raise that number.","March 9, 2014","true","34.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Playing the first 4 hours of the newly released career I was unable to put this game down.  I feel as if I have just driven 4 hours on a real track.  The steering feel and weight are perfect, the feeback through the wheel means you can push the cars to find the limit just as you would in real life.  There is no need to use the 'dotted racing line' on screen as you can feel the cars through the corners.  In the front wheel drive cars understeer is telegraphed and easy to feel as you reach the limit of grip.  More impressively oversteer in cars like the E90 M3 starts with a slight pull on the wheel in opposite to the direction of travel - an excellent simulation of the yaw effect which gives you plenty of warning to react and correct.\n\nA simulation as close to reality as I've experienced, the cars feel properly hooked up to the track.
