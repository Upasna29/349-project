Its a great game to play if you dont have much time on your hands just hop on and play a couple of matches.\n\nYou get to collect alot of different monsters to fight along side you. Each of the monsters has there own abilities and feel unique from one another.\n\nThe difficulty curve is very well done as every level you play gets harder but not too hard and it doesnt get too easy (unless if your some pro which i am no where near)\n\n(NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT PAY TO WIN)\n\nIn pvp every monster is boosted to level 10 so they all have generally the same stats all tho some monsters are better then others just based on there abilities. With that being said, it doesnt matter if your team is better then the other players yeah it will help you a little bit but skill is a huge factor in pvp because if you're faster you'll charge your abilities faster and probably win.\n\nEach ability is a little mini game in its self which is pretty fun.Sling shot bombs into targets, Quick time events and alot more.\n\nOverall for a free game its very good. You dont need to pay and skill wins in the end.\n\nIf you got some free time i suggest you check it out.\n\nEnjoy :)","May 26","true","3.0"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

The graphics are nice, the art style is nice and the gameplay just works really well its a really good game and for free its even better\n\nI would also like the see some Australian/New Zealand servers as i was only getting games with the asian server this had very little impact on the game though even at more than 200 ping","May 26","true","1.6"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

Some 'Mystic' drops are also marketable.\n\nCons:\n- Needs Proper tutorial, spell and minion descriptions, as I spent many matches not knowing what some abilities did and how they charged.\n- Sometimes some animations prevent you from your already begun turns, forcing you to repeat them.\n- The story mode seems repeatable and needs more creativity.\n\nFinal score: 8/10.\nAlready Fun game with more potential.","June 5","true","24.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The biggest and most important difference between ember strike and other games of this genre are that between you and your opponent there are no turns, you each have to swap and attack as fast as you can.\n\nFast gameplay is neat, but couple it with full single player and you get a well rounded single/multi -player experience that many are sure to enjoy. that being said such broad appeal is hard to recommend to a single type of player. so if you think you might enjoy it, give it a try, it seems to be a really high quality free to play game for now. hope it only gets better from here on.","June 3","true","1.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Its challenging and I like that the attacks aren't automatic hits/crits like in a game such as pokemon, you actually have to have accuracy if you want to advance and/or gain new friends to fight on your side.  It looks like there is a lot of people to unlock and I plan on playing this game some more, so we will see how long this game takes to complete, but it is very catchy and easy to get into.  Even though there is pressure to find the 3 or 4 symbols to match up, I would say this is a more laidback, relaxing game and I highly recommend it to everyone.  10/10 and its free.

It's just like Gems of War which I loved. The only difference, which is quite big, is that you do not play in turns so you have to be faster than your opponent in order to win. The game is quite rewarding and I do hope they will add new heroes/abilities.

New minions are thrown to you regularly, until... they're not. After about the first 8 minions, I hit an absolute brick wall. The PvE doesnt give you nearly enough coins to level your minions (currently the enemies I'm facing are 15!!! team levels above me), and it takes 20 stages to earn enough embers to get a new minion.\n\nThe only way to progress at this point seems to be to boost through microtransactions, something I'm not willing to do.\n\nPvP is fun up to a point - they've balanced it reasonably well by having all minions be considered lvl 10 on both sides, however team comp plays a HUGE part, and with the aforementioned lack of minions without paying, you might be lucky to have 1 group of 5 that work together well out of your 8 or so minions.\n\nUnless you are willing to pull out your wallet, or mindlessly grind lower levels for weeks in order to get 1 new minion, or level enough to beat 1 extra stage, then stay clear of this title.","June 3","false","8.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

Playing the PvE is fun until you have to either A) Play PvP or B) Buy gems with money to level up your minions\n2.  Playing PvP is fun until you run into players that are cheating.

There are limited ways to earn embers, which aside from purchasing gems is the primary way of unlocking minions. After about level 6 on each minion and with maybe two unlocked, the difference between your minions and the NPCs or sometimes other player characters become apparent.\n\nYou have to grind matches either against the pc (that you've already won) at a greatly reduced gold intake, or do pvp matches against other players for a decent payout. If you lose either, you get nothing.\n\nThere are some bonus missions that can be done for extra embers, but they may not be ones you can complete - for example, do 10 moon attacks in winning pvp matches. I don't even have a moon minion, and withour earning embers (or spending real $$ on gems) who knows when I'll have one?\n\nI see this game as a huge time sink with little rewards, though it is fun enough on the surface.","June 4","false","3.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
