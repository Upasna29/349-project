The Count Lucanor is going to push you to be very patient and think for solutions to puzzles and wait for those pesky enemies to pass by so you can pass freely on your way to get rich or die trying. Or something. I don't know. You're ten in this game and you're a total snot-nosed brat. Whatever kids do to get rich in a medieval setting. I guess lemonade stands don't work in this.\n\nHans is an interesting protagonist, though. He's poor. He's mad. He wants something to change. He's upset his birthday feels like an ordinary day. I feel you, Hans. I feel you. So after he storms off, things become a relative acid trip. This is like a 70s filmed fairytale cartoon, only there's a lot more death. Think of this as Little Red Riding Hood paired with Alice in Wonderland and pepper that with some Hansel and Gretel. Then we throw in a dungeon crawler game with some classic horror hiding mechanics. It's an interesting thing to try and blend together, but it really works. Some of your enemies are terrifying and Lovecraftian. Some look like they're ripped out of a 90s anime. Others look like your standard dungeon crawling enemies. The thing is, you can't actually attack anyone. You're ten. All you can do is run and hide.\n\nThe hiding can get very irritating because the enemies are smart. They know about where you disappeared to and they will come after you. They will lurk in the area. If you disappeared behind a door, they will still be there. In a way, this is sort of an improvement upon old games that instantly reset enemies. If someone saw you go into a door, obviously they should be there waiting for you. Realistic, yeah. It's still hard to make a daring escape that way.\n\nThose same smart enemies also have a very nice range of pull so if you didn't get out of the way in the time you needed to, prepare your buns, hun. They will just pull you everywhere and it's um, not polite. Keep your tentacles to yourself. That's quite rude, you know. You didn't even buy me dinner. Speaking of, there's something about this game that does make me very happy. Every time you die, it's your fault. There's no overpowered character. There's nothing there that you can blame on the game. It's always your poor planning or your impatience that killed you. After dying multiple times in one area, I found there was another way around. Let's just place on my little hat that says "Shame on Me" and pretend I didn't have some death run that even some kind of famous youtuber would envy for some views. I learned my lesson.\n\nAnyway, much like all fairytales, this game is incredibly dark and topics of murder and torture are tossed around like a joke. If you don't think fairytales are dark, remember that parent figures regularly murder children in the santized versions. Okay? Okay. So. This is all some blood covered goodness. In fact, that's literal in many parts of the game. Sure, the blue kobold is adorable and Hans has these kawaii anime eyes, but this gets dark. Even the storyline gets pretty dark, though that doesn't really kick in until the last part of the game.\n\nVisually, The Count Lucanor is pleasing for pixels. There's still a lot that can be accomplished with pixels and told in pixels. This game is perfect for it. It's bright and completely tricks you into thinking this game is going to be happy while it mops the floor with a bucket of blood. You know, for the grotesque party we'll have later. Yeah. I can't really comment on the music because it's period appropriate classical music. An untrained ear wouldn't figure out what it is. If you're a mega nerd, you'll just be grinning like a lunatic while you keep playing and whispering music jokes. Please don't. I'm one of these nerds. You'll start groaning at your own jokes. I'm warning you ahead of time not to do that to yourself. Just keep playing and don't do that.\n\nIt's not incredibly high horror. The worst jumpscare I got was the loading screen when I had a little kobold staring at me and letting me know my game was loading. If I clicked on it now, he'd still scare me. He doesn't make a noise and it still makes me want to scream. He is not pleasant to look at. A certain Charlemengo is not my cup of tea, but it's more like he gives me the heebie jeebies rather than makes me jump out of my seat. There's nothing that's going to just jump into your screen and latch onto your face. The Count Lucanor wants you to be uncomfortable and increases your discomfort gradually as you progress. As you piece together the story you're about to unfold, you keep finding out more unfortunate things. I'd probably call this light horror, even with some of the chunky and gooey bits we see in game. Don't go into this thinking you're going to scream and start getting jumpscares. This is not that kind of game.\n\nAs always because I'm the one who has to make a note of it, here's your health info from someone who does things she shouldn't. There are not that many scenes of flashing lights. It's a video game, you're going to expect some. Sure. But these were pretty low and dimmed. I got the effects of "whooosh magical powers activated" and didn't get flashed into Migraine Town. Or Seizure Ville. (Gee why do I still play video games then? Good question.) There's still a few short scenes and if you're sensitive to them, obviously you shouldn't play. But if you're not too badly off, hey you could probably handle it. Otherwise no other problems.\n\nThe only people who should not play this game is if you're not patient. If you're impatient, this game will suck for you. If you can just take five minutes to breathe and think, you'll be fine. I think most people can enjoy this game. If you've got a twisted sense of humor, this is probably something you'll really like. If you just want to send a ten-year-old off to his possible doom for the promise of fame and fortune that may not even be there, then...sure! Sure, great! Get it!","May 2","true","6.8"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","97","28","29","10","2"

The story focuses on a young boy named Hans who has grown tired of being poor and blames his mother for their poverty and for his father's disappearance.\n\nSo on his tenth birthday he decides to abandon his loving home in search of riches. In the woods he encounters a blue kobold that tells him he can inherit great wealth if he can overcome the trials of Count Lucanor and prove his worth. Each trial reveals a letter of the kobold's name which Hans has to piece together to reveal the kobold's name and win!\n\nThe gameplay consists of solving puzzles, avoiding traps, stealth (Hans can't kill the monsters) and using candles to illuminate the dark rooms in the castle.\n\nCandles never run out and you have to strategically place them so you can have a clear view of your surroundings. Monsters do a lot of damage if they get you and healing items are limited so walking around blind will only lead to death. Also, to save the game you have to spend your money so you can not save every few seconds which in my opinion is a big plus in horror games.\n\nThe characters you will meet are either charming or creepy and I love their design and backstories/agency. The cutscenes are beautiful and it is hard to believe someone can create something so gorgeous using pixel art.\n\nYour first playthrough should take you about 6 to 7 hours to complete but there are multiple endings and secrets to keep you coming back for more.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend the game to fans of pixel horror games.","March 3","true","19.5"," 44 of 58 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","44","58","3","2"

On his birthday he get's angry at his mom and runs away from home to look for treasure. Meeting a few people a long the way, Hans passes out and wakes up in a nightmarish world where he is led to a castle where he has to complete the trials of Count Lucanor to win all of his treasures.\n\nWhen the developers said that this game is based on those two titles, they are not joking about it. The looks maybe childish, but trust me this game is not suitable for children. The game is incredibly violent and not to mention it's pretty scary at moments.\n\nWhile the horror elements are borrowed from Silent Hill, the adventure aspect is borrowed from Legend of Zelda. Now while you can't fight against the monsters you can hide giving the game some stealth segments. But what they borrow the most is the adventuring and puzzle solving. The puzzles are perfect and figuring them out is a great feeling. All of the puzzles are not cryptic what so ever, so everyone can solve them no problem.\n\nThe art style is fantastic and is one of my favorite looking indie games. The cutscenes are awesome and the game graphics are awesome as well. Everything looks crisp and is pleasing to the eye.\n\nThe game might prove difficult to some because you need coins to save the game and every save costs 1 coin, the game tries to help and makes the coins the most common items in chest, but you will also need food to keep your health up, so you don't die.\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty decent, nothing too special, I wished it was more memorable, but it's still pretty good and helps out in the more tense moments in the game.\n\nThe game ran perfectly and I encountered zero bugs while playing.  I think if you have a good PC you shouldn't have any problems running this title.\n\nThe game lasted me 3 hours, but the game has tons of replay value, cause there's 5 total endings to see and all of them require different choices to be made in the game.\n\nOverall, I can safely say The Count Lucanor is a fantastic title and I highly suggest all of you to play through it as well. It's well worth the full price purchase.\n\nFinal Rating:\n8.5/10 - Worth Purchasing at Full Price\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","March 22","true","3.2"," 35 of 44 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","35","44","0","0"

It hits all the right notes for a fun adventure game.\n\nAmazing pixel art, and even better sound and music directly. It really brings the world to life, and ambient sounds especially. Nothing like hearing a blood crazed murdering goat breathing heavily in the dark before even getting close to it.\n\nSo what's the adventure like? Rather cliché at first, and then things take a horrible turn for the worst. This could all have been avoided if there was no underage drinking. Damnit Hans you silly little boy!\n\nAfter the funky little set up, things go horribly wrong for Hans; only to get a glimmer of hope in the form of a riddle that would change his life for all time. Although can you manage it? You're a little ten year old dolt, wondering around a seemingly haunted castle trying to solve a riddle, while almost everything can kill you. Is it fun though? Oh most certainly, I couldn't put this game down, and I've been playing since pre-release.\n\nThe the game isn't too challenging with puzzles, but the dialogue, explorations, art, music, and the world is just so enthralling. Trying to keep this silly would be count child alive is a joy, and the people and things he runs into even more so.\n\nThe save system is a little odd though, and it forces you to strictly manage the coins you find. As you leave the main game area there is a fountain with a Raven. Toss in a single gold coin and he saves your soul; which is saving the game at that point for you. You do need gold for food, candles, and keys though; so manage it all wisely.\n\nPlay your cards right and there's a Donkeycorn though; which if you feed it apples will poop out some gold coins for you. Even food needs to be used sparingly though. Hans is very weak, he's a child, and almost everything can hurt the little chap. So you need food to heal up.\n\nCandle on the other hand are even more essential; you need light. Without it all manner of nasties can, and will sneak up on you and kill you. So you need to not only walk around with one, but you need them to light brazers and place them around dark parts of the castle so as to make sure things aren't hiding in the shadows later, or following you.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are simple enough, but fantastically executed, and really adds to the game.\n\nIt's a great little adventure so far, and I really would recommend it to pixel art adventure fans.\n\nPC Gameplay\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGWYpAI5kh8","March 3","true","5.9"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","23","29","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vittorioe/recommended/440880/","vittorioe","Vittorio E","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vittorioe/","162 products in account","I'm going to give this game a recommendation, but with a warning that it may not be for everyone.  It only takes about 5 hours to complete, maybe an hour more if you want to unlock all of the achievements, and you will see about 95% of what the game has to offer in only one playthrough.  The room puzzles are fairly simplistic - they consist of block/lever puzzles, avoiding tiles with traps, and timing your movements over grates that periodically spew fire.  There are also a few objects you need to find and bring to another location, but they are all very obvious solutions.  The controls are adequate for completing the tasks, but movement is slow, and overall a little clunky.\n\nThankfully, the game compensates for these shortcomings with a nice little story (think Wizard of Oz but more demented), and a cast of characters that manage to be both horrifying and charming at the same time.  The pixel art cut-scenes are lovely, and the baroque music is very evocative, although it would be nice if there was more of it.  I strongly suggest not watching the videos or looking at the screenshots, as they give away many of the most pleasant surprises.\n\nThis game is being over-shadowed at the moment by lengthier indie games with more content, but I do hope it finds its audience eventually.  It was compelling enough that I did play through to the end, which is becoming something of a rarity as my Steam library has grown to a ridiculous size.","March 13","true","6.8"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/440880/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","If you've never read any of the original tellings of stories like Little Red Riding Hood or Hansel and Gretel, it might surprise you to learn how grim and grotesque they could be. Indeed, old fairy tales are deep wells for inspiration, yet few games seem to dip into them. The Count Lucanor certainly does, going so far as to invent its own fairy tale structure to fit the creepy storybook adventure presented.\n\nYou take on the role of Hans (yes that is a boy) on his tenth birthday. Unsatisfied with life as a classic cottage-dwelling poor, he sets off into the dark woods in search of fortune and glory. What he finds is the castle of Count Lucanor, who has promised his fortune to anyone who can survive his trials. The trials, of course, are incredibly fatal but there's a whole cast of colorful characters to help you puzzle through mostly unscathed. Most of the game is searching for items like prybars and magic rings to solve puzzles, along with a healthy dose of survival horror hoarding of health and utility items.\n\nDon't let the cartoonish cutscenes and blocky graphics fool you, there's a very strong horror bent to this title. Hans' journey takes on nightmarish qualities in a hurry, and the enemies can be downright chilling when they stalk you through the darkness. Proper resource management plays a big part in staying alive, and while I won't spoil any of the systems I will say that your first playthrough will have some interesting and difficult choices to make concerning the things you find. You'll also have tough choices to make with the many characters you encounter, because more than a few of them are not what they seem.\n\nWhile there's plenty of mysteries and puzzles to solve, the overall game is not a long one. You'll probably reach an ending within three hours or so, though there are quite a few endings to find and each is very different. The game is broken into two major areas with a short intro section and a shorter conclusion, so don't bank on sprawling maps or grand journeys. The challenge isn't terribly high either once you learn how to deal with the castle's threats, which means you're unlikely to get stuck at any particular point.\n\nThe presentation does a lot to endear the game, between the charming graphics and quality sound design. The pixel graphics might put some off but it reminds me of The Last Door, clear enough to be useful but vague enough to let my mind enhance the horror. Of particular note are the cutscenes, which are beautifully animated and evoke the best parts of 80s anime. The writing is just as charming, and as I mentioned the sounds are perfect, with heavy footsteps and cackling monsters to menace you throughout. There's a lot to love about The Count Lucanor, and as long as the length isn't a hangup you'll find plenty of spooks and surprises here.","March 3","true","2.9"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","17","24","0","0"

You can read it there with glorious formatting and images, or just the text (without image captions) below. DISCLAIMER: Game played on retail code provided by the developer.\n\n\nPlaying The Count Lucanor made me realize how rare fairy tale games are on the PC, and this game is very much a video game of a fairy tale. A tad on the grim side, perhaps, much like pre-Disney stories were, but a fairy tale nonetheless. With its pixel graphics and Bach’s works turned into chiptune as a soundtrack, as well as a few cutscene sequences that’ll remind you of a Studio Ghibli film, there’s little doubt that in the aesthetics department the game is well furnished – and what of the rest?\n\nYou’re Hans, a ten year-old boy who lives in a small cottage in the woods with his mother – your father, a man of the military, has been away to fight the war for as long as you can remember. Disgruntled by the lack of cake on his birthday (don’t judge – have you ever not had cake on your birthday? Exactly), Hans decides its time to strike out and make his fortune.\n\nHow you interact with the world is fairly simple and doesn’t change much as the game progresses – as you play you’ll find items, which can be used given certain circumstances by equipping them and interacting with a specific person/location/object – and doesn’t diverge much from what you’d expect of a typical adventure game. Your health can be recovered by eating food, of which there’s an abundant supply.\n\nAfter a first, relatively short section where you go through the woods in search of adventure – interacting and helping (or not) the people and animals you meet – and where everything is shiny and sunny, you might start questioning if the ‘horror’ tag is legitimate. That question is answered soon after you wake up from a drunken stupor to find yourself in a night-twisted, horror version of the world you’d seen up to now.\n\nIt begins with you meeting a red-eyed raven, an ill-omen as you’d earlier observed, and then crossing a river of blood. The goatherder you’d met is now a decapitated, bloody man, the goats he watched closer to weregoats, bipedal and with ranks of sharpened teeth. It is as if the world went from what people expect fairy tales to be to what they usually were – somber and grim, and certainly not the best place for little children to play hero.\n\nYour hero’s trial is soon presented to you, as a mysterious Kobold with a jester’s cap guides you to a castle where the Count has set a series of trials to find a suitable heir, as he managed to father none. Your task is rather simple: to find out the name of the Kobold, which you’ll do by going through several puzzles and hazards in different rooms to recover each letter and then piecing them in the correct order.\n\nWhile things quickly escalate, with caped monsters, goatmen and a crimson man who will kill you on sight, the puzzles and hazards of the game are never particularly difficult. As a treasure hunter you’ll meet tells you, it isn’t your job to face these monsters, but rather to avoid them – and armed with just a few candles to illuminate the dark castle, that’s exactly what you have to do. As the puzzles never stray too far from the obvious, it isn’t on this merit that the game rides, but on that of its ambiance and your interactions with the other denizens and visitors to the castle. While the game had no bugs during my playthrough, the pathing for the monsters glitched several times, getting them stuck in a loop or blocking your progress until you reset the room by leaving and coming back.\n\nThe people you met when you first ventured out from your cottage are all here, with their own peculiar nightmarish twists, and interacting with them will teach you more of their personality and story, and of what they feel towards the other people present in the castle. Throughout these interactions you’ll not only gain tools to further your interests, but decide (some of) their fates and how much you’ll actually bother do aside from what is presented as the ‘main trial’. A single playthrough took me around four hours, though if I were to go back in order to see the different outcomes certain actions could have, and all of the separate endings, that time could easily have been doubled.\n\nWith gameplay that doesn’t really set it apart from other adventure games (though you control your character more like you would in a 2D Zelda game than your typical point n’ click adventure game) and a forgiving difficulty, what set The Count Lucanor apart from other games – and it does stand separated, with a charm of its own – is its macabre presentation and the beautiful cutscenes. While pixel graphic games have been hit or miss recently, the presentation in The Count Lucanor – sound effects, graphics and soundtrack – is entirely cohesive and only furthers the whole fairy tale aspect of the game, and was enough to make me thoroughly enjoy my short romp with it.","March 3","true","9.0"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","14","21","0","0"

I purchased it prior to becoming a beta tester.\n\nI'm not gonna go into too much into details, because it would be spoilery, and the game deserves to not be spoiled. Here goes:\n\nI went in expecting a nice little indie game, with somewhat ok mechanics and an interesting story. I was mainly looking for something to lull me to sleep.\nBegan the game at 3am, expecting to fall asleep half an hour later. At 6am, I was still fully awake, at the edge of my seat. Somehow, the little blurry pixels manage to create a tension I haven't felt since I was a kid. I actually wrote to the guys "I haven't been that afraid since the first Silent Hill, when I was a kid", before even knowing Silent Hill was referenced in the blurb.\n\nSo far, I'm enjoying this a lot. The only downside is the walking speed is a bit too slow for my taste, but I can't deny a faster pace might impact negatively the feeling of tension that I enjoy so much, so I'm not even certain it's a bad point.\n\nGraphically, it's either your cup of tea or it's not. Personally, I love the illustrations, but I liked the in-game graphics a bit less. After playing though, I feel like the lack of details is a smart choice for the game, and I wouldn't want it to look any different. It allows a lot of the action to happen in your head, and that's much more frightening than the most realistically rendered 3D monster.\n\nOtherwise, dialogues are smart and fun, puzzles varied and just challenging enough (and don't really feel like puzzles), mechanics to the point and relevant (you never feel like there's some tacked-on mechanic just for the sake of). Despite the slow walking, they even manage to put in quite a lot of movement-based challenges, so don't be deceived by the stills, this is not a walk-and-talk game. I wouldn't say the challenges are taxing on reflexes (anyone with a bit of gaming experience could probably clear them), but they're still movement and position-based.\nSound design is really good too, layered, deep, and accurate.\n\nFinally, do not think this is an easy game. Sure, it's no Dark Souls, but it's not a walk in the park either. And you have to *buy* save points. This creates a wealth of interesting behaviors on your part as you try to manage your money and your play time efficiently.\n\nI can't say for sure if anyone would like this game, but I'm fairly certain a varied audience can find enjoyment in it. If you like narratives, you'll like it. If you like puzzles, you'll like it. If you like exploration, you'll like it. If you like fright, you'll like it...And so on.\n\nThe Count Lucanor borrows from multiple sources but manages to be quite a healthy dose of more than the sum of its inspirations.

This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================The Count Lucanor is a charming pixel-graphics adventure game with a horror theme, trading the guns and zombies that are common to the theme for candles and goat monsters.\n\nYou play Hans, a 10-year-old boy sick of being poor and longing for a life of adventure and riches. The game begins on your 10th birthday when you leave your home and your mother and set out on your own on the path into the woods.\n\nThe game introduces you to a number of strange and eerie characters and environments as you try to prove yourself worthy of the riches of the Count of Lucanor.\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - The graphics are a blend of charming pixel graphics and higher-resolution portraits, which are displayed in conversations. The introductory video is very well done and reminds me of a late 80s or early 90s adventure game, which is presumably exactly what the developers were going for.\n\nThe world around you is dynamically lit based on whether you are carrying a candle or not, and whether you have lit parts of the scenery or positioned other candles around you. It's a nice mechanic and the graphics engine handles it well.\n\nCharacters are, for the most part, likeable collections of pixels, while monsters are much more scary looking. The goats, in particular, are decidedly unpleasant.\n\nSound - The sound effects range from acceptable to very good, with nothing to complain about. The music, however, is excellent throughout, with a retro midi feel to it that really suits the atmosphere the game generates.\n\nGameplay - The game sees you exploring, collecting items, and trying to solve puzzles, most of which are fairly straightforward. Being a 10-year-old boy, you can't really fight, so you also need to be on the lookout for hiding places in which you can hide from any monsters you encounter. The game introduces an original game mechanic, too, in the form of candles that never burn out. These you can place strategically about to ensure that you have sufficient warning of an approaching monster, providing you with enough time to reach one of your hiding places.\n\nThe game interface is minimal and controls are simple enough that they'll take you only a minute to learn.\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ Charming graphics\n+ Nice retro atmospheric music\n+ An interesting story, with weird characters and monsters\n+ Multiple endings and achievements, for increased replayability\n+ Trading cards\n\nCons:\n- There's a fair bit of backtracking, although at least it's within the confines of a relatively small area\n- The game penalises you for saving and then punishes you for not saving; I didn't find that very fun\n- Although the text is mostly very good, another proofread wouldn't go astray as I found a few grammar errors\n\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================The Count Lucanor is an original and fun homage to retro gaming, while also introducing some interesting and unique gameplay. It does have its faults, but if you're interested in a horror setting and you can appreciate great pixel graphics and retro sound, you should pick it up and give it a shot.\n\n7/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","March 4","true","3.3"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","11","16","3","0"

In some ways it sort of feels like I was transported back in time and I'm playing King's Quest or The Black Cauldron on the old Apple IIe in the 1980's again. Even though I get hints of those older games within Lucanor it's still very much it's own unique styled game.\n\nYou play the role of a young boy named Hans who has just celebrated his 10th birthday. Han's becomes a  runaway after growing tired of his poor rural life with his mother. So he decides to set out to seek adventure and fortune.\n\nAlong the way you encounter a strange mystical being who leads you to the imposing castle of Count Lucanor. Here you'll be put through a trial of tests to judge whether you are worthy or not of inheriting the Count's title and fortune. Soon enough you'll discover it's not easy to tell where reality begins and illusion ends within the dark depths of this castle.\n\nThe main plot of the game involves Han's exploring the castle, trying to unlock the riddle of the blue Kobold's name in order to inherit the fortune of the illustrious Count Lucanor! You might find the more you explore the castle the more questions you'll begin to ask yourself. With the tale taking on a new twist later in game.\n\nYou'll come across a few puzzles and certain areas that involve timing in order to avoid traps and monsters scattered about the castle. Each room generally offers you some sort of hint or allows you a way to gain access to one of the chests holding one of the letters in the blue Kobolds name. Your end goal is to collect all 8 letters and attempt to solve the name puzzle in order to get behind the curtain and unlock your destiny.\n\nThere are many other items hidden away in chests and other background objects, like food for energy, coins for purchasing items and using for saving the game, candles which you can strategically lay throughout the castle in order to try an avoid being caught by surprise by one of the resident baddies, along with a bunch of other random items needed to complete certain puzzles and challenges. You're given no weapons to defend yourself in this game. The only thing you have to keep you alive are your wits and a good hiding space should you be spotted.\n\nMusic is fairly simplistic but enjoyable chiptune sounds that fit well with the graphic style and period setting of the game and further serves to enhance the ambience of the dark old castle. It ranges from the upbeat an melodic, to dark heavy and haunting. The sound effects are also particularly well done and used well throughout the game. From the gentle running water, to the clattering of goat bells along side the peaceful shepard whistling in his sleep... up to the more frightening stuff you encounter later in game without wanting to spoil anything. I think they did a great job in all aspects of sound.\n\nThe game has some great dark humor moments especially within characters like the disgusting Eisbein. The English language version dialogue seems a little bare bones but never comes out as jibberish or hard to understand.\n\nThe art style looks great. The pixels are usually detailed enough to always allow you to know what you're looking at. The cutscene animations are exceptionally beautiful. With the exception of a few of the background characters you see in one of the cut scene endings, which I felt weren't quite up to the same quality standard compared to what I saw in most of the other cut scenes.\n\nAs for controls, I've tested the game with a keyboard and Xbox 360 pad. Both of which worked fine on my system. The game does have a few bugs here an there. I wasn't even able to get past the opening prologue until a recent patch fixed it for me. The devs seem very dedicated to fixing any bugs an issues that arise so support for this game seems very soild.\n\nThe game will probably only last you about 3 to 5 hours. It's a bit short and a little slow at times since you're only able to walk at a normal pace throughout the game. The game features quite a few multiple endings some of which are pretty good while others seem to just be a bit of filler.\n\nNone the less, it has alot of charm and alot of love thrown into this fun little twisted game. Would recommend buying it for sure. Even though it's a bit short I'd still say it's worth purchasing at full price. I'd rate the game as a whole around an 8 out of 10!","May 29","true","8.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Things then obviously take a turn for the horribly worse. Despite first appearances, this is a real horror game.\n\nIf the premise of The Count Lucanor sounds like a fairy tale, that's because it's based on a Spanish book of fables of the same name. Add to that the fact that the soundtrack is chiptuned Bach and you can already see this is a game with an interesting pedigree.\n\nThe game opens with an absolutely gorgeous pixel art video of Hans playing with his dog in a sunny field. It's so good I'd almost like to see an entire animated movie in that style. What is strange, however, is that the actual game has a quite low pixel count, although still serviceable. Why does a horror game put some much effort in an idyllic opening? If anything, this decision makes the game feel even more unnerving. The cartoon portraits during text conversations are very well detailed, however. In fact, some of them are terrifying in their own right. Sound effects are also top notch. If you ever wondered what the snapping jaws of a death goat sounds like, you're in for a treat. Considering the game was made by a handful of people, the overall presentation of the game is top notch.\n\nThe actual meat of the game is puzzles, light exploration and inventory management, in the same vein as Yume Nikki or Corpse Party but a little bit more involved. It's nothing too taxing, just enough to keep you engaged in the tale, which is what The Count Lucanor is all about.\n\nBefore reaching the castle, Hans meets several people on the road which can be helped, or not, by sharing the meager provisions you mother gives you and asks you to use wisely. These choices will have consequences and the prologue acts as a little morality tale. In fact, this is one of the game’s greatest strength: The Count Lucanor is a game that gives choices to the player and acknowledge them, even if just in a small way. You may be asked to do terrible things and whether you do them or not the end result will be the same, but seeing how scenes can play out a little bit differently is a reward in itself. I won’t spoil who the characters are, but they’re generally quite interesting. I mean, look at that creepy blue imp thing? What could its deal be? Play the game to find out.\n\nThe Count Lucanor is an outstanding short horror game, just long enough to shock and awe, but without any filler. I wish I could’ve gone into more detail, but it’s really better delve into it without knowing too much. Definitely recommended for horror fans.","May 18","true","5.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As luck would have it, I was even able to beta test the game prior to release. Had I not beta-tested, however, I would still happily pay the full amount for a chance to play it again. It's that good.\n\nThe game has the exploration and incredible depth of an adventurous RPG, mixed the stealth and scares of a traditional survival horror game.  Stating that it's a good mix of Zelda and Silent Hill is definitely not far off, but it's so much more than just that. This game should be given the credit it deserves for building upon the original inspiration and creating something all its own. I would love to see more games like this one.\n\nThe Count Lucanor is one twisted fairytale.  The simplistic pixelated graphics are intercut with some truly beautiful cutscenes. The colors are rich, the character design and overall style is unique, the music wonderful, and the immersive quality of this game is undeniable. It's not heavy-handed either, with plenty of humor. You can spend hours exploring and finding something new. There are multiple endings, and along with it many achievements, giving ample opportunity for replayability.

Having a lovely pixel based game sweeped me off my feet and I bought it as soon as I saw not even 30 seconds of gameplay. From the visuals to the plot to the characters alone... I truly adore this game.\n\nThe game starts out with a lovely cinematic showing the main character, Hans. Hans has just turned 10 today and he really is unhappy with how his family is living... His father is off to war, his family being poor, and most importantly that he won't get any sweets or toys for his birthday! This sparks the start of the adventure as Hans (aided with some helpful items from his mother) ventures off into the woods to get some sweet loot.\n\nThe game is simple when it comes to it's regular looks, but the cinematic scenes are truly something. They look wonderful and pleasing. The character designs are fun to look at and made me want to doodle them while I was playing! There is a good amount of thought put into each character and you can tell there was a lot of fun happening while making the game.\n\nFor the plot itself, I found it... A tad predictable. But then again, I'm the type of person that reads waaay too much into a game while I'm playing it. And even though I predicted the game.... I eventually got so into it I forgot I predicted anything! The endings are all well done, and the "better" endings are definitely satisfying. It gives you a feel of older, simpler games, but it is definitely complex.\n\nI would (and already am) suggest The Count Lucanor to all my buddys! A lovely game with a simple premise......

Then play the second best game I've played in a really long time. This one. The Count Lucanor delivers on its promises of having your choices matter. It's got multiple endings, so unless you use a guide and knock them all out in one playthrough *cough* you'll have plenty of replay value here. Even then, there's more than one solution to some problems.\n\nThe writing in this game is top notch. I love the characters. I haven't read the story this is based on, cause it's from like 1899 and I'd never heard of it til I played this game, but you shouldn't go looking it up until after you've beaten the game for blatant spoiler reasons. So I dunno how well it sticks to the source material. But I don't really care, either.\n\nIn terms of graphics, it's got that whole old school video game vibe going for it, with some pretty portraits and beautiful cutscenes tossed in. If you're bothered by retro graphics then you probably didn't play Undertale either, and you and I just don't have much to talk about. Why are you even reading this? Go back to your shiny new age games, if you can't handle a few pixels.\n\nThe music's alright. Fit's the vibe, can be quite creepy at times. I'm not going to be blaring it from my car speakers as I drive to work in the mornings, but it's all well composed and doesn't get too repetative.\n\nThe gameplay is one of this game's strongpoints. It may look like a point and click adventure but I played the whole thing using a controller and never had any issues. The Count Lucanor is a challenging game, but it's not an unfair one. There's a few hard achievements and you're going to die in this game (Hans isn't the fastest on his feet so if you walk in front of certain enemies you'll lose a lot of blood before you can get away) but there's plenty of healing items if you know where to look and only use them when you need to. The puzzles are relatively easy; there's no Siera logic to worry about. Just save every time you think you've accomplished something signifigant and you'll be fine. If you didn't do things a certain way you might get stuck on the game's most direct puzzle, but if you keep at it you'll figure it out eventually. Or you'll give up and look up the answer. I'm not gonna judge you. This is a safe place.\n\nOverall I found this to be a very rewarding experience. It's fun, it's creepy, heck sometimes it's downright scary. I get the feeling I'll be coming back to this one again and again over time, even after I've done a full Let's Play of it. You may develop a fear of livestock from playing this game, and you'd come by it honestly. Give The Count Lucanor a shot and you'll be hooked too. Buy it on sale if you have to, but I bought it at full price (it's cheap) and have no regrets.

With stealth, there's this mechanic where you can place candles around (They don't go out), so you can note enemy behavior and plan your path accordingly.\n\nMy problem here is with the enemy AI. If an enemy is chasing you, you can easily kite them and avoid their attacks. Also, you don't have to worry too much about stealth. Even if they detect you, you can go into a hiding spot right in front of them and lose aggro. Things like these just took me out of the experience too much. Can't feel the tension right?\n\nThe puzzles themselves are fine, keeps you going.\n\nAs for the tale (Do note I only played it once), it starts off rather well and the character introductions really hook you in. It's just that as time goes on, not as much is done with the characters and the tale is if but a tad predictable (Might pay to note again here about how much the lackluster gameplay takes you out of the experience). I would have liked to have seen more character interactions and for the overall story to just tie in together better? Just felt a bit let down at the end.\n\nThere are multiple endings, although I just completed it once and saw the rest on youtube.\n\nOverall, I can't really recommend it unless something about it really appeals to you and the aforementioned problems won't bother you as much.\n\nP.S - Would like to say that I hope the developer makes more games of this sort.

Both games are excellent in their own rights, but they are not the same. Undertale is a charming RPG in which you can either befriend everyone or slaughter everyone. The Count Lucanor is a survival horror game (although still charming) in which you overcome a hurdle of creepy baddies and traps to find letters, and ultimately guess the kobold's name.\n\nI must say that I appreciate the fact that this horror game doesn't focus so heavily on jumpscares. In fact, the "jumpscare" moments end up being more funny than anything (I think on purpose). The game relies more on legitimate tension, because if these enemies see you, you're going to have a bad time (heheh). Even though the enemies aren't the sharpest tools in the shed, they still pose quite a threat to you with the kind of damage they deal (especially a certain character that I will not name).\n\nSomething that I learned in this game was to take absolutely nothing for granted. What I thought would be useless garbage ended up being some of the most vital parts of the game. Decisions you make in the beginning will help you piece together certain things when it truly matters. Bear in mind that this game has multiple endings, so you might find yourself replaying this game once or twice; I know I did. Once everything in this game has clicked with you, getting the more satisfying endings will be a piece of cake.\n\n10/10 I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it.\n\nP.S.

Its a hard game to really describe but it seems like one of those point and click games but its not. Its kinda like a hide and seek game with monsters as you try and solve the mystery/curse of the castle. Its got a cute story and likeable characters.\n\nIf you do happen to want to buy the game, then I believe you will be statisfied with the experience that you get from it. I believe the price is fair but if your in no hurry to buy the game then I think waiting for it to go on sale wouldnt be that bad of an idea as well.\n\nThere are mosters in the game but I dont really thik there that scary. You can easily avoid them with the hiding spots that the game gives you and tey give you a reasonable amount of food items to heal you as well. There are puzzles but their not that hard to figure out. This game also rewards you in the long run, if you play the nice goodie too shoes character then a cruel and selfish one. There are some youtubers as well who are playing the game like "rpgminx" is going a series on it right now I believe, so if you want a visiual example of the game then go watch her videos.\n\nBut over all, I like the game, it was cute with its pixel art, the music was okay - there wasn't anthing amazing about the music but it wasn't bad either. Would I say to still buy the game, ever after I have played it? Yes I would still buy it. There were also mysteries in the game that i wasnt able to fine in the first play through so if your a dictated gamer then you could probabaly go about three-four runs through the game before you finsih ever thing.\n\nOver all I give the game 8 out of 10!\n\nThe only cons were: the music could have been better and there was a boss fight near the end but the boss was kinda irritating but I did beat it on the first try kinda (spoiler you dont really beat the boss but you grab like an item and then leave kinda deal) and the last con is that you need candles in the game to see, so I wish they gave you more candles. They give you a pretty desient amount as you go through the game but I wish they had given you a butt-ton instead.","May 4","true","3.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

It's their first game although you wouldn't think it with the overall mood and pixelated graphics cobining to make for one of the most immersive game I've played this year.\n\nThe game follows Hans, a young boy who leaves home and his mother behind in search of castles of gold and adventure. As stories go, things do not go as planned and Hans becomes trapped in Count Lucanors castle. A being called Kobold informs that he must pass a series of trials in order to become the new heir to the count's fortune. The first trial, to guess the Kobold's real name. And so the game begins.\n\nYou spend your time exploring rooms for letters, avoiding traps/monsters and placing candles to light the dark corners of castle. There're very few characters but they are all well imagined and interesting to talk to so it's not so bad.\n\nThe game will take you four-ish hours to finish if you decide to do everything and you more than likely will. It encourages  replayability and I found myself playing parts over again to get achievements simply because they added that bit more to the story. Also there are five different endings in total.\n\nOverall the music is great and the sound quality is relatively good. Noting I can say bad about this game.\n\nIf you like Zelda or rpg horror games like Ib you will definitely enjoy this.","March 5","true","1.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

(However they have a safe launch which may solve this issue.)\nThe only other annoyance was having the screen go blank after a cutsceen which would require me to redo the scene I just got done with over again which became a problem when the last save was several puzzels ago or right after a challenging part in the game.

The atmosphere is really amazing and the creators made the best use of the graphic style, light and music to get the right reactions. As far as the story and atmosphere goes the game is really worth the money.\n\nThe only problem I encountered were some slight troubles with the enemy AI. Sometimes enemies would get stuck in corners, blocking my path and making it impossible for me to reach the areas I had too. The enemies does not seem to reset when you leave an area as well so this created a mild annoyance.\n\nAlso on that last topic the enemies are quicker than you and they have attacks that “drag you in” towards them. This was a slight pain in the bum so to speak since at times I would get cornered between two enemies and killed of simply because the attacks wouldn't allow me to escape.\n\nBut these two last points are quiet frankly nit picks and you can work around them. During my hours of play it only happened a handful of times that the enemies would get stuck, otherwise it works just smoothly.\n\nI really recommend this, if you're big on the pixel game market and if you like atmosphere and interesting characters and settings, go for it! The game is certainly worth a buy!","March 3","true","5.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheBoomstick/recommended/440880/","TheBoomstick","Fear The Boomstick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheBoomstick/","219 products in account","I wanted to like The Count Lucanor. The trailer showed its beautiful visual appeal, and I'm a sucker for well developed characters and story. I got a huge kick out of Undertale, which while a little simplistic and saccarine at times (at least on the mercy playthrough), had solid pacing and never grew overambitious. I say this because, when I bought The Count Lucanor, I was really hoping for was another Undertale -- solid gameplay (point and click puzzles instead of bullet hell shooting) with strong narrative to keep me invested.\n\nI just don't feel The Count Lucanor met me half way.\n\nCount Lucanor wants to explore the duality of European fairytale: Something that opens with childhood whimsy but seems to turn morbid the moment the storyteller decides their impetuous little charge is starting to lose interest. It wants to be a "Heinrich Hoffman, eat your heart out" kind of story.  Good concept, I was behind it 100% of the way. Depth and dichotomy are the cornerstones of good characters and plot. So where were they, Baroque Decay?\n\nI played this game the way I play most creepy games. I get some friends together with some snacks, and we sit around a computer, alternating who plays and who sits around eating snacks, berating the current player's decisions, and making snarky comment on the dialogue. Pounding horror games in single sittings where psychological fatigue would otherwise slow us down. Good old family fun. But by the end of our most recent session, it was kindly recommended that I return the game and get my $10 back. We made it in about 1.75 hours, so I'm going to do just that.\n\nLet's start with the character, Hans. Hans is your stereotypical fairytale child. He's fussy, entitled (somehow, in spite of being a peasant), and wouldn't be bothered to learn any moral lessons if fate didn't occasionally provide some horrifying shoggoth to sprinkling chopped nuts on his head while he considers his life choices. There wasn't inherently anything wrong with this choice, but it doesn't mean the writers had to forgo making him the slightest bit relatable.\n\nHans is a little prick. Maybe they're setting up his character development for later, but an important part of intriguing characters is that they have redeeming qualities, because otherwise I'm practically thrilled when bad things happen to them. But he's the protagonist, so I'm supposed to be invested in him accomplishing his goals, because otherwise Hans and I have a severe conflict of interest.\n\nIn the time I played, no other characters stood out either. Each one was wholly one-dimensional. I'm sure the excuse could be made that this was in keeping with the European Fairytale theme, where complexity is an afterthought at best, but the use of inspiration is that it's a jumping off point, not a pig sty to wallow in. Characters are simple in fairytales because they're geared towards children.\n\nThe morally choices early on are also blandly inspired by European fairytale, where nuance flies out the window. 3 people will ask you for handouts on the way to your medieval feverdream. Cast out of your mind any questions of, "will this come back to haunt me later?", the answer is no. The items you're given in the game are either readily replaceable, or just plain unnecessary anyway, so the moral dilemma is "do you want these characters to resent you later or not?"\n\nAnd because all those characters are bland and uninteresting anyway, the correct answer is yes.\n\nThe puzzles are ripped directly from The Legend of Zelda, so maybe that'll be a strong point for you. I'm a heretic who never played the series, so Zelda and his green tunic don't hold any nostalgic value to me, and neither do dated block-pushing puzzles. Indie games have the privilege of getting so beautifully experimental with their puzzles because they're not expected to maintain broad accessibility, why you'd settle for the white noise of the puzzle world is a troubling curiosity.\n\nMaybe the experience starts to pick up past the second hour? Sorry Baroque Decay, you knew you were releasing on steam, I don't think asking you to get me hooked within 120 minutes is an absurd request. Theatres earn their $10 on ~120 minutes of content alone, and I can't even tug it during the boring parts.","April 11","false","1.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

It was deliciously creepy though and is certainly one of the more memorable games I've played. No bugs or glitches, everything was polished and ran smoothly. The only issues I have with it is that its kinda really short and that your saves are limited. I finished it really quick and grabbed up a few of the extra endings from a single save in under a few hours and its not that you really need an unlimited amount of saves, but it kind of feels pressuring to know you only have so many. The limited saves really shouldnt cause too many issues though.

If you'd like to read our full review you can find it here: https://www.universalgamingreviews.com/the-count-lucanor-overview-and-review/\n\nThe Count Lucanor is a pixel art horror adventure game that follows the story of Hans, a 10 year old boy who has grown tired of being poor and on his 10th birthday he sets out on an adventure to find riches. Eventually he finds himself in Tenbre Castle where he must guess the name of a goblin to become the heir of Tenebre Castle.\n\nThe game is widely puzzle based and features a wide range of unique ones to solve. Many puzzles are similar in style to the classic Zelda games and are quite fun to solve. Puzzles become increasingly more challenging as you progress through the castle but never become so difficult that they're impossible to figure out.\n\nThe game takes around 5-6 hours total to complete if you're taking your time so it's a short and entertaining romp.\n\nI'll also say that the animation in certain points of the game is also fantastic as is the soundtrack, characters and pixel art. Very well done game overall and highly entertaining. I highly recommend giving it a shot.\n\nThanks for reading our short summary and our full review if you check that out as well.\n\n-Shaun Meyers (Kyo Akiara) out!\n\nHere's our gameplay video as well:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qe0MY9uR3g","March 16","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was deliciously creepy though and is certainly one of the more memorable games I've played. No bugs or glitches, everything was polished and ran smoothly. The only issues I have with it is that its kinda really short and that your saves are limited. I finished it really quick and grabbed up a few of the extra endings from a single save in under a few hours and its not that you really need an unlimited amount of saves, but it kind of feels pressuring to know you only have so many. The limited saves really shouldnt cause too many issues though.

I thought the pacing was a little too slow for my tastes, and I didn't have a lot of direction in the beginning so I felt confused too often. I pressed on, though, and I'm glad I did! The puzzles weren't linear (enter the room, do the puzzle, get the reward) which I liked very much, and the story managed to keep me guessing.\n\nI certainly found the game disturbing and suspenseful, but there isn't much typical stuff like jumpscares or whatever, it's slightly more psychological, I guess. Things can be blatantly terrifying, but it doesn't resort to cheap tricks, which I like. I hear it gets compared to Silent Hill a lot, so I suppose that would be accurate.\n\nI found the characters to be very interesting, especially the Goatherd(er...) and the Red Camerlengo, and I thought the patroling aspect of the game kept me on my toes, especially when RC came into play.

Ugh.\n\nThe only complaint I really have about this game is I felt the endings were a bit lackluster, and I expected, at least, for the true ending(?) to have a bit more meat on its bones, but instead it was pretty similar to another ending with different narration.
