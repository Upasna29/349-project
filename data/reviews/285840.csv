"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/285840/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Enemy Mind is a brilliant concept trapped in a game that's less interesting than it deserves.\n\nThe hook is simple, but oh so ingenious it begs the question why it hasn't been done before (the closest comparison that comes to mind is Driver: San Francisco): instead of playing as any specific ship, you have the ability to reach out and take control of any enemy ship you come in contact with, and it's just as cool as you'd imagine. Whizzing around as a tiny fighter and then jumping into a bombing tanker or alien starship creates a dynamic I haven't found in another game, one where enemies are less obstacles you need to remove but strategic pieces to manipulate the battlefield with. Prioritizing ships so as to save those with the most desirable features to take over later runs contrary to almost every traditional approach to shoot'em'up combat, and something that makes Enemy Mind feel so unusual to play beyond its novel mechanic.\n\nIt's rather a shame then that said mechanic is Enemy Mind's sole strength, and what it throws its entirety behind. Taking as just about every ship often feels weak, and unsatisfying, and though providing you with a finite amount of ammo keeps you from just sticking to a single ship for the entire game, it also becomes rather tiring having to constrain yourself so drastically in order to take enemies out as each shot needs to hit and that's not especially easy to do most of the time. As quickly and often as it comes, death is largely meaningless, with no penalty save the loss of your score and the requirement to replay a little before where you met your untimely doom. This caused the game to almost immediately lose all tension, and once the novelty of taking over enemies wore off I rather lost interest in what I was doing.\n\nAnd I say this having completed Enemy Mind in a meager 2 hours, which is about twice as long as it has interesting things to show you. New enemy types are continually trickled in, but many of them were immediately written off as being rather a lot less functional than those I'd been using already. I wanted to become invested in the narrative, which pieces together the memories of the pilots you've taken over to try and give context to what exactly is happening, but it's so abstract and difficulty to piece together that I was all but entirely lost by the end and only had the haziest of ideas how I got there. I imagine there's a compelling story here, but it tries to tie itself into elements of gameplay that are more interesting in concept than ideal ways to tell a narrative.\n\nEnemy Mind's genius mechanic is so strong that it's worth checking out for it alone, but it's telling that I'm more excited about its ideas being recreated and innovated on in other games than I am about the game itself. It's a solid curiosity and a great proof of concept, I just wish its broader foundation was as engaging.","January 25, 2015","true","3.5"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","34","38","0","1"

The problem is, this hinders the game from achieving greatness. Turning it into something more resembling a puzzle game than a shmup at times.\n\nSee, you gotta switch ships constantly - because they run out of ammo quite quickly. Eventually you will be switching between the same couple of ship-types you feel are clearly better than the rest thanks to superior attack patterns covering more of the screen and higher armour-ratings allowing you to take more hits. Thus the game quickly becomes samey, with wave after wave of identical craft and similar situations all the time. Enemy Mind fails at keeping things fresh - after the first 20 waves you get the idea what this game is all about and to be honest, it is hardly worth checking the remaining 60 or so waves - even the bosses get recycled twice and it is all a bit dull.\n\nThe game also lacks punch, the basic small fighters feel almost like the ship from Defender. Somehow the entire game has a weird eighties-feel to it not unlike a couple of early homecomputer shmups. Everything is kinda small, demanding very precise shooting with beams and projectiles that most of the time are exactly one pixel in height. There is not a whole going on, which may or may not appeal to you - personally, I miss screen-filling enemies, massive explosions, gigantic lasers. Enemy Mind is wimpy at best in that regard - unfortunately the minimalistic aesthetic also becomes problematic on smaller screens (I was forced to go vintage, since the game wouldn't run on my main setup) with easy to miss projectiles and almost invisible mines.\n\nOverall, I feel the game offered too little variation in the three hours it took me to beat the final boss - the weird story only did so much to keep me interested in playing and going for high scores is hardly entertaining and bored me quickly. Might be worth it for that limited eighties-gamefeel, but as far as shmups go I prefer the likes of Astebreed, Satazius or Crimzon Clover.","July 18, 2014","false","2.7"," 36 of 54 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","36","54","0","0"

Time of writing is July 7th 2014, if there have been any patches since then, this review might not be accurate.\n\nSo this game is not bad, let's be clear: I simply am not recommending it as a bullet hell/retro shooter enthusiast for the current price. The system seems unpolished: The bounding box, timing, and rules for what bullets collide with what object just don't have the professional intuitive shine that say, Deathsmiles has. I know I'm comparing a company team to an indie developer, but that doesn't make the problems any less noticeable. Other problems: enemy ships can do things you cannot when you possess them (most egregiously: turning around and shooting the other way), and the teleporting beam trajectory could be better (as is it's rather awkward; also it has a charge up time which has absolutely no user feedback).\n\nBut this game has a story focus! Pretty rare for this type of game. If the gameplay is just average, how is the story? I'd like to know, too. Thoughout the game you get snippets of story, and it creates a very interesting experience... but I personally think the novelty of the gameplay has an expiration far shorter than the time it would require to go through the game twice (to collect all the snippets of story). However, I never actually finished this game, so I don't know how the story concludes. The difficulty for the entire game is, despite the problems named above, quite easy. Dying is infrequent for those experienced with this genre, and there are no difficulty settings to adjust. The boss fights, once you figure out how to win, are also not hard at all. Then you get to the end of the second to last wave and find that it is near impossible. Brick wall. Not many players will proceed past this point.\n\nI might have kept trying if I could actually get to that segment again quickly. But since it's at the end of the wave, you need to replay the entire wave first. Takes about 5 minutes, and it's patronizingly easy the entire time. Imagine taking a math test and every time you made a mistake on a really hard problem, before trying again you are forced to first to solve 50 basic addition problems (2+3=?). I've poured quite a bit of time in this last wave alone, and I can no longer justify repeating the patronizingly-easy-5-minutes-snooze-fest even one more time just to retry a 10 second difficult segment.\n\nDespite my rant, I'd say those who love this genre should pick it up next sale. But even if I didn't have any trouble completing it, I still feel that this game is a one-and-done deal; you'll play it, you might enjoy it, but once you uninstall it you probably won't be revisiting it.\n\nedit- a word","July 7, 2014","false","4.4"," 23 of 37 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","23","37","0","0"

The game lets you choose your ships and your play style, and use your brain for suicidal transitions and tactical conservation. The soundtrack is very retro and the sound effects are very satisfying.

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #57 - Enemy Mind\n\nI cracked a smile right off the bat as I started playing Enemy Mind as it reminded me of playing Gradius on the NES.  It's got the same side-scroller point of view, and the pixel art style has a similar feel to it as well.  I really enjoyed the sound effects as well, they mostly sounded like something you'd hear on an 8 bit machine, mixed with some sounds that I swear sounded like they came right from an Atari 2600.\n\nBut what's most interesting about Enemy Mind is the twist it adds to the typical shooter.  You've probably gotten use to the whole shoot enemies, dodge bullets, and pick up powerups that give you new weapons or other abilities.  In Enemy Mind, you don't pick up powerups, but instead you take over other ships, inheriting their abilities instead.\n\nYou basically have 2 weapons.  One is your offensive weapon, which varies based on what ship you are currently in.  The other is your psychic beam, or whatever you want to call it, that when it comes in contact with another ship, you take it over.  If the beam misses, then it just boomerangs back to you.\n\nThis changes up the gameplay because each ship has a limited amount of hull and ammo.  So you can only take a couple of hits (varying based on what ship you are in), and you have a limited number of shots.  So you're forced to continually bounce between different ships in order to stay alive.\n\nEach ship type has a different weapon, and some of these are exactly what you'd expect in a shooter, varying from your average straight shooting bullets to lasers, to triple-fire shots.  But other ships add some unusual variety, such as the ship that launches itself forward like a missle.  You can even take over asteroids which don't have any offensive capability, but basically just house your consciousness until you can project yourself into something else.\n\nThe game is broken up into multiple levels, with each level being broken up into multiple stages, with the final stage being a boss battle.  If you die then you start over at the beginning of the stage you died on.  You do have a limited number of lives, but you can continue when the game is over.  Also once you progress past a level then anytime you start a new game you can skip levels you have already beaten.\n\nI played with a gamepad, and didn't have any issues with the controls at all.  I also like the fact that it supports a second local player, but I didn't actually try it out with a second person.\n\nI had fun with the game, but it also doesn't look like something that I would play for hours on end.  It seems more like the kind of game where I will get through all of the levels and beat the game, and move on to something else.  It's fun and all, but for me not necessarily a lot of replayability.  So with that in mind, you might be a bit wary of the $9.99 price if you don't think it's something you'll spend a lot of time with.  This might be a better game to pick up on sale or in a bundle.\n\nBut, unlike many shooters I've played, I genuinely feel like Enemy Mind has added something new to the genre and isn't just another generic shooter.  Between it's uniqueness and the well done implementation, this is certainly a game I can recommend checking out.","April 12","true","0.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I've always been a fan of shmups and the unique mechanic of taking over enemy ships was what sold me on it initially.\n\nThe controls are a mixed bag. If you're more accustomed to 16-bit era shoot-'em-up games, you should be fairly comfortable with them. It's about on par with Super R-Type or Gradius III. If you're used to more modern shmups, however, it may be a problem.\n\nThe game itself is fairly short, which is to be expected in this genre. There are 8 levels in all, each with multiple waves of enemies. Each level ends with a boss fight. Some involve fighting a large formation of standard enemies, others involve fighting larger crafts which utilize the ship-swapping ability in different ways. The game can be difficult at times, but considering that you have infinite continues and you continue from the beginning of the last wave you've reached (which is also what happens when you lose a life, oddly enough), it's a little on the easy side. I managed to beat the game in about 3 hours. The replay value for the game stems from the storyline, which varies based on actions you take. So if you don't really care about that kind of thing, it's kind of a wash.\n\nFortunately, there are also some unlockable extras, like an arcade mode that does away with starting at the beginning of each wave (but eliminates contiunes), a boss rush mode, the original proof-of-concept game and two parodies of other games.\n\nGamepad support is great. I had absolutely no problems with my 360 pad. Best of all, there's even an option to switch between both analog sticks and the D-Pad to control both the ship in-game and the menu controls.\n\nIn summary, if you're looking for an old-school horizontal shooter with some unique mechanics, I'd definitely suggest picking this up. On the other hand, if you're looking for a bullet-hell shmup, this game probably won't offer much.","November 4, 2014","true","5.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

After having exhausted your ship's resources - the stream of hostiles only growing - you suddenly teleport to and take over another ship. Your ship fades, lifeless; your ship stays in the fight. You continue thusly, confounded; a new ship approaches. With half the Ammo reserves still remaining, you eject yourself towards and into that different ship; your previous host resumes assaulting you - what was its ally (but your enemy) not a second prior. How are you able to do this? What led to this state of conflict? Where are you? Slowly, revelations occur in the form of fragmented and disjointed memories - your thoughts are hard to discern from the cacophony that is apparent hive-mind...\n\nEach Level is made up of seperate stages. It seems each subsequent Level has one more wave to it. Each Level ends with a unique boss fight. Between the stages and Levels, one or two slides of text. I won't spoil any more than I already have - the story is mainly bound to the intermissions between Levels; those between stages/waves serve as (")exposition(") behind the power you wield.\n\nOf course, the main draw of the game is your power to hijack any celestial vehicle. I am very surprised at the story that is incorporated; I honestly expected none, just a basic "You are a being of pure psychic energy with the uncanny power to take over and control anything you see in order to survive. RT to shoot, LS to move, A to teleport."\n\n(With such basic controls, I doubt playing with a KB+M would hamper in any way, contrary to the disclaimer upon starting the game)\n\nOf course, people will play this FOR that interesting mechanic.\nEnemy Mind maintains a good pace at introducing new ships; each is unique, whether in movement, firing rate/projectile motion, and/or capabilities (won't spoil). A sidescroller, except for a few rare instances, you are perpetually facing/shooting right. Certain ships are able to aim their fire at angles; (almost) all are able to turn around and shoot at you if you failed to destroy them while they were in range, as it were.\nThe shmup is borderline bullethell at times but there is almost always an easily identifiable path, however narrow - beware that precise movements ARE necessary and that certain ships - if even a minute (most would think negligible) amount of the ship is in the line of fire, you will take the hit (perhaps why "This game was designed with a controller in mind" is on the Start Screen).\n\nThere are Extras; unsure if they unlock gradually or after milestones, but at this point, I've two minigames: "Flappity Mind" and "Rock Simulator." Rock Simulator is interesting but a bit grating; I've never played Flappy Bird so I'm inclined to call Flappity Mind unfair/1+1twitchy76me.\n\n"Enemy Mind features an adaptive story system as innovative as its gameplay. Are you ready to unlock the secrets of Enemy Mind?"\nIf ever there was a game that NEEDED to have Achievements implemented, it is apparently Enemy Mind; a way to know how much of the story one has unlocked. I just now read that quote in the Store Description - I initially read the exerpt at the top of the Store Page months ago and instantly wishlisted. Recently bought it and found more depth than expected. From the wording and tone, it leads me to believe that, perhaps if one plays as a pacifist it drastically changes (what of) the story (you get).\n\n\nI was going to recommend this game.

Controls for some ships, particularly the multi-directional ones, are really ugly to work with.  This becomes the primary challenge later in the game, especially when fighting the Oroborous boss.  Segments where you have to swap with debris to get through a debris field are generally dull, and quickly become frustrating when said debris veers offscreen unexpectedly.  This is further compounded by the fact that your swap-shot disappears at the edge of the screen, so it is possible to be lining up for a shot and find that your shot disappears upon firing.  This is also aggravating when you are expecting it to come back, but it gets too close to the edge of the screen and vanishes.\n\nSo good idea, but I can't really recommend it to anyone.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/waltonky/recommended/285840/","waltonky","Puzzlebox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/waltonky/","318 products in account","Second Impression (5 hrs in): Something I noticed as I played through this time: I think the narrative changes depending on how you play. I find this to be, on the one hand, fascinating due to the game's simplicity, while, on the other hand, it's incredibly tedious.\n\nSee, if the narrative is designed the way that I think it is, then it's almost up to chance on what you'll get. I mean, there's definitely an element of skill to it, but it seems very "hope you know the level design and can plan way ahead."\n\nSo that part is a little disappointing. That said, the narrative *is* pretty interesting and it did surprise me when I realzied what exactly was going on. And the story's culmination in the final boss battle was fantastic. It's so simplistic but really rounded out the game in a great way and made it feel complete.\n\nThat said, I do have a few other complaints. The last two levels or so seem pretty grueling. There's this part, right before the last boss, that nearly drove me out of my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mind. It was harder than the damn final boss. Some bosses are sort of recycled. I say sort of because their difficulty is ramped up. However, thei reappearance in what is basically a "super" form is disappointing and it diminishes the special feelings of the first enconters.\n\nOn balance, this game is an interesting take on the side-scrolling shooter. With an engaging story and fun game mechanics that require the player to adjust as they play, Enemy Mind is sure to leave a positive mark on everybody who plays it.\n\nInitial impression (1.4 hrs in): I dig it. Imagine Gradius had a baby with Kirby and you get Enemy Mind. You, as the player, do not control a single, permanent ship. Instead, you hop around from ship to ship, each with a finite amount of health. Once you run out of bullets for a ship, that's it. There's no ammo pickups or anything. You have to literally jump ship and hop into a new one.\n\nEach ship has a different firing mechanism, effectively replacing the traditional "power up" system. So half of the strategy is knowing when's the right time to use particular ships. However, some models clearly stand out from others, and this style of gameplay lends itself to a certain disadvantage on your first runs, as you don't really know what's coming.\n\nIn fact, that's primarily where the challenge lies, at least for me. Do I have a ship that's good for the situation? Sometimes I don't and it's not a big deal because I can still concentrate harder and make do. But on a few other occasions I don't and the difficulty escalates much higher because it's simply not a viable choice in the circumstances. This is probably the game's one downside so far: not every ship is viable in every situation. This it what makes particular ships stand out clearly from the rest, because they have versatility in every situation. You'll find yourself looking for those, a la dominant strategy. However, I do not think this detracts from the game's fun all that much.\n\nSo far, so good. I look forward to playing more soon.","September 26, 2014","true","5.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

Nostrodamus any one? On the other hand, I like Tyrian so difficlulty is not a must nor am I a pro in any way or form. Having said all that, I do not recommend this title. Enemy Mind is a good idea in an underdeveloped monotenous package. The game lacks the finesse of a bullet hell, while also being devoid of the originality of the great console horizontals like Gradius2/5, R type3/4 or even G Darius or Thunder Force 4.\n\nEven worse, The game feels like a puzzle game and not a shooter. The game is broken into levels that are themselves broken into short waves. Variety is slim and new ideas are introduced too slowly, all the while it is hard to tell one wave from another. The game even recycles some of its boss battles... In short, older games such as G Darius, Gaiares or even Einhander in a way, have offered the ability to acquire enemy weapons. Enmey Mind might go one step further, but at the expanse of fun. The narrative does unfold in an intresting manner, though. But narrative is the least component of a shmup.\n\n6","August 23, 2014","false","2.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

In most arcade style space shoot-'em ups, you'll pilot your ship through a level, all the while collecting powerups or weapons that may make your craft stronger. In Enemy Mind, your ship has the ability to take over and "transfer consciousnesses" into any other enemy ship. Each craft also has a limited ammo supply, so you'll usually want to expend your entire ammo clip before transferring over to another ship. This creates a gameplay style where the optimal strategy is also the most fun one: blow all your ammo trying to kill everything on the screen, transfer to another ship, rinse and repeat\n\nThe playstyles and designs of the enemy ships are varied and interesting enough to make it exciting each time you encounter a new type of enemy craft. It makes the player want to take it over immediately and experiment around with how much armor the craft has and how its weapon systems work. Some craft are agile with fast firing, low damage weapons. Some craft are slower with huge area of effect damage style explosions. Some craft are themselves weapons and are designed to be torpedoed into other craft to drill through their hulls. There's also an accompanying story that is played after each stage in the single player campaign, but I almost entirely ignored it. It was doled out in little text lines one at a time and it seemed mostly forgettable and inconsequential.\n\nSummary\nEnemy Mind isn't a revolutionary arcade style shooter, but it's a lot of fun. If you like games like Galaga, you'll have a good time with Enemy Mind. Navigating the bullet hell that the enemies throw at you while throwing back a bullet storm of your own while simultaneously possessing and experimenting with new craft and different playstyles felt really good. The boss battles are challenging and unique. There's also a couch co-op multiplayer mode, but I unfortunately haven't gotten a chance to check it out yet. This seems like the kind of game that would be fun to screw around in for a little while with another friend. I wouldn't go out of your way to buy it immediately, but it's worth a look if you find it discounted on a Steam sale or something like that\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","March 1, 2015","true","2.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/troacctid/recommended/285840/","troacctid","Troacctid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/troacctid/","672 products in account","Enemy Mind is a nifty creative twist on the side-scrolling shooter genre. Instead of controlling your own ship, you play as a psychic entity that can commandeer an enemy ship at will. Just press the button and you can swap into a different ship. It's a simple enough premise, and the game executes on it pretty well--well enough that it feels like a key piece of the gameplay rather than a gimmick.\n\nEach ship has limited ammo, see, so you're forced to jump from ship to ship in order to keep fighting. Levels are designed to nudge you toward playing a wide variety of ships--when you run out of ammo, you won't always be able to hop right into a new copy of the same ship. And the boss fights of each level are built around the mechanic--for example, you might have to jump around a circle of stationary turrets to reach the boss's rotating weak point.\n\nThe story is interesting. It's not you against Bad Guy Aliens. You're dropped into the middle of a war between aliens and humans. (You'll get a different ending depending on which side's ships you use more frequently.) The two factions are, visually, very distinct, and when they're onscreen together they'll actually fight each other. Furthermore, both sides quickly become aware of your presence, and you get to hear them reacting to how you're taking over their minds, which is pretty cool.\n\nSo I like what they did, generally. That being said, there are some flaws. For one, it would be nice to have more variety in the ships. There are a decent amount to choose from, but a lot of them are just variations on "shoot forward in a straight line." Oh, and another thing, it's always forward. You can't turn around. This is definitely problematic, because the enemies CAN turn around, and they WILL come at you from both sides, and you'll just be, like, well, I can't turn around and shoot the guys behind me, so...bleh. Also, you supposedly have a limited numer of extra lives, but in practice, you get unlimited continues, and continuing puts you at the exact same place as respawning, so...what's the point of having lives, exactly?\n\nIn any case, it's a short game--I'm not very good at shooters and I beat it in 3 hours--so it doesn't wear out its welcome. You don't need to invest much time to enjoy this game. I don't know if it's worth $10, but if you have it in your backlog from some bundle or other, I definitely recommend giving it a look, just because it's interesting and it does something new and unique. It's short, it's sweet, and while it's not the best shooter you've ever played, you've probably never played another shooter like it.\n\nP.S. Make sure to check out the Rock Simulator in the Extras section. It is glorious.","March 13, 2015","true","3.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

For some reason, it seems that (for keyboard controls) the movement directions get stuck, and I find my ship getting stuck against the bottom or bottomleft corner. I've tried changing the controls from my arrow keys to wasd, but it doesn't seem to fix the issue completely, as though I regain control of my ship, opening the menu shows that I am still endlessly scrowling down the menu options. The game does state in the opening menu that it is ment to be played with a game pad, but I don't own one so I do not know if this issue exists there.\n\nI'm still recomending this game, in hopes that in the near future this bug gets sorted out.

In most arcade style space shoot-'em ups, you'll pilot your ship through a level, all the while collecting powerups or weapons that may make your craft stronger. In Enemy Mind, your ship has the ability to take over and "transfer consciousnesses" into any other enemy ship. Each craft also has a limited ammo supply, so you'll usually want to expend your entire ammo clip before transferring over to another ship. This creates a gameplay style where the optimal strategy is also the most fun one: blow all your ammo trying to kill everything on the screen, transfer to another ship, rinse and repeat\n\nThe playstyles and designs of the enemy ships are varied and interesting enough to make it exciting each time you encounter a new type of enemy craft. It makes the player want to take it over immediately and experiment around with how much armor the craft has and how its weapon systems work. Some craft are agile with fast firing, low damage weapons. Some craft are slower with huge area of effect damage style explosions. Some craft are themselves weapons and are designed to be torpedoed into other craft to drill through their hulls. There's also an accompanying story that is played after each stage in the single player campaign, but I almost entirely ignored it. It was doled out in little text lines one at a time and it seemed mostly forgettable and inconsequential.\n\nSummary\nEnemy Mind isn't a revolutionary arcade style shooter, but it's a lot of fun. If you like games like Galaga, you'll have a good time with Enemy Mind. Navigating the bullet hell that the enemies throw at you while throwing back a bullet storm of your own while simultaneously possessing and experimenting with new craft and different playstyles felt really good. The boss battles are challenging and unique. There's also a couch co-op multiplayer mode, but I unfortunately haven't gotten a chance to check it out yet. This seems like the kind of game that would be fun to screw around in for a little while with another friend. I wouldn't go out of your way to buy it immediately, but it's worth a look if you find it discounted on a Steam sale or something like that\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","March 1, 2015","true","2.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The challenge is spot-on and the levels and ships all look and control fantastically for a two-button shooter.\n\nThere's coop if you're into that but the single-player game is highly replayable. No achievements which puts you in complete control of what and how much you want to play whenever you want to. There are also fun yet useless side games (one immitates flappy bird with a spaceship and another has you going through an entire chapter as a floating meteor in space) as well as a boss rush mode. Oh and the graphics are sharp, detailed and the soundtrack is pitch perfect.\n\nThe only nag I have with the game is that although it has great variety in enemies, there isn't much in the bosses. The later ones are just stronger versions of the original with a new move.\n\nThe shooting is frantic and enjoyable and the story is vague enough to justify the happenings, although you're better off ignoring it altogether. Enemy Mind constantly puts you in a strategically action focused situation and all of it is exhillirating for such a small game.  It will put a grin of satisfaction on your face the moment you start playing.\nBuy this!","January 10, 2015","true","4.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/troacctid/recommended/285840/","troacctid","Troacctid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/troacctid/","672 products in account","Enemy Mind is a nifty creative twist on the side-scrolling shooter genre. Instead of controlling your own ship, you play as a psychic entity that can commandeer an enemy ship at will. Just press the button and you can swap into a different ship. It's a simple enough premise, and the game executes on it pretty well--well enough that it feels like a key piece of the gameplay rather than a gimmick.\n\nEach ship has limited ammo, see, so you're forced to jump from ship to ship in order to keep fighting. Levels are designed to nudge you toward playing a wide variety of ships--when you run out of ammo, you won't always be able to hop right into a new copy of the same ship. And the boss fights of each level are built around the mechanic--for example, you might have to jump around a circle of stationary turrets to reach the boss's rotating weak point.\n\nThe story is interesting. It's not you against Bad Guy Aliens. You're dropped into the middle of a war between aliens and humans. (You'll get a different ending depending on which side's ships you use more frequently.) The two factions are, visually, very distinct, and when they're onscreen together they'll actually fight each other. Furthermore, both sides quickly become aware of your presence, and you get to hear them reacting to how you're taking over their minds, which is pretty cool.\n\nSo I like what they did, generally. That being said, there are some flaws. For one, it would be nice to have more variety in the ships. There are a decent amount to choose from, but a lot of them are just variations on "shoot forward in a straight line." Oh, and another thing, it's always forward. You can't turn around. This is definitely problematic, because the enemies CAN turn around, and they WILL come at you from both sides, and you'll just be, like, well, I can't turn around and shoot the guys behind me, so...bleh. Also, you supposedly have a limited numer of extra lives, but in practice, you get unlimited continues, and continuing puts you at the exact same place as respawning, so...what's the point of having lives, exactly?\n\nIn any case, it's a short game--I'm not very good at shooters and I beat it in 3 hours--so it doesn't wear out its welcome. You don't need to invest much time to enjoy this game. I don't know if it's worth $10, but if you have it in your backlog from some bundle or other, I definitely recommend giving it a look, just because it's interesting and it does something new and unique. It's short, it's sweet, and while it's not the best shooter you've ever played, you've probably never played another shooter like it.\n\nP.S. Make sure to check out the Rock Simulator in the Extras section. It is glorious.","March 13, 2015","true","3.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Or, in some cases, asteroids. While my initial playthrough is short (4.1 hours), there's enough here to make me want to try it again, both mastering the stranger ships' playstyles as well as figuring out the story.\n\nWith all that available to keep the game interesting, it should be mentioned the art style, animations, and soundtrack are all wonderful in themselves. The alien ships tend to have animations that make them immediately recognizable (if the looks weren't enough, that is) from the human ships, making them even more of a joy to jack, but that doesn't mean the human ships don't also have some creative and fun designs and animations to go with them. They very much do, which makes it a tough choice at times to decide between which faction to try to carry through the game with.\n\nThis is only compounded by the differing story perspectives they also each offer, as you get to see each side's perspective in this game in more depth than you ever would in past arcadey games like this. It's a little disorienting at first, but starts to come together towards the end, however I suspect replaying it and trying harder to stick with one side's story might illuminate foggier areas of the story, which makes the length great where it's at. Any longer, and it might feel too tedious to explore the other perspectives in-depth, but as it is? It's great, and I'd definitely recommend it, it's far more than you might expect from a $10 game!","March 13, 2015","true","4.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Once you do that you can fly their ship and use its weapon til ammo runs out (tightly limiting ammo forces you to always be on the lookout for a new ship, you can't find a favourite and just blast everything), or you get blown up.\nIf you jump out of your pilot's mind just before your death blow, you can get in a new mind and keep going if you've aimed/timed the jump properly. It's safer to get a new mind before that point though. Each ship has a different amount of armour, with the lightest crafts taking two hits to be destroyed, so you always have a low armour warning before you explode.\nEach ship has its own unique weapon or playstyle or both, and trying them all was a lot of fun. Also the game is really built around the concept, so some levels and boss fights are really unique to this game and its mechanics. I was very happy with this. Happy is good.\nI just finished the main story mode, and soon will have another go to re-read all the story bits now that I understand what's going on. The story is told in snippets of memories from the pilots you inhabit, and you piece things together as you go. I like that approach, and I think the story is actually pretty cool, but it may take some players more than once to get it.\nThere's also an extras menu that unlocks (I think? That or it's empty at first) after some progression, and as you get further through the game more things are added to it. There's alternate modes, a couple of mini-games, and more. I don't want to spoil the surprise, so I'll just say that one unlock is pretty much the most realistic simulation I've ever played.\n\nSo there you go, my first review. I hope it's helpful to somebody.","July 26, 2015","true","6.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Instead, you control other ships, doing as much damage as you can until you're nearly dead, or out of bullets... then, you just jump out into another ship.\n\nPretty simple, huh? Well, with a decent variety of enemies, it creates some chaotic situations! It also has an interesting way of telling the story, although it's not very accessible for most people (as it requires you noticing it, and then replaying a lot of it).\n\nI'll say right away that I've had a lot of fun with it! I think it's an unique addition to the genre and certainly worth trying out if you like these kind of games.\n\n\n\n\nThere's isn't all that much to say about presentation. It's clearly inspired by the older 8/16bit era, but it's a modernized version of it, with cool visual effects. It manages to stand on its own and not relying purely on nostalgia to look appealing.\nEvery ship is distinguishable, which is needed for the player to know who to control at certain times. One problem I had, at times, is the blending between the bullets and the backgrounds. It didn't happen too often, but I did get killed a few times from bullets I couldn't see.\n\nThe music was actually pretty awesome! It's also very modern sounding chiptunes. It packs a punch! Definitely get the soundtrack if you can, it's awesome, and adds to the whole atmosphere of the game.\n\n\n\nNow, about the game itself, starting with structure.\nYou go through 8 levels, each subdivided into several waves. You have several lives, and you can gain more with combos, but once you deplete them all, you only go back to the beginning of the wave, having the chance to keep going from that point onwards with your score reset to 0.\nThis makes the game forgiving for those who simply want to beat it, leaving the challenge for the score-attack audience, which is a great way of doing things, in my opinion!\nWith that said, it still has a few challenging waves, and the game doesn't save your progress regarding the waves. You need to beat each level in one sitting (which isn't really a problem, since the levels aren't very long). At the end of each level, you'll see your place on the Leaderboards, with the surrounding players.\n\n\n\nIn this case, I want to write about story-telling. Not a very common aspect that I take notice of, especially in an arcade game!\nBut they've done it in an interesting way, so here it is...\n\nThe game has 2 races in war, and you can possess ships from both. At the end of each wave, you'll get a short exposition, from the perspective of the race you're in control of. At the end of the level, the same happens, with a longer exposition.\nThis means that to uncover the whole story of the game, you can't just go head first and shoot everything. It makes you fit the story pieces together, little by little. There are people on the community hub doing this and taking screenshots of the different plot scenes, if you're interested.\n\nWhile this is a confusing way of doing story (and will leave you with barely anything if you don't make an effort to uncover it), it's understandable. In this genre, the story isn't very important. Most players will care about beating the levels, not the backstory. However, if you're not like that, you have a little extra! Not caring doesn't diminish your enjoying of the game, but caring does certainly enhance it, so it's great!\n\n\nFinally, let's talk about the mechanics. There's isn't all that much to say about it, really.\nAs I said before, you can take control of enemy ships, and you can shoot, and move around. That's pretty much it.\nEach ship has very limited ammo, so it constantly keeps you switching around. And each type of ship also has diferent movement/speed, and shooting patterns (some shoot all around, some are stationary turrets, some shoot vertically, some are stuck to the edges/ground, etc.).\nIt's up to the player to evaluate each wave and act accordingly. It's generally not too difficult, with a few exceptions.\n\nThe Boss fights were also a good change of pace, although 2 of them were recycled in a slightly harder version. I won't spoil the last Boss, but I'll say that it was a pretty fun fight!\n\nThe downside (for some) is that going through the campaign once will probably not take you longer than 3 hours. But, in addition to the campaign (that you can easily replay, trying out different ships, piecing the story together, etc.) they also provide extra modes that you unlock through the campaign. One is an Arcade Mode, one is Boss Rush, once is a Rock Simulator (yes, you control a meteorite), an early prototype of the game, a flappy bird clone, and the Credits sequence (yes, you can shoot the developers!).\n\n\n\nSo yeah. If you're into this sort of games, you have my whole-hearted recommendation! I really enjoyed playing through it, and there's certainly more content to keep you entertained, aside from the core campaign.\nReally cool game, well done!","September 7, 2014","true","4.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It isn’t tremendously long – it has 80 stages, including 8 bosses, taking about 4 hours to complete – but it is definitely quite taxing. Unlike many modern games, this game incorporates a lives system and score system, meaning that if you die, you have to start a set of ten stages over again. This can be very unpleasant if you get a game over on a boss.\n\nThe central conceit of Enemy Mind is that you are a mind-hopping parasite who can jump from ship to ship. Each ship has limited ammunition and can take 2-5 shots before going down. Your goal is to use the ships to hop through the battles, taking down all the enemy ships while avoiding being in a ship when it goes down yourself. This leads to fairly unique gameplay, as the ships have a wide variety of attack patterns, both in your hands and in the hands of the AI. This is especially notable in the boss fights, where you must hop around between various ships during the fight to take down the boss without the boss destroying you in the process. Indeed, almost all of the bosses can themselves be mind controlled, resulting in interesting gameplay as you work to destroy the boss while hopping in and out of its body.\n\nThe game has a story underlying it – in-between stages, you can listen to enemy chatter over the coms system, as well as having various memories filter into your mind. While delivered via text, the story is interesting as it reveals more about both the mind-hopping parasite and the world you’re inhabiting, and depending on whether you’re controlling a human ship or an Aratus (alien) ship, you get different story messages (and, at the end of the game, a different ending based on which faction you spent more time mind controlling over the course of the game).\n\nOverall, this is a pretty creative game, and is definitely a distinctive entry within the schmup genre. While the game isn’t mind blowing in terms of quality, it works quite well, and it is fun navigating your way through the game and working out what is going on. That said, it is a schmup game, so if that sort of thing isn’t your cup of tea, or if pixel graphics bother you, this isn’t going to change your mind.\n\nStill, if you’re a fan of the genre, this is worth checking out, even if it is quite difficult; judging by the achievements board and high scores, less than 50 people have beaten this game in its entirety.","March 6","true","6.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

One of the best parts is when you see a new ship and you cant wait to take it over just to see what it shoots like. The couch-coop works great too.

The gameplay is reminicent of the likes of older side scrolling shooter games. I think that Enemy Mind excells at recreating that feeling.

The chiptune soundtrack is catchy.\n\nThe "Enemy Mind" main campaign is quite short and can easily be finished in under 2 hours (it has some additional modes though that provide more to do). Between the levels there are "cut scenes" (text blocks) that tell a story that I personally really didn't care for. The enemy ships look cool and there are many different types to fight and take over.\n\nOn the down side there are no power ups or shield upgrades at all and every ship only has a limited amount of ammunition and shield power. This forces the player to use the game's unique mechanic of taking over other ships.\n\nThere are also some puzzle stages that require you to switch vessels very strategically. Boss fights are very fun and challenging. Generally the difficulty level is low, so this is nothing for hardcore bullet hell players.\n\nI really enjoyed the game and can recommend it.

I picked this game up in a Humble Bundle based on the rest of the games in the bundle. I had seen a recommendation about this game previously from a YouTube channel called "Extra Credits." This means that I at least knew what to expect.\n\nWhat I did not expect was that I would actually have fun playing this game! I mainly played it just to get the Steam cards. However, I'm definitely going to go back and complete the game sometime in the near future.\n\nIf I have a gripe, it's that the game is very likely a short one. There seems to be 8 levels and just getting the 3 card drops I managed to make it to Level 4. However, I'd definitely recommend picking this up if you see it for a reasonable price.","June 15, 2015","true","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Mainly thanks to its main gimmick.\n\nPROS\n-You can play with a friend in co-op on the couch\n-Yes, you can literally steal any ship and use it, even bosses! That's petty awesome!\n-Pixel-art sprites, backgrounds and projectiles are all great\n-Sound and music are okay, but nothing to write home about\n-Has a clever way of telling the story from the side of the humans, or aliens, depending on the type of ship you finish a level as. This adds some replayability.\n-Is pretty challenging but fair\n\nCONS\n-Has a pretty limited repertoire of ships to steal\n-You'll only be facing two factions for most of the game - humans and aliens\n-Ships are both fragile and with limited ammo, so you won't be able to hang on to a certain favorite ship\n-Once the gimmick has become stale, it really is just a bland shooter\n-Story is pretty much irrelevant. You'll read it and go "who cares"?\n\nAll in all, a very solid shoot 'em up with a unique mechanic you won't find anywhere else.\n\nHighly recommend, especially if you've got a friend that can join you in co-op.","May 21, 2015","true","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The hitch is that one of those buttons allows you to hop your control to an enemy ship.\n\nGameplay hinges around the gimmick, and it's a good one, but what puts this title from pleasantly retro to a must-buy in my mind is its narrative.\n\nEnemy Mind has absolutely no reason to have a story as good as it does.\n\nThe writing explores in full the wonder and horror of being a thing that slips from consciousness to consciousness, consuming and casting away bodies like shell casings out of nothing more than curiosity. Plot snippets are brief and frequent, and vary depending on which of the two factions' ships you end a sub-stage with. I found myself playing with as much as sense of horror as with retro glee, and out of everything else Enemy Mind gave me as an experience, that's what surprised me the most.\n\nI'd impulse-buy this at 2.50 and regular-buy it at 5.00 or 6.00. It's fairly short--maybe a couple hours long, without major replayability--but just a single run-through leaves an impression strong enough to change your day.","January 25, 2015","true","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I don't really feel drawn to replay it or climb leaderboards.\n\nOverall, it's kinda fun, but it's just not fun enough to recommend (compared to the plethora of other, more fun games you could be playing).\n\nAs a shooter/SHMUP, it just feels weak. This feeling of weakness comes from everything from the music and sound to the gameplay mechanics and art.\n\nYour gun and the enemy guns shoot tiny bullets that just go "pew pew". You can't spam your shots either - you have limited ammo with each ship so you'll find the gameplay consisting of making tiny adjustments, trying to line up with an enemy ship, and tapping once only to hear a pathetic "pew" and weak "retro" explosion sound effect. The hitboxes don't match up with the enemy sprites at all - the actual hitbox for an enemy is usually smaller than the actual sprite, which makes it even more frustrating to try to line up shots.\n\nThe music is just as tinny and weak sounding as the sound effects. It's actually fine that it blends in with the whole soundscape of the game, but overall I just found it to be entirely forgettable and not add to the game at all.\n\nFurthermore, and this is probably the most detrimental to the core gameplay: the art lacks hard edges/contrast and makes it difficult to tell what is going on. When there's a lot of stuff on the screen, it becomes a huge cluster of nonsense and makes it very difficult to parse the game state and keep track of yourself. A simple addition of a few visual cues, some nice hard outlines for the enemies or something like that would've done loads to enable more satisfying, skillful play. They did a great job of making the enemy types easy to distinguish so I'm surprised that the devs didn't consider this sort of issue.\n\nThere's also several other frustrating bits. Things like the enemies being able to turn around when they get behind you and shoot you. It's just not very fun to deal with.\n\nAt times, however, this game does manage to be quite fun when you're successfully stringing together several jumps and taking out lots of enemies as you go. These moments are few and far between, but I imagine if you played it more and got more skillful you would experience this more often. Also, the challenging parts of this game are quite rewarding when you finally beat them. They also avoided making it too frustrating by letting you continue from the wave you were on even when you lose all of your lives (though your score is reset).\n\nThe story is quite cryptic and so sparsely told throughout the game that I had a hard time following it.\n\nIn conclusion, just contrast this with the feel of playing something like Raiden where you're making tiny corrections to dodge through swarms of bullets, all the while firing away with an upgradeable massive weapon, wreaking havoc on the enemy and causing explosions everywhere while a rad soundtrack plays. That's partially one of the things that makes those games fun to play - the amount of polish that went into evoking a feeling of power and intensity. This game just doesn't evoke that feeling, and maybe it didn't intend to, but it just doesn't FEEL fun.\n\nIf you're just looking for something new and like climbing leaderboards and raising your high score, you might enjoy this, but why not play a more thrilling game?","November 3, 2014","false","2.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

It even has 16-bit graphics and sounds, so it's even more deceptive to write it off as "just another shooter" before you try it.\n\nBut there is one very important twist in play: you don't have a ship. Instead, you're some sort of psychich entity that can claim control of nearby ships. This is interesting in different levels:\n-a variety of weapons. Each enemy can be braincontrolled (if you aim that braincontrolling option correctly), and each ship handles differently.\n-variety in play style. As each ship has limited armor and ammo, you NEED to change ships every so often.\n-ties in with the plot seemlessly over the course of 80 levels.\n\nThe story deserves credit as well. I generally don't play this sort of game for the story, but it managed to capture me nonetheless. And that's remarkable, seeing how it's "just" shooting enemies. I won't say I get all the details between the humans, the artarus (squids) and the overseer, but...it's certainly miles above the average for shooters. :-)\n\nI'm actually amazed I only played this game for 3 hours. Sure, the levels are short and things can get repetitive outside the boss fights (which are awesome!), but this is the sort of a-few-hours game.\n\nSo all in all: I recommend it. :-)","October 11, 2014","true","3.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I like how simple the controls are so you focus more on play than style. The style comes from the unique gameplay design. You can take over your enemy. You have limited amount of ammo per ship. and once you are out of ammo or want an upgrade you jst take over their ship.  There are more clever ways they use this in the game as well but I don't want to give out any spoilers.

Taking over enemy ships and using them might  seem like a simple thing, but each one has a different amount of HP, ammo, speed, damage and bullet type, you can't keep a single ship for a long time because you'll eventually run out of ammo, and the constant bulletstorm will have you on your toes positioning your current ship on the field, thinking which will be your next move.\n\nYour "switching beam" has a limited range and you can't spam it, some ships have limited mobility, some won't move at all, some can't turn left and some might even self-destruct, it's a unique and satisfying challenge, might be difficulty but it's not unfair at all.\n\nOn top of that the way it tells the story was very interesting, the game gives you only minimalistic details and provides glaces at the memories of the ships you've taken over, but different factions have different sights of what happened during the conflict and different ways of speaking (since they're different species).\n\n\nIn any case, I'd recommend this game for both it's gameplay and story.

It's very curious because you CAN BE the enemy and THE BOSSES, but of course is not that simple. You start with an average battle ship and you have few ammo and medium health (one single enemy hit is considered a health bar in less). So you have to be careful by not wasting ammo and whenever you want you can launch a short range spell that if successfully hit the enemy, you will steal its ship (if you steal a new shuttle while yours has no ammo, the old one will be destroyed, otherwise it will still be alive) :D By the way, if you are lazy like me to aim carefully your hits, you can just spam your entire weapon and immediately steal an enemy ship and so on.\nThe retro style is very cool, the gameplay simple and effective, and the ships (indeed with their various weapons) are awesome.\nVery good game to play anytime!\nPs: I'm not that rich so i wouldn't pay 10 Eur for this game, i would wait for any sale :P\n\n[ITA] Un divertente ("divertente"... ti fa rosicare quando crepi) e un diverso dal solito retro shooter game con la classica navicella. E' molto curioso perchè PUOI ESSERE il nemico e I BOSS, ma non è così semplice. Si inizia con una navicella standard con qualche munizione e un pò di hp (un colpo nemico è considerato una barra vita in meno). Quindi bisogna prestare attenzione a non sprecare tutte le munizioni e quando si vuole si può lanciare una spell a corto raggio che se riesce a colpire un nemico vi impossesserete di lui (se si impossessa una navicella nemica mentre la vostra è senza munizioni quella senza munizioni verrà distrutta, altrimenti vi ritroverete la vostra vecchia navicella come nemica ancora in vita). :D Comunque, se siete pigri come me e non volete concentrarvi a mirare bene il nemico, potete spammare i vostri colpi e rubare subito una navicella nemica e così via.\nLo stile retro è molto carino, il gameplay semplice ed efficace, e le navicelle (e tutte le varie armi) sono fantastiche.\nUn bel gioco da giocare quando si vuole!\nPs: Non sono così ricco da voler spendere 10 Euro per questo gioco, io aspetterei un saldo! :P","December 12, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a fun little game that adresses most the things he talks about in his book. However not all of the design choices in the game translate to the teaching of the book which is rather disappointing. It's still a great game though. If you like shmups check this one out.","March 16","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are easy, the fun is huge.\n\nEvery ship has limited ammo and you HAVE to posses ships very often. That's where the fun begin, as it brings a lot of strategy beyond the shooting.\n\nIf you possess another ship before you are out of ammo - the old "You" start shooting you from point blank.\nIf you jump from fast to slow ship in straight line - you'll get the collision damage with your old one and you'll be one hit from death.\nIf your old slow ship runs out after you cleaned all but the fastest ships - you'll gonna have bad time getting them.\n\nIt takes precision, calculation and holding fire to master it, as shooting all the time will render you naked to the incoming wave. So you kinda need to clear all but the ship you want, spending all the ammo you have and posses it without killing it first.\n\nYeah, all that on top of the very classic "shootings everywhere" game. Not sure about the story tho, I just skip everything so I can shoot again :D\n\n10/10 will posses the worst ship possible again!","December 30, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Where you have to shoot your way through many spaceships, gain more points and when you're running out of health through the hull's health, you can move to another spaceship and carry on. What makes the game harder is the three lives system in which where you die after three tries, you have to start all over again\n\nThe game is fun but challenging, it can get boring for some people after a while.

Definitely would have been worth paying 10$ for.\n\nFirst couple of levels I was thinking "Oh, this is a fun little take on Gradius style space shooters, but not overly complex or challenging". Then I got to level 3 and suddenly the game made me take back that statement. The ship switching mechanic becomes very important for navigating each level, knowing when to switch and to which target is what keeps you alive. Each ship is easy to learn to control and vastly diffrent from the others in both how they move and fire, and I've yet to find one I didn't have a use for at one point. Though several I found myself jumping to briefly, taking out targets from their angle, then jumping again before I got stuck.\n\nGraphics are sprite based and feel like something out of the SNES era, sound is on a simlar style and quality. Maybe not the best digital synthysizer music I've heard but very effective for the setting. The story I'm still getting into but it's revealed to you in short bits between waves and levels. Minor hints here in there as to why you're a conciousness jumping from ship to ship, and why there's a war between humans and an alien race going on around you. The pacing of the story is just enough to get you hooked and never slows down the action.\n\nThe game also has amusing extras that unlock at each level. The first one for example is "Flappity Mind" which allows you to play effectively a version of Flappy Bird. The others seem similarly ridiculous, but worth it for a few laughs.\n\nSo yes. Get this game, Even at full price. You'll have fun blowing stuff up and being the mysterious force making everyone afraid of who's going to turn on them next.","December 19, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Taking over enemy ships and using them might  seem like a simple thing, but each one has a different amount of HP, ammo, speed, damage and bullet type, you can't keep a single ship for a long time because you'll eventually run out of ammo, and the constant bulletstorm will have you on your toes positioning your current ship on the field, thinking which will be your next move.\n\nYour "switching beam" has a limited range and you can't spam it, some ships have limited mobility, some won't move at all, some can't turn left and some might even self-destruct, it's a unique and satisfying challenge, might be difficulty but it's not unfair at all.\n\nOn top of that the way it tells the story was very interesting, the game gives you only minimalistic details and provides glaces at the memories of the ships you've taken over, but different factions have different sights of what happened during the conflict and different ways of speaking (since they're different species).\n\n\nIn any case, I'd recommend this game for both it's gameplay and story. The price it's a little high for it's length, but I believe the quality greatily compensates for it.","December 18, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Jump between ships, expend all a ship's ammo, ram it into another ship and jump just before it explodes. It also has some great scoring rules - kill ships to build up a multiplier, and it'll pulse a blast disabling other ships in the area so you can jump into them at your convinience.\nstarts out slow but hits a nice difficulty curve. plus there's a minimal story that is pretty well told.","February 13","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lacks a bit in difficulty, but very engaging.\n\nWhat text there is is very well written, and in simple, non-expository ways explores the player's position of causing, and being caught between conflict with unknown entities.\n\nVisual design is simple but effective and impactful. Ship designs are unique enough to force slight changes in gameplay without becoming overwhelming.\n\nSound design is lacking, I think. Doesn't fit with the simple but deep visuals and mechanics of the game.","February 10","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has various levels accompanied by a short yet complex story and some additional challenges. I like it and it´s a good game if you want to chill out and take your MIND off a little. The downside is that it has some bugs like the game suddenly freezes and that may cause some achievements to be very difficult to get. If you can look past that then I recommend this game.","May 28","true","29.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
