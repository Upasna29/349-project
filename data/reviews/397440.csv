Voice overs are good and soundtrack too. The graphics are a bit pixlated at full screen for those using a wide screen monitor.\n\nThis is an older game and truthfully the price is a bit steep. It does include a travel map and location hints and a bonus chapter however.","October 22, 2015","true","2.3"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

It was about the 6-in-1 Bundle from Alawar, with the excellent Mexicana: Deadly Holidays and the fact that for once, the action was set during a Mexican celebration. Well, the life is weird because I've played Lost Legends: The Weeping Woman without even knowing the plot and I ended up with a legend from San Cristobal, with a celebration where you see also skulls masks and other accessories around deaths.\n\nThe Weeping Woman is a woman that lost her husband and her children to another girl and that drowned herself in the river nearby. Children were disappearing, so the villagers created a celebration to appease the sad spirit. However, while it was calm for years, now, drama is happening around. You're sent to San Cristobal as a reporter, however, you'll be thrown into a kid's disappearance... Is it really the Weeping Woman?\n\nThe plot is well-done: while you're doubting that it's the spirit behind the disappearances, the truth was shocking in the end. I loved the fact that it sets during a celebration and that you have such mysteries around a legend. You're even visiting ruins at the end, changing from the little village and from the country.\n\nWhile the gameplay is the same as any of the hidden object games here, I found the scenes very easy and the puzzles not very complicated, even if some can be seen as hard as it needs some logic that usually fails me. However, you don't have the instructions at first sight, to know what you need to do, you have to click on a button. I don't like usually not being told first about the rules.\n\nGiven the fact that the game is a collector's edition, you can find a bonus chapter: San Cristobal needs you because of another legend: El Sombreron is enchanting girls that fall into a coma after having their hair being braided. You'll also find concept arts, wallpapers, etc...\n\nI loved the graphics. I loved that little village and the atmosphere typically in full celebration mode. I also liked a lot the passage in the ruins. As for the soundtrack, it was very well fitting.\n\nLost Legends: The Weeping Woman is a nice casual games, that will enjoy any hardcore gamer or newbie in the genre, so, it's a good purchase, though I would wait for a price drop or for a discount.","March 28","true","3.5"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

This Hidden Object game takes the player in a little town where the people live in fear of a ghost that every year kidnaps a child, there's even a short bonus chapter and other extras, achievements are in-game only not on Steam. Graphics are very good and there are several locations but the puzzles and the HO scenes are very easy even at the highest difficulty. It's an enjoyable game and I recommend it to both experts and beginners.","March 21","true","3.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The art style is really lovely to look at. I also appreciated some new takes on traditional Hidden Object Games which made this game really enjoyable and for me kept it from being boring. I found the story interesting and I always appreciate a good mystery. I would defintely recommend. Especially if you can find this game in a bundle.","May 15","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You get to travel to different locations and buy this on special as the price it is at normal rate is quite steep and will take a few hours to 5 hours depending on how long it takes to solve puzzles and if you use hint button. I liked the music and graphics and you will be surprised who is behind everything sort of like in the Scooby Doo cartoon and a nice game to play with children.","May 29","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
