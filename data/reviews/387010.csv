The problem is the game starts you out facing enemies that do not drop loot. It seems in Five the enemies that drop loot most of the time are what you might call "Elites". These are enemies that have at least 1 Star under their health bar. Some enemies will have more than one star indicating they are higher rank and they will drop more and better loot.\n\nHonestly Five has more in common with Marvel Heroes Online than any thing else I can think of. Five is more about skills much like MHO. Also some have complained that they don't get to put points into their individual stats on level up, which is true, but Five is more about farming loot that has the stat bonuses you want and fine tuning your character that way, which honestly has more impact than dropping 5 points into various stats each level up.\n\nI highly encourage others to play through to Act 3 and possibly a little further before posting your review. Once you have access to Zion things get much more interesting, plus you can use the map to go back and play previous chapters and even farm bosses.\n\nIn fact  I just finished replaying the chapter where you fight Goliath and got myself a brand spankin' new Goliath Spear that has different stats than the first one I got, plus the stats are better as in Five when loot drops it drops around your level, enemies also seem to get buffed when you go back through area's as well, which keeps things a little more challenging.\n\nI have really enjoyed the comic book cut scenes and voice overs as well. Very good and informative stuff.\n\nAll the Biblical and Historical information the game gives you along the way comes in handy when you get access to Zion as there is a Quiz Podeum thing where it tests your knowledge through the different chapters of the game and then you are granted loot based on how well you did. It is not a new thing, but it is nice to see it in the game.\n\nAlso if there are features you want to see added be sure to post  in the forums as Chris will usually respond and pass suggestions on to the Dev Team.\n\nAll in all, after several hours of play I would give Five a solid 7.5/10. It's a good ARPG for the money and is better than some of the other Diablo clones on Steam. There are still some improvements and features that could be added and I hope the Dev's will listen to fans and add those features in the future.","November 25, 2015","true","23.4"," 74 of 87 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","74","87","0","3"

I say "based" as its clear when they invent a character or place. It doesn't preach, and doesn't require you to know the bible to enjoy this.\n\nBut Bible aside this game doesn't suffer for its Bible trappings. I'm a sucker for games that use any source material well and moreso when they enrich your own knowlage or lack thereof the materal in the game. Crusader Kings II has their wikipedia links when they use actual people and Five Guardians of David does as well by having Caches hidden throught the level to collect and with it comes a bit of directors commentary as to where you are sits in the bible or where they chose to embellish, even has the passage they took it from.\n\nSo now that I have said that the Bible setting of the game doesn't interfere with the game by being "preachy" I have slain that 500 pound gorrila and can move on to the game itself.\n\nIts an action rpg with the standards of a action bar that fills as you level up and a equipment that you earn to increase your stats with. Being paired up with other controlable npcs allows for you to have choices in how you want to fight such as be melee or ranged.  It also helps the story along as your charcter doesnt talk alound to himself for exposition. This is the Bible so yes there is plenty of bossfights and they come with decent set pieces and a solid challenge. David can get stumped by Goliath.\n\nProductionwise the game's artists and programmers must be commended for making a setting aproprate to the era. Good sound design and suprising voice work helps move a simple story.  The music sets the mood and the games cinematics do a good job of setting the plot and location well.\n\nMy only complaints so far is the "comic book cutscenes" could be handled better and be a better resolution. And AI partners love to ignore a beating you are taking if its more than 5 feet away,  There is a few crashes when I mess with the shadow settings as well.\n\nOverall if you want a fun arpg, moreso one thats set in the Bible, this stands alone but it stands strong.","December 1, 2015","true","9.8"," 54 of 62 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","54","62","0","2"

From getting into the story, characters, voice acting and challenges that the game throws at you it's really a fun ARPG.\n\nYes, it has some minor issues here and there but I'm sure they will get fixed with patches (like your party standing around not attacking or the game loading sometimes without sound, but that last one could have been my own laptop's issuse, not sure).\n\nI highly recommend this game for ARPG fans, and for Christians, this is the game that you've been waiting for and complaining that didn't exist....","December 9, 2015","true","7.3"," 37 of 48 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","37","48","3","0"

Instead, I have been pleasantly surprised by the depth and scope of the story provided. Not only has it kept me interested, but by sprinkling in excerpts from the Bible, the game provides background to the story unfolding before you.\n\nGameplay wise it plays very much like Diablo/PoE. FIVE changes this up a bit however by providing you with a choice of characters that stay grouped with you, allowing the player to switch between them at will. This lets you change your playstyle up to suit the situation, whether it be ranged or close quarter combat.\n\nLastly, chapters are punctuated with some fantastic artwork in a comic book style that moves the story along at a great pace.\n\nHighlight so far:\n-The battle between David and Goliath.\n-Art Work\n-Plays Smoothly, very few dramas with bugs so far.\n\nNegatives:\n-Lack of mob variety early on, wolves, wolves and more wolves.\n-Pacing of abilities gained\n-The voice acting is a mixed bag, some is great it but can be quite jarring to hear a thick accent in conversation with an american one.\n\nVerdict: Will continue playing, enjoying the story and the familiar gameplay as a Diablo fan.  Good value for money buy if you're looking for a game thats easy to get into and you enjoy the hack/slash genre.","December 14, 2015","true","1.7"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

It's story is mostly based on the Bible stories, so you found yourself at ancient lands of Canaan in David's era . The story enough interesting and well confirmed, also the cut scenes looks very good, its confirmed in comic style. The control is enough simple and good, if you played before same style games its should be similar to you. The graphic looks good, sounds and music also good, all this do a game even more enjoyable.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+good music and sounds\n+nice comic cut scenes\n+enough interesting story\n+steam achievements and cards\n+interesting boss battles (for example Goliath)\n\n-some bugs\n-a bit high price\n\nThis game I think really enjoyable.

On one hand we have the interesting idea of pairing Biblical stories to a video game, an action RPG at that, yet does the medium of the story add anything to the experience? FIVE: Guardians of David feels like it’s a little lost at what it wants to be, we have a linear, mostly-unaltered story, and on the over side we have a Diablo-esque ARPG with loot, tonnes of skills with a group play twist.\n\nThe story itself is well told through the use of voice acting, comic book style cutscenes and cache’s, which are a little like developer notes with reference to the bible passages. If you ever did Bible studies in school you’ll be able to know where these stories are and what the references in the game are. Without that knowledge though it may feel very disjointed, and while the game does a good job at filling in all the blanks, the story isn’t in-depth enough where you’ll be able to gain a full experience. Overall I think the story serves its purpose, but it really does depend if you’re interested in the laid out story.\n\nNow as we move onto gameplay this is where a lot of questions start to arise. As a massive ARPG junkie there are a couple of things that need to be on point in order for a satisfying experience; responsiveness, impact and loot, which ‘FIVE’ fails to truly reach. The game is clunky at the best of times, actions feel unresponsive and even simple things such as targeting enemies can become a drag, it’s also bogged down by the less than stellar AI for enemies and your allies. The impact of your actions seem so watered down to keep it historically accurate, ground pounds and leaping kicks should feel amazing and enjoyable to do, yet a lot of the time they look like they could be caked into a normal auto attack. Loot is a big problem, the game doesn’t allow you to backtrack, which is something major in ARPG titles(aka the grind), to alleviate this the game hands you loot on major ‘boss’ kills and the ending of a mission. The removal of a RNG based loot system means your upgrades are set in stone and you don’t get that awesome feeling of gaining new loot, the stats themselves are uninteresting and don’t allow for much customisation.\n\nI feel the game tries to bite off more than it can chew which leaves it feeling unpolished and lacklustre. While I did enjoy my time with the game I couldn’t see myself going much further, sure the story is there, but when your game promises ‘action’ it really needs to deliver, especially with so many over alternatives on offer. I’d love to see a pseudo-sequel of this game, allowing the developers to improve on what they’ve already built, which in my opinion would make this a great game to pick up. It’s good to see some innovation by mixing the two ideas, but maybe they need to refine what the games goals are. What does the loot bring? Does every character need 18 skills for a 6 slot hotbar?  Is controlling 5 characters too many?","November 24, 2015","false","8.3"," 49 of 78 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","49","78","5","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ccgr/recommended/387010/","ccgr","gwenavirre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ccgr/","345 products in account","Thank you Kingdom Games for sending us this game to review!\n\nKing David was described in the Bible numerous times (1 Sam 13:14, Acts 13:22) as a man after God’s own heart.  He was also a warrior and shed a lot of blood (1 Chronicles 28:3) and because of that, the job of building a temple for God was passed onto his son, Solomon.  David wasn’t the only one on the battlefield though - he had many mighty warriors and they are all described in 2 Samuel 23:8-39. FIVE: Guardians of David focuses on Jashobeam, Eleazar, Shammah, Abishai, and Benaiah.\n\nEach of these warriors has a specialized weapon and together they were an unstoppable force that have wiped out many of Israel’s enemies including the Amalekites, Arameans, Edomites, Jebusites, Moabites, and the Philistines.    In the beginning of the game, these mighty men were mere shepherd boys fighting off wolves along with the occasional lion.\nFIVE: Guardians of David is an action RPG very similar to the play style of Diablo.  The swarms of enemy soldiers can be attacked by clicking on them repeatedly or by holding down the mouse pointer on them until their hit points are depleted.  As long as another mighty warrior is still standing, you can take control of them at any time.  If one of the warriors falls in battle, the others can pick up their slack if needed.  If all of the warriors fall, the game will resume at the nearest check point and the enemy’s health points will be where you left them.  Some gamers may find that too easy for their tastes, especially during boss battles. There are many boss battles and of course, the epic battle between David and Goliath takes place early on in the game.\n\nA majority of the game takes place as David is fleeing from Saul and beginning to establish his kingdom.  Besides dealing with outside opposition, the people of Jerusalem did not want him to establish his kingdom there.   Their king had to take it by force, and he did.\n\nWhile most of the game is based on and sources its Biblical references, there are some added characters and story elements to keep things interesting.     In total there are eleven acts and forty-two levels in the single-player campaign.  After completing each act and their boss, a Steam achievement is earned.  I’m not sure why, but there is no achievement or mention of Act 3.  Does that mean there are only ten acts?  In either case, this is one of three Steam games I have gotten a 100% completion on.\n\nThere’s a decent amount of variety in the game’s missions.  Besides beating the snot out of people, you will also have many opportunities to set fires to their camps or scout them out stealth style while not being detected.  Animal lovers may take offense to the mission objectives that require hobbling messenger horses (binding their legs with rope) or setting loose pigs with ignited jars of oil on them to set enemy tents ablaze in the chaos.  Each mission has several objectives that need to be completed and optional caches that can be found to relay some story background and accompanying Biblical verses.  Finding all of the caches is great for OCD gamers and their knowledge will prove to be useful when it comes to taking quizzes in exchange for some good loot.  I like the way that this game offers but doesn’t force Biblical references on the gamers and they can to choose to read it if they want to.\n\nIn all honesty, FIVE: Guardians of David is one of the better Bible themed games I have played in a long time.  The gameplay is fun and just when it starts to get a little bit dull, something new is thrown into the mix like stealth missions or enemies with new abilities.  The alchemists were very annoying with their fire attacks and explosions upon their death.\n\nThere’s a fair amount of humor as well with the conversations amongst the five mighty warriors turning into bickering and they pick on and prank each other a bit throughout the game.  The voice acting is well done and the background music is a good fit, though it could use a little more variety in my opinion.\n\nGraphically, FIVE: Guardians of David is pretty good and there’s a decent amount of variety in the maps.  Some of the missions take place in towns while others are in the desert or inside of caves.  The enemy animations are nicely done as well though I did run into a funny glitch.  During a battle instead of the enemies attacking me, they were clapping instead.  It was both hilarious and taunting as if to say the attacks weren’t powerful enough.  Once that swarm of enemies was defeated, the normal attack animations resumed.\n\nSadly, I wish that was the only glitch I had to report.  The check points in this game is arguably useful.  While they do record your inventory and number of caches discovered, if you have to leave your game mid-level for any reason, upon re-launching it you’ll have to start at the beginning of the level again.  The only time the check points work properly is if you get defeated by a boss, and sadly even then they don’t trigger properly.  I got my butt kicked in two different boss fights and my party was not registering in the game as dead and when I had to reload the autosave, I had to start the level from the beginning and re-do all of the objectives before I could fight the boss again.\n\nDespite having to redo my progress a couple of times, my experience playing FIVE: Guardians of David has been mostly positive.  The single-player campaign took me roughly seventeen hours to complete.  There is some re-playability if anyone missed locating all of the caches during their first play-through.  This game lends itself well to multiplayer-coop but it’s not available at this time.  The developers haven’t excluded the possibility.  While the normal price is $24.99, I have seen it for less than $10 on sale and it’s worth picking up if you’re looking for a good Bible themed game.  I look forward to future releases from Kingdom Games.","March 2","true","17.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

Never thought I would see a game like this that was this good.\n\nPros- The art design is great, audio and music excellent.\nCombat can be as fun or as boring as you make it. Plenty of skills and tactics to make things interesting. For me it was fun, slamming enemies into the ground-kicking them across the screen, though it would be simple enough to just click through the levels boringly.\nTons of loot, varying styles of armor and weapons keep things interesting and item stats help to shape character builds.\nThe Old Testament setting is my favorite aspect of the game to be honest.\n\nCons- Biggest would be bugs. Haven't hit to many, but they are there. But then again I have seen some pretty massive AAA games with more bugs (Here is looking at you Fallout 4).\nI would like more interesting things to buy with my Shekels, I am fairly far in and haven't seen anything worth buying. Just been donating to the beggars...\nCombat skills are hit and miss. There are some really cool ones, but I think they needed more balancing. One skill in a tier can be far more powerful that another skill for no apparent reason whatsoever. Plenty of good ones to choose from though.\n\nSummary- If you like ARPGs and want a unique setting, its an easy sell. Also if you have any interest in the Bible and Old Testament times, I highly recommend.\nIf you are wanting the next big thing this may not be it. Also, while the game is definitely not preachy it is about the Bible. So if you have no interest in that it may not be for you.\nSo basically, as an ARPG game it has a good many merits and some flaws.

Beautiful environments loosely based on ancient Canaan.\n3. Tons of loot including fantasy interpretations of ancient Near East clothing, weapons, and armor.

Some audio bugs like missing audio and overlapping music.\n5. I was able to complete one level's objectives out of order making it unbeatable and requiring me to restart the level.\n6. Inconsistent dialogue and narration writing ranging from good to poor.\n7. No consequences for dying.\n8. Using the best gear and upgrading abilities quickly make characters super-double-extra-OP. (But you don't have to use good gear or assign ability points if you don't want to.)\n\nSo, go buy it, just use the loot that makes your character look cool, set some warpigs on fire, smash Philistines with your skull hammer, ignore the caches and instead read the Lion of War series, some good history/archaeology texts and, of course, the Bible itself.

Good for beginner/novice players to RPGs. As far as history is concerned the game does try to remain as close to the Bible as it can without straying away, it provides plenty of scripture verses and if something doesn't quite fit there is usually a world object called a "cache" that will provide audio dialog explaining it (i.e the character Ariella). What I really liked about this game though was the dialog and fully voiced comic strips. Would love to have access to those outside the game. Also there's no blood or gore in this game as far as I can see which is also a plus.

I experience some FPS issues, for sure. Saving isn't the best, but it's straightforward that you need to save at the start of levels (i.e. finish the one you're on before you quit playing). The inventory and outfit customizations are deep and well designed. The art (scenery, wardrobes, weapons, enemies, etc.) are all *very* enjoyable to me and most of all, I am very happy to finally have a decent game to play that is mainly focused on Bible themes. The fact that many of the bosses are GIANTS is totally awesome IMO as well ! I think most of the people who have reviewed this poorly have not played through it very much or already have a favorite game in this style that they hold this up to (perhaps even one based on the lord of terror rather than The Lord ? :o lol). Once you get to Act 3 the locations that open up offer more chances to divest your inventory, save, etc.\n\nI was mainly excited to play this because of the subject matter and historical period and I am not disappointed. From smashing Fish-man idols to wearing antlers and capes; there is a primal feel to the whole game that permeates the first few chapters like nothing I've ever played before. It's like, if you ever played AOE or something and just wanted to be the nomad for a while - but I digress. Seeing renditions of Jerusalem (then running around it) when it was only a 15 acre walled settlement was really interesting to me too.\n\nI would say it could use some polish in a few areas and I will be happy to make a post in the forums once I do some more evaluation. Still, I decided to buy this at full price because I really wanted to support the developers vision and, again, I am not disappointed.\n\nIf they do another patch at some point and just tidy it a bit, without changing anything that they really have here already - this would be an easy 8 or 8.5 for me. Maybe more. I certainly look forward to the next title from this dev. Keep att'er and good work !!\n\n7.5/10 (+1)\n\nIf you can get it on sale, or are really looking for a game with this theme already then I would still give it an 8+. The only thing that very modern gamers might pooo-pooo is that the cut-scenes are all 'comic book style' but they are well done and there is adequade voice acting throughout. Some of it is really good but other parts are more satisfactory to the role. All in all, I don't see why anyone wouldn't like this title - especially if the FPS can be improved someday via another optimization patch or a guide. (maybe i should poke around and see if there's more on it in the forums, etc still too :P )\n\nRecommend ? Yep.\n\nHeads up - known FPS issues, needs a bit of polishing but generally a good game on it's own merits. I would say these devs are worth keeping an eye on if this is an early product. Tons of good games happening in Texas lately, this is another very worthy offering in the Lone Star State's stable.","April 17","true","34.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It gives some additional deepness to the game and the story. I recommend to read them, they are not soo long.\n-graphics is nice\n-family-friendly. Not like in case of a lot of other RPGs nowadays, you do not have to be necrophil to enjoy this game, there are no too detailed rotten bodies, narrow crypts, etc.\n\nMinus:\n-SPOILER:  Why do not I have a sling to defeate Goliath?! I was searching it for 5 minutes, meantime of course it killed me!\n-very buggy or just bad game desing regarding the save/load system: it saves only the map where you are and only those loots what you gathered on the previous maps although the game let you save anywhere. So if you save at the end of a map you lose the progress on it including items. So always save at the begining on the maps.\n-the checkpoint system totaly spoils the challenge: at the first try a boss killed me but I knew that I will be able to kill it for a second try. But this stupid chechpoint system resigned me and I was able to kill the boss by one blow since its hp remained almost zero not like mine. It was not satisfactory at all to kill it on this way, I felt that I am a cheater...\n-although the graphics is nice but there is a design issue like at many other games nowadays: It is too 'shiny' so it hurts the eye, difficult to recognize what are on the ground since it radiates. I do not know what is the name of this effect something bloom or whatever but you can not switch it off in the game, maybe from driver.\n\nOverall I would recommend it for now due to the story and environment and the fact that it is finally not just a copy of other RPGs but something interesting and new, but I will play the game more and later mybe I'll update this review.\n\nUPDATE:\nAfter more test it turned out that the save issue is even worse than I described above: sometimes you lose even the progress on the previous map. So I change this review to not recommended until fixing of this bug is confirmed. :-(","January 2","false","2.4"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

Regardless of the weapon similarities, each character is unique and has a certain role. Beneniah is great for big single targets, Jashobeam will wreck hordes of lower level enemies, and Eleazer is quite tanky and has an AoE stun. The Goliath fight is peculiar given the source material, but watching a giant do a spear charge into a crowd and seeing the spectators fly through the air makes up for it. The control schene is certailny odd, but it is easily understood. If I had one thing I would change about the game, it is a shop tutorial.

The story of David is at the center of attention right from the start, most of it depicted through comic-book style cut-scenes between the missions and the rest through scarce dialogue encounters in the game.\n\nMost of the time when you actually bother to pay attention to what the game has to say you get the impression that you are listening to some kind of a weird Biblical teaching device. Characters are paradoxically soulless, and despite being some of the most important Biblical figures, they have no personality whatsoever. Representation of that storyline onto the battlefield is even worse. Missions you venture through will give you absolutely no sense of accomplishment as you literary won’t die. Even if you do, you will simply take control of some other character from your party of five. Atop of that almost every single mission objective in the game is a boring fetch quest where you must either destroy, collect, grab or pull something, killing hundreds along the way.\n\nThe player controls a party up to a 5 class-based characters: ranged weapon users, spear wielders, sword and shield fighters. There is plenty of space for quite a number of collectible gear and weapons on the shoulders of five men you control, which unfortunately makes no difference due to the fact that such a casual combat doesn’t require you to even bother with comparing or even collecting new gear. You slice through hordes of enemies like knife through butter any give weapon.\n\nThere is no deapth or high quality here, not by any means a Diablo–style action RPG clone. FIVE: Guardians of David is simply a below average game for a below average player. On the other side FIVE being a “Bible Game,” doesn’t bring much of anything to the table other than slaying people by thousands, while promoting some kind of twisted morality through the comic-book cutscenes. Levels are entirely linear and narrow corridors, with some kind of and open space usually associated to a boss battle (which you can’t lose, as you respawn over and over again). Leveling-up is done collectively by group and new abilities are auto-assigned by the game, though these can be modified.\n\nI really cannot reccommend FIVE to anyone. Fans of action RPGs have literally dozens of better games to choose from. Price of 22,99$ is ridiculous for the content you get. Aside from the novelty of the Biblical theme and story, FIVE‘s gameplay ignores a lot of what has been a standard in the genre for quite some time. Such important gameplay aspects as strategic groups, tactics and propper character development are nowhere to be found here. With its bleek heroes and dumb enemies FIVE: Guardians of David is something not worth your time or money.\n\nDisclaimer: Key was provided by developer for testing the game and for review purposes only\n\nFULL REVIEW[pcgamesnnews.wordpress.com]","March 3","false","5.9"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

You don't hack down 3 lions at a time, 1 lion alone is a big challenge. You don't slash random bears every now and then, you save your familys and neighbors sheep from small packs of wolves.\n- You don't curse the enemy with spells, summon familiars or heal yourself. You fight  with historical weapons and techniques.\n\nBad:\nThe game focuses on historical events, but it fails a bit much on following it through. I am tempted to make jokes about divine interventions.\n- When you load a saved game you will have to do the whole level over again, and everything you did during that level will be rolled back >.<\n- When fighting a boss, you first have no idea how you are supposed to defeat it. Then you die. Then you respawn at full health, while the boss has not healed anything, and you just smack it down. This feels like some awful way of cheating the game, it's not fun.\n- Everybody knows David killed Goliath with a slinger, and the game says so too. However, YOU will play David killing Goliath with a melee weapon. Why??\n- The game skips everything that happened from David kileld Goliath until he became an experienced commander. I want to know(play) what happened during that time!\n- Anybody in your party died? No worries, they'll magically respawn when the fight is over.\n- There's something wrong with the party mechanics.

I applaud the devs for trying to do something different and historical (I'm a history buff). It's nice to see someone try to do something different. Frankly, I think the idea is brilliant. The execution....not so much.\n\nAs a game, it's a failure on most every level. The gameplay is straight out of Diablo/Titan Quest/Grim Dawn with the one exception being that you can control multiple party members. As a game, Five has to be measured against that strong competition and it really fails to measure up. I've played it for an hour and have no desire to return to it (more on that in a moment).\n\nThe graphics/animations aren't good. Titan Quest is a decade old and looks better. The color pallet is muted and it's often tough to distinguish details on the screen. The animations are stiff and stilted. Enemies look just like your guys and it can be tough to figure out who is friend from foe unless you concentrate on the health bars above people's heads. The music/sound is ok though the voice acting is quite poor. Frankly, I wish they hadn't voice acted the game as just text would have been an improvement.\n\nThe cartoon interludes telling the story are pretty cool, if a little heavy-handed on the whole "ordained by God" thing and actually not accurate, That's actually pretty insulting. An example of this is when they're telling the story of David v. Goliath. In thie game David claims that he didn't need armor because he was protected by God. Nice try, but no. That's not how the story goes. He declined armor because he was not accustomed to wearing it! That's fairly unforgivable given how sacred some faiths hold the source material.\n\nBack to the game, your characters level but you have no influence over their leveling - you don't get to raise their stats or pick any new skills. You get what you get and that makes character advancement a dull affair.\n\nThe one gimmick in the gameplay  is that you can control multiple party members. However, it's more limited in reality since you can control only one at a time (and the others are woefully ineffective when you're not controlling them) this novelty quickly wears off. Other than that the gameplay is straight out of any Diablo-style game. Each one of the 5 characters you can control have different abilities but you're better off using the one guy who can stun everyone (I forget who that is). You'll find other characters not as useful. The abilites aren't anything to write home about and there's nothing that makes you go "wow". Kicking an opponent or lighting an arrow on fire isn't anything new in the genre.\n\nItemization isn't anything to write home about either. I know I was only an hour into the game but of the 5 characters, only one had any kind of decent weapon upgrade. Without being able to control your character advancement, itemization becomes far more important. I didn't see any real great shakes here and thus this is another missed opportunity. It did not feel rewarding to play through the game and not get any real upgrades to your characters. Now maybe later on new cool weapons fall like Frankincense and Myrrh from the sky but it didn't happen early enough in the game to compel me to keep playing.\n\nAs mentioned, the enemies are based on the Torah and therefore are pretty run of the mill. Just like the abilities, there's nothing here to make you go WOW! There are some wild variations on difficulty though and while you'll chew through most enemies easily some seem abnormally difficult even though they're still white (fodder) enemies.They're basically enemy soldiers.\n\nSo far what I've described is a fairly dull Diablo clone. Unfortunately, FIVE gets worse,\n\nOk, then finally we get to the bugs and the reason I'm no longer playing the game. I've hit four in the first hour.\n\n1. Gold from a chest dropped into an area of the screen my character couldn't access. Very minor.\n2. An enemy was shooting at me from an area on the map that I couldn't get to. That's pretty annoying.\n3. I managed to roll myself into the crowd and couldn't move in the boss battle against Goliath. He couldn't get to me and I couldn't get back out. So the only option was to restart the entire battle which required me to play through the ENITRE map again. Exceptionally annoying.\n4. The last was the boss battle at Shebitku. There's a spike trap that comes up to prevent your other characters from coming into a one-on-one fight. Except when I died (because the difficulty on this battle is so absurd that I died in two hits) the spikes didn't come back down. Thus I could not re-engage the boss. So I saved. And reloaded the save....and was again placed all the way back at the start of the level. That's enough. Done. Not coming back.\n\n\nSo as a game what you have is a poor Titan Quest clone with bad animations, no character development, poor itemization, boring enemies, muddled textures and that's VERY buggy. Beyond the novel concept and the nice developers there's nothing redeeming here. That's unfortunate because I'd love to see more historical games made outside the wargame genre. But I can't when the execution of the game is this poor. Thumbs down.","March 23","false","1.2"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

The voice acting is good and the game is responsive but it's just a little too plain in combat. There's a lot of character variety but there's no real challenge because if you die you respawn at a checkpoint with the enemies not regaining any health, so you can just get hand held through all this Bible lore you, let's face it, probably won't care about. I feel like the game could have been better or cooler with a different setting by was held back by the Bible setting. There's a lot of times where the lore is legit, "we made this character up, hardcore christians don't hate us". Overall I'd give this game a 2.5/5. Make the kids in bible school play this xD","March 22","false","1.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I only payed a few minutes but it was enough for me to quickly ask for my money back.  Very disappointing.","April 22","false","0.1"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","14","1","7","2","0"

I had a great time playing it, it was pretty fun. The combat got a little boring after a while. Your main attack is the left click which is also how you navigate. Your right mouse button is the power attack and then special moves are assigned to 1-4.\n\nI wish this game had a stat leveling system though, so you could put stats into certain attributes instead of the game just doing it naturally. I really did have a great time with this game though and do recommend it to those people who loved NN and DS.\n\nIf you are looking for a more action orientated RPG I do not recommend this game.","November 24, 2015","true","8.2"," 46 of 103 people (45%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","45","46","103","5","0"

It's an action RPG like Diablo based on biblical events. That these two don't mix too well would be an understatement. I'm not a very religious person, but having the protagonists of a biblical story kill lots of other beings while sprinkling in bits from the old testament feels very odd. The game itself is well presented, but the setting and story mixed with the gameplay just feel too weird to me.","December 19, 2015","false","9.2"," 8 of 27 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","8","27","0","0"

That's not an incredibly accolade, but it possesses it earned it nonetheless.\n\nIt's a mediocre Diablo clone with weak skills, weak loot, weak enemy variety, etc. I finally quit when I ran into a quest that required me to literally fight ten waves of the exact same enemy group in a tiny room. Between the clunky combat and drag-♥♥♥ level design, you really get the feeling that FIVE is just being stretched out as thin as it can to somehow pass itself off as a game.\n\nIt's a rush job. That much is clear. But it also suffers from some poor concepts, too. All five of the, well, FIVE are on screen at the same time. As well as David himself, and you swap between them X-Men Legends style. But X-Men Legends was designed to have four characters on screen simutaneously. Diablo, which FIVE is heavily based on, was not. It becomes chaotic and confusing, but the good news is that you were just going to mash the same button anyway.\n\nWant to see it for yourself?
