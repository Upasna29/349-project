"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyTenjoin/recommended/365160/","LadyTenjoin","LadyTenjoin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyTenjoin/","983 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe Gist of the Story\nKona is an immersive, mystery adventure game that takes place during the 1970s, near Atamipek Lake in Northern Canada. The game delves you into the role of Carl Faubert, a private detective who was hired to investigate vandalism happening on his client’s property. Normally, Carl would never go out his way for a person since they live in the isolated parts of Northern Canada but his client, William Hamilton, is a rich mine owner and the pay for the job was just too good to pass up.\n\nAs Carl ventures into the small settlement to meet his potential employer, his detective sense kicks in and realizes that there’s something odd going on. The local store, the location of the meeting place with Hamilton, is empty. In fact, every house he went to was void of humans. Confusion and curiosity begins to mix in together so he did what any good detective should do. Get to the bottom of this strange occurrence happening in place.\n\n---\n\nGameplay\nThis is an early access game so as of yet, 2-3 hours worth of gameplay is available at this time. It is written on the Steam page that only 30% of the game is unlocked in the current Early Access build so keep that in mind.  Now that’s out of the way, let me just say that Kona mainly consists of searching for clues about the events that befell the people of this Northern Canadian settlement. There is a narrator that will direct your actions should you ever lose your path. The narrator also supplies part of the overarching story, which is supplemented by journal entries and notes found throughout the places Carl will visit in his investigation.\n\nTo go from point A to B, Carl drives around in his trusty truck through a vicious blizzard that never calms down. With one hand on the steering wheel and the other on the map, if this was real life, I would be calling my insurance company several times because apparently, I am not the greatest driver. Just don’t make me the designated driver and everybody will stay alive, deal? I do like how natural driving is this game. Usually, driving in game isn’t my favorite feature but Kona does it right.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=643316349\n\nThere is combat in game as suggested by the rifle and melee weapons that can found but I didn’t have the chance to use it because the threat hasn’t revealed itself yet. From one of the notes I found, it seems as though there is a person or “Le Monstre” roaming around in the dense forest of Northern Canada controlling the local wolf population to do his bidding. It might be one of the Cree people, the local Natives that live in this part of Canada. They are not pleased with how Hamilton and the other settlers are ruining the natural order of their lands since there has been some logging and mining going around. It could also be a supernatural entity. This is just my guess as to what the threat would be.\n\nExploration is crucial to this game because it rarely tells you what to do. I say this because there are some hidden campsites and lodges not revealed on the map and they sometimes hold key items needed to continue the story. Key objectives will appear in Carl’s journal should he discover an important point or object. The narrator will comment once in awhile but it’s up to the player to piece together where to go next.\n\nThere are also elements of your basic survival game. In Kona, it isn’t too complex. You must keep warm to prevent hypothermia and keep your health up. There is a stress meter, which can be lowered by using consumables such as cigarettes. I didn’t see how the stress mechanic worked because there was rarely an instance that was stressful for Carl. However, in general cigarettes are used to calm someone’s nerves and Carl does have a smoking habit. The game notes that it is his “personal breathing assistant.” There is a bit of inventory management since there is a limited amount of weight our good detective can carry. I find myself just grabbing anything I can interact with and it’s rather ironic since Carl once mentioned that he isn’t a burglar. Of course, I will make you take everything, Carl! We might need it later (says the hoarder.)\n\nAre you still with me? Good, because I do want save this part of the game for last. Although Carl’s current objective is to find Mr. Hamilton, he stumbles upon a person encased in ice. Upon touching this unassuming ice-bound man, the good detective is given this vision of the past, in the form of apparitions going about the day they disappeared. It’s a pretty surreal experience and I’m not saying this is the first time I’ve seen this in a game but the way it was executed was well done. I look forward to more of this game mechanic since only 2 out of the 4 ice imprisoned people is available in the current early access build.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=643316945\n\n---\n\nGraphics and Technical Issues\nThe graphics are beautiful. It runs on the Unity 3D engine and I’ve experience no slow down in performance. My framerate is a consistent 60+ (Specs: GTX 970, i7-4790S, 12 GB of ram…so on and so forth). I do realize that my rig is more than enough to run almost all current games at max settings so I did some research in the Steam forums and saw that there are people experiencing performance issues. I’m reading that developers are working hard to optimize the game and they seem very involve in answering questions players might have.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=643316737\n\nI did run across a few micro stutters but I noticed that it always happened as I approached a house so I am surmising that the game is loading something there.\n\nI encountered no bugs during my game sessions but I have read that a player was having issues with a missing executable in their game files. This might be a rare occurrence since I’ve only seen one person report it but that is to be determined as more people starts playing Kona.\n---\n\n\nWrap Up\nLet me finish this up by saying that this a great example of what a Steam Early Access game should be. The story is engaging, good performance and no bs crashing on start up or riddled with bugs. The animations and sounds are superb and I can only speak from my experience so it may vary from person to person but I enjoyed every minute of Kona and I was slightly disappointed that the Early Access build ended at the point where I was absolutely sucked into its world.\n\nIf you’re interested in mystery games with some aspects of survival elements, you should definitely consider picking up Kona. I bought it since I have been following since its first announcement and I am very happy with my purchase.\n\n---\n\nTL;DR\nPros:\n\n- Immersive experience, great sounds and animations\n- Great Mystery game\n- Light puzzles that will flex your brains\n- Intriguing storyline\n\nCons:\n\n- Early access (not really a con and the game is not finished yet. However, I wanted to play more so I am bit salty.)\n- Players might experience performance issues, depending on their system\n\n---\n\nIf you stuck around me this long, and if you have the time, watch me fool around in Kona\n\nKona Video","March 11","true","8.9"," 44 of 49 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","44","49","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/365160/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFor all of the ♥♥♥♥ that gets thrown at Valve for its Early Access program on Steam there are genuinely some great gems that get added to the program that are perfect examples of its effectiveness. Parabole’s Kona is one such example. The amount of work and dedication that has gone into this game to get it to the point where it is without a doubt one of the best games in the program is astounding. The Canadian wilderness is captured almost flawlessly. It’s a breathtaking example of passionate developers possessing a thorough understanding of how to take a concept through to fruition.\n\nThe game is one of pure adventure that rewards exploration and you must do so in order to solve the mystery. However, you need to battle the wild conditions of the blizzard that has effected the region. The character that you play is detective Faubert. With his knowledge, experience and skill set you have all of the mental tools at your disposal to solve the mystery effecting the area. I personally believe that this is a game that is best experienced first hand and to deliver much in the way of spoilers would be detrimental to the game.\n\nWhat you do discover early in the game and which isn’t spoiled with spoilers is that the area that you arrive to is absolutely deserted. If you do not go into the building first it is the sight of a pair of wolves that alert you to the fact that something is just not right with the world. Wolves simply do not go into areas that are populated – they’ll hang around the fringes but never where there are people around. When you do enter the building you hear an explosion come from the outside. On discovery you find that an electricity power line has been snapped and normal electricity is cut. You must first find out how to power a generator lest Faubert die a horrible death from hypothermia.\n\nAside from the fabulous adventure and mystery aspects of the game I simply cannot go past the realism of the graphics. They make the game one of the most atmospheric that I have played thus far this year. I felt as though I truly was trapped in the blizzard. It’s very rare that weather effects behave and look as natural as how they are presented within the game. Further adding to the atmosphere is the absolutely spot on narration. It feels as though it could be out of the pages of Twin Peaks or Lost. The pace of the game is also a distinct advantage towards building the atmosphere.\n\nThere are things that can be improved such as the controls which need to be tightened up for the final release and I feel that the game doesn’t provide you enough feedback as to what you should achieve next. On the latter point I’d like to see the game provide some basic sort of objectives. There were small periods of time where I was wondering aimlessly not entirely certain where I needed to go next or what I had to do to unlock the next piece of the game. I’d like the devs to take a look at something like The Witcher 3 and similar games and their objective/quest based systems. It keeps the world open enough to exploration and allows the player the freedom to do almost whatever they want but it also keeps the player on track for when they do feel lost and  want to get back on course so to speak.\n\nI probably will not return to Kona until it’s at retail release but that’s because I do not want to have the game spoiled before it reaches its fully realized version. It’s already something pretty special and I believe that the developers will take it all of the way.\n\nFor our epic giveaways and similar reviews head to http://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo join in our fantastic community join our Steam group","March 26","true","2.2"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","30","38","0","0"

With a 93% favorability score on Steam at this current time, you can guess this is going to be a positive review of the game.\n\nWhat is Kona?\n\nKona is a first person adventure game set in the northern territories of Canada during the 1970s. The protagonist of the story is tasked with solving surreal and paranormal events in a now uninhabited region close to Atamipek Lake. Currently 30% of the game's map is available in Early access. A large enough area to feel engrossed in for many hours.\n\nGameplay\n\nThis area of the game shines bright like a supernova.\n\nUnlike the Long Dark, your character (Carl Faubert) has access to a Chevrolet. The ability to drive around the unforgiving Canadian winter is a wonderful feature which allows you to appreciate the force of mother nature from the safe comfort of your heated car. Your characters animations whilst positioned inside the car all add to the realism the Canadian developers of Kona are pushing for. Upon entering the car from the sub-freezing temperatures, your character will warm his hands in front of the radiator. Whilst driving you can see Carl's feet shift from the accelerator to the brake. Whilst reversing Carl will look over his shoulder to see where the rear of his vehicle is going. It's these little details that really enhance the value of the game experience.\n\nYour character can traverse all that he sees,except for of course the remianing 70% of the game world which will be released in June. Within this 30% however, there are numerous houses to explore including a multi-purpose garage and lodges. Within these buildings, Carl can open practically everything he sees to build up on his supplies. Once outside, Carl can walk through the severe blizzard. Here like the driving, the small attention to detail shines through. Not only can you look at your characters shoes in the snow, but he will leave his foot trail behind him. Similalry wildlife will also leave its tracks in the snow. Once I was following wolf prints, which eventually led me to a road. The trail stopped. Upon close examination I realised that the tracks continued on the opposite side of the road. Of course the trail had gone cold upon nearing the road as cars had used the road.\n\nI've played the Forest, Stranded Deep and the Long Dark but there is nothing more satisfying than Kona's simple yet wonderfully realised crafting menu. Kona relies upon you finding certain resources to 'combine' so as to overcome obstacles in the world. Be it fixing broken down generator or simply lighting a fire to deter the affects of hypothermia. Your character can only carry a certain amount of extra weight so at times you will need to discard items found to pick up temporarily more useful items. Fortunately the inventory can hold rather a lot.\n\nUnique features\n\nIn the first few minutes of the game, the player can pick up a polaroid camera. As this is a polaroid camera, the shots you take are developed immediately and you can hold the photo you took up to the real life landmark. It's a simple gamplay mechanic but oh so sweet. I think I've taken over 300 photos now with my trusty polaroid which might explain why I'm nearing maximum carrying capacity!\n\nVisuals\n\n"Stunning". "Absolutely stunning". Those are the word I kept repeating to myself on my first playthrough. The game is built on the Unity engine but you would think its on UE4! It is near photorealistic in its depiction of a Canadian winter. The textures are incredibly detailed and the colour palette of the game is "just right" as goldilocks would say.\n\nSound design\n\nKona has one of the best sound effects I have heard in any game to date. In terms of quality, I would say Kona is on par with Alien Isolation in the sound department. From the howling of the unrelenting blizzard to the static of a TV, Kona's sounds will immerse you in its story and transport you to 1970's Canada.\n\nValue\n\nAt £7 this game is fantastic value for money. Your not just purchasing yet another Early Access crafting/ exploration game. Your purchasing another crafting/ exploration game whose devleopers have looked at the genres and 'thought you know what, we can do better'. You know what, I think they have. Neither the forest nor Stranded deep have entertained me the same way Kona has. It's the atmosphere, sound design and visuals all coalescing together which make Kona such a joy to experience.\n\nConclusion\n\nI bought Kona slightly dubious of the re-play value it would offer me, caution which has proven to be unwarranted. Yes the main focus of the  game is focused around solving a mystery, so its story driven. However, it more than that. Far more. The Canadian winter holds onto you with its icy vice, a grip which though unsettling compells you to explore to reveal the mysteries which lie around Atamipek Lake.","March 15","true","8.0"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","26","32","0","0"

The game is currently in beta/early access, so only some parts of the game are accessible.\n\nCheck out my Quick Beta Preview here: https://youtu.be/MgPeuR3nMU0\nThe game takes place in northern Canada during a blizzard, and you are sent to investigate the small community. The game is very immersive, and the gameplay heavily revolves around exploration to find clues, various crafting items, and figuring out puzzles to solve the mystery of what happened in the town.\n\nYou drive a truck around to cover distances quickly, and normally I don’t like driving with keyboard, but the truck handled extremely well, too well actually, considering there’s a blizzard and snow on the ground, but at least it wasn’t frustrating to use. You are stuck on the main roads though, and aren’t able to take the truck off road at all, so you also do a fair bit of hiking.\n\nThe story so far is intriguing, and you learn about some of the characters through visions as well as various texts that you will find by exploring the areas thoroughly.\n\nSounds effects are fantastic! I love the sounds of the wind and snow blowing through the trees, and the crunching of the snow under my feet. Reminds me a lot of how Firewatch felt so alive. The narrative in Kona was good, and I liked the dialog, but I felt like the narrator’s voice sounded a little too much like movie announcer, and I didn’t enjoy it as much as I enjoyed the characters in Firewatch.\n\nPros:intriguing story so far, and it will leave wanting more\nsound effects, and music are fantastic and help to create an immersive atmosphere\nenvironment looks good (love the reduced visibility in the blizzard)\nthe dialog is good, the narrator tells it well\nthere are some traits that you need to maintain to survive (temperature, stress, and health), but they aren't too challenging to keep up on, so they don't take away from the exploration or become a chore\nthe truck handles well, while driving the truck with WASD\nyou can use the back of the truck as storage when you hit the maximum carrying capacity\nCons:it’s weird that you WANT your stress level to be at 100%; when I first started, I thought that stress was bad, and that I had to have closer to 0%, so I think that should be changed to be a little more clear.\ncan't look at the map while parked in vehicle (it’s silly to have to get out to check the map)\nfeels like the driver's view is too far back from the dash (you see too much of the truck's interior)\ncouldn’t scroll down to read all the text, so some details were missed\nsome minor texture issues with trees and rocks changing as you move closer to them, and it did hurt the immersion slightly (but I expect that will be fixed up before release)\nmodels for the wolves are not very well animated compared to the rest of the game, and you can't kill the wolves by running them over with your truck\nI enjoyed the overall look and feel of the atmosphere, but there was one thing that really bothered me… The character you play as is a detective, so I presume that he has decent observation skills, however, he takes a trip to northern Canada, into a blizzard, and he doesn’t even wear proper clothing!! Ok, I don’t know why, but this really bothers me a lot more than it should. As someone who lives in Canada, who has shoveled snow in a blizzard, it just blows my mind to see my character with bare hands, and it makes me cold just thinking about it. I also imagine that my feet are freezing, and I am probably not even wearing a toque either. Please, let me put some gloves on!! Please?\n\nI played beta for roughly 3.5 hours, but since some of the content is locked for beta, I can’t complete the story, but I am looking forward to the full release. So far, the game feels good, and is a mostly enjoyable experience, but I would like to see some of the things that annoyed me get improvements before full release. If you enjoy atmospheric exploration adventures, then Kona might be right up your alley.","May 20","true","3.7"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","16","18","3","5"

The game world is relatively open, and you can do things in the order that you like. So it is not as linear as most traditional adventure games.

It might be short, but for the expirience you'll get, this price is a steal.\n\ntl;dr: A must have.\n\nGraphics\nI have a pretty old PC. Can't say that the game runs fine, but, considering all the details, it is. Any more or less recent rig shouldn't have any problems running it.\n\nKona looks beautiful. Rare case when effects are not just to be there because "it's cool". This is the first game in which I left bloom on, because it actually adds to the atmoshpere. DoF needs tweaking for my taste, but again DoF isn't there just for the sake of DoF.\n\nVideo settings exactly as they should be in any game. Not only can you switch/tweak them but also there are explanations for each and every one. This is love and care for customers right there! I can't even express how much I appreciate this.\n\nAlthough, I wouldn't mind to see DoF slider and FilmGrain switch.\n\nSound/Music\nSound is good. Nothing amazing, but solid. just enough to get you into the atmosphere of a cold winter.\nMusic. So far noticed only beautiful intro and downright creepy radio songs. Not sure if that's just me or this creepiness was intentional.\n\nStory\nHard to tell. There's not much of a story as of right now, but what is there is intriguing. Narration is good.\n\nAtmosphere/Gameplay\nLast but probably most improtant and impossible to explain.\nThe atmosphere is there and that is already amazing and the reason in itself to buy any game.\n\nIf you need any comparisons, it definetley has cold loneliness from The Long Dark, and maybe some "twinpeaksneashness".\n\nIt is an exploration game, but what does that really mean? You go places and find ♥♥♥♥. Animations are so good and detailed that you're enjoying the procces of exploration, trying to understand what has happened here.\n\nThough, there is a problem with moving around: you can get stuck on some logs, staircases, boxes, doorways etc. Nothing big and gamebreaking, but a bit annoying. Jumping is useless.\n\n\nConclusion:\nIt's an amazing game which worth a price even in the 'early access' state.\nMuch respect to the devs.","March 10","true","2.3"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

(This video could be big SPOILERS for you, so please buy and play the game yourself and avoid all videos if you want to avoid spoilers)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgCcY4yeuDk\n\nSo far, this game has been a joy to play and the drama is already starting to unfold and raise lots of intrigue.\n\nYou start the game as a private investigator traveling to help a wealthy man who owns some mines and a general store in a very small and bitter cold northern area of Canada.  You start this adventure just before you arrive at his general store, but a locked gate blocking your progress, then a crazy blizzard seem to tell you right away that this will be no ordinary investigation.  After you arrive to meet the wealthy man who is hiring you, I don't want to spoil anything.. but things really start to get crazy quickly as lots of dramatic clues and mysterious things continue to unfold before your eyes.  It gets good quick and draws you in just like any good movie, but in this one.. you play the star role!\n\nThe graphics, the sound, and the gameplay are all very immersive, Where as other story games like this are more walking simulators that unfold a story as you merely walk around, this is much more of a game that you play the part in and reveal a story as you play within it's world.\n\nMore to come, and I will give a proper review once I complete Act 1, but for now.. all I can say is that this looks to be a very nice hidden gem and well worth its asking price.","March 10","true","5.8"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","15","22","2","0"

This game is ver excellent the 3rd person narrative is a catchy way to play the game and provides a few good laughs along the way.  The graphics are excellent and provide a great atmosphere.\n\nYou play the role of a detective who is brought in to solve a mystery in a small town near Quebec, Canada.  The purpose is to search throughout the town and gather evidence and clues about the people who live there.  The way that they have put this together left me wanting to play more and more to try and figure out what is happening.\n\nI reccomend this game to any one who likes mystery/detective series and potentially for those who like the survival games as well as this does have a bit of that too.\n\nif you don't believe me check out my video here and see for yourself if it is worth it ... can't wait for more!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvnXpegVqJU&index=1&list=PL1vSlpdFtywUv1vYTYiu1XJmFUJSJkom-","April 5","true","7.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

Having  deeper survival mechanics will add tension and stress which can conflict with the game's relaxed yet eerie tone. However, late game focuses more on survival.\n2. Problem Solving, Not Puzzle Solving\nGame is more about searching in some-what clever spots for items rather than solving a puzzle. A little more than common sense is required.\n\nCons:\n1.

Being that it's Early Access and the story will be released in Episodes, don't expect an ending or perfection. If you haven't figured out what EA is or means, you might want to study up a bit on that. I've been alone in an old vehicle in a snow storm a few times. The devs have conveyed that eerie silence and quiet, hopeful worry that goes along with being in a similar situation quite well. The physics of the old truck, the chassis' squeeky protests that come with hitting the occasional bump and the not-so-sure feeling that you have a good chance of losing control, getting stuck or not being able to make it up a steep hill. Very nicely done.\n\nThe first person walking is well done right down to the crunching snow and how you slow down when you turn around and walk backwards. I feel like I'm being watched if not downright followed. The narration is a bit odd, over-explanitory and robotic. The narrators voice sounds authentic and fine, but I wonder if it might be a good idea to just have the character narrate his own thoughts and actions instead, possibly making it feel more personal and immersive. I being able to open lots of containers even if I know there's a good chance there will be nothing in them.  The more functional the surroundings, the better. The only thing that annoyed me was having to twist around and reposition so much trying to highlight the right interaction (open, close etc.) for drawers, containers etc. I'm looking straight at something when I want to interact with it. Not to the side in a mini peripheral manner. Not to completely discount that mechanic, but this may be a good idea when you're overly stressed, very cold and/or had too many brewskies. But if I'm ok I should be afforded a little more control/precision. So that's it. I think it's worth the money and I'm looking forward to fine tuning and future episodes.\n\n","May 10","true","4.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Several people have made reference to Twin Peaks and The X-Files in their reviews, which was a primary reason for my purchase of the game. I have to agree with the sentiment. Between the weather effects, quiet ambient music well placed throughout the game, and the entertainingly crime-noir style narrating, this game is loaded with atmosphere that lends towards a creepy and off-kilter vibe.\n\nWhile the graphics aren't like that of a AAA game, they aren't shabby either. Some of the textures look a bit muddy, but it's easily forgivable in my book and doesn't really detract from the game for me. I mentioned the weather effects earlier, and I feel they're one of the more outstanding parts of the game. The snowstorm you find yourself in builds and dissipates with the wind, and has the tendency to obscure your vision at crucial moments, which adds to the tension the game works to build. Driving is heavily affected by the snow and visibility as well, and gave me flashbacks to my time living in South Dakota dealing with blizzards.\n\nThe only detractor for the game, and the only reason I wouldn't recommend buying it, is that it's incomplete. I played for around two hours and found that there wasn't much else I could do, then wanted more. The Devs are saying it'll be completed hopefully end of april, and I truly hope they make good on that. I want more. If you're okay with playing a beta-version and getting hooked without being able to get your fill, I'd say drop the ten bucks and check it out, otherwise just wait a month or so.","April 17","true","1.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This is what I was hoping for with Firewatch. Firewatch is great, don't get me wrong, but Kona is way better. If you've played Firewatch, imagine a similar game, but much less casual, with more mystery and suspense, sometimes bordering on panic, paranoia, and downright terror. Survival is a key element, along with investigative elements, and some supernatural/paranormal stuff too. Oh, and it takes place in a open world like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter (another similar game) and there is the mother of all blizzards going on around you.\nI can tell I am going to spend a LOT of time on this. :)","May 1","true","2.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I checked every now and then the advancement, waiting for a release date. When the demo came out, I was astonished, the game was perfect, it was exactly what I expected from this game. I bought the EA this week. I played 1 minute only and exited the game immediately. Why? because there is no french narration.\nCe qui m'a vraiment fait accroché au jeu était la narration française québécoise, LÀ je me sentais vraiment au Québec. Quand j'ai entendu la voix anglaise ça m'a complètement rebutté, et pas d'option pour changer ça!! Allez-vous l'ajouter dans la version finale?

It is so amazing what this small team managed to achieve in such a short period of time. These guys are always interacting with the community and giving updates. I don't have any doubts that they will get the job done.\n\nI am from Canada and I can say that this game really nailed it in term of depicting the setting of the story. So much attention and details in graphics and mechanics, with lots of references to the timeframe where it takes place. These guys obviously made a lot of research and that reflected very positively on the immersive experience that Kona offers. I got my money's worth just by wandering in this snowy country.\n\nBut don't get me wrong, this game is not only about exploration.

Likely. Do I recommend the EA version? No. There's really very little to do, and I'm not even sure why they released this in this form unless they were just running out of money. The game would have done a lot better in the long run if they had just finished it and then put it out there.\n\nRight now, I couldn't even get into the mysterious side of the story because there isn't enough there. Also, this is nothing like Firewatch at this point (as other reviews claim). Could it ever reach that level and go beyond? Possibly, but I doubt it. We'll see at early release.\n\nTechnically, it's okay except for the sound. The narrator is poorly recorded, and I don't particularly care for the deadpan delivery of every line. The graphics are fine.  The UI is a mess and takes extra effort to work.\n\nSo we'll see what the final version looks like. I like the premise, but the user reviews are way overselling this.\n\nResponse to the developer:  I appreciate the developer responding. Here's the thing. I love exploring when there's a purpose to it, but there's not a purpose to it in this game yet. I love walking simulators and I love exploration games, and I love early access games, but when you put those three things together, they create a mess.\n\nAs I said, I will likely enjoy the final version and will edit the review then.","March 24","false","1.1"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","15","29","0","3"

The atmosphere and the visuals in this game are superb and after the amount of fun I had with Firewatch recently I was eager to try out another atmospheric walking sim and Kona is showing a good deal of promise.\n\nAs you explore the sleepy town you encounter visions of spirits and slowly uncover the bodies of the town folk frozen in ice and thus starts your adventure trying to work out what happened to the townsfolk in the abandoned town.\n\nYou must also manage your health, warmth and stress. These never seemed to present any real problem however as all were readily available and provided you drove your car from place to place then this provided easy access to warmth.\n\nThere were quite a few mechanics obviously present in this version that should be fleshed out in the full release. Firstly the story is unfinished but what I experiences was fun. There is also a lot of items you can collect and craft such as firearm ammunition which was not obviously useful and a weird magnet bobble reel thing which I never found the materials I needed to build throughout my play through and completion of all of the current early access versions plot.\n\nI really enjoyed the relatively short time I spent playing what Kona has to offer and look forward to playing more as the full game edges release. Its mix of Firewatch, Gone Home with some survival elements thrown in make this a definite on to watch when it comes out of Early Access in a few months.\n\nAN EARLY ACCESS KEY WAS PROVIDED BY THE DEVELOPER HOWEVER MY THOUGHTS AND OPINIONS ARE COMPLETELY MY OWN.\n\nCheck out our video preview Here:  The Game Tutor Examines Kona	[www.thegametutor.co.uk]","March 14","true","1.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It looks great and is very polished, however there is very little here. You walk around in a canadian snow storm solving tiny and tedious puzzles and scavenging through abandoned cabins hoping to find the story (or anything more entertaining for that matter.). The world looks gorgeous and a lot of work has been put into this game, yet it lacks so much. After you continue playing you quickly lose sight of what you were initially trying to do in the game and it all just seems to fade away. All the novelty wears off and the absent story wears thin.\n\nConceptually, it's a great idea, however i can't recommend in it's current state.

I don't care if it's only 12 minutes, siving through literally 100s of mediocre games and a gem comes along which hits so many good points.\n\nWell worth the experience, buy it!","May 4","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's got some spooks in it which I always love. But the gameplay itself I believe makes this game so great. Lots of interactivity with items and combining things to progress. I also want to say that the narration is awesome. Most times I don't care too much for it in games, but this one is great. Reminds me a bit of the Stanley Parable. Can't wait for this game to be complete.","May 3","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Driving is therapeutic, and I love how I immediately feel safe when I get inside the car. The story is interesting and it will keep you going, even thought is not completely released yet. It doesn't feel like the puzzles are broken into parts, it's more like the whole game is a puzzle and you will have to visit the same place more than one time to figure everything out. Right now you can explore everything in 5 hours or so. If you are unsure whether to buy this game right now, definitely buy it when it comes out fully. Either way, you won't regret it.\n\nThings that happened and surprised me:\n*I got attached to a specific house which I go back to whenever I want to save and quit the game.\n*It seems I instinctively know what to do when I'm in trouble, because it feels like a real life problem...\n*... but it took a very long while for me to figure out you can drop things inside the truck instead of being on 99% weight all the time.\n*The characters aren't very likable, but you know, typical small town. That's the one thing that I didn't like much about the game.  but since you don't have to actually interact with them, you can easily ignore their personalities and get the job done","May 24","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
