That said, the old game has lost none of its charms. There is one race short of a dozen playable ones, and fifteen classes. Each race offers its own little perks, and each class has amazing abilities and powers. Combine this with the plethora of items and magic, and you'll be experimenting with different combinations over and over again.\nThat being said, it is an old game. The graphics are pixellated (go cry in Skyrim if that's what you care about, you horrid wretch) and the control system is outdated (I spent fifteen minutes pressing WASD until I realized it was the arrow keys that moved the party). And it has the "old school difficulty": if your party isn't properly made or if you're missing a member (IE: someone who can tank or cast spells), you're going to get mercilessly butchered by the first boss creature, repeatedly.\n\nI'd recommend this game to all of my friends. It's amazing, it's fun, it's inviting, and it's dynamic. It's an age-old, forgotten gem that has lost none of its charm.\n\nTL;DR: It's a better version of Legends of Grimrock\n\nPS: Hey Steam, why not release other good, old games like Betrayal in Krondor/Antara while you're at it?","November 28, 2013","true","6.5"," 97 of 107 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","97","107","0","0"

I was originally planning to get it simply for Systemshock 2, but this wonderful game came along with it. after doing some research, i found out just how loved it was, so I tried it for myself.\n\nBasic, spoiler free tldr Plotline: Create your party, grab 3 artifacts and stop evil dude from doing the same, whist exploding everyone and everything that stands in your way of saving the world.\n\nThe plot is pretty much put to the wayside in my own opinon, but it is interesting enough to be noteable.\n\nAt first, It can be a bit daunting for players used to newer RPGs, but everything is very well streamlined when it comes to the User Interface and inventories. That is, once you get used to it.\n\n\nCombat:\nBasic lowdown: up to six PC's and two followers fighting together against enemies, using ranged, melee, or magic, with enemies in a 3d space. Works in a similar way to the older FFs, and is very fun at as well as aggrivating in earlier stages.\nThe game spices up this style of combat  by applying the strategies of positioning and formations, which are vital for both staying alive and dealing damage. The enemies have a bad tendency to be either mediocore or brutal, crushing your party to a pulp at times. But, the combat remains rather balanced throughout, and exciting.\n\nCharacters and Character Progression:\nMuch like Oblivion or Morrowind, each character has Basic Stats that can only be raised through leveling up, and Skill Stats that can be leveled both through gaining levels or by use in combat. Creating a character that fits his or her role into the party is absolutely esssential, and if not created properly, can permanently cripple the party. To survive basically, you need at least one Melee character in the front, a Ranged in the back, along with a caster to support them. Character classes basically divvy up the general roles into more specifc ones, with some classes unable to use certain weapons, you must choose carefully.\nThe combinations of both races and classes, and the distribution of stat points allows for immense variety in playstyles, from the practical to the ridiculous.\nProbably my favorite thing about the progression is seeing how far my party has come from the beginning. From my caster being barely able to cast basic magic to being a Lord of Death on the battlefield, erasing damage to party members and boosting their stats to ridiculous levels.\nAnother thing that stands out is the wide variety of Voice packs that each character can posess, and can be changed at any time. From laid back to the edge of sanity, sultry or sneaky, your choice. My favorites are the Male and Female Chaotic voices. These add much needed soul to the game, as well as some laughs.\n\nGraphics:\nThe game looks "Good Enough" for the modern age of games. Thankfully, with programs included such as Nglide, the game can run on just about anything. Laggy areas can be prevalent, even on modern, top of the line PC's, but usually, it will run at a glorious 60fps. What makes it even better, is that Steam Cloud saving for some odd reason works perfectly with this game, and the game's saves can flawlessly transfer from computer to computer.\n\nStuff I do not like about this game:\nThis game is hands down the best of this specifc genre that I have ever played, but it still has its flaws.\n\n-quests and objectives can be rather ambigous, and without the help of online guides, some of these can be very frustrating.\n-Crafting recipies are never revealed in game, which can be agrivating unless you have them online.\n-Travelling the world can be rather slow, as it is quite expansive, and portal spells can only be unlocked later in the game.\n-Saving is a bit awkward, having to go into the options menu every time can get annoying.\n-Starting off on the wrong foot party wise can lead to a near impossible playthrough.\n\nOtherwise, I heartily recommeded to those wishing to sink a lot of time into a great, easily scaleble game.","October 20, 2014","true","87.0"," 56 of 57 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","56","57","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steelrend/recommended/245450/","Steelrend","Steelrend","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steelrend/","126 products in account","Not certain about the why of my doing this, but here's my remark on Wizardry 8. I just leave it here (beware of much text ahead).\n\nStraight to the point. Wizardry 8 is a fabulous game. I mean, the best game ever. Only after over 500 hours played I'm realizing that all of my best loved games are just no way superior to this masterpiece. Powerful artifacts, deadly encounters, incredible adventures – this is Wizardry 8 in a nutshell. Like any other game of its kind, Wizardry 8 is definitely not going to be appraised in terms of mere good or bad. Once in a little while it looks completely genial, sometimes you are like “What the hell were they dreaming of introducing this?!”, but rather more often you simply don't know how to react to what you see on the screen.\n\nWizardry 8 is both amazing with its exceptional gameplay features and frustrating with its outrageous flaws. It provides a vast open world which should teem with lots of NPCs engaged in profound interactions, but for some reason it is nowhere nearly true. This world itself is not going to be lively and frolic of any kind. The sparse Dominus dwellers resemble me some kind of heartless automata, and only brilliant dialogues are the ones to persuade that these wretched beings are actually sentient and full of life. Most of player's concerns are confined to insane scouring areas for valuable loot and exterminating representatives of the local fauna, the remains of the later ones to be involved into a biological cycle.\n\nMany of the classes are interesting to try out and even extraordinary, though some of them seem not entirely refined. For instance, the samurai class. In my vision, these guys are implied to be ultimate fearless warriors, slicing their enemies into multiple pieces, casting thunder storm over them simultaneously. But like it was implemented in the game, a samurai will never exceed the plain fighter since he tends to get exhausted too quickly and even is not able to go berserk upon his foes. Similarly, he's barely capable of serving as a decent spellcaster for his getting some epic spells rather late, not counting the wizardry spellbook being not the most effective. It's also worth mentioning the minor racial abilities. For example, the faeries possess a natural bonus to AC which is predictably to be explained by their small size and high mobility. However, that gives no considerable benefits to their survivability in combat – enemies will regularly hit your faerie, shamelessly ignoring her gift. Some races weren't given any specific talents at all.\n\nWizardry 8 is notable for its marvellous sounds and music, yet even this trait is innerly inconsistent. The musical compositions are great enough, but not various and for sure not numerous. Many of the sound effects are so stunningly convincing that sometimes they pierce your head, with sudden death of your character from Boiling Blood causing an emotional trauma.\n\nThe auto-levelling system seems to make sure there is always a match to your heroes from the beginning towards the very end, but it proves to be broken inside. Being more precise, it comes out in that your party is often going to get either gutted by powerful beasts far greater or simply bored to death by those who are many levels lower than your buddies.\n\nThe ferocious randomness and merciless monster respawning are supposed to make your characters’ life unbearable by all means. Having gone insane, a fighter will stab down his party mate just in a couple of casual swings, or give an instant deathblow to that one who urgently needs healing. Miscasted spells will backfly by chance which may turn demise for the whole party. Your enemies themselves will show up just from nowhere and tread your group around swiftly, leaving you no chances to get away. Bad enough they appear in enormous packs, but they also have ridiculous amounts of health and are always glad to perform some nasty tricks for you. Those encounters can be infernally difficult at times, yet they ultimately cause you build your team sensibly, with equal dedication to every single member.\n\nEither of those features seems not to be able to handle itself, to say nothing of how they all were supposed to get along with one another. That being said, overlapping and twisting into a disproportionately shaped entity, they basically form Wizardry 8’s tangled consistency. Deprived of any of them, the whole thing will get collapsed.\n\nBut enough vilifying for right now. What’s so special about Wizardry 8?\n\nFirst of all, this game offers the most complicated character development system I have ever seen. It enables you to create a team of spunky adventurers, each of whom (in his own pathetic way) is going to embody your personal ideas on what the true hero should be. For a spry hardcore player, there’s a possibility to create a party of one – that’s when the real challenge begins. You can also import your characters from Wizardry 7 – then it gets even more interesting.\n\nWizardry 8 got a tremendous score of replayability. Here one will find a lot of everything to tinker with: races, classes, skills, spells and so much more. Such a range of variety makes you dizzy of numerous options, meaning that none of your replays will be similar to one another.\n\nThe communication system is rather unique to any game known to me – instead of clicking text-lines you are suggested to pick out a subject from the text on your own, and note that not interacting with everyone you encounter you’re going to cluelessly stagger around, futilely trying to figure out what’s the point and what you should do now. Rare NPCs you meet may not seem much sensible outside, nevertheless they have many interesting thoughts to share, and who knows what innermost secrets they may keep? Practically each of events happening to the group is accompanied by charming remarks let out by your adorable characters what in a way makes you believe they are real personalities. You see just the portraits of them all the time, with only lips moving and eyes blinking, but they do a great work towards convincing you they are alive.\n\nThankfully, Wizardry 8 lacks in annoying cut-scenes and stretched videos, as well as evident hints at what you need to do next and where head for, like ‘walk there, kill that bad guy, enjoy the ending’. All you got is your own mind to apply and the vast open world to explore, full of obscure menaces and incredible adventures. The conditions of victory are stated explicitly, but what are the ways of pursuing them is not as clear. Upon the emergency landing on Dominus, one thing proves undoubtful, though: the fact of your party surviving a shipwreck is definitely not a prospect for having a nice trip after all. Prepare for a long and arduous journey which involves reaching celestial heights and diving in the ocean abyss, creeping along spooky dungeons and roaming around a whole city built up on a tree, meeting old comrades and making some new friends as well. You'll have to handle interracial disputes and solve fancy puzzles, and in the end of your adventure you're going to save the world, of course!\n\nI'm being out of space to write in, so let's get approaching a closure. To sum up all the stuff mentioned above, I’d say Wizardry 8 is a genuinely unique RPG game featuring challenging yet still rewarding gameplay, immersive rpg system, overwhelming sounds and adorable dialogues. It's the case when originality and inconsistency blended together make for products of the highest quality. Too bad such a game was irreverently forgotten.\n\nPS the text was initially written in another language and I couldn't squeeze it into a steam review due to the dumb limitation to about 2000 symbols. But once I stumbled across a review which, being written in English, was twice longer than mine having been cut short. So the main reason I even began writing a translation of the original draft for was my hope to win up some extra letters that way.","August 12, 2015","true","299.1"," 50 of 53 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","50","53","5","0"

I never played 6, played a bit of 7 but 8 is something special. If you have fond memories of the might and magic series, especially perhaps 6-8, and other ,more recent ones like Legend of Grimrock for example ( although that  has battles in real-time)   then wizardry 8 might scratch that 'rpg' itch.\n\nIt's a game where you control 6 characters, all highly customizable with several races, classes and a whole pool of skills and perks and go adventuring finding loot, exploring, levelling up and engaging in turn based battles. In fact even picking your party can be a daunting task with so many choices to make that can affect your chances especially the further into the game you go.\n\nA word of warning though. This is a hard game. It can be unforgiving and frustrating even in the early stages which may involve a lot of running away and going back until you beat a particualr enemy or enemies. Indeed, at points there are a lot of enemies, sometimes unfairly so, and they come thick and fast where luck and frequent saves are sometimes the only way to progress. And, although i have no way of knowing how many hours i played this game ( but i would guess in excess of 50/60 hours) i never completed it. This is more due to the fact after upgrading my pc, the discs no longer worked and so  it was put aside but never forgotten.  Until now.\n\nIt's great it' has appeared on steam and i am looking forward to tackling it once again. If you have the time to invest in it; the patience to put up with some rage inducing losses; the vision to look past it's dated but functional graphics and the love of a deep, complex and involving rpg with great turn based mechanics and characters that  actually have a personality and some great lines, then give Wizardry 8 a go.","September 10, 2013","true","8.8"," 39 of 40 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","39","40","0","0"

It seems clear that Sir-Tech was working hard to modernize their game while still keeping the depth of their old games, and it's a shame they couldn't have gotten past this point to create a Wizardry 9 that would have more fully brought the game into being both a modern RPG as well as the homage to the RPGs of years past.

It inherits the typical early 2000 engine limitations and quirks. You will probably get stuck sometimes, you will get crushed by physics objects (death by crates!) and you will get stuck behind patrolling friendly NPCs, who are surpsingly headstrong in walking in front of you slowly, or walking through you, pushing you along and frustrating you.

I was so enthralled whenever I watched him play it because of the gameplay and the character-creation. When I played it after I got older and was able to better grasp the mechanics of the game, I was still in love.\nThe first part of most RPGs, character creation, is an experience itself. With many races and classes to choose from, there is plenty of variety because you not only create 1 character, but you create 6. The races range from the Tolkienesque races to some really cool and unique playable races (Dracon. Faerie, Lizardman, Mook to name a few)There are plenty of different classes to choose from also. Developing your characters throughout the game is also great. There are many spells to use too.\nThe game plays like many of the old school RPGs like M&M in a FPS type. Just watch the video to get the idea. Wiz 8 was the last of a dying breed when it came out, but I personally enjoy the gameplay. Combat is turnbased while exploring is free roam.\nThe story of Wiz 8 is actually pretty fascinating and proves to be enagaging at times. I'll leave it there and let it unfold for you because I had the story spoiled for me and I will never forget it. I wish it wasn't spoiled.\nAll in all, I can praise and review and talk about how fun Wiz 8 is til I'm blue in the face. For 10 bucks its a steal (comes fully patched and the graphics are improved compared to the original release.) considering to get a CD copy is about 50 bucks.

Simple as that. And not only is it the final game in the Wizardry series, it is also the final of the Dark Savant Trilogy, which consists of Wizardry 6, 7 and 8. We had to wait nine years for 8 after VII, but you know what, it was worth the wait. To some of us anyway. For those of us that played Wizardry Gold, the wait was a little shorter, but still, five years is a long time to wait for the final story of an amazing story arch and series of games.\n\nDepending on how you ended VII, if you did, then you have multiple beginning story archs to be a part of, then again, so to you have multiple endings.\n\nRemember in the beginning of Zelda: OoT, where you have to find the three gems to unlock the Temple of Time? Well, I think that borrowed from this entire story, because that is it. You have to find three gems, but make no mistake... you will not do it as quickly as you'd like. And then the story is just plain weird after you get them, because then you have to become a Templar. And well... that is the funny part, you will see.\n\nThis title also takes away from the stepping from spot to spot of the previous two titles and you are able to walk (via first-person perspective) and turn and such in a full 3D environment. And even better, you can see the enemies this time, no random popping of battles. It may not seem like it, but in its day, this was amazing stuff to see. This game is amazing even today, so give it a go, you will enjoy it. It's fluid, it's great, and it will make you laugh with some of the story stuff, but I will not spoil anything.\n\nThere are also mods for the game, however I have not tried any yet, as I am still giving it a go in vanilla forme.\n\nThe game runs great, has multiple beginning and ending story paths and tells a great story for its time. I recommend this, especially if you enjoy the older RPG titles of PC gaming.","October 10, 2014","true","5.0"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","15","15","0","0"

You're even annoyed that those games aren't featuring turnbased combat. And the setting seems too familiar like something done a million times before.\n\nWelcome to Wizardry 8. Pretty much the pinnacle of turnbased dungeoncrawler cRPG's. This one is gold. If you ever played Might & Magic, Eye of the Beholder, Menzoberezzan or the newer Legend of Grimrock (which is gridbased unlike this one) you'll most likely adore this game.\n\nThis is a game for oldschool RPG players. It's stat-heavy, character development is exciting and fun, there is A LOT of combat and A LOT of loot, progression feels right and well paced, character voices are a blast, music is pretty atmospheric and nice, the world is a bit empty but looks decent for an oldschool cRPG and the 90's developer humour is a joy to behold (do check the manual as well for some quick laughs).\n\nThe amount of races (11) and classes (15) gives this game one of the most intriguing character creation schemes ever. It's bloody hard to settle on 6 characters only when they all sound very unique and interesting. The game lets you recruit two npc's at a time (RPC's) with their own benefits and limitations (some outright refuse to go to certain areas).  Once created the future development starts to intrigue you. You'll most likely end up in forums getting answers to a lot of questions in that regard. Which is quite nice. I learned half of this game by reading posts and figuring out different approaches.\n\nWhich is this game's strongest side IMO. There is no right or wrong way. It's how you wanna play it (for the most part). There is no such thing as an optimal party. It's what you want it to be. What suits your roleplaying and gameplay the best. And that's one of the reasons it's hard to become tired of this game. The amount of options, how many characters to run (1-6), where to go (semi-open world), what skills to emphasize developing, who you wanna recruit etc..... You most likely wanna try out every possible combination.\n\nThe game has a few bugs. Luckily the game uses rolling quicksaves so you can have 3 quicksaves at a time (at which point the first gets overwritten and so forth). And the combat can get really slow. I highly recommend using the monster movement speed mod: http://wolfie.wiz8.de/Wiz8Fast.html\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf you like oldschool, combat and stat heavy cRPG's you will get hooked on this one. I've seen people with ridiculous amount of time in this game. People who tried multiple playthroughs with different setups, 1 character iron man games, you name it.\n\nPersonally I have 300+ hours in the game (some off Steam) and have gotten around 15%-20% through the game then restarted to try out different parties and builds. This game will do that to you. I have rarely seen a starting zone (the Monastery) this many times in any cRPG I've ever played. And I love it.\n\nThe game has some quirky puzzles. Things you wouldn't expect or see coming. And the feeling of solving said puzzles leaves one with the satisfaction like no other. Back in the day people didn't go online to check walkthroughs but sticked with it and got the most rewarding feeling of figuring something out for themselves. This game has that sort of "achivement moments".\n\nIMHO this game, Fallout 1&2 and Arcanum is the best non-D&D cRPG to ever have been made. It's just that bloody good. Not the story, but the level of party customization, the mix of "improving through usage" and point distribution at level-up's, the witty voiceacting, the weird fantasy-scifi setting, the extremely tactical combat system (positioning is everything), the small tricks you pick up as you get better at the game etc....\n\nIt is simply brilliant. Let me recommend you this video to understand the importance of Wiz8 and the Wizardry series:\n\nSpoiler alert!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab08qIbo9e4","March 21","true","241.6"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","0"

The Wizardry series was a founding father of the RPG genre and many great franchises of today, including Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, and Might and Magic, drew significant inspiration from it.\n\nWizardry 8 takes the wide array of charachters and classes and challenging combat of its predecessors and places it into a new, for the series, 3D environment that, even after a decade, is still pleasing to the eye.\n\nWoven into this 3D world is a story line that is both unique and engaging. The story takes place on a classic medieval fantasy planet that is now host to a range of alien factions vying diplomatically and militarily for control over artificats that will grant godhood.\n\nThis story drives gameplay both at the tactical level, with your party members choosing between swords, spells, guns, and technology, and at the strategic level, as you decide who to ally with and who to oppose among 2 major factions and a host of minor players.\n\nThese choices affect gameplay in a way that puts modern AAA RPG developers to shame. Major choices set you on a road towards one of the game's various endings, but even these roads aren't set in stone as choices made with minor factions can alter your ultimate path.\n\nWhile I would be remiss in not recommending players new to the series try out Wizardry 6 and 7 first, the reality is that Wizardry 8, with its 3D environment and epic tale, stands head and shoulders above its predecessors and is perfectly enjoyable as a stand-alone experience.","September 11, 2013","true","0.0"," 27 of 39 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","27","39","0","2"

Those games are in a different category of coolness, but Wizardry 8 branches out and places a shadow over everything.\n\nHere are the reasons Wizardry 8 is the best RPG ever.\n\n*An uncanny amount of enemies in most fights, for an RPG of this kind. (You can have 30 or more monsters in a single battle.)\n\n*AoE spells are the best.\n\n*Every enemy EXPLODES or DISINTEGRATES on death. Nobody falls over and leaves a corpse. Cleaner world, cooler finishers.\n\n*This is one of those rare games with a class that can eventually learn every spell available, and that class can eventually one-shot the entire enemy lineup of 30 or more monsters. Bishop or bust, homes.\n\n*Monks will roflstomp everything.

I will say that flat and simple. It has the best replay value of all RPGs I have played, best party building system, best leveling system, and great and unique combat system too. THe only con I can think of is the graphics very much how its an old game. It is about a slight step up from N64 graphics is all, but damn the gameplay is good. It is a complex game, but very straight forward like chess. The rules of chess are easy to learn, but figuring out how you want to play and the best way to play are a whole other thing.\nThis game is worth $10. Ive got 25 hours right now and I'm still fighting with restarting and just trying out combinations of parties. I haven't even gotten 1/4 through thew game yet. I make progress fine, but I learn more about the enemies and flow of combat and think "Oh wait I can do that! ok I'm ganna make another party with that in mind now"\n\nYou can do almost anything you want too.

It is on its own, the last Wizardry game of the Dark Savant trilogy made by Sir-Tech as well as being the last within the official series (the license was given to game developers in Japan who made their own Wizardry games such as Tale of the Forsaken Land which have their own story and universe in comparison to that of 8).\n\nThe gameplay itself gives players either a turn-based approach or a more active but still turn-based take on combat. The game itself is a mixture of fantasy and sci-fi, pitting players against mundane enemies such as a human spell-caster and giant rats to more technological or magical enemies such as androids or demonic beast. Wizardry 8 offers a variety of customization to players based on the races and classes to choose from. This means one can play with a normal party such as a dwarf fighter, elf mage, and a human thief to something a bit more diverse such as Hobbit ninja's and Felpurr samurai's. Not only is there a variety in races (such as human, rawulf, dracon, mook, etc.) and classes to pick (such as bishop, priest, ninja, alchemist, etc.) but the game also offers a variety of equipment to use, each with their own advantages and restrictions.\n\nThe story of Wizardry pits the player's party against the forces of the Dark Savant for whatever reason (using an imported save where you went with an important NPC to Dominus, following a prophecy you'd first hear a bit from the Trynnie merchant, the game does have different intros based on what saves you use, be it imported saves from Wizardry 7 or using an entirely new party). Ultimately (without trying to spoil too much), the story would lead to players trying to gain a power that the Savant himself desires.\n\nThe only con to Wizardry 8 as far as I know is that trying to play it off Steam with a mod (only tried the Christian Coder mod) doesn't seem to work for some reason.\n\nIf you are a sort of person who is interested in playing a good CRPG that is worth the time and money spent, Wizardry 8 is one to go with.","March 4, 2015","true","42.2"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

It is certainly one of the best cRPGs of its time and, arguably, one of the best of all time.  All of the elements that made up a great game of this genre in the 2000s is here:  robust character creation, flexible party formation, plentiful combat, and addictive character progression.\n\nAs might be expected of a game its age, the graphics in Wizardry 8 are dated.  But, importantly, not cripplingly so.  Watching a freshly killed opponent explode and seeing their skull careen across the screen is just...timeless.  Unlike the graphics, the sound is still top notch.  The ambient environmental sounds, whether in a dungeon, jungle, or graveyard, do a very nice job of bringing some immersion to the game.\n\nWhile RP elements such as open world exploration and NPC interactions are light compared to the standards of today, the character creation and party formation system provides enough variety that you'll develop an affinity for the members of your party as you go along.  Stat and skill prgression is a fairly straightforward affair:  raise the tank's strength and stamina, raise the mage's intelligence, etc.  But what's nice is that it's not just leveling up that provides progress.  Using skills repeatedly also raises their scores.  So, yes, you can develop a mage that's awesome with a bow (given enough practice).  On top of such flexibility, progress actually feels like progress.  You can sense the improvement in your characters as they climb the godly ladder even as they face more difficult opponents.\n\nThe story is decent enough but, frankly, isn't likely to be the reason someone keeps playing the game.  That motivation will likely come from character/party development and....\n\nCombat.  This is truly a towering strength of the game.  It's plentiful and it requires adapting tactics to have any sort of long term success.  Fortunately, the game allows you to do just that.  The AI mobs can be surprisingly, and unforgivingly, clever.  Don't just stand in the middle of open ground...get your party's back against a wall to avoid being surrounded.  Guard that mage, because the mob's not going to charge headlong at the lady in plate armor with the big, pointy stick (unless you find a way to give them no alternative).  If the enemy has access to long range attacks, they will use them, so you better not sit back waiting for that fireball to explode in front of you.  There are even going to be situations in which your party is in over its head.  Retreat to fight another time.  Not every combat will provide a challenge, but just enough will to keep you on your toes.\n\nIn conclusion, while it has the drawbacks of age, Wizardry 8 still provides a great cRPG experience.  As I said in the short version above, if you like classic games of the genre, give this one a go, particularly if it goes on sale.","September 25, 2014","true","4.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

So far I have played on  "turn based" combat, although the game does allow continous combat (option in menu).

Trying to figure out the various classes that fit in with your style of gameplay while balancing them with the ability to survive. So many different combinations that you can have will make this game fun to replay or run multiply runs at the same time. The exictment of finding the various classes that works well together to give you a difficult time surviving while at the same time giving you pride. Or the various ways to play classes. Like a fire only mage, or a damaging priest and so forth. The classes has so many different ways that you are able to play them.\n\nWith all that going on you also have the going back to find stuff that you needed to go forwards to get. That and trying to remember where they were at the same time. Or if you forget to grab an item that you need later the trying time to figure out where it is, the hunt that you have for that one treasure that you needed. Getting the information from various NPC's or the notes that you have to find.\n\nAll of this combined with the option of a ironman mode where you can only save when you exit the game and once your party dies it is all over. This brings out the caution for those loved party members, while at the same time making sure that you don't bite off more then you can chew. Not being able to go back and take back those options you did that makes people hate you or attack you.\n\nThese various things in this game is a large part in why I would recommend this game to others. The long hours that you can spend on it along with the replay ability. The various difficulty with the option of Ironman to up the challenge.

I can see relations between Wizardry 8 and Morrowind (the first TES game involving Todd Howard in development) and it's really interesting. It seems like a Fallout/Morrowind/Daggerfall mixture with it's own touch. Only playing three hours, I've found this to be really addicting. When killing, it feels more rewarding than most RPG games that I've played. I really feel like character progression is more refined in this game, especially for it's time. The game to be honest, is pretty hard if you don't know what you're doing. Essentially trial/error is what you have to do if you don't watch gameplay or not know what you're doing. I've found having a priest, tank, ranger or two, and a bard is standard. Bard's lute helps out loads and having the extra ranger if you choose, helps in sticky situation when your spellcaster(s) and ranger can only attack the far-away enemy. Overall, this game is great, I'd definitely pay the full $10.00 if it wasn't on sale. It's worth it if you like RPG games.","December 25, 2013","true","26.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

You'll meet many incredible monsters, some easy to beat, some hard to beat, some even impossible to beat - (you might have to run from them).\n\nThe story is continued from its predecessors and now your party can even ascend and become gods (or cosmic lords, as the game calls it). Which is incredibly fun!\n\nSo it's not an easy game at all. It can be a challenge. And you can build your characters wrong so they may be useless in the endgame. But it's an incredibly rewarding game. For every new player, I'd recommend to make yourself familiar with the game on normal or easy settings, then go for the 3rd and highest difficulty for an amusing game where you'll sometimes have to run but where XP flows steadily and challenges come galore.\n\nJust for fun, I have started a speedrun to share my hundreds of hours I have played this game - not only on steam, but before too. I'm so happy about this version as my old DVDs didn't work with Windows 7 anymore.\n\nYou can read newbie tips about the game here: www.thoughtfulgaming.com - and you'll have access to my YouTube from there too.\nAnd there are, of course, many Playthroughs on YouTube for the game. Some of them really funny if new guys play it blindly. You will experience some of the fun if you buy and play this game just like that.\nAnd for the speedbumps, you can go to e.g. my blog and get some starting help :-)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2Z1dm3b5Ys","October 12, 2015","true","203.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The game is deep, and highly complicated throughout, and in the end all players begin to decide what classes and gameplay is 'the best'. The only thing that I have seen as a downside to this game's design is the fact that what you encounter, and the overall difficulty is as much dependant on luck as it is skill. Creatures actively hunt you down, and you can easily end up against odds you cannot possibly overcome, especially if you have decided to try to run from an encounter, instead of putting your back to a wall and fighting it out in hopes of surviving with at least a few members of your party alive. If you are the type who enjoys tabletop games such as D&D or Pathfinder, this came will likely tickle your fancy, but if you are looking for another Fable or even a Final Fantasy, or Skyrim, you may as well move on, as this game will only frustrate you.","July 3, 2014","true","43.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It kicks my ♥♥♥. It makes me cry. I still haven't beaten it because I keep trying new parties to see if I find that magic key that works for me.\n\nBut I really really enjoy it.\n\nOne of the biggest draw is the party creation, in which you get to select semi-animated character portraits and select from a variety of personality based voices. Your party members speak quite a lot, usually as a way to notify you of things that've happened or are happening in game, and it really makes your party feel real. Try getting to level 12 with a group and not care about all 6 of your party members for reasons other than tactics. If you can do it, you're heartless.\n\nThe other thing I love about it, is from the perspective of someone who hasn't completed everything yet, it's such an interesting world to explore. It's not quite what you expect and it always feels like there's more around the corner, and it's worth it to just spend some time cautiously poking around.\n\nAs a comparison to another game, Legends of Grimrock, I consider LoG a dumbed down half broken crappy version of Wizardry 8 with much prettier graphics.

The controls and graphics are fully acceptable by today's standards (though you may want to swap your cursor keys for WASD) and I've seen many modern mobile games look worse. The introduction basically tells you all you need to know about the Wizardry games that came before, so no need to play any other titles prior to this one.\n\nThe Wizardry series was hit and miss for me in the old days since it was one of the worst offenders in the "ecology of a dungeon" -- with rats and ninjas one step down a corridor from slimes ready to pounce you from total darkness. Wizardry 8 is much more realistic in that sense with slimes in rooms where it looks like they'd thrive, for example, although it still has some of the wacky characters and races more suited to science fiction than fantasy. I'm not sure how I feel about that aspect of the game - but this particular Wizardry seems less corny in that way.\n\nThe locations are varied and interesting, and the game makes you want to explore every nook and cranny rather than blow through it. Sometimes you will find little hidden items and clues, so the searching is worth it.\n\nThe gameplay is a hybrid between Castle Grimrock / Dungeon Master / Bard's Tale classic-style and 3D full-range movement CRPGs, and allows you to position your characters to the sides in your party formation. I have yet to decide if this works well (since while you can be flanked you cannot flank the enemy with your "blob), but it does add interest to how you form your party.\n\nIf you like dungeon crawls with inventory management, healing spells, and a casual tone (but with ample challenge), this one is a good use of your time.","June 7, 2015","true","8.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If you are saving manually, you had better put in multiple saves.\n\nThat being said, the reason why it's the best is because the story is different and interesting combined with the fact that you can ask anything in dialog and it's all voice acted -- I don't know of any other game that does this.

I've played Wiz8 a long time ago and now it's finally available on Steam.\nIt's not perfect, but it's damned close. It can be very difficult for a new player who never played Wiz series before.\nFor the first time in Wiz series you will see a completely 3D environment - game is still quite pretty for its age.\nPlayer can create a party and fully customize each party memeber (like class, skills etc ). Each character has its own dialogue, animated portrait, and unique voice tone. The characters and the way they interact with each of the NPCs have come a long way since Wiz7. Your personality, communication skills, and the way you and the NPCs view each other all determine what happens during a confrontation. You can talk by either typing in complete sentences (like: Where is XXX?), and also by selecting words from your already memorized ones.\nCombat system is very good IMO. Player can setup all party members in a formation that could be anything from *fighters in front and ranged characters behind* to a *fighters in the middle and casters on the sides*. Player can setup virtually any formation desired. Either way you will be able to change the way your party attacks/is attacked and do so on the fly, letting you devise a new formation during battle to adapt to the new combat situation.\nI highly recommend this game - it's difficult but very rewarding. It's definitely an underrated gem.","November 27, 2013","true","21.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I prefer to play this on Iron Man, Expert, because it's more fun to me that way -- in theory. In practice, what actually happens is that at some point the game crashes and corrupts your save, and then if it's Iron Man you're literally totally screwed, because you have to start over. If you are saving manually, you had better put in multiple saves.\n\nThat being said, the reason why it's the best is because the story is different and interesting combined with the fact that you can ask anything in dialog and it's all voice acted -- I don't know of any other game that does this. Tons of classes and races and combat can be complex and interesting. Everyone that plays this has their own opinion about what is best for a party, but they're all wrong -- only I know what is best (joke).

Your party crash-lands on the planet Dominus, and is soon confronted by the servants of the Dark Savant, who challenges you to retrieve the three artifacts: the Astral Dominae, the Destinae Dominus, and the Chaos Moliri, place them at Ascension Peak before the Dark Savant can ascend to Godhood.\n\nYou create a party of 6 characters (plus up to two hired guests) from 11 races, 15 classes. You can customize each character’s portrait, and assign them one of 18 voices. Or, you can import your save game from Wizardry VII, and continue the story.\n\nThis is what computer RPGs looked like before the genre was taken over by dungeon diggers (like the Diablo series) and single-character real-time RPGs (the Elder Scrolls series).\n\nPros:\n\n* Parts of the game have aged remarkably well—despite being made in 2001, it runs natively even on 1080p monitors and works with modern 3D video cards (despite its hilariously dated 3DFX logo on startup.)\n* Huge world, huge number of races, huge number of classes, multiple beginnings and endings make this a highly replayable game. I've been playing this game for literally years, and still haven't experienced all of the content in it.\n\nCons:\n\n* Random encounters can be badly-paced and repetitive. (Especially the plant monsters around Trynnie area, making even just moving from point A to point B a chore at times.\n* Lack of in-game help text makes the manual a necessity. (The manual is available on Steam; you might consider printing it out for reference.)\n* Alt-tabbing from the game can sometimes cause the game to lose keyboard control. (You can sometimes solve this by hitting alt-enter twice in a row.)\n\nThings Modern Gamers Might Have Issues With:\n\n* Difficult: even by 2001 standards, this was a difficult game, even on the “easy” setting.\n* Graphics: while the graphics engine can display at 1080p, the models aren’t any more detailed than they were in 2001. Some monsters (slimes and spiders) look very good even by modern standards, others (humans) look blocky.\n* Not all of the dialog is voiced.\n\nIf you’ve played and enjoyed any of the Ultima series, the Might and Magic series (before they became strategy games), or the modern indie game Legend of Grimrock, I think you’ll enjoy Wizardry VIII.","December 8, 2013","true","73.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Wizardry 8 has a more natural modern game feel to it but still is deeply rooted in turn-based tactical combat.   All three games offer a deeply satisfying amount of character customization coupled with a decent storyline and awesome setting.  Even if you don't enjoy the DOS games, starting a new game in Wizardry 8 is still very satisfying and the game does a decent enough job of introducing the storyline to the player.   (scoring is for wiz8) Gameplay: 9/10 Graphics: 6/10(but thats not what this game is all about) Storyline/Environments: 8.5/10 Overall 8/10.  Very much worth the money.

The game is aging but should appeal to old school gamers who remember the days when video games were about interesting game mechanics and not just having the latest and greatest graphics. The game is turn based, which should appeal to players who enjoy games from the time period the Wizardry series of games originally came out in. Sadly, it seems not many today know or remember Wizardry, but if you enjoy games with a lot of different mechanics you can utilize while not being required to use them to complete the game, and have a special place in your heart for retro games of an amazing caliber, Wizardry 8 has a lot to love.\n\nThe battle system is easy to learn but hard to master, yet once you are able to do so, you will feel like a true boss stomping over weaker enemies that gave you trouble before, while still weary and afraid of what new beastie may be lurking around the next corner. As far as the story and dialog goes, Wizardry 8 certainly has no problem seating itself into a more comical niche. At first glance, it may appear some of the  lines and plot are just corny and lame because of Wizardry 8's age, however, if one were to look closer, they may see that the game enjoys being campy, welcoming your eye rolling and snickering.\n\nEmbrace the silly dialog and goofy plot! Enjoy the in depth character creation and entertaining battle sequences! And if you find yourself afraid to venture forth to your next objective without going back and leveling some more, don't be ashmed! The world of Wizardry 8 can be rough and heartless, at times, but with your wit and your strength, you may yet complete your adventure!","July 4, 2014","true","17.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When Steam did the fall mega sale I just HAD to buy it. This is one of those RPG's that you have to play, yeah you can cry that it's old, or it's dated in many respects. But if you look beyond that it's a fun game, you can play this in so many different ways.\n\nYou start off with 6 adventures that you can customizes your self, all the way down to how they sound when they talk. From there you are cast in an adventure of a life time. The combat is turn based, and some of the spells are cool to aim around. There are all kinds of classes to pick from, and races to mess with... Oh and your rag tag team will talk to each other, it's kind of funny.\n\nPros - Mix and match classes and races, lovable chatter within your party, spells are fun to use and all areas of magic are useful in some respect, replayability is high if you don't mind starting over, ironman mode can make the game a real challenge.\n\nCons - Some monsters are hair-ripping frustrating to deal with, graphics are really dated, some races are useless, back-firing spells can be a problem, monsters auto-level with you.\n\nVerdict - Only get this game if you don't care about graphics and those auto-leveling monsters, I highly enjoy this game to no end.

I've played it for quite a while, and I haven't actually finished the storyline.\n\nGranted, the first time I played almost-through it, I had to reformat and forgot to back up my save, but I had no issues restarting and enjoying the quests all over again.  I got to just about the same point in the game, when I got distracted with other things, and so I haven't played lately.  I will likely be restarting again - not that I mind, because again, it is great fun.\n\nThere are a few things that will irk you when you play, either the limited resolution options, the lack of windowed mode, or what-have-you, but to me, it's all outweighed by how fun the game is.\n\nPros:\n-Create your own party with thousands of possibilities for customization.\n-Enjoy the storyline or free roam, play how you like.\n-Replay it again and again, find things you've missed or experience your favorite moments again.\n-Low price, plenty of play time.\n\nCons:\n-Occasionally a little difficult and/or frustrating\n-Spawning of enemies when you're trying to rest is a bit hard on the patience\n\nIf you're looking for a game that'll occupy you for hours, and you don't want to spend a lot of money?\n\nThis is one of the best.","September 12, 2013","true","163.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Wizardry 8 is SOOOO good. A deep, difficult old school experience that is completely worth the price and more.\n\nI remember ordering it directly from Sir-Tech years ago because it wasn't available in stores. The game was finished but the devs could'nt get a distributor, or something like that, so I ended up ordering it from them. It took a while but when I finally had my hands on a copy I played it to death but never actually finished it.\n\nThis little baby is HARD, make no mistake. Like Dark Souls hard in RPG form.\nA great story in a HUGE world filled with great characters, loot and the hardest mobs of critters you'll ever encounter. And just because you just beat a big swarm of 20+ wasps, don't think you're out of the woods because another one just like it could be right around the corner. Get your back against a wall, rest and move on. Yes, Rest and save. OFTEN.\n\nOffensive magic isn't too strong, but support magic can truly turn the tide of battle in your favour. Early spells like Web, Sleep and Terror will be essential in vanquishing large groups of enemies. Use the formation feature adequately, keep close to the walls to protct your mage and healer, and go to town.\n\nA fantastic experience that has aged very well, and a true blessing to get it on Steam.\n\n10/10!","December 14, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In Wizardry 8, Making your own characters is a blast. This game is full of interesting races like the Dracon, Mook and Rawulfs and classes like the the psionic, Bishop and Ninja; this is so refreshing compared to the generic human, elf, dwarf races and the fighter, mage and thief classes you see in most modern day RPGs. I also love how  the custom characters are brought to life with a variety of  wonderful voice actors and animated portraits that make your creation feel alive; I haven't felt this attached to characters in an RPG in a long time. I know many RPGs allow you to customize your characters appearance, but Wizardry 8’s character experience stands out to me; theres just something special about taking the time to craft  the whole cast of characters in your group, then crash landing them onto the planet and see how far they can go as a team. My only real complaint is that the combat seems a little drawn out compared to other rpgs (there are mods to speed it up but I haven't installed those yet) Of course the graphics might look dated (to be expected for a game this old), but Im having a blast playing this game so far with my crazy cast of comrades.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rabcor/recommended/245450/","rabcor","Easter Bunny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rabcor/","382 products in account","This game is gold! It's a piece of history! It's a godlike game. No rpg fan should miss this game. It can't be compared to any RPG i've ever played, but i like to compare it to FF7 because this is essentially the Western Game Equivalent of FF7. In my mind both games are equally epic and share the first place among my favorite RPGs of all time. (2nd place goes to morrowind and 3rd place goes to Dark Souls, gives me a nice and even amount of Asian and Western games in my top 3. since my top 3 is essentially 4.)\n\nThe game has the most perfect, smooth turn based combat system i have ever experienced in a game. Truly masterful, and fun!\n\nIt has one of the most fun Character Creation systems in gaming since you can make up to 6 characters for a single playthrough.\n\nIt's soundtrack is perfect.\n\nIt's setting is perfect. A mix of sci-fi and dark medieval fantasy.\n\nI almost jumped out of my chair when i saw it brought to steam, and didn't hesitate for 1 second to buy it again (also got 6 and 7 because i'd like to play this games predecessors)\n\nFor a personal rating lets see.\n\nOverall 9.5/10 (All things considered. that's what i'd rate it as, very close to perfect)\n-\nGraphics (For it's time) 10/10 (Perfection)\n-\nGraphics (For now) 5/10 (still enjoyable to an extent)\n-\nGameplay 10/10 (Obviously i think that, i can't describe it in brief either. It just is.)\n-\nSoundtrack 10/10 (It does everything a soundtrack is meant to do, and does so well.)\n-\nVoice Acting 9/10 (Very solid voice acting. And yes pretty much every npc is voiced)\n-\nControls 8/10 (You can survive this game using only the mouse, except for dialog boxes where you need to type. You will get used to the controls very fast but that does not make them good, however you will not use most keyboard shortcut functions i suspect. only keyboard for movement and mouse for combat, but if you learn to use the keyboard shortcuts for combat it can be a great asset to speed up your fights)\n-\nWorld (Layout) 8/10 (It is very open and unexplored at first, but once explored once, it usually wont show you anything new except maybe a chest you didn't notice before or something like that. Also for an open world game, the maps in it are surprisingly linear, this is not bad however. It helps you know where you can go to continue)\n-\nStory 8/10 (I have not finished it yet because i just wasn't up for that difficult task. But from what i have seen, it's story is quite good, good enough to get you immersed in it. But it doesn't hold anything new that i hadn't seen before unless maybe the end which is unseen by me. I feel the 8 does it justice.)\n-\nHardcoreness 10/10 (Think, Dark/Demon souls or Witcher as examples of hardcore modern rpgs. This game stays very true to being an RPG, It's got difficult fights and a learning curve. (For example mob spawns are mostly not levelled like in most modern games) It's very dark fantasy which in itself is a part of being hardcore. The game has every bit of hardcore Witcher or Dark souls offered me and much more.)\n-\nFun 9/10 (I really love making characters and custom teams in the game (or any other), it's a huge part of my love for it. Then once in game i love progressing and leveling up, it feels like so much happens, but levelling gets very slow after a certain point at which you've still got ways to go to finish the game. The only thing that dropped the fun from 10 to 9 was that i've felt the need to grind for levels in the game occasionally. But this in itself is reasonably fun sincei ti s challenging)\n-\nValue 10+/10 (Yes i'm saying that this title i wouldn't have hesitated to buy for 30$ today. and in it's own time i didn't hesitate to buy it for like 50~ish. This game has as the trailer stated roughly 200+ hours worth of gameplay. You're not gonna miss your money, it tastes better than any hamburger, it gives you more fun than any movie ever could. Look at all the awards the game has!)\n\nConclusion: Masterpiece\n\nIf you like RPGs, buy this and play this without even thinking twice. Kudos to Night Dive Studios for bringing the best titles back from the dead!","September 12, 2013","true","4.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The character customization, combat, magic system and difficulty set this game apart from most others and it has some pretty solid music tracks to set stage for epic battles. A multitude of races that all have their unique strengths and weaknesses along with a great selection of classes that all rely on seven primary attributes (strength, intelligence, willpower, endurance, dexterity, speed and senses) which somehow all manage to be relevant at least in some way to every class.\n\nOne of my favourite things about this game is that you can make up a party of 6 adventurers from scratch and by the time you are done, they all have personality. One thing of note about this game is the amount of lines of voiced dialogue from you party members.In any given battle they will be shouting out about being hurt, landing killing blows or getting poisoned and the like that really immerse the player in what is going on in the battle, all the while doing so in the personality of the voiceset you picked. While this may not seem new, the sheer amount of things they will comment on gives enough variety so it always seems to add to the situation instead of being repetative annoying drivel. MANY games have attempted to give the freedom of character creation and maintain a level of personality and have failed. This game does not, and considering it has some of the most in-depth of its kind that is fairly amusing.\n\nThe only thing about this game that hasn't held up well over time is the greatly outdated first gen 3d graphics and a mediocore story (mostly due to limited interactive npcs). This game is BEGGING for a remake/facelift and someone would stand to make a LOT of cash in doing so.","July 2, 2014","true","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Over and over again. In the rare cases where another party member were getting injured too much, I had to throw a couple of healing spell and done. Then sleep, and repeat.\n\nThere's almost nothing to do during the combat : we mostly spend time looking the combat log & waiting for the round to play out, only quickly setting a spell now and then.\n\nI can't imagine anyone who played more recent & evolved RPGs to enjoy this one. I do see the hypnotizing effect of staring at the combat log, but I don't think it's a nice way to spend the little time we are allowed on this planet... :)\n\nPros :- a lot of classes with a lot customization\n\nCons :- awful visual, with a colorblind art director (even in 2001, it was subpar)\n- the party members repeat the same sentences over & over\n- basic, repetitive & slow combats with minimal required input on our part to beat the hardest difficulty level\n- exploration to a bare minimum, with nearly no interest\n- slow to move around, especially when staring at long empty corridors\n- my mage killed more mobs than the 5 other party members combined\n- more than 60% of the attacks (except the spells) end being a miss or without any damage (who thought it'd be something exciting ?!?)\n\nBonus Note :If you want to give a try anyway, at least boost the combat speed and once you'll be familiar with everything, look for a little tool to speed it up even more : http://steamcommunity.com/app/245450/discussions/0/846965056744779633/ .","April 1","false","6.9"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","0"

Especially for being a game that was released 15 years ago, by a developer that shut down right after it's release.\n\nIt's kind of like if you took the original Everquest engine, added actual questing, made gameplay turn-based like the old school RPGs, but with an open world to explore, and decent voice acting. That's this game. The story continues from Wizardry 7, which was release eons ago. Which was also a direct follow - up to Wizardry 6. The entire trilogy spans well over 25 years which is insane for a video game (well minus Super Mario and all of course).\n\nI'll end this by saying, this is the game that Might & Magic 9 wished it could have been. And who ever has the Wizardry license now, need to take notes from this game... not that damn Anime ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they made of Wizardry Online.

This will be a turn off for some (felt as a grind) and a sweet joy for others. You can like the story or not but the fact is that you will spend most of the time in this game doing combat using a very special first person turn based system. Combat takes place in the same first person world view as exploration when enemies spot you and are close enough or when you decide to turn on combat mode. At first, it is difficult to understand the combat system and how it works, but once you get the hang of it (or read the manual) it is truly amazing. Turns are simultaneous, meaning you first choose an action for each of your characters (or keep the default one), then click "end turn" and see what happens (both your party and enemies will act according to their initiative, some actions may be cancelled or become useless depending on what happens and when). In first person view you never see your characters in 3D but there's a combat formation pane to position your group of characters (you can change during combat as well costing a turn to involved characters): it affects which enemies you can reach in melee depending on your weapon and the position of the enemies, and vice-versa. You can also move the whole group during a combat turn but it can prevent some characters to act for this turn. Positioning does matter in this game, and it's not at all like a simple turn based rpg where you just choose an action and a target for each character one at a time. There are also AoE items and spells, you can choose spell levels at your own risks (a spell may frizzle or even backfire if you're not skilled enough, on the other hand you can always choose a lvl 1 version of a spell for lower mana cost and safe results).\n\nThere is also the characters creation system with A LOT of races and classes to choose from, more than any other RPG I know. You can make a party of 6 characters or less (plus there are 2 guest slots reserved for story NPCs). The levelup and skill systems are great. Once you have enough XP, you levelup your characters when you want outside combat (you can pile up levels even): you invest points on stats and skills and spells, separately (each have their own points so you don't have to sacrifice one for the other). Your skills and spells also improve by using them (in and out of combat).\nImproving your characters is a real pleasure in this game and it feels very rewarding, never limiting or frustrating.\n\nHonestly, I'm still looking for another game with these features and I don't find it. Plus the way your characters portrait talk and react to things in and out of combat really gives personality to the adventure (without cut scenes and long dialogues). You even choose your character's portrait, personalities and voices for various hilarious results (and you can change those anytime during your adventure).","May 23, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I sadly have spent around 400 hours collectively on the 3 - Wizardry 6,7 and 8. Without guides it would have taken a LOT longer probably. I can't believe I didn't play them the first time round. Having completed all the greats, this definitely ranks up there, if not at the top. I am used to the frustrations having played many hours through the bards tale series etc. before the internet and guides even existed. I can understand if you are not used to the 'old' systems (like spending ages trying to sort inventories in Wizardry 6) but if you get past the quirks (which to me make it more enjoyable - sad as that is) then the series is second to none.","February 9, 2015","true","223.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, it is ultimately crippled by tedious combat mechanics. It is still weird enough for me to recommend it, but with the caution that it is best suited for gamers who can view this boring combat as a form of meta-challenge; I do not, and I did not continue.\n\nFor old-school fans, there is fun to be had in the kooky character background and class options, the stat-tweaking galore, the deep party-building, the non-linear play with many story options, and the offbeat NPCs. The voice acting is quite good and it all makes up in novelty what it lacks in graphics.\n\nThere is not fun to be had in the combat. The turn-based combat is not difficult in any engaging, strategic sense. It is simply slow and boring, even with a continuous-combat option. A single combat can easily last over 10 minutes of hack-slash-repeat. Much of this is because the game predominatly uses large groups of monsters, each moving in turn-based fashion. Other factors slow it further. AOE magic is typically quite low-damage; there is good CC, but never any quick mass-kills to clean house and move on. Your party has to move constantly, again in turn-based fashion, into extremely close range to hit with melee weapons, while enemies inexplicably do not. You cannot disengage from combat by running away or having enemies run from you; so if you Terror the enemy, you may have to wait a long time for them to return while you sit there, turn by turn. And there are many unavoidable fights, especially as creatures respawn in narrow roads, tunnels, etc.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the rest of the game and explored five major areas of it. But I finally gave up on this one night after an hour of gaming that consisted of walking about 1/4 mile on a road, and engaging in three unchallenging combats and one NPC conversation. The convo was about 5 minutes, the walking less than that. Do the math on how tedious the combat is. And looking down the road, I saw yet another mega-mob coming...

However, it is ultimately crippled by tedious combat mechanics. It is still weird enough for me to recommend it, but with the caution that it is best suited for gamers who can view this boring combat as a form of meta-challenge; I do not, and I did not continue.\n\nFor old-school fans, there is fun to be had in the kooky character background and class options, the stat-tweaking galore, the deep party-building, the non-linear play with many story options, and the offbeat NPCs. The voice acting is quite good and it all makes up in novelty what it lacks in graphics.\n\nThere is not fun to be had in the combat. The turn-based combat is not difficult in any engaging, strategic sense. It is simply slow and boring, even with a continuous-combat option. A single combat can easily last over 10 minutes of hack-slash-repeat. Much of this is because the game predominatly uses large groups of monsters, each moving in turn-based fashion. Other factors slow it further. AOE magic is typically quite low-damage; there is good CC, but never any quick mass-kills to clean house and move on. Your party has to move constantly, again in turn-based fashion, into extremely close range to hit with melee weapons, while enemies inexplicably do not. You cannot disengage from combat by running away or having enemies run from you; so if you Terror the enemy, you may have to wait a long time for them to return while you sit there, turn by turn. And there are many unavoidable fights, especially as creatures respawn in narrow roads, tunnels, etc.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the rest of the game and explored five major areas of it. But I finally gave up on this one night after an hour of gaming that consisted of walking about 1/4 mile on a road, and engaging in three unchallenging combats and one NPC conversation. The convo was about 5 minutes, the walking less than that. Do the math on how tedious the combat is. And looking down the road, I saw yet another mega-mob coming... No thanks.","July 24, 2015","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ultima, wizardry, zork, castle wolfenstien, doom! This game was great when I first played it many many years ago and having re-played it not to long ago, I can say that it is still very fun, challenging, with plenty to keep you at you PC all hours of the night. If you have a soft spot for the old days and want to take a 300+ hr down memory lane, then for the price of a value meal you can pick this up and re-live the good old days. For the price, pleasure, and playability, I rate this as on of the best games all time. Solid 10","May 6","true","212.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I feel, already, like I could play through this game like three more times and not get bored of making new setups to take through the game. The personality system gives characters breath, and as silly-on-purpose as the plot is, it's an amusing, relaxing, balanced RPG that I'm glad I picked up. (Also, unlike most games like it, you can totally learn how to play wiz8 just by /playing/ it, not reading that stinkin' manual first)","May 4","true","65.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a pretty great game in terms of plot, dialogue, loot, action, and the whole CRPG package.   It doesn't feel dated, even though it is, which is a bonus in my book.  It gets a knock off for having no tutorial - it took me more than half the game to learn how to move and to inspect traps - and a half a knock for turn based combat that sometimes goes on too long due to the sheer number of mobs/npcs involved or it initiates five times while you're three feet from the door and just want to go inside.  (At one point, I left the combat running while I made and ate lunch and when I returned, combat was still going.)  Otherwise, I recommend it for people who enjoy story-based RPGs.\n\nPros:\n-Story\n-Music\n-Characters\n-Loot\n-Plenty of walkthrough/advice webpages still around\n-Graphics don't seem dated even though they are\n\nCons:\n-No tutorial\n-Combat sometimes make you cry from length","May 2","true","73.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
