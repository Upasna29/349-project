Some of the levels can be challenging, others can be really easy, but most of all, they also have monsters you have to deal with. If you're planning to 100% this game, then completing the levels would take you a couple of hours at the most, depending on what pace you're taking.\n\nGenerally, most, if not all levels take place in the middle of an ocean, containing a lot of islands. You as a player has a pogostick and you use that to manuever through obstacles and get to the other islands in order to get to point B. You also can have another option to switch out your pogostick to a "gun" used to take out the monsters that get in your way.\n\nBut beware that you can die in this game. Since you're in the middle of the ocean, you can fall and drown in the water so you can expect to die like this when you failed a level. You can also die by the monsters, but you get multiple chances based on what difficulty setting you are in. If you die during a level, you go back to the beginning of the level and there are no checkpoints so you only have one shot.\n\nPongo also has 2 difficulties, easy and hard mode.In easy mode, you get three lives which affects how many hits the monsters can hit you and you gain control in the air, which basically means you can still move around while in the air.\nIn hard mode, you only have one life so you can't let any of the monsters hit you and you no longer gain control in the air, which means that you can only move in one direction continuously while in the air. This is only for players who want a bit more of a challenge.\nBut it doesn't really matter what mode you take as you don't get any achievements regarding these modes anyway.\n\nThe level designs are really bland. They don't seem very interesting and it feels the same every level you complete and they don't feel different whatsoever. The textures are plain and very boring to look at. Some of the levels get very repetitive and you will be bored playing this if you're not planning to get the achievements.\n\nAlthough I like the music, most of them are overused.I always hear this kind of music on Youtube, especially ones by Kevin Macleod. There should be more custom, creative music for this game to make it more unique, rather than putting in royalty-free music since to me they don't really make sense when putting it in a game like this.\n\nOh and I forgot to mention that there are badges and trading cards, so you can "play" this game for the trading cards and you don't have to play it again.\n\nShould you buy this game?If you're looking for a cheap game, wanting to craft badges from the trading cards, or just wanting to play the game for more easy achievements, then yes. Otherwise, don't get this game.\n\n4/10","October 16, 2015","false","15.5"," 49 of 60 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","49","60","0","1"

Progress through the game and you will be confronted with new enemies, bosses and traps along with basic puzzle elements. Most were quite simple and more a matter of finding the item required to pass that area. Power-ups included rapid-fire for your weapon and boosts to pogo speed and jump heights.\n\nPongo is lighthearted and enjoyable enough but it's tough to recommend at full price. Enemies were colourful and quirky though levels seemed a little repetitive and didn't change colour schemes at all. Sometimes islands with power-ups were placed so far away from the objective the 10sec timer would expire before you could actually use them which seemed a bit pointless. Controls felt like they could be more responsive, often I found my self drinking ocean water instead of launching into the heavens but probably more issues with my throwaway keyboard to blame. Gamepad support unfortunately wasn't included at all.\n\nSounds all bad but I'll upvote the game as there is still fun to be had in the lovelyplanet-esque world. Just feels expensive for what's currently offered and personally didn't feel the urge to continue onward, some collectible items may have helped as a side objective. Would recommend waiting out a price drop or further tweaks to the game. Some ideas and a gameplay video are below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK3eMaVtn_4\n@Devs\nNew colour schemes for later levels. Music should loop less and be reactive to what is on-screen. Tighten up the controls along with adding pad support. Leaderboards given the game is designed for speedrunning and it might be worth seeing if level editor + workshop support is viable. Achievements+trading cards never hurts either. Cheers :)","May 13, 2015","true","7.9"," 40 of 56 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","40","56","4","6"

The trailer reminded me of Lovely Planet, which I really enjoyed. There are a few issues with this game that push it into the 'not recommended' category for me.\n\nThe pogo mechanic is interesting, but it's clunky to charge up the jumps and time it just right when you're right at the edge of a platform. This isn't a huge deal in most levels because you have enough space to make it, but in a few levels (like 1-22) there is very little room for error as far as having max charge and jumping at the very edge of the platform.\n\nMoving platforms are horrible. You lose momentum when jumping and it's very hard to time it correctly. Also, there is no visible way to tell where a platform is going to change direction, so with faster moving platforms, you end up in the wrong place or it throws you off the edge.\n\nLevel design is boring with long sections of running straight with larger islands connected by the aforementioned moving platforms. Enemies are no threat whatsoever and you can run past all of them, but the few times you are forced to fight, you quickly find out that combat is also terrible because you can't strafe fast enough to outrun things.\n\nThis game has a lot of potential and I'd love to see some thoughtfully designed levels in the future. I had a lot of fun with the speed power-up and I'd love to see some maps designed around it. I would also love it if you removed the running button and just made that the default move speed. Having the sprint key toggle off on you because you slowed down too much makes platforming annoying and unpredictable and having to hold shift to avoid that makes my hand tired.\n\nIf some of the issues are fixed, I would be happy to change this to recommended, but as is, I can't suggest that anyone spend $8 for this.","June 29, 2015","false","10.5"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","20","27","0","0"

Pretty easy to get, too.  A good title for achievement hunters.\n\nThis game reminded me of my experience with Woodle Tree Adventure.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/369000/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Pongo is a really nice idea, but very bladly executed. It's simply bad in too many ways. Level design is almost non-existant, the art-style actively goes against the gameplay, the combat is not only unnecessary, but also badly designed, and even the physics' system is artificial in a way that, again, hinders gameplay.\n\nI'll explain what I like about it first, and then go quickly over all of the negatives mentioned.\n\nI really like this idea! I've original, and it could have led to some really interesting platforming sections! And I don't dislike the way it was implemented: as in, you have 3 Modes: a shooting mode, where you can't use the pogo to jump; a normal mode, where you charge the jump and then jump, and a true pogo mode, where you automatically jump when you hit the ground. It's a bit clunky, especially with the transitions between them, but over all, it's pretty cool.\nA really annoying thing was how there's absolutely no difference between the pogo and the true pogo mode, visually... They look and sound exactly the same. This means that you may expect to be in a certain mode, but realize that you're not, dying as a result... There should definitely be some feedback...\n\nThat's about it, really.\n\nWhy do I say the level design is non-existent? Well, there are 50 or so levels. BUT, only 2 are memorable. And they're memorable for their gimmicky way. It could have been a very nicely used gimmick, but no. The developers were simply like: "Hey, look at this cool level design!", but the levels provide absolutely no challenge, and remain an idea in a vacuum...\nThe game is only mildly fun when you try to """speedrun""" it. And I'm intentionally using those many quotation marks. Speedrunning, which seemed the perfect direction for the game, only works as in: run without stopping to kill anything, and pray that the level is timed accordingly. Some levels are. Others aren't. There are moving platforms that take up to 20 seconds to complete their cycle. It's really fun to wait for them.\n\nThen, there's the fact that there is almost no variation. Sometimes a new obstacle appears, but they're not used intelligently or anything. They're just there.\n\nThere's also the mind-boggling fact that they levels sometimes have these "sidepaths" or new islands to the side. These serve absolutely no purpose. None. At all. They're just there. Is it to trick the player? Some even have power-ups, that vanish within 10 seconds, making them worthless. I don't understand. There are no collectibles in the game, no story, nothing... Why are these even there?\n\nThen, there are some challenging jumps. These are really annoying. Why? Well, the levels are arranged in hexagons, for some reason. Meaning that you'll having to aim for the outer points of the hexagonal platforms. And jump out of them as well. You'll also have to time it perfectly, otherwise you'll miss and fall to your death.\n\nThe other problems are dependent on other systems. The graphic style, for example. It's cute. It looks like a pretty nice, low cost way of creating a game. But not of this type! There's zero perspective on depth. The colors have no shades or anything for one to gauge where the platforms are. So, half of the time, you'll time jumps inappropriately, because you couldn't see how far the platform was.\n\nTo make matters worse, the moving platforms are timed never to top. And they change direction at the absolutely farthest point that you can still jump on them. (An awkward way of phrasing it, sorry!) It's possible to jump on those platforms, but it's precision for the sake of it.\n\nThere are a few levels like this, those being very frustrating. It's not interesting design is any way.\n\nIt also pairs very badly with the levels' length. They usually take 50 seconds (short-ish ones), with some taking up to 2 minutes. 90% of the hard levels aren't hard. They're mostly running forward, or doing a couple of short, easy jumps. Until you reach the hard jump. They're a time waster. And they'll extend the gametime by a lot...\n\nWhat's wrong about the combat? Lack of feedback. The lives are on the corner, not standing out. But that's not the big problem. What is? The fact that there's no visual indication of when you hit. And even the sound doesn't play properly. It's barely noticeable!\nThen, the enemies' attack animations are in no way connected with you taking damage... you take damage at an arbitrary time, even without playing the animation... it's pointless.\n\nBut hey, you can simply evade all of the combat without a worry. They're too slow to pursue you, and so are bullets. It's really a completely pointless "feature". It makes the game slower without any benefit.\n\n\nFinally, the physics. On a basic level, they're solid. The game is a bit too slow, but other than that, it's satisfying to jump and run, when you nail it. The problem comes with the moving platforms. The developers had no concept of momentum. So, if you jump out of a moving platform, it will be as if the platform wasn't moving. That's really weird. It feels very, very wrong, and will totally destroy your timing.\n\nEven worse, is how artificial they've made the player stay still in a moving platform, since momentum is non-existant. I'm pretty sure it's a simply check of "if the player is exactly on the platform, his base speed in the same as the platform". Why am I sure? Because the game has some environmental pieces: small rocks, and destroyable nubs. These would serve very little purpose, being there just to provide some variety. However, if you step on a rock in a moving platform, you will NOT move with the platform. The platform will move without you, and then you'll most likely fall. See where the momentum would have played a very important role? These things happen a lot. And they just make the game feel incomplete and amateur. And still being sold for 10$... It's irritates me, honestly.\n\nIn a physics based game, at least study physics a bit more... especially when it negatively affects your game.\n\n\nThe interface is generally bad as well, not giving you good information when you need it, and so on. I won't dwell on that, since it's not too important.\n\n\nOverall, the game had some potential. But the fact that the level design is so uninspired, and even "broken" in some sections make the game really bad. It's unfortunate. 50 levels that are mostly filler do not, in any way, justify the price. And it's a real shame, since I really like the idea.\n\nI almost forgot one thing! The power-ups. There are 3: rapid fire, high jump, faster running. The first two are useless... The high jump is useful, but only in very, very specific obstacles and don't play a role in the general game.\nThe speed one, however, is really, really fun! The game is slow paced, making timing more controlled and important (not in a good way), but the speed power up changes a lot. The game suddenly becomes fast paced, making you time jumps while in the air, trying to traverse the levels quickly and in a risky way. It's great! Unfortunately, it's only used is a few levels, and never an explored machanic. Makes it feel like the developers didn't really try and see where the fun in their game was... Oh well.\n\nIf there is a revamping of the game, please, please, make it faster, and more interesting!\n\n\n\n\nAh, one last thing. The game has 5 music tracks. Some are nice. But they have no solid connection to each other, and they just play... one after another. It's like you having your own 5 tracks in Winamp, on the background. They just repeat, one after another... What's the point? Just goes to show how little thought went into the game. It's kind of sad, sometimes. I'd like to think that when someone makes a game, he would think of the experience as a whole, and try to make every aspect interesting... and then I look at Steam and I get disappointed.","July 10, 2015","false","6.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hopscotch007/recommended/369000/","hopscotch007","Hopscotch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hopscotch007/","313 products in account","Pongo! is a game about life. There are ups, downs and lots of geometric shapes that want to kill you for no adequately explained reason. Just as in real life, the best way through Pongo! is on a pogo stick, in fact, it is the only way. Luckily for you this game embodies the true American value of making sure everything in your possession also doubles as some sort of firearm so you can use your trusty stick to shoot down those dangerous coloured shapes.\n\nThere is a large gamut of challenging puzzles such as jumping on platforms, jumping on moving platforms, realising that the speed powerup continues to apply for as long as you are sprinting, jumping on platforms with trees on them, jumping on moving platforms with trees on them, figuring out you need to jump on a rock and use the bounce button, getting hit by enemies, branching pathways that don’t make a difference, branching pathways where one way leads to a dead end and of course the controls.\n\nIn addition to the puzzling challenges there is also a wide variety of enemies that appear throughout the game such as: Shooty Cube, Punchy Cube, Inanimate Cube, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Cheating Butterfly ♥♥♥♥, Helicopter Arms Easter Egg, Big Orange Kite and The Bounce Button.\n\nAll that said this was a pretty fun game and also a great streaming experience. 7 sproings / 13 pongos\n\nSome notes to the dev if you are reading this:\nPlease for the love of god add a sound effect for when I deal damage to the enemies. I spent like the first hour of my play time thinking the hitbox for the punchy cubes were broken because they inexplicably take 3 hits to kill and there isn’t any indication that you are hurting them when the bullets connect. It was particularly bad for the first boss, I spent a lot of time shooting before I eventually found the super jump powerup and got away and then I think he blew up? Still not really sure what happened there.\n\nIt’s also a bit confusing as the levels are numbered 1 to 50 in the level select but in the menu in game are named as level 1-1 to 1-50. Does it go up to 50-50?\n\nOne of the songs either at the end or beginning (or perhaps that’s just the game taking its sweet time to load that one in particular) has a massive gap of silence. I personally really liked the actiony piece of music and didn’t really care for the two others (did I mention there is only 3 songs in this game, and they just cycle through like a playlist, it probably would have been better if they picked one of the 3 songs for each level and just looped it) although the whimsical one really did suit the tone of the game.\n","December 19, 2015","true","6.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","63","5","8","7","1"

If you're curious how an FPS/platformer would play, if you needed to charge up every jump before you could use it, this will show you.  To me, that was worth around a quarter on sale.

The levels are pretty fun, but there are some drawbacks. The pogo mechanic is kinda weird and hard to get used to at first, but once you get used to it it's no problem. The mouse is overly sensitive and it's hard to aim at times, but you can also get used to it after a while. The main drawback is the levels can be pretty difficult, since there are no checkpoints and there are enemies everywhere once you get far enough. But other than that, I'd say that this game is pretty good, for 24 cents. Personally the most I'd pay for it is $1, so I'd only recommend this game when it's on sale, and if you like difficult first person platformers.","September 6, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game... isn't anything overly special. The art looks like MS paint but the game, it is challenging. THe biggest issue I think I have with this game is that the controls and movement feels a bit slippery.  The puzzles overall are mostly the same but what can you expect from a pogostick platform jumping game. The price, it isn't too bad though if you are expecting an epic game... don't bother. The game is fun for a bit but does get boring.\n\nOverall, I think I would recommend this game but very cautiously. If you can get it on sale, you should really get your monies worth but don't come into this game expecting it to be an epic adventure. It is a more casual game that is good for killing time and when you are really bored.","September 1, 2015","true","2.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Neverwinter is no exception. This game happens to be run by a Chinese corporation called Perfect World Entertainment. It is their "North American" division of Perfect World.\n\nThe big issues brought up by many North American and EU players is Pay2Win. Something that is rampant and very accepted and acceptable in Chinese, Korean, and SEA cultures among PC games. Neverwinter is an attempt to get away from some prevalent Pay2Win features otherwise present in their Chinese counter-parts and to a degree, has almost found a acceptable amount for NA players in their action games, such as Blacklight Retribution and especially Tourchlight. But these are exceptions to the rule, and they are not MMOs.\n\nNeverwinter does have Pay2Win aspects, make no mistakes. Without paying any cash, it will require a player months to be on equal footing compare to what a paying customer can achieve in a week or two if they take their time.\n\nThese aren't the things I personally have an issue with the game though. Because, with the exception of the price of coalescent wards constantly on the rise, an item required to craft high level weapon and armor enchants, most things a player can attain in a few months play, if their okay with settling for rank 7 and 8, maybe rank 9 enchants, instead of rank 10s.\n\nThe issue I have with PWE is that forum discussions about the game among players almost exclusively happens on their official forums, which are heavily censored. Not surprising coming from a corporation that formed in Beijing, outside of China's Special Economic Zone(SEZ), their quasi-capitalist zones. Even though these areas aren't officially ran as communist zones, their strongest political party remains the communist party, and many North American and EU peoples would be unable to differentiate between the two because their are so many similarities to a full communist ran country.\n\n--\n\nWhenever yo","February 26","true","3.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","45","5","11","4","0"

But does it have any effect?\nThere is a Mouse Sensitivity. (0-10)\nThere is a music and sound volume bar and you are able to change this between 0 and 10.\nYou can't change the music.\n\nAbout the game.\nYou are some Weird graphical lined guy on a Pong-Stick. You have to jump on platforms and sometimes killing enemies and eventually reaching the Exit. There are no checkpoints so one hit is death and you will have to restart the entire level over again. You don't have to kill every enemy to complete a level. Just reach the goal and ur done. That's it.\n\nThe most laziest developer i have seen so far to make platform games.\nThere are some Power-ups but not really worth it unless this is a requirement.\nEasy and hard mode. Game is already hard enough.\nGraphics is bad.\nThere are only a few music tracks and they are bad and ripped.\nBad controls and gameplay.\nIdea is nice but the execution is soo bad.\n\n\nOther things.\nThey got STOLEN MUSIC.  Music like from "12 labours of Hercules". (i believe every music is stolen in this game, since the music is too different from each other).\n\nSteam cards and this game are not worth it. Don't buy them otherwise he benefits from it.\n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 2/10\n","May 4","false","4.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You start out Pongo on a floating island and your goal is to jump across a string of floating islands untill you reach the end, while you are doing this there are also enemies that will try and kill you(they look rediculous btw). The entire game looks scetchy, its harder to see in the screenshots but the outsides of textures have like a thin wire around them.

Hop from island to island while avoiding enemies and collecting power ups.\n\nThe actual gameplay is a considerable failure.  Because the level design doesn't require the use of smaller jumps it's always better to go for max height.  This is at odds with the jump power bar's inherited uncertainty of how much of a jump you'll get.\n\nEnemies in the game can be shot with your pogo gun but it's faster and simpler to just rush to the exit and ignore everything else.

Challenging, unique, it was everything I hoped it would be. Some other titles might carry this idea of a 3D platformer, but I think that Pongo does it right. One thing that I think would make this game a lot more replayable, is the ability to make your own maps and post them up for other people to download and play. That would be a really good addition that could add so much more to the game.\n\nOtherwise, it's a great game that I really enjoyed.

Certain music tracks are incredibly awful, but for the most part the music compliments the gameplay.\n\nThe main pogo stick mechanic is implemented very well, and I personally havn't plaid any game with movement like this. My favorite thing to do in the game is collect the bounce power-up, climb to the highest point in the level, and bounce as high as I can and turn on bounce mode (which retains your jump hieght) and bounce like a meniac to the end of the level.\n\nThe game's biggest weaknesses are the enemies, poor collisions, and one or two bad music tracks. The enemies provide no threat but at least you're not required to kill them (because combat is kinda boring) . Somtimes you'll hit the side of a platform and get suspended in air and then gradually slide off. And like I said there are a few really bad music tracks, but for the most part it's ok.\n\nAll in all, the platforming is fun and the game is cheap.

Pongo is fun.\n\nSeriously though this game isn't a hidden gem, it has a crap load of issues. Akward controls mixed with first-person platforming? Check. Faulty level geometry collission and power-ups that have no pick-up hitbox meaning that you can't use them? Check. Bland visuals? Check. Royalty free, stock BGM that doesn't loop or transition properly? You betcha.\n\nHowever despite all of these really blatant and intrusive flaws I managed to find enjoyment in this game. Something about beating a level with a jump that seems nigh-impossible because of how unreliable the collision and controls felt so massively satisfying. Like when I got stuck on a single level for probably an hour because of one jump that required precision timing and a passionate prayer to every god, goddess, and spiritual being known and unknown to mankind just to make, and then I made it, I felt like a champ. Only to die to the next jump.\n\nNeedless to say it made gave me something to do while I listened to podcasts.
