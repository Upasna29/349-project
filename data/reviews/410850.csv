I got the PS4 version when they put it up for pre-order, and have since sunk dozens of hours into it. Even if it is a Mosou-styled game (think Dynasty Warriors or even Hyrule Warriors) it's still a great game all its own and just oozes the usual Dragon Quest charm. If you were on the fence about purchasing the game because it was coming from Koei Tecmo, fear not! They surprisingly did a fantastic job with their port of this title, and YES, they ported the PS4 version and not the Japan-only PS3 version. The game has a lot to offer, and is a lot of fun to play!\n\nThe Steam version includes all of the special Slime Weapons from the various special editions released for consoles. You have to reach a certain point early on in the game to access them though.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nMonsters and humans have lived alongside each other in perfect harmony for as long as anyone can remember. But one day, every monster in the world (save for one) suddenly turn on their human friends and begin attacking towns and cities around the world. Luceus and Aurora, captains of the Arba Royal Guard, serve as your playable "main" characters. Together with Healix, Luceus' slimy companion is the one monster who remains unchanged, and King Doric, King of Arba, Luceus and Aurora set off on a quest to discover the secret behind the monsters turning, and put a stop to it. The game plays like your typical Dynasty Warriors title. That is to say, you control a character and hack/slash/jump your way through literally hordes of enemies, which are all iconic monsters from the beloved Dragon Quest series. Skeletons, Slimes, Drackies, etc are all here and look amazing.\n\nEarly on, the player gets access to an invention called the Stonecloud, which is essentially a giant flying fortress or airship. The Stonecloud will serve as the player's base of operations in their campaign to combat whatever plot has befallen Arba. Housing all the amenities the player will ever need, the Stonecloud is an indispensable tool in your quest. Shops, a Chapel, and other locations are found on the Stonecloud, and is where your characters will return after each successful battle to recuperate and prepare for the next skirmish.\n\nAlong the way, you will encounter and recruit many heroes from past Dragon Quest titles. Players will recognize many faces, such as Terry, Yangus, Alena, and Isla. All of them are controllable on the battlefield, as your party consist of 4 characters which can freely be swapped between. Each one has a certain play style and unique abilities that can be used to clear waves after wave of monsters in each area. Dragon Quest Heroes also features the Tension system that originated from Dragon Quest VIII. As you take and deal damage, a meter fills up. Once full, you can enter a state of High Tension, which boosts your speed and attack power, and grants access to devastating Coup de Grace attacks!\n\nIn addition to all of the playable characters, Dragon Quest Heroes introduces the Monster Medals mechanic. As you defeat monsters they each have a small chance to drop a medal which bears their image. When picked up, these allow the player to summon these monsters to the field to aid them in battle. Monster Medals come in 2 varieties: Sentry and Saviour. Sentry monsters stay in the general area they are deployed in and defend the area from all attacks. Saviour monsters are 1 time use monsters than provide HP or SP recovery, or other beneficial effects. Using these Monster Medals can often prove to be quite a boon in many different combat scenarios, which can range from defeating all monsters or defending a certain point or character on the field. Each Monster Medal takes up one, two, or even three of the six available medal slots you have, with more powerful monsters taking up the most slots. Picking up medals for monsters you already have summoned will heal them. Monsters are best used to hold strategic points on the battlefield while the player takes care of others, or providing buffs to your party that they otherwise do not have access to.\n\nA lot of other features are present in Dragon Quest Heroes. The Alchemy Pot from Dragon Quest VIII makes a return, utilizing the materials you find during battle to create accessories. You can use the gold you earn each stage to buy weapons, shield, accessories, and orbs. Orbs act as your armor, bestowing upon your characters the benefits of the armors they represent. Mini Medals are earned by completing quests, found on the battlefield, or earned from defeating large numbers of specific enemies; These are then used to buy materials, Alchemy Pot recipes, and special weapons. Accolades act as achievement markers, rewarding you with Mini Medals as you complete certain milestones.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nBeing a port of the PS4 version, the Steam version looks amazing. The AA is a little rough around the edges, but there are workarounds for that for the time being. The game capitalizes on the unique art style that Dragon Quest has had throughout the years, and Akira Toriyama's artwork is front and center throughout the game. There's enough eye candy here to satisfy any newcomer to the series.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nRemember all the classic Dragon Quest sounds, songs, and jingles from yesteryear? Heroes has it all! It's such a nice touch to hearken back to the good old days with the music and sound effects. Many of them you'll recognize from Dragon Quest VIII, honestly. Picking up items, sword slashes, etc. All sound amazing and just instill a great sense of nostalgia. The soundtrack fits the game near perfectly, even if it is a bit light-hearted. Fans will recognize a lot of the tunes present, and even come to love some new ones.\n\nA thing that alot of people like to see is the option to have Japanese voiceovers. Those are available here! I have no issues with the English voiceovers, but some people do, so it's nice to have the option to toggle between them for those players.\n\nPerformance\n==========\n60 FPS? Check!\nMultiple graphics options, including resolution? Check!\nController support? Check!\nIn-game button prompts that match your controller? Check!\nMultiple control schemes? Check!\n\nNo issues here! The game runs very smoothly on my rig (specs on my profile) and I have yet to experience any problems with framerate, stuttering, lag, or anything of that nature. I don't expect to either!\n\nI have public screenshots of all the options on my profile if you are curious.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nThis is an amazing Dragon Quest title, even if it doesn't follow the usual Dragon Quest formula. If you ever want more Dragon Quest titles to come to Steam, buying this game is the best way to vote for more. A solid experience, Dragon Quest Heroes definitely deserves a spot in your Steam Library. Fans of the series will certainly find a lot to offer them, with tons of content and replayability. Nostalgia abounds, and the game is just a complete and utter joy to pick up and play.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=568040290\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nHighly Recommended\n\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","December 3, 2015","true","32.1"," 274 of 334 people (82%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","82","274","334","13","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/allthegoodnamestaken/recommended/410850/","allthegoodnamestaken","Allthegoodnamestaken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/allthegoodnamestaken/","452 products in account","DQH is a reasonably average game. I'm giving it a thumbs down because the combination of length and quality makes a $60 price tag absolutely laughable, and I don't feel I got my money's worth even having paid $30. If it ever goes to $15 or lower, that's a decent time to jump.\n\nProvided you're using a gamepad, the controls and moment-to-moment gameplay are pretty good. Most of the characters (around 10) are fun to play, and the only control issues I ever ran into were problems with held buttons being released mid-animation. I actually think the game would've been bettered served by trying to be Zelda than Warriors - there's a series of Zelda-like one-on-one boss fights about three quarters of the way through the game that I found far more compelling than the rest of the game. The main problem with the other boss fights is that your AI partners are dumb as toast and get themselves killed by telegraphed AoE constantly. Since you only get 4 revives per mission, this is a major and frustrating problem. You do at least have healing items to save them before they get KOed, but these have to be recharged in an incredibly tedious menu every time you use them.\n\nThe other 40 or so story missions are almost entirely represented by the following: boss fight, defend the point, and kill everything. Boss enemies and destructable spawn points do a decent job of keeping things more interesting than they'd otherwise be, but the fact that there's only a dozen or so enemy models that are constantly recolored (and sometimes not even that) and renamed means even those get tiring. Speaking of things getting tiring, all characters have special moves that can only be used after building up "tension points" from attacking enemies. The animations associated with these are pretty cool the first time, but you're going to see your main ones 50-100 times in a campaign, and they never become skippable. "YOU ASKED FOR IT ... LIGHTNING SLASH!"\n\nMonster summoning is basically the opposite of that, thankfully. There's a very short animation that doesn't cut out of the battle, you're constantly getting new options, and using them as defenders gives you new options about how to fight. It's the game's best idea.\n\nNearly all sidequests are pointless filler. A handful give you new combat scenarios, but the rest are all either "kill 100 of this enemy" or "get 5 of this item." Those types are particularly annoying because the game seemingly deliberately picks enemies and items that no longer appear in the story missions. You're forced to go back and grind - sometimes for a significant amount of time - to complete a mission that wasn't interesting in the first place. Worse, rewards are kept secret until you finish. You can at least guess about the ones that'll give you bigger item bags or more monster slots, but all the rest could be anything from a tiny amount of money to very rare crafting items.\n\nThe story is crap. Light and dark, tree named Yggdrasil, ancient baddie sealed away - it's nothing new and it won't keep you playing. The writing itself is fun at first, though. It's as punny as you'd expect from a mainline DQ game, but most of the characters can be described fully in one word. I'd be okay with that if they didn't talk so much, but alas, they do. One "joke" in particular about Luceus' strategies is rehashed in almost every single mission and cutscene. It's painful.\n\nPerformance and graphics are solid. A lot of the options are in the configuration launcher, but the feature set is reasonably complete. I never encountered any series framerate dips even when the screen was full of enemies and effects. Loading times are great (although this was on a SSD) and I never encountered any crashes outside of the widely-reported ones after the second boss. That those crashes are still in the game this long after release and with so many people reporting them at exactly the same spot (it seems to be luck if you get it or not) is definitely a point against the game, however.\n\nNo complaints about the sound. Most of the music and effects appear to be taken from previous DQ games and get the job done. The voice actors mostly have various British accents, as you'd expect, and largely do a good job. Some of the combat sound effects are pretty satisfying.\n\nThe game is loaded with minor annoyances that don't fit into any of the above categories, however. Shopkeeps have lines they say every single time you talk to them or visit certain screens and you're going to get incredibly sick of them. Equipment can only be sold one at a time regardless of how many copies you have. Taking on quests is incredibly slow because the game insists on playing short music clips every time you select or finish one. There's way too much text involved in using any of the ships services, and you're going to accidentally select a lot of things trying to mash through it. Level up skills are pretty boring outside of the three active abilities for most characters. There's a scrolling view of the ship that plays during loading, and the game always finishes that cutscene even if it takes several seconds longer than the actual load.\n\nThere's probably 15-20 hours of content here if you're not going all out on the sidequests. It's not a bad game, all things considered, but it's also not nearly good enough to justify its current $60 pricetag. Unless you're very into DQ and Warriors, in which case you probably already own it, I'd wait for a 75%+ off sale.","May 19","false","15.5"," 331 of 416 people (80%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","80","331","416","11","4"

When I play this game, I smile.\nMany other games are fun. Dark Souls is fun. I don't smile when I play Dark Souls, though.\nI smile when I play Dragon Quest Heroes. Or any Dragon Quest game for that matter.\n\nThis game just oozes charm. The colorful graphics, the campy dialogue. Nothing is too serious in this game, yet I find myself growing fond of the new characters, and loving the iterations of all my favorite ones returning in this title.\n\nThe combat is fluid and hectic, but still requires a bit of strategy and thinking. Got to protect this location? Drop a golem coin while you push the front. Giant mech giving you trouble? Zap that guy with lightning, and wail on him while he's short circuiting. Getting creamed while you keep getting put to sleep? Craft a charm that gives you sleep resistance, then go to town.\n\nIt's a hack and slash game that requires just enough thought to where you can't completely zone out, but still laid back enough to where you won't be constantly frustrated. I love this game. And I think you should give it a shot.","December 6, 2015","true","20.4"," 161 of 191 people (84%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","84","161","191","41","9"

The game might be coded for playstation controllers too but since I don't have one, I can't confirm. Currently the game does not support resoulutions above 1080p.\n\nI expected DQH to be a cross between the Dragon Quest IP and Dynasty Warriors Musuo mode. What I didn't expect is that it is a tower defense game. Very early in the game you're given the ability to summon monsters via monster medals that drop from slain enemies. There are 2 different types of monster medals, Sentry and Savior. Sentries can be summoned to protect whatever thing you're guarding and Savior medals are a 1-time use medal that has different effects like granting buffs, attacking enemies, casting spells, etc. Knowing how and when to use them strategically and intelligently is a must for late game missions\n\nThe music score is classic Dragon Quest fare and I've noticed there's more music used from the other DQ titles whos characters don't appear in this game.\n\nThe story falls into the usual good vs. evil cliche all the games have but that's not something I'm complaining about, It's what I've come to expect of the franchise. I'll leave it at that.\n\nThe graphics are nice, the game plays smooth for me with everyhing on max and turned on even though I'm running an i5 4460 proc with a GTX 580 and 16GB ram. I have not run into any glitches and one crash to desktop for alt+tabbing a lot.\n\nOverall I'm having a lot of fun with it even though it is different from the normal DQ experience.

To explain, I have been a Dragon Warrior/Dragon Quest fan for as long as I can remember. one of the first games I had ever played was Dragon Warrior 1, and when I beat it I slowly began to move onto each indivdual one as they were released. I have played pretty much every western released Dragon Quest game out there spinoffs and all , and as a series the game holds a very special place in my heart. That being said I want to write this review in two sections, one for people who are new to the series, and one for long time fans such as myself.\n\nFor New Players : The game has quite an interesting story, the only thing you will find confusing is the random characters from other games, but they do quite a decent job of making it interesting in and of itself as a game. The combat looks a lot more simplistic than it can be in actuality and it was one of the things that shocked me, in a good way. I didn't expect it to have such a natural feel to it once you get a grasp. I played with the more complicated setup of controlling everything individually and it felt very fun. So far the game seems to have quite a bit of content packed in to optimize your characters however your style of play might be. There is some pretty neat crafting and skill tree systems that actually can effect quite a bit. plenty of quests and side missions scattered in the game and overall very fun. even a pet system of sorts. They also took aa good bit of time to make (most) of the characters unique from eachother, at least once you start getting the later ones. One thing that threw me off at the start was the controls assume you have a controller during instructions, you will have to open menu with esc, then go to misc > settings > keyboard to see how to play with a keyboard. Honestly the one thing I felt that could have seen more attention from the developers is the control scheme itself while intuitive when you get the hang of it, it does noot give the best inctructions on navigating. I started off on a keyboard and pulled out a controller because it didn't feel right. But honestly overall if you are looking for a fairly well polished game with plenty of content to burn through it is very fun as a standalone game if you have never played Dragon Quest. one thing that should be noted is that this is the first Dragon Quest game that isn't a JRPG/turn based strategy game.\n\nFor Long-Time Fans : Wow. I came into this game with so much joy. its been a long time since a dragon quest game came out new in the west and it far exceeded my expectations which were admittedly low with it not being turn based. as a game in itself it is enjoyable but for me it just offered so much more than that. all of the classic sounds and music just hits you with instant nostalgia. every moment offers you a memory of this or that and for me it just was amazing. It is packed with all sorts of references to the main series from the Imp Pets who dont have enough MP for their spells to the legacy characters to the bosses. it had its own characters and story as well that really makes it interesting at least for me. It feels like a more action packed version of all the hours of grinding that I was familiar with, and it has plenty of classic stuff that makes it well worth it. P.S. If nothing else, if you want Square Enix to release more DQ games in the west, BUY THIS GAME. The trailer didn't do it justice and maybe just maybe you will be shocked at how fun it is for a whole new style, like I was.","December 9, 2015","true","11.4"," 46 of 52 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","46","52","3","0"

To finally say that I actually own a game from them that is actually a decent port.\n\n\nDragon quest was a game I thought was exclusive to ps4 but it did so hit pc and I am glad I waited being a huge DQ fan myself. The game has elements of DQ it from the charctersto the music, sound effects and even DQ element such as mixing pot and Tension mode. The art itself from Akira Toriyama (creator of Dragon Ball) is always superb.\nThe game however is a beat em up Musou genre game( I.e Dynasty warrior, One piece warriors etc) so not your typical DQ RPG. Fans of DQ and supporters or those that collect games will want to pick this one up.  The gameplay however can be quite repetitive and more of a novelty.\n\nVideo Review  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5TnSj7Hk3U&feature=gp-n-y&google_comment_id=z13izxma1pbwvteul22ythygkky1zfzcw\n\nPros + Japanese and English choice with text language options (English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Spanish, and Japanese)\n+ Bindable keys, controller configurations etc.\n+ Great art and graphics\n+ Game is locked at 1080p 60fps (Gotta do some manual workaround to get the best you can from your cards to push AA etc, game cannot go above 1080 res)\n+ Dragon Quest Music, Sounds and characters galore along with mixing pot crafting and tension mode.\n+ Hundreds of monsters being on screen at once seeing them heading your way is quite impressive\n+ Tension mode is very flashy and the cutscenes looks great\n+ Plenty of characters in the game with thier own strength and weakness and also weapon style switch around 4 characters at the end of every round at the hub.\n+ Lots of contents such as quests, sidequests, items, trophies, and even recipes to collect.\n+ Rather than focused on just beating countless armies up, The game focus on a tower defense type of gameplay at times and boss fights.\n\nCons - Not being able to go above 1080 res\n- Gameplay can get sort of repetitive after a while\n- Difficulty scaling choice, Game wasn't as hard and I couldn't pick a choice in difficulty. As you progress the enemy get strong but you get much stronger.\n- Menu can be a bit tedious at times, Buying an item one at a time, Putting it on characters, accepting etc. Kills alot of time just spamming the Accept button\n\nConclusion\nThere is words that if you buy and support the game they will bring more Dragon Quest games to pc which I think is a shady move. Instead of doing that how about making GREAT PORTS like this game and bringing it to pc. The fans will buy if the game doesn't come out as half ♥♥♥ ports like other games Cough cough. I'll support dragon quest but please make them awesome if you do bring more to pc.","December 5, 2015","true","7.8"," 59 of 75 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","59","75","3","5"

I do recommend it, but not on the PC. And here's why.\n\nSo, the first problem that you'll notice is that if you have Win10, then the game, on your first launch, will tell you to run the game in Win7 Compatibility Mode. Now that's not so bad in itself, as it works relatively fine in compatibility mode - plays decently, seldom lags during actual gameplay. Nothing too big. But then there's the other issues.\n\nSee, I'm not sure if it's because it's on PC or because it's not compatible with Win10, but the game has a tendency to crash... often. Especially when you alt-tab. Even more often when you try to launch it. A couple of time, the game has outright crashed my computer as a result of playing it - of course, being the game addict I am, that doesn't stop me from playing it anyways.\n\nThe game also tends to lag on loading screens, which isn't too big of a deal - but this causes a lot of issues with the cinematic's audio synchronization, and I don't think in the entire time I played the game I ever had a cutscene's sound in sync. Sure, it's not a big issue - the game's easy to play in spite of that, but this also causes cutscenes to crash at the end. It doesn't crash the game, mind you - just the cutscene. It forces you to, at the end of, or sometimes in the middle of, a cutscene, skip it entirely just to get to the game.\n\nNow, the gameplay itself. It's a hack and slash - entirely unlike any other Dragon Quest game (that I've played) and definitely not unwelcome. I can't help feeling it's trying to shadow Hyrule Warriors, but I haven't played it so I can't say which is better. The storyline is relatively decent, not something you're likely to get into very much, but it's good enough to keep you mildly entertained. The main villain - the human one - is honestly kind of forced. For a bit there I found it difficult not to side with him - if the goddess' goal is to maintain balance, why is it that the world is continuously peaceful with very little chaos? I kinda wanted to help the guy balance the light out with darkness, in truth.\n\nThe actual gameplay is fairly straightforward - kill X enemy/horde of enemies, protect X objective from hordes of enemies... It's repetitive, but the enemies they throw at you are often versatile enough and difficult enough to keep you on your toes. Even once you've reached the postgame and have all your characters maxed out at level 99, it's still no walk in the park - enemies can still kill you, and rather easily, to boot. The bosses are no joke, either - certainly they could have brought the difficulty up on the first boss a little, but it's a tutorial boss, so they can be forgiven. I don't think there were any bosses that felt like they were too easy or too difficult - certain bosses have you protecting an objective, making it a little more difficult, but not overly so.\n\nEnemy behavior is rather straightforward - unfortunately, it's straightforward to the point that certain items in the game are completely useless, namely anything that claims to modify aggro. Enemies - boss enemies and larger enemies specifically - will almost always target whatever character you're playing as. Bosses that have minions will generally target you, leaving the minions to take out the objective you're trying to defend. If it's a person, they often have the tendency to run straight into large hordes of enemies... And I mean STRAIGHT INTO them. It's not that they have no other choice - it's that they're just that stupid. There are very few exceptions to this - the only one that I found was during a boss fight. Thankfully, as enemies grow in strength, most protection targets gain extra health/defense to counter it, so for the most part, all protection targets will be able to survive for a few moments by themselves if you want to go and relieve pressure somewhere else.\n\nGear. Gear's straightforward as well - at least, for a Dragon Quest series game. Each character is limited to one type of weapon, and while there are three characters that use one-handed swords, they each also have swords exclusive to them. Certain weapons have certain bonus effects - if a character doesn't allow a shield on their kit, then they instead have a BLOCK stat on their weapon, so your defense is very easily kept up with by buying - strangely enough - weapons. Of course, there is also armor - or rather, armor orbs. These can be equipped by any member of the party, and always offer some amount of defense. Some of them also offer an extra defensive stat, such as evasion, magic resistance, or magic reflection chance. There's plenty of variety in building your character, especially when you get to accessories...\n\nAh, yes, this is where building your character's individuality truly comes into play. You have accessories for resisting statuses, resisting certain types of damage, amplifying damage in certain situations, aiding in recovery... there's so many options that it honestly feels a little overwhelming at first. Or it would if most of them weren't completely useless.  As I stated before, anything that claims to control monster aggro does absolutely nothing. Most of the status resistances are about the same - they don't really help with the status or the monster in question. The only means of boosting your movement speed in the game is an accessory, but the boost is only 5% - that's not enough to make any form of difference at all. Not even with a full set of 3 equipped. For the most part, equipment that will actually end up getting used will be utility effects - slow immunity and the ability to damage enemies through their block. I will note that msot of the items that give you better health sustain do work decently well - there's an item that gives you an increased chance of getting healed at low health by your party's healslime, which basically makes for an "OHSHI- Oh. I lived." effect. Of course, if an enemy one-shots you... that's not gonna keep you alive.\n\nAll in all, I give the game an 8/10 - if we don't factor in the crashes and audio glitches. With those it's a 5/10 - take it how you will. If you'd rather do without the crashes, you may want to pick up a PS4 and just play it there.","December 23, 2015","false","88.6"," 131 of 207 people (63%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","63","131","207","16","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lockleargaming/recommended/410850/","lockleargaming","Locklear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lockleargaming/","355 products in account","The basic gameplay of Dragon Quest Heroes involves going through missions cutting through swarms of monsters with weapons, spells, and special attacks. After a tutorial of sorts, you have an airship to get around to different areas on the world map unlocked by story progress. Each mission has an objective to complete which honestly doesn’t affect the gameplay in any meaningful way. You cut down swarms of monsters to protect a structure or a person, occasionally escorting a person or killing a boss. You level up your characters, buy new equipment, craft accessories, complete side quests, and continue the story missions.\n\nPROS\nGood amount of characters\nFun to smash through hordes of monsters\nPresentation is wonderful, art and sound\nControls work well (I used controller)\nMonster medals are unique and add a bit of much needed depth to the gameplay\nDragon Quest nostalgia NUKE!!CONS\nSome characters are copies of others\nStory, dialogue, and voice acting are cringe worthy\nEnemies get spongier instead of harder, making combat tedious at times\nMission design is simple, repetitive, vapid\nToo much waiting (status effects in battle stop you for lengths of time, saving takes too long, etc)\nUser experience is flawed (why do I have to talk to an NPC to change my party or save?)\nCamera too close for my liking\nOverall, I can’t recommend Dragon Quest Heroes to many people. The gameplay has a certain zen to it when it decides to let you play. Most of the problems I have with this game come down to the game distracting itself from what makes it fun. Taking away the player’s control takes away from the game experience. I can slice and dice through armies for a few hours. That’s fun. What isn’t fun is waiting for my character to wake up while he’s dying, or watching the quest complete animation for the 5th time in a row, or being forced to listen to trite dialogue during a battle. Even the battles get boring after a while, because the monsters don’t get harder, they just get spongier. At best, I can recommend Dragon Quest Heroes only to extreme Dragon Quest fans who also love Dynasty Warrior-esque games.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoQkaFAt2H0\n","March 28","false","33.9"," 50 of 77 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","50","77","0","0"

After seeing the trailer I noticed that it wasn't the usual Dragon Quest gameplay, but more of a Hack-n-Slash/Tower defense game. Nevertheless I decided to buy the game since I liked the previous one so much.\n\nAt the beginning you can choose your main character (either male or female). The story deals with monsters and creatures turning against humanity, what's usually not the case in this world of Dragon Quest. The further you get into the story, the more allies you gain. Even getting allies from different dimensions/worlds, where characters of older Dragon Quest games come into play. It was funny to see Jessica and Yangus again after all these years, and also fun to get to know the characters from other Dragon Quest games.\n\nWhile you go onto missions, you can always choose a team of 4 characters joining you. Having such a big roster of characters increases the variation in gameplay. Every character has its own spells and attacks and can be skilled in a different way. In addition to that most of them wield different types of weapons. Besides the main story, you can also do side quests and earn additional upgrades with it, use alchemy or collect mini medals.\n\nThe story itself was rather predictable, but it was still entertaining. The gameplay was getting repetitve, after 30 hours into the game. But all in all I really enjoyed the game and I'm looking forward to more Dragon Quest games on steam. 7/10","January 16","true","50.0"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","2"

The game is a musou, meaning you can expect soemthing along the lines of Dynasty Warriors with a Dragon Quest theme. The production values are very high, the game feels very polished, particularly as this genre goes, and despite never really getting into the main series DQ games, I've loved the aesthetic and presentation of this game so far. It's not an overly complex or difficult game, but offers exactly what you should expect from the genre: tons of enemies in large environments, and a bunch of characters with crazy flashy movesets to dispatch those enemies. Beyond that, there's a lite crafting system, and a bunch of equipment to mess around with the tweak characters to your liking and playstyle. Also, I've seen a few reviews that say it's poorly optimized, and that's just not true in the least. In fact, I'd say this is the one Tecmo Koei game that is incredibly well optimized on PC. Ran flawlessly maxed out at 1080p on my GTX 770 I was running when I got the game, and continues to do so on a 980 Ti. I would say the $60 price tag is a bit high, but I paid $40 for it, and didn't regret it in the least. And that's coming from someone who has only ever really been curious about the DQ series and played very little of it. If you are a huge fan of musous and/or Dragon Quest, I think you'll LOVE this game, and that's exactly who this was made for. For those people, this shouldn't disappoint.","May 28","true","14.7"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","20","30","0","0"

It's an amusing way to kill an hour by well... killing hundreds of cartoony monsters. However, that's about all it seems to be good for. After playing for a while, I started to get bored faster and faster. My first play session lasted 4 or 5 hours, the 2nd one only around 2-3 hours, and every play session after that has gotten shorter and shorter. I feel like the game is just too shallow, even for a musou style game. Each level is small (even the biggest level I've done yet is still smaller than the average musou game level) and usually has either no strategic objectives other than the monster summoning portals (named Nightmaws) that you need to close or one or two people/objects you need to protect while you close the Nightmaws. The closest thing to "depth" that the strategy for defending objectives is would be the fact that as you kill monsters, they can drop monster medals which let you summon copies of that monster to defend a small area for you. Generally these monsters do a good job of defending, but can be overwhelemed quickly if you don't keep an eye on them. The number of enemies in each level also feels small compared to other musou style games but to keep the spirit of the Dragon Quest series, you have a party of 4 characters  that you bring to each level. Granted, you don't need to bring 4 people once you have finished the first few levels and unlock the ability to edit your party, but it just feels pointless to bring 4 people when 1 is more than enough. So with that out of the way, time for the pros and cons list.\n\nPros:\nLevel design is good despite the small level size\nGood Music\nGood visual effects\nDecent enemy variety\nDecent Party variety (skill type/playstyle variation)\nFun character personalities/dialogue\nBalanced gameplay (as far as musou style games go)\nCons\n(I will go over the two with asterisks in detail at the end of the review)\nSmall levels\nToo much copy/paste for hero abilities. Some are literally the same ability with a different visual effects.\nSome of the worst english voice acting I have ever heard.\nCrafting system feels worthless/forced*\nInability to skip frequently repeating mini cutscenes/jingles*\nExtremely unoriginal story\nTerrible anti-aliasing\nLack of variety in level objectives\nNow onto the last two things I want to discuss. The crafting system and the mini cutscenes and jingles.\n\nThe crafting system is fine in terms of functionality and UI, but the accessories you can craft are pretty much all completely worthless until much later in the game. The base effects of most of the lower level ones (based on what level you are before the materials for them start to drop) are not going to effect you in any way. For example, one gives you 40% resistance to sleep. That's all fine and dandy... but at the point in the game I got to before giving up, I only encountered 1 enemy type that can put you to sleep and had only actually been put to sleep twice. Ever. The only good thing about the crafting system in early game is that when you combine multiple of the same accessory to upgrade them, a new random stat is added to that accessory. If you are lucky and get one of the few stats that matter it's great, but more often than not you will end up with another worthless stat.\n\nThe last thing to mention is the unskippable mini cutscenes and jingles. An example of the mini cutscenes would be every time you load your game, you have to watch the camera fly down and zoom into the priestess at the cathedral. Not a big deal, but it takes a few seconds each time you load your game, and that adds up. Another example is every time you return to the Stonecloud after you finish a level. You beat a level, go to a loading screen, and then AFTER the loading screen, you have to sit around and wait for another few seconds while the camera cinematically shows you what the central room of the Stonecloud looks like (a room you spend 95% of your time in while not on missions). It adds up. An example of the jingles would be every time you turn in a sidequest. When you finish a sidequest, you have to report it to the questmistress. When you do, she congradulates you by putting a stamp over the quest description window for that quest and then clapping for a few seconds. You can skip her dialogue to a degree, but you can't skip the stamping or the clapping. Say it with me now: It adds up. Things like this also occur for various other events throughout the game such as when a new character joins your party or when you craft an item. To really drive this point home, let's say you complete 35 side quests. have recruited every character (6 mini cutscenes since some are recruited in groups), have loaded your save game 50 times, have completed 100 levels, and crafted 100 items. Now let's assume that each of those events has 3 seconds of unskippable cutscenes/jingles (3 seconds is about the average).  That adds up to 14.5 MINUTES of unskippable, repeated events that you will have seen dozens of times each by the end of the game.\n\nSo there you have it. The game is fun in short bursts and has great looking levels and spell/ability effects, but lacks any kind of depth in level objectives, has a mediocre at best crafting system, wastes your time with unskippable repeating mini cutscenes, has poor english voice acting, small levels, limited enemy numbers and variety, and a story we've all heard a thousand times. The only way I could recommend this game is if you have never played a musou style game before and want to get a taste of a dumbed down version that will require very little effort to learn and beat or if you are a parent who for some reason wants to introduce their kid to a colorful and cartoony musou style game (I won't judge). Aside from that, I cannot recommend this game.","February 10","false","13.6"," 44 of 77 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","44","77","2","0"

Instead, it's more like Hyrule Warriors and other similar titles, where your characters take on whole armies at the time.\nLet's put a few positive and negative points:\n\n+ Gameplay is pretty solid, fun and enterataining.\n+ So many characters from the other Dragon Quest games! It's a huge cameo fest in there.\n+ Nicely remastered music from the classic games!\n+ They didn't forget to include metal slimes, and by all means, they are as elusive and infuriating as they are in the main serie (as well rewarding!)\n+ Tons of side missions!\n+ Cool animation scenes\n+/- Once finished the main storyline, the difficulty increases by a surprising amount with all the extra missions\n- The plot wasn't that much interesting, nor the dialogues. Very, very vanilla.\n- Fairly vanilla also the main protagonists.\n- ♥♥♥♥ING. PROTECT. MISSIONS. There are -tons- of those. And sometimes the AI can get dumb and not walking away from danger (when you're protecting a person).\n+/- The voice of this game's BBEG was so darn annoying.

Since it could've turn out to be yet another clunky PC port like many others we got throughout the years, I wasnt so sure whether to buy it for ps4 or PC. In the end, I got encouraged by the holy refund option Lord Gaben has provided us, so I decided to buy it from Steam. I'm glad and relieved to say; WE GOT A VERY GOOD PERFORMER PC PORT HERE! Maybe some AA issues but nothing that your gfx control panel cant handle, pop that FXAA from nvidia/amd control panel and enjoy the smoothness.\n\nMy second biggest doubt was its being a musou game. I really dont like musou games, although, a musou infused action rpg game within the Dragon Quest universe? That didnt sound bad at all so it managed to pique my interest, and im quite glad it did, because game is great so far.\n\nCombat is fluid, intense (maybe a little bit too easy at the beginning but im sure it'll pick up the pace as I make my way further into the game), monster summoning is a nice touch and adds a small strategic depth to the game, plenty of characters to play with to catch the spirit of musou genre and its done successfuly, story and dialogues are fun and lil bit of cheesy just like they're supposed to be in a spinoff title. And I dont even feel much of a need for talking about the amazing art style the game has; still the beloved Dragon Quest concept, yet its redefined with Pixarish cartoon lines, just perfect. Soundtracks are also pretty sweet to listen and has the classic Dragon Quest tunes to them.\n\n----------Negatives----------\n\nAlthough, there are some down sides. They tried to sprinkle some rpg elements here and there, but it feels quite half *ssed! Like character development for example. At the beginning of the game, you get few level ups by playin the prologue. When you hit the camp, you distribute the skill points, unlock few of the unlockable active skills, and thats that. All the other unlockable skills are just some minor passive effects and stats, which are almost the same with every single playable character, and doesnt really add much of a change to the characters.\n\nAlso the game's UI is so frigging big! I mean, if we werent gonna get higher resolution than 1080p (yes max res is 1080p) developers could've included some UI Scaling option. I sure as hell dont like a minimap which takes 3/10 of my whole screen.\n\nThere's also an issue of, how do I put it, trying way too hard for being old school. Like certain menus, for example the side quest panel; grabbing quests shouldnt take this long. We didnt need to hear 5 seconds of music after accepting every single quest and you cant even skip this! Same with the event dialogues, camera focuses a certain event, characters talk about that event -all is good so far-, but why am I not allowed to skip these dialogues after I finish reading them!? Why in the hell you make me for like 10 seconds for each dialogue to disappear, which takes almost around a half minute in certain cases when more than few characters decided to talk. There are many other annoyances like these, every single interface activity takes way too long and feels clunky with forced, non skippable dialogue windows and lame ♥♥♥ jingles.\n\nAnd finally,there's also the problem of pre-order bonus DLCs. By the time I wrote this review, we didnt had the promised slime edition dlcs, they added them one and a half day after the release, and those slime weapons are just starter weapons. So anyone who pre-ordered the game was already way too past the starting point, therefore couldnt use those dlc weapons. Yeah, false marketing at its best here, almost feels like a scam.\n\nI did hope in this case, that the developers would make these weapons to adjust to your characters' levels when you grab them from mailbox,  since that was the only way to make up for this false marketing, but that didnt happen either.\n\nThere are also no badge crafting and steam trading cards for you collectors as well, and this might be a downside for some.\n\n----------Conclusion----------\n\nAll and all tho, im quite happy with the Dragon Quest Heroes. Game's addictive formula really makes up for it's downsides. If you are an old fan of the series, lots of beloved characters will make you feel nostalgic and you will love this complete new touch both the gameplay wise and concept wise. If you are a newcomer to the series, you'll still enjoy a good ARPG and will be making your entry to one of the most beloved jrpg series. So, a win for everyone. Great buy, great port,great fun.\n\n----------SCORE: 8,5/10----------","December 3, 2015","true","6.8"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","12","19","2","0"

It's still a superbly enjoyable game and some of the bosses can be fun to fight! Definitely worth a chance and a great introduction to the series!

I hope the quests will gain variety as i advance to end game.\n(you can revisit areas and just kill everything in sight to get exp and items)\n**CONTROLS**\nthe controls are bad if you're playing with a keyboard and a mouse.\ni know this was originally a console ONLY game and these kinds of games are better played with a controller but this is PC! A LOT of players play PC only games so they do not have a USB controller in hand\nand since you're putting this on PC... you guys should have changed the UI for better mouse and keyboard compatibility\ni DO play with a keyboard and a mouse and i had a hard time changing the controls cuz everything is translated to gamepads.\nbtw i played on playstation since i was a kid so to me the buttons are square circle X and triangle\nnot Y X A or some strange SHEET like that lol and that made me even MORE lost when i was setting up the game\nthat's all i guess everything else is good as far as i could see during my short 5 hours of my first day after picking this game up.\nin conclusion this is a great game i definetly recommend it\nbut it could have been better","December 7, 2015","true","23.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The text is too slow and interrupts the game a bit too much early on, and there are a few too many escort/defend missions where I'd prefer just killing everything.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/erdrickthehero/recommended/410850/","erdrickthehero","Erdrick The Hero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/erdrickthehero/","71 products in account","I highly recommend this game to all Dragon Quest fans and lovers of action games. However, unless you have a rather powerful computer to play on, I must recommend you go for the PlayStation 4 version over this one.\n\nThis is my first "hack-and-slash" kind of game, and I love it. I'm not sure if I would particularly enjoy just any game of the genre, but the alure of Dragon Quest is enough to get me to try anything once, and this was impressive enough that I'm already sold on the upcoming DQ Heroes II. However, since I do not have much other experience with the genre, I'm not well equipped to compare or contrast it with other games.\n\nI can, however compare this version to the PS4 version, which I owned until recently (and intend on purchasing again when I can get a copy of the Collector's Edition). The requirement for an i7 processor seems to be irrelevant - the one listed appears to be on the lower end of the i7 scale. I'm about 3 hours into the game and haven't had any problems with my i3-2120 @ 3.3GHz. (I'm not an expert, your results may vary.) However, I was a little dissappointed with the graphical requirements. I had to fiddle with the settings quite a bit to get the game to run at 60fps on my machine, and even now it occasionally dips around 30-ish at 720p. (I"m currently using an Nvidia GeForce 640GT.) I had to drop all the graphical settings between the low and medium settings to achieve even this resolution and framerate. It's not quite as pretty as the PS4 version this way. But I'll give it this: It looks much more beautiful and fluid than the Japanese-only PS3 release, which is locked to 1280x720 @30 fps, with much less impressive textures and shaders.\n\nOne last thing to note: While I didn't particularly expect it, I'm still disappointed by the lack of native DualShock 4 support. Even though Sony has released official drivers for it, I have yet to find a single game that supports the controller natively (without treating it as a generic DInput device). Though I was able to get around this inconvenience using an XInput wrapper (the one I use is called DS4Tool), it's still annoying, as I figured a previously PlayStation-exclusive title such as this would be a good candidate for DS4 support. Also, the rather basic-looking XBox button prompts do the job well enough but look like they were just thrown in without consideration for how they look with the rest of the HUD. They'r rather flat, with a boring font and light colors, and look rushed. (This is also the case for the PC port of the Japanese-only Dragon Quest X... Looks like a pattern to me.)\n\nI'd give the game a 10/10 overall, 8/10 for the PC port specifically.","January 30","true","16.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Supposedly when you use tension moves the frame rate drops to 30. My eyes were too bugged out at the visuals to care. There are lots of graphics options in the menus. It's not a perfect port, but much better than most. I don't remember ever playing a Dragon Quest game; I remember seeing them at the importer for $200 growing up and purchasing something else. So I'll explain what the prologue plays like from a newcomer to the series.\n\nThe cutscenes are awesome. 60fps just like the rest of the game. I put on the English voices and they are really well done. Nothing cringeworthy so far; including the cute monster that helps you. The first negative is that you can't skip the cutscenes. So be prepared to watch a nice little enjoyable film with near perfect AA.\n\nAfter the explanation of why the world has been taken over, you finally get to use your character. I chose the male warrior, but I think I will switch to the female to continue my playthrough as he seems to brag about planning every move too much for my tastes. Here is the second negative; there is no AA in the game as I can tell except for the cutscenes. So I went into AMD Crimson and tried to force it to no avail.\n\nAfter going through the entire, "ARGGH I'm going to die without AA" writhing motions, I decided to play the game to see how it is. There are so many enemies to fight that I immediately forgot about a lack of AA. In short, cry on the forums about the AA, then have fun playing the game as it is fun as hell!\n\nAlso the game can't display above 1080p resolutions. I couldn't figure out how to get VSR to work and people on the Steam forums are crying about Nvidia's DSR not working. Personally I find the game so much fun that I could care less. And I'm the loudest SOB when it comes to bad ports. I don't think that this is a bad port at all. I want to play every Dragon Quest game now!\n\nAs far as the game play goes, it is freaking awesome to hit enemies with combo spin attacks. Jump into the air and plunge your sword into the hapless souls beneath you. Perform a 4 chain combo with a spinning fire blade attack at the end. Summon a tornado! Buy some gear at a vendor and collect ingredients from monsters. The game even tracks which monster dropped each ingredient and how many you have killed. The tooltips for stuff like Horse Manure are hilarious to me. It's a ton of fun I must admit. The ultimate moves are just beast mode. I'm loving the game.\n\nOh and you do need to block some attacks. I got flatlined in about 5 seconds by the tutorial dragon. Went back and blocked maybe 10% off the attacks, in conjunction of some spirited bunny hopping / running like a ♥♥♥♥♥ when my health hit critical, and I was able to best him on the second try. There are other lesser "big" mobs that have attacks that you need to watch out for.\n\nI think it's worth the $60 price tag as I've never played something like it before.\n\nOverall I highly recommend this game as it is 1000x more fun to play than watch on Twitch. I played the game with my Steam controller and I chose the first profile that I saw was popular. Game played perfectly fine with it. I have a XBOX 360 controller, but it hurts my hands so I'm weaning myself off of it. The game plays fine with a mouse and keyboard, but it displays XBOX controls. Maybe there is an option to change it, but I didn't look long before I bust out the Steam Controller. Also it recognizes mouse / keyboard and controller at the same time for seamless switching.","December 5, 2015","true","1.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Like many of the fans of these kinds of hack and slash games like (Dynasty Warriors) and others that have become from KT with inferior ports to the PC compared to their console counterparts, I shared a concern.\n\nHowever allow me to allievate most of your concerns if I can:\n\nLike most of these kinds of games, you'll most likely want to try a controller, I can safely say that it runs super smooth and all the prompts for this port work correctly!\nStable 60FPS, not a single drop.\nPS4 Texture Ports (So it doesn't like like a terrible PS3 port), unfortunately max resolution is 1920 x 1080 but for most including my self this isn't really a problem, sure in 2015 its kind of gross for any Developor to not properly add in all the resolutions but I honestly can't care enough at this time, I didn't have high enough hopes as it is from KT.\nThis is way more in depth then Hyrule Warriors and Dynasty Warriors for those wondering, it has a decent selection of items(but so did those two other games) several spells, RPG elements, monster summoning (you can capture them in this game and basically use them like towers). All in all its an Action game with a decent light RPG system.\nI was expecting trash but I can honestly say I'm really happy with Dragon Quest Heroes, this is the first Koei Techmo game that wasn't trash and while this is my very first Dragon Quest, I'm happy to say I like the style of the art and the such.\n\nI know some others are complaining that its not a full fledged tactical RPG for which the Dragon Quest name is famous for but for those of you who like this genre of game like DW and HW, then you are in for a special treat.\n\n","December 3, 2015","true","4.0"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","2"

There is quite a big number of weapons for every character, and they look different bur they play the same almost all the time. There is a levelling system which works quite well, every level up you get on each character gives you point to upgrade that character, there are three special abilities for every character, they are not in categories, every one of them is pretty cool and unique. The graphics are perfect for this type of cell shading, obviouslt the character desing is great considering that Akira Toriyama made it, if you've seen or read Dragonball you will notice it, a lot and that to me is a huge pro. There are lots of different monsters and each one is pretty unique. During combat you will be able to summon monsters and that adds a lot of deepness in the gameplay. As an hack'n slash this is not the best one out there, i really prefer Bayonetta over this, but it is also true that is a different gameplay. The sounds are great, you can choose beetween japanese and english languages for the audio, musics are great and sound effects too. I am really in love with this game, i've actually played just a bit of Dragon Quest on the ps2, and this is not a turn based rpg so it is not really comparable.\nI've read about performance issues, but running this on a 980 never have me a proble, 1080p 60fps maxed out, the framerate gets locked to 30 when you're doing a particular type of attack that i won't spoil.\nBuy this game if:\nYou love hack'n slash games, you like Dragonball, you are not looking for the most deep story and you just want to kick asses.\nDon't buy it if:\nYou hate hack'n slash, you hate anime, you want a deep rpg like the other games of this serie.","May 28","true","3.4"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

I would definately recommend this if you like the Dynasty Warriors franchise and/or the Dragon Quest franchise. Plus with the Monster summoning system where you can summon enemies to aid you if they drop the "coin" really adds tonnes of stratergy in the game, it makes you think on how to do things without it being overly difficult.

I have been playing Dragon warrior/Quest since 1990. While I havent played all of the games, I can state that I have played enough of them to know that KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.  did a great job. They put plenty of familiar DQ/DW monsters in the game. IThat is a major plus.  Also this isnt a  regular Dynasty Warrior clone. He RPG elements make this a Dragon Quest game. The familiar characters form 4 and 8 made this a great DQ/DW game. This game will take on average 30-45 hours to complete. You will be switching your teammenbers around a lot. You willalso soon discover that those side quest are more mandatory than optional.  Nothing Wrong with that. I usually beat RPG's main story quest and not the side quest. In this game I actually wanted to do the side quest.   I think if the gam had mor than just tower defense, t would have been a classic like DQ3,4, 8 and 9.   But the game does let you go back to stages after you beat them if you want to grind exp or items. YOU WILL BE DOING THIS A LOT. All in all, the story was average. The graphics were great as well . Difficulty isnt too bad, just be ready to use your mind  and grind a litle. Not too much I would say give the game a try if you like DQ. Its got plenty of nods to the great past. Hopefully this is the start of a great future .","February 14","true","39.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","6","11","2","0"

Sure you level up your characters and spend ability points to give them new abilities and improve on them, however most missions give you an objective to guard and you are tasked with protecting it, usually from multiple sides, with the assistance of magic tokens that allow some monsters to fight beside you and your companions.\n\nHaven't put that many hours into it yet but I'm already finding it repetitive. Sure each level is different and so far more difficult, however I'm just not as entertained by this game as I was by other Dragon Quest games. I will definitely put more time into it since I spent the money and want to make sure I'm not missing anything but this definitely feels way more casual than I was hoping it would be.\n\nIt definitely has the same feel as other Dragon Quest games as far as the characters, both allies and enemies go which is a definite plus.\n\nThis game definitely plays a lot better on a controller than it does with a keyboard and mouse so be aware of that going in. All the controls even show they are mapped out to a controller in the tutorial part which made things interesting until I caved and connected a controller.\n\nAlso, I'm sure this is listed everywhere else and I just missed it prior to purchase, but if you are running windows 10, expect some issues with getting it running. I had a crash on start up until I figured out I have to run the game in windowed mode with windows 7 compatibility turned on. A look on the forums revealed I am not the only one that is dealing with this.\n\nBottom line: If you're looking for an in depth RPG, you may want to keep looking. If you are looking for something fun and casual, especially if you're a fan of Dragon Quest, this isn't a bad buy.","March 3","true","3.7"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","13","25","3","0"

Also there's a decent amount of light RPG elements - leveling, skill trees, crafting etc. Nothing really complex but it doesn't have to be for this type of game.\n\nI'd recommend it to hardcore DQ-fans, hack'n'slay lovers and people who don't mind shutting their brain down and have some fun in a great looking game.\n","December 4, 2015","true","20.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I was utterly dissapointed, there are a few good points but the bad outwaeighs the good.\n\nSummary of good Points.\n1. No more turn based combat. -It is quite a contreversial change because of the JRPG genre usually focusing heavily on turn based but changing it to action was a good move it brought the game to life.\n2. Crossover of all the charecters from the entire series. -The charecters from the ninetendo being introduced was exciting exhellerating even seeing some of my favourite charecter bought to 3D is still enjoyable.\n3. Well done graphics. -Can't say I'm not impressed it is quite a big improvement.\n\nNow on to the bad points.\n1. The combat is repetitive. -Although the change from turn based fighting to action figthing was a good idea, it is not challenging at all. You know a few combo's and you can win the game easily without dying once. There was maybe 3 boss batlles where I had probelms but that turned around quickly  once I started to exploit their weakness. Be prepared for a lot of repetitive button mashing.\n2. The crossover charecters feel dead. They have almost no emotional input towards the story except towards one of the  two main charecters and some banter but nothing interesting. (and to those who say that this game was made for family my argument is go play rogue galaxy it has is teen rated but my 8 year old cousin is playing that now and he is enjoying the experience.)\n3. The poorly written story. -This game is too obvious on too many occasions. This story is the WORST in all of the dragon quest series games. You want a more linear, single plotted story line then you'll enjoy this but for people who actually enjoy the stories and takes on RPG's and sometimes different endings, you should stay away from this game you will find this boring very quickly. The charecters are overly positive and caused me to wonder what was going through their minds and then they blurt it out. The progression is stereotypical, as in the bad guy is evil older than 200 years and killed his people for no apperent reason than being evil. The supposed big reveal of the characters is not really a surprise you can see that coming from a lightyear away.\n4. This game is not difficult. -As i said in point 1 this game is too easy there is no difficulty spike asside from a few varying challenges(3-4 of them) to my experience that is pathetic.\n5. Linear level design. - Seriously this is a very qeustionable thing there is almost no exploration factor except maybe that you can revisit levels but that is not worth it because of the combat. Some of the previous games were open world you could explore and if you ventured to far your ♥♥♥ would get whooped, what happened to that aspect?\n6. The crafting system. -First off i thought that this would be well done but apparently what you equip makes no difference to your appearence (except the weapons and shields). The alchemy pot has no waiting time that might be a good idea for impatient players but it removes the factor of exploration (refer to point 5). Secondly the drop rate of some of the rare items outnumber the drop rate of the basic items, so youll have all the rare stuf to craft the awesome items but then you need to fo and farm for the basics cause even the rare items need  the basic items (makes no sense and removes any further sense of progression)\n\n5/10 Very dissapointing to me is not worth even the name of the excelennt franchise.","January 3","false","24.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

It'll suffice to say that it's DQ fan-service in a Dynasty Warriors game.  You should know what you're getting yourself into just by that sentance alone.\n\nThe port is quite good.  Mouse driven menus, a good amount of graphics options, and rebindable keys.  This is what a port should be at the least, and if SE hears us, it should follow the rest of their RPGs with this kind of treatment. (none of that poor launcher stuff for Final Fantasy XIII let us do it in game like here)  Give us a solid port a few months after console and I'll be happy for the foreseeable future.  Hopefully this means we'll see DQ XI eventually on Steam, not to mention Star Ocean 5 and Final Fantasy XV!  PC is a market you need to care about SE, keep it up!\n\nJust to note: I'm below the minumum specs in CPU, I have a first gen i5 at 2.8 GHz and I can keep 60 fps at medium + a few things on high.

It's more of a arena styled game were you fight off waves of monsters rather than your typical "Go to point A and Defend it" scenario we've seen a thousand times in Koei Tecmo games.\n\nBUT, I have to say if you're running Windows 10/8.1 you might need to play the game in Windows mode or Windows 7 Compatiblity mode because the game has some optimization issues. The game does also suffer from the occational FPS drop but it maintains a stable 60 fps on my machine most of the time.\n\nBugs in the game are pretty big, but nothing game breaking. I've came across a bug that wouldn't let me leave the game, so I had to bring up the command menu in Windows and suddenly the game gave me back full control.\n\nSo far, it's a decent port but I would only recommend this for die-hard Dragon Quest fans or Dynasty Warrior fans.","December 3, 2015","true","0.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

You pick coins on the gtound and summon them for that battle only. They don't even follow you they just stay at the same place you put them at. Why am I so disappointed. Because I played Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King on PS2. Which just spits on this game.That game was a good dragon quest game. I spen 3 months playing that game and oh boy it deserves every cent I paid for it. I hoped this game will be ''similar'' to it. But I just realized that I bought Samuray Warriors or Dynasty Warriors.

I will admit the core campaign isn't particularly difficult to start but there are moments where the difficult spikes. If you're a long time fan of the series it's a real treat to see them come to life in this game along with getting snippets of backstory from their respective titles. That's not to say they're not without their camp, but hey it comes with the series. As for the negative reviews, the majority are knee jerk reactions to issues with users being unable to load into the game or just complaining and don't reflect the current state of the game. It's a shame Steam doesn't allow for downvoted reviews to be negligible because frankly after some time those reviews aren't relevant anymore. So don't let that detract you.\n\nPros:\nLikeable characters\nA variety of character playstyles\nSeeing old DQ characters see new life!\nSeeing the DQ series monsters in action!\nGetting to play a hack and slash DQ game\nA substantial amount of game content\nPost-game content is challenging but rewarding\nJapanese VO option\nCons:\nParty AI is pretty dumb\nCertain characters are just key to have in the party to get past difficult battles more easily\nBattles can get repetitive\nDifficulty spikes unexpectedly on occasion\nThe story doesn't bring anything new to the table","March 5","true","57.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It even has English and Japanese voice options depending on your preference (usually Japanese is the way to go in games like this, but I can't be bothered to read subtitles while in the heat of the battle).\n\nOverall I feel this game was worth it.

It's just a matter of how it reacts with your specific situation. It's also not a poor port, but you fail to realize that instead of designing a game for a restricted enviroment like console, where the variable are set, it's running on a highly unpredictable entirely customizable coctail of random background processes and porno viruses. Stop blaming the developers for not being able to predict how the game reacts in every situation with every program ever, I mean honestly\nGet the game, if you can run it, fine. If you can't start it, refund it and get it again later after patching.\n\nThis game is not just a simple port, just because this game came out on console as well does NOT make it a port. The game was worked on and released for console and pc, and even had work done on the game specifically to 100% support the new steam controller specifically to enhance the PC and steam experience. I have full functionately with my controller, and the buttons match perfectly, even allerting me of the bottom button controls, under the controller. It's a great game that steals many hours, and has a steady progression pool.

They have the bare minimum. From what I've seen, unless certain events happen, like an enemy falling over, which they still suck at, they'll walk over to a mob, block, then if by miracle, might attack. They have a nasty tendency to get themselves killed or injured, which, depending on what you build, could make your accessories worthless. They lack the ability to use certain skills that make the character good. If you think you can work around this, think again. Say you want to infinite vortex/scythe an area to help clear that area, well, you better not switch to someone else, cause that AI is gonna tell you to ♥♥♥♥ off, turn that ♥♥♥♥ off, then melee people for 1 damage. Brillant. Just awful all around. Really is a huge glaring issue for a game that's about strategy and team builds for efficency when the AI suicides and can't even tie their shoe laces.\n\nThis really doesn't matter too much, but if the game had coop of some kind, it could make this seem less painful. Reason it doesn't matter is the AI would still be trash even if that was there anyway.\n\nThere is no clarity really in this game, by which I mean, if you decided to make accessories, well, good luck finding out which ones are one per person only. The game is really vague about what items do as well, usually saying things like "This will increase your damage." without a percent or number anywhere.\n\nThe game can get stale real fast. You'll end up doing the same moves over and over again, with no real competition. You get all these spells, but they just aren't worth using since you have to wait on long charge times to get meh damage. Some of these spells barely go anywhere anyway and tend to just go wherever. It feels even worse when you consider the fact the main characters are basically carbon copies of each other. You might get a different sword here and there, maybe even some stat differences, but they have the same exact skills. With such a limited roster of characters, did this really need to be a thing? You also walk to everywhere area, making things unnecessarily slow. The tension running speed feels like it should have be a default, or maybe a run button option or something.\n\nI think the menu's are poorly done. If you want to craft something, you have to wait for his stupid lines, wait for the animation, blah blah blah. I don't care! The game waste so much time on something you'll be doing alot if you want better accessories, there isn't any good reason why you can't just make the damn thing and just be on your way. Same goes for most other vendors as well, stupid nun. At least with that one they only do the animation once.\n\nI found the story to be pretty meh. Really, there isn't any real reason the good guys should have won when you get to a certain part, but hey, gotta get to that vomit inducing last act.\n\nSome hitboxes were a little off, but eh, once you know it's k.\n\nMonster token AI is pretty laughable as well. While in the story it probably won't be an issue, they can shove enemies around, so if you have an objective, they can literally kill you by objective. They don't really defend, more like aimlessly wander. Found them to be more useful to shove near portals for a distraction then as a guardian of something.\n\nBuffs and debuffs are just stupid. Even with the extended, they last around 10 seconds. This seems to also include animation times like the coup. Even more insulting is there is an accessary for 10% longer buffs. Wow, a whole second, better get 3! This could actually been a ok workaround if they gave you the chance to use your allies skills on other characters, like command them to do certain things for strategic purposes, but no.\n\nField of View originally is horrible. Who needs to see right, hahaha! Luckily the PC has a mod, but that person did the mod, not the developers of the game, so they can eat it.\n\nBlocking could work fine, but they decided to also make it the reset camera, so when you try to block, the game will do the camera first, then after lining back up, will let you block. Good, good, good godd gosfdosmgagnafoaunfoanfa.\n\nAt times dodging felt kinda delayed, but its hard to really feel if it was a delay or if I was still in a stun animation from my attacks, so let it slide. Gotta love the 2 handed sword guy, no problem there :P Super derp AI though.\n\nReally, if you only go for the story and skip the harder options, you'll be fine for the most part, but once anything challenging comes up, the hinderances of this game are gonna make it just plummet. For sucha sloppy job, I wouldn't recommend it. Supposedly there is gonna be a sequal with coop, wait for that, it'd make it way more worth it.\n\n","December 16, 2015","false","77.4"," 21 of 44 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","21","44","0","11"

The trailers made it look like Dragon Quest meets Dynasty Warriors, and while this is technically the case, most missions put more emphasis on a system that works more like  tower defense than anything else. The story is obscenely bland and clichéd, and offers only one plot twist that you can see coming from the very beginning. Combat is no better, offering little more than mindless button mashing - something that will be a grave disappointment for previous fans of the Dragon Quest series, while the tower defense aspects of the combat system feel tedious rather than fun.\nAs far as a value/money ratio, you're better off elsewhere. The advertised "slime weapons" that were offered as extra content/dlc are weaker than most characters' starting weapons, and worse, cannot even be sold to the vendors, rendering them worse than useless since the inventory starts out very limited and you can't get rid of them. The main story offers barely over 20 hours of gameplay, and most sidequests feel like a boring grind rehashing the same dull combat system and bringing nothing new to the table.\nOverall, I'd say that the game is worth around $10-15, a far cry from the $60 they're now charging, which essentially amounts to a whopping $3/gameplay hour for a boring, repetitive disappointment.","December 12, 2015","false","25.7"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

Copy-paste story, bad voice acting, unresponsive controls, glitches and bugs, poor graphics fidelity even on max, annoying cut scenes, 2D characters who i felt no attachment towards, boring character customisation, extremely repeditive gameplay, and incredibly disruptive game mechanics. Square Enix stripped all adventure elements from the game. It is now an on-rails repeditive grind. Gameplay "innovations" dumbed down what made the original iterations of the game a classic. Combos are impossible to pull off with mouse and keyboard. The roles of tanks/fighters/mages/healers do not come into play. The AI is downright terrible. They rarely do anything useful, and seem to be very prone to getting caught in massive crowds of enemies and dying. All the tactics and finese of the previous tiles has devolved into Button Mash Simulator 2k15.\n\nHuge props to the advertising team. 10/10 would get ♥♥♥♥ed over again.","December 12, 2015","false","5.3"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

They took dynasty warriors and combined it with Dragon Quest. That was a pretty good idea. The game is very fun. It is not turn based like the other Dragon Quest games and it is hack and slash. The steam controller is already setup to work well with this game. The only problem that I thought was tedious was the camera angle for some of the fights. I could not turn the camera around sometimes when I wanted to face forward with the steam controller. This is after you get more companions to help you fight. I am sure the developers can fix this issue. Nevertheless, I think this game may hit big for game of the year.

Very pleased with the amount of options for graphical settings and the like as well. Solid port.\n\nExcept, it runs at 5 fps constant on my rig. I have a laptop with a GTX 960M and an i7 4720HQ with 8GB of Ram. I should be able to run this at least halfway decent at even the lowest settings. Very upset with the optimization and will definitely change my review if this gets dealt with.\n\nUPDATE: Alright apparently the only way to get this game to run on Laptop GPUs is to run it in windowed mode, otherwise it won't even start if you try to force it to use the dedicated GPU. Not ideal but it finally gave me some time to actually play the game.\n\nPros:\n-Gameplay is smooth and enjoyable if a little bit on the easy side so far.(May change in the future)\n-Leveling system isn't what you would expect from a DQ system but I like it. Allows for some customization.\n-The game is incredibly visually appealing. The particle effecfts and animations for abilities are great.\n\nCons:\n-In cutscenes the audio is desynched from the video. Not sure if that is because I am using English voices or because it doesn't work all that well with laptop GPUs. Either way it is incredibly annoying and immersion breaking.\n\nI have changed my review to RECOMMEND because so far after I have got it working it has been quite fun. I will definitely continue to play and hopefully finish it.","December 3, 2015","true","3.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","12"

If a company can't even be bothered to make the button prompts for a PC appear as something other than X-Box controller prompts, then they really shouldn't be allowed to call it a 'port'.  I know it's a little nitpicking, but the only place to see what button controls what is through the main menu that you have to exit the game to find.  And then it only tells you things like 'Jump - Space'.  Which is fine, right?  Because you know that you need to press Space to jump.  But run up to a treasure chest and it says 'Press A'.  Well... which button is 'A'!?  Turns out its your jump button.  There is a SECOND key binding menu, this one only accessible WHILE PLAYING the game (that is, not at the title screen) that tells you 'A - Spacebar' and such.  But doesn't tell you that Space Bar is your jump button.  So if you didn't bother to read the menu keybindings before playing the game, then you get the privelege of hitting every button on your keyboard and mouse until you figure out what they all do.  And good luck if they tell you to hit 'X' or 'RT' or some nonsense during actual gameplay.\n\nSeriously, KOEI, Square, how hard is it to do a proper port?  All that would need changing are some graphical icons inside the game.\n\nNow we get to the gameplay.  If you had watched the trailer, you might have been seriously mislead into believing you were buying a free-roaming adventure game, possibly FF XIII-like in combat, I hear it compared to 'Dynasty Warriors' a lot, or any number of open-world hack n' slash games.  Not true!\n\nYou will have been duped into buying a Tower Defense game.\n\nIf that's your thing, then this isn't a con by any means.  You can revisit maps later and just fight wave after wave after wave of endlessly-spawning monsters, but 'run up to monsters and smash or hold X' isn't what I would call the height of entertainment.  But pretty much all of the 'story missions' break down to 'fight boss', 'clear enemies', or 'defend location'.  They even use a monster-spawn mechanic so you can set up gaurdians along the routes the monsters will take to the objective you have to defend.  Don't be fooled.  This IS a Tower Defense game, not Dynasty Warriors.\n\nThe DLC they promise you makes it sound like they're going to give you some weapons and maps.  They are not.  That Digital Slime Edition they put out as bait just means these items are added to all the other items in the game you have to find and obtain.  Okay, it's not bad that they added some new items, but I would barely call some reskinned weapons inserted into the game a free DLC.\n\nOverall, this game seems horribly simplified, misrepresented, rushed to PC, and generally not meant for anyone over the age of 10.\n\nOh... and Healix.  STFU Healix.  Forever.\n\nkthnx","December 4, 2015","false","8.7"," 77 of 167 people (46%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","46","77","167","6","7"

First off don't get me wrong this isn't a "OMG this game sux if you get it I hate you" type of review, hell the combat in game feels pretty good and is the only reason I even want to finish the game.\n\nOne problem I think the game has is that it's so suited as a childs game that the difficulty is pretty low and many things in the game throw out logic that only someone of young age would ignore.\n\nThe mission system has its own problems as well, you go into a place with some objective (usually defend point A from wave of monsters or kill everything usually the defend thing though because the game is so easy that without something to defend you could broadway through every mission in no time) complete the objective and someone from the party will be like "aw that was tough better rest at camp till we wanna go to the next thing" even if the next area is literally across the bridge where you ended off at before, not to mention they let you have areas in the cities that you have completed as grinding zones for no reason other than the fact that people you dont have in the party get almost no experience if any when you do stuff and thus fall way behind in levels quickly.\n\nMy last issue is the story, putting it bluntly it is really crap. to sum up what I've seen thus far with as little spoilers as possible (not that they matter in this game -_-) People live in harmony with monsters, weird black wave goes across the land (the player can see what caused it but the characters don't know) all monsters go aggressive, while saying you want to save your friend monsters you mercilessly slaughter all that come across you without a second thought. and of course once the token flying ship is in place you go around saving the towns from the aggro monsters completely ignoring the giant mountain in the middle of the land masses that is spewing black darkness.\n\nAlso if you are reading this as someone who already owns the game I hope you can agree with me that if I was the MC of the game I would pretend healix turned evil and kill him without holding back, I freaking hate everything about him/her (voice, over-used goo and slime puns, etc) he/she really lacks as a mascot character\n\nSo yeah I could see where someone would get off liking this game but I honestly wouldn't recommenc this to anyone, I've played games that cost less than 10$ with better stories than this one...\n","December 14, 2015","false","18.8"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

Admittedly I don't know very much about the Dragon Quest Franchine, I was hoping this would get me into it, maybe make me want to find a DragonQuest game i could get my hands on, I don't know if this will deter me, but it certainly wouldn't give me MORE of a reason to get into it.\n\nIt sounded like a cool idea, but really it doesn't feel like any sort of challenge. The enemies are just monotonous to kill, within less than two hours it felt like I was just doing chores.\nWhat sold me with the Dynasty Warriors franchise was the fact that there was some story, and it was on a grander scale, and it felt like you were rolling in with armies, fighting against other armies in a truly over the top spectacle. THIS title lacks all of that however, it feels like you, and your 4 man crew walk in, like the Nazi's in WWII and just completly eradicate helpless little creatures for gold.\n\ncould have been great if it was more like Dynasty Warriors, but it's overall kid-like packaging, ease and lack of substance made it stop short of greatness and just linger in mediocraty.\n5/10","December 4, 2015","false","2.0"," 12 of 61 people (20%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","20","12","61","7","7"

My friend and i watched for about 10min as i sat in a horde of about 50 monsters and watched as they walked around in circles doing nothing but being cancer. the bosses are even terrible, this game feels like it was designed for babies. the 1st gigantes boss i fought will stop what hes doing and will turn around so hes facing you and will stand still so you can shoot him in his weakpoint "his eye". also for a new gen game, its not open world and has very limited maps. its all small instances of tiny maps with a loading screen before every 5min long fight.\n\nStory- its pretty generic, Bad guy shows up and drops his mix tape, and all the monsters start to party hard. and the king is like "Yo dawgs turn down this noise, no fun allowed" then you go on a quest to put out the fire.\n\n-another thing is all of the cutscenes are voice acted but the ingame dialog is text. pretty lazy but tbh i find this a good thing because the voice acting in this game is terrible. the 2 main characters are ok, but everyone else so far is terrible. the slime prince sounds like something out of peppa-pig "yes the kids show", the King sounds like an angry midevil gym teacher, and theres a pair of space brazilians who have like 8 accents mixed into one "the spear guy, and girl with the blue hat".\n\nIm a fan of DQ games but this is not a DQ game. this is an abomonation. save your money and watch actual gameplay as well as some of the cutscenes before you buy it.

The game doesn't have that many mechanics but at the start doles them out indivdually, one per mission. It's EXCRUCIATING and almost made me not play any further.\n\nThankfully! The actual game once you get your airship and can actually do things is pretty good. The focus on tower defense makes it a very different sort of warriors game from your usual "just kill everything on the field that's not your color" type of affair. Makes you think more than usual, and all the systems going at once creates an entertaining sort of chaos you have to balance to complete the missions.\n\nGame also look great, with a very charming adaption of the DQ artstyle and tone. Animations are almost offputtingly hight quality for how simple and cartoony the character models are. I could watch the pub lady flip her wrist around for HOURS\n\nThat being said this game takes a sort of weird direction for a warrior game where the actual combat depth is very shallow, and as far as I can tell no one gets combos longer than 4 hits, but instead get multiple magic attacks. Those looking for the depth of combos in say, Hyrule Warriors, will be disapointed.\n\nI also wish the tactical elements were actually deeper. If this game had a system like the Empires warrior spin off where you could acutally pause and tell captains where to go it would be way more interesting. Instead you have to set up monsters as 'turrets' of sorts to lock down routes. This makes it seem a little ridiculous that your entire party of 4 powerful warriors feels the need to stay locked together at the hip at all times. Why can't I leave one of the 4 somewhere so they can protect one of the routes?\n\nAnd a final note. This game's cutscenes.... are TERRIBLE. Shocklingly bad. The male hero character is completely unlikable (and this appears to be the point for some reason) All the cutscenes are also far far too long, the direction is awful. The content of the scenes and the writing are basically fine but the presentation renders it nigh unwatchable. My experience was greatly improved by skipping most of the cutscenes.\n\nTentative recommendation. If you LOVE warriors games, you'll like this, but poor presenation and lack of combo depth keep it from being straight up good (like Hyrule Warriors)","March 17","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From them using pretty much all the original Dragon Quest music to even some of the old sound effects. And when you pull off a large scale combo whilst your AI companions do the same and cause mass damage to the minions around you.\nAdmitedly it does have a few port issues, but this is Square Enix's first ever Action RPG to get a PC port within the same few weeks as the console version being release.\nSuch port issues are; You pretty much need a controller to play, you can play with a keyboard and mouse but it isn't easy to say the least.\nSome people are experiencing optimization issues (I say some as I haven't had any myself, but it is still apparent with some people).\nOther than that the game is just a really fun, neat game. Got a nice but simple crafting system for weapons and accesories, the characters are VERY well done, all having their own style of personalities and acents (Whaaaat?

It doesn't speak to Square Enix either as all 3 Final Fantaxy XIII games run fine.  I can't recommend this game.

Change your global settings to your NVIDIA card and then it'll run at the settings you expect.

The controls also don't map well to some controllers, hope they patch this.\n\nGraphics: Stunning and colorful, got the warning about needing to play in Win7 mode on W10, so far haven't had issues despite ignoring it, but this could be a dealbreaker on systems where it gives people fits regardless whether you heed the advice or not.\n\nNow, for why I recommend it:\n\nMusic: EXCELLENT. As a longtime DQ fan, I was in AWE over how well they remixed the music for an action game. They even retooled the original Dragon Quest 1 Battle Theme into something awesome for an action based game.\n\nGameplay: Plays a lot like Dynasty Warriors, but with a lot of Dragon Quest touches and features. The end result is quite enjoyable, and each character has their own strengths and weaknesses, which makes switching them stategic instead of merely to whichever one you are best skilled with, nice touch if you ask me. The Monster Medals aspect also adds some stategic depth to battles, done well if you ask me.\n\nStory: Won't win awards for originality (They cribbed a lot of notes from Warriors Orochi to make the crossover parts work), but the presentation is pretty good. Voice acting is excellent and continues the fine performance level as illustrated in Dragon Quest VIII. Also rather impressive how they manage to take the RPG geared aspects of Dragon Quest's core and married it to Dynasty Warriors action based format, this was done much better than I anticipated.\n\nConclusion: If you don't like Dragon Quest, but like Dynasty Warriors, you'll have fun if the DQ stuff doesn't turn you off too much. Conversely, if the more action based gaming doesn't turn you off, DQ fans will be in hog heaven from all the fanservice. If you just want a fun action game with cartoony graphics, this will satisfy on those counts.","December 25, 2015","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love how you guys have a whole integrated "run in compatability mode" option but don't bother fixing the issue with Nvidia mobile GPU's. Lazy that should reflect with negative reviews, you guys are lucky your fanbase is so loyal. Only recommend it if you're not running the game on a laptop with a Nvidia GPU.","February 12","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its your standard hack and slash Koei style at first glance but the fresh monster summoning mechanic and the crazy dragon quest monsters you have to fight make it 100times better.\n\n\nPros -\n- The story is square enix all over but if you love there stuff your going to get sucked in.\n- Combat is crazy good some might say repetitive but they must not be swapping it up enough.\n- Monster towers is a great I dear can change the whole flow of the game where you use what you have to summon. There are 2 types - sentry to guard pathways and fend off everything that comes their way and then the saviour which will either attack the enemy's and vanish or add elements to benefit yourselves. (this feature alone makes me think a pokemon crossover would be biblical)\n- Character selection - there is a lot of choice you will start the game and have to pick one main character out of 2 who will be your leader but once in battle you can chop and change between your 4 and they all have their own unique move sets.\n- The soundtrack and general effects are some of the best, I personal eat this stuff up even the menu screen has the ultimate dragon quest jolly tune.\n- Graphics have the nice DQ coat and the art style is what you would expect from a series of this calibre but don't be fooled the trailers do have a refined polish compared to the ingame look.\n- RPG elements are just right it has a nice town hub to take side quests in, buy new weapons and armour you can even go to the tavern to pick new characters to take to battle and then you have the monster suppression list and they have even integrated the achievements in game which is a nice touch that most games usually don't bother with.\n- Cut scenes are wonderful they always push the story forward and every time one comes about you know your getting close to finding a new character or fighting a epic boss monster and that refined polish make them look glorious.\n- Controls are fine had no issues I used a 360 remote so not sure how the mouse and keyboard players will find it but from a 360 point of view tight and responsive.\n- There are more pros with this game but ill be here all day listing them all so last pro would he helix what a legend.\n\nCons-\n- Win7 compatibility mode, I can only play this while set to this mode it did only mean me having to go to the DQ config launcher but I feel this shouldn't be happening in 2015 I understand its a port but I doubt it will ever be sorted.\n- Multiplayer has been left out on all levels, split screen or online would make this game gold standard its a real shame.\n- Pricepoint does seem a tad to much would have been nice to see it at 40euro but I get that all Koei ports cost a bomb.\n- Sink now im not sure if it because im in WIN7compat but the odd cutscene has gone out of sink and it can be a big gap if anyone else is having this problem you know it can be a good 4 to 6 second gap.\n\nOverall Im really happy I picked this up, its cons don't overshine the pros and we need more collaborations like this, It really is a fresh take on both sides. Its a game thats good for all ages if you love dragon quest you will very much enjoy this and if you love DW,SW Toukiden this is another must have to the collection. If you've never tried either game go watch a review you'll know if its your sort of thing.\n\n9/10 - Serious slash.","January 12","true","80.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat is near-mindless fun in a good way and the sound effects and the music will likely bring a smile to your face if you're a fan of Japanese RPG games. Even the voice acting is pretty good. The story for this game is much more than I was expecting. It's not incredibly deep as far as I've played just yet, but it's provided a level of depth I hadn't anticipated. Lastly, you don't see a lot of games on PC with this sort of whimsical charm with respect to character design and general presentation (even the menus), so the art style has been a breath of fresh air with respect to gaming on my PC.\n\nLoving it so far. It's definitely a step up from any of the Dynasty Warriors games in terms of overall polish.","January 2","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I always go into the DQ games thinking they are overwhelming. This game is like a breath of fresh air. Im not a huge koei kill 500000 enemies on screen kind of guy. This game has just the right amount of RPG elements, and the right amount of Dragon Quest Goodness. The branching leveling system is easy to use and fun to level to. The story can at times be a little lacking, but its hitting just the right spots for all my gaming needs. **As long as you are using a controller for this game**  You should be set for a grand adventure with returning characters from across the Dragon Quest Universe. Square said if we support this on steam more Dragon Quest games will be released on here. It worked for Final Fantasy, so lets push for Dragon Quest!! Really dont even think about it, just buy this gem and enjoy a really fun beat em up RPG!","June 1","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's mechanical difference is that it relies on a sort of "Tower Defense" aspect via summoning monsters to guard areas.\n\nThe problem is that these monsters are absolutely not able to protect any key areas or targets.\n\nYou also travel with companions that quite often are a burden and a hassle from your own carnage.\n\nBoth of these issues have the same general problem. The A.I is just not sophisticated enough to be of much help.\n\nHowever, the game is still fun if you like these types of games. The Dragon Quest fanservice is excellent, and the game looks like the cartoon world that Dragon Quest fans spent decades dreaming about.\n\nIf this didn't have the DQ license then I would say it's 4/10, but with the license it is a solid pick.","June 3","true","39.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Plenty of cutscene goodness, and lots of grinning while I was playing it.\nThe music is amazing, as a DQ fan I really enjoyed the music they\'ve taken from various games, and played by what sounds like a full orchestra and really well done.\nThe gameplay is fairly easy and fun - basically a defend this point/kill the boss/kill all the enemies type action game.\nI love the characters - they all have their own personality, probably from the games.  Can\'t wait to encounter the ones that I know.\nThe mediocre:\nHeal slime voice acting is a bit annoying\nThe missions feel very samey\nThe bad:\nPlaying with keyboard and mouse is annoying.\nThe tutorial shows the gamepad button prompts, so I\'ve got a note on my desk mapping the controller button to the keyboard/mouse key to what it actually does.\neg. X = Left Click = Attack 1\nB = mouse Scroll button = Attack 3/Coup de grace\nRB = Left CTRL = Access Spells\n\nIt's not unplayable, but a controller would be better.\nFinal verdict:\nA beautiful game that will bring back lots of good memories for DQ fans!

It is a game that you can play for FUN without having to thing too much about tactics or strategies, its pretty straight forward and simple. It looks nice, this is what you are paying for.
