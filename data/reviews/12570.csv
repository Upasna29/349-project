All your favourite nationalities and stereotypes are present.

If you are cooking a fried rice it is logical if you are able to cut the fishes first, or cut the vegetables first, both should not matter. But both should be cut before frying them. Thus, this game does it quite correct in mixing between linear and progressive when cooking.\n\nDegradation of materials\nThis is very weird. If you finish a food too fast, you will lose the quality of "materials" and your food quality, despite excellent cooking, will be reduced to nothing. And to finish your food in their best quality, all foods should be finished at the same time, to prevent "loss of materials". Strangely, to keep the materials fresh, all you need to do is chop or grill it. Very illogical. Don't you have some freezer or fridge while you are waiting? Also, which restaurant produce three main course at the same time?\n\nAlso, there is no explanation on each dish on what process they should take to finish, so you can time it well. Let's say, dish A requires 8 steps, dish B requires 4 steps. So, what you are going to do is finish dish A 4 steps, then synchronize ending with dish B. But in this game, you rely on blind luck.\n\nLow quality graphics\nEven Cooking Mama on Nintendo DS have better quality than this. If you simmer something, you don't "see" what is added. You don't really feel the vegetables that are put into the pan, or the sauce, or anything. The texture is very bad. I can go hungry after playing Cooking Mama on Nintendo DS, but not on this game.\n\nNo Progression\nIn this game, to progress a level you need to collect "stars" which is your quality of cooking. The stars could then be used to purchase new recipe. What is the benefit of purchasing new recipe? Nothing. There is no option to upgrade your store, or to put new things into the store, nothing. What's the benefit of getting new recipe? Just a new variation of cooking which you don't see well.\n\nI got this game from a bundle, but still, don't purchase this game.","July 1, 2015","false","0.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

Perhaps this is the audience the game is aimed for.  And for young girls it seems to work well. I've played through and to me it seemed a bit repetitive, but kids don't seem to be bothered by that and just enjoy it for what it is. No necessary reading skills, so language isn't important really. There are a lot of graphics that do the explaining when its needed. And the graphics are pretty good. I haven't seen problems with bugs although the low screen resolution is a bother, but my computer handles it just fine.\n\nIf you have girls 6 - 12 I would recommend this. And good games for girls are had to find.","October 12, 2015","true","21.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's basically one of those "use the mouse movements called for to complete the task" type of games. You do a LOT of clicking. There's isn't anything fancy or exceptional to it, sich as actually putting recipes together or anything, so don't get your hopes up too much. It could have been more, but it's not bad for what it is, if you like casual time management games.","January 8","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In career mode you just follow some simple recipes making pasta and pizza while building your portfolio.\n\nIt gets massively boring though since all the dishes require just a few ingredients. There will be an excessive amount of mouse clicking. All dishes are prepared with clicks and love.\n\nWorth $0.50 for a small child. (Who isn't smart.)\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

The worst part are the little controls that you imput when you're doing a complicated part of the cooking. Some just won't even recognize what you're doing. The stirring aspect when you're cooking food is completely broke though. Most of the time it barely registers that you're even doing the motion with your mouse. This pretty much makes it so you'll have lower star ratings for your dishes.","November 2, 2015","false","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There's also some match-3 going on from time to time. The tasks are fairly complex for a time-management game right off the bat, because you have to coordinate the different dishes, but it's still easy to get into.\n\nThe game runs at 800x600, and I had trouble getting my stirring properly recognized: for some of the sub-tasks, there is also very little feedback if you did them well, or what you'd need to improve if any. It is also difficult to memorize recipes since you don't do them in order, but you basically have to because dishes need to be done at the same time.\n\nThis may be a great game to have on your phone or tablet while waiting at the restaurant, but it didn't really impress me much as a PC game.","July 5, 2015","false","0.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"
