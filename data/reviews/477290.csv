It's running from the "Magma Tsunami" while dodging and jumping over obstacles. The aim of the game is to last as long as you can which shows the timer at the top.\n\nControls are basic. Move, Sprint and Jump with supports controllers.\n\nThe game itself will get progressively harder the longer you survive throwing a lot of objects your way with difficult platforms. Objects including birds, UFO's crashing down and ice cream to make you slip. At times you even have to use the UFO's to jump the next platform.\n\nIt has LOCAL multiplayer which in my opinion would be the highlight of the game of you want to compete with a friend or make a drinking game out of it (or anything similar)\n\nIt has a training mode which goes from "Normal, Hard, Extreme and Madness". It's the same just changing the difficulty.\n\nAlso includes a Highscore for 1 player and 2 player showing the dates and time you achieved.\n\nPros:\n+Good little game to kill some time\n+Can imagine it being fun with a local player\n+You\'re some humpty Dumpty thing running for his life.\n+Trading cards\n\nCons:\n-No online multiplayer\n-No online leaderboards\n-The beginning music began to drive me mad.\n-Achievements would be cool\n\nI don't expect much or even some of the cons that I mentioned as its only 55p. This is a sort of game you want to play for a little bit before doing something else.\n\nSurvive as long as you can, that\\\'s the only goal in this game, nothing more, but as I said, for the price, it's actually surprisingly fun! You don't exactly have much to lose.\n\nI've got a gameplay video here if you want to watch how it is and explained\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYNF-C-MpQ&feature=youtu.be","June 1","true","6.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

I personally love the music in this game!\n\nWhen I first oppened the game I found myself running from my death, and was wondering why the creators chose the player model that they did. Its kind of creepy but something I can fall in love with, not litterally I mean just liking it.\n\nThe game overall is pretty amazing for what you pay, I would reccomend it. (Ill probably find my self diving into the game every so often.)\n\nThe one thing that buggs me tho is that the game is called Magma Tsunami, even tho when you start the game you are not in the earth, the magma has reached a vent in the earth and somehow escaped so It\'s technically lava.\n\nOverall this game is pretty fun, I would say the creators should add new content, maybe even some DLCs!\n","June 1","true","0.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

It does accomplish that, but that isn\'t enough to make me want to play it again. I played it for about 10 minutes in a video for YouTube and I\'m pretty much done with it now. Not the worst $0.69 I have ever spent, but I wouldn\'t recommend it to someone just because its cheap.\n\nIf you are interested in seeing my video for the game so you can see what it is like more, here is a link to it: https://youtu.be/G_aDOdobLY8","June 1","false","0.7"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","4"
