You might think all of these reviewers suck at gaming and should jump of a bridge for sucking this hard at a 2D game. Well that's what i thought.\n\nYou'll start out as a man running around sucking up dirt, trees, grass and other junk. Once you got that outof the way you will start killing everything that moves, assuming every live thing in a game is hostile. You're having a great but confusing time.\n\nNext you'll start crafting stuff, a shotgun, a few wooden blocks and probably a turret or two. Then night starts to fall.\n\nYou don't think much of it so you'll just continue making yourself a little cottage. The night slowly grows darker.\n\nIt is pitch black, several enemies try to attack you and seem to be breaking through your new house! You fight them off with your shotgun and the sun rises again. It sure was one hell of a night.\n\nThe next day you start looking for the materials and resources you need to make the next thing you want, maybe armor or a flashlight. You encounter new animal species and annihilate them on the spot.\n\nNight falls and you rush back to your half destroyed home, quickly patch up the holes and get ready for another group of enemies. They won't catch you off guard this time.\n\nYou see the enemies coming, your turrets starts to shoot and off you go fighting for your life once again. You notice the new species you encountered seems to have joined the enemy army, but no fair match for your skill!\n\nSun rises once again and you rush out to collect and explore, ignoring the fact that you nearly died last night because you never had a second to look at your health bar. Time to annihilate new radioactive animals for pleasure and resource to get yourself a brand new shiny gun. Rather quickly sunset kicks in once again.\n\nNight has fallen and you're starting to lean back a little bit, assuming you'll see victory again. Many many more enemies come. The easy blue flying things and the dog-like kanines don't appear, but instead red flying beasts drilling through your house in a fraction of a second, feral beasts running at you, your turrets all destroyed almost in an instant and you surrounded by enemies, when suddenly...\n\nEverything stops. The foes charging at you casualy roam around the area. Then you realize you're not moving. Words appear on the screen saying: you are dead. You are dead.\n\nYou ♥♥♥♥ed up easy mode on the third night. You retry from the morning of day three trying to get more turrets, a better gun, healing kits, yet still you fail at night. You can't make it past night three.\n\nThis game is hard. Peaceful mode makes enemies harmless, easy mode rips your clothes off, bends you over and ravages your rear, tearing you a fist size dilation only to call you out for the ♥♥♥♥♥ you are and leaves you to rot in a ditch.\n\nIt'll take me some serious effort to learn how to not fail as quickly as i did.","March 12","true","1.1"," 114 of 127 people (90%) found this review helpful 74 people found this review funny","90","114","127","74","4"

An amazing little Side-Scroller Sandbox that's so cheap you just can't pass it up!\nVerdict - 7.3/10Scroll to the bottom for an Overall\n\n\n\nSandbox - 9/10:\nThe sandbox in this game is pretty much identical to any other Mine and Craft game out there. You need to mine resources in order to build a better Pickaxe (Or in this case a Gravity Gun?) which you can then use to dig up even higher tier resources to once again build a better Pickaxe (Sorry, Miniaturizor!). However, even though it may be identical it doesn't mean it's bad, it works well so why fix something that's not broken? The actual landscape itself - the stuff you'll be mining - is pretty bare at the moment. There's only two blocks in the actual world; Dirt and Stone (As far as I've dug at least) and I've only come across a few minerals and co.; Iron, Coal and Aluminium, with a couple of essentials dropped from monsters. Other than the caverns and the mountainous area there isn't really much that tells the landscape apart - which is a bit of a shame. Surprisingly, this game has really well made water physics, it rains (A lot!), the water builds up on the surface and pretty much floods everything, after a while it will get absorbed into the ground again sinking into the earth. It's extremely dynamic and really adds to the feel of the world. Unlike typical Sandbox games the Saving system in this game is different - you revert back to your last save instead of respawning.\n\n\nCombat - 8/10:\nWhilst the weapons are limited there's a pretty cool thing you can do with them, they launch the player back when fired - some more than others - and when you're in the air you can go flying. It's great to use the shotgun as a little 'jet-pack boost' and makes the movement of the game flow really well. As I mentioned before; this game has a high emphasis on Base Defence, every night you'll be attacked by monsters which not only can kill you but also break your entire base while they're at it. You can build turrets to help protect your base (Which for some reason they don't try to attack) which are alright but nothing great. The game can get very difficult, especially if you don't know what you're doing (I recommend you read the "Quick Help" section before you start), there are a couple of Cheese Tactics you can do but I won't spoil them for you, Sandbox games are meant for exploring!\n\n\nGraphics - 7/10:\nThe graphics look a little tacky but the reason I've given it a 7 is because they remind me of the old Newgrounds days where almost every single game looked like this. It brought some fond memories of some great games and it may do the same for you.\n\n\nAudio - 5/10:\nThe game sounds are alright at best, there aren't many things in this game that actually make sound - other than your Gun and the monsters shooting at you. If it wasn't for the great background music I would have rated it much lower. The game lacks ambience, and as a result really lacks any real atmosphere. The background music may be good but there definitely needs to be more tracks too.\n\n\nOverall - 7.3/10\nI've had a great load of fun with this game and for £2 (Or $3) it's an absolutely steal (Price will increase over time to £8 (Or $12) - get it while it's cheap!). Whilst it may have some bad points, it's still early days and I hope the developers use Early Access to it's fullest and make the true potential of this game a reality.\n\n\n\nGameplay and Commentary:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWVXKzPnmgc\n\n\nLink to my YouTube Channel.\nLink to my Twitter Page.\n{LINK REMOVED} Link to my Blog.\nLink to my Curations.","April 30, 2015","true","10.0"," 98 of 113 people (87%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","87","98","113","6","6"

Its unique mechanics sets it apart from Terraria, and so it is worthy of attention even from Terraria veterans.\n\nThe two prominent unique mechanics are: liquid and structural physics. Water not only flows down and fills up space, it exerts pressure to surrounding blocks. Building blocks have structural strength, so they can crumble under pressure. No longer can you dive into the ocean, dig a chamber, create a one block thick seal, and 'mine' the water out to start a dry underwater tunnel. Do that in this game, and the sealing blocks will crumble and your tunnel will be flooded, just as it would in real life.\n\nStructural integrity will also apply to buildings. You will not be able to create a high one block wide tower with platforms on the side, or that stair structures you used so many times in the other games, because your lower blocks would crumble under the weight. A long one block bridge, highway in the sky? Snap! You get the idea.\n\nThis game is pretty much under the development, so you will be able to learn these and other features as the game develops. By the time this game came out of Early Access, you will be master at managing water pressure and structural integrity.\n\nI will give this game a score of 8/10.","May 2","true","1.1"," 59 of 61 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","59","61","0","4"

I feel as this gets closer to release it will be a 10/10.\n\nPros:\n- Fun graphics (guy jumps like old school megaman)\n- Lots of content. (tons of varied enemies, bosses, etc)\n- Zero bugs. game never crashes, solid physics engine, water behaves rationaly, etc\n- Fun progression. No grinding, just fun exploring. You can not kill new types of enemies to keep the game from progressing to harder levels if you feel in over your head.\n-  It's like terraria and Craft the World, with biomes and underwater bases. If you like that type of game this will be most enjoyable for you.\n- Price/Value. Right now the game is $4.99 which is an incredible value for what you get.\n- Lovely music/sound effects\n- Great base defense and tower defense type setup.\n\nCons: (being picky as this game is pretty flawless)\n- The ships computer in the beginning of the game kinda cheats (scans) and tells you where to find everything, if you want a challenge don't listen to him.\n- The overcharge cannon has such a high kickback you keep donking your head and sometimes die.\n- So many enemies come at night digging at you that you frequently create large underground spaces. Would like the AI to better use existing passages and not dig the entire world up trying to get at you. Just bugs me having a base floating there with no rock or passages around it.\n\nI dunno maybe it's because I just got done playing Skyshines Bedlam, which was $20 and had 1/16th the content this $5 game has and also was a complete steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥, I'm now biased. But Dig or Die is an absolute delight to play and incredibly fun. I'm completely hooked and haven't had this much fun in ages. I haven't been this excited about a game since Ori and The Blind Forest. You know when it's hard, but not so hard you say "screw this" and you just stay up till the wee hours of the morning playing it? That's the type of addicting game this is. Whether it's prefecting you underwater base and getting your safety airlocks in place, or building a rikity bridge across a chasm trying to discover new riches, the game is constantly fun. I can't say enough good things about it.\n\nWith so many ealry access games out there ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off with bugs, lack of content, glitches, crashes, and you name it. This game shines like a uranium nugget in the swamp biom (sorry inside game joke).\n\nJust buy it now, thank me later.","September 28, 2015","true","15.7"," 56 of 57 people (98%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","98","56","57","9","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sephiroththephoenix/recommended/315460/","Sephiroththephoenix","Seph","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sephiroththephoenix/","55 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA lot of these reviews don't really say why this game is a hidden gem. The developer really deserves the money he gets from this- 5$ gets you more than what you pay for. This isn't a game for everybody, though. It requires lots of planning and management to survive at harder difficulties, but on easy and normal you can be a bit more relaxed. It's a somewhat short game, but what do you expect from early access? The developer takes suggestions on how the game could be better or what items would be cool, so if you feel like this game is missing one amazing item, just say so in the discussion thread!\n\nExploration and material gathering is needed, which can get tedius at times, but you'll pretty much be constantly on your toes with enemies you can easily take out, but doing so will kill you at nighttime. The fact that you have to worry about night makes you have to plan out your adventures carefully and sparingly. Returning home early is better than returning later at night and dying.\n\nA major fun-factor is how you can boost your jumps and movements just by shooting your plasma weapons (Shotgun is best for this) in the opposite direction when you jump, effectively using the knockback to get to hard-to-reach places, for fighting tactics (I love to just boost above a firefly, fall down and just blast that sucker straight into the ground) and to reduce fatal fall damage to nothing.\n\nWater is a very restricting factor in this game- at one point in time you'll have your main cave blocked out by water, causing you to find the source of the problem and plug it up or plan out how you can use your time sparingly underwater unless you want to meet an untimely death. Even your base is prone to floods if you don't plan it out carefully!\n\nNow the enemies are something else. Want a new miniaturizor that will mine things faster? Well, you're going to have to prepare yourself, because that firefly you need to kill for it sure isn't going to go easy on you. Need some aluminum, but don't want to die by these tough enemies at nighttime? Well, you're going to have to move around them or avoid them outright. Running away is always an option, but make sure they don't dig out a path towards you right when you think you're safe.\n\nDefense is fun as hell. You'll spend a lot of time figuring out what turrets work best in what areas. More area coverage means less enemies your turrets have to deal with at a time, but that means more management and costs for keeping them up- and by that, I mean that enemies will target your turrets and go full kamakazi if they so choose, getting at least a couple shots off your turret in the hopes that their friends will take it out.\n\nThe music is also really nice. The nighttime music is upbeat while the daytime music is nice and chill.  There are a lot of different tracks, which reduces repetitiveness by quite a bit.\n\nNow here's the big factor- replay ability. It's a sandbox game, so this is an extremely important in buying it. I'm going to be honest here: This game is straightforward and very lenient. After a couple of playthroughs, you'll know exactly what to do after you get this item and the game will get somewhat boring because the enemies feel similar like the fireflies. The only time the replay ability shines is trying out different base designs and the world regeneration, but other than that, there's nothing too special about it.\n\nSo overall, a 7/10 for an early access game. The game gets boring after a little bit, which is something the dev should focus on a bit more when he can. The first time experiencing might be a bit confusing, but fun and interesting. The graphics aren't too special, but they're getting a makeover in v0.2, so I'm excited for that. The weapons are diverse and fun, but the only time you get really fun weapons is when there's nothing much left to do in the game. I just love how unique this concept is, and I'm excited to see how this game will develop in time. The developer seems to be constantly updating it, which will in turn make this game cost more, but for now this game is worth it! After all, this is still in early access.","December 6, 2015","true","64.2"," 47 of 48 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","47","48","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lavode/recommended/315460/","Lavode","Jhereg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lavode/","243 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI'll be honest. I was a terraria addict for a long time. Then came Starbound, and I was smitten with that too. There were times I wanted to take the building tool for Starbound and give it to Terraria and other such things.\n\nI wasn't sure what I was expecting when I started Dig or Die.  The graphics are very simliar, but the playstyle is very different. The basic concept, dig stuff up, build things, survive the night. That's all there, but Dig or Die adds a few things. One of those things is water. Water pouring down from the heavens and flooding your base because you forgot to plug that hole that radioactive alien firefly punched into the dirt to come eat your face the night before...\n\nThis game instills paranoia. Water paranoia. There is also that moment of "oh crap did I kill something on accident with my plasma rife?!" and the moment when 50 angry friends of his come to stomp you into the dirt when night falls. That's paranoia right there.\n\nThere that frustration that the game has physics, but it is also a sort of love/hate relationship that makes the game it's own thing. You can't just pile up bricks forever. Eventually, that tower has to have support or it's coming down. You can't build a bridge without supports. You have repair walls that took damage or there is a good chance that the night waves will say hello through the hole in your wall.\n\nOverall, this game  had a very satisfying feel to it, despite it being early access. I happen to really enjoy the soundtrack and hope there will be more from said composer. Best of all, the devs are active on their discussion board, and they even had time to answer my noob questions (from the gal that literally has only been playing this game for 19.9 hours according to steam...) as well as l isten to my suggestions from a new players standpoint. That's the kind of thing I like to see, and that makes the modest price-tag on this game worth every  penny.","January 7","true","27.7"," 45 of 48 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","45","48","4","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/knetic/recommended/315460/","knetic","K!netic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/knetic/","300 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is a game that seems to have watched what people didn't like about other sandbox games, and worked extremely hard to avoid those problems. Jumping into the game, it's clear that this game doesn't intend to waste your time. The menus and overall feel are extremely smooth and quick. This seems to permeate the whole game's design; don't waste the player's time, let them do what they want, and look good doing it.\n\nTo start, most sandbox games take forever to mine a block. This one doesn't. And while the time it takes to mine a dirt or stone block decreases with better tech levels, it never feels  arduous to cut through a mountain or dig a tunnel. Which I think is fantastic in a game that's about digging tunnels. Your character occupies one block of space, and it takes under a second to mine one block.\n\nAfter playing a bit, you get to the "building" part, which is even simpler. The game dispenses with the idea of you manually putting down blocks of dirt that you picked up. Instead, you mix concrete and place *that*. It's one of about five basic block types you can place. While that seems limiting, it's actually freeing. I've never enjoyed making dirt palaces with haphazard streaks of cobblestone and sand. It lets you focus on the stuff you actually want to do; dig tunnels, get resources, craft new things, and fight monsters.\n\n(spoilers ahead)\nBut the real treat comes when you're told to go westward to pick some flower if you want to craft the next tier. while the world itself is randomly generated, there's a giant chasm in the west, cut straight through the ground. You need to build a bridge over it in order to cross, but it's not as simple as just laying down concrete - if a structure is too unbalanced or too much weight is placed on one block, the whole thing falls apart. You're forced to design a bridge that can cross the chasm. Similarly, there are floating islands that contain a mineral you need for a different tier - and you have to build a tower to reach them. While these are fairly scripted things to do, it felt surprisingly good to be given a well thought-out challenge in a building game, yet still have the feel of random generation and freedom.\n\nWhile this game may not last forever, it gives you a great experience for a few hours, and seems to respect you as a player. It knows you've seen it all before, but it knows you quit playing those other sandbox games for a reason - and it's determined not to have those same problems.","March 21, 2015","true","4.1"," 40 of 41 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","40","41","3","1"

Before that you could get off planet in the space of an in game week with ease ending the game. Now there are bosses to fight, more areas to explore with materials and things to craft from them and the promise of more to come. Patches at the moment are very frequent and tend to be not much more than a few kilobytes.\n\nThe game has an interesting way of pacing the difficulty which is explained by the ai computer in the wreckage beside you at the starting point. This happens in a couple of ways. One is that at night creatures become hostile and will be even more inclined to want to chew your face off than during the day. The other that some people might miss out on is that creatures only become hostile if you start killing them first. So if you run and gun during the first day there's a good chance that come nightfall death will follow.\n\nYou know those games about building a bridge on a tight budget where you end up making something from girders and knicker elastic? In some ways that is similar to how building works in dig or die. The higher you build the more stress blocks get and once they get too much things will collapse. So with the exceptions of floating islands having a skybase a la terraria isnt possible. Thankfully you can craft goggles that will show stresses when they're on the hotbar that make things a bit easier.\n\nThere's also rain, more than the average scottish summer, and that brings some changes as well. Digging requires a bit more thought as some tunneling habits will lead to death by drowning. The good news is that the water can be controlled and used for power or just flooding the world to save building up to the islands overhead.\n\nWeaponary comes in handy for both killing stuff, obviously, as well as mobility. Rocket jumping isnt a new concept in video games, strangely enough the rocket launcher isnt the best for it in DoD, but a lot of the weapons have a knockback to them which means if you need a boost to cross a gap shooting down will give you the nudge needed. Sililarly if you're swimming in the ocean and start running out of air shooting down can get you to the surface faster.\n\nValue wise, one playthrough from start to getting off planet should easily get you below the £1 per hour mark. Currently on around 30p per hour and falling so in the realms of witcher 3's levels of cost per hour.\n\nAnd one last thing that I really like is that, unlike terraria, you aren't forced into looking at a wiki to find out what to do next. All the info you need to play is in the tooltips or mentioned by the crashed ai. It might not say specifically where to go for the black grass but it's easy enough to figure out black dirt is involved.","August 12, 2015","true","27.6"," 37 of 39 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","37","39","2","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Asvarduil/recommended/315460/","Asvarduil","Asvarduil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Asvarduil/","46 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOnce upon a time, an interstellar salesman went station-to-station, selling the AwesomeMatic 2000 matter reprocessor!  It slices!  It dices!  It performs molecular restructuring, and YOU can have it for only 2000 Space Dollars!  After this brilliant, and original sales pitch, however, the salesman found out the hard way they tried cold-selling the wrong person.  Captain Benjamin "Don't F@#$ With The" Sisko punched them in the throat so hard, they crash-landed on a remote jungle planet.\n\nDig Or Die is a neat little block-building game in the vein of StarBound, Terraria, MineCraft, and all of the clones spawned thereof.  The first thing that's apparent after starting the game, is the influence.  This game appears to draw significant aesthetic influence from Mega Man - not Metroid like Terraria does, or the Cthulhu Mythos like both Terraria and MineCraft do.  As a result, the game has a very retro feel, in a good way.\n\nWhat Works\nAlso, the game is very difficult, but in a (mostly) good way.  The early game sucks.  You have crappy tools, no facilities, and have to hastily cobble together some form of shelter before the thankfully-super-short night falls, and you get beset by waves and waves of monsters.  I've died a couple of times so far before I've gotten the second-level workbench, but not in a "BS" way - usually I die because the game is asking something of me, and I didn't do it.\n\nWhat makes it more difficult, but also a deeper game, is you can't build structures that are sustained by videogame logic.  Nonono.  If you want a roof on your structure, you need to build supports.  Walls are helpful.  Also, monsters do damage individual blocks, which means by night the packs of wolves and space-bats can tear down a side of your carefully constructed base.  Even if that doesn't happen, failure to properly reinforce your buildings and placing one block too many causes part of your building to fall down...causing you to need to put it all back in place again.  As a gamer used to video game logic, this is both incredibly refreshing, but also something that I find I've gotten used to not considering as much as I should.\n\nFurther - point defenses.  Something Terraria and MineCraft just don't have.  You absolutely have to use point defenses to protect your structures...but they do have their limits!  Still the presence and use of point defenses to protect your structures during night brings up on big point that the game does well - unlike most block-buildy games, everything is useful.  Even the Dirt.  Especially the Dirt - Dirt is a prime component of Concrete, a reasonably resilient material that has good structural properties.\n\nWhat Doesn't Work\nOn the one hand, I don't want to cast my vote too early - and make no mistake, this game is in early access.  It has a good ways to go before I consider this a completed game.  That being said...critique time.\n\nThe game's balance is off - the initial difficulty curve is simply too high for my tastes.  While everything above is a strength, it's expressed in the most painful way possible.  Certain monsters like the fish regenerate HP more quickly than you can damage them, leading me to be very hydrophobic in this game.  The monsters for some reason can tear down your wood/concrete walls.  Digging through dirt, I understand.  But wolves, spacebats, and fishes headbutting concrete until it breaks?  That's an innovation only videogame logic could pull off.\n\nThe visuals need some work - the Mega Man aesthetic is neat, but poorly realized, and lacks cohesion between various elements, particularly the game and the UI.  Speaking of the UI, the UI does not scale well at all - the only setting I can reasonbly play the game on is 1366x768; at 640x480 Windowed the UI is unusably small.  Also on the note of scale, the blocks being as large as the player feels off too.  I usually expect the player to be larger than a single block.  The game would work better if the player were 1x2 blocks, and all enemies were about 50% larger.\n\nSpeaking of the UI, the in-game UI is very awkward.  There are more item hot-slots than there are top-row keyboard keys, which means you're obliged to use your mouse scrollwheel to be able to select items (of which you get a lot.)  Now, this wouldn't normally be so bad - after all, it's close to how I play Terraria.  Where things go downhill, is that the inventory UI itself is very unlike anything else in the block-buildy genre.  I find myself expecting a grid of items I own - uncategorized - but instead of the inventory UI being helpful as it's no doubt intended, it feels wrong.  This may be personal bias, but I think this game's inventory/hotbar system actually breaks the established genre interface, thus making the experience feel more off than it should.\n\nThe TL;DR\nAt $4.99, in this early phase of development, with the good points and problems all factored in...this game is worth it.  I forsee it only getting better as it catapaults to, and past the 1.0 version.  As long as the developer remains engaged, and keeps putting great effort into this game, I think they've made a game that beats a lot of its competion in the Sci-Fi Block Buildy genre - especially StarBound and Edge of Space.\n\nI will update this review as the game evolves further.","October 28, 2015","true","1.9"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","34","36","4","4"

When you get deeper into the game you start the base build part of the game (My fav part), you will need a brain for this or lots of real life experience with it.\n\nThe Graphics\nThe looks of the game are great for a one man team, not saying they are bad, but could use upgrading. I understand that the developer of the game is looking for a graphic artist during the making of this review so upgrades are on its way. (Update) New Graphics are now avaliable.\n\nThe Updates\nThe developer is putting his heart and soul into this game. With every update (As of this review the updates have been coming out once every 2-3 months) you can see the effort that the developer is putting into the game. The developer has also said that he plans to input multiplayer so if you want a game that is fun and will get better soon, this one would be a great investment.\n\nThe AI\nThe AI of the game is well balanced making the game fair on every level you play on it feels real (Peaceful feels peaceful, easy feels easy, normal feels normal, hard feels hard and so on).\n\nThe Realism\nThe realism of the games physics are fantastic. This feature really makes you need to think whenever you build, what do I need to get this done? How do I get this done? And will it work? This game is a real pain when something just does not want to work.\n\nThe Cons\nThere are not many cons to this game but just to balance the review here are some:\nIt’s made by only one person so updates take a while.\nIt’s not multiplayer (However this is coming soon)\nThe water in the game is a pain (This is part of what also makes it fun though)\nAnd.... wow.... can't think of much else...\n\n\nShould I Buy This?\nIn the end it’s up to you, but I do recommend this game. Hopefully this review has also helped you make up your mind on the matter of buying this game.\n\nRating\nI don't quite know how much I should rate this game but I guess it would be something like 8 or so.\n\n8.2343123/10","April 30","true","29.2"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","30","32","3","0"

If you're not careful, you'll be swarmed with Bees,\nWolves (I think), 'Dwellers', among other monsters. As you craft better items, the monsters seem to upgrade themselves, until the point where each monster can overpower you, unless your paying close attention. This makes for some truly outstanding gameplay, especially since the monsters can mine blocks.\nAlso: Physics. Things collapse if they do not have enough support, etc. It's awesome.\nI think the best way to describe this, is that it's pretty much a mixture of Starbound and Risk of Rain.

Trust me, this is far from your ordinary sandbox. Oh, and I would like to state that while being inspired by a game like Terraria, it is vastly different and a heck of a lot more difficult.\n\nHere is a little background. Dig or Die is a game released in March 2015 by Gaddy Games. You are a representative for a space-based company called Craft & Co. and have crash landed on a hostile planet, leaving you stranded with no way to get out besides using the equipment manufactured by the company to survive and ultimately build a rocket ship to escape.\n\nWhen you load up a new world, your gaming instincts will kick in and you will have the urge to kill every creature in sight, but let me warn you that if you do, it will make the game an astronomical amount harder than if you just mind your own business. Of course you will have to kill some things anyway for crafting materials and other stuff, but if you haven’t killed any of its kind and have no reason to, then try to resist the urge to obliterate it with your pulse rifle.\n\nIf you are wondering why I am warning you about this, it is because at night the enemies come as a wave of creatures trying to get their revenge. Basically, different types of creatures will attempt to kill you if you have killed said type of creature. For example if you kill a dog, more dogs will attack you. If you kill a giant blue wasp, waves of giant blue wasps will attack you, which leads to my next point.\n\nDefense is a major part of Dig or Die, especially when - as I’ve stated above - the monsters attack in a big wave. You must build a fortified base that hopefully you can survive in by using turrets, sturdy walls and your nifty craft-o-tron to help build these. Be careful though, because the hostile creatures that your base so desperately defends you from can and will tear your base apart, so be prepared to repair things! Also keep an eye out for blocks that are holding up large amounts of other blocks as this game enforces the laws of physics and they, also, crumble apart.\n\nSomething I would like to point out is that there are quite frequent flash floods, which add a great deal to the game’s suspense and makes it even more difficult as your base can be flooded in a matter of seconds. This is another thing you should look out for, so just a tip: build drainage pipes!\n\nThe game works somewhat in tiers, where you start with MK I gear and try to go up through the ranks to get better equipment, to venture further and get more items to craft better stuff and survive for longer. Eventually, you will have climbed the ladder of better items and will be able to create the rocket ship that I mentioned earlier, which is where the game ends.\n\nThe game’s art style is incredibly beautiful, being what you would imagine from a cartoon-styled game set in an alien planet. The animations can seem jittery and not-so-smooth, but if you are not paying lots of attention to them there isn’t really much of a problem.\n\nThe music and sound effects feel very fitting to the game’s atmosphere. I have had a few encounters where the music stops altogether when a sound effect plays and doesn’t start again until another sound effect plays, usually when I shoot my pulse rifle, but that is only a very small issue that I have come across and haven’t seen anyone else complain about it, so it could just be for me.\n\nIn conclusion, Dig or Die is a brilliant game. There may be some issues here and there, but in the end the game is a great play and for the price it is, I wouldn’t think twice about recommending it to any friend who enjoys 2D sandboxes.\n\nI rate Dig or Die 8.5/10 hungry dingos.","May 14","true","1.9"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","30","36","5","0"

And I mean it.\n-Rain physics.\n\nCons:\n-Enemies WILL overwhelm you on playthrough one.\n-Building physics take getting used to.\n-Released like a week ago, so may be unbalanced/not enough content at the moment.\n-Indie (Lower funding/Less employees than triple A studios, so dev time may be longer)\n-It has an ending within only a few hours (Will probaby get longer as development goes on).\n-Night starts to feel much more pathetic, and the shortness of it gets annoying, once you get high tier items. I often find myself wishing for a gamemode with a 15-20 minute setup, then an infinite night. Or at least customizeable timers.\n-Rain. Physics.\n\nBasically, this game is Terraria mixed with Xenominer mixed with **some game that requires you to escape a planet** (Shut up, I couldn't think of anything)\n\nSo let's start with my first playthrough.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNOTE: This CAN, and WILL, spoil your first playthrough. STOP READING NOW if you have already decided to purchase it. Trust me, the first playthrough is so much more fun blind.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(Note 2: I'm refraining from mentioning any part of rain or water in my playthroughs, because it's basically everywhere, all the time. No need to tell you that it rains every minute. It hardly affected me this early into the game.)\n\nI immediately charged to the far right side, thinking like a terrarian, trying to explore everything. Within seconds I encountered yellow flying bugs and yellow dogs. No big deal, super weak, killed them with ease. Went farther, and after about a minute, I found a black colored variant of the flying enemies. It took ages to kill with the starter weapon. Unfortunately, here's where I had issues. I read nothing in the quick help menu, and only listened to the AI for a short while. So when I decided to bunker down for the night, I didn't realise what I had brought upon myself.\n\nContext: The game's difficulty curve is technically one that you control. You will only get assaulted at night by enemies that you killed during the day.\n\nI didn't know that.\n\nWithin seconds there was an absolute HORDE of the black flying enemies. I had only a few concrete walls (which stood no chance) and one weak turret (RIP) in between me and unescapeable death. It was over in 20 seconds. I had no chance. Luckily, I had thought to quicksave... after I had killed the black flying enemy.\n\nSo on to my second playthrough. I learned pretty fast. Only killed the yellow flying enemy and yellow dogs for the first few nights while I built up. Then the AI clued me into some flowers to the west to get my T3 autocrafter. So I immediately went east, like the smart man that I am.\n\nTo the west: Red flying enemies, the next step up from the yellow ones. Not easy, but not difficut either.\n\nI made a mistake.\n\nI went east and found the black ones again. Figured me, my 12 turrets, and my 3-thick concrete walls could take take them.\n\nI was wrong. Again.\n\nI lasted nearly until morning that time. But by halfway through the night there were droves of them. It felt like a bombing run. I was down to 3 turrets which I had hastily evacuated to my basement. They were busy with all manner of dogs that I killed during the day (Higher tiers than the yellow, but dogs don't hurt nearly as much as the flying enemies), which left me valiantly defending against the fliers.\n\nIt went well for about 3 minutes. Then the dogs broke through the turrets.\n\nWith just me and my getling gun left in that hole-filled basement, I went down again.\n\nAnd I made the mistake of autosaving just before nightfall again. 2 more attempts got me no closer to daytime.\n\nI've yet to start a third playthrough. I'm trying to plan my house on paper beforehand this time, decide choke points, where the walls should be thicker, thinner, supported, where to place turrets, where to place lights, where to place myself, and all other things I can think of. But I can say without a doubt that this game is challenging.\n\nAnd I'm only on Easy. There's still 4 higher difficulty levels.\n\nTime to get crackin'.","March 15, 2015","true","5.5"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","19","20","4","0"

Remember being stuck outside with no base to speak of in Minectraft, Terraria and the like? the next day after hopefully not dying over and over again you build a base then..... nothing. Terraria added some nifty features with zombies knocking on doors and breaking them down and Minecraft has mods but none that feel like this game.\n\nNever mind the awesome physics or the quick and easy crafting system it was the base defense and path-finding mobs that made me fall for this game. I've been a fan of the tower defense genre as well as sandbox games and too see them together, but more importantly, to see them put together well, I was amazed. Remember your first night in Dig or Die?\n\nI had diggin into the side of the hill my spaceship had landed on. i dug in deep with my 2 turrets and shotgun which i had the the luck of killing enough fireflys to craft and enough scrap for iron. i had watched some videos so i knew what to expect. leaving a hole for the mobs to come in i felt safe..... i was wrong. they came from below and both sides, within moments i was running, screaming like a little girl trying to dig deeper to avoid the continuous stream on monsters trying to devour me. Its safe to assume i didn't make it and i will now admit that was my 3rd first night.\n\nPlay this game and you'll like it!\n\nAlso i would like to note the replay ability of this game, its a sandbox so each time try something different and learn something new. My hat is off to the developer, you sir have made my day and many more to come.\n\nMy input for the game would only be a harder survival mode. Not just stronger mobs, but make them dig, walk, shoot, strike better based off of how many in day games you've been around. Once you've built the best base you can where everything repairs and lasts the night what then.... sure you can leave the planet but what if you want to stay!","March 24, 2015","true","15.7"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","2"

You're free to do whatever you want, however, as the enemy progression in the game is cleverly tied into the exploration.\nEvery night you're assaulted by rabid creatures that want to rid the planet of your presence, but the only ones that attack you are species you've already killed a member of.\nThe bases you build are basically just forts with one singular purpose: to keep you alive at night, There're a myriad of traps and turrets available to choose from, and each is useful in its own way. As you advance up the tech tree, more toys become available to help protect you against the new & nastier enemies you've angered to get there.\n\nFinally, I'll talk a bit about the water physics.\nThe water is this game is the best implementation of it I've seen in any crafting game ever. While it's a bit overexaggerated in it's flow and abundance, it otherwise behaves just as you expect water should.\nThe game simulates pressure, flow and absorbtion to a very impressive degree. Massive rainfalls ensure you always have to contend with it, or have your bases and mines flooded. Dirt will absorb water into it, which is released underneath it or when broken. Mining underwater is a hazard due to the inability of crafting air pockets, as the water pressure pushes the surface upwards.\nYou can also harness the water for use with hydroelectric dams and pumps, and managing the flow of water to your advantage is a constant concern.\n\nPhysics is also applied to forced acting on the blocks you place.\nWhile underground this is a non-issue, as the blocks are always supported by the background layer, but above ground (and other places where there's no background layer) you have to consider thw weight and resistance of the blocks you place, or the whole construction will come crashing down.\nI kinda wish it'd simulate the different kinds of material stresses better, as even concrete cannot stand vertical towers for very high before it just bursts, but at least it provides an engineering challenge.\n\nSo:\nIn summary, Dig or Die is a fun little crafting game focusing on survival and tower defense elements in a (partially) physics driven hostile world.\nI had fun with it, and for the pricetag you could certainly do a lot worse.\nIt's a charming little game, with some cool engineering puzzles to solve and fun combat.\nOh, and the battle music kicks ♥♥♥ ;)","May 5","true","16.9"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

You essentially have 3 "levels" to get through. Each level is dependent on how far you upgrade a core piece of equipment (similar to a workbench in other games). And then there are the enemy levels which scale according to how far you explore; spend your first day going as far across the map as possible and you will die horribly come night.\n\nThat's one of the ways this game sets itself apart from some of the others like it. There is a serious and real threat to you. It takes a page out of 7 Days to Die's playbook and throws a real challenge at you when night comes. Every enemy you've encountered swarms around you or your base come nightfall. Gives you a real reason to set up some good defenses!\n\nAnd these aren't mindless zombie drones we're talking about. Even though their options are limited, the enemies will use whatever means at their disposal to get to you... directly to you, even if it means tearing down 12 feet of concrete block.\n\nPhysics (to a degree) are another factor that make it different. I'd also compare this to 7 Days to Die in that each material has a different strength to support other blocks; build up too high or out too far and your walls will crumble over.\n\nThe third and last, that I personally really like, it water. Water can either be your best friend or worst enemy in this game. It flows, it settles, it gets absorbed, it pools... it drowns. Just the moisture from the dirt around you will be enough to flood a mineshaft if you don't plan it carefully. It's the same problem miners face in real life and so far, it's the only game that tries to replicate that.\n\nThis game took me completely off-guard. There was no hype around it. There were no ads on Steam for it. I didn't even see any previews for it anywhere on the Internet. And at $2.99 at the time of this review, how can you ever possibly go wrong??\n\nConsidering the one-man dev team has already updated it once after a week of release and is also an active member of the community, I can see this as being one of the games that may actually live up to its promises... a rarity for a lot of these titles!","March 14, 2015","true","81.1"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","1"

Dig or Die is a much more 'conservative' take on a Terraria-esque game; most importantly to me, it has an endgame goal that is presented to you at the begining, and a cohesive art/ambient theme. No clowns and laser guns mixed with battle-axes here. The artwork is very nice, as well - less pixel art this time. It feels much more reserved, than 'in-your-face' considering its pastel colors and mellow music.\n\nEssentially, you crash land on a planet, and need to gather the resources to both protect yourself as well as get off the planet. It has various difficulty levels, but proves challenging at even 'easy'. Its really easy on the eyes and things all make fairly logical sense. The menus are intuitive enough. There is also some mild tower defense elements that are quite welcome.\n\nMost of all, the price is right - five bucks is too low, in fact, for the content you are given.","October 20, 2015","true","1.6"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","21","27","3","0"

Dig Or Die differentiates itself from Terraria by taking the Terraria formula and emphasizing tower defense and construction elements while significantly compacting the experience.\n\nIn Dig Or Die, you play a man who has crashed on an alien planet and must build a rocket ship to escape. You do this by collecting resources and gradually climbing up the tiers of a crafting system until you can build a rocketship and leave the planet. You'll have to survive until then and when nighttime comes that's when the party arrives. Nights in Dig Or Die are short but brutal. The player is swarmed by monsters and the best course of action is to build a base with several turrets because even if you have state-of-the-art firearms it won't be easy taking out the enemies by yourself.\n\nTower defense is a large part of Dig Or Die. The main challenge throughout the game will be surviving the nights as increasingly difficult enemies attack you during nightfall. The game allows you to control how quickly the game's night assault difficulty increases by only adding in a type of enemy into the night defense roster after you've killed it during the daytime in its natural habitat. Turret construction will also come in use when you are fighting bosses because chances are your weapons won't be killing them quick enough.\n\nThe other big gimmick with Dig Or Die is the construction physics. Anything that's not built in front of a natural background wall will have to abide to the game's complex physics systems. You cannot just simply build a pillar of blocks to the sky, no. The player will have to build eventually because some biomes (and therefore, some crucial resources) are trapped away beyond neverending chasms and the like. It's a very satisfying puzzle, building these constructions and this reviewer enjoyed it a lot even though sometimes it was hard to understand how weight distribution worked.\n\nOne thing that doesn't get mentioned enough is how Dig Or Die plays with spectacle. Finding new biomes and new enemies is very thrilling and its pretty surprising how deep you can dig down into the earth. Your journey will take you to some very exciting places and there are all sorts of surprises to uncover, at a pacing that sets it ahead of Terraria.\n\nIn conclusion, those looking for a briefer and quicker Terraria-like experience with heavy defense elements and a construction system that provides interesting puzzles should give Dig Or Die a purchase.","May 16","true","44.7"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

You are stranded, shipwrecked on a foreign planet. You have some tools to use at your disposal and some scrap materials from your shipwreck. Along with your ship's AI, you develop a plan to scavenge to try and discover a method to get off this wretched planet. But like all epic tales, what begins as simple quickly turns to a battle between life or death. If you were a fan of Terraria, Edge of Space, Starbound and similar gathering and crafting 2d survival games, this is certainly up your alley. But this time, you will have to Dig or Die.\n\nDo you have what it takes? This game succeeds in differentiating itself from the rest, and had me on the edge of my seat at many moments. I suggest you pick up this title and find out.  Two thumbs up.","June 18, 2015","true","3.7"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

Well, it changed a lot and the game got a lot bigger with a lot more to do.  The number of hours I have put into playing the game should say something about how much I enjoy playing it. Hours will slip by and I will wonder where the day went.\n\nAbout the game.\n\nYou have crashed on a planet and you must survive the night creatures. And only the creature types you have killed will hunt you at night. So start digging up necessary ore's or your going to die!\n\nThe water physics in the game were a challenge at first, but it really makes the game unique and fun. Use the water to your advantage with hydroelectric generators to power equipment. Craft solar cells to collect energy during the day. Create a base with turrets to protect yourself at night. Its all there, waiting for you to find it, to collect it, to bring it home and to build with it.\n\nYou must battle (at the moment, two) bosses in order to collect special items so you can build unique equipment to help you in your quest to escape the planet. The final mission is to build a rocket ship so you can finally leave this hostile planet.\n\nAll in all, I find the game adictive. If your not into 2D platform style games, then this may not be for you. But if you enjoy exploring, building and battling, and you can look beyond the game style, your going to love this game.","August 12, 2015","true","282.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","1"

It's well worth the low cost that's asked and the bonus of getting the final version for free is even better. Dig or Die has a great balance between grind/craft/build that doesn't become tedious like other games. Just when you think it will, you progress and unlock new things that change what you need to do. There's no going back and grinding out level 1 resources; you've always got enough just by playing and exploring. The progression feels natural, not laborious, and doesn't wear you down.\n\nBy far the best part of this game is the base defence. The combination of mining/crafting with tower-defence/building is amazing. Coupled with the under-spoken sci-fi theme it's a real joy to play. Highly recommended. Can't wait for the final version.","January 26","true","41.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

Though, I think Dig or Die isn't most fitting title for this game... Neverless....\nThis game is very well made for the start of early access.  Water, Water, Water.... every where.  Yes. There is tons of water but if your smart enough, you build your base on the highest part of the Mountain. If the monsters are too high of a level, build to the start of the area where the monsters are high level.\nSo it begins, for new players: Normal is more on 'learning the game mode of survival' and Hard is well... Hard.\n\nWhen I started this game, I did it on  Hard  and I suffered painfully. After 3 deaths from Hard difficulty night time, I decided it was best to start a normal game. I kept on forgetting to save the game, because if you don't save it... You have to start all over again if you die.  Water wasn't a problem for me on Normal [after 3 games], because I connected the water waste to the huge tunnels that goes wayyyyy below.  -The most important part of this game is:\n-180* turrets on top of the roof\nsome 180* turrets on the bottom with straight turrets going inward where the house is.\nThis way, none of the monsters can destroy your house.\nMake sure your house is off the ground by 4-5 blocks high so that the monsters can't jump up.\n-The other thing is, I strongly recommend having cement blocks and wood platform 1by1\nThis will help you shoot below, jump up to your house, filter the rain out of your house if it manage to get through, and let the excess Wasp monster to come through the bottom if the turrets can't kill them fast enough. Make sure you have a lot of health potions.\n\nOverall, I love the game for what it is right now. But you may be like-  "there some negative reviews!"\nThere is only one thing I got to say about that:\n"Wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Noah Ark Simulator. Wahhhhhhhhh."\n- Get over it. Build tunnels into caves. Build your house on the mountain. Be a man.\n\nGood Job for making this game. I'm glad that I bought tons of this game gifts now than later.","July 15, 2015","true","9.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","9","9","4","5"

(try to build a base, I dare you.)\n\nCons:  Upgrading tools-- You have to keep the one you upgrade in order craft certain items (it's basically teir specific), you can't just have one upgraded crafting thing, you have to have multiple if you want to backtrack.  It'd be more convenient in case you lose the smaller one. (Trust me, I've lost an upgrade before, it'd be pretty balls to lose the first one you get.), So much water. maybe a way to drain it or something?\n\nOverview:  Although I enjoy the game, it's best to grab it while it's still in development before the price goes up.  You probably won't regret it if you enjoy this type of game.\n\nIf you'd like to see a playthrough, check mine out if you want(first video is just me adjusting and checking out the works of the game).\nhttp://youtu.be/73VK1EAwS-U\n","March 9, 2015","true","4.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","1"

You are a galactic salesperson, selling automated fabrication tools. On a recent trip your ship crash lands on a strange planet, full of hostile creatures. You must put your fabrication tools to good use, and gather the local resources to build the structures and weapons needed to explore this new world and survive the nights.\n\nThe game kicks off with the protagonist outside their crashed ship, and leaves the player too start exploring and gathering resources. The crashed ship's AI offers some timely advice about some of the native creatures and some ideas on how to survive. Using your Miniaturizor you can mine the basic items of the world, and by killing different enemies collect valuable resources to build defences, and upgrade weapons and your autobuilder.\n\nI like this minimal instruction, as it is great fun getting in over your head in the early game. As you learn more about the world and find different resources, you will build stronger walls and the more powerful weapons and turrets needed to survive the onslaught of creatures each night. The night onslaughts are great fun, and have a tower defence feel.\n\nAs you progress the game starts to get a good rhythm , of exploring for new resources, then collecting all you can, before choosing a defensive location and digging in for the night. After surviving the night, I found it best to pack up my modest camp and move on in search of more resources. The resource gathering is well paced, and the requirement to upgrade your autobuilder repeatedly, to get to the best building materials, weapons and Miniaturizor is a great motivator to take risks when exploring.\n\nOverall, I was quickly drawn in and addicted to the rhythm and exploration in Dig or Die. I found the pacing to be spot on, with each day cycle giving you just enough time to increase your overall resource pool, before fighting out the night. The upgrade system with the autobuilder, dangles the carrot perfectly and had me searching every inch of this world for weird and wonderful resources. I can't wait to see what other craftable items become available throughout this games development, and recommend this game to anyone who enjoys sandbox creation and exploration.","March 11, 2015","true","2.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

At first I didn't expect much from a new Early Access game which only costed RM8 (Malaysian Ringgit), but I was BLOWN AWAY by the mechanics of Dig or Die !\n\nStory & ObjectiveYou crash landed on an unknown hostile planet because you're a horrible pilot, you had no choice but to survive horrible nights and collect materials to build another rocket to fly home.\n\nCombatsHardcore and fun. Combats are fast-paced so you had to have good aim of the enemy while running and jumping around the place to avoid enemy attacks.\n\nChallengesThere are many challenges I like about this game, one I came across is building a bridge to cross the huge gap to get precious materials. Building a bridge is not as easy as I thought it would be, the game has AMAZING physics implemented, the blocks break when it cannot support the amount of weight, falling to death several times is common.\n\nGraphicsWhen it first came out, the graphics weren't as good as the graphics it has now, the developer hired a professional artist through community voting for the best suitable new graphics for the game. Dig or Die has very colorful graphics, literally candy to the eyes.\n\nDeveloperThe developer is very active, and actually adds things to the game unlike most Early Access devs. He also responds to nearly every single thread in the forums and accepts ideas from the community.\n\nOverall Score\n9.367/10","May 20","true","25.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Then again, you can clear the "bridge" challenge by using the recoil from the shotgun.\n\nThe enemies are nicely varied if a bit overpowered by being able to dig and swim infinitely (even the flying ones). If there was an achievment for killing 6 enemies while airborn, I would have it, thanks to the shotgun.\n\nThe night combat gets inane and tedious once you've realised you can build a huge base in the minded out "crater" of a mountain.

The progression with the auto builders is superbly done, as that is pretty much spelled clearly out what needs to be done.  It might be a little difficult to find all of the items, but tha's where this game shines.

For $5, this game is a steal as it is. And where you pay $20 for a "promised" game, this concept of increasing pricing for "new" buyers based on added content is promising.

(At least on night one.)\nThere will be plenty of monsters on your ♥♥♥ and it will be DARK!\nIm talking about silhouette dark. So save at sunset.\nIf you don't have a save to load then you lose your world, simple as that.\nApparently if you don't bother or kill mobs they won't hurt you at night.\nThe problem is that they attack you during the day. Kinda making that a moot point.\nCrafting is easy to use. There's a bit too much of the whole "I need this item I don't know how to find to progress.\nThis game has awesome music. Calm for the midday labors and tense for the night fight or flight.\nI wish there were more though. There are no sounds for digging and collecting which is sad. As far as I know there is only one biome. The plains/hills. The game looks good in my opinion. I like the way it looks.\nThe combat feels weird and sorta stiff. I can't explain it but it isn't a snoothe as say, Spelunkey or Minecraft.\nAs for the mobs themselves they are aggravating at best. You have a flying creature a dog and a mole creature. And they are tiny!\nThey are hard to aim at. My biggest gripe is that their shots break blocks. NO! One mob is fine but ALL of them is a bad idea.\nThe biggest problem im currently having is the god damn flooding! It's happening all the time. At random! Anytime it rains your home is flooded. It seems as if there are no other weather effects so they put in rain to fill times where future planned weather\neffects would be. The options are limited at best. https://twitter.com/SnowWither/status/574784805264474112\nOverall a good title that should get better over time.

Other obstacles you will face are uppity regenerating pro-life fish, bending water (that is presumably being bribed by the fish to obstruct your quest), and floating cactuses that will fall out of the sky because they are depressed or their home sports team did not win the championship.\n\nBefore you can properly drown yourself, you will need to scrounge for materials and develop technology in order to build a basin large enough to hold the necessary water without exploding because gravity, and equip it with automated defenses to keep away both the fish and the mosquitoes, as well as put the water in its place, should it decide to tilt or twist in an unhelpful manner.\n\nFinally, you will need to build a rocket ship and program it to launch your carcass into space, because if you can't have a space funeral then what is the point?  Turning on the rocket will summon large quantities of protesting fish, mosquitoes, and angry water that your defenses will have to deal with on their own because at this point you will already be dead, so this requires some planning and engineering skills, and for me was one of the more enjoyable aspects of the game.\n\nThe rocket blueprint is questionable and probably was stolen from someone's 8th grade science project and sold on Craigslist, as the primary material needed to make it is the still-beating heart of an immortal space rock that floats in the atmosphere and probably was important to maintaining the planet's ecosystem, as killing it causes it to fall out of the sky, followed by a lot of rain, frogs, earthquakes, locusts, volcanic eruptions, plague, and a sudden disparity in the ratio of pro-life fish to their more aggressive eastern European cereal mascot shark counterparts, but what's important is that you get your awesome space funeral.

The water just flows so naturally coupled with a soothing background music it creates such an serene atmosphere. At times I just stood in my base, listened to nearby waterfalls and music.\n\nBut don't take this for a serenity simulator, it's far from that.

It's fun to build some emergency shelter with physics, it's fun to see the walls destroyed under enemy's attacks, it's fun to see the water flooding the place.\n\nAnd it's only 3€ for the release.","March 6, 2015","true","2.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Almost instantly, you are thrust into gameplay, with a little funny AI companion to guide you along your way. A few seconds in, and he tells you that you must look for supplies to make turrets before night comes, and you are forced to fight for your life. I got supplies and even got some wood with this cool little gizmo thing that's supposed to act as your 'mining' mechanic. It kind of reminds me of the gravity gun from the Half Life series, in it's look. I built a small fort with 2 sentries mounted on each side and hoped for the best went night came, and my god, was that one of the most epic fights I have ever had.\n\nWhile the music in the day time is peaceful and serene, when the monsters are unleashed after dawn, it turns into some epic, badass soundtrack that just made me feel awesome while I shot monsters left and right, determined to keep them away from my base, determined to keep myself safe.\n\nWhen night makes way to light, I have to work hard to find upgrades to my supplies, get better armor and better weapons as while you progress, the game gets increasingly difficult. But it all depends on how hard you chose your game to be in the settings. This is only the surface of the game, I've scratched, in almost just 1 hour of gameplay. The only issue I currently have with the game is that when the rain comes, it rains for only a few seconds, and it completely floods the land. Not a lot, but just enough to bug me and other players as it seems. I hope this gets fixed. Other than that, this game is completely worth it's price and people should get it.

If you aren't thinking about getting this game, get it anyway. This game combines traditional 2D sandbox mechanics with build-a-base mechanics. The concept is simple: Collect resources as best you can during the day, and fight off hordes of monsters during the night. However, this game makes you think. This game makes you consider every path, every defence, every resource, every kill, and every risk on every step of the way.\n\nAnother thing that separates it from the rest are the mechanics. What other game makes you consider  water pressure  in your defence strategy? Suffice it to say, you won't find any floating blocks in this game!\n\nNow of course, comes the cons. The complaints I have in this game are few. For one thing, it rains too much. You may complain about Minecraft rain being too loud, but in this game flooding is a serious problem. It can mess with your movement (which can easily kill you in more tense situations) and given enough time can break your structures. Another problem would be the building is a little... off. Just little things, like a block breaking when it shouldn't have or the support behaving unexpectedly, but they could still use some fine tuning.\n\nWhen it comes right down too it, that's all that's wrong with this game; it just needs some fine tuning. As a game that still in it's early stages, all it's problems should be taken with a grain of salt. From the time you're climbing the steep learning curve to when you've conquered its challenges, the game remains fun the whole time.\n\nOver all, a fun game with huge potential, and one I would happily pay three times as much for.","June 7, 2015","true","5.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

I like the day and night cycle and that it'll show how long you will have until day is over. I like how the mobs will only attack you at night if #1 you're close to them or #2 you attacked one of that particular species at some point already. I also like the different difficulty settings. You really don't see that often in most games where there will be 5 different difficulties with one being peaceful. I don't think I could handle anything over normal though, currently. One thing I would change if I could is not to have as many mobs starting out, because when I'm looking for a place to build after my first move I don't want to be running down too many mobs and end up getting swarmed by them all at night.

I haven't been playing terribly long at the point I'm writing this review, just about 4 hours.  The thing is, that's 4 hours in the same day... Which is huge for me with what is currently a single player game. So far, I have but one complaint, and that is: No co-op mode.  I have no idea if they plan to add one, and it's already loads of fun, but I'd absolutly love to play this with friends and familly. As the game is still in development, that could change.\n\nThat said: I like this game BETTER than Terraria, it just made more sense to me on an intuitive level. I've been learning very  quickly.\n\nYou set your own difficulty at the start, but also in the game as you progress. You do get mobbed at night, but only by the creatures you've killed before, so if you aren't in a really defensible location, just don't kill anything new.  The game makes it hard to get too far too fast. This is good, as the farther you are from the start, the harder the foe.\n\nSeriously, for a game this early in dev, at the price point its at...

Hardcore, permadeath, realistic survival.\n\nIt lets you go at your own pace, which by my standards is not the best feature, since a player can get stuck unintentionally from going out and getting new things. but for more casual players, this feature is totally fine.\n\nThe enemies are unique for each and every one of them, and the deeper you go, the more enemies you find. you also find more resources, to craft better gear, and to make better weapons. the movement is smooth, the controls spot on, and the combat fluid.\n\nIf you like survival 2d games like terraria, then try this game. If you like roguelike 2d games like risk of rain, than try this game out. it has random generation, expansive world, crafting, shooting, building, and REALISTIC WATER PHYSICS!!!!\n\nto be honest, this game is a gem that is worth way more than 5 bucks. I imagine that I could get at least 3 times the playtime that I already have on this game, just because it is so much addicting fun. multiple save files are nice too, meaning that you can have one world fully geared out and then start a new run on the hardest difficulty and see how far you get.\n\nBUY. THIS. GAME. Understand?\n\n\nAlso, the title should be dig and die, because most deaths come from underground. If you don't dig, you can sit in you perfect night survival setup like a little B*tch and live forever. But don't do that. That's stupid and uninteresting.

It easily combines Tower Defense elements with physics and a strong sense of survival. Graphics have some time getting used to, but blends together nicely. The only issues I found was the questionable save system and the structural physics. For someone who prefers casual games with a mix of hardcore elements, the structures in this game require knowledge of basic construction and more often than not hinders half of the creativity games like this want to become. If you don't know what I'm talking about, all of your buildings and creations must follow physical properties and be well supported, along with being not too heavy. I understand the appeal, but It doesnt suit a sandbox game in my opinion. Lastly the save system needs to be completely revamped. Currently your game auto-saves after every night but can be manually saved at any time. If your character dies, its gone forever until you reload a previous save. This means you lose everything you obtain between saves and amplifies the feeling of dread when a simple respawn system would fix this.\n\nI understand the game is not complete. If you enjoy a sanbox game with a slice of realism go for it. Until multiplayer is added, I do not see this game even coming close to the behemoths of Terraria and Starbound.

Overall gameplay needs several key issues addressed before I can wholeheartedly reccomend it to others. First, when the description said "open world"  I got excited thinking of a "runescape"  type of world.  What the dev mean by open world, is  that it is underground.  Now, this might seem obvious due to the title, but I was expecting more than just a handful of surface screens. Next, FALL DAMAGE must be addressed.  Several times I died simply because I fell into a ravine.  Now this is usually great.  I become careful around cliffs.  But when I cant activate my flashlight  (or any of my "devices")  it simply becomes annoying.  And finally, Crafting.  It seems by the amount of drops the enemies give, there should be more options per auto craft device.  So far I have been undewhelmed.  Also there needs to be a cheap way to stabilize concrete blocks in the game.  (scaffolding KINDA works, but not to it's real life potential)  The music can become repetetive.  Although not untill hour three (for me).  THIS IS VERY MUCH A WIP.  However, this game held my attention for three hours solid.  It's fun!  just needs more work.  All things considered, I give this game an 8/10 .  Fix some issues, and it'll be perfect.  Thanks Dev!\n\nan edit....

It reminds me very favorably of Terraria 1.0 but with its own unique twist. You start off marooned on an unfriendly planet after crashing your spaceship with nothing but an all-purpose mining tool and a crafting station. To survive you'll need to quickly gather all the materials to build a base capable of holding off the hordes of enemies that will swarm you at night. Gameplay is simple but functional; you mine and harvest materials and enemies to upgrade your Miniaturizer and Auto-Crafter so you can build bigger and better guns to kill bigger enemies with. Eventually you'll gain access to the materials needed to build a rocket and escape the planet.\n\nNow, after reading several reviews that warned of the game's difficulty, I decided to start my first game on normal, which turned out to be fairly easy. The fact that new, stronger enemies only attack at night once you've killed one of their type coupled with my tendency to overprepare meant that I never died at night and rarely died at all unless I overextended myself. My second playthrough was on brutal, which was an entirely different ballgame. The combination of increased enemy health and decreased player health meant that my first night was only beaten through luck and many reloads. It was still fairly easy once I farmed enough turrets, but there were some massive difficulty spikes on nights when I had killed a particularly tough enemy (like red or explosive fireflies) to upgrade my Miniaturizer but couldn't gather enough of the newly available resources to build stronger turrets.\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference between Dig or Die and other block simulators is the stress mechanic. Every block has two values; strength and weight. The strength of a block determines how much weight it can support. If the block's strength is exceeded, it breaks, usually causing a chain reaction that brings down the entire structure. This means players must focus a lot more on engineering than normal. Building up with a 1-block wide tower will only get you killed as the base collapses, while building a dam is much harder than simply placing dirt in the way. However, blocks placed on a background wall never break, so this mechanic is much less influential than it could be.\n\nDig or Die's power mechanic is also somewhat unique. Unlike redstone or Terrarian wiring, every circuit in Dig or Die requires an active power source to function. For most of the game, this means solar panels or hydroelectric power plants; no portable or storable power is available until the very end of the game. However, there are a full complement of logic gates, timers, and sensors available to use, so creating an energy-efficient teleporter or automatic airlock is not that difficult.\n\nOnce you beat the game, you gain access to the Epilogue, with an infinite Auto-Crafter and Jetpack. This is not creative mode; you do not have invulnerability and enemies will still try to kill you, but with infinite resources it is much easier to take on ambitious projects, like draining the underground ocean, plugging the Volcano or flooding the entire surface.\n\nOverall Dig or Die is extremely well-polished for an Early Access game and is well worth the asking price. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Minecraft, Terraria, or games like them.\n","May 28","true","137.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

One side note though, I would put in a few bosses that you have to beat to get parts to build the space ship, also, i would make the world bigger and make the rain not flood as much, but im sure you will make the right choice. But, over all, so far, i would rate this game probably around a 7.5 out of 10, and im sure it will go up when the game is fully released. btw, is it bad that i have had this game for around 2 or 3 days i think, and already have 10 hours put into it?","March 14, 2015","true","11.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I would definitely say it is well worth the price even now in this early stage. And as such i recommend it to anyone who has similar games and to those who don't. 7/10\n\nThe content already in this game is beyond acceptable for the price you pay for it. If the developer was to stop with this project tomorrow i wouldn't at all feel cheated out of my money. I have paid a lot more for a lot less.\n\nThe game it self is great. Its same says a lot for the game, you do need to dig or die. The night/day cycle is very well done, making night last a lot less time than day and also make the game very challenging at night.  Took me a couple of attempts to get into the style of play but got the hang of the basics now.\n\nThe game needs a tutorial of sorts to get you in the game maybe, as i feel the F1 help a little vague. The only other thing i don't like about the game is the character armour / clothing system. This and sometime the path finding on the enemies is a little less desired.\n\nOverall its a good game and a good price, i look forward to updates in the future.

Those 2 asap before adding more content.\n\nAlso, i miss a lot the possibility to use the dirt, rocks, etc you mine. All raw material, once obtained, cannot be used until converted to something. As this is a game where mobs are constantly shooting and breaking all materials and since you need also to dig and mine, this means that your base floor, favourite cave for spelunking and finally all your world, will be like a emmental cheese.\n\nAdding the huge quantity of rain and the fact that all that you build and all those holes i was talking about flood in a mere seconds, this means you will end diving across an emmental flooded world.\n\nDespite that, which i think is just a question of balancing water and filtrations, the game is very solid already. The movement is fluid and very well done and you can craft a good bunch of things: building materials, machinery, guns, armor, turrets for defense...\n\nI'm eager to see more, so i will update this first opinion after testing a bit more.\n\nOh, i forgot, and it's so cheap that will be almost a crime not to support the developer.\n\n2---Versión español:\n\nTodavía necesito probarlo más, pero por ahora el juego está muy chulo y muy bien afinado.\n\nEn mi opinión, necesita equilibrar algunas cosillas (la lluvia, filtraciones de agua, inundaciones...) y una opción para personalizar los botones. Ambas cosas lo más rápido posible, incluso antes de meter más contenido.\n\nTambién echo en falta la posibilidad de utilizar los bloques de tierra, rocas, etc que minas. No se puede usar ningún material en crudo si no se transforma primero en otra cosa. Como en este juego los enemigos están continuamente disparando y cargándose todo y como, obviamente, necesitas minar y cavar, esto significa que el suelo de tu base, tu cueva favorita para explorar y, en definitiva, todo tu mundo acabará pareciendo un queso emmental.\n\nSi añadimos la enorme cantidad de lluvia que cae y el hecho de que todo lo que edifiques y todos esos agujeros que mencionaba se inundan en apenas unos segundos, ello supone que acabarás buceando a través de un mundo como un queso emmental inundado.\n\nA pesar de ello, que creo que es tan sólo una cuestión de equilibrar el tema del agua y las filtraciones, el juego es muy sólido en el estado actual. El movimiento es fluído y muy bien ejecutado y puedes fabricar una buena cantidad de cosas: bloques para construcción, maquinaria, armas, armaduras, torretas para la defensa...\n\nEstoy ansioso por ver más, así que actualizaré esta primera opinión en cuanto lo pruebe un poco más.\n\nAh!, se me olvidaba, encima el juego es tan barato que sería casi un delito no apoyar al desarrollador.","March 5, 2015","true","3.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","6","9","4","0"

Although...\n_It's more action-y than Terraria: There's no slow start here, everthing is faster. You get to explore and do combat almost right away. You also dig and gather stuff a lot faster too.\n_Difficult: Surviving the first night might be way harder than you think. As enemies will relentlessly chase you down and ruin your entire life.\n_Exciting night time: During the night, the game plays like a tower defense, where the stuff that you painstakingly build in the daytime come under attack with waves of enemies. Set up those turrets!\n_Nice, clean presentation: Very quiet soundtrack. Simple in terms of graphics as well. But everything is easy to see and interpret, and never gets in the way of the gameplay.\n_It's 3 bucks: The game $3 right now. The creator mentioned that he doesn't want to sell this game at full price yet, until it's more fully featured.\n\nCons:\n_Still in Early Access: It's not fully featured. No crashes or game breaking bugs here, fortunately. But the game is still in the process of getting more content as we speak.\n_Could be too difficult at times: Or maybe I just suck. I don't really know.\n\nOverall, you would like this game if:\n_You like Terraria and looking for something different.\n_You DIDN'T like Terraria and looking for something different.\n_You like difficult games.\n_You like Tower Defense.\n_You like to kill wasps with laser guns. Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ those guys.\n\nIs it worth the (currently) $3 price? Absolutely, it's very easy to get into this game and lose track of time.

I don't usually play survival-type games, but this one hooked me. Stellar gameplay makes up for the moderately-good graphics. The day/night system reminds me a bit of Don't Starve in a good way. Still in Early Access, so glitches, bugs, and errors can be fixed, and improvements are sure to be made.

I say potential because although the framework for Dig or Die is solid and many updates are happening/coming, there are plenty of tweaks to be made to help with the overall enjoyment of the game. Most importatntly to me as a new player, would be to add an autosave function. The game DOES autosave every night, but the day/night cycles are long and no one wants to have to manually save, especially if they are reallly in the zone. The UI (user interface) and in-game menus are decent, but having an inventory screen where all my items are in a list feels very strange and akward. Finally, I know this might upset some people but, the RAIN is so annoying when attempting to build a house. I can put up with the physics building, but no one wants to live their entire early game in a f****** cave. I do not doubt that most players tried to build a typical survival house and watch it get flooded with water and fish to their disappointment. I understand how the game is supposed to be diffcult and rewarding, but the water is just frustraing and annoying, making the early game very not fun. Otherwise, it is a fun game and can't wait to play some more! With the game still in Early Access, I almost guarantee that the end result will be a polished and fun Indie game!","July 13, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The aspects of the game are very familiar to Terraria, but are also unique in their own accord. The really cool thing that caught my attention immediately is the creation and use of turrets, Which are incidentally, key to your survival in the game. I am going to list a couple pros and cons from my inital take of the game.\n\nPros:\n~Very unique gameplay style\n~Survival relies on more than just sitting and watching your turrets blast everything away.\n~Is very welcoming and has a very friendly appearance, despite its name.\n~Can be used as an entrance game to other more complex varieties, such as minecraft, terraria, Ect\n~Has extreme potential to be something amazing.\n\nCons:\n-Is heavily unfinished, (not particularly fair due to it being early access)\n-has a learning curve that is somewhat higher than most games of its type.\n-Can be quite difficult if you dont know what your doing.\n\nEdited: The game gets easier after many days have passed, finding out weapon upgrades and whatnot are essential, however aquiring these items to do so are often quite a challenge. @Gaddy Games, I would suggest making the world larger and making building things a little easier.

I don't usually play survival-type games, but this one hooked me. Stellar gameplay makes up for the moderately-good graphics. The day/night system reminds me a bit of Don't Starve in a good way. Still in Early Access, so glitches, bugs, and errors can be fixed, and improvements are sure to be made. The water simulation can be annoying, but I appreciate the consideration the developers put into this game, so as to make it this sophisticated. The monsters come in droves, forcing you to actually think about your fortifications and defenses. Physics in this game are pretty decent. All in all, for the price of $3, this game was too good to pass up! 12/10\n\nEDIT: AFTER V0.2 UPDATE:\nGraphics are even better than before, loads of things have been improved, more sophisticated systems and building/crafting physics.

Another similarity this game has with Risk of Rain is that the monsters you fight night after night are harder and stronger than in previous nights, so the purpose of mining is to get resources to build and upgrade your defenses. Your ultimate goal (which I have yet to achieve) is to get the necessary resources to build a spaceship and get off the planet.\n\nI have enjoyed the game so far, from what I have played. The controls take some getting used to and they are not the same as games like Terraria and Starbound, but if you have played those games at all, you should be able to pick up the controls pretty quick. It does take a bit of getting used to, and you may die before the first night is over on your first couple of tries, like I did. After you gather enough resources, you can build turrets and walls that will fortify your base.\n\n\n----Edit: the monsters don't get harder every night - until you explore more, and run into the harder monsters. Once you attack them, you'll see swarms of them come after you at night. Only attack them when you think you can handle them.\n\nHighly recommended! 10/10 (Especially for Terraria/Starbound/Risk of Rain players)","July 9, 2015","true","21.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","4"

During the day, you'll be able to go out, explore, collect resources, and so on.  During the night, you'll need to (quite literally) "Dig or Die"...that is, dig yourself a nice enclosure and hide behind your towers/base walls until morning.  The physics in this game are a bit more realistic too, what with the need to construct bridges in a "proper" manner lest gravity plunge them into the very pit you're trying to cross.  I personally find this game to be incredibly fun and is a must-own for those who enjoy "Terraria" and "Starbound".\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTykEFE6UaM","March 17, 2015","true","7.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Imagine something vaguely like Terria, but with a real sense of progression, physics, and purpose.  This game just does so much right.  Everything you do feels meaningful.   I built a base and spiked it with guns.  Why?  Because I freaking needed those guns to hold back the monsters at night or else they would destroy my base and overrun me.  I set up a semi-elaborate system of water power.  Why?  I needed to set it up so that I could use a teleporter between two areas of operation.  I built a bridge and later on a couple of towers; both of which were kind of challenging because physics actually matters a little.  I built those things for a purpose; I need to span a chasm and to get to something high.  Build your tower or bridge without enough support and it WILL fall down.  If you don’t stud them with turrets, monsters will eventually rip them down.\n\nThis game (at least right now while in Early Access) isn’t a hundreds of hours of sandbox time game.  You can play it like a sandbox, but you can also win.  I just beat it after roughly 40 hours, and I feel like I spent the right amount of time doing it.  I am satisfied and done.  If this game gets released with more content after early access, I’ll probably be back to do it again.  If it doesn’t, I’ll still be contended with what a got.  If it didn’t say Early Access, I would have never of guessed because it is pretty damn complete as it is.\n\nThe only real possible negative I could see someone having with this game is that it is smaller in terms of scope and sprawling then Terria and other Terria-alike games.  It doesn’t have a dozens of biomes or hundreds of enemies.  It is smaller, but I actually kind of find this to be a positive because it is so much tighter than other Terria-alike games.  It is like the developer picked a proper amount that they could bit off and made it exactly that big.\n\nOverall, if you like Terria flavored games, this is easily one of the best right now.  If the developer adds more between now and release, that is all just gravy to me.  Seriously, congratulations to whoever developed this; this game is just great.","October 10, 2015","true","34.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

This isnt Terraria and doesnt have 10,000 items/equipables to craft, the crafting is very limited, and all items are unlockable in a very linear fashion. There are few enemies, most of which are clones of earlier variations. and are not very interesting to fight. The building physics seem pretty wonky and don't work exactly how you'd expect (then again I am a carpenter by trade so i am biased XD)\n\nAs a side note the wiki is a mess and found myself stumped a few times on how to progress.\n\nIn its current form for the price I'll give it a 7/10 and would recommend if you want to kill a few hours.","October 31, 2015","true","15.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","5"

It's great to see a game where something as simple as rainfall can cause such huge problems.  Happily spent a couple of hours on peaceful just playing round with the water.\n\nWhich leads me to my OHGOD moment...  There's a big dude down there somewhere whom, when you approach, apparently throws the peaceful setting out the window.  And the autosave just before you meet him (an awesome idea, I can see that being a lifesaver!) seems to have saved AFTER everything I'd been walking past suddenly decided I WAS tasty after all.  I'll never see my dam again, nor break the seal to drain my giant artificial lake into the giant natural lake.\n\nBeyond that, the progression is neat, and having to bridge the chasm to get to the next 'tech level' was nice...  the second time...  the first time involved questionable 'knowledge' of architecture and a quick lesson in gravitational forces; somewhat similar to learning why you don't stand ON the branch you're sawing off a tree...  :P  I didn't get too far into my non-peaceful try, something to do with enemies who will tunnel to you if you block them off.

I understand that uranium is really rare, but I have searched my whole world and do not have enough uranium to build my rocket ship.

Game can really push you to do things quickly and those who want some hardcore crafting\survival action should look into it.\n\nI see good things for the title if they keep building on it. For now, i'll stick to other crafting games.\n\nNote: The rain effects in this game are awesome. :)","August 31, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

This game has become incredibly fun. I would highly recommend a playthrough. It'll take you a couple tries to get the hang of it, but it is well worth the time. This is definitely a game to own and stay up to date with. The Dev is constantly involved with the player community and responds kindly and with tons of info if you are stuck or upset. Give this one a try. I got fed up at the beginning of Early Access, but the updates to this game make it worth playing.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Previous Review) - Thumbs Down\n\nI'm playing on normal and can't even make it to the 3rd day. The game difficulty increases near-exponentially while your ability to upgrade is tediously slow. The acqisition of materials needed for crafting is difficult and delayed but extremely necessary to make it through even a single night.  The water is just a pain in the rear. I know it is being billed as one of the key features, but I hate it. Water accumulates even where there was no water and no way for it to get where you are. Diggin in a dry patch of dirt uphill? Lets fill it with water.  Not raining above ground? Lets make it rain underground. Can't mine through stone yet? Don't worry, the first-level enemies can blast right through it.\n\nI typically hold off on giving a review like this, but this game needs a lot of work before I would suggest buying it.\n\nCheck back in a few months and see if there are any updates before buying. The developer is claiming to be done, if all goes well, by summer 2015? Hell no. This game is not even close to being done.\n\n---------------------------EDIT --------------------\n\nClose to making me change my recommendation.\n\nSo I have been back to check in on the game and here is what I've found:\n\nVery big thumbs up for the Dev taking part in community reviews and being nicer than a grandmother with dementia. Seriously, the Dev actually seems to care if people enjoy the game. Its a nice change of pace for early access. Well played Dev!\n\nThe "tutorial" given by your ship seems a bit more informative. It tells you how to get along a bit better than when I first played. If you play on easy, you can survive, but it is almost too easy. I like a challenge, but the content is still a bit lacking. I like the concept of the game and enjoyed the play through on easy.\n\nVerdict: so-so.\n\nEasy is now too easy and difficult is really bloody difficult. The plus side of this is that you can play on easy to get the hang of things and try your hand at difficulty settings afterwards. The updates of the game have definitely helped. My hope would be to see a "DLC" for this game to extend the game play and allow for a bit slower increase in difficulty on normal difficulty settings.\n\nAlso, good luck if you get a map with sky islands that are 40+ blocks above you... That took some creativity on my part.","March 18, 2015","true","41.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Elliotcop/recommended/315460/","Elliotcop","-[EVIL]-Elliotcop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Elliotcop/","45 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The game is in early alpha so anything i say about the game (negative and positive) is for the game in its current state, My opinion in the future is definetly going to change after some time, and the way this game is going, its going to be a VERY, VERY good opinion.\n====================================================================================\n\nI like the idea, but i dont think its that original, (Build a base and survive the night!) Which doesnt make it bad! its just not that 'new'.\n\nINTRO\n=====\nDig or Die is a 2D Sandbox, action, adventure, strategy game. (thats a mouthful)\nYour ship has crashed on an alien planet, You must use the supplies on the ship to gather recources and build a base, Then continue to build better weaponry and tools to survive the onslaught of aliens that come at night.\nExplore caves and floating islands and find new aliens that are stronger and faster and will probably own you when you fist see them.\nWill you be able to survive and leave the planet?\nyour only option is to Dig or Die.\n\nGAMEPLAY/PROBLEMS\n================\nThe gameplay is very fun and is worth the money. Building a badass base and big guns to kill aliens with? AWSOME\n\n(the following paragraph is just suggestions, im not hating on the game :D)\nI dont have that much time in the game but i already know what you do in the game.\nget the tier 1 crafting thing-->upgrade your weapons, structures and tools--> get tier 2 crafting thing--> upgrade your weapons structures and tools--> get tier 3 crafting thing and so on.\n\nI feel this needs to be improved on quickly to stop it being repetitive and boring. Maybe only have one crafting thing and hide the higher tier recipies untill you find a blueprint for the item (maybe have chests or something that holds items that will help you like blueprints, its just a suggestion) or until you get some of the materials for it.\n\nCOMBAT\n======\n\nThe combat is very fast paced and intense which i like a lot, but i feel that there needs to be a way to instantly switch to your weapon, i lost a lot of health when trying to scroll to my weapon when i was building.\n\nBUILDING/PHYSICS\n=============\n\nThe building is simple and easy to understand. Which is good, it doesnt need to be complicated.\nThe physics and the flooding was a great thing to add in, it adds a much needed challenge to the game and overall makes it even more fun to play.\n\nAgain with the tier system in the game right now (T1 crafting--> T2 crafting...) i find myself not really building my base out of the building blocks that the crafting things allows us to make (wood --> stone ---> ect) because i know that i will just destroy it all to replace it with the better, higher tier blocks. (READ MY GAMEPLAY PARAGRAPH FOR MY SUGGESTION ON HOW TO FIX THIS)\n\nBUGS\n====\nI have seen Hardly Any bugs which is rare for an Early alpha game, he only thing that ive seen (i dont know if its a bug or not) is that you can shoot through one-block thick walls. which makes it easy to survive the night.\n\nOVERALL\n=======\nThe game is very fun but very repetitve, I think it is worth the money and you will get a lot of gameplay from it.\nI think this game is a time burner, you got some spare hours and dont know what to do? just play this! time seems to go by quick when trying to kill hordes of aliens and building huge towers and underground bases.\n\nDont forget, this game is in early alpha, There will be bugs, there will be things you dont like, but when they release the full game, ITS GONNA BE AWSOME!!!! MULTIPLAYER, BOSSES, MORE PLACES TO EXPLORE AND MORE WEAPONS AND TURRETS AND OMMGGGGGGGGGGGG....\nplus if you buy the game in early alpha your getting it cheaper than the full game when its released\n(it will be $12 on release..Ooooh i got it cheaper....will you?)\n\nOverall 6/10 (untill the next major update :D)\n\nMESSAGE TO THE DEVS:\n=================\nIf you read this please reply, and tell me what you think about my suggestions, i plan to follow this game till there are no more updates. THANKS\n\n\n\n","June 27, 2015","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","5"

The game is very easy to get a handle on, yet it is very difficult.  You'll find your first night way harder than you thought it was going to be (if you kill something on your first day) with bees trying to gun you down and dogs rushing and destroying your base.  The difficulty makes the game more fun however and allows focus on uprgrading your base and tools.  This is NOT a Minecraft clone (thank god) and is one of a kind.  It focuses rather on an objective and defense, rather than worrying about hunger and how stylish your home is.  You wont be crafting pioneer tools such as pickaxes, axes, swords, etc., but rather laser guns, a tool that extracts resources by rays, and other unique, futuristic items.  I am really excited to see where this game goes and what type of stuff they will add in that will keep the survival-defensive like feel while keeping things fresh and new.

For example, enemies digging strait to you at night from the surface. I abandoned my surface base to make a deep underground one and well... no they were coming from the caverns. Eventually I made a near surface base and found a way to prevent this from happening. I wont spoil it, find out how to yourself.\n\nWater is a force your going to have to deal with. Occasionally when building down you need run off areas (Massive hole near by) Or spare water tanks incase the area gets flooded. Dirt also holds water, and if enough is removed you can quickly find an area flooded. Rain also seeps through dirt, flooding anything down below, however this is easily blocked.\n\nI'm awaiting for more updates, I beleive this game is going to be a blast full release.

This isnt Terraria and doesnt have 10,000 items/equipables to craft, the crafting is very limited, and all items are unlockable in a very linear fashion. There are few enemies, most of which are clones of earlier variations. and are not very interesting to fight. The building physics seem pretty wonky and don't work exactly how you'd expect (then again I am a carpenter by trade so i am biased XD)\n\nAs a side note the wiki is a mess and found myself stumped a few times on how to progress.\n\nIn its current form for the price I'll give it a 7/10 and would recommend if you want to kill a few hours.","October 31, 2015","true","15.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","5"

I recommend it for any sandbox fans for many reasons. 1 the physics adds new challenges and forces you to think out your builds. 2 the monsters are amazing, have great AIs and they also can break blocks. One thing that I would definetly change is the amount of uranium and sky islands. I understand that uranium is really rare, but I have searched my whole world and do not have enough uranium to build my rocket ship. Also it is really difficult to find sky islnads, and I constantly find myself haveing to go cave diving more to get the materials to build another tower just to get to the firefly boss. Overall though tis game has amazing gameplay and you should buy it now before it has a full release and has it's price raise.

Your character is 1x1 blocks in size, making traversing underground much faster. You only have/need one resource harvesting tool, which you can use regardless of what you have equipped with the right mouse button. The escalation in what can make and what enemies you have to worry about is well done. The building physics and nightly enemy swarms will keep you engaged in building/improving your base.

I can see myself playing this all the time in the future if the devs keep up the good work. I like to build forts, like in minecraft or terraria, but when i am done not enough mobs come to breach my wimpy outer defense, so it feels like i spent so much time on nothing. This game gives a reward for that time, an awesome affective base. if i was the devs this would already be 20$ so buy while its still low! I also feel like the devs know what there doing, as there are no bugs i have found yet.\n\nok, this game has a need for content, but other than that its totally worth it. i also want there to be minibosses that come out once or twice every night.

I'm not entirely sure what additional development is supposed to be added to this game but "as is" the game is worth the cost by a long shot.\n\nIf you've played Terreria or Starbound then you'll feel right at home playing this game. The major difference at this point between Dig or Die and those games is both difficulty and depth. Dig or Die is far less deep and much less difficult at all stages of the game. While I've yet to beat Dig or Die I've played 7 hours and nearly completed what I percieve to be the end of the game. I'd venture to say I'd need 3-4 more hours to complete it at most.\n\nI've played more than 50 hrs in Terreria and Starbound each and I've not come close to completing those games.\n\nDig or Die stands on its own in my mind. Beyond look and feel Dig or Die is a different game than Terreria or Starbound.\n\nDig or Die doesn't require the same level of non-stop grinding that the other two games do. The learning curve is significantly lower and the strategy required to succeed only needs average execution for survival/progression.\n\nPros:\n-Only $5\n-More of a Causal Play (easy to pick up)\n-Low Learning Curve\n-Relatively short Start to End\n-No excessive grinding\n-Graphics 8/10 (for this genre)\n-Mechanics are smooth\n-Fun 8/10\n\nCons:\n-A bit too shallow (I realize its early release)\n-Can feel a bit repetitive between tiers\n-Game allows player to get too OP by mid-late game\n-Very little consequence for dying\n\nAll in all I'd say spend the $5, playthrough in about 10-20 hours (depends on skill), and then see what new things the developer adds.","January 10","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It runs very well, no problems. Playing for the time that I did, I couldn't actually find a single bug, which is doubly suprising for, again, the very early state that it is in. The only problems that I have with this game are that the water never really seems to dissipate, and just keeps building up in underground caverns. Also, the building support system can be a bit wonky at times.\n\nOther than those minor gripes, the game is just incredibly fun to play.

When i first loaded in i had my doubts, but this game has Potential. The idea of mobs coming to attack your base at night is scary for a few night, but after building your base you feel more prepared. Most of the Negitive reviews i saw were about how there is so much water, and yes i agree it dose get a little overbord some times, its a fun aspect of designing your base and making a drain system. Also another thing people complained about was the fact that theres only Three teirs of upgrades and that the game "was not ready." to that i say isnt that what the point of early accsess, to give your opinons on a game in development and so the dev's can change things for the better of the game?\n\nSo if you're looking for a 2-D adventure, Tower defence, Sandbox that will only get better over the corse of development. i HIGHLY recomend this game. Its 3 Bucks (at the time of writing this review) So what could go wrong?\n","July 14, 2015","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Wood at this current state is quite useless , I find no use for it , and I find that rather bad.\n+I hope for some NPC enemys to fight with / team up with (?). Also, monsters are destroying my base way too fast, so I would reccomend buffing the walls and turrets, since they get destroyed almost on an instant.\n+Improve graphics ?

There's a big dude down there somewhere whom, when you approach, apparently throws the peaceful setting out the window.

Your character is 1x1 blocks in size, making traversing underground much faster. You only have/need one resource harvesting tool, which you can use regardless of what you have equipped with the right mouse button. The escalation in what can make and what enemies you have to worry about is well done. The building physics and nightly enemy swarms will keep you engaged in building/improving your base.

Don't let the cute aestethic fool you, this is a challenging game.  What makes it different:  Water mechanic/physics - They are still balancing this, but I'm enjoying the additional challenge it poses.  Building physics, tension and sheer force.  Plan your buildings, bridges and towers to get placse otherwise you'll be sorry when they collapse.  And at night it's defense, as any mob you attack during the day will attack at night.  Build a base and lots of turrets and hunker down.\n\nThe alpha branch is also available to play if you prefer bugs, but I have yet to run into any in the beta branch or alpha branch.","January 9","true","31.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With a beautiful art stlye, and gorgeous soundtracks, I always find myself logging back into Steam just to play this game. I would highly recommend Dig or Die to those who are familiar with "Spluenky" and "Supermeat Boy", especially if you adore fast paced immersive gameplay, or if you're just simply looking for a time consumer.\nThere's not much else I can say about the game other than I just love it. But don't take my word, install the game and you'll see yourself slowly becoming more and more addictive to it.\nA solid 9.5/10 (Not 10/10 only because the game seems to lack content, however, the Devs are updating this game frequently with new content - to which then this would be a perfect 10/10).","April 16","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is similar to games such as Terraria, but is much faster paced and puts an emphasis on combat (which is a great thing by the way). For an early access game, this sure does feel like a full and complete game. If you are remotely interested in this game I suggest that you pick it up and try it out ASAP. And if you are still on the fence, look up some play-throughs and you'll get the basic idea of this game after seeing a full day and night cycle. So if anyone here is interested in survival games such as Terraria or Starbound I suggest you pick this up. And even if you're somewhat new to this genre (as I was), you might just be pleasantly surprised. Even if you get this game later after it is early access, I think that this game will still be worth it.","April 13, 2015","true","52.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Your progression is based on your thirst for exploration. The way this game has you build bases is intuitive and very open-ended.\n\nThe story present in the game is fun and doesn't take itself too seriously, but still manages to deliver. Music is enjoyable, but some enemy sound effects do get tiring. The days sometimes feel very short, but I felt that it (fairly) added to the challenge. Replayability is high, and also works nicely to support multiple playthroughs at once.\n\nThis game is worth the price tag, exceeding it by far.

It looked fun, and the fact that it was so inexpensive also helped me along. For me, the fact that it is currently in early-access means I get to actually have a game from its release, and watch it grow and evolve. The game itself is one I enjoy. A lot. It is reminescent of Terraria, but it has a stronger grasp on physics. I discovered that to build a bridge across a certain chasm, I needed to have a huge support for one half, then I had to use the shotgun's recoil to jump to a small ledge on the other side, and build another oversized concrete arch. I managed to connect the two, and it didn't fall!\nThe guns have recoil in the game, with the shotgun having the most as far as I have experienced. You can aim in the opposite direction of where you are going and pull the trigger, preferably while jumping, and you'll propel yourself across the terrain with ease. It reminds me of rocket jumping in TF2.\nNow, onto the enemies: they start out nice and easy, just your basic horn hounds and whatever the bee thingies are in the beginning. The bees are ranged, but the power crystals they drop are essential. You are able to craft some turrets early on, and you WILL need them when night comes. Luckily, night is rather short, but very intense. I have survived maybe seven or eight nights, and have lost an unfortunate amount of my turrets. This is due to the black variant of the bees having a long burst of stinger-plasma-bolt-thingies, each dealing 6 damage with-out armor. They melt terrain, and your defenses along with it.\nIt all creates a unique and difficult challenge, which I quite enjoy. The music is... Incredible, to say the least, and the gameplay is addicting. I don't really know what I could recommend to be added, because I just have no idea WHAT to add. I'm a player, not a programmer. (No, not THAT kind.) So, all in all, this game has my attention, and it will keep my attention. I am eager to see how it all unfolds.","April 11, 2015","true","43.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

That generally means they have to be off your screen, but quite a few early enemies are faster than you.\n-Because of how the physics work, it has been nearly impossible for me to build a successful bridge, even when I know I'm doing it correctly. I have fallen to the depths of the world 3 times now, and I've barely been playing for an hour.\n\nOverall, it is an OK game, one that I do recommend, but expect a lot of somewhat unnecessary challenge (for reference to the difficulty, I've only been playing on the second-easiest difficulty so far.)","August 18, 2015","true","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've been playing it off and on, a little here and there since it first came out on Steam. The developer is very friendly and interacts with the community a lot, often fixing bugs ASAP when he sees a bug report. It gets new features added all the time.\n\nTo be clea, this is a survival game. This is not building cute structures or making emoji faces with lego blocks. You have to survive nightly onslaughts from creatures you killed throughout the game. The more creatures you kill, the more that show up. It's pretty entertaining, and I'd say well worth $10, let alone a mere $5 or even a good steam sale. If you like playing building games and you'd like to try a fun terraria-esque survival game, buy it!\n\n8/10.","October 16, 2015","true","10.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Recommended.\n\nPlus:\n- Actual objectives, that make exploring mandatory\n- Sci-fi environment\n- Very fast digging speed\n- More realistic building and structures (building a larger bridge or tower is an actual challenge)\n- At night monsters come, changing the pace of the game\n- Endless inventory\n\nSo-so:\n- Monsters can dig, so you can't build unpenetratable defences.\n- The water behaves more realistical.  I think it doesn't change a lot of things after all, just mentioned since it is different here.\n\nMinus:\n- not a lot of items to create\n- not a lot of variety in enemies\n- no summonables (or at least I didn't found any).

No, but seriously. If you like Terraria-esque games and you like a challenge, this is the game for you. It has a ton of content and, in my opinion, has smooth and polished game mechanics that'll prove to be a nuisance (in a good way) for your bases and an advantage for the monsters trying to eat you alive. Sometimes, you'll have to rush to get a new weapon before the day is over, because that's when the baddies come. Other days, you'll be mining around for minerals to create turrets, probably the only things that'll protect and fight for you. Oh, and dont forget about the save mechanic. Once you die in the game, you have to load from the most recent save; whether thats 3 seconds ago or 3 days ago, it's up to you to save the game if you want to "save" yourself. All in all, this is a very fun game, one that I would definitely recommend to anyone who has read this far. Be cautious about what difficulty you pick though...

Or noah's ark 2.  There is water everywhere, and it gets a little insane.  At this point in time, I would say this isn't such a great game, and that I wouldn't recommend it until it comes off early access.\n\nThe good parts of this game is the music for sure!  It's very upbeat during nighttime.  It sets a good atmosphere, and it works pretty well with the game.  I love the backgrounds above ground, and I honestly like the building physics.  It makes sense and is fun to try and build something nice while avoiding it collapsing.\n\nThe bad parts of the game, as I mentioned before, is the water.  Mind you, I love rain in video games, but I started to dread it when a storm came in.  It is almost impossible to get out of a cave after it rains because the current is so strong, and If you build your house wrong, it floods.  I feel like I had to maintain the landscape and caves of the game, to allow it to drain properly.  I really like the idea that the world was flooding, but the water needed to drain faster, and the current is just too strong.\n\nAnother annoying thing about the game was the movement.  I could be walking on flat ground and it would seem like I was being jerked around in the other direction.  He would almost stutter back and forth as he walked.  Same for the mobs.  The character's jumping is also really strange, because it seems like he jumps differently every time.  Sometimes he'll jump really short, and other times he'll jump his normal height.  It makes it really hard to get around the terrain that way.  I really like the shotgun, and I love that there is knock back from the weapon, but it can get a little too out of hand. A couple of shots and I'm either a third across the map, or I'm careening down the cave shaft.\n\nThe crafting could use more explanation.  I have a lot of ingredients, like grass, but don't know what to do with it all.  Could use a chest or something to keep all the junk until you upgrade crafting stations.  Also the underground is a bit boring.  The graphics are very simple, but it just needs something to break up the really mundane rock and dirt.\n\nNot bad for so inexpensive, but it definitely needs some work.  I'll be interested to see how it updates.","May 21, 2015","false","2.3"," 59 of 117 people (50%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","50","59","117","13","7"

Get it if your into Terraria.\nYou start out with a basic gun and a Deatomizer and a MK1 Auto-Builder, but as you progress, you get the MK2, MK3, and the MK4. You get turrets and better guns, better building blocks, harder monsters to fight, armor, and health regen potions. Going to try not to spoil the guns or turrets or anything past MK1 for you.\nWith the MK1, you can get a shotgun, or get a turret that can go on walls and has a 180 degrees view field. You build some basic blocks out of wood, and start working up to the MK2. Now, there are some minor bugs or glitches here and there..\nLike, well, why does your inventory tell you have 0 of something when you run out, and keeps it in your hotbar? It is a little bit annoying when my hotbar gets filled up by nonexistent items... and then you have those dogs or wolves or the (spoiler) dwellers that jump and can hit you thru one block spaces. I have died tons of times because of me being on low health, and then a wolf is like, "Na bruh you gonna die" (mario jump) boop hit through the floor. Then there is a sort of useful glitch where you can completely pause the game, press f2, (opening your inventory) and click something in your inventory or I think dragging it to your hotbar. *cough* health pots.. *cough*\nNow, that can be extremely useful is clutch situations when you are gonna die, press esc, press f2, and then heal yourself. All better.\nOne thing you must do developers.

I love the cocept, story (because i like alien stuff so im a littele bias) but it could use improvements. For ex,  I  cannot build sideways to build a bridge. I understand why its like this, but as time goes on you can get bored of it qiuckley. I also would LOVE it if you could build like, a robot. Like, it would patroll an area within a certain amount of blocks, or if you could get a pet like in terraria. I understand it is hard to make a game, but this gets old fast. It does have replayability, but could definantly use some improvements. I also wish doors where a thing, like they would block some water or at least delay it before it floods the location. It is worth buying at its current state, but I want it to have a buldable community like terraria, wich is what i loved most about the game.

No bugs so far, dev promises an end game but I have'nt played long enough to achieve this. It is pretty difficult, but you can save anytime.

The biggest innovation with this versus anyother sidescroller exploration is the realistic water. Its a very wet planet and when it rains the water level rises, then seeps away.

It's alot like Craft the World where you craft things you need from resources you find in the surrounding environment. It is in early development, that being said it is good for the stage that it is in. The User interface is not very fluid at the moment of this review. It hard to deterrmine what you have and what builds what and where to find what you need. It's not easy to figure out what everything is and what makes what and building a base is confusing at the moment. I built a couple of turrets to guard from the monsters at night and explored quite a bit, playing it on normal. I played for around 30 minutes before I got a tad frustrated in what exactly I needed to do to start building my base and wall placement for it is sorta confusing and I did not see a door i could place amongst my walls to build my base. Terraforming is kinda hard to do and clunky atm. I see much potential though and will keep an eye on this title from time to time to see if it gets better. For now I will give the game a 6/10 because it is cheap and it is fun if you want to muddle through for a few hours dying over and over again and trying to get the materials you need to build things you need etc.\n\nOn a side note to all developers that use the word share in their reason for having a early release, if you are charging money for the game you are "sharing" then I think the proper word is SELL the game not share it.","September 30, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's alot like Craft the World where you craft things you need from resources you find in the surrounding environment. It is in early development, that being said it is good for the stage that it is in. The User interface is not very fluid at the moment of this review. It hard to deterrmine what you have and what builds what and where to find what you need. It's not easy to figure out what everything is and what makes what and building a base is confusing at the moment. I built a couple of turrets to guard from the monsters at night and explored quite a bit, playing it on normal. I played for around 30 minutes before I got a tad frustrated in what exactly I needed to do to start building my base and wall placement for it is sorta confusing and I did not see a door i could place amongst my walls to build my base. Terraforming is kinda hard to do and clunky atm. I see much potential though and will keep an eye on this title from time to time to see if it gets better. For now I will give the game a 6/10 because it is cheap and it is fun if you want to muddle through for a few hours dying over and over again and trying to get the materials you need to build things you need etc.\n\nOn a side note to all developers that use the word share in their reason for having a early release, if you are charging money for the game you are "sharing" then I think the proper word is SELL the game not share it.","September 30, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

At the beginning it's pretty easy, but then it gets more difficult. It's kind of like Terraria with a mix of Sci-Fi, to the point where you end up with hundreds of turrets, guns and enemies. I suggest beginners start with easy difficulty, instead of normal or hard, as without enough experience it's almost impossible to live on normal difficulty...

The amount of items you can craft is fairly decent, personally I can't complain. Though, I would very much like to see more items in the future.\n\nCombat is typical platform-style game, but the fact that you can make better weapons adds up. What I disliked the most was the amount of monsters that spawn at night. It's nearly impossible to be safe, even in a concrete building. I found out that digging down to stay out of sight from the monsters worked best. Don't even consider building a house unless you figure something out.\nNOTE: You can't build doors as far as I'm concerned. I'm not sure if you can with the tier 3 crafting system.\n\nI like the physics, all though the rain/water can be a little annoying at some points.\n\nConclusion: I would like more content. Somewhat reduced monsters at night (or content such as traps, guards, more turrets, better building material etc.)\n\nOverall it's a great game with potential for the price. If I were to compare this to anything, I'd probably say Starbound or Terraria.","May 24, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Only but a quick glance at the discussion boards shows the developer is involved with the community, is open and willing to consider suggestions or feedback, and wants players to have the most fun out of the loose change spent on this fantastic product.\n\nSo if you have a few spare bucks - pick up this game.

They destroyed my house and I died. I made a bunker, surrounded by 2 meters concrete on each side. It rained and the bunker was flooded, I had to leave and I died. Then I made a bunker with a sewer system. Turns out they were still around even by daylight. I had to choose between dying or clinging to every second of life while they restlessly bashed on the concrete. I died. But then I made a fort with tall walls, a tight sewer and a ton of mounted guns. The night was fierce with fighting and they managed to take down one of my walls, but it lasted just enough to bring me the joy of seeing another day. They say there's plants that will help me get technology for better building materials to the west. I couldn't manage to build an entire bridge across the chasm because the materials were so close to giving, but I think with the right push I might make it across in a jump, taking a one way trip, at least for now, to never before explored lands. Maybe with that technology I'll be able to reach the floating islands that seem so much safer, and finally sleep well.

Just, it looks like it was made in flash. There's some decent pros and cons that I'll get into later. So, in short: Why do I recommend it? Because it's $2.99. and it's not too hard to get more value out of this than your local fast food dollar menu. There's mandatory gap(s) to build over, so it forces you to use the bridge system. Toped with structural integrity of some sort, you may have zero luck doing whatever. It's a fairly quick play. If I had to guess, you could speed run this in about an hour from begiunning to end. But that may not be giving the game enough credit, due to some of the (current) end game collection needs.\n\nThe long version:\n\nWithout comparing it to obvious titles, this is your standard 2d sidescrollking sanbox adventure game. You're bound within a certain width of the map, and you spawn in the middle of it. You're given a basic box (it does all your crafting, because lore) with some basic recipes in it. You do the standard 'break and kill things for loot' and use it to make a larger, more advanced box to craft upgrades for your collection tools, guns, make new blocks etc.\n\nPros:\n\nClean graphics - Simple yet charming graphics make it easy to comprehend the background from foreground.\nPhysics - The blocks you place have physics, and will deconstruct themselves if you don't have any structural integrity.\nWater - There's lots of it. Always. The water physics are quite good. Gravity affected, and follow semi-normal laws.\nCheap - It's stupid cheap, better than a dollar menu!\n\nCons:\n\nThe graphics look like they were made in flash. Charming as they may be, it looks like a title from newgrounds from the early 2000's.\nToo much water. There's always water, and it doesn't go away, it just falls through caves and fills up somewhere.\nEarly access- This is ONLY a con, due to the lack of content. But for the price, I suggest you get over it. Its your money, don't buy if you don't want to.\n\nDo I recommend? Sure, why not.

It's not bad, and I really love the basic story about crashlanding on a planet and trying to escape it by ultimately building a new space craft. What I don't like is that the game is not very good at following through on that story. The worst are the creatures. They are highly unoriginal, and the AI is just plain dull. I would expect to find aliens, from weird little blobs (they even have those in Terraria) to dino-inspired terrifying bone♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Instead I get... yes, it's true: bees, bats and dogs! And what is it about creatures from all biotopes suddenly narrowing down on you at night (after you attacked them just once)? No matter if you're deep, deep underground or high, high up on a mountain, they all gather just outside the screen boundary to start their relentless onslaught. The fact that even the aforementioned bees, bats and dogs can easily tear down your hard-earned reinforced steel blocks, is just another example of how this games needs more consistency to be taken seriously. It's a treat to build a secure base. It's just so much more annoying to see it fall apart every night.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emailboxu/recommended/315460/","emailboxu","Boxtacular","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emailboxu/","185 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIt's like a single player Terarria that focuses on you fighting off monsters during night time. Unlike Terraria, however, the visuals are fairly weak, the gameplay feels awkward because of the odd physics in the game (why does a plasma rifle knock you back...?), and overall it's not very.. fun. Terraria and other Minecraft spinoffs work because of the multiplayer aspect, or because they make the objective of the game very different from the originals; Dig or Die does neither.\n\nPros:\n\n- Game progression is much faster than other similar games (Single player vs Multi, I guess)\n- Basically no learning curve\n\nCons:\n\n- The actual gameplay is really boring; not sure if it picks up later, but if I spent 2 hours in the tutorials the tutorials need to be nerfed and progression needs to be sped up\n- The inventory takes up half your screen so you can't see jack if you need to pull up stuff in the middle of a fight\n- The knockback on guns is stupidly high\n- Digging feels like a chore considering it's a SP game\n- Progression is completely and totally linear, so it's not actually a rogue-lite\n- Something like 7-8 monsters are recycled with palette swaps\n- Visuals are pretty bad\n- Night defense is kind of silly because you have to build a fort but the monsters can just break your walls\n- The weight physics in the game is just wrong\n- A lot of other things tbh\n\n3/10 - I think there are some okay concepts in there but really the overall product is just unpolished and needs a complete overhaul. Sure it's in EA, but if the end-game product is anything like it is now, I still won't be able to recommend this.","September 12, 2015","false","2.8"," 11 of 33 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","11","33","0","2"

But there are many other problems with this game. Games like this get a lot of indie sympathy, which is a little bit deserved, but the game is bad. I seem to be stuck in one part of the game. I have created my house next to two giant lakes that I made for power. I regret this. I can't figure out how to get the power working, or even a reason to have the power. Only 1 thing in the game needs power, so I created a giant tunnel into the hole to the west for no reason. I was just trying to get rid of the water, but it doesn't go down fast enough, so the lakes won't go away. Also, I can't uprage anything. If I go to the right or left I kill the same mosters and stop and the end of the screen. If I go down I can get more interesting stuff, but by then I've killed like 12 mosters, so 200 monsters are chasing me in the underground by nighttime. Then I probably drown in the water, or get killed in a horrible situation. Like the area with the tentacle moster. I died down there once, right after the day started, so I was stuck down there. I get penalized for everything, digging, exploring, expanding. I always drown or die, or kill so many monsters that my base is overun.

The mining cause of the art style has been made alot easier to tell where the ores are located. If you dont pick easy mode to play the game you are constanly attacked and at night time you are swarmed by the monsters untill day. This is where you huinker down with alot of turrets waiting for day. You cant build any decent protection since the monsters will just dig to your house no matter where you are at. You might as well not build a house and just build a platform to have a line of turrets on. The building system is fun with a chalenge to build correctly so as not to have what you build colapse.

This is a blatant terraria rip off, the starting gun even says "better than a wooden sword" which I assume is refering to the starting sword in terraria. anyway the featurelist is significantly shorter, the game can escalate highly in difficulty if you stumble to far east or west or dig too deep before you're ment too, (you'll be thanking god that turrents exist) and the game isn't really a sandbox like terraria or starbound, thanks to the structure physics which are completely bonkers (somehow reinforced concrete is lighter than a wooden structure?) there's alot of other flaws in the game. Right now you're probably wondering, "then why do you reccomend the game" well I'll tell you that right now. The idea of all monsters you've encountered during playing and either attacked or killed they're entire species won't rest til you're dead and will attack you relentlessly every night. (better make a teleporter asap to ge tback to base before nightfall) is simply genius. It adds alot to the game (until you get to a point where the turrents do all the work anyway but that'll take you awhile) but the best highlight to the game? Is the tiny winy $3 price tag, I got 4-5 hours of enjoyment  from a measely 3 dollars and will probably replay it when it's been updated more. to put it simply it's a good expierence for such a low price and I reccomend buying it and giving it a shot, while it is a blatant terraria rip off, terraria could definitely learn a few things from this game.","March 10, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The physics and combat are amazing especially with harder difficulties. And for less than $3.00, you can't get a better game. The developer seems to be dedicated to this game, he plans on adding a little more to the price with each update until it reaches it's planned full price at around $12.00, so clearly he has a long term plan in place. It has no multiplayer yet, but that is such a highly demanded thing by the community that I'm sure it will be. The construction of defenses, bridges, and towers are extremely fun and have a good amount of skill involved in them. There is little grinding in this game, you get straight into the action which I personally enjoy. The developer took everything good about Terraria and other similar games, mashed them together, picked out the bad parts that didn't compliment eachother, and added many unique features and aspects to finish it off.

The first reason was the introductory price of $3.00, and the second reason being that it looked like it would be fun.\n\nThe game is simplistic in concept:  Explore, Acquire Resources, and prepare defenses for the onset of night.\n\nBut that simplistic concept becomes much more challenging as you progress through the various crafting tiers, not to mention the oft-occuring flash flooding.  You begin to not only plan area defense, but also dig strategically placed water drainage ducts and dams.\n\nThis game can feel relaxing and safe one moment and then quickly become a frantic struggle for survival the next.   For me it brings to mind that old school classic arcade game Dig Dug.\n\nDig or Die itself has a cutesie, arcady graphic vibe, but it works just fine for me.\n\nThe game, in its current state is very playable, very enjoyable and often fast paced.\n\nAs mentioned in other reviews, I agree that it is difficult dealing with the multiple tiered crafting stations. It can be very confusing when it doesn't have to be.  This is most apparent when you are frantically trying to find that recipe you need as you are being swarmed by creatures at night and realize that the crafting station you need as halfway across the world.  - However - with that being said, it does add a strategic element by deciding whether to keep these stations close together, or spread them out between your various attempts at bases - or - just decide if it is worth building duplicate stations at the cost of precious resources.  ;)\n\nIn my opinion, with the game as it is in its current state could easily pass muster for a finished game at $7.00 and probably sell decently.   But this game is in early access and therefore in constant development.  I believe that the developer proves that this is a workable game idea which can stand on its own merit and NOT be compared to a Terraria/Starbound clone.  I also believe that the developer knows what he is doing, has a solid roadmap for this game and a bright future is quite probably ensured.\n\nMy recommendation is to get this game now at the lower price, rather than waiting, because you know by each of these reviews that this game is definitely heading in the right direction.  Get it at the bargain price now, or just wish you had in the future.","March 10, 2015","true","23.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The goal of the game isn't as simple as many would like to think. First, there's fighting monsters, then digging, then searching for rare plants atop a giant mountain - this game has it all. There are many things about this game that stand out to me as a gamer. One being that the blocks have weight. Though the blocks do not fall over if you hit them, they can and will break if you build them as if you were building in Minecraft. For building large structures, there are blocks you can place to hold up ceilings and other roofs. Another thing is water. You'd think that water wouldn't be a problem, but on the planet you're on, it is a huge one. Forget just digging a hole and covering the entrence to survive, because water will drip from the dirt blocks all around you until you decide to put some actual walls up. And did I mention that enemies can dig, too? Yeah, this game is challenging, but that's where crafting comes in. There are 3 tiers of crafting that are actually well-balanced for being a fairly new game. I'm not going to spoil them for you, but they are categorized by different auto-crafters, each one requires the previous to be made. Each tier also has a new turret(s), allowing you to lock down areas of the map with force. They are also your lifeline at night. The most prevalent mechanic in the game is the day and night cycle. Imagine Dying Light, but 10 times worse (in a challenging way). Enemies are absolutely vicious at night, turning the game from adventuring to tower-defense in a split second. You'll need to think quickly in order to survive away from your base at night, or else its GG for you. Thankfully it auto-saves after every night.\n\nOverall, I give this game an 8/10, even though I usually set my limit on early-access/beta/alpha games at 7/10. With the price set at only $3, you have nothing to lose when trying this game.","April 6, 2015","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played through on normal, might go back and give harder difficulties a shot. There's a sharp learning curve in the beginning with the physics and enemy AI. Collecting the loot for the early defenses is also tedious. I almost gave up on it honestly, but gave it another shot after watching the trailer, After what was a slow and rocky star, things moved along nicely progression-wise, Totally worth it for the current price tag of $3 and the demand on your system is so low that the game could run on a toaster.\n\nPros:\n- Realistic physics for building structures\n- Bridge and tower building was fun\n- Smooth combat\n- Nice music\n- Mining doesn't take ages\n\nCons:\n- Not much to explore\n- Little variation for enemies, items and terrain\n- Rough, grindy and somewhat confusing start (might just be me)\n\nNoteworthy:\n- Surviving nights goes from really hard to really easy, at least on normal difficulty\n- Enemy AI was very strange sometimes (a single bee following me across the map for a while, monsters spawning very close to me while digging straight left or right, monsters choosing to dig through an insane amount of ground to get to me)\n\nI'm interested to see how the things fleshed out. As of now, it feels a bit like a section of a bigger game. Fun stuff though, a no brainer to buy and play if you're the terraria/starbound type.","March 17, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfinished in content but what is on show at the moment does seem to point to a bright future. The title does have a end game which is crafting a spaceship to get off the alien home world. The crafting involves collecting the usual, getting gems from flying bugs and using the workbenches to upgrade items. Its not a overly the top system to use and I got the hang of it early on. What sets it apart from other 2D survival games is the tower defence element which is done rather well.\n\nIt also makes you plan how to go about building bases as there is none of that floating blocks you get in minecraft and if you go over the strengths of the building blocks it will all come falling down about you. Another notable mechanic is that this title does better than most, is that you never feel that you get large stop gaps in gameplay where you are clueless on what to work towards next. The title is currently on sale for £1.99 which will go up in price as content is added to the game. At its current price and what is on show I recommend this title at full price as of 26/03/15.","March 26, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really liked your game. But I want to say you something I think you should decrase the mob spawn rate at night there is so much red bees around and also I think you should make their attack damage less because its very hard. I really like it. Im pumped for the updates. See you!","March 7, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not a total waste of time: I had fun building a fortress and putting turrets all over the place so that I could have a place of refuge.  DorD got real easy once I built a few portals.  If more content is added I might play through this game again.  Not bad for the $2.99 I paid.","April 5, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All this and much more to come in its later stages for such a cheap price you cant go wrong.","April 6, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For its price, you get a lot. I personally am really excited to see this as it gets updated.\n\n88/100 There's no reason to not have this in your Library,\n\n","April 6, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
