This is where all of Nosgoth is betrayed." ~Kain\n\nThis game is the third entry of the Legacy of Kain series. Second, if you don't include Blood Omen 1 as that was made by other people technically, but the rest of the Legacy of Kain series was built right off of that game.  Also, I feel this is quite obvious but will post a warning all the same, this review will most likely spoil the first Soul Reaver game. After all, Soul Reaver 2 picks up literally right where Soul Reaver 1 left off, converting the final dialogue between Raziel and Kain of 1 into 2's CGI prologue scene. Kain escapes Raziel's reach by using the time streaming chamber to escape to a much less desolated version of Nosgoth in the past. But Raziel, still the faithful servant of the being only known as the Elder God who ordered him to assassinate Kain at the very beginning of Soul Reaver 1, follows him into the portal fearlessly armed with the Wraith Blade. And then, he meets Moebius. Moebius is a more than dubious character, one which Raziel is rightly suspicious of. Moebius, similar to Raziel's master, the Elder God, pushes him towards executing Kain.\n\nIt doesn't take long for Raziel to gain the ire of both of them. As Raziel encounters the Kain that fled from him not too long after meeting Moebius at the Pillars of Nosgoth and does not kill him. Instead, Kain asks him to witness this pivotal moment of Nosgoth's history: the Corruption of the Pillars. After all, they walk in the first Blood Omen's era, about 30 years before Kain is presented with the choice he is given at the end of the first Blood Omen. Either die as the last vampire and thus bring about the extinction of his race, or allow the pillars to begin to collapse entirely, bringing about the apocalyptic version of Nosgoth you travel through in the first Soul Reaver. Kains tell Raziel to unearth his destiny, and then leaves. And thus, in Soul Reaver 2, you are no longer chasing Kain to assassinate him as Moebius and the Elder God seem so determined, but instead, travel through Nosgoth in several different eras, learning more about your past as a human, the Soul Reaver, and your destiny. There's quite a bit of time traveling in store for you, keep in mind this advice: "History abhors a paradox."\n\nFollowing in Soul Reaver 1's foosteps, Soul Reaver 2 is another action adventure game. The combat and graphics have obviously been improved quite a bit. However, as I said in my Soul Reaver 1 review, it's important to have reasonable expectations. I had less issues with Soul Reaver 2 than I did with Soul Reaver 1, less flickering textures, I could use a 360 controller without installing a program such as Xpadder or something. Still, even Soul Reaver 2 is still almost like fourteen years old. I did have a few crashes, lessso than Soul Reaver 1, but unlike in Soul Reaver 1, you cannot just save anywhere. So if it does crash before you can save, you probably will have to repeat things you've already done. Also, I cannot verify if it'll work on Windows 8 or anything like that. Personally, I played on Windows 7 and it was fine.\n\nThe combat has been updated from Soul Reaver 1 and is in general different. In Soul Reaver 1, often, you found yourself doing your damndest to avoid getting hit because that mean you would lose the Wraith Blade, and if that happened, you would have to either throw your enemy into a fire, pool of water, or into the sunlight to kill them because after all, the majority of enemies in the game were vampiric. In Soul Reaver 2, the most common enemy you'll be fighting will be the Sarafan (humans), these weird creatures made of darkness that appear in parts, and hellish demons that will actually follow you into the Spirit Realm if they knock you into that (that's right, they added enemies actually capable of removing the "no stakes" element of the Spirit Realm). Additionally, while the Wraith Blade still works the way it did in Soul Reaver 1 for a bit in the beginning of Soul Reaver 2 (you keep the wraith blade until you get hit), not long into the prologue, the rules are changed when the Wraith Blade actually meets the past version of itself, the Soul Reaver. The Wraith Blade actually gains a will of its own. The Wraith Blade had always been a soul consuming spirit bound to Raziel and before then, trapped in the Soul Reaver itself, but now it was fully awake. Basically, what this means is, you won't lose the Wraith Blade anymore if you get hurt, but the more you use it, the more a little a ring will fill around your health. If it becomes full, I believe your health will actually begin to drop, although, I'm not too sure. To be honest, I was always mindful of how much I used the Wraith Blade because of this. Plus, I also just used the other weapons you could get from Sarafan and the sort.\n\nThe Spirit Realm remains in Soul Reaver 2, and to be honest, while it's still cool in Soul Reaver 2, I preferred the way it looked in Soul Reaver 1. You maintain most of the abilities you gained from killing your vampiric brothers in Soul Reaver 1, such as phasing through barred barriers and certain doors in the Spirit Realm, climbing certain walls in the Material Realm, actually being able to swim without being immediately sent to the Spirit Realm/basically falling apart (you're essentially a walking corpse after all)... and etc. Where as in Soul Reaver 1 your goal was to kill off your vampiric brothers and then kill Kain, in Soul Reaver 2, you'll find your goal is more along the lines of finding elemental forges to imbue the Reaver with various different elements, along the lines of fire, darkness, light, air, and etc. As there are numerous doors that are locked unless you possess a certain element, and most of these places contain knowledge about things you want to know more about. Plus, you're already there, why not explore a less ruined Nosgoth that isn't infested with vampire spiders? Admittedly, I preferred the boss battles to the forges but... the one final "boss battle" this game does have is awesome for story reasons.\n\nThere's less of this in Soul Reaver 2, but as in the first, if you're stuck and it seems there's no way to progress, enter the Spirit Realm. And also, if you find the enemies that will pursue you into the Spirit Realm if they beat you annoying when they start showing up, it seemed to me that they were actually easier to kill in the Spirit Realm. So keep that in mind. Also, another improvement in the transition to Soul Reaver 2. There's still puzzles, but almost zero block puzzles. Hoorah! Although... there is one thing I was sort of bummed out by. Soul Reaver 1 was linear sure, but it didn't feel that way. There were side areas you could explore, you could save anywhere... but SR2, BO2, and Defiance are all on a checkpoint system. They're still good, but the Nosgoth you explore in SR1's probably my personal favorite.\n\nAs it was with Soul Reaver 1, I definitely recommend this game. The gameplay's certainly improved from Soul Reaver 1, and everything else (the story, the atmosphere, the voice acting, and the music) continue to be excellent. As long as you appreciate old games, yes, absolutely play this game/series. After SR2, only Blood Omen 2 and Defiance remain... and also Nosgoth, I guess. I'd recommend playing Blood Omen 2 between this game and Defiance. Defiance should be the final note you finish playing LoK on, not BO2 for... reasons I'll go into in my inevitable BO2 review.\n\ntl;dr: Absolutely. Legacy of Kain, in the words of the Elder God, "you are worthy."\n\n7.8/10.","September 7, 2015","true","11.3"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","35","36","0","8"

Raziel has plunged through the Chronoplast time portal in his relentless pursuit of Kain and must unearth the mysteries of Nosgoth's ancient races as he travels unabashedly through eras of both the past and the future. Soul Reaver 2 has more in-depth puzzles and improved weapon enhancements, it also introduces a number of elemental mechanics, as well as an increased number of enemies.\nAs with the original Soul Reaver the bigger focus of this game is the puzzles and these have been much improved and far more challenging. You travel to these various dungeons and you will find far fewer block puzzles and instead a large variety of puzzles that use the differences in landscape between spectral and real realms, reflections, wind, light and elemental reaver attributes. As you progress the game you will receive temporary imbuements to the soul reaver for various elements. These give the reaver various abilities and these are used for the majority of puzzles in the game.\nThe Story is where the game really shines. The story is so complicated and well written that it spans five games. It is hard to explain the story, you just have to play the games to understand it.\nThe voice acting is awesome. It is one of the best you will find in any game out there. The music as well is very good, you will find yourself hearing it in your head long after you played this game.\nThe graphics are great for the time. The graphics now are quite decent, less glitches and more enjoyable lightning sprites. They made Nosgoth's appearance more lively and a better transition effect from Spectral Realm to Material Realm than the first one. Raziel and the other characters were well designed.\nThe unique play mechanics of Soul Reaver 2, as well as its impressive graphics and excellent story, make it easy to recommend to fans of action or adventure games.\n\nSounds 9/10\nGraphics 8/10\nGameplay 9/10\nAtmosphere 10/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","December 18, 2013","true","10.2"," 47 of 57 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","47","57","0","0"

That is, depending on your system, terribly.\n\nLots of people have problems with random freezes during cutscenes, which is a pain since save points are often an hour or so apart and you can't even skip cutscenes you've already seen.\n\nThe localized versions of this game, while they exist and are generally considered good quality, are simply not available on Steam. This is English only, and worst of all, this game comes from a time when not having any kind of subtitles was acceptable (way to do accessibiility, by the way).\n\nI don't care how old this game is. If you are republishing it, you have to do basic support. Why are we still paying for it if not this?\n\nUpdate on this : So it appears the frequent freezes are related to processor affinity in multiple core systems (most modern PCs). There are workarounds, none of which are very convenient for end-users. This could be fixed somewhat easily for everyone if Square Enix had any care. For this reason, and for the non-inclusion of versions other than English, I still don't recommend it.","January 3, 2015","false","8.5"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","25","34","0","0"

First, it's an incredible pain in the ♥♥♥ to get a controller working, I had to fiddle with JoyToKey for a long time before getting it right. For a game that was originally released on console, this is unacceptable.\nSecond, and most importantly, the game crashes quite frequently, and considering save points are scarce and the (quite long) cut scenes cannot be skipped, this is *incredibly* frustrating. Also, you have to enable vsync on your graphic card because the screen tearing is monstrous. Audio bugs are also occasionally present, though not to the level of the first game.\n\nI would only recommend the game if you truly cannot get a hold of the PlayStation 2 version at all. PS2 owners, don't bother with double-dipping for the convenience of Steam or the high res or whatnot, and especially not to support the publishers, because they don't deserve your money for this lame cashgrab.\n\nThe game itself is quite good, however. Its graphics aged really well and look very good under modern resolutions, the story and voice acting and atmosphere are as compelling as ever, and the level design is spectacular. The camera isn't perfect, it's rather dated, but it helps to bind it on the right analog stick if you can. Combat, similarly to the camera, is both a bit dated yet serviceable enough, and impaling and beheading enemies still feel satisfying.\n\nIt's too bad this PC port is so shoddy; no effort whatsoever has been made to make it stable and controller-friendly. This game deserves better than a less-than-mediocre port. I bought this in the LoK bundle during a sale at quite a good price, and I still feel ripped off. After a crash happened which made me lose over 90 minutes of progress (including long, unskippable cut scenes) due the scarcity of save points, I simply gave up on this playthrough (since I beat it more than once on PS2 back in the day).","June 29, 2014","false","9.7"," 24 of 45 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","24","45","0","3"

The only power up that you kept from the 1st game was the swim ability and able to go through cage doors or cage walls and the soul reaver thats bound to you for the rest of your life. you have a limited selection of weapons like able to use a a giant butcher knife swords, normal swords, and staffs. The only thing that changes with each weapon is the looks and fighting style, Butcher knife is like a power house weapon that has slashes and slam moves, sword has slash and thrust moves, staff has thrust and beating them with the thing.

I was glad to see that all of them were available on Steam and... I had to give em a try! Last time I played this game was over 10 years ago.\n\nI was first surprised to see how dynamic the whole thing is for such an old game. It's all fast and smooth, from the platform parts to the combat system. Then I had another good surprise when I got stuck with the puzzles or lost as there was not much quest indicators. Games have changed over the years, and not always in a good way.\n\nAfter spending up to an hour running in circles trying different things to get past an obstacle without success I found myself searching the internet to see if I was not just victim of another bug (happened twice during the game). And NOPE. The game was running well. I just didn't make good use of my brain. I was not used to that anymore!\n\nIn most of nowadays games, being stuck on one same thing for such a long time usually means broken game mechanics : You would find solutions such as "Quit/reload/restart/patch the game and it MAY work. Eventually.". Here it was not the case. Everything was working as expected.\n\nWith that in mind and so few map/quest indicators, the only thing left to do is focus on the story and enjoy the ~10 hours this game has to offer.

And overall this is a good game that combines combat and puzzles in the various time periods of Nosgoth. This time around the game is less difficult but still keeps it's challenge. The game keeps the mechanic of shifting between physical and spectral realm. Although the return to the physical realm is a bit changed. So if you die in the physical world you shift to the spectral one. There is a rather visible lack of good/epic boss fights in this sequel and while it does make sense story-wise I have to say it takes away from the gameplay a bit. The story and narrative, reasons why I love this series, remain superb. The story telling is enhanced by (slightly) better graphics, the writing and voice acting are great as always. I like the soundtrack too. The downsides are that the game is old so graphics and compatibility are really lacking (though it is a lot better than SR1), however it runs fine on my Win7 laptop. The ending is reather open again and that can get annoying in this series, though it does finally finish in LoK: Defiance. I really like the Soul Reaver series and as such I have to recommend this one as well, not just because I like it but also because it is a good game worth trying out.","October 30, 2014","true","0.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The story picks up right where the first game ended, so experience the first game before you pick this one up.\nSoul Reaver 2 plays the same as the first game but focuses far more on story progression than gameplay. The game is incredibly linear compared to the first game. While the first game had a linear story progression, you did have the option to backtrack and use new found powers to uncover secret items. This game has absolutely no secrets to find. You follow the path and stick to it, beating up a few bad guys along the way using a very stale combat system. During the game you collect different elemental powers for your Reaver, but they really only act as keys to access new areas instead of providing different effects in combat. Combat wasn't such a problem in the first game because you spent more time platforming, but Soul Reaver 2 doesn't have a lot of that, just running from Point A to Point B. It's also much shorter than the previous game. But you see this doesn't matter at all if you're playing it for the story. Soul Reaver 2 isn't about reaching your goal, it's much more about the journey and uncovering one plot twist after another. There's no 'huge' climax at the end of the game, i honestly didn't expect it to end where it did. It acts as more of a story stepping stone between Soul Reaver 1 and Defiance.Just like in the first game, and maybe more so, you will be driving yourself to reach the next cutscene so you can anser that fundamental question, 'why?'.\nThe voice acting and soundtrack are just as brilliant as the first game. The environment is much less dark and haunting, in fact at the start of the game there's some quite nice scenery.The puzzles get a bit of an upgrade, moving away from block pushing and turning them into something you would find in a Zelda dungeon, but they're not overly hard to solve.\nIf you're in it for the story then this game won't disappoint, it's the only thing that really makes this games many flaws enjoyable.","August 23, 2013","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Take again the Soul Reaver, and put those welps and weaklings to pay. Feed on them, grow, as you find the shackles of destiny, and of time itself, clasp about your wrists.\n\nThis game is gorey, bloody, just as much so as the first.

Your Soul Reaver blade can be used from the start of the game and is a bit OP, that however is countered by a bar which fills the more you use the blade and kill with it, and once filled takes away some of your health, thus forcing you to mix its use with regular weapons, which at least brings some depth to an otherwise humdrum combat system. Speaking of the blade, it can be infused throughout the story with different elements (light, dark, wind & fire) but disappointingly only come into play in puzzles; yet another sign that the combat is undercooked at best.\n-The overall pacing - This took a big nosedive since it opts for a completely linear style, in stark contrast to the exploration-based, open world the previous game had, sacrificing all exploration and collecting of spells / health runes & magic artifacts. Streamlined, yes, but ends up with a dull, empty-feeling world as a result.\n-The music - The songs are bland and unmemorable. Again, another point in which Soul Reaver 1 outshines this entry.\n\nVerdict: 6/10\nMediocre, yet recommendable, however if you're a Legacy of Kain fan, you'll probably enjoy it if only to continue with the damn good storyline of the series, which is, in my opinion, the biggest draw point of this saga.","March 5","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If this game was a cup, it would be overflowing with epicness.\n\nIf you never played it before, you are in for a story you will never forget(most likely you wont understand it either if you havent played previous Legacy of Kain games). Naration is just epic, all voice actors(Kain especially) are very gifted voice actors and will make every cutscene feel amazing. Also, story is well written and leaves little to nothing unexplained but rest assured that after finishing LoK series, all shall be revealed.\n\nSpeaking of gameplay, combat is good, fast and dynamic and fairly challenging at some points.

Story begins right where it ended in SR1, in the time streaming device with Kain...\nRaziel emerges in another century, and begins his journey to uncover his destiny, again. Now, not on a vengeful quest against his former battle-brothers, but on a quest for knowledge, he will face many obstacles. You will open some ancient mysteries, and gain historical insight about the ancient blue-skinned noble vampire race and it's enemies. You will meet some of the guys that you probably already know (if you played the previous installments), like Moebius, Kain, Vorador... and some new.\nSome discoveries during Raziel's inquiry into his own destiny will be quiet suprising.\nThis game is an amazing experience, from many perspectives. As you can imagine from reading my review, the story is outstanding.\nWhat about the rest of the game?\nWell, it's excellent, too\nThe graphics are old and all, but you can ignore it, the desing and art in game is top-level, has a nice gothic feel too it. Overall looks good even today.\nKurt Harland did a great job making soundtrack for the sequel, it's admirably written. Sound desing imbues the atmosphere with a gothicness and darkness.\nThe gameplay is similar to the first game, it's a 3rd action adventure with enough of platforming and some nice puzzles. Overall, there's an impovment in most of the areas. Combat mechanics are much more fluid, same goes with probably everything.\nRecommend playing this game with a gamepad, it's clearly was ment for consoles, so if you have one, don't bother with keyboard (though, it's still playable, but not as enjoyable in my point of view)\nFor all fans of the first game this is a must\nFor those who want to get in to the story of this franchise, this might be your best choice. It's a bit easier than it's predecessor, more fluid and more pleasing to the eye, so yeah, could get you interested easier.\nDo strongly recommend this gem!","March 9, 2015","true","7.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The bottom line for veteran gamers is that you likely know what you're getting into for round 2: a freeze bug coupled with a horrible checkpoint saving system coupled with no gamepad support.  I mean, the first time I played this it was on PC with keyboard/mouse but this time around I'm really noticing how the autoface and combat system would be better served with a gamepad.\n\nI love this series.  I love it.  That's out of the way.  Unfortunately, this is the weakest link in said series.  Blood Omen 2 beats this game in enjoyability.  This game drove me insane.  Imagine spending 35 minutes doing platformer puzzles only for a freeze bug to stop you from saving TEN FEET FROM THE SAVE CHECKPOINT SPOT.  THEN YOU DO THE WHOLE PUZZLE THING ALL OVER AGAIN.  A lot of that.  A lot of jumping over and running past enemies because it just got old and repetitive.  The only driving force was progressing the story, even when it involved walking through the exact same map (oooh but it's in a different time, so it's okay!?) and dealing with the spirit plane and poorly placed planar portals (forgive the alliteration) and running down the same lonnnnnnng hallways because you didn't do something correctly.\n\nThe problem is that a veteran gamer doesn't give up.  This game should be rated extremely difficult on the basis of computer glitches and frustration, despite how relatively simple it is as a game itself.  If you manage to finish this whole game whilst suffering through compatability issues, I salute you.  This was not easy for me.  By all means continue the legacy of kain, whether you're familiar or a newcomer, but if you are not looking for reminiscence or gamer cred, I recommend looking up a youtube compilation of all the story cutscenes, and moving straight on to either Blood Omen 2 or preferrably Defiance.\n\nI didn't recommend the first Soul Reaver on Steam because of a sound error that was easily corrected thanks to the save anywhere feature.  Praying that the game didn't freeze before I reached a save point had me ripping my hair out in Soul Reaver 2.  Play if you have spare time or if you just have to, because we've all been there.  We've all played the worst most frustrating games just out of the completist OCD'ness that accompanies our weird generation.\n\nOtherwise, please do not do this to yourself.","March 25, 2015","false","13.1"," 16 of 32 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","16","32","3","0"

Soul Reaver 2 has more mixed reception from both critics and fans alike.\n\nIt's not hard to see why. One of the most replayable elements to the original was it's sidequests. Littered throughout the world were unique power ups that required progressing through the story and getting abilities inorder to unlock. In Soul Reaver 2 there is none of this. You progress through the same overworld continuously, only changing when you switch between time periods. Which really only causes the time of day to shift or snow to appear.\n\nAs much as I'd like to recommend Soul Reaver 2. It's essentially a stripped down version of the original.

The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe bad stuff out of the way first: there's a bigger emphasis on combat. While it can be fun to fight the weaker enemies, the game introduces progressively difficult ones, and the battle system is not as responsive as it could be. As such, you may try to evade an attack only to end up hit, often several times in a row, which is annoying. You can, however, bypass a considerable number of encounters and you can always use the reaver to speed things up (although it starts feeding on your energy if you overuse it).\n\nThe other thing is that Soul Reaver's design felt more organic whereas the sequel's linearity is not as well disguised.\n\nEverything else, though, is much, much better. Better and more varied puzzles (gone are the block puzzles), more dialogue and monologues, more substantial story (still ends on a cliffhanger), better graphics and overall better controls. Kain and Raziel's dynamic is much more interesting and there is significant progress in Raziel's character. The voice-acting is still incredible, the writing is, as before, very compelling and it's a delight hearing the characters interact with each other. You also have access to the full script in-game, if you're interested in that kind of thing (you should be interested in this case).\n\nLong story short: this game is baller as ♥♥♥♥.","January 11, 2013","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was my favorite game for well over a decade due to its incredible story. The combat was ahead of its time and the puzzles were fun and could be quite challenging. Steam will say that I have only a short amount of time with this game, but that's only because, due to some technical issues with Windows 10, I've been forced to run the game through a different launcher in order to play. If you're running windows 10 or having issues, read on.\n\nSadly, on Windows 10 and some other newer operating systems, the game can present some major glitches that make it unplayable. These are fixable, but it requires the use of a 3rd party program called DXWND. Some threads I've looked through suggest that the problems can be solved by simply forcing on vsync, but, at least for me, that didn't work, and I tried it through multiple programs and methods. DXWND was the only thing that worked for me. For those interested, these are the settings in DXWND that worked for me:\n\nDirectX 8\nFullscreen only (uncheck Run in window)\nResolution: Monitor Native\nLimit the FPS with a delay of 1msec\n\nEverything else I left as default. This worked for me and got the game up and running at 1080p with near perfect 3D Vision support. If you're having issues switching between planes, swimming, or going through enemies when attacking, this will fix it.","February 23","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had this game on the playstation 2, I remember a lot about it. More than anything though, I remember the cutscenes. Interaction between characters who would jawjack each other for so long, you could make a grilled cheese and a pot of chicken noodle from scratch (start it boiling anyway) and still get to see the end of the cutscene.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pixelcop/recommended/224940/","pixelcop","dextrous","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pixelcop/","146 products in account","I preferred the first Soul Reaver, that's for sure. And yet, this improved on many things - as I started the game, I was very happy with the upgrades in graphics and animation during cutscenes as well as a definite upgrade in dramatic vampire sass (feat. Raziel vs Kain) Also, I REALLY enjoy this franchise's story, and Soul Reaver 2 does not disappoint in that aspect.\n\nGameplay/combat system was inferior, however. The first SR was great because the "play" was unique - the realm switching lore-motivated no-game-overs style and creative use of environment to defeat enemies was the charm of it.\nSoul Reaver 2 dropped all that. Sure, it still kept the spectral realm but it didn't serve the same purpose anymore. New enemies introduced that follow you into the spectral realm can actually kill you there now - sending you back to your latest checkpoint. This seemed purposeless? It throws you back into the standard way games handle health and trial & error, which felt like a stepback. The spectral realm may just as well have been removed completely. The only thing you do in the spectral realm that you can't do in the material realm is distort the environment to be able to scale certain walls.\n\nFighting anybody in Soul Reaver 2 was also incredible tedious, in my personal opinion.  Sure, these vampire hunters are doing their job splendidly when they gang up on you and poke you repeatedly with long halberds and spears, stunning you and often negating your dodges. While I don't wish for it to be EASIER, I just felt like there was no time during combat to catch a break. I was dodging constantly, and still suffered so many blows that it simply wasn't feasible to use the Reaver against enemies. (This may have been a PC port issue? I can't be sure.)\nThe Reaver is a few-hits-kill weapon in SR2, for a price; if you kill an enemy with it, their soul will instantly be devoured by the Reaver itself - leaving you with no way to replenish your health. On top of that, if you use the Reaver too much, it will start feeding directly on your health.\nWithout the Reaver equipped, the souls of your enemies will stick around for you to devour - however, when faced with multiple enemies, it is difficult to find the time and space to have your meal - if you stop, most likely, another enemy will start pummeling you. And sometimes, that means your meal will escape. (Don't even get me started on the enemies with projectile attacks)\nSo... Tedious.\n\n(Side note: I'm neutral about the sountrack for SR1 but the spectral realm music for certain areas in SR2 was Really Annoying and was mostly noise. It didn't help that it was usually failure in combat that sent me back to it )\n((The portals for materializing back were also waaay more spread out than SR1 so it was a chore to rematerialize))\n(((The enemies of the spectral realm were just as tedious as the material ones)))\n\nIn conclusion I have a lot of bones to pick with how SR2 was played - however, the story was great and made me eager still to pick up the next title. I may not completely grasp every detail yet but it does a good job of capturing me and making me curious to read up on the lore, which I usually don't like to do.\n(And to reiterate, I loved the upgrade in animation even though it's not perfect. Most scenes were actually choreographed properly, instead of just pose-and-talk-with-camera-pans that a lot of games do.)\n\n(also don't be fooled by my in-game hours, steam keeps counting while paused, and there was pausing aplenty since save locations are so far apart)","October 7, 2015","true","29.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's where the good things end.\nAs soon as I hit "Start Game", a calamity of bad things started happening. The opening cutscene didn't work, black screen with sped up audio. The combat is all over the place and then one of the key mechanics, plane shifting, didn't work either. When I shifted to the spectral realm, I was unable to move and the environment didn't change. Because of this, I was unable to leave the starting area.\nI feel it's only fair to judge it on the basis of being an old game, but also for being an old game that is still being sold.\n\nI cannot recommend it to anyone, and I'm saddened by this, because I heard so much great stuff about the Soul Reaver series before experiencing this train wreck.

Besides widescreen problems, the game runs fine at 60 frames a second.\n+The story continues and, like the first game in the series, it is masterfully written.\n+The puzzles are pretty good.\n+You can use the wraith blade whenever you please, which is very, very good--see below.\n\nCONS:\n+/- The game repeats itself a little too much. You run through the same areas at least three times. It reminds me of the hub-style gameplay of the first game, but it's done much worse. But it pales in comparison to the other issues.\n\nCONS:\n-This is the worse game in the series when it comes to the combat. It a phrase: It's broken. You have a heavy attack and can block now, nice; but the heavy attack is too slow to hit and the enemies' block does not reduce their health, nor does it ever break. You almost HAVE to use the reaver to kill enemies. The AI is horrible, too, since it will keep striking you without pause, not even letting a single hit in. It gets annoying when the enemies can both block everything you have and instantly 7hit combo you to death.\n-There are too many enemies. This game obviously has enemy placement that feels copy-paste, almost to the point that I wanted to stop playing.\n\nAll in all, this is the worst game of the series, lagging behind Soul Reaver one, and bounds worse than much better Blood Omen 2. I'd only recommend this game if you want to see how the story plays out, but even then, you can easily read a synpopsis on this one (or just the script) and be fine.\n\n","January 13","false","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
