Has a decent selection of tracks, ai drivers are a decent challenge where they will try pass other drivers in smart places and not just push you off the track like a horny moose.\n\nThe biggest thing for me is that this game has great driving physics. Cars handle like you think they would. When you drive a small front wheel drive car you notice how nimble it is through the corners and has very little understeer and the bigger american muscle cars feel heavy with lots of torque. There are close to 100 different cars and you unlock them as you play through the career. You can adjust almost everything on them either with simple sliders for oversteer/understeer, stiffness and ride height to more advanced setup where you can change camber and so on.\n\nGraphics are ok with decent textures and nice lighting effects for the time. Exterior damage modelling is very minimal but collisions do feel like they have some weight to them even though sometimes side to side collisions can feel a bit akward, but still you can push cars and make them spin. Very playable with older hardware and newer aswell. Also supports 21:9 aspect ratio monitors. Driving feels nice even with a gamepad, though oversteer can be difficult to control with such sensitive controls. I would recommend a good FFB wheel with this. I have not personally tested how it is with a wheel but support for all kinds of wheels and controllers are there and are very configurable with sensitivity, dead zones and so on. (I will try to add my thoughts later on about how it feels with a wheel since at the moment I don't have a good place to install my Fanatec CSR wheels, pedals and shifter.)\n\nMy favorite moments from the game are when you are playing the "david vs goliath" on career mode where you have to drive with a small and not too powerfull Lotus Cortina against big muscle cars like The Mustang. In the straightaways you get passed easily but if you carry lots of speed through the corners you can almost oversteer past them.\n\nThe game is very moddable, nogrip and other forums has a ton of beatifully modelled cars and tracks, period correct of course.","July 21, 2015","true","28.4"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","19","19","0","0"

Going from a Lotus Cortina, to a Ford Mustang, to a Chevrolet Corvette, to a Ford GT is great.  The speed difference is notable in each jump, and the engine noises, especially from Cortina to Mustang, is awesome.\n\n7) Physics are crazy.

This game is from 2005, so the graphics are outdated, although that doesn't bother me. I find the tracks and landscape suffer the most, but the cars themselves look great! The lighting is particularly good on the cars and everywhere else. You can race anytime of day, and night races are fun (I always end up breaking a headlight tho *oops*). Though, you cannot race in the rain unlike GTR2, however this is okay because driving these 60s/70s cars in the rain would be a struggle.\n\nControls/Difficulty: I got this game a long time ago before I was even old enough to fit in a driver's seat (much to the disdain of the elder British lads that I wrecked in multiplayer long ago), but I enjoyed it oh so much. If you are playing it with a keyboard, good luck racing on professional or semi-pro mode. With a keyboard, you pretty much need traction control, automatic shifting, and anti-lock brakes, therefore you can only be competitive on amateur difficulty. If you have a wheel and pedals and a shifter, then it'll be awesome, especially if you have a clutch pedal and H shifter. There's really no need to play on novice or beginner difficulty unless you really are new to racing games or are just a young kid. (Fun fact: it took me until this year to learn how to pit, however you won't really need to until the endurance races)\n\nPhysics/Realism: The driving physics are rather good. The crashes are very unrealistic however and it's very easy to flip your car and roll about five times before landing on your roof (and still being able to drive afterwards). Glitches are pretty fun, as well.\n\nGameplay: You go through a career mode where you race from 2 to 8 circuits per event and accumulate points and win a trophy if you finish between first and third in points at the end. You start with a Mini and a Lotus Cortina and race up to faster cars (Mustang, Elan, Corvette, Pantera, 911... etc.) by either winning them or earning enough credits to buy new (old) cars. You also unlock more tracks along the way. I haven't played multiplayer in such a long time, but back in the day I used to joyride in my Ford Falcon on the grass & dirt (on purpose) at Donington Park. The Europeans loved me.\n\n\ntl;dr ~\nYou can drive (wreck) cars that are now worth millions!","July 1, 2015","true","59.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

That's largely in part to the huge mod content available.\n\nCompared to the hundreds of cars that games like Gran Turismo and Forza have ballooned into, even the modding community can't offer a comparable volume on that front, but it makes up for that in the quality of many of the car liveries (or "skins") and sheer volume of race tracks. You won't find a console racing game or many PC ones that offer the volume of race tracks you can download for GT Legends (and presumably its sister games, too). At the moment, I have more than 100 tracks installed, and there are lots more available. Not only can you find different tracks from around the world, and a few made-up ones, but some classic tracks -- such as Le Mans, Spa, Monaco, Nurburgring, and others -- offer some of their various incarnations over the years. In short, I've never seen a racing game offer more opportunites to race the tracks you've always wanted to race.\n\nThe visual quality of the tracks varies, some looking plain and dated, with textures like roads and trees looking painful old in some, but pleasantly realistic in others. This is also true for the creativity of the "fantasy" tracks, some a little bland, but others achieve what they advertise very well, like the "Moorlands" track looking like it came right out of Wuthering Heights.\n\nBesides the mods, the game offers suprisingly good-looking cars and still some of the most impressive natural-light effects, particularly at dawn and dusk and how the light looks on the cars.\n\nThe "sim" aspect is also mixed. Having never raced real cars (much less any like these old ones), I can only compare the sim authenticity to my instincts and the closest game equivalent I've played -- namely, Forza. It feels a little overcooked in parts, with certain physics seeming oversensitive, like the grass and sand feeling more like ice; some cars getting lost in a slide that renders counter (or any) steering ineffective; cars flip too easily and overreact to some contact; some cars' inability to hold a straignt  line under braking. Not only do they feel overdone, but vindictively so, too often pushing it beyond challenge into unbearable irritation. In short, while some of the over/understeer and other physics are impressive and satisfying, there seem to be just as many elements that make this as aggravating as often as it can be fun.\n\nPerhaps some of the over-fidgityness of the cars are avoided by using a racing wheel instead of a controller, like I'm using (PS3), which also doesn't recognize any rumble/feedback.\n\nAlso vexing, on the single player side is the poor balancing of AI and grid competition, and the relative uselessness of many cars in a mixed grid. That means that the number of actually usable cars -- in terms of being able to win the races on the harder difficulties -- is limited. You are stuck with whatever car you pick for all the races in a particular "tournament", so there are really only two or three choices (at most!) to give yourself a realistic chance of winning on pro or semi-pro. I imagine you can find (or create) online one-make races, though, that would allow you to drive all these nice classic rides.\n\nUltimately, the well-aged visuals, the mixed but overall still adequate sim-racing experience, and the gobs of mod content (most notably, the tracks!) makes this a must-have for  serious racing game fans.","July 25, 2014","true","19.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I started playing this game at the age of 5 thanks to my father. he bought one of those Microsoft Sidewinder FB wheels to use with the game. i spent days just watching my father play this game for hours. untill i asked if i could test play. sure i was short so i could not reach down to the pedals so i had to use the buttons on the steering wheel. it was hard i got to admit at the age of 6-8 i could finnaly reach down to the pedals and be able to drive the cars in manual. i spend thousands of hours into the game. i beated the game on every diffeculty at that point my father bough one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computers you got from work. and bough a second copy of the game and another wheel. for him. and we decided to go head to head on each other. he was always faster and always better then me. so i decided to skip school... just to be able to beat him in the game. it was a bad idea really bad idea.\n\nbut i did beat him. with the legendary Ford GT40. that is where i fell in love with cars. my dream back then was to get my self a GT40 but yea guess where that dream went. however the game features alot of old school cars like BMW, De Pantera, Ford, Jaguar, Abarth, Ferrari, Porsche. now you might ask. "Why the ♥♥♥♥ is this dude talking about all of this?" well... the answer is. i grew up with this game. i have spent more hours into this game then i have spent on any game in my steam library combined. (dont let the steam time fool you. this was before it was on steam) the game comes with 16 diffrent car manufactures. 11 tracks + short version or long versions. the game allows modding to any part. The online community is still alive and kicking but you need to play in a group. or just have LUCK that someone is still having a public server open.\n\nBut why do i acctualy rekommend the game?\n\nwell... take it like this... there are not many games that takes you back to the 1960s and 1970s most games today are just about graphics and DLC's. this game dont give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about that. NO DLC's pure Simulator game. the engine might be outdated and the physics in the game might be ♥♥♥♥ing dumb somtimes. but it's a great game. the ai's are acctualy tough and will do anything just to get to first place. even if it means that they have to push you off the track...\n\nSadly the game DO lack some features. like blue flag. black flag. yellow flag. you dont have the options to change the settings in the game. like the diffeculty of the AI. if you choose proffesional you will have hard ai's no matter what. the game are missing some cars that was in the 60 and the 70 racing with these classes. but there is mods out there that adds those cars. i higly rekommend atleast test the game (downloading illegaly or borrowing a friends copy) and the sound in the game is just PURE porn. the corvette C2 sounds just pure amazing. i do rekommend playing trough the game vanilla BEFORE you start modding it.","July 2, 2013","true","50.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

So how do sim-racers see the difference? Well you can only find out by asking, so I did.

Old touring cars, real tracks, pretty much infinate mods. £5 of my money well spent, very well spent. Also on the full settings it will never go under 80fps. I want more games like this and rFactor, modifiable masterpieces that you can do almost anyhting to it and it will never crash. Get this game, even if you dont have much money, its a cheap buy and well worth it.","March 18, 2014","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The old cars are a blast to drive, and with the unlock code, plus extra skins you can end up with a LOT of cars. Not to mention the Modding community that has added lots of tracks as well.\nIt's not Gran Turismo 5, or Forza 4 - but it's entertaining anyway. :)","November 29, 2012","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've had this game since 2005, and I still adore it to this day, the magic of this game is still alive and well for me. All of the cars handle beautifully, tons of fun to drive, drifting around corners and on the limit. The wide range of cars you can choose from is fantastic as well, from your Mini Coopers to your Porsche 911's. And if that isn't enough, there's a great deal of mods you can choose from as well on various websites! Career mode is awesome as well, plenty to do and bags of fun. Only flaw I'd say with this game is that the AI can be derpy sometimes on a select few of tracks. ie Imola with the tyres. But about 80% of the time, there fine.\n\n9/10.","February 2","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
