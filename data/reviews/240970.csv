All the gameplay you know and love from the first game is back and upgraded just a tad for more dynamic fights without losing its original feel. If you've played the first game you'll have a good time seeing some subtle callbacks, but if you're jumping into the series with this game you'll still have a grand time; skipping the first game in no way makes the game any less fun.\n\nOutside of fighting, there's so much to be done. Weapon crafting, skill leveling, bonus content you purchase using gold saved up from missions, and so forth. It's so easy to climb your way up to 100% completion and yet so difficult to successfully achieve that goal with such a large number of tasks to complete. You won't be left feeling like you didn't have enough to do.\n\nPlus there's a leaderboard for benchmark testing the game on your computer so you can compare your results to other players for whatever reason.

Do not feel disheartened if you completed the first mission set ---- Your journey is just the beginning! If you are a completionist, check out the gallery and unlock artworks, videos and soundtracks by finishing the game! The only complain I have is only the music transition while fighting against the enemies while not on any mission, since it gets rather repetitive. Steam Workshop support allows map creation for increased gameplay value.\n\nFor the options, each gamepad and keyboard bindings can be customized to your liking and for the first time, occulus VR mode on a 2d game(?).\n\nExperience great soundtrack (especially the main menu!), improved battle (now you have skills, class, party and formation) and having the money-minded goddess along with your journey, HMH fans and newcomers will love it!","April 4, 2014","true","130.6"," 87 of 91 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","87","91","0","2"

Goddess whims, the new feature in multiplayer mix things up nicely, with levels being doubled and gold being taken away at every turn. Also the inclusion of community created maps is a nice touch, giving this game literally infinite lifespan.\nAn absolute treat for RPG fans who are looking for something a little different, or anyone for that matter.\nMy one and only nitpick with this game is the fact there is no volume settings for sound and music, only allowing each to be turned off and on.\nOther than that though, it's definitely worth €19.99 for all the content you recieve.\n\nI have yet to touch upon the single player aspects of the game, but I know for sure I will not be disappointed. When I do get stuck into the story, I'll update this review.\n\n\n","April 4, 2014","true","5.3"," 42 of 50 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","42","50","0","0"

While the first one had several frantic levels to complete, this one has periods of calm to make yourself stronger at a slower rate, before you gain temporary levels at a rapid rate in quests. The soundtrack is intense, with the quests having pumped up, energetic sounds.\n\nThis one has quite a bit more depth to the way you manage your equipment and party. You can actually position everyone and give them little orders, and you can also select a skill to randomly fire upon landing a hit.\n\nThe story this time around is highly engaging. There is less humour in the first chapter of this adventue, but it makes up for this lacking with a web of character relations and situations. The fate of the characters are actually of high interest this time around. The story also brings back several moments from the first game.\n\nThis is a more modern, better written Half-Minute Hero.","April 4, 2014","true","47.5"," 37 of 44 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","37","44","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/recommended/240970/","kryskiller666","BadassFreeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/","217 products in account","I have been waiting for a long time to play this game, waiting for a good sale, and even if I only found a 50% one on this Summer Sale, oh man, if it was worth it.\n\nHalf Minute Hero: The Second Coming is, as you might have know, the sequel of "Half Minute Hero; Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy" (the hell is going on with the names, man?), and it does fell true to the first one, while being original on his own.\n\nThe story picks up on the year 200, 100 years after the first one, and as the original one, has multiple stories (5 in total, the first one being a bit short as the introduction and tutorial, while the last one is pretty much the ending and final battles), most of them with their own characters, like in the original (the Hero Mode, Princess mode, Evil Lord mode, and Knight mode on the original).\n\nThe main thing that has changed here is the seriousness. This game is more serious than the last one, where half the stages where filled with parodies, jokes, easter eggs and references. There are still some quite hillarious stages, but nowhere near before. Instead, you can find parodies and references in the story, maps, and even the items (really? The bike and Buster Sword from Cloud? I rather wear Vivi's outfit...).\n\nThe soundtrack is f#cking boss. I'm not even kidding. Not only it sounds way better while having the same style, but each episode of the game has multiple themes for each battle and map. And I can tell you, the music just gets better the further you go into the game.\n\nOne main problem is the difficulty...It might be that I'm a Badass, or something, but I found it a bit easy. Specially with the "Global Level system", and the "Global Dungeons". The idea is that you can level up out of the stages, so when you start your next battle, you will start at level 5 or so, instead of level 1. The Global dungeons are a good adition, but it's way TOO easy to level up in them, while searching for the loot on them.\n\nAnother trouble I find on this game, is that the story doesn't have multiple routes like the original. Further more, while in the original there where multiple ways to finish a stage, here there are not much of those. There are, though, some secret companions that are not easy to find, and usually need some backtracking to get (like Cozain, who you will need a guide to find, like me).\n\nSomething that has also been done well, are the cameos. A good amount of characters from the original can be found in here: Allied characters, the other heroes of the game, some Evil Lords...Even the main character itself! Most of them will join you in some way, and only a few of them will serve of any way on the story (like Geezer, who I'm not gonna spoil who he is, since it's quite obvious, but appears in all the chapters, helping the heroes). The new Formation system also makes the allies feel a bit more usefull than before, and now both you, allies and enemies have skills...Even though they appear out of chance, making them pretty luck-based.\n\nSomething great, and that I wanted really bad on the game, is the Map Editor. I mean, IT'S PERFECT! Now you can make your own maps, or download the maps from others, play them alone, or with friends! It makes the game last much more, and it's something that A LOT of games should have by default.\n\nWhile it took me about 14 hours to unlock most of the original Half Minute Hero, I have played this one for 20 hours, and I'm nowhere near getting everything (Dude, the Demon Maze is a nightmare...). I would totally recommend this game, SPECIALLY if you played the first one. 20€ is a bit too much, though, so wait for a sale like I did. 10€ or less is a good price, and you should buy it from that point. There are probably DLC's for this game, I haven't checked them yet, but you could also buy them to extend the game, if you want.","June 29, 2014","true","38.5"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","0"

Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","261 products in account","If you LOVED the first title you'll...\n\n...feel torn on this one.\n\nIt's not a bad game. Like all sequels it does everything its predecessor did with bells and whistles added. Unlike the previous title, you get an art gallery, unlockable costumes for the Time Goddess, and  a more cohesive plotline with cutscenes and character development.\n\nBut that's what's off-putting for some. The first title had miniature 30 second quests selected from a world map where the boss, area, and quest were all self-contained. The bosses were made to be humorous and you'd get a small 4 sentence 'epilogue' to the quest that had a joke or two in it. The plot-line was backdrop: it merely explained why you were traveling the world.\n\nThe Second Coming places the plot in center-row and heavily emphasizes it. You get cut-scenes pre and post quest, flashbacks while you travel the world map, and character exposition and development. Bosses are no longer humorous with ridiculous motivations for their actions: they are taken much more seriously. Granted, we aren't dealing with Final Fantasy levels of writing and exposition, but the humor is considerably toned down. You'll either appreciate the expansion or hate it vehemently.\n\nThere were some casualties in transitioning to a story-driven game. Whereas you were timed in the previous title and graded on it after a quest, this game merely continues on with the storyline after a quest is finished. They've done away with the quest completion screen, which details your time and objectives completed, so the game places less emphasis on speed-running. Ironically, time is less emphasized in the series than ever before.\n\nThe sequel DOES fu*k up in two indisputable ways: the ability to go back to completed quests in a time trial mode and the ability to level up in the over-world map. When you level up outside of a quest, your level carries over to the next quest. Which means the element of grinding is introduced in a series where a 30 second quest's challenges include getting strong enough to defeat a boss. You can realistically grind outside of a quest so that when you enter it you're already set to beat the boss, which is beyond ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in this series. Secondly, while you can go back to completed quests to beat the clock, you keep all of your current equipment and levels, which is doubly insane and defeats the point of the 30 second timer and a time trial challenge.\n\nGranted, you don't NEED to grind, ever. But the fact that it's even an option is just as bad as auto-aim in a PC FPS.\n\nTwo ♥♥♥♥-ups aside I'm really split on this game. The previous title had a more arcade-like feel and you could pick up and play it whenever and put it down a minute later. This title has a more continuous feel to it, and in transitioning to a serious RPG some of the humor of the last title is lost. I miss bosses that wanted to blow up the world because others confused their species for a similar looking species. But it's still an enjoyable title that tries something new with the base 'Half-Minute Hero' experience still lying underneath.\n","June 17, 2015","true","35.1"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","32","39","0","0"

With a good mix of RPG, puzzle, and action all packed into one hilarious RPG which lampoons pretty much everything in those games. You have several stories to go through which span an impressive plot which is told in a series of (technically) 30 second levels. The characters are colorful and the gameplay is amazingly fun. Keeping in touch with true frantic action, you must make all your choices quickly, lest those 30 seconds you have be wasted, or you could always pay the stingy Time Goddess.\n\nThe game is extremely fun, with the game keeping the pedal to the metal at all times. The story and dialogue gloriously pokes and prods fun at many tropes present in video games, from forcing you to pick a specific choice to giant robots (who doesn't love giant robots?)! This game, like its predecessor, has an overarching story that encompasses several campaigns following different heroes of different eras, all helped by the Time Goddess.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, but fun. You'll find yourself smiling as you plow through fields or Global Dungeons looking for EXP, gold, and items. During missions, you have to balance time and money, adding a strategic / tactical aspect to each and every mission. Do you plow through to the boss and risk being too weak or grind your levels until you're strong enough? Not only there, there's plenty of secrets in the game that'll keep you engaged for awhile as well.\n\nThere's also a map creation system where you can create your own maps to play and download creations of other players, to further add to the content of this game!\n\nIt also has a multiplayer function, though I've yet to try that out.\n\nOverall, it's an amazing game that is definitely worth the price tag that it has.\n\nUnfortunately for me, the Time Goddess noticed I called her stingy and has taken all my money, my shoes, and my shirt.\n\nThankfully, I still have my pants. Wait, no. She took those too.","July 11, 2014","true","23.7"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","1"

If you can't make it in time you lose.\nThe soundtrack is one of the best I ever heard, Is composed by multiple people but one of these guys is Motoi Sakuraba, the artist who made the Dark Souls soundtrack.\nMy last words are please buy this game, support the company!

I saw this ages ago and did not get it. I did play the first one but the first game had plenty of problems in it (Such as quests being nearly identical to each other and not much variety in them). That was a stupid decision. This game fixes all the problems in the first game and makes it a almost perfect game. Here's how.\n\nStory:\nThere are 4 (5? I'm on Ragnarok at the minute and I don't really know if there is more.) eras to play in this game. They all have different stories. The eras are Overture, Judgement, Revolution and Ragnarock. Judgement is a kind of part 2 to Overture so it does not have a different protagonist unlike the others. I will only explain the Overture story because 1. I don't want to spoil much. 2. I don't want to waste time on a review. So overture follows the story of Yusha. A royal commando sent on a mission to destroy the Evil Lords alongside a group that contains Yashu and Guy. The Evil Lords get their hands on the Spell of Destruction. This spell makes the world end in 30 seconds. Thus the 30 second gimmick. Wow. I thought Overture had a bit more to the story that I could say without spoiling anything. Anyway over to the gameplay.\n\nGameplay:\nThis really is the highlight of the game. So basically you are hunting Evil Lords and ♥♥♥♥. They use their Spell of Destruction to make the world end in 30 seconds. This means you only have 30 seconds to teach the Evil Lord a lesson. Each quest (level) starts off with the Godess telling you things that may help you  defeat the Evil Lord. Each Evil Lord has their own quirk. For example. The Light boss blinds the player with light every few seconds and can be defeated using some kind of dark energy. Anyway the actual gameplay. After the godess tells you ♥♥♥♥, you need to scurry around the map and take out monsters to level up and talk to villagers. You're basically trying to level up as fast as you can and take down the evil lord before 30 seconds is up. However you can pray to the Time Godess to reset your time however it costs money to do so. There is more to the gameplay but I gotta type this quick so whoop.\n\nMusic:\nOh my god. Oh my actual god. This music. This is SO good. I have been listening to this all week. It really is a pleasure to listen to. It's basically chiptune mixed with normal stuff. It is such a good blend. There is not much I can say about the music apart from its amazing.\n\nGraphics:\nIt's pixel art. Nuff said. OH WAIT! I almost forgot about the animation parts. Okay so there are small parts of this game that are animated. These are pretty cool i guess. I mean they dont really show it off that much and the animation does not have a lot going on in it so yeah.\n\nOverall Half Minute Hero: The Second Coming is a great game and I highly reccommend the game. It is fun, addicting and...fun. So what are you waiting for? Buy it now! Heck, You get the first Half Minute hero with it.\n\n8/10\n","March 5, 2015","true","18.2"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","16","17","2","2"

The addition of freeroaming, the connected world, global level and permanent companions are just a few additions that made this game much more enjoyable than Half Minute Hero 1 (which I already liked). There are tons of hidden items, achievements, formations, companions, dungeons... you name it. The dialog and story is typical in the style of a cheesy JRPG. Not my taste but it's a minor complaint. While the very core gameplay is truthful to that of it's predecessor, the content compared was quadrupled. You can expect 20 hours of gametime, for completionists it's easily double.

Pretty much what you would expect from playing the first game but what is different here is how the quests are bigger, theres overworld exploration, and even little dungeons you can go through without worrying about the time in between quests. The game also has roughly twice as much content in the story compared to the first. As for more gameplay you got time attack, infinite battle, multiplayer, and the custom levels you can make and play.\n\nSo about the story I can say its pretty good. Starts off from where the last game left off but this time around it parodies the RPGs around like the SNES and PS1 era with more drama and character development (similar to that one quest in the first game). Even with that It still keeps its humor and makes me smile at some parts of it.\n\nWith all that I say its worth checking out.","June 22, 2014","true","51.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's worth sitting through those for those brilliant silly Half-Minute Hero moments though, and there are more than enough of them to justify sitting through the boring overall story.\n\nThis has a lot more features than the original game, which I've got mixed feelings about.\nClasses don't do much, but they're a nice idea. Battle formations are awesome. Searching for medals on the overworld? Eh, why not. I'm indifferent about skills and Hero Castle stuff, though I think a lot of people would probably like those. I don't know.\n\nSince you can now grind on the overworld for permanent level ups, and are allowed to keep the gear you've obtained in later quests even when redoing quests, there's never any point in strategizing as to which gear and path will let you earn the best time, as you can just come back later in the game with max levels and the best equipment, and redo the quest with no challenge. Maybe I'm being too harsh as there's a separate Time Attack mode that plays more like the original, but I just don't see the appeal of redoing story quests in a different mode.\n\nThis game is much more friendly to newcomers and casual players than the original was, and so it is the best place to pick up the series, though veterans of the original may be disappointed that it's nowhere near as challenging.\n\nStill a great game though, and I had a ton of fun with it despite all the things I've nitpicked about it. I definitely recommend both Half-Minute Hero titles to anyone who's a fan of retro console JRPGs, and since you get the first game for free with this one, my complaints are pretty much null!\n\nTLDR; Very funny and good, rant about it being easier than the first game, and new features being meh, still worth your time, buy it!","January 24, 2015","true","57.8"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","1"

The first game is shorter, lighter, and a good indicator of how you'll feel about the sequel. If you liked the first game, you'll also like the sequel. If you didn't like the first one because it didn't feel enough like a JRPG, you should try this one. If you simply didn't like the first game, you won't like this one either.\n\nI'm going to write this review as though you're familiar with the first game.\n\nQuick summary:\n- Much longer than the first game. Supports multiplayer with lobbies and Community Maps. Community Maps are awesome and could add a lot of replayability.\n- Very much a sequel to Half Minute Hero. It's a JRPG/Puzzle/Action hybrid that focuses on fun, but allows for challenge.\n- Only has RPG-mode, so Evil Lord/Princess/Knight fans are out of luck. RPG-mode fans are in for a huge treat.\n- Story is more of a take on epic SNES RPGs (e.g. Final Fantasy VI) than of classic NES RPGs (e.g. Dragon Quest).\n- Story mode less arcade-y. All the half-minute quests are in the framework of a traditional overworld RPG, although quests are individually replayable with leaderboards.\n- Lots of secret equipment/party members, as well as significant post story content. Maybe a 20-40 hour game, unless you really get into score attack or user levels.\n- Lots of extra modes, notably user generated levels and infinite play modes.\n- Music, graphics (retro 16 bit), and gameplay elements are all a big upgrade over the original.\n\nFrom all this, you can probably tell if you'd like the game or not. It's definitely not for everyone. I personally loved it. I'm arbitrarily giving it a score of 9, mostly because it's a niche game and I'd understand people who find it repetitive. I'll go into much more detail now.\n\n- GAMEPLAY -\n\nLike in the original, you take control of different main characters in different eras. Unlike the original, this game plays much more like a traditional JRPG. It is huge world with a lot of text and a lot of cutscenes. You explore an overworld map, fight battles, and progress the story. You equip yourself, you choose your party members, you choose your battle formations, you can switch classes, and you can look for secrets.\n\nHow does the overworld map work? You wander around and any leveling you do contributes to your "global level." Grinding this way is slow, but you do get unlimited dash. Grinding isn't necessary to beat the main game at all. As you explore, you run into areas that lock you into a subarea and start a Half Minute Quest. Your starting level is your global level and the quest plays out a lot like a quest from the original game, in which you have thirty seconds to defeat an Evil Lord before they destroy the world. Sometimes you have to trigger certain events, like finding a key or building a bridge, in order to find and defeat the boss. You can pay a money hungry goddess to reset your thirty second timer. When you finish the quest, the barriers and time limit go away and you reset to your global level. And you continue on like you were playing a traditional JRPG.\n\nThe basic game mechanics are almost exactly like the first game, except that you can see your enemies. If you're at a much a higher level than the enemy, you won't be forced into a battle screen when you touch them... you'll just automatically win. The quests are still very creative in this game and there are lots of new gimmicks (hope you don't mind solving ice puzzles or dealing with flipped controls in 30 seconds...) Some of the quests feel really epic. It's a lot of fun.\n\nIn addition to the five part story mode, there are four other modes to play.\n\nTime Attack: You can replay the quests you've unlocked from story mode. You can freely set your equipment, party, and formation to go for a high score.\nInfinite Mode: You fight an infinite number of evil lords. You go through different maps and have to kill ten evil lords that randomly spawn in the stage. After you beat ten, you move to a different stage and repeat until you can't restart the timer.\nMap Editor: Make/Share your own quests. This is pretty well done and not too hard to use. You can search for, download, and play other people's quests. Most of the highly ranked quests are really fun.\nBattle: Multiplayer mode, you compete with other people to defeat the evil lord first. There are eight different maps in this mode.\n\n- STORY -\n\nThe story is a lot richer and more serious this time around, but it still keeps its tongue-in-cheek tone. It is a continuation to the original Half Minute Hero story. There are actually a lot of callbacks to the first game. A surprising amount of familiar faces show up again as villians, heroes, or both. It's a good take on the huge RPGs of the SNES era. I enjoyed the story (especially from the second chapter onwards), but I could understand people thinking it's too slow or too cliche (even though it's cliche on purpose.)\n\nThe story mode follows three generations of heroes: Yuusha, Yushia, and Yuja. Yuusha is a play on the amnesiac, emo hero. He's even got one wing. He's captain of the royal forces on a special mission. Although he has a cold demeanor, he's a very caring guy. Yushia is a student of the Goddess school in a world ruled by the Empire. She's a bit naive and has to deal with a crazy escalating situation. Yuja is a brawn over brains kind of guy who's living in a post-apocalyptic type world that's been ruined by the gods. Each story mostly deals with saving the world within 30 seconds, but the overarching threat is different each time and each story has its own themes. Each of the heroes makes a contract with a Time Goddess who will reset time for them... for an increasingly high fee. Both main characters and supporting cast are pretty endearing.\n\nAs you can guess, this game addresses a lot of RPG tropes. You get lots of adventure, romance, betrayal, artifact collecting, and plot twists. There are evil empires, dark lords, time streams, and rivals to fight. You take on evil groups like the "Eight Elementals", "The Three Generals", the "Dark Time Goddess", and the "Venus Seven." The creators use a lot of cliches, but they use them knowingly. The story is clearly a take on character driven SNES-rpgs, especially Final Fantasy.\n\n- PRESENTATION -\n\nThe graphics follow the original Half Minute Hero's retro look, although this time around, the style is much closer to 16-bit RPGs of the SNES era. If you like that look, you'll love the art. There are a ton of sprites and a ton of maps. Most of the main characters and villians have concept art you can collect in game. The concepts were drawn by different artists and it's fun to compare the concept to the actual sprite.\n\nThe music is really great and done by a large group of great composers. There are vocal songs this time too, which add a really epic feel.\n\n- CLOSING -\n\nI'm a huge Half Minute Hero fan and grew up playing SNES RPGs, so I really loved this game. It's not just more of the same, I'd say the developers took even bigger risks this time by trying to make a full length game. It feels like a loving, fast paced take on a great traditional RPG.","April 7, 2014","true","51.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At first glance, it seemed to be just a parody : it mocked grindy RPG with cliche story. But once you delved into it you found a very original gameplay system, with lots of cool ideas. The maps were full of secrets and branching paths, and the combat system had some clever mechanics for people that wanted a challenge or wanted to find all secrets.\n\nThe Second Coming, by trying to add more stuff is now...a grindy RPG with cliche story. The super cliche plots are force fed to you through endless and pointless dialogs. The "metagame" added is a grindy RPG (not sped up) with linear plot, repetitive gameplay, forced backtracking to unlock all items, etc. Exactly the kind of games the first game was mocking.\n\nThe new combat features (Skills, formations, party, classes, etc...) are also completely broken. All attempts to use theses features will be constantly thwarted by the game, which reset your formations, party, equipment everytime a story event requires a single change (which is...almost always). "Luckily" you actually you do not have to use theses features most of the time, as brute forcing is often the way to go.\n\nUnfortunately, brute forcing can be applied to everything in the Second Coming. Most of the cleverness of the combat is gone : there are tons of items, but they don't have special attributes anymore like you could find in the first game. So you just get whatever give you the biggest stats bonus and rush. No need to be clever anymore, just go through the motions, endure the repetitive combats and you will win all missions. Even the secret titles, which used to be a challenge in the first game, are now rather straightforward and super easy to get.\n\nOn the bright side, for people who are looking for a challenge, there is a very challenging "endless" mode, but i doubt you will come back to it once you've finished it, since the maps are always the same.\n\nMultiplayer has also been upgraded, but since there are very few players, I've been unable to try it, which will be the case for you too if you don't have friends who own the game.\n\nOn the whole, I don't see enough good stuff in this game to alievate the bad, and I can only advise you to stick to the first game. I completed the game, but it wasnt because i enjoyed it, it was only for completion sake and to be sure i wasn't missing something....","October 14, 2014","false","34.3"," 48 of 94 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","48","94","2","1"

Actually anywhere from 2 to 5 minutes in practice but it still has the "Wario Ware roleplaying game" feel about it.\n\nWhat's kind of interesting and ambitious is that the nature of the parody is naturally running a little dry, so the game doesn't sell itself strictly on its core gimmick anymore. That was a very smart move on the developer's part, in my opinion. It doesn't strictly feel like a series of action levels emulating an RPG this time around. This game is actually a true RPG as well. You explore, grind on enemies, search for collectables, all that good stuff. Just that the original game's arcadey gameplay is the meat of the story segments and are replayable in much the same way (with the ability to turn off the advantage the RPG-side of the game offers). The story is a bit more substantial and the characters have a more coherent and central role, with the ability to set your own party and no restrictions on equipment. It's not quite as *overtly* silly as the original game, it takes itself a bit more seriously -- but not by a whole lot. A defining silly moment for me is when one of the protagonists goes inside a virtual boy game and inside the game you have to use a controller to clear a path. Trippy.\n\nThere aren't other gameplay modes besides the standard this time, but those were kinda weak additions to the original game in the first place. Instead you play through different protagonists across time and each story has a distinctly different tone or feel, ranging from deadly serious to a lighthearted Chrono Trigger-style affair. The best part to me has to be the expanded multiplayer functions  -- you can play any of the protagonists! -- and the ability to make your story maps. Being able to share through the steam workshop is a plus too. The interface is a lot better and it's a much more natural PC port than the original and doesn't suffer the same shortcomings i.e. the lag, bugs and cut features.\n\nIt's a great sequel and consider it strongly recommended if you enjoy the original. The story has a lot of continuity and connection to the original, a really surprising degree. I'd recommend trying out the original game to really feel some of that impact, but it's far from required to enjoy the whole thing.","April 11, 2014","true","48.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dart572/recommended/240970/","dart572","Carmello the Chocolate Paladin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dart572/","44 products in account","This game is a worthy successor to the first game, which you get for free when buying this, so that's a hell of a deal right there. While the first game felt a bit more of a parody of the whole JRPG genre, this one feels more like they're playing it straight, while at the same time keeping their very unique and quirky style. While this game doesn't seem to feature extra modes like Evil Lord 30, Princess 30, or Knight 30, it does expand greatly upon the Hero 30; play an entire JRPG adventure in 30 seconds style, adding things like weapon crafting, global dungeons, a traversable map, collectibles and a pretty sweet castle. This game isn't quite as out there as the first, but it also feels better from a gameplay perspective, now when you go back to get certain titles or equipment, you may do so with your full party and equipment from where you are in the currently, not being restricted to items that you had on your first pass of the level.\n\nThese games have always felt more like puzzle games to me rather than JRPGs, you have to figure out how to level up, manage your money, and do it all within a certain time limit. The game gets very intense in later levels, and has an absolutely fantastic soundtrack that makes the best parts of this game shine even brighter. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of JRPGs or anime, or anyone who like speed-running games. There are other modes to speak of, but I haven't played the Multiplayer yet, though the Infinite Hero mode was really fun, you basically just keep leveling up and fighting one Evil Lord after another, trying to set a high score, changing levels every 10 bosses you defeat.\n\nHonestly this game is a really fun game to just pick up and play, its levels take probably 1-5 minutes, with the longer ones being probably at least 10-15 minutes, but there are a lot of levels, and it feels good to binge play or to just do 3-4 levels at a time. The levels consist of you sprinting around a map, fighting enemies, helping people, leveling up, and trying to defeat some sort of enemy in 30 seconds, on the normal setting, time is paused in towns, and you can reset time by paying a certain amount of money to a goddess statue in town, the fee gets greater and greater each time. The story can be a bit bland/jrpg-ish when it's not being funny or having completely badass moments. The characters are likable, even if Yusha is kind of that emo jrpg protag, he's still cool, and he's only really bad if you choose to make him be bad. I highly recommend playing the first game before you play this one, there are lots and lots of references to the first game, and you would probably be missing something if you just jumped right into the second one, which should kind of be obvious, but don't worry, as I said, you get the first game free with the purchase of this one. I'm just gonna stop my disjointed ramblings now and say: It's a good game, full of good humor, fun characters, and a great OST, which also comes bundled with the game.","March 8, 2015","true","44.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

How can i put this down? Let's see... Take the character development, the RPG style and the feels of the Final Fantasy golden era, and a ground-breaking game concept such as the 1st Half Minute Hero game. Give them some wine, some private space, you know what i'm talking about. Wait for 30 seconds and you get this game. This game just feels like it knows what it is, and does what it should do amazingly. The first game did it nicely, but... there was something missing. The RPG feel was kinda lacking, the character development was not done to maximum potential, and the gameplay just felt a bit too linear. It was basically a concept with an insane amount of potential. Now, don't take me wrong. i played the game, i liked it. But this game managed to squeeze every ounce of potential off of the concept, and did it in the best way possible. The sheer amounts of content in this game are impressive. Multiplayer, Level Editor, Steam Workshop support, infinite mode, time attack And almost 30 hours of main storyline. The soundtrack is possibly one of the most well composed ones out there, boosting the game feel by a lot. None of the characters in this game are stand-off or flat in any way, but the game doesn't slap your face with their attitudes, and are just dang fun to play with. The storyline's fairly simple to understand, but complex enough to keep you interested into what's going to happen. As i already said, this game knows what it wants to be, and does it in the best way possible. The feeling of the game is silly in an enjoyable way, but this can change to best fit certain parts of the game (such as when Coo dies in the 4th chapter, so sad ;_;). In my opinion, though, the best improvement from the previous game is how they handled the Overworld outside of quests. In the first one, the overworld was almost not there. It was a level select, pretty much. But in this one, you could walk around, raid Dungeons outside of quests, visit villages without the 30 seconds limit, buy gear that you couldn't afford during quests, and just generally have a good time. Then again, this game's 10€ (11, including the DLC containing perhaps the best DLC section ever made, check some of my screenshots out for more information).  AND by paying 10€, you even get the first game! That's even more content for such a low price! In total, the first and the second are gonna be roughly 50-55 hours of Gameplay. So yeah, if you have some spare money on your wallet and still don't have this game, this is definitely the way to go if you like RPGs and fun games.","March 13, 2015","true","30.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

All of the characters are flat, 1 dimensional and uninspired (which would not have been a problem in the original).\n\nThe parody, jokes and 4th wall humour are much less and almost absent, making this game feel really empty compared to the first one.\n\nI tried to like this game but just couldn't. Instead, I highly reccomend playing Half Minute Hero 1 if you have not played it already. For any returning players, you may be disappointed.\n","September 6, 2015","false","4.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

This is coming from someone who loved the first half min hero.\n\n(This is worth buying due to having the first game also when you buy this)\n\nUnlike the first game that was semi serious (in a sense) and had hits of RPG of parody, this game is almost a damn parody in itself where the humor is literal nonexistent and cringe worthy after the constant jokes it tries to convey.\n\nThe thing that the first half min hero did well was keeping the gameplay fresh, with 4 different stories in it with all different types of gameplay. However, in this game you are force to do 75 levels of the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over again, where it becomes boring and dull.\n\nThis game also has a open world system where your only task is to GRIND, and that’s it.\n\nI still enjoyed it up into the half way point but the game should've ended a lot earlier than it did. If you like JRPG grinding then you’ll love this game.

You spend most of the game doing quests that usually give you a 30 second time limit to complete them. It's hard to impossible to actually complete any quest in that amount of time however, so there are almost always Goddess Statues to reset the timer for a small amount of gold. Each of the 80 or so quests pretty much boils down to going to a town to find out how to solve the gimmick blocking access to the boss, solving the gimmick, then going to beat the boss... resetting the timer whenever necessary. Thankfully, a surprisingly engaging hilarious story and the occasional quest that mixes things up keeps the formula from becoming too grating.\n\nThe biggest difference between this game and the first is the world map. Instead of simply picking a quest, you actually explore with your team in true RPG fashion. You can even level up, collect gold to spend on items you may have missed during quests, and go into some dungeons free of a time limit. Best of all, your level will carry over to the quests you play, lessening the amount of grinding necessary to complete each one. Another great thing is that you can use any gear in any quest after you obtain it. The first game locked gear away making it all feel kind of pointless, but in this one, if you want to take your ultimate gear to the first quest and wreck the boss in one hit, feel free!\n\nThere's really not much more to say. This baby is well worth the asking price, especially since it comes with the first game AND the entire soundtrack (which has some damn great tunes in it).","December 27, 2014","true","44.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's a lot of fun.\nFor those who haven't played the first and don't know what to expect, this game isn't exactly what you'd expect just by hearing about it and looking at it.\nThe first game is less of a "rapid RPG" or speedrun-esque thing and more of a large series of puzzles. This is true as well in the sequel, although in the later stretches of the game, you will definitely feel more of an action RPG vibe.\n\nYou can mash through any level simply by grinding hard enough on the overworld, but a true challenge presents itself when you refuse to grind, and push onward using your wits.\n\nIt's a nice timesink, and incredibly worth your money, considering you get this game, a kickass OST, and the (admittedly poorly handled) port of the first game.\n\nI've not done the multiplayer or messed with the level creation tools all that much, but in my honest opinion, that stuff really isn't why you buy the game.","December 18, 2014","true","45.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Ruarrrrrr Biasa! (Review ini bakal direvisi terus)\n\nFeel Fast Paced RPG-nya dapet banget, dimana kita jadi Hero yang sama yang ngelanjutin cerita Half Minute Hero sebelumnya. Jujur gw belom nyobain yang pertama dan cuma nonton di Youtube. Game ini masih soal nyelamatin dunia dari semua Evil Demons yang muncul dan menghancurkan dunia dalam waktu 30 Detik saja. Gameplaynya yang menarik juga disuguhi dengan background music yang luar biasa bikin deg-deg-ser. Main Storynya kita bakal mainin sampai 500 tahun cerita dan bakal banyak dialog juga di game ini dan hati-hati dengan tombol enter, bakal skip dialognya dan bener-bener cepet banget.\n\nSalah satu hal menariknya adanya dukungan Oculust Rift dan Map Editor, bukan cuma Multiplayer Battle yang selalu bikin rame game ini tapi juga bisa share Map bikinan kita sendiri di steam workshop. Terus selain Multiplayer Battle, ada juga Infinite Battle dan Time Attack Battle yang bisa nyombongin hasilnya ke Leaderboards secara global.\nNgomongin soal Multiplayer, jangan tanya soal serunya, pasti seru! kalian bisa cepet-cepetan ngalahin Evil Demons ataupun Co-op. Yang nyesek sekaligus bikin seru ya siapa yang terakhir nge-kill dia dinobatin sebagai HERO! tapi, titlenya bisa aja jadi Fake Hero.\n\nHarganya $19,99? Bisa dibilang mahal tapi worth to buy. Karena emang dahsyat dan banyak fiturnya. 90/100 dari gw untuk saat ini.","April 4, 2014","true","5.9"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

They took everything about the first game's retro RPG style and turned it completely weeaboo... In a game that's supposed to be fast paced and right down to action, there's TOO much dialog for a game called Half Minute Hero... some of the dialog in the first area alone can take up to 5 minutes to sit through and read. This is just unacceptable on every level. I literally pressed start to skip past the dialog and skipping past some of the dialog would take upwards of 10 full seconds... I'm here to play a faced paced game, not read a novel.\n\nThis game is more grindy than the first, there's a lot more back and forth running between areas, the enemies are much tougher than they were in the first game  as well which is exactly why the game is more of a grind out. I hate the characters, they're all weeaboos, the menu is too weeaboo as well with convoluted ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t vomited bile and the art style is really bunk.\n\nIn this installment instead of controlling a single character you have an entire posse watching your back, except you can't equip them with gear so I mean, what's the point of having a party if you can't manage them? Aren't these weeaboo games supposed to be all about sifting through menus and upgrading characters for 20 minutes before moving 10 feet and having to reconfigure again?\n\nThey even tried to implement the feel of those style of games by letting you walk around on the over world map and gain another set of levels separate from the levels you gain inside of a stage... sounds ridiculous? It is. This game hardly makes sense, not that I don't understand it, it's just incredibly convoluted for no apparent reason other than to be a schizophrenic disaster like most weeb games are... like just keep it simple... why all this noise and distraction every time I want to move forward?\n\nIf you're a weeb, this is probably right up your autistic alleyway. For normal RPG lovers and gamers who enjoyed the first game, because it reminded them of old school pixel games like Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, (Which again is weeb, just not to the Nth degree that it's become now with dudes that other dudes would like to bang because they look like chicks) then steer very clear of it... I got sick of the pacing after 40 minutes and uninstalled it. 4 / 10.\n\nFirst one did it better.","June 13, 2015","false","2.5"," 6 of 29 people (21%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","21","6","29","5","0"

I say they are ridiculous because none of them seem to affect the gameplay in any substantial way whatsoever. The gameplay is still running around the map quickly and knowing what your objectives are.\n\nI think if you have mediocre taste due to watching bad anime, and you are desperate for any JRPG, you will enjoy this.

That being said, it's constantly interrupted by the 'story.' At first, it seems to parody the generic save-the-world jRPG formula, but nearing the end it feels like they genuinely wanted a serious story and just couldn't decide so they went half-way on both.\n\nThe quests take about 30 seconds to 2 minutes to complete, which gives the game a nice fast-paced feel. But, again, there's at least 2 minutes of pre-quest talk, and another 2-5 after it ends.

Those aren't available. However! This game has an actual interesting story, which is something I really didn't expect from a game that got so little praise. Is there a reason not a lot of people talk about this game? WHO KNOWS!?\n\nIt's got a world map which you're free to explore and increase your "gLevel" which is basically your starting level at the beginning of an actual quest. There's no time limit, and story points are very clear because there's literally a cursor pointing at the spot you go to advance the plot. It's great!\n\nMultiple storylines covering 500 years? AWWWWRIGHT!\n\nGreat music? INDEED SO!\n\nClasses, parties, formations for those parties, actual equipment that matters that's also upgradeable!? SUMMON STONES!? THE HYPE INTENSIFIES.\n\nThere's also a map editor for nerds that like that stuff.\n\nAnd an endless mode where you rush from Evil Lord to Evil Lord. Endlessly. I got 67 on normal mode. 6 on Hard.\n\nI will add more to this totally non-bias review once I finish all the campaigns and unlock all the achievements.\n\n\n\nOverall: 9/10\n-1 point for lack of modes other than hit stuff and level up.\nBut the world map sure makes up for lack of modes.","January 9, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The half minute hero format is interesting, though! You have 30 seconds to defeat whatever evil force is threatening to destroy the world/continent/whatever. Point is, you have 30 seconds! Oh no! That's not NEARLY enough time! Well luckily you have "The power of the goddess" on your side! Essentially you grind for 29 seconds, run to town, and pay N*100 gold to reset the clock, where N=1. This means the first reset is 100g, the 2nd 200 and so on. The challenge shifts from simply grinding until you're sufficiently leveled (the game literally tells you "You>Evil!" to say you're leveled enough) to managing your resets efficiently.\nI remember a mission, mission 3 or 4, where all of the good grinding mobs were a good deal further in the level. You will not always succeed the first time through, you need to know all the parameters to the challenge before you can farm and grind effectively.\n\nAfter you defeat a boss, you usually get put back in the open world, where your level and gold revert to a sort of macro profile. You had 10000 gold and 30 levels in the challenge? Tough, you're back to your global level and gold. The good news is the next time you start a new mission, you start at your global level, so a little in-between mission grinding goes a long way. Also in between missions is my preferred time to buy gear, because there are serious penalties if you can't afford a reset during a mission.\n\nI just got explained some sort of skill system. It sounds like it boils down to grinding a certain weapon to unlock sweet super moves. None of which you can pick, combat is entirely automated all the time. Hell, if you're too overpowered, you dont even get a battle screen, you just run over the enemy and it flies off the map, team rocket style.\n\nThe writing is bleh, thank goodness you can skip it with a simple press of the start button. The goddess is this annoying money-♥♥♥♥♥ who loves getting gold, so while she's essential to saving the world, she's also a stupidly annoying character. Your hero is some generic angsty dude, I dont really know what his deal is. It's not very engaging.\n\nOverall, I suggest this game to anyone who likes JRPGs and something new. I'd pay 10, maybe 15 bucks for this game.","July 5, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To be Honest I was alright with the other modes in the original but my favorite by far was Hero 30. this game pretty much focuses on that alone as far as the main story is concerned. The original style of combat is still there with two added bonuses, players can learn special moves and equipt for in battle as well as any special move attached to the weapon being used. players can also level up outside of battle and earn money to catch a few items they may have missed during a quest. In turn you don't always have to replay a level to get items you may have missed. Global dungeons are cool too. They add a little extra to the play with more enemies and loot. overall it's a solid game.","July 12, 2014","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you liked the original HMH, you'll like this. Just make sure to turn off skill animations. Trust me >_>\n\nUnfortunately, this port leaves unchanged what I felt was one of the greatest flaws of the PSP version, which is that the time trial mode doesn't limit equipment you can use in any meaningful fashion. This makes the mode extremely boring (having OP equipment makes most stages complete jokes), which is a shame; trying to get better and better times on each stage is what made the first game awesome.\n\nFurthermore, the translation is... questionable at best. Much of the original characters' charm is gone (for instance, there's a character whose entire shtick is that she tries to act dignified, winds up getting angered by something, and then tries to switch back to formal speech as if nothing had happened; in the translation, she never acts dignified, barely sounds like she's getting mad, and then says "Yes, I would." Yes, I would have liked her to be localized better); literally translated names make puns unintelligible ("Yuusha" literally means "hero"... Why leave this untranslated? And there's one character whose name is a shortened version of his name in the previous game, but the names in the translation are completely different!); and "Ojisama" was translated as "Geezer," which makes me cry.\n\nI realize I've been mostly negative, so let me say again: the core gameplay is still solid. If you treat it as a JPRG with a time-limit twist, you'll be in love. But after how superb the localization of the first game was, and how addicting and satisfying it was to solve the puzzles that were the individual level runs in the original, it's a shame to see the ball dropped so... thoroughly.","April 4, 2014","true","165.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Other times they hardly change the formula and are just an updated version. Others blow the original right out of the water and make you remember them more than anything else (example: Assassins Creed 2)\n\nI feel that Half Minute Hero 2 does just that. Adding more to do than just the story missions, easier ways to replay levels, and giving players a way to get a leg up in the next missions, rewarding them in a way for playing and exploring the world for the hidden goodies. Oh and that you don't have to replay a mission to go BUY stuff you missed is nice.\n\nThough this time the story is clearly the important part, which is more than fine by me. I just wish it was a bit more self aware than it is, more like HMH1, but that said, I DO love the world, characters and story enough so it doesn't bother me too much.\n\nSo if you wanted a bit more meat than what Half Minute Hero One did, Half Minute Hero Two gives you a steak instead of BBQ Ribs.\n\n10/10 would pay goddess gold to reset time again... and again... and again!","December 28, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here is your chance\n\nThe first Half Minute Hero was ingenious puzzle game where the goal was to complete different kind of areas under 30 second. If the 30 second goal was failed, then time could be rewinded for ever increasing pay. The first game also featured some jrpg elements like new equipment (which couldn't be brought to earlier levels).\n\nHalf Minute Hero: The Second Coming takes the mechanics of the first game and jrpgfies them and adds some completely new mechanics. Some of the changes are global level ups and removal of equipment restrictions. This results the game being considerably easier than the first game and time of the levels doesn't really matter anymore. There is time attack mode, but unfortunately it suffers also from the same global character syndrome.\n\nHowever, what is achieved with those changes is that the Half Minute Hero: The Second Coming is a genuine rpg and a very good one. Admitted, the script is written without much thought, but half asessed parody of more popular rpg branches goes well with this game. Half Minute Hero SC knows what it is capable and doesn't try to be anything else than light-jrpg...\n\nWell that is besides the music, for some reason the soundtrack of the game is really over the top and features songs/compositions from 24 different artists. This includes multiple Final Fantasy composers and Chrono Trigger composer. And if you think those were the only ones worth mentioning, you are very wrong (the list just would be too long). Soundtrack of the Half Minute Hero SC doesn't pale in comparison to any other game-soundtrack. It isn't long, but it is compact and packs a huge punch and enhances the game massively! What is best about the soundtrack is how it is used. There are moments in the game where the soundtrack is utilized near utmost perfection. For example final mission of Ragnarok story arc and its vocal track was something from which those big and old franchises could learn. I think have have never stared battle result screen as long as I did after that mission, for it featured instrumental version of that same song (a thing, nothing short of brilliant).","February 19","true","44.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It will create the most beautiful and awesome game made in anime heaven.\nFor most people this would seem like a turn-off from the first game since it would take nearly everything from the story, art and a bit of the soundtrack out of the window. They would expect another same looking JRPG with a bit more fleshed out story and gameplay than the first one, but instead they got a massive RPGmaker looking game coated in anime weaboo sparkles.\n\nAm I the only one who was actually ok with this? Yea? Ok then.\n\n\nWeaboo Review:\n\nFor me, the story was AMAZING. It literally was a massive throwback to all my favorite action animes, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam, Code Geass, etc. It was complete with some 4th wall breaking jokes and the ending battle cliche where the protag remembers his fallen friends and the protag's journey to fight his own fate/destiny. There was a LOT of reading to be done in this game though. It's almost like a VN.\n\n-Story- Game w/ weaboo glasses:       10000/10\n\nReal Review:\n\nStory w/out weaboo glasses:  5/10\n\nNow, taking the weaboo glasses off, the story was almost bland to the extent of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ people off. The characters didn't seem to have that much depth. The first protag guy who seemed to be the stereotypical Kirito, who at first seemed really normal-ish but then got kicked in the nuts by reality and now turns into a overreactional emo b*tch. The other protag characters were also stereotypical, the girl protag who raises your hopes of being more fleshed out than the other ones but turned out to be another determined stereotypical Asuna (who cries alot). The third one was simply... Naruto. Just.. Naruto. There's literally no other way I can express him.\n\n\nThe gameplay was basically the same as the first one except they threw out all of the cleveressness and the parody-ish style of the first one where they mocked the all the grinding in JRPG games and instead replaced it with just.. Grinding. Like, grinding for ?? f*cking minutes to get to  lvl ????? You can literally brute force your way to any situation. It literally goes like this.\n\nGet Objective ---> Grind ---> ???? ---> Profit\n\nI myself didn't really fell the grind while playing this game because the dialouge usually kept things fresh with a small joke or some 4th wall breaking. They also added a bit of a mech thing gameplay that I don't really get. It didn't actually change anything from the original fast-paced grinding of the first one but.. it was simply a thing. That was there. o.O\n\nGameplay: 6/10\n\nThe art? Ehh, the first one was better.\nThe first one gave it a standard-ish RPG looking game that you would normally find on other online flash games like Kongregate, etc. which you don't usually find in other JRPG games and gave it a really unique and memorable feel to the game. The second one just seems like another one of those... RPG maker types of games. >.>\n\nArt: 6/10 (Why is it not 5? Because of the PLOT.)\n\nSoundtrack? Umm.. It was okay I guess...?\nIt didn't really stand out much apart from the boss scenes when you're rewarded with rock music blaring from your speakers that would make any rock fan proud. The music at times gets cut off by battles with monsters and after you complete them it starts back from the start. So you can't really enjoy the soundtrack unless you literally just put your controller down and listen.\n\nAin't nobody got time for dat.\n\nSo yeah.. 6/10 for the soundtrack.\n\n\nAnd right now, I could just guess what you're thinking, 'With all these horrible scores why would you recommend this game?' Because I can't. I really can't not (double negatives woo) recommend this game. My inner weaboo keeps my hand from clicking the No in the recommendation bar. So to anyone who is still reading don't buy this game if you CAN'T STAND action cliche's or just anime in general.","January 3","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, kinda, but that also makes it so you have to think ahead, calculating the time that it will possibly take to finish the battle, and yes, you don't want to lose time, since the world will blow up, and that hurts a little.\n\nThis game also includes the first one and the soundtrack, so go and grab it!","June 5, 2015","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first, I was a little annoyed that some of the features in the first one, like the graphics modes and different modes weren't included but then I realized the story mode in this one is actually much more complete.  It really surprised me.","June 29, 2015","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HeyImACustomURL/recommended/240970/","HeyImACustomURL","MystRaven567","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HeyImACustomURL/","39 products in account","This game should be renamed Half Minute Hero: The Anime\n\n\nNo really, I'm serious.\n\nFirst take the really good gameplay of the first half minute hero and then smash it at all the cliches from all action anime that you have ever seen in your life. It will create the most beautiful and awesome game made in anime heaven.\nFor most people this would seem like a turn-off from the first game since it would take nearly everything from the story, art and a bit of the soundtrack out of the window. They would expect another same looking JRPG with a bit more fleshed out story and gameplay than the first one, but instead they got a massive RPGmaker looking game coated in anime weaboo sparkles.\n\nAm I the only one who was actually ok with this? Yea? Ok then.\n\n\nWeaboo Review:\n\nFor me, the story was AMAZING. It literally was a massive throwback to all my favorite action animes, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam, Code Geass, etc. It was complete with some 4th wall breaking jokes and the ending battle cliche where the protag remembers his fallen friends and the protag's journey to fight his own fate/destiny. There was a LOT of reading to be done in this game though. It's almost like a VN.\n\n-Story- Game w/ weaboo glasses:       10000/10\n\nReal Review:\n\nStory w/out weaboo glasses:  5/10\n\nNow, taking the weaboo glasses off, the story was almost bland to the extent of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ people off. The characters didn't seem to have that much depth. The first protag guy who seemed to be the stereotypical Kirito, who at first seemed really normal-ish but then got kicked in the nuts by reality and now turns into a overreactional emo b*tch. The other protag characters were also stereotypical, the girl protag who raises your hopes of being more fleshed out than the other ones but turned out to be another determined stereotypical Asuna (who cries alot). The third one was simply... Naruto. Just.. Naruto. There's literally no other way I can express him.\n\n\nThe gameplay was basically the same as the first one except they threw out all of the cleveressness and the parody-ish style of the first one where they mocked the all the grinding in JRPG games and instead replaced it with just.. Grinding. Like, grinding for ?? f*cking minutes to get to  lvl ????? You can literally brute force your way to any situation. It literally goes like this.\n\nGet Objective ---> Grind ---> ???? ---> Profit\n\nI myself didn't really fell the grind while playing this game because the dialouge usually kept things fresh with a small joke or some 4th wall breaking. They also added a bit of a mech thing gameplay that I don't really get. It didn't actually change anything from the original fast-paced grinding of the first one but.. it was simply a thing. That was there. o.O\n\nGameplay: 6/10\n\nThe art? Ehh, the first one was better.\nThe first one gave it a standard-ish RPG looking game that you would normally find on other online flash games like Kongregate, etc. which you don't usually find in other JRPG games and gave it a really unique and memorable feel to the game. The second one just seems like another one of those... RPG maker types of games. >.>\n\nArt: 6/10 (Why is it not 5? Because of the PLOT.)\n\nSoundtrack? Umm.. It was okay I guess...?\nIt didn't really stand out much apart from the boss scenes when you're rewarded with rock music blaring from your speakers that would make any rock fan proud. The music at times gets cut off by battles with monsters and after you complete them it starts back from the start. So you can't really enjoy the soundtrack unless you literally just put your controller down and listen.\n\nAin't nobody got time for dat.\n\nSo yeah.. 6/10 for the soundtrack.\n\n\nAnd right now, I could just guess what you're thinking, 'With all these horrible scores why would you recommend this game?' Because I can't. I really can't not (double negatives woo) recommend this game. My inner weaboo keeps my hand from clicking the No in the recommendation bar. So to anyone who is still reading don't buy this game if you CAN'T STAND action cliche's or just anime in general.","January 3","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Other times they hardly change the formula and are just an updated version. Others blow the original right out of the water and make you remember them more than anything else (example: Assassins Creed 2)\n\nI feel that Half Minute Hero 2 does just that. Adding more to do than just the story missions, easier ways to replay levels, and giving players a way to get a leg up in the next missions, rewarding them in a way for playing and exploring the world for the hidden goodies. Oh and that you don't have to replay a mission to go BUY stuff you missed is nice.\n\nThough this time the story is clearly the important part, which is more than fine by me. I just wish it was a bit more self aware than it is, more like HMH1, but that said, I DO love the world, characters and story enough so it doesn't bother me too much.\n\nSo if you wanted a bit more meat than what Half Minute Hero One did, Half Minute Hero Two gives you a steak instead of BBQ Ribs.\n\n10/10 would pay goddess gold to reset time again... and again... and again!","December 28, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here is your chance\n\nThe first Half Minute Hero was ingenious puzzle game where the goal was to complete different kind of areas under 30 second. If the 30 second goal was failed, then time could be rewinded for ever increasing pay. The first game also featured some jrpg elements like new equipment (which couldn't be brought to earlier levels).\n\nHalf Minute Hero: The Second Coming takes the mechanics of the first game and jrpgfies them and adds some completely new mechanics. Some of the changes are global level ups and removal of equipment restrictions. This results the game being considerably easier than the first game and time of the levels doesn't really matter anymore. There is time attack mode, but unfortunately it suffers also from the same global character syndrome.\n\nHowever, what is achieved with those changes is that the Half Minute Hero: The Second Coming is a genuine rpg and a very good one. Admitted, the script is written without much thought, but half asessed parody of more popular rpg branches goes well with this game. Half Minute Hero SC knows what it is capable and doesn't try to be anything else than light-jrpg...\n\nWell that is besides the music, for some reason the soundtrack of the game is really over the top and features songs/compositions from 24 different artists. This includes multiple Final Fantasy composers and Chrono Trigger composer. And if you think those were the only ones worth mentioning, you are very wrong (the list just would be too long). Soundtrack of the Half Minute Hero SC doesn't pale in comparison to any other game-soundtrack. It isn't long, but it is compact and packs a huge punch and enhances the game massively! What is best about the soundtrack is how it is used. There are moments in the game where the soundtrack is utilized near utmost perfection. For example final mission of Ragnarok story arc and its vocal track was something from which those big and old franchises could learn. I think have have never stared battle result screen as long as I did after that mission, for it featured instrumental version of that same song (a thing, nothing short of brilliant).","February 19","true","44.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On a bit of a more serious note, if you enjoy RPGs, and enjoy a bit of slap-stick humor with an over the top story that makes friendly jabs at the genre's tropes then this is the game for you. However if you're a gamer that primarily plays AAA games with top of the line graphics with a disdain towards JRPGS and pixel styled graphics then this game is definitely not for you. Although on a final note I would recommend a buy as I think The Second Coming has something for everyone within in if you're willing to take the time to appreciate it's subtle nuances.
