A Weapon Shop?! is a casual management game from Daylight Studios. Your Grandfather has sadly passed away and he has left you his 0.01% stake in his blacksmith business, you feel you have no choice but to carry on his work and with the help of Agent 46 you try to create the most successful blacksmithing business the world has ever seen! Manage the shop, research new weapons, train up and coming blacksmiths, craft weapons for the World's heroes and so much more, all with the repeated click of a button (you have to do a lot of clicking).\n\nBefore I get underway I'd briefly like to mention my first impressions of the game. For the first half an hour or so I really did not like this game at all, it was a tutorial section so nothing was really unlocked yet and it just felt so tedious, click here, click there, make money etc. Thankfully, once more stuff became unlocked, I began to enjoy the game more, to the point where I played it for 4 hours straight. Sadly the game receeds into tedium later on, but more on that later.\n\n+Charming art style\n+Good writing and loads of amusing references to other games, movies and music\n+A huge number of weapons, of many different types, to research and craft\n+Occasionally random events will occur (such as a potato is struggling to cut a sapling down. Help him?) which provide a somewhat interesting break from the main game though this do begin to get repetitive rather quickly\n+Most things, from your name to the name's of your weapons, can be named which can be rather amusing if you're good at coming up with funny names\n+Nice, relaxing music, which fits well with the game\n+The game gives you objectives to complete which helps guide you through the game\n+You can upgrade your shop with cosmetic items such as carpets, wallpapers, dog houses etc\n\n+/-The game's UI makes it feel like a mobile game, despite the fact that it's not, probably due to the dev studio mainly working on mobile games. Personally, I don't really mind this but I know it may bother some people\n\n-There's next to no gameplay depth, all it is is researching weapons, followed by sending someone to buy supplies, followed by telling your blacksmiths to craft the weapon and you have to do this again and again and again and again\n-For a good few hours the game is pretty interesting, the objectives are still pretty small so they don't take long to complete hence the game flows quickly but once you get into the later stages of the game selling three weapons (the most you can do in one go) only pushes the objective up by around 3% which means you have to grind out the same weapons over and over again which gets incredibly boring (this is the very reason I stopped playing the game)\n-Some of the dialogue between your character and Agent 46 is repeated several times which I thought was pretty lazy\n-So. Much. Clicking. I've never gotten into any of the clicker games so having to click so much in this game was rather irritating\n-No graphical options, no control options and only very basic audio options\n\nVerdict:\nWorth Purchasing on Sale (6.5/10)\n\nHoly Potatoes! is a fun, casual management game, with a charming art style and funny references, for a time before quickly descending into tedium. Even fans of management games will find this game quickly gets repetitive so only buy it if you see it on sale or you really can't help yourself.\n\nReview copy provided.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","July 19, 2015","true","13.9"," 228 of 266 people (86%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","86","228","266","11","7"

A Weapon Shop?! is a game about running a weapons store/blacksmith in an RPG universe filled with...Potatoes\n\nThe world seems cute, loaded with potato puns along with simple yet good graphics, but with only a few things to do in it no amount of looking pretty and cute dialogue is going to redeem the fact that in its essence it's a waiting game.\n\nThat's right, there's no real simulation or management here(Thanks steam tags!), with you just sending your potatoes out to do things and then waiting for them to come back. Or alternatively, telling them to make a weapon and then waiting for them to finish. The large part of this game is waiting for things to be done so that you can tell them to do more things...And then you wait some more.\nThis may be fine and well for a timewaster game on an iphone, but it just does not cut it for an actual PC game. You sit and wait for your potatoes to be done and you are occasionally thrown a random event which is a reference to an older game with two options which can both be a success (Minor, barely noticable effect on a single potatosmith), or a bad event which will give you a slight bad effect on a single potatosmith. In the end, you can just skip most of them and you wouldn't lose out on anything. It relies purely on it's 'humour' of gaming references and potato puns to be interesting, which does not make for a good game.\n\nThere is simply no gameplay to be had. No real managing your store, or figuring out what to do best, just telling your spuds to go do stuff and then waiting for them to do it. I would say it is closer to an interactive screensaver with pretense of being a game than it is to actually being a game - Sad too, as I was hoping to find a good management game\n\nWith a price of 15 euro, I would say it is severely overpricing itself. If it were in an app store, for maybe 5 euro/dollar I could see it succeed, but at this price and on a PC it has no chance at all. If you are still curious about it, pick it up at a sale, but don't bother with it full price unless you are a very patient person, and you do not mind not having anything to do.","July 13, 2015","false","1.7"," 537 of 714 people (75%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","75","537","714","15","32"

A Weapon Shop?!\nHoly Potatoes! A Weapon Shop?! is an amazingly fun simulation and management game where you craft weapons for heroes. The game is full of numerous references to games, movies, and literature.  I will add a TL;DR at the end.\n\nGameplay\nYou are the grandson of the great blacksmith Batata and you are informed by Agent 46 that he has passed away. Agent 46 informs you that you now own 0.01% of the shop while he own 99.99% of the shop. You start off with 3 different smiths to help you out. Each smith you can hire is essentially a parody of one character or another. Hulk Hogan becomes Bulk Bogan and so on. Throughout the game you craft an enormous amount of different weapons for heroes. There are legendary heroes and smiths who most people will recognize. There are 4 main stats that your weapons will use which include Magic, Speed, Accuracy, and Attack. The smiths have expansions into classes which improve their stats at improving certain aspects of a weapon.  There are different regions to sell in and different heroes who will buy your weapons. The storyline is enjoyable and there are random events where you have to make a choice which will reward you or punish you. You can send your smiths to sell, shop, explore, train, and vacation. This is a game that will slowly make you want to play more and more with its interesting features.\n\nGraphics/Sound\nThe graphics in the game are polished and smooth (you know for a potato). Each character resembles a potato while also having different unique features. The character design is uniquely potato-like and the little customization options are nice. The music adds to the enjoyment and relaxation in this game. The character sounds are cute to say the least.\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ Dozens references to movies, literature, and games\n+ Dozens of weapons to forge\n+ Class Tree\n+ Simple yet enjoyable storyline\n+ Batato (Batman is a potato)\n+ Mood system and dog helping mood\n+ Artwork\n+ Legendary Heroes and Smiths\n+ Can spend hours playing this game\n\nCons\n\n- Can get repetitive\n- Bit slow at first\n- Not that much customization\n- Can only send 3 smiths at once to one location at a time\n\nSuggestions\nThese are my personal suggestions for the game. My suggestions do not need to be taken seriously as they are my personal opinion for hopefully adding to the game to make it more enjoyable.\n\n- When doing a request with a certain prefix have some way of checking the request while selecting the prefix to make sure you get it right\n- More customization for the shop\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI am happy to have been able to play this game. The amount of references is insane and the characters are potatoes. I have played this game quite a bit and am happy to say I regret nothing. The game is highly enjoyable but also has a good design and story. I love all of the little things and parodies I saw in characters, items, contracts, and choices.\n\nTL;DR\nHoly Potatoes! A Weapon Shop?! This game is full of references to gaming, literature, and movies. The story is solid and the gameplay is enjoyable. You start off with a simple shop with 3 smiths and soon you will have a shop with up to 10 smiths. There is a class tree for your smiths and 4 different stats which help your weapon like Magic, Attack, Speed, and Accuracy. While the shop customization is limited and the gameplay can become tedious at times the game is highly relaxing and has many fun features to create an enjoyable experience.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","August 21, 2015","true","28.0"," 115 of 137 people (84%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","84","115","137","10","11"

I was impressed again and again by the level of effort put into the UI, from the shop to the world map to the weapon selling screen. Little extras, like the confetti that appears when a smith brings money home, make cycling through the game menus a joy.\n\nThis is good, because you'll be doing a lot of menu cycling. Where the presentation is vibrant, the gameplay is fairly one-dimensional. The game consists almost entirely of menus to start and end tasks like selling weapons, exploring for materials, or going on vacation. The only visibility into what your exploring/buying/selling smiths are actually doing is a timer filling up over a thumbnail. Even the shop floor, where you can move (very adorable) blacksmiths to different stations to boost weapon stats during forging, feels very cut and dry. This one non-menu activity is also fairly clunky: the lack of a button to pause time combined with a left click to move and select control scheme feels like running underwater as you scramble to move your smiths between stations.\n\nDespite the overall excellence of the menus, tooltips, thumbnails and maps that are, essentially, the gameplay, there were a few oversights that made for more needless work in the game. For instance, a great deal of time in the game is spent switching between your forging stations and the prospective buyers to see what stats they prefer, and what you can craft to satisfy their needs. Because there is no way to see buyer information from the forging stations, you must go through three menus to look at them. Eventually I just wrote down their stats on paper so I could see them in the forge.\n\nI hate to say this, because this game clearly represents a substantial amount of work, and I honestly will look for the next game the studio puts out. Holy Potatoes comes in a beautiful package, but the gameplay lacks substance. While a fast forward button does help to cut down the waiting that mostly fills the spaces between menu clicks, the game unfortunately loses its novelty fairly quickly. If the game were cheaper, it could have been a good buy for the three hours of fun I had with it. At this price, I can't recommend it.","July 14, 2015","false","6.7"," 172 of 235 people (73%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","73","172","235","9","9"

Move ranty explanation below. Essentially, it is a casual game if you like Game Dev Tycoon, you will be fine with this game. Saw something about a save bug, seems they fixed it.\n\nPros:\n+I really like the bribing element of the judging event.\n+Artwork\n+Music\n+Story was amusing\n+Overall good casual game, its not Anno, its not Sim City, who thought it was?\n\nCons:\n-Pause Feature\n\n-Research times are a bit long, I had usually long beat a level and was mostly sticking around to finish up research\n\n-The random events don't seem particularly helpful/hurtful, option to turn off maybe? , reduce frequency.\n-Needs easier way to see smith stats\n\n-When in the workshop your smiths will leave their positions, to get coffee, they should leave a nameplate or the like behind to know where they were standing.\n\n-At 14.99 USD, it is a little high, knocking that down to 9.99 would probably be better.\n\nHonestly a little surprised at the reviews for this game. I see a lot of people complaining about waiting for things to be done etc, but, I honestly can't think of a game in which you don't wait for things to be done. The game does let you speed up time so you really aren't waiting for things to be done that long. Also, if you are just sending one smith out and not doing anything else in the meantime you aren't managing very well.\n\nAnother thing is saying the game doesn't have management elements. You choose your smiths, upgrade them, pick which jobs they have, where they stand as to increase their specific skills, who goes out and does what. Sounds like management to me.\n\nAnother review said that bids for selling items were randomly generated! That is just not true, they're based on the stats of the weapons compared to the desires of the buyer. Some heroes like bows and speed primary, accuracy secondary, they will give you more for that particular item than a hero you likes damage and swords. That one really baffled me when I read it.\n\nI have played both Game Dev Tycoon and Recettear, and as far as I'm concerned this game is a product of those two. The game is not hard by any means in my opinion, it is a casual game. You play this game to waste some time, not for a challenge, I don't believe that is this game's goal. The music is nice and the artwork is great, it has puns and humor. You enjoy looking and listening and getting your potato to be the greatest potato smith there is.\n\n\nReally just super confused who would look at this game and not see it as a silly casual game.\n","July 14, 2015","true","14.4"," 98 of 128 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","98","128","6","2"

Having to move around your people, balance their skills vs. your requirements for different weapons and mitigate your costs became more difficult as time went on.\n\nThe various "god" smiths were fun to hire (but too expensive to keep on staff) for the achievements.\n\nEverything in this game is based on something else.  A game, a movie, a cartoon... it's literally a laugh-out-loud experience to read the cut scenes and guess the different characters and shout outs.  Every single one of the people you meet, talk to or can hire are based off popular characters.  It had to have taken them a ton of time to put this together.\n\nDefinitely a thumbs up from me.

The background story is shallow and childish, as if the stupid jokes and the cute dialogues were supposed to be enough to cover that angle.\n\nIf I had to summarize what I think about this game to one sentence, it would be "Good idea, poor implementation".

A Weapon Shop?! is a wacky simulation game where you manage your very own weapon shop and expand its business across an incredible potato world. Use your potato smiths to forge weapons and sell them to questing heroes.\n\nNobody knows that you are a POTATO. So in this game you are a vegetable and with your team you forge weapons. Sounds crazy, but it is fun. The story is quite interesting also bit sad. I like that it's different story from other games (you aren't the hero, but you are a blacksmith that creates weapons for them). Every year in this game you can participate in Weapon Awards and win potato money or you can just give a bribe. Also interesting feature in this game is that you give names to you creations. When you are reading the dialog, you have to push the button to see what they are tallking about (like in most games). When you press the button, sometimes potatos makes some funny noices. Also the animation is beautiful. There are so many characters from other games or movies that are turned in potatos. These characters are Cloud Strife From Final Fantasy VII, Alphonse Elric and Winry Rockbell from Fullmetal Alchemist, Vash the Stampede from Trigun, Himura Kenshin from Rurouni Kenshin, Totoro from My Neighbor Totoro.\n\nFinal Fantasy VII (ファイナルファンタジーVII Fainaru Fantajī Sebun?) is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square Enix Released in 1997, is the seventh installment in the Final Fantasy series and the game is the first in the series to use 3D computer graphics, featuring fully rendered characters on pre-rendered backgrounds, and was the first game in the main series to be released in Europe. Final Fantasy VII follows protagonist Cloud Strife, a mercenary who initially joins the eco-terrorist rebel organization AVALANCHE to stop the world-controlling megacorporation Shinra from draining the life of the planet for use as an energy source. As the story progresses, Cloud and his allies become involved in a larger world-threatening conflict, facing off against Sephiroth, the game's main antagonist.\n\nFullmetal Alchemist (Japanese: 鋼の錬金術師 Hepburn: Hagane no Renkinjutsushi?, lit. "Alchemist of Steel") is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hiromu Arakawa. It was serialized in Square Enix's Monthly Shōnen Gangan magazine between August 2001 and June 2010; the publisher later collected the individual chapters into twenty-seven tankōbon volumes. The world of Fullmetal Alchemist is styled after the European Industrial Revolution. Set in a fictional universe in which alchemy is one of the most advanced scientific techniques, the story follows the Elric brothers Edward and Alphonse, who are searching for a philosopher's stone to restore their bodies after a failed attempt to bring their mother back to life using alchemy.\n\nTrigun (Japanese: トライガン Hepburn: Toraigan?) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yasuhiro Nightow. The manga was serialized in Tokuma Shoten's Shōnen Captain in 1996 with a total of 3 collected volumes when the magazine was discontinued in 1997. The series continued in Shōnen Gahosha's Young King Ours magazine, under the title Trigun Maximum (トライガンマキシマム Toraigan Makishimamu?), where it remained until finishing in 2008.Trigun revolves around a man known as "Vash the Stampede" and two Bernardelli Insurance Society employees, Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson, who follow him around in order to minimize the damages inevitably caused by his appearance. Most of the damage attributed to Vash is actually caused by bounty hunters in pursuit of the sixty billion double dollars bounty on Vash's head for the destruction of the city of July. However, he cannot remember the incident due to retrograde amnesia, being able to recall only fragments of the destroyed city and memories of his childhood past. Throughout his travels, Vash tries to save lives using non-lethal force. He is occasionally joined by a priest, Nicholas D. Wolfwood, who, like Vash, is a superb gunfighter with a mysterious past. As the series progresses, more about Vash's past and the history of human civilization on the planet Gunsmoke is revealed.\n\nRurouni Kenshin: Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story (Japanese: るろうに剣心 -明治剣客浪漫譚- Hepburn: Rurōni Kenshin Meiji Kenkaku Romantan?),[2] also known as Rurouni Kenshin and Samurai X, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Nobuhiro Watsuki. The story begins during the 11th year of the Meiji period in Japan and follows a former assassin from the Bakumatsu, named Himura Kenshin. After his work against the bakufu, Hitokiri Battosai disappears to become Himura Kenshin: a wandering samurai who protects the people of Japan with a vow of never to take another life. Watsuki wrote this series upon his desire of making a shōnen manga different from the other ones that were published at the time, with Kenshin being a former assassin and the story taking a more serious tone as it continued. The manga revolves around themes of atonement, peace, and romance.\n\nMy Neighbor Totoro (Japanese: となりのトトロ Hepburn: Tonari no Totoro?) is a 1988 Japanese animated fantasy film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli. The film – which stars the voice actors Noriko Hidaka, Chika Sakamoto, and Hitoshi Takagi – tells the story of the two young daughters (Satsuki and Mei) of a professor and their interactions with friendly wood spirits in postwar rural Japan. The film won the Animage Anime Grand Prix prize and the Mainichi Film Award for Best Film in 1988.\n\nYou can also find characters like Batman, Superman, Elvis Presley, Johnny Bravo, Sora from Kingdom Hearts, Will Smith from Men In Black, Lara Croft from Tomb Rider, Agent 47 from Hitman, Kratos from God Of War, Gandalf from Lord Of The Rings, Gordon Freeman from Half LIfe, Morpheus from The Matrix.

A Weapon Shop?! is a cute casual sim/management game about potatoes in a weapon shop.\n\n\nTL;DR before the rant: Decent casual game with devs listening to feedbacks and updating accordingly. Its clicking repetitiveness (especially for completionists) may be improved in the future so keep an eye out. And if you're still not sure about buying it, maybe wait for improvements or a sale.\n\n\nI'm not a big sim games player so I won't be able to compare it to other games in this genre. But so far, with 10 hours recorded on Steam (a bit more offline) I can say I'm enjoying it. It's colorful, it's cute and most of all it's full of humour and references to other games/movies/pop culture (Agent 46, Claude Strife, Nyandalf among others). And a potato-dog.\n\nDespite its look, it's not a mobile game port, it was just made by people who worked on mobile games before. But it could be if you consider the amount of clicking, which could be a bad thing for some. Some other reviews (negative or positive) enter that casual/mobile feeling with more details, take a look.\n\nNice OST by Masahiko Kimura, really fitting.\n\nThe help/tutorial part is well done, slowly accompanying you through the basics over the first worlds. So it makes it easy to understand how to play correctly.\n\nThe interface is pretty clear, except maybe the Whetsapp (a log of events basically). Once you have 6+ blacksmiths it's impossible to follow every change of mood, stats or other things using it.\n\nIt can be a bit tedious at first, juggling between work stations to obtain the weapon stats you want but after a while your blacksmiths will have better stats and this will balance the results. Then boosts and enchantments will allow you to make more powerful weapons with more freedom over the stats. Plus a dog to boost the morale of your blacksmiths and an assistant to boost a workshop (aka all blacksmiths assigned to a specific stat).\n\nIt's also harder at the beginning since you have less blacksmiths (you start with 3) so less simultaneous tasks: 1 blacksmith has to stay in the shop, then the 2 others have to buy materials, explore, rest, sell, train, research... That makes the game a bit slow to start.\n\nAround the end of the 2nd world, it gets a lot easier. You'll probably have recruited your first "big" blacksmith (Okazaki Masamune) and another at world 3 (Heisenberger). Those blacksmiths usually start higher in the skill tree and so they have more versatility.\n\nAt this point money isn't a big issue except after bigs upgrades in the shop (upgrades unlocked after changing world or fulfilling a legendary contract), you can do easy contracts, explore (a lot, I usually send almost half of my blacksmiths), buy, rest, sell while researching (exploring takes around 1 day, researching can take 2-4 days). I spent more time moving my blacksmiths around than actually crafting weapons. I mostly crafted at the end of a world after unlocking every regions to save up some cash and get rid of low level components I received while exploring. I currently get more than the monthly pay for my blacksmiths in 1 sale.\n\nThe game isn't too punishing, even if you end up with the wrong stats on a weapon you'll be able to sell it. Sure it'll sell for less, the hero won't get as much experience but the price will still be decent if it's the right type of weapon and at least 1 stat he likes. Since each world has 10-15 heroes at least, you'll always find someone willing to buy it and rate it decently (often B if one stat is right). From old articles I believe it affected customers loyalty, now it doesn't seem to affect anything, you can keep selling crappy weapon to the same hero. Failed requests also don't have a visible negative impact, except time lost.\n\nOther interesting thing, legendary contracts and blacksmiths have some special unlock conditions, so that's a nice addition and a good motivation to play the game again once finished even if there's no info anywhere concerning those conditions.\n\n\nNow some less positive points.\nPartially FIXED - Total lack of options except the sound, not even a windowed mode and you can't rebind the shortcuts. The mouse is really slow to move the world map, it's easier to just zoom out.\n\nFIXED - The research blueprints management is messy since it keeps everything you already researched. So you have to go through everything to find new blueprints. Same with the weapon chest, it keeps track of weapons you sold and opens the tab containing everything by default instead of what's currently in it.\n\nFIXED - The enchantment window is sorted a bit randomly instead of being sorted by type or quality.\nIf you want to craft weapons for people in a specific place, you'll have to memorize who's where since the forge window only tells you who likes what in the current world and selling 3 weapons at the same place is far better (and less annoying).\n\nSome requests are very hard to fulfill, with a very short time making you drop whatyou're doing if you wan to fulfill it, or asking for a minimum value in a stat far higher than any weapon you've crafted, even if your best weapon so far had 1k attack, you can get a request for a 3-4k attack weapon. But well, if you manage that you'll probably win the next blacksmith award.\n\nHaving to select the spot of a blacksmith each time he comes back from a task. A task is usually short (like 10seconds) so the chance of your initial spot being filled by someone else is very low.\nAnd lastly, it's fairly repetitive. You get new materials, new blacksmiths, new contracts but in the end it's just "more" of everything to manage. I guess it's the point of a management game, I'm just not used to it.\n\n\nAll in all, it's a fun game that'll keep you busy for a fair amount of time without being overly complicated. But some improvements would be welcomed.\n\n7/10, but maybe get it on sale.","July 16, 2015","true","40.9"," 23 of 33 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","23","33","0","2"

A Weapon Shop?!  Is a cartoon comedy game filled with areas, people, weapons, weapon awards, weapon crafting and oh so many potato puns. The game is about you, a young potato who just inherited an old weapon craft shop from your dead grandpa, now as that sounds the game is very comedy filled. It has a wide variety of craftsmen each with their own ability to enhance weapons. Pretty much all characters in the game except for 2 (which you can name yourself) have a name that is a reference to a popular video game character or a celebrity but slighty different which is quiet funny!\n\nThe game overall is really fun, you run a weapons shop, craft weapons with various items you can find throughout the world or buy from shops. for the first 5 hours or so of the game I was having a real blast! I was crafting and leveling up and moving through the game rather fast. After the five hour mark though things got a big too repetitive, explore for materials, craft weapons, sell weapons, repeat. Which is where the game had it's real downfall.\n\nNow just for reference, there is a speed up timer that makes the game faster, I just kept that on so I powered through the game a bit faster than other people probably would, so just keep that in mind.\n\nPositives:\n+Fantastic cartoon artstyle.\n+Up beat music that fits well with the game.\n+Every character almost is a refernce to a video game character or celebrity.\n+A lot of areas, each with there own potato people to sell your weapons to.\n+Funny potato jokes throughout the dialouge.\n+Various types of weapons that you can make.\n+You can add enchantments to your weapons.\n+"Gold Hammer Awards" happen every in game year which are fun.\n+Story is quiet long.\n+Shop to add decorations to your potato shop.\n+Objectives that guide you through the game.\n\nNegatives:\n-After 5 hours of playing on the fastest game speed, the game got repetitive and sort of a bit boring.\n-Decorations are really expensive and don't do much.\n-Hiring new workers dosen't really have that much of a point and costs a fortune.\n-There are choices of faith, which are just a matter of luck if you choose the right option, and you can get serious debuffs if you pick the wrong one.\n-The coices of faith repeat themselves after a while.\n-After a while the objectives just become: "Reach milestone number xxxx"\n\nOverall I rate this game a fair  7/10  would highly recommend on sale but not at full retail price.","August 7, 2015","true","12.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","2"

They expected Recettear and felt the game lacking because of it.

A Review?!\n\nYou know, not a lot passes my desk that instantly grabs me. Not a lot. I was sitting comfortably in front of the start menu thinking "very mobile-like", looking at the basic options. Yep, basic. No resolutions yet, no this no that. But then, for what it is, it doesn't need all of that fluff. Which to be honest, would just drag the game down in bloat and add more to the download that you pretty much don't want for options you'll never use.\n\nSo like I said, I was sat there looking at this mobile-like menu, and then I click to start the game. Suddenly the world turns upside down, and I'm transported into something, really unique. I have to say it, it is very unique. Obviously I'm not going to descibe my playthrough of this game (to be fair, I didn't get too far, but more on that later[1]).\n\nSo, where to start.\n\nFirst off, if management games of any kind are of any interest to you, I would stop reading and just buy it as this review will spoil an awful lot for you, you really have to play this game blind.\n\n---------------[ SPOILERS FOR NON-BLIND PLAY-THROUGH'S ]--------------\n\nThe game itself, while basic and looking at lot like Game Dev Tycoon, has you in a workshop that makes weapons. It forges weapons for your heroes, or should I say, the heroes you normally play as. "Huh?" The premise is that you are playing an RPG, but instead of playing through the dungeons, you yourself are creating the very weapons that your RPG characters usually use. Such as a dagger for your thief class, or ranger. You have your axes for fighters and what not.\n\nWhilst building these things can take time, it has to be done proper.\n\nMoney in the game is $tarch, starch, or what a potato is made of. You begin by inheriting a shop, once you get through the amusing cutscene you play a tutorial of sorts. You hire some craftsmen for your shop, to make the weapons for you. With names such as "Laura Craft", "Bulk Bogan" and "Spudlock Holmes", you will be sat there smiling to yourself. Once you have hired your staff the next thing you will want to do is scour the shops for some resources. So you send one off to buy from a shop. Once back with your gear you are free to create a weapon. Here it has a nifty little trick. As you make your weapon, you should take note of what you are making. For example, for an axe, you would want it's attack (ATK PnP guys) higher than most and if it's a ranged weapon like a bow, you would want the accuracy up. During creation you can boost stats, with your craftsmen, or for a fee on a one off freelancer for higher stats.\n\nAfter forging your new weapon, you can whack it in the chest and make more weapons or sell it. To sell items it is really easy, You simply select a levbeled crafter and send them out. you can select what type of hero will use the weapon (here is where you should know your RPG classes), and if it was a quality item, the hero may even level up!\n\nDuring the game your job is to get fame, spread throughout all regions and level up heros with YOUR weapons. In other words, you must become the Microsoft of RPG heroes!\n\nThe sound itself and the music in the game is really quite surprising. I was going to leave my music playing but thought "no I want to hear what this game has, apparently it was awarded for it." So I switched it off. And thankfully I did too as the game has a great soundtrack to it. I really enjoyed just sitting in the Steam overlay for half an hour just listening to the music whilst having a chat with some friends. The music is lively, and very Zelda-esque. It really did remind me of the older Zelda games.\n\nAnd after all this, I really cannot fault this game at all. When I first saw it I passed it off, but someone mentioned it and thought "yeah okay let's try it!" I love my indie games, and I love games that break the mould, and this is the indie that breaks the mould. Hands down, best game by an indie developer I have played in a very long time. Very happy to have had the experience to play this as it does show you your RPG items from another side of the coin.\n\n[1] I have but one issue, and it really is a small thing. I would love this game on Linux, but as it is, no Linux. Like I said, small thing, personal preference, but that cannot detract from what it is.\n\nThe game is a masterstroke of genius in a crowded market and worthy of purchase.\n\n10/10","July 18, 2015","true","1.2"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","22","33","2","3"

What a Wonderful Game!\n\nIf you've ever played Game Dev Story, or similar Kairosoft titles, or Fiz (brewery) on mobile devices, you'll love this game. This is the type of game I've been keen to see on steam - a proper, fun simulation that involves a shop but no adventuring. Which is exactly what you get here.\n\nThe game starts as you inherit 0.01% of your grandfather's blacksmith shop and take over management of it. The tutorial is perfect, and funny - easily leading you through the basic steps of how to play - which is how to smith weapons, how to sell weapons (and who to sell to), how to buy materials and how to boost weapon stats. While you are locked to accessing 'noob village' at the start for buying and selling, there are other locations which will become available as you progress.\n\nGraphically this game is lovely - it is very cute, and very unique. Think Cyanide & Happiness for how it looks. It is colourful, and easy on the eyes. It doesn't look cluttered and I was never lost for where to find anything. The menus are clear and the text easy to read.\n\nThe game plays with no issues, no bugs, no lags. The controls are excellent, and intuitive. There are 3 speed of play choices, and all are able to be used from the start. This means that there's no feeling of waiting on things to happen.\n\nWhile I have referenced Kairosoft and similar titles - this games stands alone and apart from them - with random events happening throughout play (and breaking up the waiting while weapons are being forged) and phyiscally leaving the shop to buy and sell. Where this game is similar is in the mechanics of how staff function, and in boosting and in staff levelling. For anyone familar with similar titles, this will feel very comfortable and enjoyable.\n\n10/10 :-)","July 15, 2015","true","2.5"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","3"

At least not if you are looking for an actual engaging business sim. After less than a minute of playing the game, it struck me how much it already seemed to be setting itself up for a mobile game, by which I mean the F2P waiting game variety. I was hoping that I was wrong and that things would become more interesting, but they really don't.\n\nThere are no real strategic decisions to make in the game, and the decisions that are available are of very little consequence. For the most part, all you are doing is this:\n\n1) Tell your potatoes to make a weapon\n2) Wait while they make it (you can easily imagine purchasing a speed up with "gems" here on mobile)\n3) Send one of your potatoes to town to sell it.\n4) Wait while they sell it (again, you can imagine the gem gimmicks on mobile)\n\nSame thing applies when you're applying buffs to a weapon, or sending a potato to purchase materials. Ultimately what Holy Potatoes feels like is a game that was very much intended to be a F2P/mobile game with in-app purchases, but has simply removed the in-app purchases and sold itself as a commercial title.\n\nI can recommend the game for its charm, and perhaps as a game to kill time when you are waiting at the doctor's office, but I don't think I can recommend it as a very good sim on PC.\n\nUsing my own rating system below, I peg the game at a 3.\n\n7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.\n6) A good game that is worth the full price.\n5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.\n4) A fairly good game, but I'd recommend buying it discounted.\n3) Not great, but a few redeeming qualities.

This is mainly a management game, your goal is to make weapons and sell them for profit, and there is a little story there to be told.\n\nWhile the game might look like a mobile port, and the scarce menu might hint to it as well, Holy Potatoes! doesn’t have some of the annoyances other mobile and social type games have: namely the ‘friends’, the ‘coins’ that you buy with real money (at least, they aren’t there for now), nor the energy bar that restricts your playing. By all means, you’re free to grab the game for a five minute of five hours stretch without any lack-of-energy penalty.\n\nWhat it does lack, and my biggest complaints with the whole thing, are things that the developers seem to be currently working on: A pause button, and the ability to put the game on windowed mode. That is, a windowed mode with more resolutions, for you can alt+enter but it remains at a ridiculously unnecessary large resolution as of current.\n\nHoly Potatoes! has some funny dialogue, cutesy sound bites, ok button sounds, and background music that I personally found annoying enough to mute. The character designs are on the cutesy cartoony side, with some of them and some expressions being far cuter than others, but overall being fairly decent. There’s several references to pop culture (you even get famous adventurers come in to make requests from you) which make the game interesting and funny.\n\nThe game is fairly simple as far as management gameplay goes.You make use of the various menus to purchase or find items to make weapons with, and then you sell said weapons to adventurers. There is some depth to be had with this system: The adventurers you sell to actually level up thanks to your weapons, which brings you fame. The smiths are not locked to a single job station, your metal worker can become a designer who in turn can become a craftsman. This allows you to level up in more than one aspect, and as you level each smithing ability to max (5), you get to unlock further smithin abilities that will allow you to make stronger weapons.\nAs with every management type of game, you can enchant things, decorate and expand your shop, buy some items that will boost workers’ morale or abilities, etc. You can even send them on vacations when they get too depressed, which makes for a nice change of pace. There is also a nice weather system in place that affects the workers.\n\nThe only thing I found annoying with the system were the “random” encounters which happened a little too often (but I hear the devs are also working on it). Since you can choose up to two different speeds above normal to play it on, the interruptions of these random encounters become far more noticeable and terribly annoying: You’re not even done doing one thing that another one pops up. Still, they bring some nice boosts (money and smith stats) when you get them right, and some of them are also rather funny.\n\nThere are some things that could be better: like finding what weapons sell best where, or having more maps, etc.\n\nThe developers seem to be fairly active in listening to the users and working out the kinks of the game, which is always pretty amazing.\n\nIn its current state I would give this game a 6.5, going on 7/10 when they fix the pause and window mode issues. As far as management games go I would recommend this one as good game. I’m not certain, however, that I would recommend it for the full price unless there was more content added to it.","July 16, 2015","true","10.8"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","15","22","0","0"

It progressively gets more challenging and interesting, but the whole game is introduced in stages. In the end, it becomes pretty complex, but you feel like you're equipped to deal with all of it. It's also not too cluttered like other sim games - there are a right amount of buttons, positions etc.\n- The complexity - you start from just making a couple of weapons, to being able to explore for material, forge new weapons from that material, train your staff and send them on holiday when they get too stressed, think about their "class"" ( yes there is a class tree that they can progress along), upgrade your shop, deal with various events etc. So it's really quite multideimensional in that sense!\n- Buttons are placed in logical, natural places, you can accomplish the same task from different screens rather than having to remember where to find a button if you want to do something.\n- Random decision events that pop up - these are pretty cool! They do get a little old after a while, but it's not too much of a hassle cuz you make a 50/50 type of decision.\n\nOverall I really enjoy this game!

With their joyful smiles and innocent lifestyle, what would\ndrive them to require weapons?\n\nWell, let me show you...\n\nHoly Potatoes, A Weapon Shop has been described as nothing more than a waiting game. Much\nlike a facebook or web title, but honestly, there is a lot more to it than just that.\n\nTaking insparation from games like Game Dev Story, Weapon Shop De Omasse and Recettear: an\nitem shop's tale, Daylight Studios have pushed their way through Steam Greenlight and come\nout with a relaxing and fun title that had me hooked for hours!\n\nAt first you meet with Agent 46, now here's a guy with something to hide... I wonder where\nI remember him from? He says that he owns 99.99% of the Blacksmith Shop. Something\nabout an agreement with your Grandfather who owned the shop before you inherited it. You only\nsee him when he comes to collect his cut of Starch, that's the currency of the game, and\ncontinues to increase each time. I haven't found out what happens if you don't have enough,\nbut I could guess he would either give you more time to give him his cut, considering he failed blacksmithing school and needs someone to turn a profit in the shop, or just pull his silverballers and make a holy potato.\n\nLuckily, your Blacksmith Shop doesn't come completely empty, you start with some workers that resemble Potatofied (Yeah, I'm making that a word) Potatofied versions of Lara Croft, Hulk Hogan and the Comedian Russell Peters. All with their stat specialisation of Strength, Speed and Accuracy. When making weapons, they can be moved around to help at the different forges or sharpening stones to increase the stats on the weapon being made, but make sure you have an adventurer to sell it to that likes those stats or you won't be making any money... starch... gems?  Actually, Potato Gems would have been a totally awesome premium currency, except there is no premium currency or micro-transactions in this game! Good Job Daylight!\n\nYou need to look after your smiths, sometimes they can get into a bit of a funk and need a holiday. Off they go, all expenses paid for a day or two of rest before coming back to work. They can also be sent off to buy or search for materials, training or sent off to research new weapons to make. Where do they go to research? The bookcase of course! Then through the purple portal behind it. Who knew?\n\nIf you take a look at the Adventurers that you want to sell to and their location, you can make a couple of weapons with their prefered main stat and only make one trip to sell what you have made. Early on, I made a few mistakes as you can't sell to the same adventurer twice in one visit as once they've bought a weapon, they're not there to sell another one to, so mix it up!\n\nMaking weapons is easy, first, click that Forge button, check your buyers, Move your smiths to the prefered stat stations, click that Forge button again and make a weapon!\n\nAs the smiths are making the weapon, they wave their arms all about. I don't get it, I thought they'd need to use the hammer or hold the weapon at the grinding stone or hold it in the forge, but nope, they wave their hands in the air like they're at a rave!\n\nYou can also boost the prefered stat on the weapon by selecting it and hoping that the gods are on your side. A good stat boost make for a more expensive weapon and keep Agent 46 from mashing you. You can also pay for more experienced potato smiths for a huge increase early on if your employed smiths haven't trained up enough.\n\nAfter making a few weapons, you hear a sound outside... No, it can't be... a Potato Dog? What the hell? are there Potato Birds? Potato Fish? Hipotatopotimuses? You can't be serious. Ah well, he seems to make the other smiths happy, so lets give it a name.\n\nI'll call you  Waggleton the Third! There we go!\n\nThere are many potato dogs like you, but you shall be mine! Oh, a Finding Nemo Reference, how cute.\n\nSplas Splash, Splash Splash? Wait? What? Dogs don't go "Splash Splash", Oh you little...\n\nThen it just runs around barking and whining, annoying all the other smiths in the shop and eating food.\n\nOh, look at how happy he is, he has a mountain of food, until he eats it all and repays you by taking a dump in his food bowl. That's grattitude for you, "Oh, I eat all my food and now that it's gone I'll dookie in my bowl" that's real nice. And being a Potato Dog, shouldn't it be mashed potato instead? I dunno, I have a feeling I'm thinking to much into it.\n\nHoly Potatos a Weapon Shop is a fun, relaxing game that passes the time well and has enough depth to keep you interested and wanting to make "Just one more weapon" or do "One more thing" before leaving the game. And to me, that's what making a fun game is all about.","July 23, 2015","true","8.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","0"

The graphics are simple but cute and clear, I liked the different seasons graphics. The music is really nice. The tutorial is very good and the game keep giving you new goals to reach. Goals that you can ignore totally if you want!\n\nThe gameplay become more and more complex as new tasks are added and you'll quickly be clicking right and left, sending your staff on different tasks while juggling with their moods. These tasks include: forging weapons, selling them, buying supplies, exploring for resources, going on vacation (!), training your skills, researching new weapons. You'll customize your shop. You'll expand to new lands, grind for XPs, money and fame. There's even a job tree! There's an annual prize award ceremony where you can bribe the judges. There's also special unique orders to challenge you, or casual simple contracts for some easy money. There's special events that gives a buff to a stat, boosts sells or whatnot; some other events even have choices to make... Wow, just wow. So much stuff packed in this small indie game!\n\nCons: It's pricey and the gameplay become a bit repetitive but the game always manage to surprise you with an event or a silly dialogue. The lighthearted tone and the humor will make you go back to it for a relaxing game session.\n\nTL;DR: Go for it!

Is full of cute graphics, spud humor, and addicting gameplay for those who love the simulation genre.\nIt may seem at first to be a really repetitive experience, but the game keeps growing in depth.\nYou start out as a young potato learning that your grandfather has passed and you inherited his weapon shop. Well, you own 0.01 percent of his weapon shop. Who care, you have a cool new occupation, wait you don’t know anything about making weapons? No worries, blacksmiths do all the work. Blacksmiths like Lara Craft. Who knew a spud raider could be so perky?\nEach blacksmith has a finely tuned skill they start off with and those create stats for weapons for “heroes” Yup, like bandits, pirates, gladiators, and snipers. Totally the hero type, if you know what I mean spud.\nEach blacksmith’s specialty goes to an attribute. Attack power, Accuracy, Speed, and Magic. But as you progress, the game starts to open up, as you can upgrade your shop, hire more blacksmiths and work your blacksmiths skills until they master everything.  It takes time, training, but worth it. You’ll learn tricks along the way, learn which “heroes” like what weapons and what stats are within reach.  Take a look at the training tree, there are lots of reasons to re-assign job titles in order to become a weapons master. There are tons of little details in this game that shine, from random decision making about where or not to turn on a tv that is outside of your shop to saving kids from bullies, to random statues to put in the store, it’s quite the adventure.\nAlways be on the lookout for the annual weapon awards, here if you win, you get cash bonuses, and maybe get some starch into the judges hands for a little positivity in your direction. Yes, starch is really the currency, and yes, I LOVE IT!\nOnce you start gaining reputation Big time heroes start looking for you, they will request very specific weapons and give you lots of bonuses. Plus the interactions are hilarious and full of spud puns.\nIt’s a fun story, a well put together simulation game, and I found myself losing track of time while playing this game. I say it’s well worth the 14.99, and if you dig fun music, great artwork, and Lots of potato jokes, it’s a must have.\n","July 22, 2015","true","10.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","1"

Agent 46  the world's deadliest assassin  the first character introduced to you in the game will teach you the basic mechanics of the game. The goal of this game is to create various weapons and sell them to heroes to earn $tarch (the blood of your fallen brethren) to progress through the story.\n\nThe game is a hit or miss as it resembles and plays like a mobile or tablet game than a PC game. So this review will be my opinion on this game and might not be the same as yours.\n\nThe game is fairly simple, in order to create a weapon you must have the materials to create it and then assign your Smiths to a specific workshop to increase a weapon’s stats which are Attack, Speed, Accuracy and Magic. These weapons are then sold to heroes who act as your customers.\n\nEvery hero has their own stat preferences and will pay more as well as give a higher grade for a weapon with high stats which matches their own specific preferences. The better the weapon the more experience the heroes will gain to level up and the more starch you get.\n\nYou start off with 3 Smiths and can get more as the game progresses eventually attracting "Legendary Smiths" and "Legendary Heroes" to your workshop. Most if not all the Smiths are references to popular media such as anime.\n\nSmiths perform better if their happiness is high which is increased by sending them on vacation or having your "Potato Dog" assigned to their workbench. Overworking your Smiths will lower their happiness. At the end of each season you must pay your Smiths. The pay depends of the stats of your hired Smiths.\n\nOvertime you get the options to explore areas to find materials to craft weapons, relics to research more powerful and new weapon types.\n\nYou also get the option to move to new areas where you will find better materials and more heroes with higher weapon standards. Moving to new areas allows you to buy more decorations and you get more space in your Weaponshop increasing the amount of Smiths you can have.\n\nThere are tons of various events which happen from time to time ranging from Aliens granting you knowledge, earthquakes to choosing to turn the TV on or not. There are also the yearly Hammer Awards which rank the weapons on their stats. There are 3 awards to be won with the 3rd one always being the most stats. The 3 judges can be bribed to give you a better chance at winning the awards but you might get caught and get disqualified.\n\nThe graphics are cartoony, cute though simple but good nonetheless. The characters and weapons are distinct in appearance so every Smith has a certain charm to them. The story is okay but suffers from the fact there isn't much character development and if there is any, the change is so drastic that the character loses their identity,  *cough* *cough* Agent 46 *cough*\n\nHoly Potatoes! A Weapon Workshop is all in all a fun game for your first playthrough, but subsequent playthroughs get boring as the game ends up being, you assigning your Smiths to stations and waiting for weapons to be made. For 15$ I would not recommend Holy Potatoes! A Weapon Workshop but if you get it on sale for 10$ or lower it is a fun and addicting game.","August 3, 2015","true","30.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Both are very fulfilling and make me smile.  Holy Potatoes puts you in charge of you own weapon shop in a RPG universe filled to brim with eager adventures. The goal is simple, earns lots of cash....erm..starch!! What makes Holy Potatoes so great aside from its adorable art style, wonderful music, and easy to manage UI is that the game embraces you as the player and draws you into all of the elements of the game. It doesn't overwhelm you with tons of micromanagement, however this hot potato has plenty of similarities with an onion. This game is deceptively simple at first and slowly reveals all of its layers to you. From vacations, job classes, contracts, research,  Holy Potatoes brings plenty for you to manage and keep track of. At the core of this tater though is blacksmithing, you will forge epic weapons for all manner of adventurers and even some legendary characters you wouldn't expect. Along the way you may have all sorts of random events that can occur, from workers getting sick to sudden price hikes. Simply put, it's very hard to find the blemishes in this tycoon simulator.

Yes and No, if you are really into these sort of games then you will probably want to buy it (i would suggest that you look into it abit more though, If you arn't into these sort of games but like what you hear i suggest waiting until the price drop.\nUpdate2: They have now patched the game so it fixes the problem of the saves going corrupt, So I am changing my review to recommend it.","July 14, 2015","true","19.6"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","18","30","0","0"

Is a mix of management simulation and role-playing game. With light-hearted humor,  you manage a weapon shop that employes various craftsmen to make weapons for adventurers throughout a variety of lands.\n\nWhile the game looks like a variant of something like Game Dev Story, it is not by the same developers. Gameplay shares some similar aspects and so does presentation.\n\nIn Holy Potatoes!, you'll hire freelancers to improve your weapons, level up your craftsmen in various abilities, cross-train their abilities, send them to explore unlockable regions for materials and relics and enchantments, reserch new weapon recipies, and use your advanced weapons to level-up the adventurers of the land.\n\nI streamed this game for four hours (see below) and a sentiment I kept finding myself sharing is that this feels like it would be more at home on a mobile platform. By which, I mean that on a mobile platform, it has just the right level of depth and complexity for that environment, but doesn't meet the standards you'd generally have for a game to keep you tied to your desk. I don't want to sit at a computer and play this for hours at a time. I want to play a bit of this on my tablet while in bed, before falling asleep. Daylight Studios appears to be a mobile developer, though this also seems to be their first game (and PC only, at this point). I can only assume this is going to be ported to mobile, where it'll feel more appropriate.\n\nSpeaking of hours at a time . . . this game takes a very long time to ramp up. In the four or five hours that I played on stream, it wasn't until the very last few minutes that I finally unlocked most of the aspects of the game. It is easily a couple hours of gameplay before you even open the ability to research. The pacing just seems glacial. Like its meant to be a "wait an hour, then come back and press a few more buttons and wait a few more hours" experience.\n\nOverall, I had an okay time and I didn't mind the non-stop cultural-reference puns. I am not sure I will play this again, though. I also think that $15 USD is steep for what it offers.\n\nIf this is the style and pace you enjoy in your gaming, I would recommend picking this up on a sale. If you're not sure how you feel about this type of game, then I'd wait for a steep sale. Otherwise -- and despite the overall craftmenship of this game seeming very good -- I just can't recommend such a slowly paced (and eventually very repetitive) game at this price. I look forward to giving it another go on mobile, when (surely) launches on iOS.\n\nUltimately, while not a bad game, I would not actively recommend it. If Steam had a middle ground "meh" ranking, that's what I'd give it.\n\n(Skip to about 7m)\nhttps://youtu.be/KX368nrZ8uc","July 14, 2015","false","5.0"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","18","30","0","0"

You are taking over for your deceased grandfather, who was a great potato smith. You get to name your smith, and I being the creative person I am (sarcasm) named him potato. You own his 0.01% of the weapon shop. Agent supposedly owns the other 99.9% and he claims that your grandfather and he had made this deal. The following may be a spoiler: Agent seems reluctant to talk about himself, your grandfather, and the past. I haven’t finished the game yet but I’m suspicious of agent.\n\nSo anyway, your mission is to craft many weapons to sell to heroes around the universe. Each hero has a preference of the type of weapon and what stats he likes. There are four stats: attack, speed, accuracy, and magic. You can also research new weapons and that gives you the ability to craft that weapon. Once you move onto the next universe, you cannot research weapons in the previous universe, so I suggest you research all of them before moving on.\nIn the beginning, you start off with 3 employees. Later on you gain/hire more. The staff can gain experience for crafting, selling, and exploring and level up. Each member can boost a skill that they are assigned to. Once they reach max level, they won’t gain xp anymore and you have the option of changing their skill (attack, speed, accuracy, or magic).\nThe story line is really interesting and enjoying. The dialog is great. You know how some games you want to skip the dialog? This isn’t one of them. I really love all the puns and music references. I also love the characters’ personality. There are trivia and random events that keep the game engaging.\n\nI think this game would make a good mobile game. It’s the kind of game I’d like to play on the go. If it were available for mobile or some other handheld device, I’ll get it right away.\n\nThe graphics are wonderful and clean. I love looking at it. And the colors are perfect. Not too bright or dark. I don’t know how to explain it but the graphics, colors, and game play are seriously wonderful.\n\nI did have some trouble with lag and freezing, usually when I change areas (ie from shop to map) HOWEVER I’m not sure if it’s from the game itself or from my computer. And I’m really suspecting it’s from my end but I’m not 100% sure. But this doesn’t hinder the game or make it unplayable, and it sure isn’t a brother (not like dota lag/freeze). You can easily ignore it – it isn’t annoying or a pain.\n\nIn summary,\n\nGraphics 10/10\nColor 10/10\nStory 10/10\nGame play 10/10\n\nIf you love potatoes, puns, and making things this game is for you. Actually you should just get/try this game anyway lol. It’s really fun and addicting. I can play for a while without noticing the time go by. Especially since I have to have everything perfect and to completion, like researching all the weapons and getting every hero to max level before moving to the next universe.\n\nIt really looks like a lot of hard work has been put into this game.\n\nAnyway, overall I give this game 10/10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","July 22, 2015","true","18.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Holy Potatoes!\nThe UI is very clean, simple, yet feels intuitive.\nIt was such an enjoyable playing experience with so many interesting objectives to do,\nwhile jokes, puns and pop culture references keep sprinkling at you along the way.\nWithin my first 90 minutes playthrough, I spent half of it chuckling...a lot.\nSo, even if you are not really into simulation game, I'd say give it a try; you'll see.\n\n-Music-\nEvery time I play simulation game, I tend to turn off the music, while cranking up my own MP3 playlist;\nhowever that was not the case with this game.\nThe BGM and SFX complement each other, the music is catchy, relaxing, and fun to listen,\ntherefore I prefer to listen to its musical score rather than my own playlist, which is a very rare occasion.\nThey make you feel like you are actually living in a world of Potatoes.\n\n-Conclusion-\nNuff said, I'm gonna grab my iPhotato, and recommend this game to my friends through WhetsApp.\n\n(Batmon Approves)\n","July 24, 2015","true","1.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

A Weapon Shop?! as Daylight Studios say, is a wacky simulation game where you manage your very own weapon shop and expand its business across an incredible potato world. It's quite an interesting idea, especially when most games make you the hero instead of the blacksmith making the weapons for the heroes.\n\nStory-The storyline is something about your grandfather who died, leaving you behind his weapon shop which 99.9% of is owned by your boss, Agent 46. And no, Agent 46 is not where the pop-culture references stop, from Laura Craft to Bulk Bogun, and you singing "Everything is Awesome" from The Lego Movie, it may or may not amuse you.\n\nGameplay-The game itself basically revolves around potatoes forging weapons for heroes, villians and basically just anyone who needs a sword. You can unlock new worlds to sell your weapons and also go exploring for new items. All these worlds are quite creative, for example you have the Miso-Soup Swamp and Root Beer Tower. You send your potatoes to these worlds to go and sell/buy anything you want.\n\nArt style-The art style is very cute, I think this is something that gave the game a bit of hype, especially with everything being potato-fied. Even as they're working away, your potatoes have their arms up in the air dancing around.... I'm pretty sure Sips summed it up pretty well:\nAlright, so, Laura and the rest of these potato guys look like those stupid-♥♥♥ things that are filled with air that you see at used car lots and stuff, you know the things where there arms wave around in the wind an stuff!"\n\nGrinding-You get to research and forge hundreds of weapons, all the while you try to complete your objectives. After a while the repetitiveness of the game kicks in. As you try and complete your objectives it starts off with it being pretty quick for you to complete your objectives, but later on it takes ages to finish just one, especially when you have a limit of selling just 3 weapons at once, which can make people incredibly bored. That being said, you sometimes get a random choice on whether you should say hello to a man who looks like your mother or just keep walking (they obviously aren't as stupid as my example), this can occasionally break up the monotonous gameplay. Overrall though, there isn't much you can actually do in the game.\n\nDifficulty-There isn't a lot of difficulty in the game, if there were more challenges in the game like the deadlines it might spice things up a little bit. I would suggest that maybe there should be more effects from the random events.\n\nCustomization-Once you have gotten slightly bored with forging weapons and all, you can decorate your little potato blacksmith hangout, and make it a more comfortable place. Change the wallpaper, add a carpet and a nice little dog house and much more.\n\nPrice-One of my main problems with this game, aside from the repetitiveness, was the price. $15 for a game that is basically Game Dev Tycoon with potatoes. I honestly do not believe this game deserves that price.\n\nMusic-It might also be worth mentioning that the music in this game was soothing, nothing spectacular but nice enough.\n\nSummary\nPros\n+Pop culture references that some will find amusing\n+Art style is nice and cute, especially with potatoes\n+Soothing music is soothing\n+Random events are fun and interesting\n+Plenty of different weapons to craft\n+You can customize your shop with various things\n\nCons\n-Very repetitive after a while\n-Even with heaps of weapons to craft, there isn't a whole lot you can actually do in the game\n-$15 is asking a bit too much for this game, it would be better if the price was lowered\n-Not much difficulty in the game\n\nConclusion\nHoly Potatoes! A Weapon Shop?! is definately a fun and enjoyable game, but is also not for everyone. Some could call this game Weapon Dev Tycoon, which would be a valid point. It is also important not to be sucked in just because of the potatoes. The enjoyment of the game will wear off after a while so if you are really desperate for this game, catch it on sale.\n\n7.2/10\n\nLiked that review?

There is lots of management with your potatoes, each being able to level up in all aspects of the weaponmaking, exploring, merchanting, and researching proccesses.  The starting potatoes the game gives you are plenty talented that hiring is not the forefront of your priorities, unlike other similar games (GameDev Story).\n\nLike most games of this genre, you will spend some extra time getting your business up and running.  I have a few hours logged and still enjoying the game.  There is a balanced progression when it comes to unlocking new areas and weapons.  The game does not lockout your progression if you stick to the quests given at the start, also there is no currency other than in-game $, so don't worry about the "Mobile game pay to win" mentality about this game.  Also, the need for purchasing crafting items goes out the window once you start exploring with 1-2 Taters, keeping your stock nice and full with materials, thus allowing you to keep crafting, exploring, researching, and selling.\n\nOverall, I agree that the pricetag might be a bit much for some people. I bought this game knowing what I was getting into after reading the game's description, and I am not disappointed in the least.  If $15 is too steep for you on this type of game, then hold off until it has a sale.","July 14, 2015","true","7.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Game is loads of fun and with the new fix I can fully enjoy the gameplay. So a big THANK YOU to the Devs for quickly squashing a terrible game-killing bug! Thanks Guys!!\n\nThose reviewers that have said there isn't much gameplay in it must mostly be into a lot of action gameplay. Simulation games like the Majesty series, Dungeonkeeper and subsequent homage titles, and any Sims/City-Builder type games are all fairly "Hands-Off" in gameplay styles.\n\nMuch Like those games, in Holy Potatoes, you don't directly control every aspect of gameplay, but you do basically issue orders to your Smiths. You order weapons made, move your Smiths around to different workstations to optimize the Stat you want on your weapon, send them out to Explore, Buy Materials (which becomes obsolete once Exploration comes in, can anyone say FREE Materials?), Sell Weapons, go on Vacations (to relieve stress and keep them at peek efficiency), and even Research new Materials to make new weapons!\n\nIf you're into nothing but action gameplay and keeping your finger on the trigger as it were, then this may not be a game for you. However, if you enjoy a more relaxed gameplay setting with quirky characters, goofy cameo appearances (Claud!? XD), and enjoyable management games, then I highly recommend this game to you.\n\n","July 15, 2015","true","13.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Graphic and sound are top notch.\nThat said it's pretty clear that it's a parody with tons of references to more famous games like Half Life, FF and tons of anime and american series: it's a nice title to take a break from more complex games, nothing more and nothing less.\n\nIn-depth gameplay analysis:\n\nForging weapons is fun, but it tends to get pretty repetitive: you just need to assign the right smiths (statswise) to the right place and choose the best weapon type according your customer preferred stats and weapons and then basically wait for the weapon completion, gaining more money and fame by making heroes level up with your weapons.\nSmiths gain exp and level up their classes, starting from a class specialized in only one of the four different stats (Atk, Mag, Spd, Acc) and progressively unlocking better classes specialized in more stats at once. During the game part of the challenge is managing your smiths' class change in order to not waste exp and cover every stat efficiently.\nComparing this to most of the management games I found that there is no economic pressure whatsoever because while the salary of your employees tends to increase quickly so do your gains and the shady agent 46 doesn't ask you money regularly, but just on certain events.\nThis, unfortunately, tends to be a lot more rewarding for the safe and slow grinding strategy (which I don't dislike) since you can gain a lot of money and a reasonable amount of exp by making and selling the same good weapons to the same heroes (even when they have reached max level) making you reach one of the two ultimate classes (the ones specialized in every stat) with most of your characters way before the endgame.\nThe game world is pretty simple, consisting of 4 stages with 3-6 different places each, some places can be explored by your employees to find relics and rare materials to research and craft new weapons, some can be used to buy basic materials, some can be used to train and some to send your stressed smiths on a vacation.\nThe training and vaction prices and events for each place change with the season, while the items for each place are always the same and follow a pretty linear tier progression meaning that the last area unlocked is probably the only one you need to keep exploring because it usually has strictly better items.\nYour smiths can also level up their merchant and exploration skills providing more rewards from exploration and some extra cash and discount while selling/buying.\nYour little shop can be improved by adding a variety of stat-boosting decorations and your smiths can gain temporary status effects that improve/lower some stats and there is also a prize to win each year for the best weapons crafted, these are minor aspects that are not very impactful gamewise, especially at the beginning, but are nice additions.\n\nOverall Holy Potatoes! A Weapon Shop?! is a good mix but tends to become easier and less complex the more you advance through the story, since having smiths that can do anything or a max lvl merchant pretty much takes away every hard micromanagement choice; however this is not intended to be an endless game so when you reach this point you can pretty much rush to the ending.\n\nThe game achievements are the standard ones: craft 25 daggers, craft 50 spears, do this quest that you probably need to do anyway to advance through the story (0 effort required), so they are bad and will require multiple playtroughs/some extra time spent on grinding.\n\nPS If you find yourself liking the game and you want a challenge I recommend buying the DLC.","February 23","true","27.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However, in Holy Potatoes, you can only craft weapons, have to do a lot of tiresome micromanagement of your staff (compared to Recettear), don't get to fight anything (not too put out by that), don't get to set prices to try and overcharge people or learn their pricing sweet spots, and either start over or load a recent autosave if you lose.\n\nIf you already have Recettear and played it until you're bored with it and that's your kind of game, so long as you don't mind there being no action, you might enjoy this. Also, people who like lots of micromanagement in games who don't mind a cute asthetic could enjoy it. However, I would not recommend this game. It's okay, but if you want to have fun running a shop in a game, Recettear was far more enjoyable for me.","March 26","false","2.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The art style is consistent, bright, and upbeat; and there's a lot of things to upgrade, research, and level up to keep you busy for a great many hours.\n\nThe issue is that the game is unplayable in its current state due to a game-breaking save bug that will destroy hours worth of progress unless you never stop playing or try to reload an earlier save. If you really like the kairosoft style of management sim, my advice is to keep an eye on the discussion forum and purchase only once other players are reporting that this game breaking bug has been fixed.\n\nI'm also annoyed by the fact that there's no way to pause the flow of time in the game to reassign workers or make changes. You can hit escape to go to the system menu, but while you're looking at the main shop screen you better be a fast clicker if you don't want to fall behind.\n\nEDIT: The save bug appears to have been fixed, I appreciate the quick response from the developers.","July 13, 2015","true","29.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

However the execution of it is really repetitive and boring. Every aspect of the game is waiting for things - you tell your smiths to do things and then you wait. Then you tell them to do more things, and then you wait. I really don't find waiting to be fun.\n\nI also don't like most of the smiths you start with - I wish I could hire my own smiths from a pool. You don't get to hire new smiths until you reach the second town.\n\nResearch is really monotonous. I wish I could research with more than 1 smith at a time. Sending a smith off to research things pretty much means you've gimped the rest of your team and won't be smithing anything until that one smith comes back. It would make the game flow a lot better if you could send all your smiths off to research a bunch of stuff all at once.\n\nKeeping one smith in the shop is really stupid. Nothing happens that you would need them for - they just stand around and pick their nose (at least that's what I think they are doing).\n\nThe golden awards need to be rebalanced. I never won one golden award after going 6 years into the game. I feel like all the golden awards do is add an artificial source of pressure to the player to encourage them to advance faster - but with the game so incredibly boring, repetitive and monotonous, I really don't know how.\n\nI could go on.

You must manage a blacksmith shop: make & sell weapons, hire/fire blacksmiths, send them to explore, find items and unblock new weapons or send them to relax when they feel bad.\n\nThe golden apple of this game is the infinite amount of references, from anime like Gurren Lagan to videogames like Portal, HL3, American shows like How I met your mother?, films like Pirates of Caribbean or cartoons like PPG. If you are freak enough, you will love this game just for the dialogues.\n\nAs a manager/clicker game, is the best game I ever played. By my side it haves some balance problems, but even with that, Daylight Studio is working without stop, adding every week a patch with bug/upgrades/balance fixs, that make the game more and more enjoyable. I already finished the game with full achievents, and I'm still waiting for the new game+ they want to add in a future for play it again.\n\nIt may be a little expensive, but I really think the game deserve it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirCabbage/recommended/363600/","SirCabbage","sir_cabbage_the_green","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirCabbage/","617 products in account","Holy Potatoes is- for all intensive purposes- a Kariosoft style Tycoon game for PC, much like Game Dev Tycoon before it. However unlike the aforementioned title, Holy Potatoes does not reek of a cheap cash grab. It takes a unique setting, fills it with charm and love and then... funnels in every single meme or popular culture reference you have heard for the past 5 years. Is this bad? No, I don't think so. Some of the "references" are rather cringe-worthy but I feel that if you like that kind of humour you will appreciate this game.\n\nHoly Potatoes has a story- one which does fade away rather quickly to make way for the kinds of goals you would expect of a game like this. You will find yourself making a series of weapons, researching more weapons and fulfilling orders OF weapons.  You do get to upgrade your forge and decorate it- however this system seems rather lackluster in comparison to other games of the genre. The most positive aspect of the system is the fact that there are four major "studio" upgrades instead of the normal two or three.\n\nSo most of your time is spent making weapons? How does that feel exactly? Well- a lot of the time making weapons seems to involve simply moving your smiths from one station to another, however your smith abilities do raise as the requirement to move them does which does help. You may name any weapon you create, but there is an unfortunately small cap on the number of letters you may have. During smithing you may "boost" your weapons once..  My problem with this is that there is no way to increase the number of boosts you get yourself with only random events offering chances for extras. I feel as if having some way to increase this boost number- perhaps on lower difficulty weapons- would be beneficial. After crafting you may also choose an "enchantment" known as a Prefix- this is a nice system but I feel as if Suffixes would also have not gone astray as options.\n\nAs it stands the developers do seem interested in offering post-game support which is positive. They have already addressed multiple areas of weakness which I otherwise would have identified in this recommendation.  Their plan currently seems to be patching the issues identified by the community. These issues include; Choices of fate being random, no pause button, too many frequent breaks by workers, the game ends prematurely, windowed mode and multi-smith selection. While these issues are currently in the game, the dev team seems intent on patching them out. So I will not make a big deal of them during this review.  Overall, I would say Holy Potatoes is exactly what I would have expected out of a Kariosoft style tycoon game made on the PC. Make no mistake, this game 'IS' a PC game- not a port. Frankly I hope that the developers keep adding to this game in future since it is a great foundation.","July 15, 2015","true","28.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

A Weapon Shop?!  a few days ago and have played for several hours. It is a fun and very addictive management game.\n\nThe beginning of the game is kind of slow as it is a tutorial area and nothing is unlocked. Now, I am sure there are people that will judge the game based on this beginning part and not give the game an actual chance. So, my first suggestion is to play through the tutorial part and get into the real gameplay where things start to unlock and the game really comes alive. The tutorial part of the game takes about half an hour or so to complete.\n\nThere are new abilities and options that are unlocked throughout the game. You get to research new weapons, unlock new areas to explore and also get new upgrades available to you.\n\nThere are 5 different types of smiths that work in your shop. They all work together to create great weapons. In the beginning there are only 3 smiths unlocked. Later on in the game, you unlock the 4th smith.\n\nAs you progress through the game, you will find various characters and side stories. There are also random events that start occurring. Some of these events will give you two choices to decide from. Your choice can have a positive or negative impact on your smiths or the weapons that they are working on.\n\nThe controls and gameplay in Holy Potatoes are very simple. This is a game that anyone can play very easily. Even if you have a slower system or limited resources, you will be able to play and enjoy this game.\n\nThis is a game that I would recommend to anyone that enjoys management games of any type. It is a game that is fun to play, has humor and comedy elements, and will definitely keep your attention for a long time. It is also a game that offers steam achievements.","July 19, 2015","true","2.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"Golden Hammer Awards" is one of the better events, but still lacks an incentive, the point it is to make the best weapons in 3 categories.\n"Most Powerful Weapon" "Most Magical Weapon" "Most Overall Weapon", now while yours may not be the best, you can "Bribe" the contest judges to make your odds slightly better.\n\nThe Weapon Smithing also has a research function, though there could be more potential (PLEASE CORRECT ME IF IM WRONG ABOUT THIS OR IF THERE IS A LATE-GAME UNLOCKABLE FUNCTION)\n\nThe Weapon Smithing requires Research and Exploration, and the exploration aspect could be expanded to be more than just an ingredient fetch quest (like making an exploration choice, Avoid the treasure chest or Approach it) and after the smith returns from the trip he can bring "Relics" and what it does is to make new weapons, but instead of that, why cant we combine it with a Double Relic combination (2 relics for 1 weapon) or Triple Relic Combination (3 relics for 1 Weapon) so that way the 2 relic only takes about 5hr - 2d 12 hr  and the 3 relic takes 15 hr - 7d 12hr\n\nThere is also requests, which is one of the interesting part of the game, as you will need to make a normal weapon, but with a time limit and some specification that will get harder and harder, and as implemented for an event later on, though it would be better to use those request to make old and new specific weapons ( instead of a general dagger, how about a Kris or Stilletto only ) as opposed to just general new and old weapons\n\nThe Legendary Requests are somewhat of a joke, while the smiths are worth while and worth the ridiculous amount of money, the legendary heroes weapons lack a bit of incentive ( Cloud Strife will give around 3000$ for your weapon smithing, and you usually need to hire one of the better booster like Portana to complete it, so the total amount of $tarch you'll gain is about 1274$ in which you could easily gain 2000$ from other normal customer )\n\nAnd.... thats about as much as i can say about the game from personal experience, the only bug that i found is taht the game crash whenever i press the enter promo code button, and sometimes the game lags out from triple fast-forward while there are multiple smith activity notification.\n\nOverall, an 8 out of 10, wait a letter grade?

Nope, you cannot.\nAbility to research is also barred out for far too long, you are stuck making the same weapons for much longer than needed.\n\nMade an axe using the most expensive expert, gave it stats much much above what the hero was using before, the expert gave more speed than strength despite boosting for strength, so its primary stat was speed. The thief prefered the weapon over the fighter, despite it being an axe. The fighter gave it a low rank because its speed was higher than its strength, despite the weapon having stats 10 times higher than what the fighter was using before.\n\nThe animations for smithing is atrociously lazy, they wiggle their arms in the air next to the work station, instead of doing any actual appropriate animation\n\nThe humor does not appeal to me, it's over the top and rather predictable.\nYou are a loony silly lad who doesnt know better being manipulated by a cynical lad into giving all the shops money.\nAlso pop culture, everything is a reference, everything is a reference, pop culture reference are great right?\n\nSomewhat alike to game tycoon, the game basically plays itself out, not really that much room for strategic decision, the best weapon seems to be pretty blatant to smith, or atleast the game doesnt really reward/punish for your decisions.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sbruler/recommended/363600/","sbruler","Boy Blue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sbruler/","560 products in account","It's an adorable little game. It resembles Game Dev Tycoon in terms of gameplay, with researching, customization, boosting, and so on, but it give its own unique spin on everything making it feel fresh and new. The art style is lovely and at points just made me go, "Aww..." Especially when you get your puppy. That puppy will make you cry, it's so perfect. At various points throughout the game, you are presented with fate choices, which are basic decisions that could be as simple as choosing what to eat for lunch, that affect the way your employees play, either buffing or nerfing them for a short time, complimented with their own unique and enjoyable little plots. Progression in what you can craft involves researching, which is combing various weapon parts, called relics, into new weapons entirely, allowing you to expand your business. As you progress, you can also unlock new places to sell and buy parts, find new relics, hire new smiths, discover new clientel and more. The more that they do, the more your smiths level and the more that they tire. As you can imagine, leveling grants bonuses to whatever the level in (crafting improves stats, merchant improves prices, etc.) and getting tired limits their abilities. The weapon forging system and the managing of stores, employees, and sales is all incredibly easy to grasp with a handful of quest-based tutorials, and the game's graphics should be easy to run on even low-performance systems, leaving you no reason not to pick it up. Especially for the reasonable $15 price tag. The dialogue and story and humorous and witty, riddled with spud puns and game references, and with, again, absolutely adorable, character animations that just make them impossible to skip. Definitely worth a buy.\n\n8/10 would spud again.","July 19, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I repeat, the resolution setting DOES NOT WORK. Which is bad, because I was hoping that might actually help the game run better on my hardware even though it actually should run well because there are no graphics requirements: only a 2 Ghz processor where I have 2.2.\n\nAll this combined tells me this game has a rather shoddily built custom graphics engine. There are no 3D graphics and yet the game manages to lag to hell for no reason on the MAIN MENU where there are ABSOLUTELY NO ANIMATIONS and supposedly ABSOLUTELY NO BACKGROUND PROCESSING, while it works PERFECTLY FINE in the actual game when there is NO MENU OPEN and NO WEAPON FORGING.","March 20","false","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unfortunately, the gameplay is mostly just waiting for things to get done.  Based on what the heroes want, you tell your smiths what weapon to make and which stats to work on, but then all you do is wait for it to be done and repeat.  Occasionally you need to send someone out to sell those weapons, gather materials, or take a vacation to improve their mood.\n\nI don’t consider the game worth it at the normal price of 15 dollars.  Wait for a sale to bring it down to 5 or so.\n","March 27","false","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's a lot of positives to the game, but also a bit of cons as well. The game does well in maintaining a cute charm that blends in well with the story of a potato that inherits a weapon shop from his diseased grandfather. It's kind of like the story of early Harvest Moon games, except the mayor is replaced by a sneaky Agent 46 who claims to be a businessman..Or is he?\n\nThe game plays like many Kairosoft games, so there's that argument about it being a nice looking mobile game on steam. It definitely is one and you'll have to wait a certain amount of time for your weapons to finish and even longer if you're researching new weapons.\n\nAll your potatosmiths level up which allow them to make better quality weapons, or reduce the time of research. They also level up their merchant skills, which allow them to haggle for better prices. By leveling exploration, it allows your smiths to gather a lot more materials when they go on an exploration.\n\nEach smith has 4 different stats that come into play as well. They are attack, magic, speed, and accuracy. Each warrior in the various regions have stat preferences and you'll have to cater to their needs if you decide to sell it to them. Unlike games such as Recettear, you can directly go to the warrior's location instead of relying on a little bit of RNG. Every smith has a stat that they may excel at and in the end, I let go of Bulk Bogan, because his stats weren't on par with some of the other smiths you can hire. Take care brother, you're a real american.\n\nIn order to progress through the game, you'll have to reach quotas that are displayed in the upper right hand corner. Your tasks for these quotas include gathering a certain amount of items, reaching a certain amount of fame, and paying Agent 46. It's a lot easier to do than you may think and sometimes, you'll find yourself nailing several tasks at once just because you've done a lot.\n\nThe story is quirky with tons of potato puns and game references. However, the game ends a bit abruptly, and I don't know if there's a way to get a better ending or not, because once I load my game, it goes to my last task and ends with the same little cutscene without letting me continue to play the game. There's no end game content here, which is kind of a bummer due to the price.\n\nAnother feature I didn't like was the lack of a pause button. I really felt it's needed in this game, or at least an auto pause after you decide your next move when you finish making a weapon or something.\n\nOverall, it's a good game, a little pricy for what you get, but if you're into timewaster games, simulations, or just like puns, this game will be enjoyable.\n\nNote: Devs are currently working on all of the things I complained about. :O","July 15, 2015","true","18.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jewthanasia/recommended/363600/","jewthanasia","Jewthanasia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jewthanasia/","660 products in account","Management sims in a lot of ways live and die by their UI. How easily can I get the information needed to make a decision and how quickly can I implement a plan once I've made my choice? When done well a UI is something you never think about, a seamless extension of yourself. Other times it is like the UI of Holy Potatoes, a game I have to assume was ported from mobile devices due to UI design choices that make no sense otherwise.\n\nBut to back up a little bit and explain the big picture, in Holy Potatoes you run a blacksmith selling weapons to various questing heroes the likes of which most of us have played as in any number of RPG's. Your main currency beyond money is fame and fame is determined by how well heroes perform in the field while using the weapons you build. It's a decent concept for a game and there is a fair amount of depth later on as you manage 10 different smiths and their various needs. In the end though, Holy Potatoes is sunk by two key issues.\n\nThe first is difficulty. Simply put, the game is a cakewalk. You are presented with a series of missions to complete, one at a time by the game. Usually these involve increasing your fame or leveling up the heroes that hire you by giving them superior weapons. And occasionally the game asks you to hand over some money to the shady owner of your smithy. But there were times when I would complete an objective only to find the next three objectives were already completed. The best management sims show how difficult it is to balance the various parts of a major business, but even towards the end when the game becomes a bit hectic, I never came anywhere close to running out of money. And because there is no pressure there the entire game becomes a series of bars that need to be filled. And filling them is inevitable. The only thing making better weapons does is speed up the process.\n\nBut even an easy game can be fun for a while if the act of playing is enjoyable enough. Who doesn't love the occasional power trip or even a game where overcoming a challenge isn't nearly as important as making interesting narrative choices? But this game is neither of these things. For one the narrative choices you make don't seem to have any effect on the story progress, but more damning for a game this easy, you never get that sense of being all mighty because of an awful port job from the mobile version I'm just going to assume existed before this one.\n\nI assume that because of the ridiculous way certain aspects of the game are designed. A key example occurs when you send out a smith to buy more components to make more weapons. You'd expect a menu to pop up that let you type in how much you want of each component but as far as I can tell there is no typing in numbers here. Nor can you hold down a button to have a number increase at a rising speed. No, to buy each and every item you must click on a button over and over, turning something that should be an automated process into tedium. I should be able to tell some smith under me to replace certain resources whenever my stockpiles drop below a certain level. I should be able to research multiple new weapons at once. I shouldn't have to click on an icon every time a smith returns from a job just to put him back where I left him.\n\nHoly Potatoes is a game with potential and I'm curious to see if the recently announced sequel lives up to that potential. In the here and now, though, realize that this game barely qualifies as a management sim, considering how little actual managing you do.\n\nDecent art design and audio work make the game easy to look at and listen to, but the referential humor is just lazy and none of it hides how many key features this self proclaimed management sim is lacking.","March 24","false","11.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But it is a PC game. The gameplay is repetitive, it feels like grinding. No depth to the story and other than the weird setting/names, no humor to speak of.\nThe game was made by lazy developers: half the archievements is 'get x fame' (=points). No rewards, at all. You can add enchantments to your weapons. There are 7-ish tiers of which the final 2 tiers have the same name as the 2 before. Upgrades for your shop are a few passives, but mostly just for looks.\n\nThe balance is the most horrible thing. Level 1 is easy, because half the options are still locked. Level 2 comes with a serious hike in prices, but income goes down 5-fold (or more) unless you make exactly the right weapons (which is actually easy).\nIf you don't focus on the correct weapons, you're lucky to earn even half your salaries in month. Forget about any upgrades. The yearly contest that gives some much needed money, has competitors with weapons about 10-20x as good as yours' (me stuck at 100, tops, they at 2000).\nIf you do focus on the correct weapons. In 2 months, you'll have every upgrade. By early level 3 your weapons' stats are comparible to competitors and winning a prize made my money increase 20-fold.

A Weapon Shop?!" is a management simulation game in which you play as a team of potatoes and operate a weapon shop, gathering or buying raw materials, crafting weapons in a glorious volcano of numbers and then selling them on to hero-tatoes for profit which you can then use to pimp out your workshop. Hey, that wasn't too bad after all.\n\nGames like these are oddly compelling. Watching some numbers increase shrouded in a bunch of cute nonsense, hours can feel like minutes. I guess if you were playing this on a mobile device on the train for example that would be great, but I feel like there are so many better ways to spend your time with a powerful computer at your disposal.\n\nI'm not saying this is a bad game by any means, In fact I think it's a good example of how this style of game can be done well. I just don't understand what the payoff is beyond watching your numbers increase. There is very little by way of interaction or skill on the player's part required as the game does a good job of spelling out for you exactly what you need to create at any given moment. It's addictive, I suppose, because you're given regular acheivable goals with immediate visual rewards (higher numbers, better carpets for your workshop, etc), which is very interesting to think about but ultimately doesn't actually have any real meaning. There is a story to uncover, but it's not exactly Shakespeare.\n\nYes it's cute, and I like that cute things exist, but is cuteness alone worth the price of entry? Or more pressingly the price of your time? You'll have to decide for yourself.\n\nAlso this kind of exists in the shadow of Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale, which for me is a very similar but superior game.","March 27","false","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

With a quirky, interesting theme. It's not going to be the best game you've ever played. But it's a good way to while away time if you happen to need to do that. It is somewhat repetitive. After a while. But the game scales up it's difficulty quite well. It's one  of those games where you can play 10 minutes and think it's the simplest piece of dog doo. But reach the later levels and you ability to keep track of all the multiple things happening at once quickly becomes tested.\n\nHowever I can't help but feel that this premise is wasted on so simple a title. Reccetear which this game is often compared too has far greater depth and is in  all respects .. the better game. However this is a decent first effort for the company. I look forward to seeing what's next on their list. Now they have some experience and hopefully some more money behind them. While this game might not be an earthshaking work of art I reccomend it based soleley on this premise. I had fun playing it. I found the theme enjoyable. And the games well scaled difficulty and essentially sound mechanics has already kept me engaged for hours. And probably will a good while longer.","July 14, 2015","true","15.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There are missions in which you have to fulfill in order to progress with the story, opening up more things to do and manage. It is important to think about how you move the smiths around the different tasks as less smiths in the workshop means creating weapons with lower stats.\n\nI do not play many management games but I feel that this game is capable of providing hours of entertainment with its easy yet diverse gameplay and ridiculous amounts of humor. I look forward to the many more hours I will spend in exploring what the game has to offer.","July 15, 2015","true","1.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Instead make it so you click 3 smiths in to explore that area instead of individually clicking.\n\n- A Quick menu when you go into research that allows you to switch between "Researched weapons" and "Weapons that has not yet been researched" so that you can find the items you want to research quicker without having to toggle through every single weapon you already researched.\n\n- As the game gets harder it would be nice if you could do a full pause. Essentially like it does when you click on one of your smiths.\n\n- An indication of where a smith is standing since it is very frustrating to click on a smith that is constantly walking between the coffee machine and the spot he / she is supposed to stand at.\nEssentially a way to make it easier to click on them even if they move around.\n\n\nEDIT\n\nLooks like they have taken a lot of player feedback and if not all of the things mentioned above then at very least the majority of it has been fixed. so if any of the above mentioned ideas i had made you not want to get this then fear not, it has been implemented :).","July 14, 2015","true","18.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

That, or a grand ol tasty mess.\n\nHoly Potatoes jackets you with picking up the legacy of your grandfather, the ol spud. Once a renowned blacksmith, you begin rebuilding the family legacy as you hire a variety of blacksmiths for your shop to create weapons. Each blacksmith starts good at a specific weapon stat (attack, speed, accuracy), and they work together to forge a weapon.  Send your smiths out to sell weapons and buy supplies at various towns and dangerous areas. Have them explore and locate rare materials you'll need to research new weapons. Send them out on vacation to relax, as a stressed smith is a bad smith!\n\nYou earn $tarch, the world's currency, which you need to pay your blacksmiths, pay rent, buy supplies, do research, and upgrade your shop. A smith can only do one thing at a time, so you need to balance making weapons, selling them, researching, and many other things. Various events will effect both your smiths and your weapons.\n\nOverall, the game is extremely fun and humorous. It doesn't rely on references and humor to be a fantastic game at its core, but it definitely helps.\n\nIf you can't stand a sack of puns, though, you might avoid it.","July 13, 2015","true","2.6"," 19 of 38 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","19","38","0","0"

I see people who don't recommend it complaining about it being a waiting game, but you can easily fast forward time, so I didn't feel like I was waiting around that often. The game is cute and super fun, no doubt.\n\nBuuuut... I beat it in about 8 hours over the course of two days. The first session I played the game, I couldn't stop, but there aren't that many areas to expand to and the game comes to a close too quickly. Without any end game grinding features or anything to reward playing after the story ends, this game does not last very long.\n\nThis wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the price. I definitely do not think this game is worth $15. Maybe $8 or $10, but I feel like I wasted my money for only 8 hours of play. I'm glad I played it! I'm not glad I spent $15 on it. If the price goes down, I'll definitely recommend this game to all of my friends, but I can't recommend it to anyone who doesn't have steam credit lying around doing nothing :/","September 11, 2015","false","13.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

A Weapon Shop?! is a masterfully designed indie game that truly defines itself with it's unique style and story. As the grandson of a legendary blacksmith, you find yourself running his (your grandfather's) iconic yet degregated shop under the new management of a shady figure (who bares remniscent features of Agent 47). The story progresses as you build up your reputation, open new shops with new craftable weapons, and hire some new, strongly recognisable faces.\n\nThis fantastic gem credits its stylism to the widely popular 'Game Dev Tycoon' and is a must for those who love easter-eggs and cameo's from other titles. Brilliant fun and a great time waster for any long journey/commute/"work ethics demonsration" meeting.\n\n\nFor a great mini-review, check out Sips' gameplay in the link below.

A Weapon Shop?!\nWhat it's about:\nIt is similar to games such as Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale, and Game Dev Tycoon. You run a weapon shop, create weapons, explore, buy ingrediants, recruit new potato smiths, and research new weapons.\nThere is an insane amount of content to be had here, and in my near 2 hours in the time of writing, i've only created the first 3 items of the MULTITUDE of items available for crafting.\n\nHow is it?\nI, personally, adore it.\nComing from a fan of both the games that it has been inspired from, I picked this title up as soon as I could, and I recommend every fan of management games do the same.\nIt is super easy to learn, and gradually introduces elements. This keeps down the learning curve to being minimal.\nI found myself laughing at many different times, because this game is FULL of hilarious references and descriptions.\n\nPros:\n-So many weapons\n-You can customize your shop in many ways\n-Awesome system of weapon making\n-AMAZING art style\n-Random events\n-MULTITUDE of things you can do (Explore, send people on vacations,  Save people from a zombie potato apocolypse only to be killed by a potato counterpart of a l4d witch\n-Reference are everywhere, really makes you care about your smiths.\n- You can have a potato dog.\n-So. So many weapons...\n\nCons:\n-Some bugs (none game-breaking)\n-You haven't bought it yet\n\nOverall:\nHoly Potatoes! has claimed it's spot in my steam library as one of my favorites for a long time to come.\nThe developers are super nice, always respond to people in the forums, and generally interact with their\nfanbase.\nTake it from me:This is a gem.\nSo, if you would like to support the developers and their first steam-born game and have an amazing time doing so,\n\nClick that buy button.","July 13, 2015","true","2.6"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

It's a solid 8/10 for while it lasts, but it lasts far too short for $15. Besides the tutorial level, there are three other areas. The story ends, and there is NO real incentive to play beyond that point. No new areas, no new weapons, no new people to sell to. You have all the money you could possibly need when you beat it, and nothing really to spend it on.\n\nPros:\n+References galore\n+Strategy is easy to figure out\n+Area, character, and workshop progression FEEL good\n+Weapon Research has been updated to hide recipes you've already discovered\n+Weapon appearance pretty well matches weapon power\n+Great way to spend a few days\n\nCons\n-References galore\n-Strategy is easy to figure out\n-No menu for characters alone\n-Menus feel clunky\n-Unable to send multiple peopotatoes on explorations/vacations without re-entering clunky menus\n-10 worker cap when machines have 5 spaces means that you have to stick to one weapon type/group of warriors to sell to, just to maximize stats and not have to fiddle with positions after every weapon.\n\nMy strategy was to just mark out which warriors liked/disliked certain types of weapons and attributes in Excel, find a weapon type and workshop setup to make such a weapon, and then mass-produce said weapon. Whenever someone would get in a bad mood, I'd send them on vacation, send someone to sell the weapons, and almost everyone else to explore. It took until the second full area to figure this out, but it carried me so easily through to the end.","July 26, 2015","false","36.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Well to be honest I will have to say yes.\n\nThis game is good.\nI won't go into detail on what is good about it - I would encourage you to read more in depth reviews and they will tell you why you should get this game. And to be honest from a gameplay perspective they would be right.\n\nSo why in the world am I giving thumbs down and refunding???\n\nAn overpriced Kairosoft ripoff...that is why.\n\nHoly Potatoes! A Weapon Shop?! plays identical in practically every way to mobile Kairosoft games such as Game Dev Story, or Magazine Mogul....I am not joking....the resemblance in practically all aspects of gameplay are so similar that you could give this game an 8 bit aesthetic and change your 'smiths' to 'devs' and you would not be able to tell the difference.\n\nSo here it is...don't have a smartphone or like mobile gaming? Not bothered about borderline plagiarism? Don't care that you can get the same game for 5x cheaper? Then yay!....thumbs up! Buy this game.\n\nNot me however...welcome to the wonderful world of refund.","July 28, 2015","false","1.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I'm not saying this is a bad game, but it's a terrible game for me. It feels like it's written and styled for 4 year olds. The "jokes" made me cringe, not to mention that half of them seem to originate from Japanese word plays that simply get lost in translation.All the "choices" offered seemed terribly predictable. For me it felt like a never-ending facepalm with  a Mr. Potatohead toy. I hated this experience so much I didn't even make it out of the tutorial. I would have ended it quicker if the game had let me, but it basically insisted on going through each and every sluggishly presented dialogue with no option of speeding it up or jumping ship.\n\nSo to sum it up, it was a proper waste of time for me, Maybe you're different and love the styling of Clicker Heroes and Little People kids toys - in that case, go ahead and knock yourself out!","May 12","false","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dualityDiscretion/recommended/363600/","dualityDiscretion","dualityDiscretion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dualityDiscretion/","28 products in account","At first glance, it struck me as an interesting idea: playing as a shop owner, managing your shop, researching better weapons, etc. However, the actual execution of the game is extremely lacking. After about 2 hours of gameplay, everything is just a repetitive grind.\n\nFirst off, all weapons from the same category has similar patterns of stat growths. For example, all Daggers have high speed and magic. Thus, there is a single "Best Weapon" in any category, and if you've already had that researched, there's no real purpose in researching the weaker ones other than for completion.\n\nSecondly, the research mechanic is totally boring. They could have made an interface allowing people to "craft" certain weapons by combining relics, but instead they went for a no-depth waiting mechanic, where you just wait for your item to be done.\n\nTo add to that, the explore mechanic ruins the management aspect of the game. You never run out of materials anymore as long as you send your explorer out every month or so. There's no purpose in having shops around the world since your explorer gathers items for free. You end up completely drowning in materials that you don't really need.\n\nNot to mention, some of the objectives require the player to gather a sum of money, and as soon as the player has that exact amount, the game takes it away from the player. One time, it left me completely broke that I wasn't able to pay my hired smiths on the payday.\n\nAll in all, the game had overcomplicated things that could have been simple (such as the general shop interface, the world events), and overly simplified things that could have been expanded and made interesting (such as the research, exploration, and general weapon-making mechanic). There are better games to spend your money on.","May 19","false","10.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But if that's what you like this is DEFINATLY the game for you. The game has some funny moments I wish they would do more. But, the game also has some cool art for the seasons. The weapons are pretty cool. I would asume sometime they'll add more but for now there's enough. The thing i would want them to add the most is a story line and a little more besides grinding all though i love the grind aspect of that. They totally have it down. So they should add some other things. The game is almost bug free the only bug is a sound when i research stuff stays going and sometimes if you go to settings while there sneezing it glitches out and is very annoying. But there only minor bugs. Overall i would rate 4.4/5 stars","July 23, 2015","true","13.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay is largely based upon resource management, requiring you to assign your workers to different tasks effectively and focus on training them in the right areas.\n\nThe early game presents a challenge to use your resources and people efficiently, but by mid- to late-game it's easy to be so overpowered that you don't need to care about efficiency or pay attention to details. DLC is supposed to up the challenge in the game, but the first available DLC was not actually much harder than the base story.\n\nI realize that's not a ringing endorsement, but on the whole, I'd recommend the game if you like casual resource management games.","May 3","true","64.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grapebutter/recommended/363600/","grapebutter","Grape🍇","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grapebutter/","253 products in account","I have two real problems with this, for starters, there's no real customisation with this game. Weapons are given stats by your potatoes according to how skilled they are in certain areas of weapon smithing, but occassionally they can decide to simply not work for short periods making your created weapons not have anywhere near the stats you wanted, and there's no real way of changing this. Even small flash games I've played have had much more interesting smithing than an £11 steam game.\n\nBut my main issue is that there's nothing to DO. You're a weapon smith, you collect materials, craft, then sell your goods, but you don't actually do any of those things; you give them to your workers for them to do, meaning all you're given is a tiny little progress wheel while your workers run off and do everything interesting. You click and watch and wait. It feels like this game wasn't supposed to be on a PC platform with the amount of waiting necessary, I have almost 2 hours which admitedly isn't much, but over an hour of that has been waiting for one thing or another. I think actually I was waiting to see if the humour ever got beyond "we named a character after this other person" but it didn't. Seriously, one of the smiths is called Laura Craft, who occassionally during crafting says "Raiding Tombs!" with zero reason to. No Laura, you're making a bow.","July 14, 2015","false","1.8"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

It's extremely repetitive and has no difficulty aspect at all.\n\nAt times it felt like the developers hadn't even played their own game. The amount of extra clicking required for things that you have to do a million times was pretty frustrating. Like for example, you can't raise the quantity of something you want to buy by holding down the "+" button, you have to spam click to increase once at a time. The game asks you if you want to name every single weapon you ever make, but when you make hundreds of weapons there's no reason you'd ever want to do that, it just adds pointless clicking to each aspect of the game.\n\nOn top of this, there is no resource management in this game at all. It is impossible to lose. You always have enough money and resources to do anything. The monthly fees you have to pay are negligible compared to the insane amounts of money you rake in just by existing. You can't go wrong.\n\nThis game is:\n\n- Spam clicking\n- Waiting around\n- More spam clicking\n- More waiting around\n\nWithout any strategy aspect to it whatsoever. It's completely brainless. As a phone game this would be okay, but as a PC game it's a joke.","July 24, 2015","false","8.8"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Personally I have major issues with games with a high click count for this sort of game. Also its not really worth the price considering what it really is, which is a mobile game on a pc. I was kinda dissapointed that all they do at their stations is wiggle arms. They dont appear to actually be accomplishing anything, the only actual view of progress is a percentage. If you enjoy very simplistic management games then you might enjoy it, but in my experience this is simply too dry of actual gameplay to really be worth your time. The force fed gaming referances do not make up for the lack of quality of life issues(endless clicking through menues), and lack of real effort to deliver an in depth crafting system.

A Weapon Shop?! is a spudtacular, charming and all around enjoyable experience.\n\nIn the short time I've spent with the game which is about 2 hours, I've barely scratched the surface of what I'm expecting to be an incredibly deep sim game.\n\n(First 30 minutes)\nhttps://youtu.be/H0atXpRqv8I\n\nYou are the grandson of a legendary blacksmith 'Patata' and inherit his blacksmith shop. Your landlord controls the profits though. You only own 0.01% of the shop so you're working for the man. Seriously screw this guy, also your grandfather must of been stupid to not have opened his own shop. I mean if he's so legendary he could have totally done that.\n\nSo now that you're the slave of a super awesome blacksmith shop what do you do? Well blacksmithery. With hired hands you must forge the mightiest of weapons. Then sell those weapons to the adventures in nearby towns, who have very specific tastes in what they want. You control the stats: Attack, Speed, Accuracy and Magic.\n\nAs the game progresses you have a lot of managing to do. Sending your workers to explore for materials, traveling to the different towns to sell your wares, and researching better weapons. Oh and forging incredible legendary items for the bravest of heroes and adventurers.\n\nThere's a lot of depth in this game and I'm excited to see what else is in store! Also, there's a potato dog!\n\nFor more indie games movies and music check out EarlyAccessMedia.com\n-----------------------\nHi all Angelo here!

This game is incredibly buggy on my system. When I first pressed Esc in game, the game kept trying to open in different resolutions and wouldn't let go of my system. I had to reboot to fix this. Furthermore, pressing Esc after that would cause a brief screen flicker.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, I found the gameplay relatively fun for about 4 hours. After that, it was much too repetitive. Individual characters matter less and less as you reach mid-game and late-game. At first I was very attached to my characters, then I realized that any character could do the same job.\n\nIn-game balance is really what ruined this game for me. The balance was horrific. I would receive impossible quests about half the time, and the other half, I would receive incredibly easy quests. I'm talking about quests that couldn't be completed at end-game or quests that I could have completed in my first five minutes. Other things like gold gain and gold spending were just weird. I ran out of money two times early game but then I ended the game with millions.\n\nAnyway, the story is fairly fun. Straightforward and simple, but not annoying. I liked it.\n\nOverall I give this game a 5/10. Buy it if it's on sale but not worth $15.","July 19, 2015","false","8.2"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

I truly enjoy the game, but the save function is horribly buggy. Saving manually corrupts the save file more often than not and the autosave has issues as well. When I load my late year 6 autosave, I somehow end up in early year 2. So for roughly 4 hours the autosave was updating the stats shown on the save file in the load screen, but didn't touch the actual contents of what gets loaded, meaning that it not only screws you out of hours of gameplay, but you won't find out until you've already loaded.","July 14, 2015","false","16.3"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","1"

A Weapon Shop?! heavily reminds me of Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale, another game about selling weapons/items to adventurers.\n\nNow depending on what you want in a "management" game, I would choose between this game and Recettear.\n\nHoly Potatoes! A Weapon Shop?! is a game where you are a potato man, who's looking to forge weapons to sell to heroes/heroines. That's it. You forge a weapon, pick a main stat, and sell it to those who value the weapon type (sword, wand, daggar, axe, etc) and main weapon stat (Attack, speed, accuracy, and magic). After a few hours of playing, I've found the game to be...lacking. You can explore planets to find materials, in which to use to research newer kinds of weapons. Along the way you hire smiths to help you in forging these weapons. This game also goes along the lines of games like Game Dev Tycoon.\n\nEarlier I mentioned a game called Recettear. I admit that Holy Potatoes has a more-appealing art and sound style, BUT! Recettear is just more fun. Recettear is a game in which you also sell weapons, but there's another side to the game where you can take weapons and items you forge to go on a mini-game of exploration in dungeons. It's a bit of a side-action game to the game's management skills. Also, if you are not a fan of anime or japanese voice acting, Recettear isn't the game for you.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game, but maybe wait until it's on sale.","October 16, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact I like it so much that I just have to post this review because I can only recommend it.\n\nThe gameplay follows a simple idea, the player owns a blacksmith shop and forges weapons for heroes who gain experience and tell their mom, friends and cat about the store which in turn leads to new shop upgrades, customers and regions. It’s easy to get into but the difficulty does increase with the shop level and failure can occur. Holy Potatoes had me hooked from the beginning and I might be a tiny bit addicted to it already.\n\nI haven’t completed the game yet but so far I’m very intrigued by the plot, the story is quirky and funny but also has some serious moments. The art style is very unique; clear lines and bright colors make the game easy on the eyes and convey a happy atmosphere at the same time. Although there is no voice acting emotions are clearly shown through the expressions and sounds the characters have and they make them extremely likeable.\n\nIt’s nice to look at and a lot of fun to play, I recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing, well-made management game.","August 25, 2015","true","32.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A Weapon Shop?!" is a time management game. You play as a potato that inherited a weapon shop from his grandfather. With the help of Agent 46, that owns the bigger part of the shop (99.9% to be exact) you produce weapons, sell them, repeat. Alright, so it's not that easy, you have to manage your resources, upgrade your shop, send your workers on vacations, explore the land, level up your customers (yeah) and do a thousand other things.\n\nI said earlier that Agent 46 will help you, right? I lied. He just shows up in your door from time to time and asks you to get him money, or, should I say $purds, because that's the currency in the game.\n\nAs for the forging of weapons, you get a lot of categories that you can choose from (sword, dagger, axe, pistol, wand, just to name a few). Every weapon has 4 stats (attack, speed, accuracy, magic) that grow faster or slower, depends on the weapon type. Your customers are wandering heroes, that level up with every weapon they buy from you. They all have different weapon and stat preferences, so one hero may like accurate and magical bows, and other may like speedy and high-damage swords. The more the weapon you forged suits them, the more they will pay for it.\n\nThe game is packed with humorous refences to popculture. One of your first smiths is named Bulk Bogan, there is a hero named Claude that wants a really big sword, you can sing Baby, by JB to one of your smiths when they are feeling down, you can forge a bow named "RavenClaw", et cetera, et cetera.\n\nThere is a lot more to this game that I haven't listed, so if you think that you'll enjoy the game, get it now and experience the ehm.. full experience.\n\n","August 25, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The humble beginnings of opening your own shop, learning how to smith weapons, and the adorable characters, next thing you know you are researching, selling, smithing like crazy and 3 hours have gone by. Its no longer 9pm, its 11:30pm. So you say you'll only play another half an hour...until you meet a legendary hero and are adament about creating his legendary weapon and take 4-5 tries, working EXP on your smiths after each failure before retrying again.\n\nThis game was a really really cute store/economy game. Gotta balance worker happieness, training level, exp of your customers, and most of all, the $pud.\n\nEasy, hard to take breaks from, it has me totally captivated and will have you too. For getting it on sale I am overwhelmed with how awesome this game is, even for full price its definitley worth is.","December 27, 2015","true","18.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fun and addictive and the jokes and references are endearing. However, sadly, it loses its touch as the game progresses, all of the objectives become fame based and there's nothing to do once you've unlocked all of the areas. Gets very repetitive and boring when you've spent as long on it as I have. The Golden Hammer Awards are too easy, there's no point in having the bribe system. There's not enough stuff the spend $tarch on towards the end either, I have over $2million and nothing to do with it. These are all problems with the late game, it's very fun working out how to optimise your smiths etc in the beginning. Definitely worth the price for what you get.","January 1","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For the first two worlds you're like "yeah! this is fun!" But then you start becomming overleveled and craft super OP weapons. You have a bunch of money stashed aside, and everything becomes a bit more repetitive. There's not much new material added to the game and it gets boring. But the plot of this game is cute and funny! This whole game is super cute. I still haven't done the DLC yet so I'll have to update once I do.","December 27, 2015","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A Weapon Shop?! is a simulation game with a lot more character than substance. The game itself is overflowing with pop culture refrences and humor, all tied together through the simple management element. The gameplay gets repetitive fast, and this is only furthered by the fact that later on the objectives become very grindy. The mobile-influenced UI is very simple, and although it was visually appealing it occasionally makes you go through a bit too many sub-menus. Next, the game starts with you having a very limited amount of smiths, which makes the early hours a bit slow. Overall it's a solid game with charm and style, but the price is a bit steep.

A Weapon Shop?!" is a time management game. You play as a potato that inherited a weapon shop from his grandfather. With the help of Agent 46, that owns the bigger part of the shop (99.9% to be exact) you produce weapons, sell them, repeat. Alright, so it's not that easy, you have to manage your resources, upgrade your shop, send your workers on vacations, explore the land, level up your customers (yeah) and do a thousand other things.\n\nI said earlier that Agent 46 will help you, right? I lied. He just shows up in your door from time to time and asks you to get him money, or, should I say $purds, because that's the currency in the game.\n\nAs for the forging of weapons, you get a lot of categories that you can choose from (sword, dagger, axe, pistol, wand, just to name a few). Every weapon has 4 stats (attack, speed, accuracy, magic) that grow faster or slower, depends on the weapon type. Your customers are wandering heroes, that level up with every weapon they buy from you. They all have different weapon and stat preferences, so one hero may like accurate and magical bows, and other may like speedy and high-damage swords. The more the weapon you forged suits them, the more they will pay for it.\n\nThe game is packed with humorous refences to popculture. One of your first smiths is named Bulk Bogan, there is a hero named Claude that wants a really big sword, you can sing Baby, by JB to one of your smiths when they are feeling down, you can forge a bow named "RavenClaw", et cetera, et cetera.\n\nThere is a lot more to this game that I haven't listed, so if you think that you'll enjoy the game, get it now and experience the ehm.. full experience.\n\n","August 25, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's filled with references and ester eggs, witch adds a special flavor to the positively childish humor of the game.\n\nIMO Pros:\n- pretty forgiving,yet challanging enough management game: good for casual short bursts of playing, yet complex enough to be interesting and enjoyable on a single long run; ideal to those who love the genre, but don't want to wrap their heads around every little hidden aspects of the game mechanics to progress\n- charming style (which not vary during the game - remains silly and loveable all the way throught)\n- lots of popculture cameos\n- funny caraters and comments\n- overall good gameplay\n- the "Golden Hammer Awards" is a quite nice addition\n- It has some replayablity and a dlc with a shorter, side-campaing\n- It's very child-friendly as well\n\nAnd there are some IMO Cons:\n- even though the music is fitting, can be a little monotone, repetitive after a few tens of minutes\n- if you have experience with management games, you will figure out pretty quickly how the mechanics working. And if you patient enough you can eventually "break" the game. (I managed to gather a team wich was capable to powersmith weapons with 40000 on one stat, while all the request were around 10k)","March 28","true","35.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very easy to master, takes about 8-12 hours to complete the first time around and it leaves you with basically nothing to do once it ends.\n\nPro: Art style, story, little happy potato sounds, potato puns, funny characters.\nCons: Endless menu cycling, too easy, no end game content, fairly useless to research weapons, no scaling of complexity.\n\nBasically the entire game all you will be doing is crafting a weapon with two stats on it. That's it. If a guy wants a "speed attack axe" then you just make an axe with all your guys working on speed and attack. Then he will pay you a crazy price for it and you win. This never changes or grows in complexity, which is a bit of a shame. It feels like the game ends before it fully develops the whole weapon shop mechanic.\n\nThat said the game is just adorable and enjoyable, highly recommend anyone plays through this. Hopefully they make a sequel with more depth.","January 10","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A Weapon Shop?! is a simulation game with a lot more character than substance. The game itself is overflowing with pop culture refrences and humor, all tied together through the simple management element. The gameplay gets repetitive fast, and this is only furthered by the fact that later on the objectives become very grindy. The mobile-influenced UI is very simple, and although it was visually appealing it occasionally makes you go through a bit too many sub-menus. Next, the game starts with you having a very limited amount of smiths, which makes the early hours a bit slow. Overall it's a solid game with charm and style, but the price is a bit steep.

A Weapon Shop?!" is a cute management simulation very very similar to the likes of Game Dev tycoon. You manage employees which specialize in certain traits (attack, speed, accuracy and magic) which directly contribute to the overall 'quality' of the weapon you are producing. You can level up the employees, train them, and fire them as well. To suit your needs, you can have them explore, research new weapons, and work towards your weapon creation. You can purchase upgrades to your office, but I found the selection to be quite limited. One issue I had with the game was the amount of required micromanagement the employees needed after doing ANYTHING outside the office (explore, train, vacation, buy/sell). I thought a better way of automatically assigning 8+ employees to default office spots was dearly needed.\n\nThe story is minimal, but the developers put a lot of effort into incorporating a parody of a lot of popular people and game characters into the game/story. This added a lot of enjoyable flavor to the game.\n\nThe aesthetics felt like a mobile game and a great deal of 'flashy' eye catching effects commonly used in mobile games were employed in this game.\n\nThe game unfortunately becomes monotonous after the second level-New area, explore, create weapons until you get more tickets, unlock new area, explore, create weapons until you get more tickets, repeat. This coupled with the lack of the much needed 'smart management' of employees gives this game a 7/10. It is an enjoyable management simulator, which the fun-ness factor wears thin after the first hour of play.","March 20","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/recommended/363600/","Seranth","Seranth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/","1189 products in account","A pretty simple store management game where you make and sell weapons. Decent graphics, a basic story to tie things together and full of pop/gaming culture references.\n\nYou start out with access to one area that has a few customers that want to buy your weapons. These customers are static and always want a certain type of weapon with certain stats. When you make a weapon, you choose what stats to give it by moving your smiths around to one of the four stations. There's a station for each stat: attack, accuracy, speed and magic (I learned them as red, blue, green and yellow because stats have no difference to you). The higher the stat a weapon has, the more money it sells for and the more XP the customer gets.\n\nYou can make new weapons by researching them (which consumes relics and uses a smith) and the new weapons usually have better stat growths, which leads to higher sale prices and customer XP.\n\nOnce I understood the mechanics it wasn't too hard to start a new game, follow the pattern/procedure I wanted, and repeat until everything was completed and I jumped ahead of the difficulty curve.\n\nYou don't want smiths to gain unused levels because it also increases their wages (at least until you have too much money to know what to do with it). I picked one person to be my dedicated explorer and another to be my dedicated salesperson. Also, to keep wages in check, I didn't upgrade the class of my explorer (because they were on constant exploration duty).\n\nThe simplest flow is to create batches of 3 weapons for customers in the same area then send your merchant to sell them all at once.\n\nEventually, everything flowed smoothly and the money came flowing in. My explorer gave me the materials, relics and enchantments needed to make great weapons, the weapons sold for a lot of money, and the money was used to pay for maintenance, upgrades and as a money buffer for the next world.\n\nOther notes:\nMake sure to complete the objectives at the top-right of the screen. They're necessary to advance the plot and unlock new areas.\nAs far as I can tell, there isn't any reason to rush to the next world so make sure to save enough money before entering the next world. You'll use the money to buy upgrades.\nIf you're ahead of the difficulty curve, contracts and random requests are generally a waste of time because they don't give customer XP. However, if you're in dire need of cash they're a decent way to get that little extra to pay your smiths at the end of the month.\nWhen you input the razer promo code for the weapon, you might want to be in a certain world (probably the final world) because I used the code right away and couldn't research it, possibly because I didn't have access to the later-tier relics. It didn't let me research it in the later worlds and I couldn't input the code again.\nWorth a look if you like clickers and store-management/stat maximizing games.","April 9","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's charming, cheerful and has a rewarding slightly addictive gameplay. It's filled with references and ester eggs, witch adds a special flavor to the positively childish humor of the game.\n\nIMO Pros:\n- pretty forgiving,yet challanging enough management game: good for casual short bursts of playing, yet complex enough to be interesting and enjoyable on a single long run; ideal to those who love the genre, but don't want to wrap their heads around every little hidden aspects of the game mechanics to progress\n- charming style (which not vary during the game - remains silly and loveable all the way throught)\n- lots of popculture cameos\n- funny caraters and comments\n- overall good gameplay\n- the "Golden Hammer Awards" is a quite nice addition\n- It has some replayablity and a dlc with a shorter, side-campaing\n- It's very child-friendly as well\n\nAnd there are some IMO Cons:\n- even though the music is fitting, can be a little monotone, repetitive after a few tens of minutes\n- if you have experience with management games, you will figure out pretty quickly how the mechanics working. And if you patient enough you can eventually "break" the game.

Decent graphics, a basic story to tie things together and full of pop/gaming culture references.\n\nYou start out with access to one area that has a few customers that want to buy your weapons. These customers are static and always want a certain type of weapon with certain stats. When you make a weapon, you choose what stats to give it by moving your smiths around to one of the four stations. There's a station for each stat: attack, accuracy, speed and magic (I learned them as red, blue, green and yellow because stats have no difference to you). The higher the stat a weapon has, the more money it sells for and the more XP the customer gets.\n\nYou can make new weapons by researching them (which consumes relics and uses a smith) and the new weapons usually have better stat growths, which leads to higher sale prices and customer XP.\n\nOnce I understood the mechanics it wasn't too hard to start a new game, follow the pattern/procedure I wanted, and repeat until everything was completed and I jumped ahead of the difficulty curve.\n\nYou don't want smiths to gain unused levels because it also increases their wages (at least until you have too much money to know what to do with it). I picked one person to be my dedicated explorer and another to be my dedicated salesperson. Also, to keep wages in check, I didn't upgrade the class of my explorer (because they were on constant exploration duty).\n\nThe simplest flow is to create batches of 3 weapons for customers in the same area then send your merchant to sell them all at once.\n\nEventually, everything flowed smoothly and the money came flowing in. My explorer gave me the materials, relics and enchantments needed to make great weapons, the weapons sold for a lot of money, and the money was used to pay for maintenance, upgrades and as a money buffer for the next world.\n\nOther notes:\nMake sure to complete the objectives at the top-right of the screen. They're necessary to advance the plot and unlock new areas.\nAs far as I can tell, there isn't any reason to rush to the next world so make sure to save enough money before entering the next world. You'll use the money to buy upgrades.\nIf you're ahead of the difficulty curve, contracts and random requests are generally a waste of time because they don't give customer XP. However, if you're in dire need of cash they're a decent way to get that little extra to pay your smiths at the end of the month.\nWhen you input the razer promo code for the weapon, you might want to be in a certain world (probably the final world) because I used the code right away and couldn't research it, possibly because I didn't have access to the later-tier relics. It didn't let me research it in the later worlds and I couldn't input the code again.\nWorth a look if you like clickers and store-management/stat maximizing games.","April 9","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead of being a game studio making games, you have a weapon shop where you make weapons and everybody is a potato for some reason. You have four workstations and each has a different focus, being strength,accuracy,speed and magic. You assign your workers to the station that matches their skills, pick a weapon to craft and then craft it. Then you send one of them off to sell the crafted weapons. Thats pretty much the majority of the gameplay.\n\nThere are other things to do with your workers like send them off to explore the different available areas for materials and send them on holiday or training but the bulk of it is just crafting weapons. While the game is fun for the first hour or two it turns into a massive grind later on where it just becomes a process of researching and crafting weapons to sell to get your profits and fame up. As theres little else to do, that quickly gets really boring. It just got to a point where I couldnt take the repetitive grind anymore and stopped playing.\n\nGood points:\n-the game looks pretty good with its cute cartoon graphics and they fit the game quite well\n-the game at least has a wide variety of weapons to research and craft\n\nBad points:\n- the gameplay is just too repetitive and gets very grindy later on. It started to feel more like work than a fun game to play.\n-I didnt really like the games humour and with all the pop culture references and memes it feels a bit forced\n- this game feels like it would be better suited as a mobile game than a PC game","May 29","false","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

None of which has any real added gameplay to it, they just kind of get sent by you and return with items/results.\nThis game could only really appeal to fans of the clicker/idle game genre.\n\nThanks for reading.","June 5","false","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
