Had a very "God of War" feel to the game with multiplayer elements that I would describe as being closer to Dark Souls than anything. It isn't quite single player, but it isn't quite an MMORPG or cooperative multiplayer either. Dark Souls allows you to influence the play of others, but you rarely directly intrevene and the same seems to be said of this game.\n\nHere comes the awful part: The developers, or lack of. This isn't just me. The whole community is in an uproar about the situation, and it has been going on for months now. Literally.\nThe game has had rollbacks where you lose all your uncovered map, waypoints, and storyline progression. You start back at the tutorial screen, randomly, because it blanks out everything except your character's level and gear. People who've spent money on the game aren't getting refunds. They're just asking for patiences. Months worth of it. I only put 10 hours of gameplay in before I was rolled back to the beginning.\nSome people have put much more.\nThis game would be great if it had any form of assistance. There isn't even a way to contact customer support within the game. You are on your own.\n\nPlay at your own risk.","July 1, 2015","false","28.1"," 364 of 402 people (91%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","91","364","402","17","3"

Darksouls and maybe a few other action RPG type games play heavy influence.  You are usually alone but you can often see other players in their own worlds and can interact with them indirectly, like sending monsters into their realm or if they are on your side, sending a buff to their stats or other gift.  Combat is rewarding and requires a bit of skill which translates to you being able to technically take on better equiped opponents with skill and clever manipulation of the enviroment.  You can even gather villagers who will climb onto you and fight with you.  It gives you some interesting ways to play and win though the enemies you face will often be tough opponents and fight well.\n\nThe problem is that you need to rely on a server which fails frequently.  You will often lose progress and the game sometimes loads information from the server wrong and freezes up.  The devs seem to be either procrastinating or just gone.  I don't know what happened but it apparently seems that they have all but abandoned the game, and even that may not be far off.\n\nThe game is dying and everyone is angry about it but there is ultimately nothing we can really do if the devs have lost their will to work on it.

You are supposedly a 100ft tall demigod but grass is as tall as your kneecaps and the scale of everything else in general just makes you scratch your head.  Most enemies look like they've been copy pasted from the "scrapped/uninspired" folder of Brutal Legends' Dev team.\n\nCombat is just awful, a spam fest of x and y or whichever key binding you happen to have the commands assigned to,theres no dodge, instead you have a "dash" which doesn't provide the slightest bit of invincibility and is literally your character taking two steps really quickly so theres no distance.but you can spam it to stupid degrees in which you can just cheese every boss and enemy if you picked the right starting God to serve. Running just the right distance from enemies starts your regeneration but your enemies stay injured. So you end up in a frat -boy slugfest for 30 seconds, literally slink off (oh you're dying no rush, just keep limping in that direction) and just finish off the scragglers like a dirt bag. Spamming frozen spells at bosses while running circles is the mans' way of handling bosses.\n\nTheres PVP but its the dumbest concept of PVP. You face AI opponents when you invade or get invaded, or while adventuring through the levels if someone serving a different god walks into the same level you can cast spells to send enemies into each others worlds via single use spells that you find in chests or can buy in the shop.\n\nThe forge is the oddest feature.Gear you FIND is worn down to 35% durability or less. Which in most games that'd be an hour or two of use. 35% is about 10 minutes in Ascend. This game has a way of remedying the issue by either repairing and paying a hefty sum, upgrading and getting the repair for an even more considerable sum, or going to a forge. The forge is free, the forge has a disclaimer that no matter how broken your gear it will all be fixed in an hours time. The forge also claims you can log out while using it and all of your gear will be repaired (in at most an hours time) when you return. That part of the forge has never worked. most instances my gear is repaired by the time I'm done watching a youtube video or two on my phone. To which I ask: Why bother? The durability is more agitating than compelling. I guess to encourage taking breaks? It feels like the cow-clicker energy system of farmville and the like but its so weirdly implemented. According to patch notes/forums it use to actually take hours. So why bother at all?\n\nThe shop is the worst part of this game. You can find rares, epics, legendaries and the like but you always have to give it up, even when you aren't really ready to. Hit lvl 20 for the first time? Down the toilet with everything. Souls is what you use to buy upgrades, buy items/gear, buy spells, and the lot. The issue is that upon ascending ( think prestige but even duller) enough of characters lets you reach the level cap of 60. Then you transcend. which wipes ALL of your spell upgrades which are steep. STEEP. All you keep are achievement badges and souls. You can purchase upgrades with in game currency to keep a few more items but you still have to give up so much. Don't want to start from scratch? Time to flush away some souls. Beat that AI driven character to a pulp? Here spend souls. Did you sneeze? SPEND SOULS\n\nThe ever present ability to buy whatever whenever is pressed into your face,every time you die, everytime you win, everytime your gear breaks, and everytime you open the menu. Its all the game wants you to look at. All gear is paid for via the ingame currency of souls. Souls can be bought with a credit card number.\n\nA minimal amount of research reveals this. SO you end up hearing "BUY IT YOU SUCKER, BUY IT" in your mind.The first 8 characters aren't worth putting a dime towards. It sure ain't worth the 10 hours I put into it.","October 2, 2014","false","10.3"," 170 of 223 people (76%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","76","170","223","15","2"

You spawn in as a giant demi-god surrounded by humans worshipping you.  Damn straight!  Off to a good start I'd say.\n\nGame has three gods in which to serve and serving each grants you access to different dungeons and powers.  Plus you have the option to switch every 5 levels!  Once you hit max level... you start again, getting to choose what items/powers you want to carry over into your new life.  Bam rinse repeat.  Great time burner and easy to play, with a fun combat system with combos and spells.  Big monsters... even some you will literally have to climb up.\n\nMulti-player aspect?  Near non-existant.  You are able to see other players, but they appear as ghosts and you cannot directly interact with them.  Doesn't mean you can't jack them up and kill them!  You can banish your enemies straight to them, or simply create a spawner in their 'world' and watch your creatures go hard.  You can also help others out with blessings.  But what's the fun in that...\n\nFor those of you (and yes.. there are so many of you)  who whine and complain about this being a money scam and how you have to pay-to-play..  Just do us all a favor and Stfu.  Learn how to play games.  The option to buy stuff will always be there in free games.  They got bills to pay too!

You control a titan that you can customize (a few faces here and there, some of it is microtransactions), choose a following, between Dark, Light and Void. You can take over a village and have a bunch of dudes on your back as followers, and you can throw said dudes wherever you want. As for the multiplayer aspect, though it is light in implementation, favouring a more asynchronous approach. You can send curses and blessings to other players, there is leaderboards, etc.\nThis is one of the few free-to-play games that doesn't forcefeed microtransactions down your throat, despite them being quite fair and broad. You can buy souls for real world money (you start off with 3000 initially), or you can grind your way through the game to earn them.\n\nKeep in mind that this game requires an internet connection at all times due to the asynch multiplayer, leaderboards and game data.\nBut for a free game that was also free on Xbox 360, it's an impressive game so far.","May 20, 2014","true","1.8"," 150 of 214 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","150","214","0","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197961016971/recommended/233630/","76561197961016971","SaviorSelph","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197961016971/","346 products in account","This will be lengthy and a little in depth, you will also most likely save yourself the time of downloading it/installing it/playing it/uninstalling it.\n\nTo quickly generalize the game, it is much like God of War: Ascension(more so the multiplayer portion is what I was reminded of in the sense that each weapon has its own set of combo moves albeit slightly limiting when compared to singleplayer game, you also pick an alignment/god that defines your set of spells) and with a little Dark Souls mixed in(kill things for souls, spend them to upgrade, some boss fights are lengthy and there is some emphasis on blocking and dodging attacks, invading other player's worlds).\n\nHas a lot of pay to win elements to it. Sure everything can be bought with currency you earn from playing but the prices are often times set so high, that there is no realistic way to buy them other than with your wallet or by investing a lot of time. Chances are if you go the route of investing your time instead, you will have leveled up plenty and be shown other, better items, that are also priced very high.\n\nIt may also be worth mentioning that this was previously a console game and the menus really reflect this. Often times navigating through the menus just doesn't make sense on a keyboard and mouse or the buttons for you to click on are misaligned, because of this I bought upgrades I didn't intend to buy and sold a lot of items I meant to equip instead. The way the map functioned was also frustrating, if I was using a controller it would have made sense (to try and clarify a bit, instead of just putting your mouse over an icon on the map that you have interest in, you instead have to grab the entire map and shift everything until the icon you are insterested in, is in the center of the screen, WHY!?!).\n\nSome elements of the game could have also been explained a lot more clearly, for example ascending. I still have plenty of questions on how it works but the game explained almost nothing about this apprently important aspect of the game. I instead had to look up wiki's and guides on it, only to discover I should have ascended at level 5 and if I ascended any later I would be missing out on some perks in the late game (you get a passive each time you ascend but cannot ascend once you are at level cap). I was already past level 5 at the time since the game gave no indication that it's better to do this sooner. Now on to explain what ascending is since the game does very little to explain this. If you ascend, the game more or less takes a snapshot of everything that makes up your character such as gears/spells/etc. and turns it into a npc that invades other players worlds, which can earn you a tiny amount of in game currency if successful (it wont be, as it will die a lot, unless of course you ascended with really powerful gear, aka used your wallet). Cool concept until you realize how much the game wants you to spend money at this point, ascending destroys your character and you make a new one(from what I can tell your new character starts 5 levels back, not sure why you go back 5 levels other than to artificially extend the game?). Part of the ascension process allows you to keep 1 piece of gear, so naturally you hold on to your best piece, every character going forward will have access to this item, of course you can preserve more items by paying to keep each one. Also part of new character creation process involves showing you all the powerful items you could buy instead! So to summarize ascending is destroying your character to in turn rollback 5 or so levels, lose your gear unless you choose to pay to save it or pay and buy new gear which you will then want to pay to save on your next ascension.\n\nShortly after my first ascension I had started one of the tougher boss fights (boss had a life pool that would have taken a couple hundred hits to kill, less if I bought nice gear though!). The boss felt glitchy all across the board. I initially fought it as intended, I would dodge and block when possible but the boss would frequently do quick 180's and hit me instantly, leaving little room to react. Challenge is nice if it feels fair, but having the constant thought in the back of my head that this challenge would not exist if I had chosen pay to win options is not fun, then add on top of that that the fight is buggy. Eventually I discovered a set of stairs on the edge of the designated fight area where I could freely cast spells and the boss would just sit and stare at me while he slowly died. Rather than spend 20 minutes abusing a glitch to kill the boss I instead wrote this review.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hellbeholder/recommended/233630/","Hellbeholder","Hellbeholder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hellbeholder/","426 products in account","ATTENTION! Detailed Review and Beginner Tips up ahead!\n\n(At first, don't believe the negative reviews with 2-3 hrs playtime. I'm sorry to say but they simply don't know how the game works and it seems these players don't have enough patience to try some things out before ranting about a game. It is NOT p2w.)\n\nThis game is awesome!\n"Ascend: Hand of Kul" is an Action RPG which takes place in a brutal fantasy world, in which the humans are the tiniest creatures. You play as a so called 'Caos', summoned giant warriors, who are the champions of the new three gods, Darkness, Void and Light. Capable of using magic and any weapon, they're deadly beserkers, ready to conquer the land for the god they represent. The ultimate goal is to kill Kul theTitan, who reigns the land with terror.\n\nThe time you play is basicly singleplayer, but it got a twist which is comparable to the multiplayer in Dark Souls. While you play, you will see the shadows of other players in your area, who are fighting on their own. With special spells, you can curse or bless them and effect their game with additional enemies or buffs.\n\nAfter reaching a certain level, your Caos will be able to 'ascend'. That means that he sacrifices the most of his equipment and 5 levels to gain a permanent buff, depending on which god you chose. The status, spells and equipment of the Caos in the moment he ascends is saved and will then invade worlds of other players as a NPC to try to conquer their territories. After ascending you can design your Caos anew and choose a different god, which is recomendable to buy other spells.\nEverything in the game is payed with souls. You gain souls mainly by killing enemies with a high combo meter, but also by holding more and more territories. You're able to buy new equipment, spells, buffs and runes but also can upgrade and repair your stuff.\n\nSo, a common complain about this game is, that the equipment of your Caos breaks quite quickly. Which is true. The durability of your armor weakens every time you get hit, while your weapon weakens with every slash you do. You can then spend a lot of souls to repair it. Due to this, many people tempt to say this game is pay2win, because you can spend real money for more souls.\nThat statement is stupid.\n\nThe developers added the forge, with which you can repair your equipment quite quickly and for free. All you have to do, is to use it behind your spawnpoint in your sanctuary. You can even find some in the open areas. The repairs will take some minutes, but you can go AFK in that time and make a little pause or something. (Just make sure that you won't tap out the game, it will then pause and won't repair your stuff.) Even total broken stuff will be fixed 100% in less than 5 minutes. So haters about that can go home.\n\n\nI'm playing this game for 20 hours now and still having a lot of fun.\nThe gameplay might be a little repetative due to the small amount of different enemy types but beeing a F2P game, it's freaking cool! For the end, some beginner tips I figured out:\n\n\n#1 - DON'T WASTE SOULS TO REPAIR YOUR EQUIPMENT!\nUse the forge to do it!\n\n#2 - DON'T BUY NEW EQUIPMENT!\n(On the low levels at least...) You will find enough stuff in chests.\n\n#3 - KNOW YOUR ENEMY!\nEvery enemy type got attack patterns, which can be blocked or evaded.\nA high combo is the key to more souls.\n\n#4 - INVEST IN SPELLS!\nThey are the most usefull thing in combat. You can have 5 equiped and unleash them quickly. Some of them can even interrupt bosses and do alot of damage without beeing in their range.\n\n#5 - Have MORE THAN ONE WEAPON when entering a catacomb!\nCatacombs are like dungeons, long and dangerous. It is quite certain that one of\nyour weapons will break in it, so have backup.\n\n#6 - DON'T TAKE DARKNESS FIRST!\nIt might be tempting to ally with the sexy evil goddess first, but she got the worst starter spells.\nFor Void beeing the god of magic, he got the most and more powerfull spells. You might want to ally with him in the beginning to get the first two spells for free, you can change the god later anyway.\n\n\nSo yeah, I guess those are the most usefull tips.\n\nI hope you liked my detailed opinion on the game!\nTry it out, it's for free!","June 15, 2014","true","41.9"," 72 of 94 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","72","94","0","0"

The combat is awesome, the customization is just endless, the armor and weapons look AWESOME. The idea of actually being a giant with humans devoted to you is brilliant. Why am I rating it negatively? Pay to win. At the beginning it prolonged it by giving you 50k souls to spend (which you waste half of at the beginning) so you wouldn't need souls. But when you get low on souls, everything turns to ♥♥♥♥. Let's put it like this, if you were to continuously fight a single mob over and over and over again, you would lose souls. Why? They damage your armor extrememly fast, so it makes you repair every half an hour or so. Repairing costs near 10k souls for some armor/ weapons, and each mob gives you about 5 souls. Eventually everything of yours will be broken and you will have no souls left, making you pay to get more so you can repeat the process. Anyone who says it's not P2W is just kidding themselves.\n\nThe mobs are also extremely easy (the witch doctors are just annoying). They die in a couple of hits, but then suddenly you are pitted against ogres, which take off a quarter of your health in a couple swings and knock you down so you can't do anything while they are demolishing you. They also have super high health. To actually fight them you need better items, which means more money spent for souls!\n\nI would pay money for this game if they were to just get rid of this P2W ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.","August 17, 2015","false","10.5"," 70 of 92 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","70","92","3","0"

The main complaint that most people have about this game is that it is 'pay2play'. This is complete rubbish; I have racked up a fair few hours and have not paid a penny. If your weapons/ armour break you can repair them instantly for a small fee, repair them for free over a few hours (as long as they are not completely broken) or just find some new stuff in chests. Simple money managemwnt is important, so those people who don't plan ahead will fail in the first 45 minutes, but simple perseverance can restore you. When my weapon first broke, I just fought with a weaker starter blade, which was challenging, but got me enough sould to repair my other weapon. It isn't that hard. Combat is entertaining, although the enemies can become repetetive, and a simple loot system makes dungeon crawling rewarding. The peculiar player vs player action is enjoyable, although occasionally irritating- particularly when idiots on your own team attack you- and gives ASCEND a unique twist. A thoroughly enjoyable game of a unique style with good action and a respectable storyline, ASCEND is a great game from a  smally company that I would certainly recommend. Besides, it's free, so what is there to lose?","March 11, 2015","true","14.9"," 49 of 64 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","49","64","3","0"

The gameplay isn't very deep, but it all fits together coherently into a playable and somewhat fun game, and you don't have to play diddly squat for it.\n\nIt's defiantely worth giving a try because by no means is it a bad game, as it's paywall and repeative gameplay are it's only negative faults.

The fact that you can serve the god of your choice is awesome, I've never seen it in a game before. The controls and everything else are fine but I have one problem that holds the game back  from being a brilliant game. For the first couple of hours, the game is a good bit of fun, killing things, getting new items and other things, but the fun stops when you get to the first proper boss fight. The boss is way too overpowered and I feel that you need to pay money to get good enough items to defeat the boss. The thing that got me the most was the fact that when you finally kill the boss after about 30 minutes of fighting, the boss regenerates about two thirds of its health and you feel as if you're back where you started. I know the game is in beta and I know this may be an issue they may fix, but if they're going to make a game pay to win, then it's a waste of most people's time who just want to have a little bit of fun with it.","May 23, 2014","false","15.1"," 43 of 66 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","43","66","0","11"

It does have a few interesting ideas with player interaction and the different gods, but they take a pretty far back seat to the flaws of the game.\n\nAll the equipment you find is heavily damaged and wears out quickly, requiring frequent repairs.  What little money you gain from playing is quickly sunk into equipment repairs if you want to use any piece for more than 10 minutes.  Never mind that you need to use that same currency to upgrade your spells.\n\nCombat is slow and clunky, with only two simple attack moves, block, dash, and spells.  Every hit you take and many of the attacks you block will stagger you, yet enemies are only staggered at random and often can recover and attack you before you can land another attack.  Blocking seems to be instant so it doesn't have to wait for your previous action to finish, but it just leads to spamming block all the time which is pretty poor design if you ask me.  But hey, you can buy boosts to attack faster to make the combat easier!\n\nThis game looked interesting and I wanted to enjoy it, but it's just another f2p grind.

I really like this game, I played it before it came on Steam, and its an awseome game. On my Steam account for the game I had 1,000,000 in game credits and so on. The reason I put it down as not recommended because everytime I try and go onto the game I can't access my account because the 'servers' are not currently online... Now I understand that the game is in BETA but they could have warned me before I started putting 6 hours of my life into this version to just lose all of the progress! Now 6 hours isn't alot of time but it was apparentley not well spent because untill the makers decide to sort this problem out then I cannot play the game now. Now before I end let me tell you some things about the game I recommend just be carefull you don't bump into the problem that I have... It has a good storyline unlike other RPG styled games which are impossible to keep up with, yes i'm looking at you Everquest and Dragon Nest, nice combat also and there are 3 factions in the game Good, Void and Evil. Its a great game ,it really is, i'm just annoyed that I cannot continue it and that is why I cannot recommend it in its current state.

This is true with this game as well. So far I have seen that there are numerous glitches/ bugs. Granted they are minor but they are still present.\nCons:\n1. When I dash into a rock in a dugeon, it slings me into the air.\n2. I chose the darkness path. if you use the fourth spell, meteor storm, it will make the enemy chaos stand there vunerable.\n3. This could be a connection error, however, the game does kick me out of the server at random times. Not too often, but it still happens.\n4.The game freezes at important times. These include: Ascending, beating an apex, getting a new power bestowed upon you. Once again not frequent, but kind of annoying.\nPros:\n1. For a free game, it is not too bad of a pay to win. As long as you are smart with your money (souls).\n2. It may be repetative, but the game keeps throwing slight curveballs at you. Such as the bridge scene going to the second apex, or randomly dropping new semi-bosses on you.\n3. The combo system is pretty good, however when you use a spell like fireball it does not always count as a hit.\n4. I love how you can choose a new god to follow after everytime you ascend. Instead of being bound to just one throught the ENTIRE game, like I can't even choose between salad or soup at a restraunt.\n\nOverall it is a pretty fun/great game, which I enjoy. There is always room for improvement in any game, however producers, artists, and programmars are only human. They can't please everyone.

This game just... feels good; I can't NOT recommend it. It's a strange kind of fun that you just have to try out; mind you I am aware that this game is not for everyone. While it does have a story (and one that isn't half bad) its main aspect is killing, viciously and mercilessly tearing your enemies piece by piece with whatever fancy weapon you have equipped. Most of the game is spent doing that; and the time you're not spending killing, you're getting to places where you will be killing. If you can forgive its simplistic AI, its occasional bugs and the strangeness of how it decides to do things. You'll find a pretty swell game, that's worth a few hours of your time and without any risk involved but a short download.\n\nDespite the game's fair option of paying your way through its currency, you can receive the currency just as well as being skilled enough in the game to keep your combos going and learning which way is best to deal with your foes.

But oh well.\n\nAt first its kind of cool, the one unique thing about this game is that you can play a massive big-♥♥♥ giant and command humans to jump on you and fight, but even that is a basically depthless system. You can't 'bless' your human servants, you don't get particularly any stronger by bringing them with you either, it doesn't feel like your gaining any followers of your own like a 'demigod' as the storyline basically sets you up to be.\n\nA system more like being able to interact more with your followers, starting cults in your name, being able to summon them like paladins or demons, things like that would've been good. As it stands, the only reason they are around are as a tack-on.\n\nMagic in this game is like a joke thats been told by Dane Cook - we've seen and heard it before, its boring and it was done better by many, many others. Again, prepare to shell out the souls or the money to get any power in this. After just fifteen minutes of play my first spell might as well have been me sneezing dangerously at the enemy monsters.\n\nMaybe *maybe* this game will be playable in a couple months, but for now if you need something to tide you over and has a darker style then God of War, go get Dante's Inferno.\nDon't need the darker style?\nGo play God of War.","May 24, 2014","false","1.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The brawler featuring a singleplayer with - upcoming - co-op and pvp, with different "dimensions" you fight for control over with other players. At this moment being - an AI controled characters made by players who "ascended".\nThe "ascension" seems gimmicky and it indeed is, but nevertheless, killing your character, getting a re-roll on experiance levels, getting a high class reward and a powerfull buff on your "reborn" caos is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. Your "old" versions turn into AI who fight to conquer new altars for your chosen god (which you can change after ascending) or defend your current territory you gain souls from.\nThe art design is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome and a class B story background has it charm. No more cartoon ♥♥♥♥ World of Wacraft has cursed the game industry with, please.\nThe graphics are well executed, even if not at the highest grounds by today's standards. Animations are good and the finisher moves are ♥♥♥♥ing sweet (they lack Darksiders' brutality, tough).\nBut don't jump in just yet. It's beta and it feels - not just by the technical difficulties or crashes. The game in current state feels like a pretty, but an empty shell. The real entertainment isn't there yet. You won't play pvp or even co-op with your friend. All interactions with other players boil down into cursing or blessing them (as on the one map there are up to 4 ghosts of players), which is just dickish thing to do and fighting with AI versions of them. Their implementation may end with a failure, as the capability of your characters solely depends on your gear, runes and spell upgrades you acquire with souls, the in-game currency getting from chests, selling trash loot, killing creeps and controlled altars. Its income is pretty slow and you will spend it mostly on repairing your gear. Yeah, you get it: you can buy a ♥♥♥♥-load of souls with real money and get the ♥♥♥♥ advantage over others. The more you pay, the more you stomp. The pay-to-win is showing even now, without the co-op and the real pvp. Just check th forums for complaints on AI caoses stomping other players with 1 or 2 hits, being even on lower exp. levels. If the issue will last unresolved, you really don't want to play this game; look at every other game pay-to-win was the only way to do anything.\nWhat else? A pve gameplay is ♥♥♥♥ing boring. The tougher enemies are HP bloated and are just irritiating to fight. Indirect, yet accurate hits, locking your character with them indirect hits you were sure do dodge, tricky tactics depending on dash attacks and running around pointlessly. They don't drop anything and an accomplishment of defeating an ogre is none. Instead of "♥♥♥♥ yes, the big guy again, the fun!" you had in Darksiders, you say to yourself "♥♥♥♥ no, THIS GUY again". You don't want to waste your time on them and you will soon learn to avoid them and run through them. The combat system itself is still a bit wonky and needs polishing. But it's the beta.\n\nJust wait.","July 14, 2014","false","6.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

The lack of variety of dungeons and enemies may make the game look repetitive and dull, but I really enjoyed it even with these flaws. The game crashed on me a couple of times but that as well may be my system's fault, however, expect some bugs. I think the game is going in a right direction an if they will enhance the multiplayer system, the game would be almost perfect. The story is kind of non-existent (although with such a gameplay you probably won't miss it), but the idea of the game overall is great. As for this being pay-to-win, I really don't know what to say. If you do all dungeons on a daily basis, you are bound to find really good items which are comparable with the ones from shop (if not even better), so it's unlikely one will be very far behind in the matter of gears. For instance, I found a helm of level 10 which was better than the best helm in the shop which was level 13. The rate of getting souls is decent and it depends on your skill. As you get more combo hits, your multiplier for getting souls will rise, so if you manage to do a lot if hitting without getting damaged (you can block and not interrupt combo), then you may get a lot of souls. To exemplify, I got about 60.000 souls in my playtime. The repairs can be a pain in the ♥♥♥, but I read a tip saying that one should use the lesser quality items they find until they break (as they can be selled at the same price even broken) and use their main gear only at invasion or against bosses. Anyway, had a great time playing the game and since it's free to play, I recommend it to everyone. I'd give it a 8.5/10.","May 26, 2014","true","19.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It takes the idea of taking your champions that you personally build yourself and making them part of your NPC champion army to help out in the crusades.\n\nAscending is status/power\nAscending gives you emblems you can earn a set for each faction which stacks together and allows you to gain great advantages over your opponents. This is really great for people who like to build up a really great character through constantly resetting your character back a few levels or completely with a transcend.\n\nTranscend is new game+\nTranscend resets your guy to level 1 and you start over but you keep souls/elbems this really gives players something to do once they hit the cap. By constantly resetting to level 1 they increase difficulty of the game. Keeping the souls is also a great way for players to have a more smooth sailing the first few times seeing as how you can max alot of spells from the start like seekers which prove very great investments to plow through enemies.","June 15, 2014","true","95.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I will not be playing it again until its business model undergoes a drastic overhaul.\n\nI tried to ignore the accusations of "pay to win" leveed at the game after watching Jim Sterling reveiw the game on his YouTube channel. Since the aesthetic and lore appealed to me, I tried reaaally hard, and for a while I was vindicated. Then three things happened in quick succession.\n\nFirst off, repair prices began to become unreasonable for the quality and utility of my gear, AND I was facing the orge boss, a beast I can not stun, has almost no wind-up, constantly knocks me down, ATTACKS WHILE I AM DOWN, and is more or less DESIGNED to force you to either lame him out with ranged spells - which suck, and never get better unless you're willing to grind for days OR shell out cash, so add that as a FOURTH P2W strike against this increasingly infuriating and nakedly parasitic experience - or prepare to have your gear battered into uselessness as you die over and over.\n\nSo, fueled by incoherant rage against an instentionally badly made boss, I decide to just lame him out by tossing fireballs at his face and chest which do about as much damage as a firm handshake... and then some jerk curses me by sending high-level ranged trash mobs at me. These curses aren't available to ME, so I can't curse him back, and when I look them up... THEY'RE AVAILABLE IN THE STORE FOR AN AMOUNT THAT I MUST PAY FOR IN ORDER TO AFFORD. So, this fragger kills me, forces me to undo twenty minutes of not-fun-but-work spellcraft, and then the final nail is driven into the coffin holding my attention for this game.\n\nI am, in a sense, periodically invaded by other players. Not the players themselves, so far as I've seen, but facimilies using their gear and spells and things. This isn't bad, per say, it's actually quite an interesting conceit when it's done right. Opperative phrase being "when it's done right." I was invaded by a person two levels under me, but they were completely decked out in blue-quality gear, with a defense rating so high that I couldn't even damage them, and so much attack that they killed me in five hits WHICH I COULD NOT BLOCK. These were all items, by the way, that were immediately available IN THE STORE. I was, literally, pay-to-win-ed by someone who forked over money and bought a complete set of stuff in the last 15 minutes.\n\nOh, and yes, my armor and weapons were being battered to all heck during all of this. So even if I did continue to play (which I won't for a very long time), I'd need to fork over money in order to use my gear again.\n\nI am going to enjoy watching this game be uninstalled from my system. Heck, I might even transfer it over to a little thumb stick beforehand so I can ritually purify the game from my life. It'd be a better use of 20 dollars than giving it to the developers who made this game.","May 22, 2014","false","4.7"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Allso when you walk around you see other players shades and if they fighting, proplems is no way to talk to them or write unless you friends on steam. only real way to talk to them is when you invade them and try murdere them to claim a shine that grants hourly soul income.\nLOOT: you get from defeated enemies are somtimes as good or even better then the ones in the shops. only bad thing is they in poor condition, this can be fixed by using souls or go to the forge at spawn, sell eveything els you wont use or is worse, click on the forge and repair. Now you can go out of the game and it will slowly fix all youre items, only bad thing about the free way is it take long time to fix all your gears 100%. Maybe 8+ hours depends damaged the items was, (keeping ekstra items when repairing will slow it down and take longer time)\nSOULS:  are easy to get just kill someone, the stronger they are gives more souls like a enemy player can give 4000-10000 am not quite sure but a bit more then a AI boss. the souls can be used to upgreade youre items like a sword to do more damage and last longer, armor to grant more protections, magic to have shorter cooldown, more damage and can use it more times before needing to wait for the cooldown. the other thing souls can be used for is the shop where you can buy a better armor or wep. i mostly used it to get my dream armor since the upgrades can make it better then most finds, a good armor can keep being the bedst for 10 lvls until you clearly found a better one.\nallso what some people think you need to use money for soul to be first ahead of combat. that are a big no its about what you do and how you handle it. and souls came pretty easy for me just kill and dont run past.\nRUNES: can depends on the god you alligne with like the light god let you get runes that grants crits (twice damage) and speed on mele weps. Allso some runes you can annoy another player with by either having runes that summons 2-4 ex. wolfs into their would where you get a little bit of souls when they hit the player, other way is telepoting nerby enemies out of yours dimension into theirs, the either bug or funny thing is if he have 7 enemies attacking him and you get 4 to him it gives him 11 enemies but if he uses the same spell he can get rid of maybe 4-8.\n\nthe proplems i noticed when i played the game are that somtimes the screens freezes but only very few times (1-2)\nthe soul income was very little, like it dident even matter.\nthe enemies are mostly the same but looks like they alligne with another god even thought they only serves the titan.\ni allso notices that humans (villagers ) can do quite alot of damage if you dont shake them off, it can make invading alot harder if you stand still for too long.\nin invade if you kill the enemy and takes too long to take the alter the enemy will respawn with full health. (invaders dosent respawn the protector does)\nenemies can bug out but it was in the beta if it are out of it now. (as said havent played for a while)\ncombat is geat but it shield enemies are annoying as hell since attacks sometimes dosent even seem to have a effect other then they lose health.\n\nBut i like this game and would rate it 10/10 for a free beta.\nHope you guys find it usefull and sorry for my grammer.\n\n\n\n","June 24, 2014","true","16.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've had a ton of fun with this game, even though most of it is grinding, but this game is meant to be a dungeon crawler like Diablo, but with a different perspective. The only issues i have with this game, (keeping in mind that it is still in beta) is the fact that your armour and weapons don't last long, and there's no dodging mechanic, while you can use the charge attack as a dodge, it's not as quick as rolling around would be. Targeting would also be a plus when fighting large monsters such as the Ogre Brute. And i LOVE the difficulty of the larger monsters.

Ascend: Hand of Kul è a suo modo innovativo, l' idea del personaggio e la sua storia è molto accattivante, ed in alcuni momenti mi ha ricordato "God of War", proprio a causa di questo personaggio sovrumano, quasi un Dio, che combatte contro creature altrettanto mostruose. La grafica è buona, il gameplay abbastanza fluido (qualche crash ogni tanto, ma il gioco è ancora in Beta), la storia un pò ripetitiva. A mio parere un pò complicato da capire il sistema di "Ascensione" e "Trascensione", consiglio a chi volesse provarlo di consultare una guida prima. Non sono ancora arrivato ad alto livello con il mio personaggio, quindi non posso parlarvi molto dell' end game nè del PVP che per ora si basa solo su incursioni o difesa di determinati territori in 1v1 o all' interno dei dungeon. Un' altra cosa che ho notato, forse dovuta sempre al fatto che siamo in Beta, è lo scarso bilanciamento dei nemici. La maggior parte di loro sono praticamente inutili, mentre i boss ti costringono sempre a scappare per recuperare un pò di vita... Su questo si dovrebbe lavorare un pò, ma in fin dei conti... Consigliato!\n\n\nGood game, nice and original story, nice combat visuals and movements... Gets a little repetitive but combining spells with rude force and finishing moves is quite a nice way to get on with the progression of the story."Ascendance" concept can be quite confusing if you haven't read any guide before actually starting to play. It is still in Beta, so we can except some changes over time: i'd suggest to better balance enemies' strenght, 'cause i think they're a bit unbalanced. Most of all are useless dogs or trolls and then there is this huge orc which gets you even if you are in parry stance and throws you away. Don't ever get stucked in a corner of something while facing those 'cause you'll get smashed before you know. Overall, i'm having quite a good time playing this game and i think it can be worthy for you to try ;)","July 3, 2014","true","16.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most of time, upon resuming, the game did not save and often I have to repeat entire boss encounters. At one point I had to redo a dungeon three times on count of this problem. Since the last patch this has not occured yet, so they may have improved netcode stability.\n\nGraphic requirements are still high for a game with average graphics. I notice it still needs optimizations to run more smoothly, and in certain zones the game will have a noticable FPS drop.\n\nUpdated(again): With the new patch, the forge can repair all equipped gear in minutes for free. This is a very great boon to gameplay, and now gear is affordable. I now change my review to a thumbs up.

I came to this game by looking for a good free game and i found a great free game. Before i keep on giving it praise i say it has flaws(as all games do they were that really got me). So this is the main one that i was really ticked off with is the combat. Somewhat i would call this a spam the mouse kind of game, now there is magic you can use by pressing f and there is a number of spells you can use but of course which spells you get depends on which god you choose(i will get into that later). which kinda lets the combat pass but really the combat you are using two to three buttons left and right mouse and f. That disapointed me thinking when i was downloading this game that it would have at least more combat actions. Also the soul and or point system. Now i understand the marketing system i understand (especially since its free) but sometimes your armor or sword would break and you would have to repair it. but if you have like 300 points you probably need 3000 points to repair it in which you would be running around with no helmet or chestplate until you get souls (points) but of course you can buy souls in which you see that like oh ok thats fine i wont buy souls no,. sometimes you are forced to buy souls cause if you are fighting ogres with nothing on and with a crappy knife and you cant kill it cause you have no protection and no sword and you eventually have to pay 20 bucks just to at least get descent stuff. Now thats all i found flaws in. Now PRAISE TO ASCEND. Ascend's story is awesome, i am totally pulled and you can get more info on the area you are in which is so interesting.And the choosing your god idea was great on how choosing what kinda of feats and spells you have. And i love the chests in which i think its a great way other than using souls to get swords armor etc.  And the enemy damage is fair not ridiculous especially the bosses its fair not ridiculous (not saying its challenging).I will give ascend a 7/10 with an outstanding story but with a couple flaws. thanks for reading","July 3, 2014","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I want to love this game as much as I want the freaking dark souls pc port to get fixed. But I can't, I'm sorry, but I can't. First off, lets get the most obvious issue out of the way "Is it pay to win?" Not necesseraly, but if you know steam reviews "not neccessarily" is 1. Spelled incorrectly 2. As much good as saying "The game isn't bad ALL the time". While you can, in theory, leave the payed aspect alone, it doesn't work 100 percent in practice. Prior to writing this review, i came back to the game after about a month, A couple of my lands that i had captured had been taken over by ai controlled champions, this being a main component of the game, which is allowing your high level characters to have the ai control them and capture other lands for you. Now, the request of "This person is 3 levels below me, and is controlled by an ai so let me grind them into the dust as I probably should" (because I'm a monster like that) doesn't SOUND like an unreasonable request, but the game would disagree. The problem is, well, does anyone remember those old programs that ran chess games? They didn't work because they made the absolutely perfect move every time, therefore, it was impossible to beat them, unless you were absolutely perfect as well. The same problem applies here. While this player was 3 levels below me and carried comparitively weaker gear, he won on each of my 5 attempts because it aced every single aspect of the battle. If this had been a human player, I WOULD have ground them into the dust, this problem applies to almost every single enemy except in a different way. The main fodder enemies have the buggery tendency to leap at you, dealing moderate damage, now the problem isnt inherintly there, but the problem is carried by the fact that no matter what you do your weapon swing hits juuuuust short of where you think it was going to land, making killing the teleporting buggers later in the game a right ♥♥♥♥ to deal with. I stopped playing Hand of Kul because of the first boss, well, technicaly not the first but the first of 3 obvious antagonists. That freaking boss fight sent me on a bender and back, it may just be because I'm awful at rpgs but I could not dent that boss for a penny, there were totems in the back of the level that looked like something to do with the boss and the fact that they seemed to suffer damage when I hit them DID NOT HELP. he constantly spawned those fodder enemies i mentioned earlier and with the alignment I had chosen my only aoe attack literaly made flame icicles pop out of the ground, useful for taking out loads of weak enemies but I was dealing with level tens at that point, and since your spells dont level with you they quickly become obselete. Basically, the game starts off fun, but its many flaws slowly sap the fun from it.","May 8, 2015","false","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Light/Void/Dark.\n\nNow go forth to the land below and convert to your cause.\n\nAs you arrive, tiny people from the local village begin to attack. "CONVERT TINY PEOPLE AND WORSHIP ME!" Of course they do because tiny people do not like to be stomped on or eaten which is an option if you so choose.\n\nSo the tiny people worship you and it's funny when you run around the land, tiny people follow.\n\nJust then demons and such, that don't like your conversion, arrive to stop you and so the hack and slash begins. Lots of it. Basic arcade style hack and slash. It's not bad, it's just there is not much to it. Hack and slash your way through the land all the while converting until you defeat KUL who is the cause of the mess.\n\nNow for the issue. Signal Studios did not finsih this game. Technically Ascend: Hand of Kul is still in beta and the devs "kinda" put it on the shelf to work on later. The story goes that the devs moved on to another game and supposably will return to finish up what they left. I could be wrong, but I'm not holding my breath for their return. There are some glitches and hickups here and there. Typical beta problems. Also there is a bug that makes it difficult to save the game.\n\nSo why am I playing this game and recommending it?\n\nI'm an easy going gamer and able to over look glitch and bug issues. Although I do have my limits. One game comes to mind that I stopped playing due to gaming issues and that is X-Rebirth.  Ascend: Hand of Kul is no where near as bad. Also, the problem with saving the game has been solved with a little trick. Always exit the game by pressing Alt F4. What ever reason this corrects the saving problem.\n\nSO! If you can over look minor glitchy, buggy issues and pay no mind that the game may never make it out of beta..... Or maybe it will..... Then at least check out Ascend: Hand of Kul cause it is a fun game. Heck, it's FREE with option to buy stuff and there are other players still running around ingame.\n\nNOW GO FORTH AND CONVERT THE LAND!\n\nOh it get really ugly\n\nREVIEW UPDATE REVIEW UPDATE\n\nI first found out the latest about Ascend Hand of Kul at this Steam post.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/102500/discussions/0/412448792369815215/\n\nI dug around wiki and found this.....\n\n38 Studios Bankruptcy\nThe state of Rhode Island became concerned over 38 Studios' finances after the company defaulted on a $1.125 million loan payment. The studio had sent a check that bounced due to insufficient funds. Keith Stokes, executive director of Rhode Island's EDC, later announced his resignation. The second payment attempt by the studio on May 18, seventeen days past the initial due date and in the form of a $1,025,000 wire transfer and a $100,000 personal check from an unnamed source, was successful. However, 38 Studios consequently was unable to make payroll that week. WPRI reported that both CEO Jennifer MacLean and Senior Vice President of Product Development John Blakely had indicated that they had left the company; MacLean dated her departure to March 2012, when she took a leave of absence.\n\nOn May 24, 2012, 38 Studios officially declared bankruptcy, ceasing operations and laying off both its entire staff and that of Big Huge Games via a mass email. The Rhode Island state police, the attorney general's office, the U.S. Attorney's office, and the FBI began launching investigations into the company. Schilling publicly addressed the studio's failure on Boston radio station WEEI, revealing that he never took a salary and ended up losing his entire personal fortune of $50 million. "I'm tapped out. ... I put everything in my name in this company. But I'm not asking for sympathy. That was my choice."\n\nThe state of Rhode Island filed a lawsuit in November 2012 against Schilling, Stokes, and other backers of 38 Studios. The state's economic development agency settled for $4.4 million on June 27, 2014. On May 19, 2014, WPRI reported that some studio executives from 38 Studios knew that the money they accepted from the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation was not enough to finish development on Project Copernicus.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission became involved in the matter in March 2016 charging both the Rhode Island Economic Development Corp. as well as Wells Fargo with fraud. Specifically noting that the two companies were aware that the $50 million loan was not enough for 38 Studios to finish work on Project Copernicus but failed to notify bond investors of the risk.\n\n\nAlso, the latest I can see about the game itself is that is slowly falling apart. A very sad situation in what could have been a fantastic game.\n\nThis is my first review to switch from yes, to a no I DO NOT RECOMMEND ASCEND HAND OF KUL.\nOh Well.......... ON TO THE NEXT GAME!!!! :D","June 2, 2015","false","71.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

Your Caos moves slow, there's no dodge option, and there's no running, save for a small dash. The combat system seems a decade behind its time, and the gear you acquire through chests does not compare to gear you can buy through micro-transactions. Sure you can grind your way up to buy the gear, but it will take more time than what it's worth, and time is money. This is definitely a pay to win game, although I didn't fight any ascended with insane gear, but if you look at the champions sitting at the sanctuary, you'll know how they acquired the gear. I don't reccomend this game because it is not something I enjoyed, but try it out since it's free, and maybe you might have a different opinion.","May 24, 2014","false","2.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There is TL;DR section at bottom.\n\nWe'll begin with:\n\n[GRAPHICS]\nThe game boasts of decent graphics as evident by the various screenshots, it runs smoothly for the most part with some occasional flutters. But since this is in beta, it's kinda acceptable.\n3.5/5\n\n[STORY]\nThe game has a decent story line. The world is up for grabs and 3 Gods are vying for a chance to reign supreme over them. You are their envoy called as Caos. Each god has distinct features, powers, and blessings bestowed upon its followers. As a Caos you induce your God's faith in people by showing them might. Although I haven't played much, the story is quite rich. However, it's just not gripping enough to actually suck you in.\n3/5\n\n[GAMEPLAY]\nGameplay is very simple, the ye olde Hack n Slash game with some spells added in and one twist. The twist is that each player plays in a parallel universe and they can interact with other players by means of Curses or Blessings, Curses go for enemy players and Blessings for allies(same God followers). It's addictive gameplay, however its somewhat evident that the game was meant to be played with a console gamepad. Occasionally the controls are unresponsive.\n4/5\n\n[ECONOMY]\nI am an avid F2P game lover, and before jumping into any F2P game, I check its economy rating. The economy in Ascend is rather simple. Everything can be bought with "Souls", all weapons, armors, runes, boosts, spells and cosmetics are bought with souls. Additionally, something worth mentioning is that, the weapons and armors have something called durability, and it costs souls to repair them. Everything in the game is costly, however you do not feel compelled to buy souls with money. If you play decently and sensibly you can earn more than you spend, however this requires proper analysis of in-game situations. As the game progresses, the risk-reward increases.\n3/5\n\n[OVERALL| TL;DR]\nAs the game comes free, I see no harm in you trying it, its atleast a few hours of Hack and Slash fun. The progression system isn't that nice, yet. You don't feel as rewarded to level up as you should, however leveling up hardly has any effect on the game whatsoever. Think of this a multiplayer(somewhat) God of War, but with a less decent storyline and gameplay.\n\n3/5\n\nPlay it.","June 27, 2014","true","11.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"

Ascend: Hand of Kul convinces with an immediate gameplay and some very interesting features, even if not always implemented properly. Bloody and based on a fun battle system, Ascend: Hand of Kul is a free-to-play videogame which implements some interesting ideas without managing to exploit them to their full potential.

The Combat is smooth most of the time, except when you fight too many ranged enemies. The problem here is that the combat gets repetetive very quickly, as you fight the same enemies over and over again with little to no variety until mid to late game. Each type of weapon has its own moves which makes it slightly more fun , but in the end, only few weapons are actually worth to play with. I have seen so many negative reviews based on the fact that you cannot afford to buy anything because you have to repair your gear all the time and i wanted to clarify this. The combat in this game has a combo counter where each 10 successful hits in row without being hit yourself ( you can block enemy hits, it wont stop the combo. ) give you + 100 % more souls for the kill, therefore if you kill Ogre with a 70 hit combo, you get 600 % amount of souls ( Ogre gives 1000 souls when killed with no combo. ) which is 6000, this amount can repair most of your gear if its not absolutely destroyed, i should also mention that enemies like the Ogres and other boss-like enemies are behind every corner, that is why you can get as much souls as you want, you just need to fight well. I want to mention Boosts as well, they usually give you 30 minute Boost of some kind, i was using the Gear protection Boost most of the time because you cannot damage your weapon or armor while it is active, therefore you dont need to repair it, there are many kinds of boosts, attack speed or cooldown reduction for example. As i mentioned early on, the game gets repetetive and boring very quickly, you have to clear the same dungeons again and again to open never ending amounts of doors so you can continue the story line just to open more doors. I have also suffered from disconnections from the server each 20-45 minutes, which results in the game crashing most of the time, and occasional freezes during loading . PvP in this game makes you fight against enemy bots, to defend your own shrines, which is , at least for me it was, very easy, they are bots after all, and i never even died in this game.If you get damaged, you can just dash away, regenerate, and try again, so there is not much difficulty here. Overall its not a bad game, its free to play and beta after all, but it simply does not do anything special . 7/10","June 10, 2014","true","21.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Microtransactions are rather useless. It's NOT p2w! Just rush to endgame (around level 20-25) and then run the infinite dungeon for enormous amounts of souls. The shop looks like a huge joke. The shop also has no items that you couldn't get anyway the normal way by spending like 20 minutes extra which saves you ~5$.\nThis is the only reason why I upvoted the game.

I wish there was an auto-repair feature.\n- The minimap is small and the big map is annoying to navigate to using a controller.\n- After about 30 minutes in the game all the way to endgame every fight feels the same and it becomes extremely repitive.

You can't dual wield 2 huge axes or hammers like in Dark Souls.\n- Bosses that instantly turn around 180 degrees and hit you. Like the bear-mini-boss that falls down and at the very last moment just before he hits the floor he turns around 180 degrees and hits you even though you where standing BEHIND it.\n- Hitboxes that are off. The Ogre's for example attack forward and hit you even though you are standing safely behind them without even touching them during any animation. Not to mention that these guys sometimes also instantly turn around.\n- The server lags a bit when you use a super fast build. Corpses may spawn in the wrong location and such.\n\n\n\n=========== The Rest ===========\n- Extremely unbalanced. This can be either good or bad depending on what kind of player you are.\nYou can become so fast that no mob can hit you, you can pretty much perma stun bosses at low level and heal during most fights by just walking back a little so that the boss loses agro. Or just walk out of agro range so that any boss adds no longer agro you.\nAlso invaders can be stunlocked and killed without taking damage at all.\n- The game is extremely easy and you will steamroll all the way through it.

Or just walk out of agro range so that any boss adds no longer agro you.\nAlso invaders can be stunlocked and killed without taking damage at all.\n- The game is extremely easy and you will steamroll all the way through it. Might be interesting for casual players. But for die-hard players this is just not worth playing anymore after like 1 hour into the game.","May 22, 2014","true","19.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game is great, and when originally released on the Xbox 360, I played this game like mad.\n\nThe main premise is that you a Caos, a giant divine being, that is working for one of the New Gods to reclaim the land from the Titan, a Old God that now just a husk of evil due to being corrupted by the world of man. There are 3 New Gods for you to choose from: Dark, Void, and Light. Dark Uses the power of fire, and improves you melee combat by increasing damage and armor. Void uses ice, and makes your magic stonger and giving you evasion. Light uses lightning, and increases movement speed and crit chance.\n\nThe combat in this game reminds me of the first Fable actually. It uses the simple weak attack/strong attack that many games use. You can also throw spells into the mix. When a emeny is low enough on health you can execute them, which has multiple animations depending on what weapon you are using or the enemy you are fighting, which gives you bonus XP. The enemies also level with you, so you cant really just faceroll through the game. You can also go through dungeons, which give loot at the end and are a randomly generated layout. There is even a endless dungeon you can go into.\n\nThe multiplayer in this is interesting, having two different types of interactions. These interations can be influenced by the players themselves, or by AI. The player to player interactions are somewhat minor, but you can mess with/help people. To mess with people, you can send enemies from your world into another players world, or summon your own enemies straight into their world. As the enemies do damage, or even kill the other player, you get rewards. You can help other players by dropping buff fountains into their world, which gives them the specified buff for a good bit of time.\n\nAs you play through the game you build shrines for the god you follow or capture alters for them. As time passes, these will get attacked by other "players" trying to convert it to their god. This also happens while you are not playing, so land will be captured even when you are not playing. When you defend your shrine/alter, or attack theirs, another players Caos will drop in to defend/attack. Now these Caos are AI controlled, but they are outfitted in the gear and spells they had equipped when the other player Ascended (which I will explain later). While yes these are controlled by the AI, they can still be quite difficult to fight, since they may have better gear and spells. The AI also somewhat adapts to how you play, by blocking more if you are hyper aggressive, or by breaking your guard if you are overly defensive.\n\nThe unique thing about this game is that your character will Ascend, which you can do every 5 levels. Ascending does multiple things, with the most straight forward one being raising your level cap to the max level of 60. (The initial level cap is 20) When you ascend, you sacrifice yourself, and create your character anew. This allows you to customize their appearence again, as well as pledge allegiance a different New God if you want. You keep your old gear, but have the option of buying different gear when creating your character again. Once you are done making your new character, you will be exactly where you were as the previous character, so story (and thus unlocked areas) progession isnt lost. Now you will have a Ascended Champion, which invade other players worlds in the gear and level they were at the moment of ascention. (Which I described above) They will fight for they god they were devoted to at the time of ascention as well. As they do this, they will earn you souls as well. So as you play through the game, you will be making a army of former characters.\n\n\nThe real money aspect of the game (that pretty much every F2P game has) is that you can spend real money to buy souls. You use souls to buy/repair gear and to buy spells, boosts, runes, etc as well. This isnt much of a big deal, since you will be making souls by simply playing the game, earning more as you level. Because of this, the real money aspect isnt much of a problem, so it doesnt really ruin the game.\n\nI highly recommend this game.","August 9, 2014","true","4.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It had a few issues, but none of the issues you'd expect out of a new launch.  The servers were fine, there was very little lag, and I didn't have to wait for a year to log in.  It didn't send me out of game to create an account for their website, like so many games do, either.  All of these things were a very nice surprise.\n\nThe game itself is a hack and slash not unlike things like Dark Souls.  In fact, Souls are actually the currency in this game.  It sticks to the next-gen'ish gameplay that we've been seeing lately :  Single Player with a mix of leaderboards and "invade style" multiplayer PvP.\n\nThe combat is fun, as is the customization options.  You can make a pretty cool looking character, and there are tons of armor / weapon options - each weapon giving you a new combo-moveset to use.\n\nThe devs seem to be taking user suggestions into account.  When it first launched, a lot of people were complaining it was pay to win, because honestly, the store prices were way too high.  They fixed this quickly, though, and I think I've seen updates downloading every day I've launched Steam since getting it.\n\nIt's a game you can play for a few hours, or just for a few minutes, and still have a blast.  There is almost 0 grinding involved.\n\nAnd hey, it's free, so why not give it a shot?","May 28, 2014","true","4.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

When a emeny is low enough on health you can execute them, which has multiple animations depending on what weapon you are using or the enemy you are fighting, which gives you bonus XP. The enemies also level with you, so you cant really just faceroll through the game. You can also go through dungeons, which give loot at the end and are a randomly generated layout. There is even a endless dungeon you can go into.\n\nThe multiplayer in this is interesting, having two different types of interactions. These interations can be influenced by the players themselves, or by AI. The player to player interactions are somewhat minor, but you can mess with/help people. To mess with people, you can send enemies from your world into another players world, or summon your own enemies straight into their world. As the enemies do damage, or even kill the other player, you get rewards. You can help other players by dropping buff fountains into their world, which gives them the specified buff for a good bit of time.\n\nAs you play through the game you build shrines for the god you follow or capture alters for them. As time passes, these will get attacked by other "players" trying to convert it to their god. This also happens while you are not playing, so land will be captured even when you are not playing. When you defend your shrine/alter, or attack theirs, another players Caos will drop in to defend/attack. Now these Caos are AI controlled, but they are outfitted in the gear and spells they had equipped when the other player Ascended (which I will explain later). While yes these are controlled by the AI, they can still be quite difficult to fight, since they may have better gear and spells. The AI also somewhat adapts to how you play, by blocking more if you are hyper aggressive, or by breaking your guard if you are overly defensive.\n\nThe unique thing about this game is that your character will Ascend, which you can do every 5 levels. Ascending does multiple things, with the most straight forward one being raising your level cap to the max level of 60. (The initial level cap is 20) When you ascend, you sacrifice yourself, and create your character anew. This allows you to customize their appearence again, as well as pledge allegiance a different New God if you want. You keep your old gear, but have the option of buying different gear when creating your character again. Once you are done making your new character, you will be exactly where you were as the previous character, so story (and thus unlocked areas) progession isnt lost. Now you will have a Ascended Champion, which invade other players worlds in the gear and level they were at the moment of ascention. (Which I described above) They will fight for they god they were devoted to at the time of ascention as well. As they do this, they will earn you souls as well. So as you play through the game, you will be making a army of former characters.\n\n\nThe real money aspect of the game (that pretty much every F2P game has) is that you can spend real money to buy souls. You use souls to buy/repair gear and to buy spells, boosts, runes, etc as well. This isnt much of a big deal, since you will be making souls by simply playing the game, earning more as you level. Because of this, the real money aspect isnt much of a problem, so it doesnt really ruin the game.\n\nI highly recommend this game.","August 9, 2014","true","4.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

From there you able to buy different type of hairs,face,facial hairs,skin colours,armor & weapon.\n\nYou are given three option to choose which path you want to go ( Darkness,Light & Void ). Each of them have their own unique benefit and able to grant you new spells that the other path doesn't offer.\n\nThe game tutorial is very well done.\n\nYou have different types of weapon which some of them have longer range & other short range but deal extremely high damage.\n\nThe combo system is kinda basic i would say since there is only few different type of combo you could perform.\n\nAs you go further into the game,you able to invade many realms & areas. Some of them give you benifit to call your little army. This tiny people will aid in your combat though it pretty useless at the sametimes cause it deal little to no damage to the enemy. The only best things is to eat them to regenerate your health when you are low on health.\n\nThe game has durability system which done very poorly.  Your armor & weapon will break more often and repairing is very costly when you need the souls to buy stronger equipment. But do not worry though,the game have chest that scattared around the places so you don't have to worry wasting your souls just to repair your equipment.\n\nThe game is pretty linear but it had some little exploration.\n\nYou can also perform finishing moves as well on your foes and this will grant you additional health & experience points.\n\nGRAPHICS : 7/10\n\nThe game look pretty decent for a low budget title.\n\nCharacter models,terrain,texture details and environment is very well done. Though some of the area & world can get pretty dull and some of them have repetitive environment.\n\nAUDIO : 7/10\n\nThe soundtrack for this game fit very well with the settings.\n\nVoice acting is not bad.\n\nThe sound effects is decent.\n\nLONG-LASTING APPEAL : 5/10\n\nCan't say that this game offer much replaybility.\n\nOnce you completed the game,you can try out different paths to test out different spells.\n\nThe game is pretty straightforward with no additional side quest to do.\n\nThere is a PvP mode too but this will happen random times when other player trying to invade your realms. You can try to grind for levels but it doesn't serve much purpose.\n\nThe game also have survival modes you unlock as you progress through the game.\n\nPvE would be a nice touch but it seems that this game doesn't provide any at all.\n\nFINAL VERDICT : 6.8/10\n\nI say give it a try for those who like hack & slash game.\n\nThe combat system can get stale after sometimes but it pretty enjoyable nonetheless.\n\nThe game is violent at times but it not God Of War level of violence.\n\nDeveloper will include new areas in the upcoming updates.\n\nGRADE : D ( Not Bad )","May 21, 2014","true","1.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

In some respects it actually perfectly fits the Pay 2 Win bill. And I don't throw that around lightly.\n\nBasically, you are some kind of pseudo-giant whom's single purpose is to follow a lineair path set by the story, while claiming shrines along the way for the God you have chosen. This is accompanied by a simple gear & loot system. Chests are scattered across the several maps you have to plow through which often contain mediocre to outright crappy gear for you to wear and use. This enforces the idea that the best gear is bought with Souls.\n\nSouls is the central currency. You earn it by completing tasks set before you, dealing with mobs and some such.\nBut you can also simply buy it for real life cash.\nThat's right. Not only can you buy the best gear available to you at any point in the game (the game even pauses) but you can skip the grind entirely for it.\n\nAnd this fact has become very obvious in my first few hours of gameplay. You see, the shrines you conquer for the Questline can actually be contested by other players. When this happens, an NPC of their character comes and fights you for it. Losing equals to losing the shrine, which means you lose some vaguely described buffs.\nNow, for a level 6, that NPC looked strangely well equipped. Compared to my honestly grinded character, at least.\n\nBUT it doesn't end there. Nooooo. You see, players who are treading the same path as you are shown as 'phantoms' that are color coded according to their chosen God. One feature is where you can buy Curses and Miracles, or whatever the buff things are called. The name doesn't matter because Curses are what it's all at.\n\nBuy a curse for souls, at any point you please, target another Caos (that's the race you play as, not a typo) and presto, you can spam them with countless of high powered mobs (the curses have limited usage per purchase). Do that in an area where you know shrines are going to be contested, and you've got some rageworthy situations where it became nigh impossible for me to even move on with the quest because the NPC and mobs kept killing me. Let alone win my Shrine back. And death refills everyone's health, but fleeing refills the NPC's as well.\n\nWhat Ascend has here is a very elaborate system that encourages both Pay 2 Win as well as persistent trolling.\nIf you want a game where your money can make people miserable, Ascend is the way to go.\nStraight up, go do it. Do your best to make people miserable in this game. The more you do it, the bigger the chance this atrocity of a game will collapse onto itself. Do it for your next of kin, as if that would ever be a reality.\n\nAs said, the base concept of this game has potential. But it fails brutally in it's execution. The fact that it even rewards P2W by listing the top players as the 'Champions' of their respective Gods is nothing short of a slap in the face. Because you know these are the players who have really cheesed it out and gamed the system to it's maximum.\n\nUnless all of these aspects speak to you and you've got some weird masochism thing going on, I really don't recommend playing this game. Free To Play has long stopped being a valid excuse to give a game a pass.\nThese games commonly have cash shops which should make them subject to the same standards as full-priced games do.\n\nAnd the word Beta stops having any meaning when the game starts charging you money for anything.","June 12, 2014","false","2.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The combat's fine, if a bit easy against regular AI enemies. Spamming left mouse and dash attack makes it almost impossible for them to hit you, while racking up your combo counter.\n\nThe combat in the PVP doesn't seem like it's working as intended. It seems that blocking is incredibly good right now, because using Strong Attacks to break the guard doesn't seem to ever hit, or very rarely hit. Over a few pvp fights, only one strong attack actually connected. The others flew right through the other player. I don't mean it missed, I mean it literally swung through the player, and didn't hit them at all.\n\nOn the positive side though, the cash shop is fine. You can pay to get good equipment from the start, but you get plenty of souls, the currency, just playing the game. Your combo counter goes up, the more times you hit enemies without being hit, which in turn multiplies the amount of souls you get for killing enemies.\n\nThe game's in beta, as it says in big fat letters on the title screen, so this is all based on the build of the game that was first made available on Steam.","May 20, 2014","false","1.2"," 20 of 39 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","20","39","0","0"

And resently i have gotten pretty far for a (noob) person who's played this much of it. But I have been noticeing once you hit a certain level the sould become harder to get, Thats becasue at the higher level its more expensive to repair I get it. But the prices can be redicules sometimes. <<<SIDENOTE>>> THOSE WHO SAY THAT THIS GAME IS PAY TO WIN ARE DUMB ASSES!! The sould you get are around 10-20 per mob on a normal kill. But here are the reasons its not a pay-2-win\n\n1) souls are the only thing you can buy\n2) souls are free you infact dont need to buy them at all (like me)\n3) the more you hit the monsters the more you get (combos..... 10,15,20,etc,,,,, hits = 10(or how ever many) x2,x3,x4,etc....\n4) mobs are NEVER ALONE! (can fight in pack from 2 - 20)\n\nOk, so enough of that.... this is the part where I dis the game\n\n\n\n1) Buggy (I know its a beta but still feels like I should be in alpha) getting stuck in walls, or like me UNDERGOUND.\n2) Stupidly high prices on crappy stuff(but you can find a epic deal here and there)\n3) Having the "honor" to face people that are level 30+ (with their gear and add +'ed so high)\n4) combat is still a little clunky\n\nSo that is my reveiw on the game (the graphic are ok but i can care less of how good they are comapred to other game).      (I dont judge the game by graphic like kids now a days. i judge it on the content). If you would like me to explain more on how the gameplay is or if your stuck at a certain boss please dont be afraid to Add me. Other than that this game is great and i will rate it at..... 8.5/10","May 26, 2014","true","63.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

(They're also really into the idea that when they knock you on the floor they're allowed to keep swinging to wipe out a full health bar.) Blocking these attacks puts you into a stun animation (as well as a bit of chip damage) and knocks you back. These two components mean you have to then rush forward to get damage off, but these enemies have perhaps half a second of rest before they attack instantly again. (Fun fact: You can sit on the edge of their aggro range and wait for the auto healing to fill up your health bar as they do nothing till you're back in range of their aggro.)\n\nTherefore, you rely on magic! Which does no damage.\n\nPerhaps if you stick forward for 900 hours of this shallow M1/M2 mashing you might get to the point where spells are an effective combat technique, but for early game these larger battles serve more as a way of brutally pounding your ♥♥♥♥ with little way of enjoyably taking on enemies.\n\nIn short.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zirune/recommended/233630/","zirune","zirune","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zirune/","991 products in account","Note: This review is based on the game as it stands at the time of review. The game is listed as a Beta, and I fully understand expect that many things in this review will be improved upon as the game is worked on. This review is regarding whether you should play it *as of the time of the review*, and has no bearing on the future. I may revisit the game at a later time to update the review.\n\nThe first thing you probably want to know: Is this free-to-play game pay-to-win? Can people buy their way to being stronger than everybody else? Well, while there is nothing that cannot be earned through playing, you can acquire almost anything you want by paying for it. XP boosts, stat boosts, better equipment, better spells, all of it can be acquired by paying. Of course, there are some things you'll need to actually play for; there are some stat increases you can only get through ascending (a sort of new game+-lite feature), you cannot straight-up buy levels, and equipment available to buy (or find) is tied to your level. While there is currently no PvP (only PvAI where the AI controls another player's character), there will be in the future. I haven't played this game on console, so I don't know exactly how it will be, but from what I see, the upcoming PvP will be very much pay-to-win. Even the invasions, where AI-controller players take control of your territory and you must defeat them to regain it, can be incredibly difficult against opponents that have paid. The fortunate thing is that these invading characters don't level up, so you can level up yourself or acquire better gear in order to defeat them.\n\nNow, the gameplay. Think of it as a stripped down version of Darksiders, which is like a stripped down version of Devil May Cry. You have light attacks you'll spend all day spamming and heavy attacks you'll only use to break guards, as that's all they're really useful for. You have spells you can use freely, with only their cooldowns and charges limiting them; some of them are unwieldy to use and very weak, and in general the spells are fairly unspectacular. You can also block, which reduces (but doesn't completely eliminate) the damage you take from non-heavy attacks and spells. Ultimately, it largely boils down to button-mashing with the occasional block, dash-attack to escape, and spell to keep enemies at bay.\n\nThe dungeons are very much all the same. There are a few different layouts that are recycled over and over with different skins on them. All of the enemies, chest locations, and bosses are generally the same, as well. It's Dragon Age 2-level of environment recycling.\n\nEnemies are both incredibly boring and frustrating. You'll see the same half-dozen enemies over and over again, with hours between seeing anything new. The weak enemies are complete pushovers, while the stronger ones are almost unreasonably powerful in comparison. As far as bosses, the hit detection on their attacks is awful, such that their attack will hit you without their weapon coming into contact with you, even if you interrupt the attack with a spell, so long as their attack begins. There's very little variety in bosses as well; you'll end up seeing the same bosses over and over and over again, with no differences except being a higher level. Even the "big" bosses, the Apexes, are almost completely identical to one another.\n\nThen there's the sound. Your weapons, all of them, sound like hollow metal tubes hitting wood, regardless of what you're hitting. The music is at least alright, though.\n\nThere is a 3-sided war that overarches the game, with players choosing one of three gods to follow, aid, and gain power from. You're told when you initially make the choice that it is permanent, however you can choose whichever one you want each time you ascend. In fact, you're losing out if you don't choose each god at least once, as that's the only way to gain access to that god's spells. It makes the war between the gods completely pointless if people can choose whatever side they want almost without restriction at any time.\n\nIt's also worth keeping in mind that this game requires you to be online. Losing your connection will cause you to disconnect from the game, wiping out the progress since the last save. Luckily, the game autosaves fairly frequently.\n\nThis game still needs a lot of work to be in a state that I would deem worth playing. If you're interested in playing it, look at the date of this review and check what's been done with it since.","May 21, 2014","false","9.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

When I got the game I was disappointed. Let's see why:\n\nGraphics: 3.5/10\nI didn't really see a discernable difference between Antialiasing on and off. It looks like a game from 2006, as the graphics remind of TES IV: Oblivion. There was nothing noteworthy at all. At the start of the game you create your character through various preset heads, hair, face, etc. But looking at most of the textures it looks blurry on my laptop. Now this maybe my laptop you say but it's not. My laptop could max out CRYSIS 1-2 with CRYSIS 3 at HIGH. The world doesn't look taht good either but it looks better than the rest.\n\nGameplay: 5.5/10\nGraphically it may suck, but gameplay wise it feels like GoW, which is good combos aren't bad. But I expected more out of it. My main problem is when it came to the controls. It feels like a console game. Because its a port of a console game. That's basically why I deleted it. It didn't feel like a PC Game. It felt like an Xbox Live title. (Not that there's anything wrong with XBL titles) But playing games like on this on my laptop is frustrating since i can't plug my WIRELESS xbox controller to my laptop. Arguably you could just rebind the controls but I don't know, it just didn't help for me. Also from the chracter creation, It was already obvious, this is P2W (Pay to Win) kind of games. But its not that "insulting" compared to other F2P games out there. And since I refuse to GRIND and waste my time getting better items, since it is obvious that the key to winning is BETTER items.\n\nI know this game is still in beta but I really couldn't get into the game that much. I know a lot of you will enjoy this type of game, (especially since its free) but for now unless it gets out of beta skip the game, for now.","May 21, 2014","false","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Because Pay to Win rears it's ugly head. Please don't stop reading after the Pay to win statement I know it get's thrown around a lot and in some cases unjustly please just read on.\nI really enjoy this game. I have have done well so far but here is the problem. I started at launch on Steam. So I have been playing for a good bit in two days I think however I just recently ran into a guy who's avatar has been wrecking me. Why? Because he purchased a ♥♥♥♥ ton of souls and is unstoppable. The main currency in this game is souls. Infact there is no other currency. Use souls to buy spells use them to buy gear! Congrats you win! If you grind for a while you will not be getting an obscene amount of souls I have spent around 200k souls and only have about 5k on my character at this time. To give you an idea I spend about 8k to fix a broken weapon or armor. However with just a small purchase of $75 you get 750k WOOO that means you can ascend choose a god buy all the spells you want from it then once you get the strongest spells that you had to do nothing for you except progress the story which will be ♥♥♥♥ing easy because you just buy the best gear you can ascend again! Then choose another god and buy all the spells you want again! YES I have officially bought my way into power. Now I can go back to the god of my choosing and keep all the spells I just purchased and then buy all the best gear from the market place cause hey it's cheap when you just blew 75 bucks on 750k souls! So the main issue you if you introduce pvp all the poor kids or people who are responsible with money and can't just through into a fire will be ♥♥♥♥ out of luck. I like this game it is fun but this kind of market will destroy a communite and turn people away from your game. I know the agruement will come up oh you know you can just play through and farm end game while that is true. If you are getting your ♥♥♥ stomped at every turn losing the land you fought hard to get against someone who just bought whatever they wanted why play? Why should player be interested in playing a game that he could never do well at because someone in a higher income bracket just buy the best ♥♥♥♥ in the game and just beat you. Don't like ♥♥♥♥ing get over it is a usual response but that is no arguement. So don't bother with the same old internet trolling.\nAgain I like this game but they should re work the market to make it fair.

It does the job and runs very smoothly. Blood and gore along with some good sound design work well. I love hearing your half god breath, he sounds massive.\n\nMechanics - This is where the game shines. You play a 'half-god' for one of 3 other gods. From what I can tell you are fighting in real time, other players for territory for your god. Light, dark and void. When another player 'invades' you shrine you have the option to take them on one on one. Its very fulfilling to pull off one of the many finishing moves against a human opponent. Not only that but there are these MASSIVE Titans running around. So far I havnt killed one yet but I am slowly taking over his territory.\n\nNow, as far as I can tell the goal is to 'ascend' up to your god when you are ready. Your avatar will join the gods said army in the battle over territory. Now, I have only ascended twice and each time you are asked if you would like a different god to worship. I've stuck with the 'god of light' for he grants you speed.\n\nIm only 3 hours into this and it took everything in me to put it down.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkRavenFilms/recommended/233630/","DarkRavenFilms","Anthrax Prime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkRavenFilms/","81 products in account","So originally, this game was on the Xbox Arcade, where I first played it many months ago during a free gold weekend.\n\nThis game is an online game, and therefore can only be played if you have internet connection for those of you wondering.\n\nSo this game is very good. I was very far into the "campaign" on my Xbox 360. It is a game you can get far into pretty easily. Combat is amazing though they lack a "lock on feature" which would come in handy very much in future updates. I apologize as I have been playing this with a controller, but the controls for attacking are the standard "X" for regular attacks and "Y" for heavy attacks with of course, having the ability to combine regular and heavy attacks.\n\nThe world itself lacks color and you get a sense of despair and death from the lack of color. While the developers have left plenty of lore for you to look at, I have yet to read them to find out why the world is the way it is. Enemies are designed to look ugly and help add onto this dying world. Hell, I would even go as far as to say even your Caos (The "giants" you play as" look ugly too. But you can tell thought went into the overall design of the game.\n\nSo it needs to also be stated: I was far into the game on my Xbox, but I haven't "beaten" the campaign and I'm not sure if I was even close to beating it. But your main goal is to take down this titan that the humans worship. You are just trying to get powerful enough to take on this titan. Along the way, you have to claim shrines for your God (Darkness, Light, or Void) and have the humans side with you. But here is the catch! Other Caos...The Ascended Caos (They are Caos that were once controlled by other players, but they are bots once they become "Ascended" every five levels) try to claim the shrines for their own gods. (Example would be that if you worship the Darkness, than you will be fighting a Caos who worships the Light or the Void). Failing to beat these Caos or not showing up within the five minutes they come to one of your shrines means that they will take it for their own gods.\n\nThe game is good and it is well thought out. Aside from the usual difference between graphics and framerate, there isn't much difference from the PC version and the Xbox version. The controls were exactly the same for my Xbox controller on the PC version as it was when I played my 360.\nHowever, and I know this game is in BETA at the moment.. but it is CONSTANTLY crashing on me. Game crashed once when I was in the middle of a battle when another player cursed me and once when I just finished a battle. Both crashes happened ten minutes apart but it has been annoying and I am sure there will be more crashes to come. Aside from that, this is a well made game and I recommend. Especially because it is free to play.","May 20, 2014","true","12.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Here is a list of why the game got boring and why I stopped playing it.\n\n- The PVP was too easy\n\n- The PVE was repetitive\n\n- Your character becomes OP after about 24 hours of gameplay and leveling up\n\n- The storyline was also pointless so it became a chore to make a new character if you wanted a new one\n\n- And there is no  level capping in PVP\n\nDespite the things that happen over time as you play through the game, I will always love this game and all that it stands for.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zirune/recommended/233630/","zirune","zirune","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zirune/","991 products in account","Note: This review is based on the game as it stands at the time of review. The game is listed as a Beta, and I fully understand expect that many things in this review will be improved upon as the game is worked on. This review is regarding whether you should play it *as of the time of the review*, and has no bearing on the future. I may revisit the game at a later time to update the review.\n\nThe first thing you probably want to know: Is this free-to-play game pay-to-win? Can people buy their way to being stronger than everybody else? Well, while there is nothing that cannot be earned through playing, you can acquire almost anything you want by paying for it. XP boosts, stat boosts, better equipment, better spells, all of it can be acquired by paying. Of course, there are some things you'll need to actually play for; there are some stat increases you can only get through ascending (a sort of new game+-lite feature), you cannot straight-up buy levels, and equipment available to buy (or find) is tied to your level. While there is currently no PvP (only PvAI where the AI controls another player's character), there will be in the future. I haven't played this game on console, so I don't know exactly how it will be, but from what I see, the upcoming PvP will be very much pay-to-win. Even the invasions, where AI-controller players take control of your territory and you must defeat them to regain it, can be incredibly difficult against opponents that have paid. The fortunate thing is that these invading characters don't level up, so you can level up yourself or acquire better gear in order to defeat them.\n\nNow, the gameplay. Think of it as a stripped down version of Darksiders, which is like a stripped down version of Devil May Cry. You have light attacks you'll spend all day spamming and heavy attacks you'll only use to break guards, as that's all they're really useful for. You have spells you can use freely, with only their cooldowns and charges limiting them; some of them are unwieldy to use and very weak, and in general the spells are fairly unspectacular. You can also block, which reduces (but doesn't completely eliminate) the damage you take from non-heavy attacks and spells. Ultimately, it largely boils down to button-mashing with the occasional block, dash-attack to escape, and spell to keep enemies at bay.\n\nThe dungeons are very much all the same. There are a few different layouts that are recycled over and over with different skins on them. All of the enemies, chest locations, and bosses are generally the same, as well. It's Dragon Age 2-level of environment recycling.\n\nEnemies are both incredibly boring and frustrating. You'll see the same half-dozen enemies over and over again, with hours between seeing anything new. The weak enemies are complete pushovers, while the stronger ones are almost unreasonably powerful in comparison. As far as bosses, the hit detection on their attacks is awful, such that their attack will hit you without their weapon coming into contact with you, even if you interrupt the attack with a spell, so long as their attack begins. There's very little variety in bosses as well; you'll end up seeing the same bosses over and over and over again, with no differences except being a higher level. Even the "big" bosses, the Apexes, are almost completely identical to one another.\n\nThen there's the sound. Your weapons, all of them, sound like hollow metal tubes hitting wood, regardless of what you're hitting. The music is at least alright, though.\n\nThere is a 3-sided war that overarches the game, with players choosing one of three gods to follow, aid, and gain power from. You're told when you initially make the choice that it is permanent, however you can choose whichever one you want each time you ascend. In fact, you're losing out if you don't choose each god at least once, as that's the only way to gain access to that god's spells. It makes the war between the gods completely pointless if people can choose whatever side they want almost without restriction at any time.\n\nIt's also worth keeping in mind that this game requires you to be online. Losing your connection will cause you to disconnect from the game, wiping out the progress since the last save. Luckily, the game autosaves fairly frequently.\n\nThis game still needs a lot of work to be in a state that I would deem worth playing. If you're interested in playing it, look at the date of this review and check what's been done with it since.","May 21, 2014","false","9.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

When I got the game I was disappointed. Let's see why:\n\nGraphics: 3.5/10\nI didn't really see a discernable difference between Antialiasing on and off. It looks like a game from 2006, as the graphics remind of TES IV: Oblivion. There was nothing noteworthy at all. At the start of the game you create your character through various preset heads, hair, face, etc. But looking at most of the textures it looks blurry on my laptop. Now this maybe my laptop you say but it's not. My laptop could max out CRYSIS 1-2 with CRYSIS 3 at HIGH. The world doesn't look taht good either but it looks better than the rest.\n\nGameplay: 5.5/10\nGraphically it may suck, but gameplay wise it feels like GoW, which is good combos aren't bad. But I expected more out of it. My main problem is when it came to the controls. It feels like a console game. Because its a port of a console game. That's basically why I deleted it. It didn't feel like a PC Game. It felt like an Xbox Live title. (Not that there's anything wrong with XBL titles) But playing games like on this on my laptop is frustrating since i can't plug my WIRELESS xbox controller to my laptop. Arguably you could just rebind the controls but I don't know, it just didn't help for me. Also from the chracter creation, It was already obvious, this is P2W (Pay to Win) kind of games. But its not that "insulting" compared to other F2P games out there. And since I refuse to GRIND and waste my time getting better items, since it is obvious that the key to winning is BETTER items.\n\nI know this game is still in beta but I really couldn't get into the game that much. I know a lot of you will enjoy this type of game, (especially since its free) but for now unless it gets out of beta skip the game, for now.","May 21, 2014","false","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I probably won't play it again, but I can see this game being a big deal for a lot of people.\n\nOn a final note: The cash shop seems reasonably priced. A few bucks gets you a set of gear (or haircuts or whatever). Granted (as is always the case with cash shop games) some items are just silly expensive, but it doesn't come off as pay to win.\n\nI'd give it a solid 7/10.

It is fast paced, easy to access and play, and has some interesting unique gaming concepts. You are a demigod of sorts initially born from the prayers and pleading of worshippers. When you "awaken" you are given some limited options for character customization and then selection of armor and weapons based upon your play style. Weapon animations differ depending on the weapon type you choose. The attack sequences are familiar to us all who have played action based games in the past. Light attack, Light attack, Heavy Attack....combos with the mouse. Left click, left click, Right click. And different variations. Light, heavy. Light Light Light Heavy, and so forth. You get the picture. You are lead through a very linear path completing objectives while being told a story. All the while you are fighting monsters in a limited destructable environment. As you kill things you collect experience and "souls", which are the currency of the realm used to repair and purchase items and spells, which you use to increase your demi-gods abilities. You are given various challenged throughout while playing.\nOne of the games unique aspects is your ability to effect others games. You don't exactly play alongside anyone. What is going on is you can sort of see a ghostly outline of other players who are in the same area as you are but in sort of a seperate instance. You see them fighting but don't exactly see what they are fighting. Its sort of like you are aware they are there without actually "being" right there with them. You will understand if you play it. But anyways, you see this other player fighting and at the same time maybe you are fighting as well. You have the ability to open a portal to the other players realm and send the monsters you are fighting to him in order to add additional difficulty to his fight. You are rewarded for any damage those monsters do to the enemy player. This is referred to as a "curse". There are options to "bless" or help other players but....I mean who does that? (evil grin)\n\nThe pay model is very forgiving. Its free to play. You can go from beginning to end and not pay anything if you wish. Or you can buy in game currency from their cash store to purchase items. These are the same items you can get normally.\n\nIts a fun game that doesn't get deep into your pocket book. But these guys deserve some monatary support for their work which may not be skyrim great but its better than most of the crap we see published today. Their thinking outside the box in some concepts should be rewarded lest the gaming industry devolve into infinite EA sequals selling us the same game over and over again.

There might be the issue of repairing and upgrading your gear and how costly it and how little you get even if you sold your gear. Though there is also the Option to go back o the Sanctuary to repair your gear.\n\n\nDo not think this game is just another p2w game. But there might be that sometimes you might have lost all your souls(ingame currency) and you cannot repair anything and game might be bit difficult. Actually it once happneded to me I suddenly went from 160k souls to 0 because of some bad choices, but I somehow after trying hard enough I manged to get most of it back. It's easy to get back your souls when you have already the good gear.\n\n\nI'd give this game for the consept 4/5 because i feel it's kinda like attack on titan.\n8/10 for game performance\nVery little lag, even tried with my lowend COMPAQ laptop, damn this game runs smoothly! 9/10\nCharacter creation is a hard hit in the nuts, i'd give it 2/10 for that one\nLooks of gear I'd give 6,5/10\nEpicness 9,5/10\n\n\nThere might come a time like any other game you feel it's starting to get boring.

It takes from games like dark souls with its invasion system, planetside with the 3 factions trying to take over areas of the map, and any number of generic fantasy 3rd person camera button mash-athons.\n\nThe invasion system however has problems take over an area and at random times you get invaded having to defend them and that’s it, as their doesn't seem to be a purposeful invasion system.  You may not even be fighting a personas they can in fact be AI's as if have seen my AI was defeated once I ascended.\n\nThe 3 factions also don’t work when the game is entirely single player.  No; this is not a joke, there is no co-op and the only other thing to indicate multiplayer is the minor invasions which take you out of the area to defend then bring you right back to where you were without the enemies.\n\nAll of these however are not the biggest issue I have with the game which is in fact the pay-to-win feel I get.  Souls are the only source of currency for everything; repairing easily damaged equipment constantly, upgrading your equipment, and upgrading spells.  This wouldn't be a problem if the amount of souls you got from enemies would be able to exceed the amount needed to be able to repair and upgrade to some extent rather than feeling desperate for souls.\n\nSo I spent like $13 dollars got some of the souls and started to feel like I was OP after upgrading.  This all came to a crashing halt as I got the ogre where I got destroyed with no real way of being able to beat him.  The game even would bug out so that he would be immune to taking damage every other time I died.  So if I died once I might as well just die again as his health bar would go away from the screen and nothing would matter.  But that reminder of upgrade if you're having problems kept showing up and so I gave up since a game with this bad of a "paywall" isn't really going to ever be worth it in the end.\n\nI won't even really get into the flat graphics, or illogical world design around the "caos" rather than the humans or titans, or the boring combat with just button mashing as this review is long enough.\n\nSorry for being so long but this is what I experienced in short bad paywalls/ pay to win/ breaking glitch with ogre/ lack of creativity/ poorly uninspired concepts taken from other games that do them better.\n","May 20, 2014","false","2.5"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

Also i didnt have the issue of armor breaking and i have to pay real money for it i didnt not spend a single dime on this game and i finished the story mode within 2 days. Over all this game can be a lot of fun but the amount of bugs are just too much.

Oh well give us money and we'll fix it for you."\n\n"Oh do you need a new weapon? Give us 5 dollars and its yours!"\n\nThe ratio of how many souls you get for doing stuff to how fast your equipment breaks/how expensive it is to repair it is like 1:40. (Maybe a little exaggerated but it basically forces you to spend real money unless you want to sit in the Endless Dungeon for literal hours to get one item repaired...)\n\nNot to mention it's really repetitive. There's like 4 objectives: Kill this, kill that, cleanse this, cleanse that, repel the invader etc. Oh god don't get me started on the combat. There's like a total of maybe 10 different moves and I dunno, 4 types of weapons?\n\nIt'd be a sin to not mention the bosses are complete BS. No I'm not talking hard, I'm talking BS.

Tiny humans can ride on your back shooting enemies. Totally rad. You are a giant monster man killing things and destroying nearly everything. Also rad. There is a global war between the factions and it's persistent which is also really cool. However, the game is total crap. Dont let the fanboy types fool ya.\n\nFirst, the “free to play” model is BS. The cost in souls (in game currency) is out of control. Your gear loses durability faster than anything else ive seen in other games. And fixing it is EXPENSIVE. To make matters worse, even new gear you find in dungeons comes nearly broken and needs to be fixed. Dont want that gear? Sell it, for a whopping 100 souls (cost ya 1k+ to repair it or 5k+ to buy an equivalent from the store lol).\n\nSecond, if you log out you have to start the story over again when you log in. This was the true game breaker for me. I didnt just spend 5 hours working on the story just to start over cause I went to bed. WTF. I get it, you are supposed to ascend your guys (turning them into a NPC and start over new) and thats cool. But I wasnt ascending, I was logging out. That is anti cool and not even a little bit fun.\n\nLastly, the persistent war isnt as cool as one might think. You can be attacked by other players (cool) and instantly teleport and defend your area (also cool) but dont expect to win. All the people who are foolish enough to spend money will CRUSH you. Not to mention the three times I was invaded the invader was 3-5 levels higher than me. Yay.\n\nOn a side but related note, I read that this game is no longer supported by the developers as they have moved onto a new project. That alone should tell you not to spend money. I am a big fan of supporting my “free’ games (have spent thousands of dollars on League of Legends for example) but that is only when I expect consistent developer support and/or game improvements.\n\nSo heed my warning and dont waste time with this game. I really wanted to like it but it is 100% pass.

Downsides is that it becomes a bit repetitive after a while (kill some trolls, do an objective, kill some trolls, fight a boss, kill some trolls) but combat is fluid and fun, so I don't mind. Bossfights remind me of Infinity Blade (If anyone's played that), blocking or dodging depending on the attack and spamming m1/m2 after an attack chain. Bosses are reasnobly challenging and I've heard some of the later ones would not be out of place in Dark Souls. It's free and only a gig or so, just get it and try it.","August 27, 2014","true","13.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Well, yeah, it is!\n\nIf you are looking for an action-title to kill some time and enemies, this might interest you. The combat feels fluid and is simple yet interesting enough. Being made for a console initially, the controls are ported pretty well to the PC, so I never had a problem playing with my keyboard. There are various mechanics to influence the game for other players near you via "gifting" some of your enemies to their realms or blessing them. Those elements really bring some dynamic into the game. The second big thing are your crusaders. At certain levels, you can decide to make an image of your character which will be sent to others games and invade their villages. If successful, this grants you more resources to equip or train your character.\n\nThe whole game is free to play and there is nothing in the game that would allow for pay to win. All you can buy is souls, which are obtainable in the game by playing and in plentiful amounts!\n\n7/10 and a lot of potential left.","September 24, 2014","true","9.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The enemies in this game truly pose a threat to the player as you venture through the land trying to convert the people there to worship your god that you have sworn to serve under. The bosses in this game are a real challenge. Timing is crucial, don't be hasty or your battle will surely result in your defeat. Blocking and dodging are a big part of staying alive in this game, you can't really be a "tank" in this game. If you get hit too much your equipment loses it's durability and requires repairing. Repairing consumes souls, which can result in an insufficient amount of souls.\n\nThe Pros:\n-Challenging\n-Moderate paced gameplay\n-Amazing finisher animations\n-Variety of weapons to use\n-When you kill something, you FEEL LIKE YOU KILL IT\n\nThe Cons:\n-Repetitive\n-Souls can prove hard to obtain\n-Repairing equipment often\n-Not much of a multiplayer system\n-Fustrating battles\n\nThe thrill of crushing the skulls of rabid animals, shattering the bones of skeletons, repeatedly stabbing an orc in the stomach, and stomping mass hordes of humans proved amusing. This game feels like a pretty manly game to me haha. At times I would suffer many deaths from a boss due to my impatience, but when victory comes, it feels so god damn good.\n\n","August 14, 2014","true","9.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfecho/recommended/233630/","wolfecho","WolfEcho","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfecho/","279 products in account","Ascend: Hand of Kul is a great game, it has a lot of potential, and this is going to be a long detailed review as well as a few tips for those who got stuck during the game at key points due to errors and bugs.\n\nGreat points about the game: single currency system which means you can buy souls (if your rich and trigger happy with your credit card) or earn them the hard way, point being you’re not restricted in terms of what gear you can buy like other games with the f2p v "premium" users. Graphics aren't exactly something to rave over but it’s not too shabby either. The 3rd person combat and game cam are great in my opinion, similar to Lionhead's Fable (the first game). Weapons and gear have a few upgrade options and slot enhancements, however I can't help but feel like there’s a lot of other enhancement types missing from the game. Combat is nicely balanced, difficult at the very start but you get used to it as you go on. The ascension system is unique and well implemented, however I would have loved to be able to use one of your ascended champions as a follower in game, or at least be able to summon one for a short duration. As it is your champions are only useful for gaining badges with each ascension and invading other players' world (IA controlled invasion at completely random times), but further useless. There is a large selection of different aesthetic weapon and armor types, which seems to be increasing with each update.\n\nBad points of the game that need improving: Let’s be honest, it was released on xbox first as another microsoft ploy to get people subscribing to the monthly gold membership in order to play online multiplayer games in 2013, but only for americans (typically), as I can’t download it in SA on xbox. The beta released on pc early 2014. It's been in beta state for a while now. A huge let down is that you’re not able to reset your character and start over with a new one, people who ascended too late in game are at a huge disadvantage compared to those who start asap at level 5. There is also no real multiplayer activity going on except for the random IA invasions and seeing other players’ ghosts every now and again, and the occasional creature being player banished into your world. With it being beta state, there are plenty.... plenty of bugs and errors that can be a game breaker and from the forum reviews I've seen, a lot of people just gave up and deleted the game. There is also no real story, no emotion, just a few text pop ups from your chosen deity directing you to kill this and capture that point, which is entertaining if you’re ok with grinding your way through fights and levels, but you get bored after more than a continuous hour or two. Another thing that I think is a huge problem with the game design at the time I’m doing this review, even if it’s a small and silly point to some, is that you do not have the option to play as a female character. That doesn’t change the game since there is no story line but it is something that often discourages some of the female players out there, especially the gender sensitive. Sure the caos aren’t pretty creatures but it’s the thought that counts. The weapon repair system using the forges don’t work offline, but that’s fine they should really be left as they are, it takes a minute or two to repair your armor and weapon in game (if this system was not in the game I wouldn’t have kept playing it past my first ascension, it’s way too expensive to use souls to repair with).\n\nOther suggestions: Something I’m really looking forward to is the player world invasion system (not the AI thing, where you can take your caos and go into another random player’s world and fight them if their online and take over their control points) as well as the other planned worlds as advertised in the sanctum. Hopefully there will be more of a story in those. There is also the option of creating a player combat arena for random head to head fights, where the winner scores a few souls and points in ranking for their deity.\n\nBug and error fixes/bypass: The first major bug I found was after killing the first apex, there’s an animation that keeps getting stuck just before you gain your new spell, the only way to bypass this is to keep trying… if it gets stuck, alt-tab out of the game, close the game and start again, you will start at the same place you were after killing the apex (you won’t have to fight again). Eventually it just works.\n\nThe second major game breaker is at the same spot mentioned above after killing the first apex (and possible other spots in game as well, I got it more than once). What happens is, you get those text pop ups from your deity, some of them get stock and you literally can’t do anything to remove them. You can’t move, you can’t open inventory or menu, you can’t do anything except alt-tab out, close the game and start again. Here’s what to do, you need to time this perfectly, enter the game, before the texts start popping up, hit your left mouse button like crazy. If you time it correctly your caos will strike his weapon between the text pop-ups, for some reason this movement prevents the pop-up that normally gets stuck from freezing. I did this in frustration after the first apex and getting stuck a couple of times, it cleared the stuck pop-up. It may take a few tries, just click before the pop-ups appear.\n\nThe third game breaker is also directly before/after the first apex. You aren’t supposed to enter the next region (2nd apex door) before killing the apex, this causes the vines that close off access to the next area and some chests to form an invisible wall even after you chopped down the vines. If you entered this area you probably also took over the 3 villages… which later causes the text pop-up problem above again later on in the game. You first need to kill the apex in the tomb in the ring of bones, then go to this level and the underseur (a tomb with a name like that, pardon the spelling) and break the heart vine at the lowest level of the tomb. The top vines will die, when you break them the invisible wall will not be there anymore. If you have the same text-pop up bug as above do the following. Since you’ll be stuck in this area when the game starts anyway, exit the game, start it up but in the game menu instead enter your sanctum and don’t select play ascend. This should allow you to warp to other areas, warp to the area that opens after killing the first apex, be sure to kill the apex first before you go here. You should be able to play it now without the pop-ups getting stuck. That’s what I did and it worked fine afterwards.\n\nOverall, when it's properly polished and beyond beta, it should get a surge of new players.\n\n","August 4, 2014","true","55.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Three "factions" to choose from, all of which offer a good and different kind of gameplay. There is only one currency, which you acquire at a pretty fast rate, so pay to win doesn't feel present when playing and certainly not encouraged either. The side specific dungeons are very difficult but 9 times out of 10 end up being worth it (I believe I did five of them, including one of a different side which is unlocked with an in game item, and only ever got one bad haul for loot). Make sure to bring extra weapons with you at all times though, as your weapons take durability damage and you cannot fight with the "back up" dagger and expect to win, as it only does 1-3 damage max.

It feels like Darksiders-inspired combat and art style met the Souls' series doom and gloom and constant hungering for souls, with Warhammer Fantasy as the lore backdrop.\n\nYou are an immortal spirit that serves that new gods that lives in the bodies of giants,  'Caos Warriors.' You choose a deity, and try to take over the world in their name. Your choice of deity gives you your narrator, as well as abilities you can learn throughout the course of the campaign. From there, you charge off into the game.\n\nCombat is action style. Combos are very simple at the moment, but I imagine they could add more in the future. You have quick attacks, the number of which you use resulting in different heavy attacks, a block that works against most abilities, a dodge, and your selection of spells. Every once in a while, when prompted, you can also tap E to do a finisher on an enemy to regain HP. More hits without getting hits gets you more combo points, more combo points get you more souls when you kill stuff.\n\nXP from kills gets you levels. Souls buy you weapons, armour, certain spells (most are earned via plot), spell upgrades, and item upgrades, and are also used to repair, and upgrade current items. Now, you CAN buy souls for real money, but store items are randomized and level locked, so that'll only go so far, though...\n\nEvery few levels, you can shed your body and 'Ascend' it, sending it to Crusade on behalf of one of the New Gods. This is not a handwave to explain a new game plus-esque feature. You lose some levels and your inventory. However, you can use your souls to purchase legacy pillars, and add some of your items to your permanent inventory. You also send your body to one of the gods, and it will actually be able to appear as a random bossfight for other players, capable of earning you and your god rewards. You can also realign to a new god at this point, allowing you to mix and match spells.\n\nDungeons are randomized once a day, and a special item must be purchased with souls to enter dungeons not of your alignment. If you follow Void, you can't enter Blood or Light dungeons without buying a Mask of Blood or Mask of Light. Many spawns and bosses are copy pasted, but these encounters aren't bad, per se, and the addition of other players roaming around can lead to some interesting trouble.\n\nYou can see the 'ghosts' of players in the same zones as you are, coloured by their deity alignment. You can use 'curses' to send them more enemies to fight, or 'blessings' to give them bonuses such as more exp or better spell recharge.

They will tell you that this is a great thing, and that it's free to play, and that even if you're a terrible player you will be able to ascend over & over to become great one day.\n\nNope.\n\nThis is simply another Pay-2-Win.  The currency is souls, which you harvest from killing.  However you also get them from spending cash.  You need souls to repair weapons, to buy character options, to buy weapons, to upgrade spells, to purchase buffs, and to purchase temporary spells that allow you interact with multiplayer.  If you don't do this, you will hit situations where your gear will not be up for the challenge, and you will be repetitively ganked by the game or other players.\n\nBut even if cash weren't an object, it's still nothing to write home about.  Combat is extremely limited, as is mobility.  The controls are clunky.  Ulimately you're wandering around, taking waypoints to gain territory, killing titans, and enslaving humans.

The game itself is minorly confusing to begin with, but I'm used to that with a lot of the F2P games. I can get over that. What tipped me over was when I was fighting a bigger monster and it was about impossible to kill. The action genre of combat they've chosen for this game is very lackluster. The doging isn't particularly good or effective and the frequency in which the bigger monsters attack makes it almost impossible to actually hit. So you get stuck hitting once every few minutes while praying you held block to block the basic attack and hoping he doesn't use a heavy one. All in all, it has potential as a system, but I wouldn't recommend it with the combat as it is. It is also slightly pay-to-win in that the main currency (souls) can be bought with real money and be used to purchase better gear.","June 14, 2014","false","8.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","5"

It feels like Darksiders-inspired combat and art style met the Souls' series doom and gloom and constant hungering for souls, with Warhammer Fantasy as the lore backdrop.\n\nYou are an immortal spirit that serves that new gods that lives in the bodies of giants,  'Caos Warriors.' You choose a deity, and try to take over the world in their name. Your choice of deity gives you your narrator, as well as abilities you can learn throughout the course of the campaign. From there, you charge off into the game.\n\nCombat is action style. Combos are very simple at the moment, but I imagine they could add more in the future. You have quick attacks, the number of which you use resulting in different heavy attacks, a block that works against most abilities, a dodge, and your selection of spells. Every once in a while, when prompted, you can also tap E to do a finisher on an enemy to regain HP. More hits without getting hits gets you more combo points, more combo points get you more souls when you kill stuff.\n\nXP from kills gets you levels. Souls buy you weapons, armour, certain spells (most are earned via plot), spell upgrades, and item upgrades, and are also used to repair, and upgrade current items. Now, you CAN buy souls for real money, but store items are randomized and level locked, so that'll only go so far, though...\n\nEvery few levels, you can shed your body and 'Ascend' it, sending it to Crusade on behalf of one of the New Gods. This is not a handwave to explain a new game plus-esque feature. You lose some levels and your inventory. However, you can use your souls to purchase legacy pillars, and add some of your items to your permanent inventory. You also send your body to one of the gods, and it will actually be able to appear as a random bossfight for other players, capable of earning you and your god rewards. You can also realign to a new god at this point, allowing you to mix and match spells.\n\nDungeons are randomized once a day, and a special item must be purchased with souls to enter dungeons not of your alignment. If you follow Void, you can't enter Blood or Light dungeons without buying a Mask of Blood or Mask of Light. Many spawns and bosses are copy pasted, but these encounters aren't bad, per se, and the addition of other players roaming around can lead to some interesting trouble.\n\nYou can see the 'ghosts' of players in the same zones as you are, coloured by their deity alignment. You can use 'curses' to send them more enemies to fight, or 'blessings' to give them bonuses such as more exp or better spell recharge. More in depth co-op and PvP options are also 'planned.'\n\nIt's derivative of a lot of things, but I think it's an interesting game worth the look, and considering the entry price is 'free' and the download isn't even that big, the only thing you've got to lose from giving it a shot is time. I label it as an okay time killer for now, but this is beta, and I could definitely see it growing into more.","May 25, 2014","true","11.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

No, it's not. If there's something I must say in favor of the game is that I needed not to purchase a soul pack. I played just fine through the game, never saw any "progress walls", maintained all of my territory under control, all by playing the game normally and not even being actively farming for souls. I understand the game suffered changes with time, and before that might have been a valid critique, but not from what I experienced.\n\nThat said, what I didn't like:\n\nDesign.\nWhile graphically the game isn't terrible (not bleeding edge, but a game isn't just about graphics), something that bugs me is how the sense of scale is very rapidly lost. You're supposed to be a giant, but save the tiny humans nothing really makes you feel so, so it's something of the story you forget soon enough. Also on the design part, dungeons. They're kind of "procedurally generated", but since there's only a dozen segments for the game to pick from dungeons end up feeling repetitive very, very quickly.\n\nChanging rules.\nYou're explained the basics of the game, but no intrinsics on the mechanics, which is usually kind of fair for those games going for a "learn by playing" approach, which would be fine except that this game doesn't allow you to load a save game just before you transcended or something of the sort. Or undo the 20 levels you just climbed. You're never quite told that you have there a tiny margin of time to buy spells from all alignments before you pick a God for the first time (bug? long standing given everyone with a very common build of spells on their Crusade Caos), or how if you choose to ascend later rather than early your next ascencion can only be done at a later than usual level.\nA small mess.\n\nBugs.\nGame is just riddled with them and it's why I mostly give the thumbs down, but this is especially because of people starting out. If you somehow feel you're able to cope with some amount of frustration, then the bugs may not matter to you, because with patience you begin to learn them, know how to cope with and even counter them, to the point they barely make a dent to your game play. I suppose I managed to get to that point which is what kept me playing.\nIf you're easily annoyed by broken attack animations, execution animations that don't freeze enemies in place, and other things that invalidate your skills or reflexes, you might want to take a second thought about diving into this one.\n\nThat said, it's not a terrible game, it just needs much love and care from a developer which is currently tending to something entirely different.","May 27, 2015","false","65.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Rather than set you up against a difficult enemy with a special way to kill it they throw a wall of hp that can't be staggered by any attack whose attacks launch you back even when guarded. This applies to both player "phantoms" and bigger monsters, the phantoms by the way, have the ability to use combo finishers whenever they want and block instantly even while recoiling, this extends to them auto-guarding any time you cast a spell.\nI gave this game some time and found it to be fairly lacking, it feels like it could be something better, but the combat system in this game just doesn't work with the enemies they put into it. And since there's nothing in this game but combat, you might see the problem.\n\nI think I should also add that when dealing with player "phantoms", those who used real money to buy better equipment will pretty much always win, I often found myself fighting phantoms at a higher level than myself, using higher level equipment, generally I was able to win, a few close calls here and there, no biggie. The main issue was one dungeon in particular when I had to face a player 2 levels over me using equipment that far outclassed my own, due to the AI of the computer controlled players and the difference in stats it was actually not possible for me to kill him.\n\nIn conclusion: This could have been a good game, but the boss design and phantom AI ruined it for me.","June 3, 2015","false","2.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I'm amazed anyone finds it enjoyable.  I'm amazed anyone can beat these without cheating.  Every attack you take flinches you.  You block and retaliate, use a combo with a heavy attack, which the game says to use against blocks to break them, and the AI ignores it.  They don't flinch.  They just start comboing you.  You take damage before animations even begin.  You react to them using a heavy attack, it's instantly blocked.  In fact, everything is instantly blocked.  You actually GET a combo going, you've suddenly taken damage from nothing, and then you're flinching again, until you block, they ignore your heavy, and you're dead.\n\nThis isn't lag.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dankass/recommended/233630/","dankass","kassquatch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dankass/","170 products in account","Heres my review from www.kassquatch.com/ascend-hand-of-kul-pc-review/\n\nAscend: Hand Of Kul, a free-to-play game, was just released on Steam on May 20th 2014. The game is currently in beta and well, it kind of shows. The concept behind Ascend: Hand of Kul is a solid one. A free-to-play RPG that has seamless integration of single player and multiplayer. While your game is mainly single player, and you have majority of the control in what you do, others have the ability to somewhat change how you do it. You can also impact how others go about their journey also. Which is a novel concept in my opinion. The point of the game is to bring the god of your choosing's influence to the human world and spread it while defeating the other deity's influences all while making your character the "ultimate Caos warrior". There are a total of 3 paths to choose from. The chaotic goddess of darkness, the zealous god of light or the manipulative lord of the void. There are plenty of achievements for those types of people who crave them which is also something nice to have.\n\n\n\nStoryline\n\nWell this paragraph is going to be short because it's a very simple story. The plot is one of you choosing a path of one of 3 deity's. You then go around the human world and convert everything to your deity's influence. That's it. Kill this, beat that, all filler quests that have no real meaning other than spreading your influence. I hope with future updates there is more to the plot.\n\n\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game is definitely made for a console. The controls are clunky, menus are hard to navigate, and key bindings are just weird. More than a few times I got incredibly frustrated at the menus that I quit the game. The only reason I continued to play was to write this review. If that tells you anything about how the rest of this review is going to go. The loading times are horrible. Remember back when PC games loaded everything from CD? Or when Playstation 1 had to load for 1-2 mins between every level because its all stored on the CD? Ya, that's what this game is like. If you take a look at my gameplay video at the bottom of the review, you will see how long it takes to load anything....the game, the levels....anything. And I'm not playing on a old crap computer as you can see here. Also as you can see in the videos, there are parts that totally bog down your FPS. I dropped to 15 FPS sometimes where I can play Arma 3 at 60 fps with 30fps in epic battle mode on ultra settings. I don't know if it's just bad coding or over use of textures, but it's bad.\n\nThe tutorial you play takes forever. Coupled with the long load times, it makes you feel like you just wasted 2 hours of your day waiting, and well, you did.  Most of the video shown below is that of the tutorial or starting areas. I couldn't be bother to record more because, as I said earlier, I ragequit many times. I kept coming back for the review and thinking "it's gotta be because it's beta".\n\nThe combat mechanics are actually really fun. 100% console feel on that. With combo attacks and the way you have to face when attacking, just depicts console game. Which isn't a bad thing, unless you are playing on a PC. When I was playing, it just kept coming to my mind that this game should be played on a PSP GO or something like that. Probably because I've played many games that feel identical to this on my old PSP.\n\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics for this game seem like something out of the 90's. When I saw the opening credits / movie, I thought "ok, its trying to be kinda rustic in the movie." ya well, the game is like that. Imagine Goldeneye 64 meets Team Fortress Classic. Kinda blocky characters with textures that are obviously tiled but not very good. They all have potential to be amazing graphics but just, aren't. The menu's in which you would think static images would be better, aren't. As seen in the picture it just isn't pretty. Maybe they want it that way? I don't think I should be able to see pixelated graphics in a game like this. But I am not the developer. It looks like its trying to be good, but is failing.\n\n\nAudio\n\nThere isn't much to say about the audio. The only audio that I ever heard was that of ambient music in the background and combat sounds. There are almost no voice overs other than the opening movie, mostly everything was done by graphical text. Which was extremely annoying.  The background music does a good job of making you feel immersed into the game but it isn't enough for me to keep me into it.\n\n\nOverall\n\nThis game is free-to-play. So I can't be to harsh on it. Though it seems like I am. It has a lot of potential, but it needs a lot of fine (and not so fine) tuning.  It feels like a bad rip of God of War: Ascension. It is fun for a bit, but the early beta feel is to much for me. Like a lot of free-to-play games, you can pay to win. I don't see a point in that, but, if you want to, you can.\n\nWould I recommend it to others? It's free-to-play so ya. But I wouldn't put to much faith in it.","May 20, 2014","true","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It feels like Darksiders-inspired combat and art style met the Souls' series doom and gloom and constant hungering for souls, with Warhammer Fantasy as the lore backdrop.\n\nYou are an immortal spirit that serves that new gods that lives in the bodies of giants,  'Caos Warriors.' You choose a deity, and try to take over the world in their name. Your choice of deity gives you your narrator, as well as abilities you can learn throughout the course of the campaign. From there, you charge off into the game.\n\nCombat is action style. Combos are very simple at the moment, but I imagine they could add more in the future. You have quick attacks, the number of which you use resulting in different heavy attacks, a block that works against most abilities, a dodge, and your selection of spells. Every once in a while, when prompted, you can also tap E to do a finisher on an enemy to regain HP. More hits without getting hits gets you more combo points, more combo points get you more souls when you kill stuff.\n\nXP from kills gets you levels. Souls buy you weapons, armour, certain spells (most are earned via plot), spell upgrades, and item upgrades, and are also used to repair, and upgrade current items. Now, you CAN buy souls for real money, but store items are randomized and level locked, so that'll only go so far, though...\n\nEvery few levels, you can shed your body and 'Ascend' it, sending it to Crusade on behalf of one of the New Gods. This is not a handwave to explain a new game plus-esque feature. You lose some levels and your inventory. However, you can use your souls to purchase legacy pillars, and add some of your items to your permanent inventory. You also send your body to one of the gods, and it will actually be able to appear as a random bossfight for other players, capable of earning you and your god rewards. You can also realign to a new god at this point, allowing you to mix and match spells.\n\nDungeons are randomized once a day, and a special item must be purchased with souls to enter dungeons not of your alignment. If you follow Void, you can't enter Blood or Light dungeons without buying a Mask of Blood or Mask of Light. Many spawns and bosses are copy pasted, but these encounters aren't bad, per se, and the addition of other players roaming around can lead to some interesting trouble.\n\nYou can see the 'ghosts' of players in the same zones as you are, coloured by their deity alignment. You can use 'curses' to send them more enemies to fight, or 'blessings' to give them bonuses such as more exp or better spell recharge. More in depth co-op and PvP options are also 'planned.'\n\nIt's derivative of a lot of things, but I think it's an interesting game worth the look, and considering the entry price is 'free' and the download isn't even that big, the only thing you've got to lose from giving it a shot is time. I label it as an okay time killer for now, but this is beta, and I could definitely see it growing into more.","May 25, 2014","true","11.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I'm amazed anyone finds it enjoyable.  I'm amazed anyone can beat these without cheating.  Every attack you take flinches you.  You block and retaliate, use a combo with a heavy attack, which the game says to use against blocks to break them, and the AI ignores it.  They don't flinch.  They just start comboing you.  You take damage before animations even begin.  You react to them using a heavy attack, it's instantly blocked.  In fact, everything is instantly blocked.  You actually GET a combo going, you've suddenly taken damage from nothing, and then you're flinching again, until you block, they ignore your heavy, and you're dead.\n\nThis isn't lag.  This is just dumb.  This is some of the absolute worst balance and design of what should be a fun feature.  I tried 30 times.  Even careful, even predicting to my absolute best ability, it just didn't matter.  Combos were impossible to make.  The enemy would simply ignore being attacked, then stop you from being able to attack back.  You'd get something off and somehow they use a heavy strike while being pummeled.  You use a heavy strike?  Flinched out of it.  They're blocking and it lands?  They hit you anyway.

No, it's not. If there's something I must say in favor of the game is that I needed not to purchase a soul pack. I played just fine through the game, never saw any "progress walls", maintained all of my territory under control, all by playing the game normally and not even being actively farming for souls. I understand the game suffered changes with time, and before that might have been a valid critique, but not from what I experienced.\n\nThat said, what I didn't like:\n\nDesign.\nWhile graphically the game isn't terrible (not bleeding edge, but a game isn't just about graphics), something that bugs me is how the sense of scale is very rapidly lost. You're supposed to be a giant, but save the tiny humans nothing really makes you feel so, so it's something of the story you forget soon enough. Also on the design part, dungeons. They're kind of "procedurally generated", but since there's only a dozen segments for the game to pick from dungeons end up feeling repetitive very, very quickly.\n\nChanging rules.\nYou're explained the basics of the game, but no intrinsics on the mechanics, which is usually kind of fair for those games going for a "learn by playing" approach, which would be fine except that this game doesn't allow you to load a save game just before you transcended or something of the sort. Or undo the 20 levels you just climbed. You're never quite told that you have there a tiny margin of time to buy spells from all alignments before you pick a God for the first time (bug? long standing given everyone with a very common build of spells on their Crusade Caos), or how if you choose to ascend later rather than early your next ascencion can only be done at a later than usual level.\nA small mess.\n\nBugs.\nGame is just riddled with them and it's why I mostly give the thumbs down, but this is especially because of people starting out. If you somehow feel you're able to cope with some amount of frustration, then the bugs may not matter to you, because with patience you begin to learn them, know how to cope with and even counter them, to the point they barely make a dent to your game play. I suppose I managed to get to that point which is what kept me playing.\nIf you're easily annoyed by broken attack animations, execution animations that don't freeze enemies in place, and other things that invalidate your skills or reflexes, you might want to take a second thought about diving into this one.\n\nThat said, it's not a terrible game, it just needs much love and care from a developer which is currently tending to something entirely different.","May 27, 2015","false","65.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I very much enjoyed it and even supported the game by purchasing souls, even though I felt they were a bit pricey, the game had a charm to it that simply grasped my attention. I foresaw this game becoming something big; it has such potential story wise. Giving it a go on PC a year later, I see nothing but the same unpolished game as I saw on the 360. What happened? Did they just say "forget this game" and leave it running to collect money from people buying souls?\n\nI start the game only to constantly be invaded, as a level 3-5, by other players between the levels of 13-17, which makes absolutely no sense. I can't hold my own territories to gain souls which keeps me pushed back as a player. When I finally am able to claim a damn territory, its invaded 5 minutes later by not just one, but two enemies, I could have sworn they fixed this error on the xbox...\n\nThis is inexcusable, to anyone looking to check this game out; I'd suggest just playing the game casually, without ever putting money into it, because obviously the support they get goes to their wallets, and not the production and further advancement of this game.","August 5, 2015","false","3.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

I eventually deleted it because of long load times but, I'm glad that that isn't the case with the PC version. The graphics are good and the gameplay is a hack and slash kind of like Ninja Gaiden. My one problem is the keyboard and mouse controls, the original key bindings make you use the entire keyboard so you have to move your hand off the WASD keys and the mouse pointer felt a little stiff. I would recommend getting an Xbox 360 controller because those controls are perfect. Sometimes bosses can be hard but they always have a set area to where you can just move in and out the area and use your spells to kill the boss.

The unfailry buffed hp bar, move set which is too agile for big monsters and I dont understand why blocking doesnt really do you good as it breaks and still damages you. You may say "Oh you just need skills to do beat bosses", 50% of that is true, but each time i dodge sprint (because there is no dodge roll) an attack, i can't go back in for hits because the recoil time for the boss' attack is fast and I'd say ♥♥♥♥ you if you tell me I'm just noob coz I finished dark souls 1 & 2.\n\nGraphics looks ok, but i get low frame rates on my laptop. I run dark souls 2 in high fine with 30fps but here i get sub 20 in a clash of skills type of scenario with maxed up settings and lowering it doesnt get me up to 40+ fps.\n\nI understand it's in beta so I'm giving it a 4-5/10\nthere is much much more to improve on but this game packs potential.\n\nGiving this a "Not recommend" until fixes are done.","July 27, 2014","false","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After sideing with a god you then go on a series of missions, and wanting to get ever stronger the game quickly turns into wanting you to spend money to get good, I've spent quite a lot, and while it's fun, ultimately the games Ascending screws you over with paying. Ascending is somewhat flawed at the moment and I believe it's being worked on, but the fact that you pay quite a bit for points, and you lose them all so fast only to be forced to ascend past a level cap and lose the things you spent the points on (that you didn't sell) is fairly un-fair.\n\nOn a different note - the game is somewhat lonely, you have human allies and enemies, their neat and it's cool when some of them have actual roles and personalities in the campaign, but this is a big world, and your human allies are sort of just human allies, no magic, just some swords, spears, and bows. Enemy humans are actually allied with the enemy Titan's minions and it seems rather unfair you never get to see those same minions on your side, while you can still send them to attack other players on a plane seperate from yours. It's sort of like the game is teaseing you in that regard.\n\nA caos is basically a super-sized human with tons of power and some cannibalistic tastes, you can actually eat anything tiny, includeing your own allies, considering the campaigns premise that there is a gigantic war going on, you hardly ever see any actual war, between the human tribes or even the monsters, not even any rival monster battles, to show the intensity of the situation. Generally you just see neat little skirmishes.\n\nCaos are tanks that destroy everything and their by themselves, it would be nice to have to take down one of your big boss enemies, meanwhile get to sit back and sorta watch units fight, atleast as a passtime that is kinda enjoyable, or see the humans more active in say, trying to attack or press forward into enemy territory or do something by themselves, just for atmospheric purposes.\n\nThis game is awesome, but it is still in Beta, and for a Beta, it's pretty awesome, I would deffinately reccommend this, but just know how stuff is layed out in the game at the moment, a lot of stuff seems like a money grab, and the game gets fairly repetitive and boaring after a bit, which was why I was giveing some ideas to make it more interesting and enjoyable c: I hope that atleast someone finds this helpful or interesting, or gives the game developers some ideas, because this game is great, but how it is right now needs work.\n\n\n7.5/10 ^^","June 10, 2014","true","15.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After a few hours worth of gameplay you practically NEED to spend money on souls (ingame currency) in order to upgrade your gear / buy new gear, otherwise anything will kill you in a matter of seconds and bosses become a giant kitefest that relies on your ranged abilities to wear them down. You CAN grind for the souls (main reason i'm still recommending this game) but it takes AGES to get anywhere near the amounts you need to get any decent gear.\n\nAll in all i'd give the game an 8/10, it's a betagame with huge potential but the sharp drop from feeling overpowered to being shred to pieces in seconds is kind of a turnoff, especially since you need to grind for a couple of hours to get anywher near the amount of souls needed for a piece of upgraded gear.","October 13, 2014","true","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Really, REALLY fun. Sure, it has an in game shop that CAN lessen the time you pass in game, actually doing GAME STUFF (This game is all about territory and rebirthing your character to lose a few levels in exchange for more power and an increased level cap, so obviously rushing through the story is NOT the right way to play, rather, you should claim territory, defend it against other players pledged to other gods who want to steal it and then rebirth, changing allegiance to another god then your old one, and retaking all your territory from the ones who were once your comrades.) and skip right to kicking ♥♥♥, but even if you don't, it is quite possible to be more powerfull then someone pouring in hundreds of bucks by pouring in an equal ammount of time.\n\nPros:\n\n-Interesting story\n-Fun PVP system that blends in flawlessly\n-Unique point of view (Well yeah, you're a giant who eats humans to restore health... Nice to not be a bad guy but not be a good guy either in an MMO for once)\n-Fun and intuitive combat system\n-Easy to get into, even if you never played this kind of game before.\n\nCons:\n\n-Real money shop IS a little invasive, nothing like everquest popups though\n-The learning curve is quite steep, making the game rather hard (But some people love that, the souls serie is my proof)\n-Some players can be trolls, sending high power monsters into your instance of the world, possibly forcing you to grind more then normally required\n-Combat and the territorial system are not very explained, but just enough that you can play.","December 25, 2014","true","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay is enjoyable and the graphics aren't too bad. In fact the visuals remind me a lot of the Darksiders games. I did have an issue the first time I played where the game would crash after 5-10 minutes of play, but it only occured three times in a row and hasn't happened again since that first play session. One thing I would really like to see as this approaches becoming a finished product is for the combat to be fleshed out more but as it is now it is still enjoyable if a bit repetitive.","May 24, 2014","true","10.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I love the looting and the fact that you really don't have to spend a dime to get what you want, Just hit the Endless Dungeon. Eating and throwing ur food is comical. You are not tied to just one alignment. When you ascend you can change alignments and get spells from that one as well. This allows you to ultimately decide what are all the spells you want to use.\n\nSpeaking of ascending. Basically what that entails is that you decide you have made ur character strong enough to survive the war between the gods as an NPC. You have to make a certain number of levels to ascend and I recommend you save up at least 31k souls. This way you can pass your gear to all your newer characters everytime you ascend as a legacy item.

Yes I'd recommend buying an actual hack & slash game instead.\n\n----------\n\nThis game tries too hard to be both Dark Souls and God of War.\n\nIt's like God of War in the combat and most of the ambience. It even has some slightly "grotesque" interactive kills, but falls short on the combo variation. Seriosuly, the two available combos are: x, x, x, x, y (and variations of) or y, y\nthe x, x... combo covers pretty much what feels like 360 degrees around you.\n\nIt's like Dark Souls partly in the interactivity between players. You'll even see spirit outlines of players near you. They can either benefit you or hurt you.\nIt falls short on the fact that you can't directly interact with other players. You can either summon enemies or buffs they have to interact with.\nAll interactions are, of course, single-use. I had about 6 "schminvasions" in my inventory and I threw 4 of them at one random guy. I saw him struggle for a bit and then I sent him an exp buff and a magic refresh buff.\nI saw him die from a different monster.\n\nAnother version of interactivity is, you "delete" your guy and it becomes a phantom, which attacks other people's shrines.\nYou'll constantly have to defend your captured zones from AI controlled players that are well-geared. The AI will spam attacks and magic and is, in general, a very hard fight, which would be a welcome event if it weren't so damn common.\n\nThe game tells you that your monsters "interacting" with other players gives you bonuses, but I didn't see anything.\n\nCombat is extremely simplistic, and while you'll hear "different weapons have different combos". In my experience, all the weapons have the exact same combo with slight speed and reach variations.\n\nThe monetization scheme is dangerous. It's subtle enough that you'll buy a handful of (DARK!) souls once and you'll trivialize it over time so that, before long, you'll have spent $100, $200 in nothing but a handful of weapons or armor you'll discard eventually.\n\n\nI heard from other reviewers that there's a possibility to run out of souls for repair and have broken equipment, leaving you unable to gather the required souls to repair, unable as well to delete your character. Basically, an economy black hole.","October 9, 2014","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After a few hours worth of gameplay you practically NEED to spend money on souls (ingame currency) in order to upgrade your gear / buy new gear, otherwise anything will kill you in a matter of seconds and bosses become a giant kitefest that relies on your ranged abilities to wear them down. You CAN grind for the souls (main reason i'm still recommending this game) but it takes AGES to get anywhere near the amounts you need to get any decent gear.\n\nAll in all i'd give the game an 8/10, it's a betagame with huge potential but the sharp drop from feeling overpowered to being shred to pieces in seconds is kind of a turnoff, especially since you need to grind for a couple of hours to get anywher near the amount of souls needed for a piece of upgraded gear.","October 13, 2014","true","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In Hand of Kul you’re a Caos, a giant being that humans revere to be the heralds of gods. Awesome idea! I’m a giant you can call upon my human subjects and have them fire upon my foes. Awesome. Pay for souls so as to buy up all the good gear and make yourself almost unstoppable. Less awesome. Combat that starts out cool but soon gets repetitive. Less awesome. Your gear degrades so fast you’d swear that it was made of turkey bone instead of steel. Less awesome.\n\nIt’s things like these that hold back this game into being something really great. The story in it is less than gripping and also a little off putting. I get summoned down from the heavens, a giant prepared to be clad in armor, armed with a great axe, and spread the influence of my Patron god… only to immediately realize that the Titan, the main villain towers over you like a parent over their child, their magically inclined, axe wielding child, but a child none the less. Then you come to find that the majority of enemies you face are only a little smaller than you some, like the Titan, are much bigger than you. And also all of the dungeons you enter are several times larger than you. Perhaps it could be the lore of the game that they were built by other beings like the Caos, but you never really feel the weight of your size that often, or at all because you’re crawling through a dungeon bigger than you, opening chests just the right size for you and fighting enemies just as big or bigger than you.\n\nThat’s not to say that the game isn’t fun. Far from it. It can be fun to fight through enemies in rather basic combat, it can be fun to invoke the spells of your god, raining punishment on your foes. All in all if the game cost twenty bucks on steam, I’d tell you to wait for it to go on sale during the summer or winter. But I don’t need to tell you that. The game is FREE. Some would say that the game isn’t because of the pay2win mechanics going on but it is free. You are required to pay nothing to play this game. Your gear may degrade fast but there are forge’s to which you may repair all your currently equipped gear while you’re not playing. Because of this I feel that Hand of Kul is a game you play in bursts. Free as it is, play it once. Find it’s just not your cup of tea just uninstall it, nothing lost.\nAs it is though, Hand of Kul is an okay game with some problems; at the price of free it’s worth at least a glance.\n","May 30, 2015","true","22.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Because everything involving this game revolves around a currency that can be bought with real world money. Skills, weapons, armor, runes (which are used to enhance armor, but once socketed to an armor piece they can not be removed for use with new armor), weapon and armor upgrading, and buffs (yes... you are charged for buffs). I will mention that the prices for things are pretty ridiculous and you will be grinding. Also, if you pay with real money expect to get a meager amount for your purchase that allows you to most likely get one or two items or to not even fully upgrade one skill (unless you're insane and willing to spend $100s on the game...).\n\nYou will also be constantly repairing your gear, another cost, which isn't cheap when you suddenly find yourself with 2-4 almost broken pieces of gear.\n\nThe other negative part worth mentioning about the game is that it is super instanced and you will constantly be seeing a loading screen. That and the graphics are super outdated looking, it's as if I've rewound time every time I play this game and have suddenly gone back to 2008. Textures are really, really ugly for a 2015 game.\n\nI would honestly not suggest this game.

Firstly, played this game on my old 360 all the time loved it there so trust me the 4.3 hour u see here add that to the 1k hours on the 360 version. Next thing is honestly this isnt a p2w game because its not true pvp u fight the image of a ascended champion not the actual champion. I was a leaderboard ascended on the xbox so trust me never payed a dime to play it to become number 1 on the leader board i just did so. This game is a very fun action rpg try it out and u will see.

Combat is good,nothing groundbreaking but good,bunch of combos for melee and you can spice things up with spells of your choosing,they are locked to a faction but they do carry over whenever you ascend your character,ascending creates new character and destroys the old one,allowing you to carry 1 item over and letting you choose faction again.\nThere is no real time pvp,only pvp is done against bots that have the body of previously ascended character of a player,but not player himself.\nI remember spending about 15 euros on this game back on console and did not run out of ingame cash anytime soon, I have not played the game recently but I HOPE this would still be the case,if they went buy to win somewhere along the line then it would be a terrible shame,as it stands from my experience I can recommend the game.","May 24, 2015","true","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In Hand of Kul you’re a Caos, a giant being that humans revere to be the heralds of gods. Awesome idea! I’m a giant you can call upon my human subjects and have them fire upon my foes. Awesome. Pay for souls so as to buy up all the good gear and make yourself almost unstoppable. Less awesome. Combat that starts out cool but soon gets repetitive. Less awesome. Your gear degrades so fast you’d swear that it was made of turkey bone instead of steel. Less awesome.\n\nIt’s things like these that hold back this game into being something really great. The story in it is less than gripping and also a little off putting. I get summoned down from the heavens, a giant prepared to be clad in armor, armed with a great axe, and spread the influence of my Patron god… only to immediately realize that the Titan, the main villain towers over you like a parent over their child, their magically inclined, axe wielding child, but a child none the less. Then you come to find that the majority of enemies you face are only a little smaller than you some, like the Titan, are much bigger than you. And also all of the dungeons you enter are several times larger than you. Perhaps it could be the lore of the game that they were built by other beings like the Caos, but you never really feel the weight of your size that often, or at all because you’re crawling through a dungeon bigger than you, opening chests just the right size for you and fighting enemies just as big or bigger than you.\n\nThat’s not to say that the game isn’t fun. Far from it. It can be fun to fight through enemies in rather basic combat, it can be fun to invoke the spells of your god, raining punishment on your foes. All in all if the game cost twenty bucks on steam, I’d tell you to wait for it to go on sale during the summer or winter. But I don’t need to tell you that. The game is FREE. Some would say that the game isn’t because of the pay2win mechanics going on but it is free. You are required to pay nothing to play this game. Your gear may degrade fast but there are forge’s to which you may repair all your currently equipped gear while you’re not playing. Because of this I feel that Hand of Kul is a game you play in bursts. Free as it is, play it once.

However the gameplay can get repetitive after a while. All this games needs is a wider variety of enemies to face, even if the difference is merely aesthetic. And also a wider variety of move sets that change based on what kind of weapon you have. I.e sword weapons have a certain move set as opposed to a blunt, or axe weapon. Otherwise it's a pretty good game.","May 29, 2015","true","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Firstly, played this game on my old 360 all the time loved it there so trust me the 4.3 hour u see here add that to the 1k hours on the 360 version. Next thing is honestly this isnt a p2w game because its not true pvp u fight the image of a ascended champion not the actual champion. I was a leaderboard ascended on the xbox so trust me never payed a dime to play it to become number 1 on the leader board i just did so. This game is a very fun action rpg try it out and u will see.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/codamadius/recommended/233630/","codamadius","Frillin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/codamadius/","139 products in account","Ascend: Hand of Kul is a mixture of Darksiders and Dark Souls combined with its own unique twist. Some people would probably say God of War but so far I've only had one quick time event....and that was pressing X. It was pretty intense and I nearly failed it (yes I'm being sarcastic). The good thing about Ascend is they don't shove buying souls on you. So far I've made the mistake of spending a ton of souls on instantly repairing my gear without knowing there was a repair station at the Sanctuary. Of course it'll take a whole lot longer but it beats being desperate for souls. There doesn't seem to be any real story to this game other than the fact that you're a Caos who pledges himself to a God and can ascend into another life and be "reborn". Your goal is to take shrines and towns and spread darkness, light, or void across them. Each God has his/her own perks and drawbacks.\n\nThe combat system again is a lot like Darksiders. Some low health enemies can be executed for a small health boost and it all works on an X, Y combo system. I don't know how it works for PC controls since I plugged in my 360 controller and this is how I play. Bosses can be very annoying if you're backed into a corner or just knocked down. Which is where the Dark Souls bit kicks in. Small enemies easily stagger you and big bosses easily knock you to the ground. When at low health your Caos will limp making it a lot harder to get away and stay alive. The most unique thing about this game is you can use your worshippers to attack enemies and eat them to keep your health up...and throw them because it's kind of funny. Puny humans.\n\nThis game requires an internet connection like Dark Souls; and you can see other players in your region and know who joins and leaves but you cannot directly affect them. In order to help or cause other players harm you need to have a blessing or a curse or you can use your ascended Caos' to attack areas taken over by the other two opposing Gods.\n\nOverall, it's really good for being in beta and can say it'll be one of the best free to play games on the market. The only problem I've had is periods of freezing for a short time and I did crash once while desecrating a shrine (heh that rhymed). I recommend downloading this game and can't wait for what the final product will bring.","May 23, 2014","true","9.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Highly addicting I just Can't seemed to put it down.\n\nPro - Great RPG/Hack and slash fun.\nPro - Leveling up dosen't take forever and the ascend ability is awesome (My Opinion)\nPro - Wide variety of leaderboars Just about everthing you do from eating a human to getting a 10x hit combo there is a leaderboard for it. (which also makes the game even more addictive)\n\nCon - As it is still in beta I seem to disconnect frequently this is very annoying while in dungeons or fighting big bosses.\nCon - Sometimes can get frustrating a little bit of repatision in the game story play.\n\nAltogether - Well Alltoghether this game in my opinion is fantastic I can a sure all people reading this I will be a long term player. If you like RPGS or Hack and slash Brutal games give this game a try. Even if you end up not liking it it's free not like your gonna have to pay any money. Also If you download and fall in love with the game its a game for live you didn't have to spend a penny on. Guys if I where you I would pick this game up and give it a go for an hour or so.\n\nIf not you might regret it.

First thing, is that the game is a very challenging game and you should not play it if you think its gonna be flippin World of Warcraft. This game has very odd mechanics that make me sooooooooo mad. This game is not a pay to win, but their are many mini transactions. One of the main mechanics in the game is that you can send enemies to someone else in your same area but in a different dimension (Void, Light, Chaos all have their own dimension).These enemies are so difficult, especcialy when there are those people who grind for days or pay real money to send boss-like creatures at you, that makes me infuriated when I'm at a lower level. Apart from that one thing, the monsters themselves are difficult as crap. There was a section I had to pass that had maybe 10 creatures? Yeah I though 10 was a meabsly number, I walk out there and get killed almost instantly :(. The point is that this game has some wonky mechanics but very fun ones at the same time. The thing that makes me infuriated the most is how fast your armor breaks... I'm just gonna stop before I get into that.","June 23, 2015","true","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

First, Ascend is a 3D beat'em up with special powers. The powers are fairly weak (even after I spent most of the free souls you get with a new account upgrading the first power, it just didn't do much damage or provide more than a couple seconds of stun), so I don't know why they even bother having them. They have cooldowns and are very expensive to upgrade, so it stands to reason that they would be powerful, but this just isn't the case. . .  and that's a shame because the ONLY thing that is different in character progression between you and any other character is which one of 3 gods you choose to follow. This choice will follow you through the game as it determines which special powers your character gets. Other than that, you get different combos based on the type of weapon you use. . .  and that's it.\n\nPlus, while there are a handful of character customization options, you won't actually see them because your character wears different armor. There is no body-scaling or choices between different types of Caos warriors, so you'll always play as a hulking steroid-monkey in thick battle armor. It would be great if there was more variety. . .  maybe your Caos is a beautiful female archer or a cute but-lightning-quick rogue kid who is all about dodging and setting up vicious surprise attacks.\n\nBasically, the ideas of Ascend are great, but they just didn't put enough into it to make it great. This shows in their pay-model too. Instead of having the ability to buy more gameplay options like mounts, different character classes, etc. the player can basically buy the in-game currency for power-ups (souls). This means the game is literally pay-2-win. While I personally don't have a problem with that in MMOs that focus on PvE, I do have a problem with it in MMOs that have elements of PvP.","January 27, 2015","false","5.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Can I reccomend this game to others? Certainly! Although, not everyone would enjoy it fully.\n\nThe game itself puts you in control of a being known as a Caos. Upon choosing from one of three gods (the gods represent the Dark, Void, and Light), you are sent out into the human world to bring down the reign of a massive creature known as the Titan, a former god who constantly devours humans and souls to stay alive. By capturing areas of the map through the raising of shrines and desecating of village altar, you bring your god's will and control to the area, driving the Titan further and further away from the main parts of the map.\n\nThe combat is similar to God of War, where timing your actions is important to winning an encounter, whether it be with the weak yet numerous troll warriors, or the massive hulking ogres that protect certain sites for the Titan. There's no jumping, and there are not any ways to speed up your progress through a level other than to have decent gear.\n\nSpeaking of gear: The armor and weapons in this game can be obtained in one of two ways. You can either find them while exploring the world and opening the chests they often hide in, or by purchasing them from the shop with souls recieved from the slying of enemies and also from chests. Souls CAN be bought with real-world money, which often puts certain players at a greater advantage, but the pay-to-win structure is VERY minimal, as you can find similar or better pieces of arms and armor out in the world. You can also use souls to upgrade your gear, as well as spells you obtain as you go. Depending on how you spend your souls, you can create a decent character WITHOUT the need to break out your credit card, something I've not done so far witht his game.\n\nSo, what is there to like about this game?\n\nThere's plenty to like. The surroundings change depending on which god controls which area, so a reather drab troll-held region will be far different from that of a void-held region, so it often gives a change in scenery (if you like that sort of thing). The villages are almost fully destructable, and the villagers and their warriors can be thrown, eaten, smashed, thrown off of your body...Yeah, these little guys have saved my skin on multiple occasions.\n\nCombat is pretty straight forward in most cases, but the minibosses often require finesse and strategy to defeat. Bosses also test you,your character, and, on many occasions, your patience. Some are pretty powerful, even for a Caos with great gear.\n\nSome things I didn't particularly like are the camera controls and the way some encounters play out. Because I played this game first on the 360, I am used to a controller (something this game, thankfully, supports). And, correct me if I'm wrong, but the camera controls on this port are a bit more touchy and wonky in some places. Encounters can also be rather repetitive and a little overwhelming as the number of enemies can double in an encounter if you accidentaly  fight close to another group of enemies.\n\nWhile that's all I can personally complain about, the PvP also deserves (grudgingly) my respect. Instead of attacking another player directly, you have to use Crusade Spells to either curse or, if you're feeling generous, bless another player. You can send enemies from your world to another, create enhanced versions of the same creatures in their world, even give them boosts and protections. It depends on your personal taste.\n\nFinally, the main component of the game, Ascension. After you reach level five and clear Crimhold Summit (the tutorial area, basically), you can send the current form of your Caos to be Ascended, and to fight on your behalf in the Crusade. Whatever gear you Ascend with is what that version of you will use, and will be taken from you. UNLESS you make them into Legacy items, which you can spend souls on to make them available to all of the Caos you create later on down the road. It's a nifty feature, but spending souls to unloack Legacy slots in the Ascending area can be troublesome.\n\nOnce you've Ascended, you'll be given the opportunity to re-equip and rename your next Caos, and also choose to serve a new God. In the 360 version, I served the Light exclusively. This port? The Void. Because those spells are pretty flashy.\n\nBut this is my opinion. If you choose to download this game, go right ahead! It's free to play, so you won't be losing any money on it (unless you buy souls), and it's a game you can jump into for almost any length of time.\n\nSo, if you download it, I'll see you out there, whether it be on the same side, or on the other end of a raided village.","June 29, 2014","true","6.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Well apparently not, every time I did the same to them, I watched them kill everything within a few seconds, so it's my gear that might be the problem, I then look through the store, and since I'm already getting tired of getting beat down, and have no intention of playing, I decided to get the best gear my little pathetic starter pile of souls would get me, and sure enough, I started one-hitting everything and those guys who were laughing at me, then decided to find the next completely free player in the worst, and possibly broken gear.\nWell that's nice, since people don't mess with me now, maybe I can actually try play the game, right? No. I started noticing how quickly the gear actually got worn down, it's not TOO bad if you're constantly on top of it, but what kind of normal person enjoys playing a game where they get more anxiety about when their gear breaks, than if they're going to get ambushed by a person who wants to mess with you? I find that a little ridiculous.\nAlso, the prices of such are insane, I went onto the store to see how much cash I would actually have to spend, per hour, to continue playing with the best gear for the level cap, and also repairing it and such, and it can actually be pretty hefty of a price to just run around in a rather unpolished game, which is so mindnumbingly dull, both about graphics and control.\nAbout the graphics, it really bothers me that the developers seem to keep forgetting about the scaling of the world around me, regular farming tools are the size of what I would expect a 6-ox driven siege machine, grass tickles my knees and most of the trees are just way too tall compared to how large humans actually are, I DO know some trees can grow amazingly tall, but I would like to see some variation.\nAnimation is too flat and lifeless, I can't go in depth more than that, there's no charm, no atmosphere, nothing, it lacks soul.\n\nIt bothers me that the one thing that seems to be the most finished, is the cash store at this point in time, I have beta tested many games that ended up going that route, and every time a game did, it quickly became a cash grabbing monstrosity which then slowly died off as it scared people away. I have witnessed many of my old favorites getting bought up by very large corporations too, altering the stores, making everything a tad more predatory as the updates slowly roll in, seeing it bleed out the exact same way.\n\nI'm not paying for this, and obviously it makes a huge difference if you do, so I won't play.","June 1, 2015","false","0.7"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","3"

To put this in comparison, you gain ~30 souls for selling a weapon, but to repair a weapon it costs ~1000+ souls....  balanced? I think not...\n\nThe game constantly flashes gear on your screen each time you level up which is aparently your level, but costs far more "souls" then you will ever receive normally leaving you feeling a bit dissapointed and feeling a bit underpowered at every point in the game.\n\nIt also gives a "fake" sense of multiplayer by having you fight oponents with real user names, but are controlled by the AI which is a bit odd. Sometimes you can see transparent "ghosts" of other players in your world, and can slightly interact with them by spawning enemies in their world....however to do this you have to spend souls...and there is no real rewards for doing this other than to laugh as they run from monsters...\n\nHowever.... all negatives aside I had a great time playing alongside a friend (even though we were in seperate worlds), and felt like it was a good experience. The combat was pretty generic for a hack and slash, but the interesting levels, unique abilities, constant new gear, and challenging bosses kept it interesting.\n\nNot sure if I'll play this again though as it seems like the further you go, the harder it is to progress without paying IRL money for virtual currency.\n\nI highly reccomend picking up Vikings: Battle for Asgard, a very similar style game with a lot more action, a storyline, epic battles with tons of enemies, and a overall better experience.

If you don't, the game gets harder, but not *that* much. I, for an instance, got to level 8 with no problems while using up 5k souls worth of armor and weaponry.\nNeutral point: it is hard to get that amount of souls back. Impossible? No. Hard.\nPositive points:\n- Nice graphics.\n- Nice RPG-like system. (Weaponry, Armors, etc)\nNegative points:\n- The combat system is bad. There are "big" monsters you have to face sometimes, and because they have (much) more health than you do, and inflict (much) more damage than your puny bone-sword does, the immediate strategy would be to wait for it to swing it's gigantic club, then get behind, strike as many times as you can, then sprint to the other side, before he has the chance to strike again. Don't even try. If you do, chances are your sprint will throw you *towards* him.  Even if you somehow manage to escape his range,... he will still hit you. Bugs FTW.\n- The music is colossaly repetitive.\n-  UI is confusing.\n- Controls are confusing.\n- A bug happens when you try to load the game for the first time: It minimizes and enters window mode. Then, when you try to change to "fullscreen mode"... it minimizes again, and reenters window mode.\n\nAn overall nice concept, and a nice RPG-system... but that needs a lot of sandpapering.","July 18, 2015","false","2.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

You can buy as little as $3 worth of in-game money.

I feel that the aesthetic of the game just screams God of War, or even Darksiders. I hear a lot of people saying Darksouls but I will admit it was not the first thing that had come to mind when I started. The combat is good, the story is good, overall I have yet to find any major flaw with the game.Overall I just hope we see more features added to the game, more character customization, more game modes, pvp, co-op, female characters, the whole "shebang" In the end all I can do is hope for a prosperous future for Ascend: Hand of Kul, and urge you to try it, its really not bad.\n\n*Update: 6/1/14  We have gotten quite a few balancing updates and bug fixes so some of the launch issues are already fixed, nows a great time to try the game.\n\n*Update 5/13/15 The game has been on hiatus for quite some time now, the future looks grim.","May 22, 2014","true","25.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The only complaint I have thus far is getting kicked offline after I completed so much, and having to start over. :/ Atleast I stayed my level and kept my armor :)\n\nUDPATE: So, after playing it for a little bit, I realised that this truly is a "Wait, or pay" game! Say your weapon just broke, and you have no money to repair it. Now you have to either wait real time, which is about 47 hours, or you could buy souls with real money and fix it now. This game lost my vote just because of their repair system.\n\nUPDATE#2: So after some time, I decided to give it another go. This time, I was at the VERY end of the getting the Apex skull in that ridiculously long dungeon, and it shut down. Unknown error.

The game lagged worse than my flying carps (5.2 carpawatts more to be exact) all throughout the character creation.\n\nPros and Cons (Sorry, guys, I know this is a bit cliche for steam reviewers):\n+ It's free - you can have all the lag you want FOR FREE!!!\n+ It looked really nice - especially when I paused the game and stood still.\n+ The concept of the game is good - I've never played a game that involved screaming at your computer before.\n+ Your character is a megagiant monster dude - you'll love playing with him!\n+ This game will make your computer lag in a way you never thought possible (settings can't save you now)\n+ You probably won't make it through the intro - I almost selected my god. How far can you get?\n+ It will be a challenge to have fun while multitasking with this game and something else. You may even get the family involved with the fun of screaming at the game and trying to get it to work while you finish watching your Justice League cartoons.\n+ The main menu is great.\n- people keep giving this game bad reviews and a bad report, but it deserves so much more - join in the fun and scream along. I only wish more people played this game.\n\nThanks for reviewing my review!!!","June 23, 2015","true","0.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I am sure they workded hard on this game, but I am tired of C calling for 30 mintues, and cannot get through the, ummm hot tar wall. That's about all the patience I had. Little fellows come, jump on me, went back fought in the arena again, came back in Called somemore. I guess I missed it, but was stuck there, running in circles. Finally I just used the fishing pole and went fishing for a while, and then manicured my toenails till I was bored to death. BUT, it is free, so have fun, (shaking my head, rolling my eyes).\n\nPeace","December 18, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The notion that the character desing is sorta playfull and bulky anime type and that the gore and violence is explicit to the max- sort of gives a mix feeling about this game -which isnt good. The character desing and the levels are to say the least revoltingly grotesque and the level of blood on gore displayed mixed with over the top demon like characters with huge horns and scull like faces, and the concept of being a giant ancients god servant that uses humans as food, gunfodder ect is preaty exagarated to the level of sick. Normaly the character Khul or Kal or Kul -or King Kul was Robert Howards precursor characters for the Conan character- and this game brings that kinda wibe to a "bloody pokemon" level of view. Considering gameplay the game is action based and recquires moderate use of skill in movement and use of variety of diferent momentary tactics but with using basic tehniques of combat present in the game -and especially kiting bosses to open up so you can dps them then kite again -you can speedrun relatively fast trought the game. Shame that the multiplayer part is mostly control point based and there is a lot of grind both from the cloned characters as the high level on low level fights-which can slow your progress in the game. The Miniboses are actually more chalenging than the bosses of the levels- but you can always dash around them with wall hughing method and save time. Althou the combat itself is quite stationary in a sense youre instant traped - the dash atacks and evadings become a boring method for stronger monsters -and the blocking of atacks can often leave you stagered and swarmed by creatures. (the beastery in the game is not that various or rich -the same creatures repeat to show up over and over as level feed) . The crusade feature is an intreseting concept in the game- since it leaves a clone of you at a spot to fight players when you are offline. But the conotations of canibalism and a wrecking ball barbarian allthou they seem to be put for comic effect -kinda surpass that level and become revolting since the concept is forced trough and repeatable to the level of dank monothony. The achivments in the game are quite easy to do and they pop up themselfs without trying. Yeah but the inital idea of the game is a very old concept in gaming just broth to the next level and beyond a cliff. The level of grotesque blood spiling scenes and terrifying horor enemies -over the top -and the bad multiplayer really turn me back from this game and it is why i do not recomend it, its true that these elements are common in these type of games but here there exagarated in a bad way. So Ascending in Hand of Kul is actually descending into numbness in RL.\n\n;-}","March 10","false","9.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","7"
