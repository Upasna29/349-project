Obviously, as an American, my study habits are different than that of a Chinese student. Comparing Gaokao to something like the SAT test is a world of difference. So for my playthrough of the game, I played it exactly like I do school in real life.\n\nIn the beginning, I had it all. The girlfriend, Muxin, friends, and generally nothing to worry about except the first Simulation test, which was about 30 days away. There were a surprisingly large amount of activities to choose from when free time was available, so I thought that the game likely wanted me to see what it had to offer. How wrong I was. After about 30 days of a happy, cute, almost relaxing little game of high-school antics, I screwed up on the first Simulation test. After all, I had barely studied at all during my free time.\n\nThe tone shift after messing up that test was jarring. The music pretty much ceased altogether, except for this haunting song that played rather frequently when I would have arguments with my dissapointed parents. Muxin wasn't the same either, as her score was rather low as well. Marsh used to be a nice kid, after all, I was the one making his decisions for the most part. After the arguments got more and more intense (to the point where coming home was dreaded), I was no longer able to study. It wasn't my decision any more, it was my character, Marsh, taking the wheel. The arguments got worse. Marsh needed to bring up the test scores, and after talking with Muxin and deciding that the RELATIONSHIP was likely the reason for the low scores, Marsh dumped Muxin after screaming at her about his feelings. I (the player obviously) had no say in this. And the arguments kept getting worse. Marsh's father eventually smacked him a few times.\n\nThe game was now very depressing. After sleeping outside under a bridge, he finally slipped from all that I had made him. If China wanted him to focus on the test and nothing else, it succeeded. Marsh snapped. Test problems became his entire life for the next 50 days. Grades sky-rocketed, but all of the old characters were nowhere to be seen and health was declining.\n\nEventually, after not eating for days, Marsh collapsed. And I was given a decision after a LONG time. Whatever I did, I picked the right thing, because Muxin, Xiaohan, and Stom saved him, and Marsh was back where he belonged.\n\nIn the end, I got a decent score and had no girlfriend.\n\nThis game was an emotional rollercoaster, and it's not just an "anime game", it's WAY more than that. I HIGHLY recommend it, and I'll be playing through it again very soon.","November 5, 2015","true","10.6"," 135 of 139 people (97%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","97","135","139","13","6"

I've played several Dating sims/Galgames, but it's never been my cup of tea, so to speak. The whole idea felt interesting yet impractical, I didn't expect much from this game when my friend recommended it me. This game however, is a whole another deal.\n\nCurrently a college student, the feelings of being a high schooler still lingers inside, and this game has brought it all back. Once again it hit me: the insecurities, the increasing pressure of schoolwork, the overwhelming want for some love, the struggles, and the urge to be live up to your parents' expectations, your peers' expectations, and perhaps most importantly, your own expectations. Throughout the game there come times where it was too emotionally difficult for me to continue playing and I had to pull myself away for a minute or two. You might be skeptical about how I can be so immersed into a seemingly simple game, and yes, I was skeptical about it afterwards. But if there are teenage memories that you still held dear, play this game and all those will come alive again.\n\nI’ve played countless Galgames that are simply made to give the player pleasure out of playing them. You start the game for 30 minutes and suddenly all 25 girls in the game are devoted to you. Of course, that is an exaggeration, but you get my point. This game is an entirely different ballpark: it’s realistic. Consequences come when you least expect them, and you have to work hard to pull off anything. Sometimes there can, and will be times where you just can’t do anything about the horrible situation no matter how hard you work, and that’s just the way it is. Yes, it is extremely frustrating and stressful, but isn’t that just like real life?\n\nNever have I in the course of only a few hours, experienced so many emotions. I was so ecstatic and overjoyed during the good times that I caught myself smiling at the screen like an idiot several times. But multiple times my head ached and stomach churned from stress that applied onto me through the main character’s words. When Muxin broke up with me (Sorry, spoiler alert, but this is only one out of 50 ways that the story could go), even though it’s temporary, I couldn’t stop tears from trickling down my cheeks when all these pressure from teachers/parents/myself that I’ve been enduring was for her. Heck, there are so many times when I said something in response to the situation, and the “me” I’m playing as in the game says the exact same thing right as I clicked through the text. This game really digs deep inside, and I can testify to that.\n\nOf course, there are still flaws to this game. In my opinion, I was able to be so immersed in the game because I understood Chinese. The voice acting was spectacular (even though could be cringeworthy at times, yes I’m talking about Stom), but if you couldn’t understand what people are talking about, it really takes you away from the experience. Also, multiple translation problems are still present in game. From what I remember (which is not much, since I was so absorbed), the use of auxiliary verbs felt funny, even awkward to me. For example:\n“Why she do that?” or “Why I need to go to school today?”\nShould be something like “Why would she do that?” or “Why do I need to go to school today?”.\nNotice without those auxiliary verbs, the meaning can change drastically. “Why would she do that?” does not equal “Why did she do that?”. I don’t have the Chinese manuscript so I wouldn’t know the real intention, but this is something I would like to see fixed, because without these little details, we aren’t getting the complete meaning behind each line here.\n\nIn the end, this game blew me away. I’d dare say this game made me actually fell in love with Muxin for the duration of the game, and several days after that, even right now as I type up this review. This game definitely separates itself from the genre and stands as one of the best, if not the best. I can’t wait to play more and see what’s to come, since I’ve heard there’s a total of 50 ways that the story could go, but I’m not sure if I want to experience the emotional trauma of preparing for Gaokao again. Plus, I love Muxin and Muxin only, so the storylines that doesn’t involve her…yeah.\n\nNow, because this game is so well made, I guess I’d like to recommend the game for you, whoever’s reading this.  The thing is, Muxin is mine and mine only, so don’t do it.\n\n\n\nPlease.","June 6, 2015","true","20.0"," 93 of 102 people (91%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","91","93","102","17","2"

I want the Badges!      DLC buy buy buy!\n\nSteam store：感谢您的购买！\nSteam store: Thank you for your shopping!\n\n作为一个去年买过实体游戏并参加过内测&英文校译之一的玩家肯定是要推荐这款游戏的。\n年初上班的时候得消息说要在steam上架，一个词，excited！\n\n去年刷微博的时候看到过有关高恋的消息，高中恋爱题材寻常见，加上高考前100天这题材还算新颖、结局是根据真实故事改编，就细看了介绍。但看到校服不禁在想，这不是要做中国特色galgame嘛，国内怎么可能有这种校服？但为原型校园的华中师范大学第一附属中学校服真的是这样。带着些好奇心于是便下了demo版开玩。\n\n进入游戏的时候也回忆了下国内高中生活，正如游戏里的男主一样，高中时遇到了很多人。大家各怀着内心的愿望，靠自己的力量前进。有时候相互依靠，有时候吵吵闹闹，和大家一样微笑、生气、哭泣。会考完后我就留学了，没有体验过高三没参加过高考，没有考前冲刺这种经历还是有点遗憾。\n\n简单的世界，并不存在于地球上的任何一处。无论身处何处，身负何种职业，都拥有同样的辛苦。这种辛苦并不是表现在同一方面，因为要贯彻的信念是不同的。“幸福的对立面往往都是不幸，幸福是伴随着沉重等等的代价的。”在一个galgame中结局没把到妹都算bad end，但狂战士路线（清华、211）算进bad end个人感觉比较牵强，除了恋爱还有很多事可以做，这算是对现实的妥协。\n\n主角前期的设定还是一如既往迟钝，性格犹豫不决，sometimes naive的普通高中生。后期根据所走的路线性格转变很大，如中二、丧心病狂、自暴自弃、新时代的好青年。\n\n看到黑长直的小涵眼前一亮，就这个人物关系的复杂程度及其深刻性而言塑造的很成功。表面上是风光无限女神学霸女强人，实际上却是家庭不幸又无奈的柔弱邻家女孩。就算自己把梦想描绘得多么美好，得到家人朋友社会的承认才是自己内心最渴望的事情。小涵真的是个非常能干女性，既美丽又体贴。我常常在想要是结婚的话一定要找个像小涵那样的妻子。最近她的美丽更是被雕琢的光彩照人，要形容那种的美的话就是一支摇曳的花朵，外表仿佛轻轻触碰便会飘散一般，但内心却有着凛然不屈的坚韧。更值得惊叹的是，与美貌相呼应的，她骄傲的灵魂也清澈美丽如同朝霞一样散发着迷人的光辉。这一定是奇迹吧！不，这不是奇迹，因为奇迹就是她本身的存在。现在我们看到的正是唤起奇迹的奇迹啊！\n\n游戏有50个结局，有些路线故事很短促，意犹未尽。而且其中一些结局未免相似，比如狂战士线结局都是得不到木馨的驻足分支只是分数高低而已。如果把几条线合并，写几条主线和分支线并合理安排情节可能会有意想不到的效果，使整部游戏几乎一直处在一个铺垫与冲突的环境中，紧紧围绕着对应支线的主题和线索，这比起大多数线路中共同而又几乎对主题起不到作用的日常来说，无疑高出了几个逼格。在一摸考试之后一些线路男主内心活动的剧本有待优化，无论一摸考的好坏，全部都是这次考的不好的想法。某次一模后明明都超过名校的分数线男主竟然还不满足【这次的成绩就是这样了。哎呀，成绩还可以呢。比想象中要好一点，真是万幸。】，嗯，这是要去考SAT, A-LEVEL的节奏。\n\nWhat's love? How far would you go for love? How much suffering can you take?\n\nIt’s a great story of our hero, a Chinese high school student struggling to make more effort enrolling in a good university and yet get the romance with his girlfriend he wants as well.\nSome of you guys are not Chinese may not understand why the hero’s so struggling at this moment, and that’s the Chinese special feature that students can’t be in love must keep single before they become freshmen in universities, cause it may affect theirs school performances, especially in this important time. I haven’t finished Chinese high school and then continue studying abroad in NZ high school and university, so I have no experience of studying for Gaokao with my friends in China, and playing this game help me remind of my old friends and my high school life in China.\n\nAfter playing it though, I can wholeheartedly agree that this is for me by far the best Chinese made galgame. The art style is excellent and characters look beautiful, especially their eyes, and the backgrounds were decently done. More often than not it was indecisiveness and lack of bravery or communication that prevented a better outcome. I can't call this a negative, as it was the source of drama and entertainment, but it certainly caused some internal frustration to me personally. It is a theme you guys may not relate to it at all, it seems like it would be easier to speak up rather than be so passive. That’s one of the Asian culture, expressing the emotions or feelings implicitly. Just make your choice and push the button “ADD TO CART”, and you will get a good experience of this game. The play translate in English can’t be like Queen’s English, some words and sentences, they don’t make sense, and maybe improve in the next version.","May 30, 2015","true","20.9"," 176 of 225 people (78%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","78","176","225","44","21"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eisenkoubu/recommended/347620/","eisenkoubu","EisenKoubu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eisenkoubu/","13 products in account","I was so hyped to play this VN. I've never played a Chinese VN before, so that alone was a new experience for me. But I think, like most other people who bought this game, I was most attracted to the idea of the game's sixty-one endings (that's including the ones the free DLC adds). After a couple of lucky coincidences, fate brought this game to my Steam library, and I am happy to be reviewing it today.\n\nSo what do I think about this game? Well, let's start at the beginning. I'm very much used to the typical style of visual novel where all you do is pick choices and watch the story unfold. But this is a game about passing a test! Of course you'll have to study for the stupid thing! So the developers added a Tokimeki Memorial-esque system where you can choose your activities for the day in-between other scripted events. These include studying, exercising, talking to friends, equipping items, and sleeping. I don't mind this system all that much, but the randomness adds a level of challenge that I feel at the time of this review may make certain endings almost unattainable without a great deal of luck. (For the record, I did not use the official guide during my first playthrough, although I think it may be necessary to reach some of the endings.)\n\nBut what's a dating sim without a story? Turns out the very first thing that happens is that you're tied to a girl named Muxin after 'accidentally' confessing to her. She happily accepts, but both her and the main character (whom I affectionately named Eisen) know that it will be difficult to maintain the relationship when GaoKao is closing in. Eisen unfortunately scored relatively low on the first mock test, and both Eisen and Muxin grew depressed. After breaking up, Eisen became a gaming addict, cutting himself off from the rest of humanity to find acceptance in another world. His friends and family desperately look for him, eventually finding him at a net cafe. Eisen receives the grave news that his mother is in the hospital, and he quickly breaks away from games to finish GaoKao. However, the damage has been done. Eisen not only lost his touch with the ladies, but he scored low on the GaoKao, just barely making it to a low-ranking university. Three months pass, and he finds out Muxin has scored love with someone else. There seems to be no happy ending for poor Eisen... ;_;\n\nAnd you know what makes that worse? I would have done almost the exact same thing in his shoes. Out of all the variety of canned situations presented in most visual novels, this one has the nerve to read out my future in Chinese academia as Episode 7 of Charlotte. (Obligatory Key reference, check. ;) ) And that's not a bad thing. :P\n\nWhile the ending I got at the time of this review hit me in the heartstrings, I think the journey there was just as enjoyable, especially concerning Muxin. She's an incredibly sweet character to be around, and seems tailor-made to be the ideal girlfriend. Most people come into this VN after already being dumped IRL at least once; I don't have such a medal of honor. What I can say is that it comes as crushing to see her move further and further apart from me, even after  all I did. It's a learning experience, in more ways than one. Whenever I do find myself dating in real life, hopefully I can take something away from this game.\n\nAnyway, on to the technical stuff. For a company that's only put out one VN so far, the art style looks very pretty. Every single character is well-drawn, the backgrounds are good, and the CGs are crisp and clear. The game utilizes the KiriKiri engine, a popular commercial engine used for such notable titles as Fate/Stay Night. Perhaps that has something to do with how professional-looking the game is. The UI is clean and user-friendly, the transitions between days and scenes are smooth, and it's capable of many different banner effects. After reading this and F/SN, I can see why people love using the engine so much.\n\nIn terms of sound quality, this is where the game starts to falter a bit. The music feels like the kind of music you would listen to while studying: slow, calm and inoffensive to the ears, but not catchy enough to be memorable. The music is by no means bad, but compared to higher-profile VNs (again, citing F/SN and its awesome soundtrack) it can't really work outside the context of the game. The voice acting isn't necessarily bad either; in fact, it fits the characters exceptionally well. I'm no expert on Chinese dialects or social etiquette, but the tone of delivery seems a little off in some situations. The characters seem like they're speaking in indoor voices throughout the entire game. This doesn't hurt the quality of the voice acting since there is a volume slider, but perhaps I'm a bit desensitized by the outlandish, hammy screaming Japanese VAs like to do. :P\n\nThen there's the script... *takes a deep breath to calm nerves*\n\nAlthough it's still readable, the translation is less than stellar. No offense to the translators, but the usage of English grammar or sentence structure comes off as a little awkward and imprecise. Granted, Chinese is a very difficult language to translate to English, because there are words and phrases that just don't translate well. But quite a few sentences in this game look like they were put into Google Translate and pasted on to the script to save time. I hate being critical, but the script is the most important part of a VN!  When a native English reader has to stop reading to think about what the people are actually saying, something's wrong. I'm sure it's something that could be patched, but as it is, the awkwardly-translated dialogue bothers me the most out of anything in this VN.\n\nSomething else I noticed about the script...a few terms exclusive to the Japanese language are used in the English script, when the characters say nothing of the sort. It's not exactly a problem I have with the script, but it speaks something to me about how much passion and respect for Japanese culture (even though it's a VN about Chinese culture) went into this VN...\n\nBeyond the smaller details, such as a clean, responsive backlog and autosave saving my life on a couple occasions, I don't have much else to say about this game. So, do I recommend this game? Yeah. Although the script is a somewhat garbled mess, it is still readable, and it offers a lot of insight into the social consequences surrounding the GaoKao exam, as well as an interesting, heartwarming subversion of the dating sim formula. It's worth checking out to see if your own future in Chinese academia will look bright without a walkthrough. :D","February 10","true","36.9"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

The large amount of endings you can get add to the replayability, and the story is realistic enough to be powerful and engaging. My first playthrough lasted me about 15-20 hours, and my attempts to get all other endings will take even more. There’s also achievements to unlock and cards to collect, if you’re into that kind of thing. I am, and the card art is really pretty. I recommend this to anyone who likes the Visual Novel genre or is interested in playing some VN’s for the first time. It’s a lot of casual stressful fun, and for $10, you cannot go wrong with that.","February 1","true","263.4"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","0"

There's just so much useless dialogue that doesn't really progress story...\n- Accurate simulation game. I completely failed at keeping the girl because I chose to study instead. Game successfully proves that Chinese brainwashing runs deep - even in a video game I chose education over love. It's happening all over again!!! ARGH!!!!\n\nThis is not my favourite VN, but it's not the worst either. The other big titles are all upwards of $20 so at the $10 price range, it's not half bad. It gets a passing "yes" simply because for its price, game length and content, it's decent/不错.\n\n做得好, 高考恋爱委员会.","June 2, 2015","true","3.5"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","76","22","29","15","0"

For Chinese students they know how Gaokao would be like, This is a good chance for people who have no experience with it to try. There are 50 endings in the game so it worth the players to try again. Although the main story line is about 3-4 hours for first time, the whole story will take more than 10 hours to complete. Many endings and story require players try different story line to find, especially for the "Play boy" and "Nice Boat" Ending. For Otakus really should try these endings :)\nSecondly, graphic is amazing. The pictures make people feel comfortable. They are good work and nice art style. I cannot find any problem with the graphic. Maybe the only problem is get MORE events and MORE pictures (Greedy is good)\nThirdly, game experience is excellent. Each time players try different choices the story will go to different endings, and more story content can be found. When players finish the ending all the items can be kept to next round.\nThere are some issues in game. But it is easy can see the hard work behind the game. The designers have tried their best to make it good within the resource limitation. They are a group of people who know how to make a good game. They should be encouraged.\n\n哪怕是作为国产游戏也是应该支持的，加油！","June 6, 2015","true","11.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","2"

It is definitely not something i would recommend for relaxing. I feel stress playing this for too long and I'm not studying!  I cannot imagine doing this in real life. I give Chinese students a lot of credit. As for story, I kind of wish the character was single to begin with as I am not a huge fan of Muxin (in terms of dating? lol).\n\nI don't speak Chinese, but I really like the voice actors. Muxin's voice is very cute, especially her nervous laugh. Though, I would prefer being with the neighbor! (Still trying to figure that out...)\n\nThe music is very nice...to be honest, one of the hours of gameplay is probably me snoozing. I played at 2AM one night and the music lulled me to sleep lol\n\nThe animation is very pretty, I really like their facial expressions, Muxin's in particular.\n\n\nEdit:\nAnd my file was corrupted. Not sure what happened there....now taking a much needed break from it. I'll pick it up again in the future.\n\nEdit again:\nIts been a while since I initially wrote this review, but I figure its worth saying I immediatly picked the game back up again despite the mishap. It was easy by fast forwarding, I do admit I made some changed in my decisons :B\nThis game was still very stressful for the reasons I said before. I chose my studies over everything unless Xiaohan was available. So because of this route, I do miss a lot of stories..I did however, get the ending I desired! In the future I will probably play again, not necessarily to date the other girls, but to see all the events I missed from studying my butt off. I still highly recommend this game!","November 9, 2015","true","12.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","10","13","2","0"

Then i found out how deep, meaningful, and emotional this game is. It most certainly became one of my favorite games of all time through everything it offers. What does it offer you ask? Well i'll tell you.\n\nPros:\n- Tons of replayability. Im pretty sure with the new dlc there is more than 60 endings now.\n- Stat managing. Adds a lot more interactivity than your average visual novel.\n- Meaningful and impactful story.  Even though i myself am not Chinese and haven't gone through    Gaokao, seeing how this single test affects the characters through the game made me understand    just how heavy a subject it is and should not be taken lightly. The game portrays this perfectly in my    opinion.\n- Art style. The art style is a great fit and appealing to the eyes.\n- The Feels - You will feel many emotions playing this. One moment you will feel happy, the next depressed, the next anger. If you are like me you may even shed some tears based on what happens through your playthrough.\n\nCons:\n- Translation issues at times. Believe me, the story is easy to read and you can understand most of it. There are just some points where the translation is a bit wonky. Though with the latest dlc patch the developers put in, it has helped this issue a lot.\n(That was my only con really)\n\nI dont like giving anything a number rating, so i will just say that this game is a MUST OWN for anyone who is a fan of visual novels and wants something unique. You will not regret it, especially at the low price of 9.99 usd when you may just spend more than 50 hours on the game getting all the endings. Highly Recommended!","November 20, 2015","true","20.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Considering GaoKao in game gives me a special impression, which reminds me to that unique period. Though in my opinion it has many advantages, the disadvantages cannot be ignored.\n1. there are so many ends  and  choices in this game, some of them are similar during the 100 days. I will feel boring if I complete the game with the similarily ends.\n2. some small actions can decrease the ablilities of study, the physical strength or the pressure , for example, just falling at home can reduce so many physical stregth.\nHowever there are still some parts that I adore. I think the CV of WeiTong which is really great, just like an idiot, can easily understand his nature from the voice. And the CGs are good. The figures that this game bulid are good, everyone has its own special characterisation. The music I think is the best part of this game. The story just like the thing I write perviously is normal considering so many similar choices, which makes me feel a little boring.\nIn summary, this game is worth to play. Hope you enjoy it.","March 26","true","7.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I never was a person who took initative... I would feel sorry for the one who dates me #foreveralone\n\nThe game is actually quite accurate in portraying what you choose, because I certainly didn't expect Xiaohan (childhood friend) to cockblock on me and Muxin in the cafe. The game is cleverly written, since I've seen most peoples' playthroughs are their blind-runs (not going for achievements), and relate to their lives in a sense.\n\nThere are a few grammar errors here and there, but you will understand what they mean. Just as long as bad translation doesn't bother you, you'll be fine.\n\nIt's Chinese voices, and I (for one) don't really like Chinese speakers... but this game makes me not feel negative toward hearing Mandarin anymore. Rather, more indifferent; the voice actors did a good job.\n\nIf you enjoy the music as much as I do, go get their $3.00 OST. Support them. Now that I actually have money, support the works you like. To access the .mp3 and .wav files, go to "Library" at the top of the Steam Client, and click "Music". Took me a while to find it; you won't find it in the Gaokao game.\n\nTL;DR: Good storywriting, good voice-acting (first Chinese-dubbed VN for me, and I hated hearing Mandarin), good OST.

I still ended up with a positive ending, the journey good have been a lot better.\nI had to look up a guide in order to get the ending I really wanted.\nWhile it's not a bad game, it's not exactly great either. The designs, settings, and music are great. The characters, especially the protagonist's parents, were not as great.

And at the same time, you're trying to balance a relationship that was probably destined to fail in the first place. You can focus completely on love or completely on work, or try to balance it out whichever way you feel will work best.

Where to begin...\n\nGaokao.Love.100Days is a visual novel detailing the experiences of the protagonist in the 100 days before the major college entrace exams in China. As the protagonist, you need to balance two key aspects of these 100 days -- your need to study for the exam, as well as the needs of your new girlfriend. Along the way, you'll dictate what sort of actions the protagonist takes, as well as how he reacts to certain situations.\n\nThe artwork is solid and professional, and is definitely up to par for a respectable visual novel. The characters are lively and well drawn. The background images are also detailed and rich, and the novel makes good use of transitions between locations and times.\n\nThe music, likewise, is fitting for a visual novel of professional standards. For approximately 75% of the novel, the same songs are used in most situations. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, though, because the songs are well composed and fit the situations they are played in. For important parts of the story, however, unique songs are used, and these musical pieces really add to the significance of these scenes.\n\nI can't speak to the voice acting, because I am not fluent, but the characters' voices were unique and non-annoying.\n\nThe characters themselves are interesting and possess a good amount of depth. There are three main characters in the novel (excluding the protagonist), and each of them has a unique personality and interaction. Stom's character is hilarious, and his exclamations really add a nice comedic effect to parts of the novel. Xiao is composed, intellectual, and contemplative, and her character also adds a measure of stability to the story. Ironically, I thought Muxin, the protagonist's girlfriend, had the weakest character construction of the three, although I think it's because of the choices I made in the game (more on that later).\n\nOne interesting part of the novel is the gameplay. Unlike other, more viewership-oriented visual novels, Gaokao.Love.100Days requires the player to guide the protagonist on day-to-day activities. You can decide whether to study, excercise, nap, talk to your girlfriend, etc. You are supposed to strive to balance your commitment to study with your need to interact with your girlfriend. In reality, I was confused from the start as to which direction to take. This novel is a classic case of "♥♥♥♥ on the player" mentality, in that random events can cause you to lose attributes or waste your time. Certain choices seem like a crap shoot at times; for example, you may choose to study one night, but because you "become pessimistic" your studying attempt backfires and your time is wasted. There isn't much predictability in these events, either, but I was never overly frustrated by this; remember, this is a visual novel after all, and I am along for the ride, so I'm not too frustrated when the game seems to make arbitrary decisions against me.\n\nThere is one part of the game that is seriously lacking -- the translations. To be blunt, the translations are a disaster. There are syntax errors throughout the novel, as well as misused pronouns and deconstructed sentences. There are also examples of poor word choice -- my favorite being one line, which a character says: "A person is dead if you kill them!" There are also some typos in the novel; for me, that above all else is inexcusable. Nonetheless, I am not the type of person to be annoyed by translation issues, so it didn't really affect my enjoyment of the game.\n\nFinally, the plot is... unique, to say the least. I initially felt as if there was no real choices being made in the game, and that the options the player has are merely there to provide the illusion of choice. Imagine my surprise when it was revealed that I got ending 51 (!!!). I was floored that there could be at least 50+ endings to the game.\n\nBy the end, I kind of realized that I had royally screwed up in the game, as I did not have a high score and (to put it mildly) I did not do well with my girlfriend. Part of that did frustrate me, because the game is not very specific on how to do well. Nonetheless, I am looking forward to my next playthrough to see what I could do better.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game because I appreciate the effort that went into it. I am surprised that it has such a high rating, considering my poor ending to the game; then again, maybe my failure was worse that I realize. Hopefully my second playthrough brings a more succulent plot than my first.","February 27","true","18.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

These expectations were not met for me.\n\nWhile I like the concept of balancing a relationship and test grades/scores in a simulator type way, but the execution of this was not fun, especially when the game seemingly worked against me by auto lowing my stats every other in-game evening through random events that had nothing to do with the decisions I had made up to that point, or to things that made no sense. (Previous Year's Champion's Motivational Speech tripled my stress huh?)\n\nI understand that Visual Novels are pretty much entirely "on-rails" in terms of story, you can at least nudge them in different directions to change the plot. This holds true with Gaokao Love as well, but I felt extremely restricted here, even for the ten different routes the game promises. While the story's direction did indeed change, it all felt hollow as our character (and with him the story) constantly focuses on the same person (Muxin) regardless of character route chosen, each ending I have experienced made mention of her when she did not matter at that point.\n\nBecause of the story's focus not shifting to prioritize other characters, they felt wasted as they were never the focus for long. While each personality is well established off the bat, I never felt like they were properly fleshed-out. If you (like me) are looking for a feels-heavy Visual Novel, this isn't the place.\n\nI got bored close to the end of each run, as each day's conversations held the same topics but with different wording...\n\nI'll be honest I have not gone though each route, but the four I have gone through has not left me with any desire to try the others...","April 3","false","15.7"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

I got a sad ending at the first time. However, I could get what the story tells. I've earned more 20 enddings now. The endings are a lot. Some are really interesting.\n\nI'm also playing this game and hope my Chinese will be improved. I'm glad to hear that the Eng Ver. will be improved, but I'm afraid that the points of some Chinese jokes will not be got easily. I cannot wait to play the new version.\n\nThough I don't think it is that much difficult to find a girlfriend in China, I've heard some Chinese friends discussing about the difficulties to get a boyfriend/girlfriend. I think, the girls or boys who set high standards for boyfriend/girlfriend are seeking for a potential better half before starting a relationship rather than trying to find a boyfriend/girlfriend to build a relationship with. Their ways are nothing wrong, but they cannot represent all Chinese, right?\n\nAnyway, in this game, I've learned "love" is love in Chinese culture. Of course, love has various shapes in different culture backgrounds and love is also shown in a specific way by every individual. Like Muxin and Xiaohan, or other characters in the story, they own their vision of love and life, which makes the diversity of endings. : )\n\nThose are my points. Chinese gamers who want to share your opinions with me are welcome. Sorry, my Chinese is not good enough to write understandable comments.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hipsta/recommended/347620/","hipsta","Hipsta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hipsta/","878 products in account","It's hard writing this review. Really, not going to lie. This visual novel is bad and good at the same time, but let me explain myself. (kind of TL; DR tho, so just skip to the last paragraph for conclusion, if you don't want to waste too much of your time) (please, do note, that this is the first experience and is written after only one hour of playing the game).\n\nSo, Gaokao.Love.100Days is a story of... you, being a senior student, preparing for the graduation test and getting a girlfriend at the same time.Sounds pretty basic, eh? Well, not really. Thing that got me saying "oh, come on!" was the fact that you are tied to the story too much. By that I mean that you can't really influence it in the beggining (even from the start you are told that you already have a girlfriend and you can't change). Maybe that's a personal thing, but in my humble opinion. it's needless and forcing a story to be told in a very narrow way, which is great for books and films, but not for video games (epecially for a vn). The choice (note: NOT including choice of "what to do" during weekends and night classes) is also quite rare in the first hour, and even when you get to it, it doesn't really change anything. It's just there to end the scene and that's it. Point here is, the story is narrow.\n\nMoving on it's fair to admit that characters are descent, but dialogues (at lest most of them) are silly and pointless (e.g., first 30 minutes of the game, characters are trying to talk about cakes for almost 2 bloody minutes, and it's happening in the first 2 days, too). I can understan people may enjoy it, but come on - cakes? For two minutes? And digging deeper, trying to "explain" a character (but, as we all aware, that's not how it works). That's the second point: characters feel weak and kinda cliche (but still attractive as characters, at least some of them).\nAlso, do I really have to mention that your alter ego in the game doesn't have any character at all?\n\nThirdly, (this is rather personal) characters have voices (not all of them tho, only the key characters do). This is a common problem of vn on Steam. Voices spoil the mood, because it's not anime, it's, first of all, a novel, and novel is meant to be read. In this case, tho, I'd say that only Muxin's voice is annoying, The rest of the cast is descent, but they could've been way better without any talking at all.\n\nNow, to points why I still recommend this game. The atmosphere of Spring and coming-up important exams is delivered well (in some cases even amazingly), the backgrounds are great and character's drawing is good (still better than Always Remember Me), the soundtrack is beautiful and pretty much makes half of the atmosphere. The story is silly, stupid sometimes, but rather descently written. At least it feels like I'm seeing people on the screen, not dolls (yes, Sakura series, I'm talking about you) and life simulation is descent (even though I can't help but rage why you have to pick JUST ONE option for the whole day, while in Always Remmeber Me, for example, it took some time to do that and it took some time to do this, not just IT TAKES A WHOLE DAY/NIGHT CLASS TO CALL MUXIN)\n\nOkay. So, summing up.\nGaokao is certainly not the worst visual novel out there, and in the end of the day, I don't regret spending my money on it. However, it lacks what most visual novels have: an interesting setting of the story and actually interesting original characters (I have no idea how there are 50+ endings, really). Maybe I don't get it becaus I'm still yet to finish Senior year, or maybe I just don't want to replay similar-to-real situations. Dunno, but what I'm trying to say is that other novels try to put you in a different situation that you are higly unlikely to experience (such as school for disabled people in Katawa Shoujo, for that instance). Here, it's just life of a senior student. That's it (even though some endings, as I heard, are quite depressing and interesting, but I'm yet to discover that)\n"But Hipsta", I can hear you saying, "You barely played 1 hour, that's not how it works". True that, but if I'm not interested in reading during the first hour, during my first impression, what's the point of moving on with it?\nAs a final score, I'll give it a 6-7-7.5/10. As to "why I should buy it?", I'd say buy it if you want to go through a light, easy-to-read novel telling a story of a simple guy with an ordinary life. For others, I'd say read If My Heart Had Wings or Fruit of Grisaia.\n\nP.S. The opinion may change since it's the impression of just the very first hour of the game, so you might as well stay tuned.","July 17, 2015","true","0.8"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","13","26","0","2"

The plot is interesting enough though. If the stress of important exams in real life isn't enough you can simulate the experience of what it's like to have to study or face the reality of making iPods for minimum wage for the rest of your life. It's an exciting experience for certain.\n\nMost of it's broken English, but don't worry, it's pretty easy to understand anyway.\n\nThis game also has over 50 different labor camps you can be sent to-I mean endings. Just to show how much effort was put in. It truly is marvelous in that it is quite a lot of the content for the price it asks.\n\nUnfortunately I couldn't bear with the broken English long enough to make it more than twelve minutes or so.\n\nYour mileage may vary but I either recommend you be able to speak Chinese or have a high tolerance for broken English if you want to give this game a try. I'm still recommending it because it's not a bad game, in fact it's quite good, but my grammar Nazism stopped me from getting through the entire experience.","March 4","true","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Scooterino/recommended/347620/","Scooterino","Anime Girls 4 Trump","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Scooterino/","29 products in account","I love Visual novels, but I do not love Gaokao. I'm barely 30 days into my adventure and I have to stop here. From a developer's standpoint the game's mechanics are interesting and fun, the problem is the creators stretched themselves too far in trying to make it too unique, which leaves both the VN gameplay, and the RPG-esque gameplay very underwhelming.\n\nThe story thus far. I've known this girl two weeks and she's telling me her tragic backstory. I honestly don't care. I am not attached to her, and do not even care about her past. Nothing has happened to make me feel attachment to this character, and thusly, I don't care for her fear of the dark, her fear of animals, and her fear of failing class.\nOn the other hand, the fact that there are only 3 "main" characters (aside from yourself) leaves a whole lot to be desired. Only two main girls and the plucky sidekick that tries too hard to be memorable become very stale and annoying after a week of play-time. I don't care for Stom, I don't care for Muxin, and the only interesting character to me is Xiaohan. She's the only one who doesn't have silly quirks like being a foodie, or being overhyped about EVERYTHING. But then you learn "oh yeah, i remember, her grandma died and her parents leave her alone to live in her dead grandmother's apartment." once again, backstory i did not care for. Story writing thus far has been extremely lazy, and disappointing. Granted, i can forgive translation errors, but there is too much conflict being forced, too much backstory being driven down your throat, and too much Stom. Seriously, he's annoying and unfunny at all times.\nStory and Characters:2/10\n\nThe RPG side of the game is super cool, and if I didn't have to worry about balancing a failing relationship on top of it, I would have a lot more fun. What strategies can I do to make my studying better? What items can I use to get more points in English? How can I avoid being sick? All of these and more alone make it an interesting game. The only problem is I have to balance a forced storyline, and attempt to console a weeping Muxin instead of study study study like I want to. Sure, I have the option to not do that, but in few instances I was FORCED to be with Muxin, and although it is an option I likely would have taken, railroading should NEVER occur in a Visual Novel. That said, forcing me to get sick because instead of sleeping, I ran around with Muxin is extremely unfun.\nMechanics: 4/10\n\nSounds. Now the BGM is fantastic. I'm a sucker for background music. I listen to the OST of Angel Beats, Mushi-shi, and Katawa Shoujo all the time. Gaokao has a very nice soundtrack that fit with the scenery, and the voices not only fit their characters, but also sound really good. My issue with the voices are the fact that only the main characters have voices. You don't hear your own father and mother speak to you.\nBut sound effects... oh boy... I will never get this out of my head. MREOW. Oh hey, a cat. MREOW. they just used the same sound effect twice in a row what the actual hell. *30 seconds later* MREOW okay this is lazy at this point. They can't use google to get more than one meow sound effect? If I were to hand in an assigment that used the same sound effect four times in a single sequence I would fail the project, and the class. This was unbelievably lazy, and the developers should be ashamed that they let this happen.\nBGM: 9/10\nSFX: 0/10\n\nThe art of the game is very pretty, but because of the lack of characters I expected there to be more. There aren't many background images, and transitionary scenes are always so plain and unimpressive. I was also upset to see character sprites outside of school, but still in their school uniforms. OR RUNNING ON A TRACK, AND STILL IN THEIR BUTTON UP SHIRTS. Nobody works out in their school uniforms. Lazy artwork. The lack of a lot of additional sprites got me down about this game, but the backgrounds are still beautiful. Alongside that, the special scenes such as Muxin sitting on a bench petting a cat is also very well done, but there is still so much to be desired.\nArt: 5/10\n\nOverall, I would give this game a 3/10. Not a second passing glance, probably won't play through a second storyline, and considering how open ended the game is (50-something endings) I do not think THAT much replay value is needed or even worth it. I know of all the options, but trying too hard to take them will be too much of a hassle, and I'll end up getting an ending I didn't want. If i want to cheat on Muxin I have to talk to Xiaohan every waking moment, but then I'll lose points in tests and probably get stressed. If I want to dump Muxin and focus on tests, I might be forced to get sick again, and lose 20 points in every single stat. Those risks do not justify what I want to do, and make this game virtually unplayable.\nIn my opinion, the developers should have developed the RPG side better, and playtested it to no end to balance it, but instead we are left with a jumbled mess of 50+ endings, not-very-interesting characters, a broken studying system, and an overall pretty bad game. I am not looking forward to finishing it.","July 24, 2015","false","7.7"," 21 of 46 people (46%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","46","21","46","10","0"

It started good but it went horrible so fast and it just made me so mad.\n\nIn the beginning I had lots of choice constantly as I could increase my skills, talk to the girl I liked and do whatever. But all the sudden I could do nothing, my skills deterioated agianst my will, the girl was gone everything and anything went down the drain. It wasn't till the last 25 days I had any choice back and by then any attempt to do anything was undone the next frickin day!\n\nThis had so much potential and it felt like it was new and fresh for me in dating sim genre with options other than the girls. But no.\n\nTo make matters worse I was extremely uncomfortable after the first fourth of the game as the parents became physically as well as emotionally abusive and manipulative. The chratcer that I thought I was doing a good job by keeping the stress low and doing my best in my studies became an absolute scumbag in the way he talked.","April 30","false","14.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Otherwise like me, you may find it rather dull. Conversations seem fragmented and run on way too long; and this is made more tedious by having to click to advance through them as one does in these kinds of games. Likewise are the transition cutscenes which--while nice looking--add nothing to the story and feel like filler. I would grade this game a C. But with better writing/editing and maybe a little design polishing Gaoko.Love.100Days could be a grade B game.\n\nA much better example of this kind of game is Sunrider Academy, which I recommend (please read my review for info).","October 4, 2015","false","0.7"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","3","16","0","0"

Obviously the creators ran out of imagination after using up those out-of-date classic fragments.\nThe dubbing is rubbish. Especially the glass girl, I can't believe a team would actually hire such a newbie that anyone can tell that she has no experience of dubbing after hearing the first line of hers. Their performance can't be called acting.\nIn the early versions of this game lots of pictures in it are not produced by the creator team but from the Internet. It's seems that they deleted them later.\nThe musics are old-styled, nothing new.\nThe translation is... well, as the original Chinese version's style of writing is childish and wierd, the translation is not to be blamed.\n\nI don't know if there will actually be someone out of China interestedi in this game, in case there be, I strongly advise you not to buy it.\n\nYou wanna play a dating game?
