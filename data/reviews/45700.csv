The first being that for just over half the game you play as the new protaganist Nero who is incredibly watered down in comparison to Dante, having only a single sword and gun, no styles and being easier to perform certain actions. Something unique to Nero is his demon hand, the Devil Buster, which allows him to grab enemies towards him or grab himself towards them, as well as a few special moves. Overall while not terrible he's a lot less fun to play as than Dante.\n\nDante suffers from playing second fiddle to Nero over all, when you do get to play him you are just cutting your way back through the levels you went through as Nero and fighting the same bosses, only backwards. Including the default weapons, Dante also only has access to three Devil Arms and Guns each, about half of the previous game's weapon selection.\n\nThe story is meh. Nothing special, nothing terrible. Doesn't ruin the game and I think if you're playing a DMC game for Shakespear you're playing it for the wrong reasons. I don't really have much more to say on that.\n\nProbably missed out on some things, migh edit this later. Overall good, and as I said   in the opening it's the best DMC game available for PC, it just has some rather large pitfalls that stop it from being the best DMC full stop.","September 11, 2013","true","25.7"," 67 of 73 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","67","73","0","0"

Everything your character can do can link to 90% of everything else he can do. High difficutly abounds as both you and the enemy are empowered to ludicrous extents as you improve your moveset in turn with the difficulty. The only realy downfall I can say is that it nearly requires you to have a gamepad.\nThe engine itself is so well optimized it borders on black magic. Seriously. This game has run on Windows XP computers that came out before the 360.\nThe story is nothing to truly write home about, but it has a hell of a lot more tact than "♥♥♥♥ you!" and "I'm your prom date you ugly sack of ♥♥♥♥!"\nAt the end of the day, if you have to buy any one brawler or character action game on Steam, I highly, highly recommend it be this one. It has an exclusive difficulty mode for the PC since no other system could HANDLE it.\nThe only issues you might have with the game are the lack of quick time events (♥♥♥♥ you if so, the game requires skills that aren't simon says related), the fact that the game demands very, very real skill from beginning to end, especially if you want the best rank for each mission, and finally, the fact that the second half of the story is playing through the same levels against the same bosses as a different character with an entirely different sense of playstyle. If that isn't your thing (different characters halfway through), you probably shouldn't be in this genre to begin with, but there you go.\nThis game is more or less the Redline of brawlers. It burns you out on quality so hard going to anything else just feels WRONG.","October 19, 2013","true","54.6"," 58 of 67 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","58","67","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SuperGenericUrl/recommended/45700/","SuperGenericUrl","Torna","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SuperGenericUrl/","52 products in account","Devil May Cry 4 is an amazing hack-and-slash game that is easy to learn and hard to master. The combat system is very in depth and there is always more room for improvement, even for the greatest masters of the game. It also has many different difficulty levels that will keep you busy for HOURS. You get to play as either Nero, who has a very interesting combat system because of his grab ability, and Dante, who has a variety of weapons and fighting styles to choose from while in game, giving an indefinite number of possibilities for combos. Plus, the game is very pretty, even on the lowest graphics settings, and for a PC port, it is not that bad.\n\nNow here's the part where you yell at me for stating my opinion. My main criticisms of the game lie heavily in the story, which I honestly believe was bland and tasteless. Dante isn't the main character, but instead, it's Nero, who in my opinion, acted too much like a whiny ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (though his combat is very unique). A majority of the characters are completely one-dimensional and don't really serve any purpose other than being the damsel in distress or the power-hungry bad guy or the envious rival . I pretty much only enjoyed the parts of the story where Dante was included because at least he was cheeky in an enjoyable way. Although I liked Nero's combat style, it got old for me pretty quick.\n\nOther downsides include the camera problems (which I am pretty sure is typical for a Devil May Cry game), a lack of costumes, the hideous amount of backtracking which puts Dante's role in the game to shame (I am talking you're backtracking for almost HALF THE GAME), and the lame final boss whose attack patterns are very predictable. Plus there's not much innovation put into the level design, which brings me back to the backtracking issue. I honestly felt like I was playing a somewhat incomplete story.\n\nOverall DMC4 was a mostly fun ride from start to end. It does bring back Bloody Palace as well as has a couple fun bosses. What it fails at in areas such as level design and completeness, the game makes up for it with an awesome combat system, beautiful visuals, and long playability.\n\nOverall I give Dante May Backtrack 4 a 7/10\n\nTL;DR It's fun to play but it's half of a good game.","October 29, 2014","true","131.5"," 47 of 51 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","47","51","0","0"

If you were considering this, I suggest you wait a few months.\n\nDevil May Cry 4 is intended for a controller, playable with a keyboard (on the highest difficulties and for doing advanced combos)- but bizarre as the mouse is only for menus. In a lot of cases the game will require the player to press 3+ keys at the same time without ghosting (common in cheap keyboards made only for typing).\nThe game still refers to a left analog stick when listing the inputs for a command, which corresponds to some action with WASD- there is no walk modifier key, and the interact [contextual] button will remain even when the command it's tied to has been rebound.\n\nThe game also forces the player to play as specific characters for certain missions, while leaving some boss fights unavailable (i.e Sanctus vs Dante; The Savior vs Nero) or far less accessible (i.e Credo vs Dante after 79 waves in Bloody Palace compared to Nero who only needs to reach the end of a mission).\nThis could also affect the general learning curve and game progression (e.g unlocks, next difficulty) if the characters are played for imbalanced amounts of time and/or the player finds a preference of which character to play.\n\nIn content, it's typical for a Devil May Cry game to have some backtracking or content recycling; in this iteration, it's done quite unimaginatively in having the backtracking mission's traversal mostly be the backwards of the initial path. Another is using the same generic battle theme per character for the non-boss encounters (few exceptions).\n\nThe game excels in combat and the nuances & quirks in building combos- e.g Jump Canceling, Guard Flying, Guard Cancel, Invulnerable Frames on certain actions; though at points there'll be a disconnection between what the game considers 'stylish' and what is actually technically impressive ('stylish' to other people).\n\nIf you find yourself having little intention to replay or practice playing the game long enough to accomplish the more technical feats, this game, like most, may not be as satisfying as doing so.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO7fAe-Cyvc","November 28, 2013","true","737.1"," 46 of 50 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","46","50","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/latmin/recommended/45700/","latmin","Lat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/latmin/","557 products in account",""Time to wake up kid, you're missing out on all the fun."\nDevil May Cry 4 is a very tragic case-study of rushed development. The dev team were only given a year to finish the game, forcing them to cut out tons of planned content, rewrite a lot of story and re-use most of the levels, to save time. Thinking about it just breaks my heart completely, because I can't help but think - if a rushed, watered-down and cut version of DMC4 still manages to be this good, then just how much more incredible could it have been?\n\nMake no mistake about it - Devil May Cry 4 is a ridiculously good game, and a credit to its genre. It is fast, exciting and challenging to play, with a skill ceiling for years; it's gorgeous to look at, and buttery-smooth in motion; and it has an engaging story with good characters, whose themes are reflected in how they play. Even in the face of its rushed development, and problems that start seeping through as you play, it still manages to be one of the finest Hack 'n' Slash-Spectacle Fighters around, paled only in comparison to Devil May Cry 3.\n\nThe combat in DMC4 is almost a form of art in itself. There is a ton of depth and nuance in the combat and the game invites you to experiment with it, and discover how best to tackle its many challenges. Experimenting, applying a variety of different moves and combos, and generally performing well during combat earns you higher style rankings, that rewards you for not only defeating your enemies, but lookin' good while doing it. It's like a Tony Hawk game, but with fighting. The controls are responsive as can be and the enemies seem well balanced for the most part, making enemy encounters often challenging, but never unfair. The levels are mostly well-designed, though as with the other titles in the series - the platforming sections can be a real pain, when the game doesn't seem to want to cooperate with you. There is also Turbo Mode, which makes the game play at break-neck speeds.\n\nYou get two characters to play with, each of whom has a distinct design philosophy built around their moveset. Nero is designed around his grab ability, for quickly shortening the distance between him and enemies, among other things. This makes him very accessible to play as a newcomer, yet fun to learn for a veteran. Eventually you get to the missions with Dante, and this is where the combat really opens up. He is designed around switching on-the-spot between various combat styles and an arsenal of different weapons, which can be switched instantly, and strung together during combos. This provides seemingly endless possibilities in experimentation. It is honestly overwhelming to try and visualize the different possible combos a skilled player could string together, using all these tools. Playing as both characters, you will end up facing a lot of the same obstacles, which provides you with the chance to approach fighting different enemies using different styles of play. This especially comes through in boss fights, which do feel quite different, depending on which character you're fighting as.\n\nIt's towards the end of the game that the cut-content and rushed nature of DMC4's gameplay shines through, though. I didn't mind backtracking through the same levels as Dante, since his movelist feels so different and more open than Nero's, but I couldn't help but feel that there was just not enough Dante in the game. By the time you've grown accustomed to his style of play, and feel like you're ready to really let loose with his moves, you're put back in Nero's shoes, for the endgame. And you really do miss Dante's weapons and styles, once you lose them. There's also no denying that the last few boss fights are underwhelming, to say the least. Dante's final boss is the worst boss in the entire game, followed by Nero taking on a recycling of a previous boss fight, which is then followed by, what amounts to, little more than a short QTE fight. The endgame of the campaign certainly leaves a lot to be desired, though a lot of the levels are very replayable, and you do unlock Bloody Palace (survival mode), which is an all-around good time. And at least the story ends on a high note. Speaking of which...\n\nTaking cues from the previous entry in the series, DMC4 brings an engaging character-driven story to tie all the fighting together. It continues the themes of human vs. demon, or heart vs. power, and is driven by a sentimental, if rather cheesy, emotional core of love. The characters (mainly Nero and Dante) and the ways they play off each other, both directly and thematically (especially if you're just coming off of DMC3), are a real treat, and the game has no shortage of great banter and dialogue from Dante (though Nero does bring some enjoyable snark and attitude to his cutscenes, as well). It is, by no means, on par with DMC3 or its clashing main characters, but it does provide enough incentive to keep you going to see what happens next.\n\nOn every technical front, DMC4 performs brilliantly, as well. It is a gorgeous looking game, and is so-well optimized that it runs like a dream, even on low-end hardware. A controller is certainly recommended, but honestly I personally didn't have all that much trouble getting a grip on the keyboard controls, so it's not a necessity.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a fast, challenging, over-the-top game that pits you against overwhelming odds, and challenges you to beat them in the most stylish way possible, then DMC4 is an excellent choice, whether you're a newcomer to the series, or a veteran in being the one to fill dark souls with light. At this point in time, you'd probably be better off getting the Special Edition, as it seems Capcom has no intention of cutting the price on this release, or ever putting it on sale again, but I can't attest to the quality Special Edition personally, so buy it at your own discretion.","December 28, 2015","true","20.7"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","29","33","2","0"

Get the HD Collection for your console, DMC3 on Steam is not a good port.\nThis game is much like its predecessors, non-stop cuhrayzee action with swords, guns and badass-looking combos.\nYou start off the game as Nero, a novice in the demon hunting arts compared to Dante, so you can get comfortable with some more basic stuff. Halfway through the game though you switch to Dante, and as opposed to DMC3 you can now switch between all of his styles AT WILL, ON THE FLY. It really shows the difference between a novice and a professional, and I think Dante is my favorite character because of the fact that you can do so much ♥♥♥♥ with him.\n\nEven if you complete the game once, the fun doesn't stop there, as Bloody Palace returns, but one caveat for me is the fact that it's on a timer, whereas the DMC3 one wasn't. Even if you don't dig Bloody Palace, you can still replay the game on Dante Must Die, Heaven or Hell and Dark Knight Mode, which I wholeheartedly recommend.\n\nReally, if you just like chaining together huge combos, taunting your enemies and looking like a badass while doing it, definitely consider purchasing this game.","December 28, 2013","true","27.0"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","28","32","0","3"

I'll probably be updating this review the more i play this game, but this is my opinion so far.\n\nThis game donesn't have the awesome atmosphere, enviroments and music that DMC3 had, but it's still and awesome game. The graphics are great! They still hold up 6 years after its release. The voice acting is also pretty good and the story is okay. But you don't play a DMC game for that story ♥♥♥♥. You play it for the combat! The fighting mechanics have been revamped since DMC3. Now Dante can switch fighting styles on the go and can hold 3 guns, and melee weapons at the same time which makes for much more possibilities. They've also added a new character named Nero who is actually the main character of the game. Even though he's not as complex as Dante, he's still got a far bit of depth to his combos and relies more on timing with his EX gauge. Nero is also more accesable to new players of the series. His combos are more simple in comparison to Dante, but he still plays great. There were also some new features added to the PC version of this game, the best of these being the new difficulty, Legendary Dark Knight mode. Legendary Dark Knight mode is a great addition to the game and it's pretty addictive as well. This game will also run on a low end PC just fine , there is also alot of replay value here and if you love the DMC series, you'll find yourself sinking plenty of hours into this game.\n\nNow here comes the bad. My problems with the game would be that it doesn't feel as finished or polished as DMC3, and that's because it's not. The enviroments are kind of copy and paste (Except for the Jungle) and the music is mediocre at best. It is also alot more repetative than the previous games (I don't know about 2 because i've never played it). You fight the 4 same bosses at least 3 times in 1 playthrough and the chess sections are just so dumb. But that doesn't mean the game is bad. Overall it has great graphics, cool cutscenes and the best combat system in any game i've played. If you can get over it's minor flaws, you will have a blast experimenting with new and different combos and enjoying yourself in one of the best action games of all time.","October 16, 2014","true","61.0"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","25","30","0","0"

Combo videos and tournaments show how far the gameplay has evolved.\n-Cheesy Dialogue\nThis game has cheesy one liners and story, some of it is unintentionally bad, but most of it is intentional, mostly when it comes to Dante.\n-Efficient Port.\nSeriously, this game can run on a toaster powered by Homer Simpson's brain. I ran this on an i5 with integrated graphics (HD4000) and it ran anywhere between 50-90fps at medium settings at 720p. With my new laptop, I can run it at 120fps (the game is capped at that framerate) at 1080p with everything maxed out. However, recording gameplay is strangely demanding/inconsistent. I recommend you use something like Bandicam (with Motion JPEG or another, more efficient codec) or Dxtory to record, though I assume most of you have PCs powerful enough to not notice a thing.\n-Graphics\nSure, compared to games of today, the graphics are below average, but for its age it holds up well. Especially if you consider it ran at an average of 60fps on consoles, and should be better looking when DMC4SE comes out. A minor point as this game's strengh comes in gameplay, but still worth pointing out.\n\nCons\n-Backtracking\nIts horrible, about half of the game consists of backtracking. Granted, some areas have been changed significantly, and virtually all enemy waves are altered, but the same levels appear multiple times.\n-Nero as a Main Character\nA lot of the backlash of this game was the replacement of the series' main protagonist, Dante, with a younger character called Nero. He takes more than half of the game for himself, so might even argue most of the game since Dante backtracks Nero's missions. This is more of a con to longtime fans of the series. He's an amature and cries a lot for my liking. His gameplay is also more shallow in comparison to Dante's, but to Nero's credit, still has enough for veterans to experiment with (seriously, I play Dante much more than Nero, but I can still appreciate the skill and creativity players display with him).\n-Unfair Enemies\nDMC4 has the best gameplay I've ever seen in the genre, but paradoxically lacks good enemies. Dont get me wrong, a good fraction of the depth should be attributed to the enemies and how their physics and AI work. But if there's one thing I hate, its unfair attack cues. Certain enemies have attacks that are downright cheap. The time between the attack animation starts to when the attack hits (the player) can last less than a second, which can be avoidable if you were doing nothing else but standing, but in a game like this, odds are that you were in the middle of an attack, in a room filled with enemies. Certain enemies like Chimeran Assualts and Chimeran Scarecrows attack the player even if they're stunned, with almost random attack patterns with no attack cues. You basically have to play it safe and use quick long ranged attacks that contribute to bordom. Unfortunately, around half of the enemies have at least one cheap attack, which is sad considering there wouldn't be any problem if it wasn't for that 1 or so attack.\n-Story\nThe series never had a strengh in story, gameplay and style always came first. This may or may not be a good thing for you. For me it certainly didn't matter, but there are some newcomers that believe every game should be a hollywood movie. The game is arguably a downgrade in story quality, when compared to DMC3.\n\n\nTL;DR:\nIf you're into stylish gameplay that will keep your attention for years, I highly recommend this game.\n\nIf you intend to play this game only once, it can be hard for me to recommend you this game. Especially if you're into the CINEMATIK XPERIENZ","June 15, 2015","true","857.0"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","19","20","3","3"

You'll see what I mean.)\nThe graphics are downright stunning, and are optimized enough to run well on a craptop.\nI'm serious. I haven't seen optimization this good since Half-Life 2.\n\nDon't like Nero? Ok. You get Dante in ten missions. He plays even more smoothly than he did in DMC3. His combos, as an effect, are now so varied it's borderline ridiculous, and they don't feel even remotely choppy.\n\nNot enough enemies? No problem. Play on Legendary Dark Knight difficulty. You'll have so many enemies that your style meter won't know what to do.\n\nToo slow for you? They've also got that covered. Turbo is in the PC version. Play Devil May Cry at 120% the speed it was before. That's damn fast.\n\nDon't like the bosses? Who cares? You get Bloody Palace once you beat the game (on not Easy). You don't even have to play as Nero in it. You can start as Dante and show off your combo-crazy prowess on wave after wave of unfortunate foes.\n\nDon't like Dante? Go see a doctor.\n\n9.3/10\nThe only thing wrong with this game is the repitition of bosses (even moreso than the first DMC) and the terrible way the dice game was implemented on Dante Must Die difficulty.\nBut to be honest, I've had more fun with the bosses here than I had with every other DMC.","October 9, 2014","true","38.0"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","27","35","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/recommended/45700/","doomsdayforte","DF","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/","936 products in account","I paid $5 for Devil May Cry 4 and it took around 13 hours to finish on Devil Hunter mode.  I used an Xbox 360 controller the entire time.  I wouldn't say I did great, but I still got to the end with some frustration.  I'd say I highly recommend this one.\n\nI've never played a DMC game before.  The closest I got was X-Blades and that...wasn't really a good representative of the spectacle fighter genre or whatever it's called.  This review is probably better aimed at people new to the series like I was.\n\nThe game is a third-person action title.  Apart from solving some simple puzzles, DMC4 largely revolves around fighting groups of mooks and large bosses, often in a “room locks, kill everything to proceed” format.  Nero's gameplay involves using a mix of his gun and sword for regular combat, but he has a unique feature in his Devil Bringer arm for heavy but slow attacks or for bringing an enemy/yourself closer or to evade some attacks.  Dante's gameplay involves on-the-fly swapping between his four stances along with changing his ranged and melee weapons.  Nero's playstyle felt easy to use for a newcomer like me, and Dante felt pretty advanced though I still did fine without really using his full potential.\n\nDMC4 is the kind of game that rewards you for learning its systems and playing well.  You're graded at the end of each mission on time taken, Style points, the percentage of Red Orbs found, and any modifying bonuses or penalties like using no items or dying and continuing.  Higher ratings give more Proud Souls which are spent to unlock new abilities or weapon combos or the like.  You can also refund spent Proud Souls to tweak or completely remake your build between missions or at the Divinity Statues scattered through the environment.  Time taken is self-explanatory, and Red Orbs are found in the world and are dropped by enemies, and these are spent at Divinity Statues for consumable recovery items or permanent boosts with no refund option.\n\nAs for Style points, one of the series' features is its high risk Style system.  By avoiding damage and attacking enemies with strings of combos, your Style meter will raise and increase in rank.  Getting hit will knock you down a couple of ranks, and using your guns to play it safe won't impress anyone.  It's a largely optional feature, but apart from the rewards mentioned above, it does feel awesome to work up to a high rank and keep it going.\n\nThere are a total of seven difficulty levels though you start with two.  For what I played being “normal” level, it was still pretty tough, though I imagine it'd be a cakewalk for veterans.  Apart from the unlockable standard hard and very hard, there are a couple of different ones where both you and the enemies die in a single hit, where only you die in a single hit and the enemies don't, or one where enemies spawn in fairly large packs as shown in some of the screenshots on the Steam Store page.  There are other things to unlock on the collectibles side, like the Gallery entries or in-game achievements, and there are Secret Missions hidden away with bonuses for those who can complete them.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed DMC4 despite some annoyances like having to fight the camera a couple of times, or bosses that were a chore to kill.  I probably won't pick it up again anytime soon, but I left the game on a high note at least.  The game ran incredibly well on my rig in DirectX10 mode and I think I only saw less than 60 frames maybe once the entire run.  There's a lot of replay value if you like the idea of harder challenges or just want to get a better score.  This version of the game tends to be cheaper than the Special Edition, though that obviously has more content and features in its favor.\n","September 12, 2015","true","15.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","0"

This here is simply there to state my opinion on the game. So lets begin:\n\nSo after buying the DMC 3 and 4 recently i was hoping to play them very soon. I have watched many videos about the series and loved it already. Then finally it said: DMC 3 was finished downloading. DMC 4 was next but i already started to play the first one i had to play.\n\nAnd what can i say? It was disapointing. I shouldve known, and i kind of did, that the controlls cant be changed. It is in the end a port from a console game. So with me not having a controller i began to play Twister after about 10 minutes of gameplay on my keyboard and my lefthand thumb begin to hurt for whatever reason. (I still dont understand why but who cares). But the concept of the game was very nice. I would love to reccomend DMC 3 just as well and i probably will but for me, not getting past the second boss just because the controls are quite... Well it is a bummer i would say that you cant really get far without smashing your hands everywhere on the keyboard.\n\nBut now to DMC4. Finally it was downloaded as well. And i began to play right away. Not knowing much about this game just as well as with DMC 3 i thought it was just a consoleport either. But, yay, it wasnt and i could configure the keybinds to my liking. Now i wont put that as a con for DMC 3 but it is a bummer since i cant play without playing Twister on my keyboard :D\n\nBut back to the point. The game is very nice looking, runs very smooth and the combat is very nice. Like i said: I am on the bad side here so just take this as my opinion. The Story, The Charackters and the Plottwist at the very end, dont worry no spoilers, are very well thought out and makes the game really enjoyable. Even though i have to say that when you get to a certain point it can be a bit hard to beat 2 of the many bosses this game has for you. So to wrap it up real quick: This game is a nicely developed jewel that i would play over and over again just because it is that good. It is entertaining but challenging as well. You think you just did beat the hardest enemy in the game? Nope there is the next one right behind you. And if you think Agnus is hard to kill just wait for the sort of Endboss.\n\nAll in all i will recommend the game. Because i enjoyed it alot and will enjoy it alot more in the future.","November 11, 2014","true","12.3"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","3"

Its got handful of heavy-metal tunes that will pump you while playing.\nAnd i didn't even mention how PC port good is! PC players can experience turbo mode which speeds the game up 20% and the Legendary Dark Knight mode which is riddled with enemies.\nThe biggest problem with the game is ..... that it isn't finished.\nSeriously. The second half of the game is backtracking through the ALL Nero levels with some twists then and now.\nBut still, DMC4 is an wonderful, wonderful action game that keeps you pumped on while slashing through enemies with complex, deep combat system and beautiful visuals while keeping stable 60 FPS which puts to shame other games from the seventh generation.\nThere's not really much reason to buy this version of the game because DMC4 Special Edition was released in 2015 for only 5 dollars  more.\n9/10 a must have for every action games fan !","February 18","true","12.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

As you progress through the various levels and difficulties, you slowly accumulate power, and become something akin to a ♥♥♥♥-talking, pizza-eating badass.

SCREW YOUR DAMN GOAT SIMULATORS AND GET THIS GAME! IT'S LIKE 20 BUCKS OR WHATEVER! So as you may of guessed I'm a pretty big fan of the series with Dmc4 being my favorite of the series and 1 of my favorite games of all time.\n\nTo boil it down this game is a action hack and slash game. In my opinion this game has the best hack and slash mechanics of the DMC series and any hack and slash game I've ever seen. At no point in playing this game did I feel like I was pressing one button to win. Reaching SSS mid combo will probably leave you feeling pretty impressed with your self. The cut scenes range from cheesy to holy crap that was awesome.\n\nThe story is about Nero a new character of the series who works for "The order of the sword" A hot head swordsman who just so happens to be voiced by the same voice actor who voices  Ichigo from Bleach (Keep that in my mind as you rip demons in two). Kyrie is also new character of and is also voiced by a bleach voice actor(Orihime) Even her dress is a referrence to certain ark in Bleach. Utimately though she's a walking plot device. Although if there ever is a DMC5 I would love to see this character again maybe trained by Trish and Lady.\n\nAs for Dante if you liked him before you're gonna love him in this game. He's funny and fun to play as and fun to fight against. Not only is his character wonderfully developed but he also referrences (Story wise and gameplay wise) past dmc games in not only a awesome way, but in a way were nothing is spolied for new comers or redundant to veterans. Not only that but he also does all this without using flashbacks (Take notes 90% of animes).\n\nOne last thing to mention. The part where you back track half the game as Dante. This really isn't as bad or lazy as you think it is... Hear me out before you down vote. Back tracking has always been this lurking element of DMC but it's definitely more noticeable in this. Especially Dmc3 were you just play through the whole game as Vergil. Having Dante finishing what Nero started and giving back tracking a story purpose rather than just doing it for the sake of back tracking was kind of a nice touch. This was probably Capcoms way of killing 2 birds with one stone(aka Story and two playable characters) Don't get me wrong Dante could of just went to new ares with new Hell gates to fight the demons that survived Nero, but I'd like to give Capcom some credit on putting some thought into this. They could of easily just rinse and repeat dmc3.\n\nA quick note before I forget. If you were wondering about rebuying this game for pc and was worried it would be a bad port. Let me assure you this is a wonderful port, it feels just as natural as the console versions and looks godly on highest settings.\n\nIn the end I give this game a 9 out of 10.

The game is a bit easy, but there are ways to make it harder. The added difficulty is somewhat artificial though, as it adds more enemies and makes you take more damage. They constantly reuse the same enemies, bosses, music, and even areas. If you fall into a habit of reusing the same combos, it will definitely start to feel stale. All in all, it's a good game, but does suffer from laziness, as I expected more assets and variety.","December 13, 2011","true","30.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However, i will admit that Devil May Cry for the most part has enjoyable combat, and the boss fights are pretty damn satisfying.\n\nA few things that might put some people off would be the pacing in the second half of the story, though I imagine that this is done to let the player spend a good amount of time playing as Dante, which i will admit is satisfying in its own way\n\nTo those who didn't get a chance to get it on the Xbox 360 or Playstation 3, I would strongly reccomend this game provided that you own an Xbox 360 controller. Even if you do own it on either platform, I still feel that you should get it during a sale to enjoy the Legendary Dark Knight difficulty which has so far given me a really good first impression.","August 3, 2014","true","62.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Yaoi Boy (officially named "Nero") jerks off enemies big and small alike, using abilities like "Snatch" and "(nut) Buster" (although Buster is used far more often as there are few female enemies in the game that attract Yaoi Boy's attention) to make your enemies climax.\n\nYaoi Boy eventually meets the series' main protagonist, Yaoi Man, and has a hot showdown that about 3000 DeviantArt members have effectively chronicled every aspect of. When you eventually get to play as Yaoi Man, you'll notice that you actually don't jerk demons off, but engage in BDSM until they either die or ♥♥♥♥♥♥ again. Yaoi Man loves to get skewered by pointy objects, whether they be swords or something else. You'll see this happen to him at least once in every game. He is truly both a masochist AND a sadist.\n\nBut I digress. There is actually a newer version that includes both the Yaoi Man's brother, Sesshomaru, and the two female characters, the Yuri Gurlz.

Admittedly, it starts out kinda weak, but about a quarter of the way through it begins to get real good, then at around the middle point, when you take control of Dante(whom you kick insurmountable amount of ♥♥♥ with in true DMC fashion) is when you realize how awesome this game is. Its by no means flawless(what game is?), the Gyroblades and the dice "puzzles" were just annoying and in poor taste IMO, but too few and far between all the ridiculous ♥♥♥ kicking and platforming to come even close to ruining the whole experience.\n\nIt goes without saying that theres a lot of depth in the combat and the cutscenes are simply spectacular, but the cherry on top is the fact that DMC4 is just an exceptional PC port, probably the best port of all time because it rarely dips below 120fps while looking absolutely stunning, the only times it does drop is sometimes at the start of cutscenes(probably due loading) and also if you have vsync enabled it bugs out occasionally and drops to 60fps in some parts, but I tested it and with in-game vsync disabled its a constant 120fps otherwise. You'll probably wanna force vsync from your driver because it tears pretty bad.

This game is literally amongst the best games I have ever played I personally found it more enjoyable over Bioshock 2 which says a lot. May not beat MGS but this is definitely a must have for anyone who wants an original and fun experience that actually offers a lot of extra content without DLC and a challenge. Anyone who liked the original game for PS3 and the games before that for PS2  since it's a PSN exclusive so to speak must have this game. Personally I loved everything about it. THe camera can be a bit annoying but it's pretty damn good. The graphics are demanding but you can lower the settings significantly to make it playable on a laptop with a celeron card. Visusals are excellent and this carries  the fame the series had brought to make it so iconic and it carries a whole new storyline that could have been expanded still could be but who knows since the reboot.......won't leave much of a cliffhanger but does imply that this story isn't over. As for the mechanics yes it is hack and slash typical much like dark souls but in my opinion much faster paced and a true masterpiece while Dark Souls has a medieval tone and an actual intelligent lore/plot that doesn't make this a runner up definitely on par with Dark Souls 1 and 2. THis game offers a lot for 20 bucks high replay value much like the ones before this and a great cast of characters. IF you like Bleach anime well good news Johnny Yong Bosch the voice actor for Ichigo Kurosaki is Dante and Nero the main characters of the game. Each I think is unique and awesome in their own way but as a die hard fan since the first came out I would Dante is the best LOL. This game is not for children as well and the comical moments in such intense parts make the story all the more enjoyable for anyone. The game character you unlock are balanced and each one is completely unique in their style of fighting and such and the game like before and the reboot from 2012-13 still contains the epic and amazing stylized action that is like the matrix but a bit more badass in some moments. You're practically neo in this game as Dante or Nero. Great game 10/10.

No, not really. Is it hard and fun? Indeed it is! Considering it's age the graphics are good, it's fast paced and challenging. Depending on what type of gamer you are the game will last a long time. I myself have played for almost 30 hrs and I know I am not done yet, because I know I can get better and beat the game on a higher difficulty.\n\nThe graphics have improved from the third game and the enemies are a lot more interesting in this game than in DMC3. Although the number of bosses has fallen greatly, they are of higher quality. And although you have to fight them all twice, you get to do it with two very different characters allowing you to test yourself against yourself.\n\nSome people dislike Nero as a character. I sure don't. But even if I did I have to note the versatile playing styles presented. When you play as Nero the devilbringer is essential, but suddenly you switch to Dante, who has no such thing. The two playing styles are fun to master since this brings a revitalising element to the game.\n\nAlthough the story is kinda weak(even weaker than the story in DMC3), the game makes up for it by having a solid fighting mechanic taken from DMC3 and improved. As mentioned the devilbringer is really fun to use, and although Dante only uses 3 weapons in this game, he uses all 3 at the same time, meaning you don't have to switch at the shops, and you have a lot more to play with on the battlefield. Furthermore he also has trickster, gunslinger, swordmaster, and royal guard from DMC3 and like with the weapons you can use all on the battlefield.\nAs a bonus he gains Darkslayer later on which functions a lot like Vergil did in the Special edition of DMC3.\n\nIs this game better than DMC3? Not really sure. Is it just as fun? I would say so. I highly recommend this game. And if I should give it a score I would say 85/100 - not good enough to rank in the 90's but close to it!","April 22, 2014","true","45.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I waited for the whole summer sale to see if the price can drop lower than $5. It didn't, however a friend of mine was kind enough to gift it to me.\n\nThe graphics looks superb on the pc, and plays really well. The load time is non-existant compared to the ps3 version, however this may be the fault of the ps3. I am playing on the xbox gamepad, which the target button is RB in default controls. I thought it would be a good idea to change it to RT. However, once I get to Dante's part of the game, the control gets weird because I need the right side to be easily accessible for the weapon switch and target at all times!!!!!\n\nHELP!!\n\nAside from that, the boss battles are enjoyable. Like previous dmc games, they have patterns in their attacks. Your best interest would be to know when exactly they do their attacks so you can dodge and execute an attack. Another reason why boss battles are so enjoyable is the awesome soundtrack that plays in the background. You have the Techno Frog and Sworn Through Swords. However, there is only one track that plays for each character.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rapgamejotaro/recommended/45700/","rapgamejotaro","DJ_Lightbringer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rapgamejotaro/","336 products in account","Devil May Cry 4 is an ambitious, unfinished sequel that doesn't really have a hope in hell of improving as a whole upon what are considered it's true predecessors. That being said, it's still a decent game, but it just doesn't have the charm, the love of 3 or 1. Dante just feels a little bit emptier than before, and that goes for his dialogue and gameplay as well. Yes, style switching is really really cool! It's super fun, and when you get the hang of it everything just feels like one big sychronised movement. But in the end, the enemies feel like they aren't made for Dante, and downgrading his moveset to balance it out is kind of a cop out, I understand it's Dante, who never really puts his all into it and just plays for fun, but I just can't get behind the "DT upgrading style moves" thing at all. On top of that, Lucifer usually just feels like a placeholder for show, with no real substance to it, but I can say having the three guns is cool. All in all, the mainstay's gameplay is good, not as great as 3 Dante, but good.\nNow, when we get to Nero, I think he's actually solid as well, but I have to get something out of the way first. First half of the game with him(Takes me like 2:30 with S ranks, I think it's more around 3-4 hours for the real first time) is always painful, but you can lessen the burden if you level yourself in a fashion that allows you to really get in the flow of Nero, stuff like Snatch, Charge Shot, Streak, Split, Air Hike, and Enemy Hike are must haves for the first playthrough(MaxACT, Exceed 2, Exceed 3, and Calibur aren't really feasible to obtain first playthrough without replaying levels or the dreaded return to Nero level) That being sad, his more air based flowchart gameplay isn't bad at all, and you can certainly get creative with the character. What isn't creative is his writing, you have a 30/70 chance of a good cutscene with this kid, really. And by good cutscenes, I mean the DMC3 Dante attitude showing in Nero, with the twist of his abilities. Often times, it's KYRIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, showing that Devil May Cry 4 should've been named Devil Will Cry A Lot. Another issue is that Nero feels like he's as unfinished as the Dante backtrack, some of the enviroments, and the fact there aren't any actual alterations as far as I know to the levels they both share. Imagine how Nero would be if HE had buster styles? Buster style switching? There are so many things you can do with a giant blue hand, but Capcom would rather the game release with Nero just using it for masturbation, I suppose.\nNot only that, but the story feels like a rerun of 3 in a lot of ways and it also hints at a sequel which you know was only because they really really wanted to make more and expand on it, because clearly they weren't satisfied with the time they had.\nIt's a cool game, and it's worth a buy, but it's nowhere near the pinnacle of the series.","October 27, 2013","true","12.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

I thought it'd be like DMC 3 but with updated graphics and properly ported to the PC. Granted it looks great and actually works but there were no moments that made me grin with delight like in DMC 3. Most of the game you are playing as Not-Dante. I don't know why they made the new character and then made him just a supermarket own brand rip off of the character you actually want to be playing as. The level design is disappointing, you go through one way as Not-Dante and then back again as Dante. There are some really cool weapons but you have no choice with Not-Dante and you don't get much chance to use Dante's weapons before switching back to Not-Dante. One bit particularly annoyed me where (unless I was doing something wrong) you could not get past a hall of lasers if you had not bought the correct upgrades. Overall however I would recommend this over DMC 3 because it is fun and it actually works on the PC.","February 21, 2014","true","9.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ansinoa/recommended/45700/","ansinoa","ansinoa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ansinoa/","72 products in account","Awesome game. People say it's a bad PC port, but honestly I played with keyboard and controller each with one run through. It's doable on easier modes to play with keyboard, so if you're just looking to play the game and get the DMC experience out of one or two run throughs, it's totally worth it. I picked it up for 5 buckeroos on sale, and I'm not disappointed at all. This was my first entry into the series, and while you shouldn't expect too much plot wise, or even character wise, (coming in with no initial impressions of the DMC world whatsoever), you can expect a LOT combat wise. The game allows you to switch between Nero and Dante depending on the chapter in the game you are on, and the variances in fighting style mix up the game in an other-wise boring re-run through of all the levels (yes, the second half of the game plows you right in the opposite direction of the first- you go through all of the levels again pretty much.) The PC edition even adds a new difficulty- legendary dark knight mode, which I ran through the first 3 levels with a keyboard (so, it is doable), and have gotten to level 7 with a controller. It's pretty freakin' fantastic to fight 30+ enemies on hardmode, and makes you feel all around like a b055.  All in all, I've become very attached to all the characters, (except maybe Kyrie, but no hate) and would totally reccommend this game to anyone lookin' for a good ole' hack n slash. Personally, I'm an RPG fan all around, but this game has enough RPG elements to keep me in tune.

Lack of weapons/styles really makes the game feel a little dull.  Granted having Exceed ability from the get go really levels the playing field.  Master that tech and you'll breeze through the game.  And the Devil Bringer can make crowd management a bit easier, but overall the game shines when you're playing as Dante.  Have access to all five styles was something I dreamt about when I played DMC3.\n\nWhile the story for the games is a take-it-or-leave-it issue for most people, I'm just glad (more like exstatic) that there are no QTEs during the cinemas so I can actually enjoy Dante's cheezy one-liners and soliloquy's about ♥♥♥♥♥ metaphors.\n\nAlso, gotta give a shout-out to Turbo mode.  Definitely makes this version the best of the three.

It has the awesome characterization of Dante that I already came to enjoy in DMC 3 but a combat system that feels way better. DMC 3 had some performance problems like the camera switching the angle without warning, leaving you jumping down from platforms it took you hours to get onto. I love the idea and the implementation of the Devil Bringer Nero has. It can be used in so many ways - to evade, to attack, to defend, to stop enemy attacks etc. combined with useful sword combos (that also have really badass animations) makes the game worth playing for the combat system only. The background story is - if not very original - staged very well and I like all of the characters. The new look of "Lady" is a bit weird imo but you hardly see her so that is not a problem at all.

I can't say that it's not working though. This game really is entertaining because of the spectacular additional combos and epic characterisations (insert a random Dante here) and that very last statement makes me to question the overall point of the reboot's very existence. If you have actually finished DmC 4 you should know what I'm talking about here. It seems that with this game they were intruducing new characters and with it a new story arc which screams for a sequel, but a reboot? Whose idea was to reboot this when they were just about to revive it with some new and interesting stuff? Funny thing is how I'm saying this with DmC 4 being my very first one, so you can't even consider me as a diehard classic fanboy, I'm just being logical here. xD","August 2, 2013","true","35.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The game allows you to take on the role of Nero, and later Dante, the latter being the main protagonist of the series, having more weapons, however in DMC4, you are playing the role of Nero instead, who has comparitevly less weapons and movesets. The story of DMC4 unfortunately is not there. Although lengthy at around 12 hours, you will find yourself stuck in a cliche of Nero's love interest being snatched away, and he must rescue her (Mario I'm looking at you). You'll hack, slash, and shoot your way through hordes of varied enemies, across semi - linear levels. The latter part of the campaign however, is where you might see it getting repetitive, with you playing the story essentially in reverse order, but this time as Dante. Aside from the story, something that DMC4 does do right (and in my opinion, makes it worth getting), is the combat system. As mentioned before, fighting in DMC4 is like no other, and is smooth as butter. Both Nero and Dante are equipped with 2 categories of weapons: ranged and Melee. Nero having a double barreled revolver named Blue Rose, and a motorcycle engine sword, Red Queen. While this may seem little, each weapons has its own unique moves, and can be executed using combos on the keyboard. These moves can be linked with a little practice (I recommend learning how to Jump Cancel first), and can make for a very fun time. If that's not enough, Nero also has a special melee/pseudo ranged weapon named the Devil Bringer, allowing you to smash enemies into the ground WWE style, drag enemies closer to you, and pull off various high damaging finisher moves. On the other end of the spectrum, Dante is the one with the absurd amount of weapons, ranging from his signature pistols Ebony and Ivory, to a transformable suitcase called Pandora. What's more is that Dante has various styles to choose from, ranging from Gunslinger, to Sword Master, Royal Guard, and Trickster. Each has its own unique abilities to manipulate certain weapons. Gunslinger allows free play of Dante's ranged weapons, such as and aerial spinning top move with his pistols, rapid firing his shotgun Coyote-S, or adding new forms to Pandora. Sword Master allows Dante to perform special moves regarding his sword, Rebellion, his rocket-fist Giglamesh, and the explosive spear dealer, Lucifer. Royal Guard allows Dante to heavily mitigate damage from enemies, building up his rage bar, and eventually allowing him to release devastating counter attacks, and even transform into an invicible armor. Finally, Trickster allows Dante to move faster, short range teleport, and perform other stylish moves to better evade, and gain a position on enemies. All of these styles can be switched on the fly with no delay (unless you're standing still), and can be employed very effectively. All of this combat is rated by an in game on the fly letter grade system, ranging from a D-SSS. Overall, get DMC4 if you enjoy hack n' slash games with fluid combat, but prepare to be dissapointed should you buy it for the story. P.S.: For those who are wondering, there is indeed a "endless combat" mode, deemed Bloody Palace. While not exactly endless, its 101 floors will provide plenty of challenge and replayability.\n","February 25, 2014","true","39.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The fresh atmosphere of this game made things actually more enjoyable than I though before hand. Nero is one of my all time favorite characters, from his cocky orgins like Dante this makes for a good game which would only get you more pumped for DMC Devil May Cry. When I played this game on the PS3 It was a bit bad, only for how some of the graphics and quality overall. That being said it was just the looks and nothing more that was bad about it. The game is the best in the series in my eyes. If you want a good hack and slash style of game, this would be the one I suggest, due to the content not taking that much of a computer to run, and it brings a new play on characters, switching from Nero and Dante at points makes all of it even more enjoyable with the second playthrough.\n\nRating 8.9/10\n\nPros-\nNew Character to play\nGood look\nEasy controls (Even better with a joystick/Gamepad)\nInteresting Story\nGood for a couple plays and does not seem to let you down\n\nCons-\nOlder game means not many people want to play\nHack And Slash games end up being repetitive\nSearching for Gems can be a bit tedious.","June 24, 2014","true","1.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I picked up the first game around the time it came out and died terribly all the way to the second or third-to-last mission, and then I was stuck there for a while. I eventually finished the game, and I stayed a fan of the original even after playing through 2 (note: it's bad...really really bad), and became a bigger fan after playing 3 (my favorite so far). Oddly, 2, 3, and 4 were all directed by the same person, Hideaki Itsuno, though 2 was very different from the rest of the series. After 3 I was definitely willing to give it a go again, so I was very excited when 4 came out. Here I am FINALLY playing it in 2014, almost 6 years after the game came out in 2008, and I thought I'd write up what I thought of the game overall.\n\nStory\n\nIn Devil May Cry 4 you play as Nero instead of Dante. Nero is another white-haired sword-wielding Devil Hunter like Dante, but he's younger, likely around Dante's age in 3 which was a prequel. You start out the game with a scene that looks like it came right out of Spider-Man 2 where Nero's on his way to see a girl on stage and gets interrupted by demons. He manages to make it there as the performance ends, and the girl is so happy to see him that there's no real conflict that arrises from it.\n\nNero acts really aloof and stand-offish right away which makes him seem really unlikable, and even whiny. Shortly, though, Dante shows up guns blazing and Nero rises to the challenge of trying to fend him off while everyone else is running around in a panic. From then on Nero seems more and more like Dante himself. Starting with the scene where he's given his sword, and going on to each major demon he faces, Nero keeps up with the wise-cracks Dante is known and loved for, and I actually really ended up liking him as a character as the game went on.\n\nHalfway through the game you actually end up playing as Dante for a few missions. There's a lot of fan service here with Dante showing off in every cut scene he's in, with a bunch of silly over-the-top scenes evey time he gets a hold of a new weapon. There's a particularly funny moment when he and one of the villains act like they're in a play when they meet to fight on a stage.\n\nOverall I thought the story and characters were well written with the exception of Kyrie, the love interest. Kyrie is the classic damsel-in-distress and you never really learn much about her because she's always either captured and hidden offscreen or oddly mute. The actual plot surrounds a group of people wanting to use Sparda's power to become gods and take over the world which is somewhat similar to the main villain's goal in 3, but there's a little more going on here with more exposition and more characters.\n\nDesign\n\nThe world design and character design is very similar to the previous games. There are gothic ruins and a city that seems to have a Vatican City vibe to it, as well as a jungle (oddly enough). Characters look similar to what you'd see in 1 and 3, though Dante is sporting a goatee now and a set of boots that look like they may be a little too big. Every female character seems to have spontaneously become extremely well-endowed for some reason, including a couple of returning characters.\n\nCreature designs in this game are the best in the series in my opinion. One of the bosses is a giant frog with two lures similar to an angler fish, but the lures are shaped like human women. My favorite design is the Blitz which is a blind demon that uses lightning.\n\nThe weapon designs are interesting, the two most interesting and ridiculous being Pandora and Lucifer. Pandora is a demonic suitcase that can transform into multiple different guns including a ridable missile platform; yes, I'm serious. Lucifer is a very strange shoulder-mounted weapon that looks like a demon head with bat-like wing/arms. Lucifer allows Dante to create blades that explode a while after being stabbed into enemies, and he can throw the rose he holds in his teeth to manually detonate all of the blades at once; again I'm not making this up.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe gameplay in Devil May Cry 4 is similar in feel to the rest of the series. Nero has almost the same moveset that Dante does for his standard sword with a few differences. The ability that replace Stinger has an area of effect when it lands, for instance. Nero also gets an ability that gives feedback when there are secrets nearby which is absent when you play as Dante.\n\nNero has two new special abilities that change up combat a little bit. The first is his Devil Bringer which is his demonic right arm. The Devil Bringer allows Nero to pull enemies towards him and perform special grab attacks when their guard is down. This mechanic is easily my favorite addition to combat in this game.\n\nNero's second ability is the EX Gauge which the player has to rev up like an engine to perform more powerful attacks with the sword. I found this ability to be lacking because the extra time taken to charge attacks up didn't seem worth the little bit of extra damage you supposedly got from it. I got into trouble more often than not when using this ability either while revving it up or by missing my charged up attacks.\n\nDante's gameplay is similar to Nero's but it drops the two extra abilities I mentioned previously. Instead of the Devil Bringer grab system Dante gets access to the Style system from 3. This allows him to switch through a larger moveset for swordplay or guns, the Royal Guard style that adds a guard system that gathers energy from blocked attacks into an attack Dante can use against enemies, and the Trickster style that increases movement.\n\nDante gets access to more weapons than Nero, filling in the standard Devil Arm quotient for the game. Overall Dante is the more versitile character, and it feels a little jarring to get used to Nero's fighting style that focuses heavily on the grab-and-throw Devil Bringer, then change to Dante's extended moveset which drops the grab system entirely, and then back again.\n\nTo unlock new abilities in this game you use proud souls instead of red orbs like in previous games. Red orbs are still in the game and used as currency for items in the shop, and red orbs are still awarded from every enemy defeated and found floating around in missions. Proud souls are only awarded at the end of a mission. A convenient feature is the ability to unpurchase any ability any time you're in the shop which allows you to change your loadout between fights or missions if you would like to try out different abilities.\n\nDevil Trigger is available after a few missions, and it is basically the same as usual. Nero gets a couple of extra moves to use.\n\nSecret missions return in the game, and remain, in my opinion, uninteresting. They are usually very difficult to complete and give a reward of a blue orb fragment. Occasionally you will come across a secret mission as Nero or Dante that can only be completed by the other character. The game doesn't let you know this is the case, and you have to learn it on your own which can be a little bit annoying.\n\nThe difficulty curve in this game is high, like the others. There's a point when you have to fight Dante as Nero that took me 2 hours of tries to complete on Devil Hunter difficulty. There's also a couple of strange sections where you roll a die to move yourself around a gameboard to continue on, and because of the randomness of the die this is easily frusterating, especially at the end of the game. There's also a few times where it's hard to figure out exactly what the game wants you to do, but overall I was happy with the gameplay.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nOverall I really liked this game, and I would recommend it to anyone that would like to try it out. Currently in the series I am ranking 3 at the top, trailed closely by 4, with 1 at the bottom. 2 doesn't get to be on the ranking.","January 12, 2014","true","15.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

While the story is a bit meh, and has definite plot holes (kind of par for the course), it's serviceable enough to not be too much of a negative. While I can see why people hated on Nero before this was released, he's definitely a likable character, and he's pretty fun to play, definitely acting as a nice Sakura to Dante's Ryu and Vergil's Ken gameplay wise. On top of that, as mentioned, this is an exceptional PC release for a company that primarily makes console games (especially compared to the crap ports that DMC3 & RE4 apparently are). Tons of resolution options, quite a few graphical options, optimized enough to run on a lot of stuff apparently, the PC exclusive difficulty, and a DirectX10 version all packed into a sweet, relatively cheap package. It does have it's flaws though (the aforementioned plot holes, the fact that the second half is a mirror mode of the first half with some twists, etc.), but they pale in comparison to the pros. Despite it's flaws, this is definitely a damn good game (and the best version of this damn good game as well).","January 5, 2014","true","21.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Never played a DmC game before, grabbed this one, and I genuinely enjoy it. Although the number of abilities I have unlocked is minimal, the combat still doesn't get old. The boss fights are PHENOMENAL. There's a good amount of strategizing you have to do in them, and quick reaction times are a must along with good sequencing of dodges and attacks. Only thing I don't like at this point is the camera angles are always irritating and you can't control them, and I want more variety in the basic enemies to fight. Oh and getting new abilities takes a hell of a long time to have enough points, but that's not that bad. Will add more to this when I finish.\n\nEdit:\nFinished the game. The ending was a bit disappointing, but still a good game. The combat was a lot of fun throughout, and I figured out what to properly spend points on to make it even more fun. This is one of the few games in my steam library that I've actually finished playing if that tells you anything. Also, Dante is by far the greatest character in any game ever.

One place where the game trips up is that you spend half of the game playing as Nero he does use cool combos but the different weapons made it an icon. Dante is of course the best character and makes the backtracking thourgh similar places with different people worth it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/45700/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The initial impression of the PC edition of Devil May Cry 4 was a bit disconcerting. Sure, the visuals are breathtaking in high resolution, both throughout gameplay and during the well-directed cut-scenes. You're going to get a kick out of the atmosphere, especially if you're playing the DX10 version. The music, sound effects and voice-overs are top-notch, so no problems there either. The instant disappointment arrived when I tried to maneuver the main character via the awkward keyboard controls.The controls can be adjusted, though I'm afraid this won't help you much. You use the WASD keys for movement, while various actions and attacks are pulled off by pressing a variety of keys with your right hand. As a result, performing combos and stunts proved extremely difficult and to make things worse, they've completely excluded the mouse. Veteran PC gamers won't be too happy about this. To cut a long story short, if you're going to play this game, bring along a gamepad, preferably the X360 controller or one that's similar.Another huge concern is the camera. Frequently throughout the game players just aren't given the best angle to view the situation. There are many sections in the game where you cannot see where the hero needs to jump or where his enemies are. It can be a serious obstacle more often than not.The level designers did a good job of throwing enough challenges Nero's way (and Dante's, of course), although they clearly didn't think about varying things a little, since there are plenty of areas where players are forced to retrace their steps in order to progress.Somehow, even with the faulty controls, this game succeeds in reeling you in with its captivating graphics, stunning artwork and brilliantly designed monsters and characters. The story is, well, baffling to say the least.Trying to decipher what the writers wanted to say may take you forever (a common symptom in Japanese games, yes). Still, the overall presentation is excellent and makes up for the confusing narrative.The well-balanced character powers -- plus, plenty of combos and different melee and ranged attacks -- are the reason Devil May Cry 4 is so addictive. If you're stuck in a certain area, getting through a lengthy platform-jumping sequence or if you're fighting a tough boss battle, it's constant fun and a great challenge. To spice things up for PC owners, the developers fitted on a spanking new "Legendary Dark Knight" mode, offering you a chance to slice more opponents than ever before and increasing the challenge further. This is a fine element, but when it comes to PC extras, we kind of expected more from Capcom - essentially, more content, a new chapter in the story, more secret levels and similar things.Devil May Cry 4 is a good game if you're prepared to overlook certain downsides - first and foremost, the controls and camera. Next up, there's a solid amount of backtracking and there are a few recurring boss fights. Even so, the game is well-polished and it certainly looks sharper and better than on the console editions. What's more, it should appeal to fans and newbies alike.","January 30, 2014","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes, it will be be more expensive, but you will get more content. How I felt about this game before the Special Edition announcement? Amazing. The combat system in this game is spectacular, and I enjoyed every second of it. It's alot more fleshed out and dynamic compared to DMC3, what with it's instantaneous  Style Switching on the fly with the D-pad. The only issue is that this game was rushed, and it shows. It shows strongly with the Story, and maybe SOME sections of Level Design.

The game also will repeat the same map twice in which it shows that the developers were too lazy.\n\nGraphics : the game delievers an impressive visuals and art, there were times where I just stood there ( even though it ruins the main score at the end )\nand looked how beautiful the game is. I really liked the enemies art style which was combined with demonic look and humour.\nthe game will look at its best when you will deliever and outstanding combos at the poor demonic creatures. The cutscenes are just amazing and you will be entertained as if you watch a movie in the cinema.\n\nStory : Devil May Cry storyline isn't his strong side... I would say the story is predictable, sometimes stupid or illogical but non the less entertaining.\nthe good part are the characters which are funny in the second half of the game.\n\nAI: the ai in the game aren't really special or anything its just that they are sometimes unpredictable and when you raise the difficulty you will be encountering many diffrent foes which has diffrent abilities and thats where you will put your skill in to the test, and because they will be coming at you together it will be harder for you to fight and defeat them.\n\nSummary : DMC4 isn't the best game but non the less its a great game\nwhile the game has its down sides like reused maps\bosses\enemies and the puzzles are just annoying the game also delivers a fun combat, an entertaining cutscenes, funny characters ( and moments ), a hard challenge and great boss fights.\nI myself completed DMC4 more than 3 times which in total I spent over 45 hours ( on pc 15 hours on xbox 30 hours )\nand there is a reason to come back and play the game again with a higher difficulty ( there are 7 diffrent difficulties ).\nOverall I give this game a 8.5\10","August 2, 2013","true","15.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Most of the time it gives an impression that it's an horror game due to its creepy atmosphere and level design.  That is, until the monsters show up and the music amps it up in several levels.  It's a horror game alright. but's in the opposite perspective.  It's you, the player, who is the horror in this game.\n\nAs far as mechanics go, it's quite surprising that several combos can be done in only a single button.  It's all the matter of timing and precision in order to be able to pull these combos off.  Before I started getting this game I've been hearing that Devil May Cry is a masher's game.  There's a lot of mashing alright, but the rewards are higher if the presses are timed properly.\n\nAs for the stages, it's pretty straightforward and the "puzzle" elements are more into proper timing of using the Devil Bringer than anything else.  Some design flaws like bad camera angles can make the game more difficult than it should be.   I'll be updating this once I get to play more missions and unlock other characters.\n\nOverall, the game is fun and it's a good respite from games that you take seriously, particularly the competitive ones.","December 27, 2014","true","27.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

DMC 4 has an interesting story that follows a new character, Nero, and, everyone`s favorite, Dante. The gameplay is nice, the game has a good upgrade system. some moves are a little complicated, for example, ''Red Queen`s Exceed'', but you can read some forums about it, so it`s not a problem. The Cutscenes are amazing, you could beat the game, start it again and wouldn`t want to skip the cinematics. Battle Soundtrack is also epic and enjoyable. altrough the game gets very repetitive, as a DMC Series Fan I Give It A 9/10 ! In overall it`s a great game <3 You should definitely check it out !","January 7, 2015","true","12.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Trust me, I've played a lot more than what's shown.]\n\nWhile not quite reaching the perfection of DMC3, DMC4 still stands as one of the best of the genre. The tight gameplay, great music and unforgettable characters make this game very worthwhile to pick up if you're a fan of the genre.\n\nFirst off, this game looks gorgeous. The environments are very beautiful, and the setpieces are marvelous. The characters themselves look very good, even though they don't actually look too realistic. For a 6 year old game, the visuals definitely still hold up to this date. Also, this game can run perfectly even on mid-range rigs (my 820m could run it at a smooth 60fps all the way, although at 720p).\n\nThe gameplay is what really makes this game shine. The controls are very tight, whether you're playing on a gamepad or with a keyboard (gamepad is infinitely better, but keyboard is still great if you're used to it. If you're not, it won't take long to get a grip on the controls, trust me). You never really feel like deaths happen on the game's end, and not on yours.\n\nWhile hacking your way through the smaller enemies is great, the bosses is where this game is at its best. Recognising their patterns and acting accordingly is what it's all about, and it feels seriously good if you manage to pull it off. The gameplay distinction between Nero and Dante is also very good. Both have upsides and downsides, and I can't really choose favourites. Dante is so fun because of his different weapons and styles, and Nero is so much fun because of his Devil Bringer, and the many uses it brings with it. Who you'll like more is all up to you to decide.\n\nThe only real downside is how Dante's side of the story is a literal backtrack of Nero's story, down to fighting the exact same bosses. This bogs it down quite a bit, as there is a lot of missed potential here. However, fighting these bosses again with a different playstyle does feel fun and refreshing, so that makes up for it a bit.\n\nAll in all, this game is seriously great. Learning it may be easy and quick, but mastering it to get to the higher difficulties is very difficult and very fun. Pick it up if you like these games. You won't regret it. At all.","January 12, 2015","true","0.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You play as two demon hunters and guess what? You fight demons and save the world, big surprise. The story is narrated through unbelieveable cutscenes, where the characters get impaled and yet survive, do impossible stuff like deflecting bullets with other bullets, punch a giant stone wall into smithereens, transform a suitcase in a gunship and so on. Big explosions, action and stuff spiced up with crazy music. I was laughing hard during most of these cutscenes. The characters are totally crazy and over the top. There's this guy who wears a red coat and cowboy boots, who would get laughed out of any bar, that's totally crazy. The word is about to be destroyed and he acts all cocky and makes fun of his enemies. The dumbest hilarious cutscene involves him drawing a heart in a hell gate with blade-mines and then make it go boom, while flamenco music plays.\n\nThe music is terrific, loud and sang with a weird growling voice. The lyrics are beyond redemption and listening to some tracks would make any normal human being flee in terror, and its speed it's well known for causing tachycardia.\n\nThe gameplay is totally unrealistic. You have these two guys who wield swords as tall as they are and shoot unlimited bullets out of oversized guns. You can do physics defying stuff like launch an enemy in the air, follow it, swing your sword at it a few times, then hover on it showering it with bullets, then hit it some more, then kick its face a few times, plant a few blade-mines on it, then pull out a katana and slash it, then land in a crowd of enemies punching the ground causing an explosion and flip your shotgun at them like a nunchaku while shooting. On top of it, the action is so fast you can't really understand what's going on unless you're pro or someting.\n\nThere's this kid that's like the sheer power character. He can "act" his sword to make it ignite and spinning through the screen covered in fire, charge up gun shots to make groups of enemies explode and has the ability to execute high damaging grapples on foes. Than there's this other guys that has five "styles" that you can switch on the fly and every stile changes the function of your "style button" according to your equipped weapon. And speaking of weapons oh boy, this guy is a walking army, he has 3 melee weapons and 3 ranged ones and one of them has 4 normal firing modes. All of this stuff makes this guy incredibly complex to use. I mean, who needs all that variety? The combat system let's you pull out some infuriatingly complex combos if you are skilled enough but who cares?! Why can't I just spam Y and get SSS ranking?!\n\nEvery mission gives you a rank, that is a combination of diferent factors. I hear crazy fans actually play to best each other scores, while I can barely survive.\n\nThere's a lot of enemy variety, and some of them require special mechanics to be defeated or are generally better dealt with with specific tactics, forcing you to think fast and pick your target carefully. Who the hell wants to think when playing a game?!\n\nDid I mention that the game is incredibly hard? Because it is. If you never played an hack&slash you could even die on the second level boss! What madness is this? And, once you complete the game, you can start all over INCREASING THE DIFFICULTY! Who in their right state of mind would make things even more challenging than they already are?! Also, you unlock a game mode that essentially is a restless battle, not even one single platform section!\n\nDid I say the game had 2 harder difficulty modes? Sorry I meant 3, because the PC version pushes things even further with a mode where you fight an INSANE amount of enemies, like the ones you fight in Human mode weren't enough. Also, to make things even more frantic and hard, PC version adds  turbo mode that makes everything run faster. Unbelievable.\n\nSo, for all of these reasons, I declare this thing one of the best games ever made. Played back then on my deceased ps3, still playing it today on pc, listening to its amazing songs, enjoying its hilarious characters and having fun with the new game mode and the turbo function the excellent PC port provides. Too bad they couldn't finish the game properly but I think that just the Bloody Palace is more then enough to justify the price tag. It aged well... actually, it doesn't feel the age at all, it's waaay better than 99% of the crap we get today.","December 20, 2014","true","57.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Steam didn't track all of it.\n\nI'm a big fan of DMC3 and I mildly enjoyed the original. I feel like this project completely missed the mark in almost every possible way. I was extremely warm on it for the first few hours but it quickly wore out it's welcome.\n\nNow, it's visually stunning, and the PC port is flawless and enhanced. That's just dandy. But the mechanics in this game just do nothing for me. I can't stand playing as either Nero or Dante here. It just doesn't quite feel right, and many of the new moves and weaponry just seem like half-baked ♥♥♥♥ they chucked at a wall to see what would stick. Very little of it does.\n\nI didn't give half a care about the story from start to finish, and I ended up just uninstalling the game at the 2nd to the last boss and watching the ending online. The cutscenes are completely mind-numbing and over-the-top in ways I never thought imaginable, this side of the Metal Gear Solid remake Twin Snakes. They don't seem to realize that the stupidity of DMC3 was charming, but you can't just make it twice as stupid and expect it to be twice as entertaining. Every ounce of this story, dialog, and even motion capture and character body language is painfully annoying. I cringed for hours upon hours watching this game unfold. I can only assume this is yet another case of lost in translation, but I've never seen an entire cast of characters say so many words without telling me ANYTHING. Japan. Just stop.\n\nI would suggest you only play on the easiest difficulty and blast through it on automatic mode as a button masher. It's not at all worth learning how to properly play the game. I don't care about the combo system at all, and it becomes essential to beating most bosses without cheaping your way past them with health items. I only ever beat one challenge stage, for this reason. I will never understand how someone can stay airborn for 30 seconds in a DMC game, and frankly, I shouldnt have to learn. I should just be able to enjoy the game to completion.\n\nI'm eager to move onto the DmC reboot. At least it looks like it's more tuned in on an English audience and typically when a fanbase hates an entry to a series I'm sick of, it means I'll end up liking it for it's fresh ideas.","April 15, 2014","true","4.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

You play as two demon hunters and guess what? You fight demons and save the world, big surprise. The story is narrated through unbelieveable cutscenes, where the characters get impaled and yet survive, do impossible stuff like deflecting bullets with other bullets, punch a giant stone wall into smithereens, transform a suitcase in a gunship and so on. Big explosions, action and stuff spiced up with crazy music. I was laughing hard during most of these cutscenes. The characters are totally crazy and over the top. There's this guy who wears a red coat and cowboy boots, who would get laughed out of any bar, that's totally crazy. The word is about to be destroyed and he acts all cocky and makes fun of his enemies. The dumbest hilarious cutscene involves him drawing a heart in a hell gate with blade-mines and then make it go boom, while flamenco music plays.\n\nThe music is terrific, loud and sang with a weird growling voice. The lyrics are beyond redemption and listening to some tracks would make any normal human being flee in terror, and its speed it's well known for causing tachycardia.\n\nThe gameplay is totally unrealistic. You have these two guys who wield swords as tall as they are and shoot unlimited bullets out of oversized guns. You can do physics defying stuff like launch an enemy in the air, follow it, swing your sword at it a few times, then hover on it showering it with bullets, then hit it some more, then kick its face a few times, plant a few blade-mines on it, then pull out a katana and slash it, then land in a crowd of enemies punching the ground causing an explosion and flip your shotgun at them like a nunchaku while shooting. On top of it, the action is so fast you can't really understand what's going on unless you're pro or someting.\n\nThere's this kid that's like the sheer power character. He can "act" his sword to make it ignite and spinning through the screen covered in fire, charge up gun shots to make groups of enemies explode and has the ability to execute high damaging grapples on foes. Than there's this other guys that has five "styles" that you can switch on the fly and every stile changes the function of your "style button" according to your equipped weapon. And speaking of weapons oh boy, this guy is a walking army, he has 3 melee weapons and 3 ranged ones and one of them has 4 normal firing modes. All of this stuff makes this guy incredibly complex to use. I mean, who needs all that variety? The combat system let's you pull out some infuriatingly complex combos if you are skilled enough but who cares?! Why can't I just spam Y and get SSS ranking?!\n\nEvery mission gives you a rank, that is a combination of diferent factors. I hear crazy fans actually play to best each other scores, while I can barely survive.\n\nThere's a lot of enemy variety, and some of them require special mechanics to be defeated or are generally better dealt with with specific tactics, forcing you to think fast and pick your target carefully. Who the hell wants to think when playing a game?!\n\nDid I mention that the game is incredibly hard? Because it is. If you never played an hack&slash you could even die on the second level boss! What madness is this? And, once you complete the game, you can start all over INCREASING THE DIFFICULTY! Who in their right state of mind would make things even more challenging than they already are?! Also, you unlock a game mode that essentially is a restless battle, not even one single platform section!\n\nDid I say the game had 2 harder difficulty modes? Sorry I meant 3, because the PC version pushes things even further with a mode where you fight an INSANE amount of enemies, like the ones you fight in Human mode weren't enough. Also, to make things even more frantic and hard, PC version adds  turbo mode that makes everything run faster. Unbelievable.\n\nSo, for all of these reasons, I declare this thing one of the best games ever made. Played back then on my deceased ps3, still playing it today on pc, listening to its amazing songs, enjoying its hilarious characters and having fun with the new game mode and the turbo function the excellent PC port provides. Too bad they couldn't finish the game properly but I think that just the Bloody Palace is more then enough to justify the price tag. It aged well... actually, it doesn't feel the age at all, it's waaay better than 99% of the crap we get today.","December 20, 2014","true","57.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Nero isn't the most pleasant protagonist but he's tolerable and the game is pretty fun. Devil Bringer is an enjoyable feature but the fact that Nero lacks the tricks that Dante has means that fighting enemies you can't use devil bringer on is irritating, and going through the levels as a character without devil bringer (Dante) is a bit simplistic since you can't do any of the platforming/puzzle solving bits.

The 3D character models have a very arcadish quality appearance. Most levels despite having poor texture upon closer inspection look eerily detailed and realistic like Resident Evil 2 for its time. There is a lot of cinematics with female characters that show off their sex appeal. For some reason it made me laugh hard, but in a good way.\n\nThere are some horrible viewing angles as the camera is either static or on rails. But it's not frustrating and sometimes you may rotate the camera via arrow keys.\n\nThere are no auto-saves, so you've got to be careful, because you can easily forget to manually save. I felt like for every hour spent playing, it felt like 3 hours had elapsed.\n\nI began resuming this game from Dante (about 60% in) a few days ago. Controls were easy to pick up again. There is also a very light cash-in advancement RPG skill system in place.\n\nA simple but decent game even for 2013.","January 30, 2013","true","17.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

The combat system is very in depth and there is always more room for improvement, even for the greatest masters of the game. It also has many different difficulty levels that will keep you busy for HOURS. You get to play as either Nero, who has a very interesting combat system because of his grab ability, and Dante, who has a variety of weapons and fighting styles to choose from while in game, giving an indefinite number of possibilities for combos. Plus, the game is very pretty, even on the lowest graphics settings, and for a PC port, it is not that bad.\n\nNow here's the part where you yell at me for stating my opinion. My main criticisms of the game lie heavily in the story, which I honestly believe was bland and tasteless. Dante isn't the main character, but instead, it's Nero, who in my opinion, acted too much like a whiny ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (though his combat is very unique). A majority of the characters are completely one-dimensional and don't really serve any purpose other than being the damsel in distress or the power-hungry bad guy or the envious rival . I pretty much only enjoyed the parts of the story where Dante was included because at least he was cheeky in an enjoyable way. Although I liked Nero's combat style, it got old for me pretty quick.\n\nOther downsides include the camera problems (which I am pretty sure is typical for a Devil May Cry game), a lack of costumes, the hideous amount of backtracking which puts Dante's role in the game to shame (I am talking you're backtracking for almost HALF THE GAME), and the lame final boss whose attack patterns are very predictable. Plus there's not much innovation put into the level design, which brings me back to the backtracking issue. I honestly felt like I was playing a somewhat incomplete story.\n\nOverall DMC4 was a mostly fun ride from start to end. It does bring back Bloody Palace as well as has a couple fun bosses. What it fails at in areas such as level design and completeness, the game makes up for it with an awesome combat system, beautiful visuals, and long playability. It wasn't as good as Devil May Cry 3, but better than DmC Devil May Cry.\n\nOverall I give Dante May Backtrack 4 an 8/10\n\nTL;DR The gameplay is amazing, but the story was very lackluster and unfinished","March 21, 2015","true","24.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However the game is old and gets boring after a few long sessions with in the week. i have competed the game multiple times and now no longer want to continue playing the campaign due to how long i have played the game (on ps3). But if you are new to the DMC series i recommend you buy this one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/recommended/45700/","burshoo","Bushro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/","155 products in account","There isn't a whole lot to be said that hasn't already been said. This game is good. Really good. It's a hack and slash that bases itself in ridiculousness. There are more ways to take out your foes than French restaurants have ways to say, "Your taste in wine is atrocious." Excellent combat, great soundtrack. The cutscenes are actually enjoyable to watch and are not prerendered; They use the in-game engine, which is as detailed as it is colorful, a refreshing change of pace from other games of its generation. In terms of port quality, it's beautiful. Even on my absolute toaster of a computer, the game manages to stay at around 85 frames per second, even when the screen is crowded with baddies with the PC exclusive Legendary Dark Knight difficulty. The keyboard controls won't do you well, however. I'd recommend getting an Xbox 360 controller, which is nearly perfect, except for two points I'll get to later.\n\nThe game has a ton of replay value. Aside from Bloody Palace, there are a plethora of unlockable moves, difficulties, and artwork/biographies, but I have to note that the latter is stuff that anyone can find in a quick search on Google. Really, the most rewarding part of this game is the game itself, and overcoming the increasing challenges it throws at you by practicing and mastering the combat. Even after beating everything the game keeps track of with an S rating, I still don't feel like I'm as good at it as I could be, and this is a welcome feeling to have.\n\nCons: Aside from fewer style moves than in DMC 3, the biggest issues I noted were\n\n- The camera. It gets stuck on scenery and can get jammed into places that make it impossible to see what you're doing (especially during boss battles). The targeting is also a pain. It seems that no matter which of the targeting modes I choose, I can never lock on to the enemy I want. When the camera and targeting issues combine, combat feels much harder than it should be.\n\n-The length. The various difficulty options are a blast, but the core game is just too short. 20 missions, okay, but 3 of them are only boss battles. Dante is fun to play as, but he only gets 7 missions, and most of them are backtracking. The one unique boss fight he gets is its own level and can be completed in about 10 minutes. It feels like two halves of a game are slapped together here, with Nero missing a big chunk of missions and Dante not having much of an opportunity to show off his insanely large moveset.\n\n- The controller. I know, I know, it's not really a criticism of the game, but I know that most people are going to be using an Xbox 360 controller with this, and while it is the best of the controllers I tried, it has issues which negatively show in the game. The D-pad is horrid, it makes instant style switching with Dante touchy to the point that combos will be screwed up. Nero is another problem. I found myself doing "the claw" with my right hand many times during combat, as I was charging the exceed meter, charging the gun, adjusting the camera, and dodging attacks at the same time. Changing the controls only helps so much; There is simply too much going on at one time for the few amount of buttons on the controller.\n\nIt's pretty fun, and this is where I'd crack a joke about it being like Dark Souls with less anime, but it's interesting I should bring up Dark Souls, because...\n\nI got this just before DMC 4 Special Edition was announced, which is set to come out this summer, and is going to be offered as its own thing. If you pay for this version now, you're not getting the full deal which comes out in a matter of months. As such, I have to strongly suggest just waiting for SE.","March 26, 2015","true","98.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I beat 1-4 all on DMD mode, including 2. That means I beat DMC2 at least 5 times. DMC3 was the cake. DMC4 was like putting ice cream on top of the cake, delicious. I was iffy about Nero, and he's different than Dante, but that isn't bad. He's a hot-headed, cocky, badass and has a good arsenal of moves. Unlike Dante, he has no weapons to unlock. Dante, however, has unlockable weapons and the awesome on-the-fly Style switching system. Nothing beats kicking ♥♥♥ while using Trickster to dodge everything, while throwing in some Dark Slayer Style or Swordmaster. It's awesome, runs beautifully on PC, and the inspiration to name my first born son, Nero.\n\ntldr; DMC4 rocks, 'nuff said","December 30, 2012","true","7.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphics hold up really well for being made in 2008. The combat is flashy and fun, while being deep. The replay value is really high, having many difficulties, different characters, and secret mini missions. The story isn't the strongest factor, but it isn't that bad. Overall it is a great game, just make sure you connect a controller.

But between DMC 5 and DMC 4 they are very different, these are the only two i have played so far but i have to say i like DMC 5 better, to me its more fun and it makes more sense for DMC to be that type of game and it felt like it worked better than the style this game takes. But still this game is very good i just find the other one more action packed i should say and it ended up being more satisfying. i also liked the style of DMC 5 better too, i like how its a modern style rather than gothic and i like the young dante best he was cocky and funny as hell.(i also hate nero he's like a dante wannabe, dante is way better)\n\n\n\nResult: 8.5/10\n\nI'd reccommend this game any day","November 1, 2014","true","11.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This is also my first ACTUAL review.\n\nPersonally, I give this game an 8/10 with the following reasons:\nGood characters\nFun bosses\nDecent graphics\nDante's weapons. Need I say more?\nNero's screaming for Kyrie\n\nAlright, so playing this game my first order of business was to edit the controls. Normally, people complain about the controls of every single game that was created for the console and put on a PC; this game was very simple for adjusting controls, but really wanted you to work for it when it came to playing. I could go on about the controls in the game, but let me say this: I got to a point where the way I adjusted my controls made the game better than what it was AFTER I got my PS3 controller to play it with. Yep. I made the game better on the Keyboard than on the Controller. In Dark Souls, that'd be IMPOSSIBLE; in this game, it's pretty easy. This game earns a 10/10 for controls on that alone.\n\nNow, not to spoil the game with the story of it, I'm only going on the gameplay aspect; you want the story, use google. I played this game entirely for the gameplay. Nero is pretty simple to control, but if you're using an older machine, you're going to have serious problems. The lag extremely effects how well you react; most times you can simply press a button when a game a local-based lags on your computer and it will slowly move. In DMC4, if you press anything, the lag actually makes the game ignore your command entirely. Backwards compatibility, I label this a 4/10.\n\nThe biggest problem I had with this game is that Nero has limited weapons but does 3x as much damage as Dante, so killing as Dante takes a long time. Also, if you're new to the game, Dante will make you cry when you're fighting against him; this is coming from a guy who beat Heaven and Hell mode on DMC3 once. Dante will actually gain ALL of his weapons after you beat the game once; and believe me, he'll use them against you on the first stage of your next game. Dante also has a tendency to avoid whatever you throw at him unless you force him on the offensive and dodge his attacks yourself. Even then, he's faster than Nero, so good luck. And on your second playthrough, the first level turns out to be a major challenge. I didn't bother with Heaven or Hell mode for this exact reason. 3/10 on difficulty\n\nAfter level 1, the game is pretty enjoyable so long as you play as Nero. However, when you switch to Dante, everything becomes a major challenge. The lag becomes real, damaging enemies becomes tedious and to replace the cool minigames Nero had, Dante has immediate danger and headache inducing puzzles 24/7; in one level, all areas that were connected are redone to have portals replace the connections between them. Basically, you're going to go through a new maze a la Silph Co. teleporters. Oh, but these aren't exactly connected to each other; you can go into one and then decide to backtrack and come out of a totally different portal then the one you walked through. If you're like me and get busy playing games, this is a struggle.\n\nThe game has a random scene with nothing but inuendos for no apparent reason whatsoever.\n\nAside from that, this game was good. I don't like to praise good games or attack bad games, more show a contrary side to my own opinion. If you want my controls, message me. They worked exceptionally.","October 2, 2014","true","43.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The Devil Bringer sucks. The story sucks. The gameplay sucks. The humor sucks. This is not DMC. This is ♥♥♥♥. The new reboot DMC will be more in line with the old games than this, and unless they pull the same level design ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t this game had, where literally the entire second half of the game is repeating the EXACT SAME bosses and levels, there's not really any way to sink lower. If you're desperate for a hack and slash combo whoring game, this will get the job done, but it's no where near the quality of DMC 1 or 3, and unlikely as good as the reboot. Also, this is exactly somewhat playable with a keyboard. Somehow.

Everything about the combat feels right. But then you get about 4 hours in and have to replay the same levels you just played but just in the reverse order. I thought hey, this is just temporary. And switching from Nero to Dante made it somewhat fresh to play the levels again.\n\nBut no no, it was not temporary. The game kicks into full lazy mode by making you fight the bosses you just fought as Nero again with Dante. But then it gets somehow lazier when it makes you switch back to Nero again in the last two missions, one of which is a boss rush mode against bosses you've fought twice before now.\n\nJust in the end, I don't enjoy replaying the same levels twice just in the reverse order. Beating the same bosses three times is just boring. And reusing so much content is just poor design. While there's a good ammount of fun to be had, there's also a greater ammount of monotony to suffer through.\n5/10 okay","June 25, 2014","false","13.6"," 19 of 49 people (39%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","39","19","49","2","0"

Finally finished it so I can post a review. Please be advised that I'm an avid DMC fan and finished the infamous DMC3 a couple of times, so my opinion is valid.\n\nFirst, let's get the good stuff out of the way: Spectacular graphics, smooth framerate, the combat is OK, some amazing fight choreographies. Done.\n\nThe bad I will bring to you in the form of a dialogue between the two lead designers. If it helps think of them as Gonad ((c) by Yahtzee) and Testy.\n\nA: "Let's make DMC4."\nB: "K. Sounds like $$."\nA: "Sure is. Let's be careful not to make it too easy. We want g4m0rz-moneys and they like it rough."\nB: "K, but first things first. Dante or someone new?"\nA: "Dante AND someone new! Damn, I'm good."\nB: "Hmm why not. How should he look, behave, talk and fight?"\nA: "Exactly the same."\nB: "What, really? Won't that confuse and annoy the players?"\nA: "Te he, it's so devious. Let's make everything extra annoying so people play it because it's hard and not because it's good. Do you remember those special missions that allow you to earn blue orbs?"\nB: "Fcourse. I never liked that when you lost energy during those missions that the damage wouldn't carry over to the normal gameplay."\nA: "That's what I was thinking. Make it permanent. Oh, and if you buy something, make EVERYTHING ELSE MORE EXPENSIVE!"\nB: "Excuse me?"\nA: "As soon as you buy something, everything else get more expensive. Every single time you buy something."\nB: "..."\nA: "It's ingenious! So annoying. Players won't be able to plan any purchases beyond the first one. Gnahaha...!"\nB: "Consider it done. I assume we include incredibly frustrating jump sequences from beyond hell with fixed, bad camera angles, respawning enemies and so on for maximum annoyance?"\nA: "DO YOUR WORST! Oh, and how about enemies that have an unblockable attack while down with no tell whatsoever that disrupts your combo while you are slashing them? That should take care of those uber-gamerzz."\nB: "Sounds a bit extreme and unlike DMC to me, but OK. Oh, oh, I always wanted to include a board game segment into a video game. Something where you don't have any control and it just annoys you and goes on forever with seemingly endless enemy hordes spawning again and again and again and-"\nA: "Stop, I get it, I get it. Why not include it in two places, one right before the end. Make that extra annoying, like an hour or so to beat."\nB: "An hour? Are you sure? Or do we now allow saves within a level when quitting the game?"\nA: "Are you CRAZY? Once the g4m0r shuts down the game he has to do the whole level again. That goes without saying."\nB: "What if he's right before finishing this annoying herpderp fakksheet board game level and suddenly has to quit beacuase of real life and stuff?"\nA: "Well, then he would have to deal with the unfairness. He's gonna hate it, he's gonna love it. How long can the game be with our current budget?"\nB: "About 9 hours."\nA: "No, too short, not annoying enough. Backtrack the whole game.

Play only if you absolutely cannot live without Devil May Cry, have beaten the third one countless times and cannot get into the new DmC (which I very much like, btw). DMC4 is such a soulless, lazy, uninventive and so very, very much annoying cashin of a game that it's not even fun to beat it to prove your skill.","September 25, 2014","false","15.3"," 15 of 42 people (36%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","36","15","42","4","3"

Instead, you spend a bunch of time trying to figure out how to grapple to that platform, pushing around cubes to  unlock a door, searching some bland castle for orbs to unlock some skills, or just back-tracking trying to figure out where you are supposed to go next. There was very little to keep me interested for very long. This game plays like a mediocre early PS2 era game.

There are a lot of twitch tricks you can use to take Dante for a ride (And less so Nero, who is frightfully boring and whose only gimmick is just throwing timed button presses into his combo as an ersatz action selection.) and pummel the array of hapless idiots who pose no threat to you, and the game only holds value as long as you enjoy exploring Dante's combo system as it cannot challenge or interest you otherwise.\n\nDon't play it "properly." The campaign is dreadful. Your moveset is locked away such that you will need almost two full playthroughs to unlock every move for each character. The backtracking would not be so bad if the levels were so boring the FIRST time, broken up with so many empty rooms and dumb physics puzzles and platforming. Just grab a debug cheat, unlock everything and pick and choose which levels you want to play.

Devils NEVER Cry.\n\nDevil May Cry 4 is a style simulator with beat em up elements. You play as Nero, a resurrected Roman Emperor in the body of a teenager with a jacket that has more zippers than a Kingdom Hearts character. Armed with his demon arm, an intensifying revver blade, and cardboard girlfriend, you journey across Narnia to find the Grey Fox.\n\nThe battles evolve as you play. Because of the multiple styles you can use, the game can get pretty immersive. Even in the toughest of situations, your enemies will see that you'll fight until eternity. Sadly, there is no multiplayer like DMC 3 allowed, but if you come with me, we'll stand and fight together against Capcom and their abomination known as DmC: Devil May Cry.

If you enjoy fast-paced hack and slash I'd recommend it, though it's not too fast by default. I'm about to drop some hate on it, but by all means play it, I hate it but love it just enough to keep playing. 6/10\n\nBe Aware That:\n- Enemies can fall through the map, with some luck and gunfire you may lure them back, if not you have to restart.\n- If you want a challenge this game isn't for you. Every time you lose (to a boss for sure) they'll be handicapped unless you restart the whole level. This is not optional, and is rather insulting. So don't die if you like to brag about beating it on the hardest difficulty, otherwise you'll be bragging that you lost until you ultimately won from all the losing.\n- DX10 mode will cause crashes durring cutscenes, sometimes before you even realize that one is taking place, causing you to restart.\n- The camera is your greatest enemy. Forward will become backward and then forward and then backward before you know what's going on. Combt controls also change based on the camera position.\n- Dante's AI is extremely lame, borderline godly due to faster animations, and also possesses invulnerability frames/animations that will prevent him from being damaged as he slowly does whatever he pleases. (I've yet to test this but I'm pretty sure all the awesomeness of this isn't available when you play as him, so enjoy that.)\n- Inventory breaks the 4th-Wall and saves items used before your death; stupid on so many levels.\n- Side Missions break from the story in a terrible way and aren't really disreable in my opinion.\n\nOne Awesome Thing You May Not Know About:\n+ You may roam between levels and farm/get lost, pretty sweet.","November 8, 2014","true","24.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a great way to introduce newcomers into the world of Devil May Cry and the hack-and-slash genre, while keeping the more experienced players engaged. (tl;dr at the bottom)\nI have to say for this being a somewhat older game it still holds up great in comparison to some of the newer games compainies are pumping out left and right. The story is easy to follow even for people who haven't played the previous games. I myself didn't have access to a controller at the time I bought this game but the keyboard controls aren't actually all that bad. I would recommend if you plan on playing on higher difficulties you may want to get a controller, it will make everything much easier.\nEnvironments are well deisgned but repeated in the second half of the game which can be on the side of tiring. The battle system really makes you feel like you're in control of whats happening, especially with the power of Nero's devil arm. The characters are well rounded with great voice acting, along with the character designs themselves. The optional missions are also a great addition, letting you upgrade your characters even further, or to give a change of pace from the story. With the many different difficulties it gives it great replay value.\n\ntl;dr\nIf you want to cut some demons apart with a giant, flaming sword this is the game for you. It's fun, straight forward, and fast paced. Hope you don't mind backtracking for the last half of the game. 9/10.","November 5, 2014","true","34.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like playing as Nero. I think what other people have categorized as whininess, I categorize as having a character and humanity other than pure snark. His combat is unique from Dante's, and I enjoyed every second of this game.\n\nWhy 8/10? Because, as great as Nero is, he sure isn't Dante. You do get to play as Dante, but only for 8 missions, all of them backtracking and featuring the same bosses that Nero fought. And all of these bosses feel weird when fought with Dante, as they're all built around Nero's moveset. And Dante's combat has received a huge upgrade from the greatest action game ever with the much needed ability to switch styles at will! It's great that he's in here, but it feels like such a fully featured playable character had much more unique content planned for him than none at all! I'm convinced that he did, and they ran out of time to build more than just a handful of stages to be recycled over 20 missions.\n\nThis makes the DmC reboot so tragic. I actually like it a lot, and Ninja Theory made one of my favorite games: Enslaved. But Devil May Cry was far from stale enough to deserve a reboot. 4 entries (3 of them the most solid actioners you can find) was far from the milked bone dry state of Resident Evil. But if they progressed with Dante as the main character of a true Devil May Cry 5, imagine the sheer awesomeness that would unfold!\n\nOne thing to note is the high quality of this PC port. I'm running a laptop with no dedicated graphics card, so I'm pretty used to low-to-mid settings and 30-40 FPS. Imagine my surprise when a Japanese console game gets 60 FPS on max settings, all the time. I've never seen something so well optimized besides maybe Half-Life 2. This game looks amazing, and it makes me wonder why Ubisoft games that look nowhere near as good require triple the horsepower. Maybe Capcom felt sorry for the horrible state of DMC3 PC, so they made this as good of a port as possible. Really impressive.\n\nThe graphics are amazing. My only gripe is a small one, about very large ones. Seriously, you Japanese pervs. Boobs do not behave in that way!\n\nI highly recommend Devil May Cry 4, but not as much as I would if the game were built around Dante.","December 26, 2014","true","22.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll be honest; 3 still holds the title for crunchiest sword swings, but that doesn't mean 4 is bad; oh hell no. While the weapons may not seem to pack quite the same weight they seem to in 3, the combat is easily some of the most versatile it's been yet which more then makes up for that. It's a shame what went on with the development, but that doesn't make it any less of a good game. It's going to be getting it's own Special Edition in the future too so if you miss the holiday sale keep an eye out for that.","December 18, 2014","true","27.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It may not be as revolutionary but it is an improvement in almost every aspect. The biggest complaint about it is the backtracking that takes place during most of the second half of the game. This is a little overblown though, as the playable character for that part has a different fighting style and the environments have also changed quite a bit. Then again, and while there is a variety of bosses, you will have to fight them again and again which ends up being little bit too much. The PC version of DMC4 is better than the console versions, unlike the troubled port of DMC3. The performance is great and the graphics are nice but not outstanding. The soundtrack takes after DMC3, so it may not be entirely to your liking but even then it shouldn't bother. The plot is passable, it has a few surprises, some funny moments and many well choreographed cut-scenes. Just make sure you have a gamepad - the game can be played with a keyboard but only if you prefer fighting the controls instead of the enemies.","July 2, 2011","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Over-the-top fun characters, story and cutscenes. Disappointing lack of additional playable characters.\n\nFinally got around to beating this game and I have to say, I'm sorry it took me so long (due to technical bugs corrupting my game saves and such). The gameplay is as strong as it's been in the long-standing franchise, better actually as you get to play as new hero Nero as well as Dante later on in the game. They both play very differently but offer equally compelling modes of fun and over-the-top signature DMC aerial & ground combos mixed with guns but I was partial to Dante's gameplay as I found his ground combos, 4 styles and additional weaponry to offer a lot more versatility and enjoyment. In fact, Dante sports some of the most creative and badass weapons that I've had to joy to play with and for them alone the game is worth getting.\nBut I digress, aside from the incredibly fun, tight and varied combat the game takes you through cool-looking environments typical of the series that are are both grand in scale and that offer neat platforming elements and hidden collectibles/missions that round up the game nicely.\nHowever, as it also typical of the franchise there is a fair amount of backtracking as you need to go back and unlock certain areas once you gain the appropriate new ability (which is fine) but this is further compounded by the fact that you revisit the same exact areas when you later play as Dante. I find this to be shame and a sign of the development team cutting corners and saving time & money, but it ultimately cheapens the quality of the game. What's more is that you fight the exact same 3 bosses as Dante that you did as Nero which just feels like a let-down and a missed opportunity to have turned a really good game into a fantastic one.\nNext, the story. There isn't anything really original about it as it's your standard corrupt organization-turned-zealots-who-try-to-remake-the-world-in-their-image-and-the-hero(s)-have-to-stop-them fare. Despite this I really enjoyed it thanks to the playful & devil-may-care (lawl, see wut I did there? :P) attitudes of both main characters although it's a lot more pronounced and entertaining in Dante's case than it is with Nero. The story is also filled with over-the-top HILARIOUS cutscenes such as a back & forth theatrical soliloquy between Dante and one of the game's bosses that is one of the funniest moments that I've experienced in a game :). Coupled with this are lots of extremely stylish and badass sequences that really help to further set the tone for the game and give you an appreciation for how powerful these characters really are.\nAs for the shortcomings of the game I found the use of fixed camera angles in many locations to be rather frustrating as it's easy to have your character come to a sudden stop or start running in the opposite direction when you enter a new area where the camera angle is different from the previous one. I also felt that 2 of the more difficult moves (for Nero) were overly complicated to perform as they require incredible reflexes and timing which I and I'm sure many other gamers just don't have and so I never really used them. This is in contrast to similiar combo-heavy games like God of War, Bayonetta and Castlevania: Lords of Shadow that have as complicated a move and ability set but where all the controls are accessible and aren't an exercise in frustration.\nIt's also rather unfortunate that despite being able to unlock 2 additional harder modes (and 2 even tougher after that, h.o.l.y.c.r.a.p.!) after having beaten the game there is no further option to play as Trish/Gloria or Lady which is another missed opportunity, Team Ninja :(. I say this because you could unlock Trish and Vergil as playable characters in DMC 2 & 3, respectively.\nFurthermore I find it disappointing that the devleopper resorted to over-sexualizing their female characters in order to help sell the game, giving them unrealistic exagerrated curves and bounciness that they didn't possess in previous games in the series. I'm all for sexy models but only when they make sense and aren't objectifying.\nFinally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the game's intrinsic difficulty: the game is HARD (especially on the 2nd default difficulty available at the start) and will kick your ♥♥♥♥ and challenge you to play better, which I loved. But if you're the type of person who shies away from demanding games that test your reflexes and coordination then you may want to try the easier setting yet still expect to struggle.\n\n8.25/10","November 30, 2014","true","42.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It may not be as revolutionary but it is an improvement in almost every aspect. The biggest complaint about it is the backtracking that takes place during most of the second half of the game. This is a little overblown though, as the playable character for that part has a different fighting style and the environments have also changed quite a bit. Then again, and while there is a variety of bosses, you will have to fight them again and again which ends up being little bit too much. The PC version of DMC4 is better than the console versions, unlike the troubled port of DMC3. The performance is great and the graphics are nice but not outstanding. The soundtrack takes after DMC3, so it may not be entirely to your liking but even then it shouldn't bother. The plot is passable, it has a few surprises, some funny moments and many well choreographed cut-scenes. Just make sure you have a gamepad - the game can be played with a keyboard but only if you prefer fighting the controls instead of the enemies.","July 2, 2011","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Quite liked the story in 5 but 4 is king for it's combat system. Skill curve is endless with the amount of possible combinations and playstyles. Wish they did a better job on the story in the single player feature since it is known the developers botched it together with Dante's campaign merely retracing Nero's. No explanation given to Nero and Vergil's relationship and Vergil is sadly absent from the story with the exception of some references to his weapon, Yamato which Nero's powers revolve around since he is rumoured to be Vergil's son.\n\nAll in all, great game.

He brings to the table solid combos, great voice acting, a loveable personality similar to the known and loved, Dante.

A few Fausts? No? Well don't play this mode, because it is extremely rage inducing. Unless, you are of course, good at the game.

Devils NEVER Cry.\n\nDevil May Cry 4 is a style simulator with beat em up elements. You play as Nero, a resurrected Roman Emperor in the body of a teenager with a jacket that has more zippers than a Kingdom Hearts character. Armed with his demon arm, an intensifying revver blade, and cardboard girlfriend, you journey across Narnia to find the Grey Fox.\n\nThe battles evolve as you play. Because of the multiple styles you can use, the game can get pretty immersive. Even in the toughest of situations, your enemies will see that you'll fight until eternity. Sadly, there is no multiplayer like DMC 3 allowed, but if you come with me, we'll stand and fight together against Capcom and their abomination known as DmC: Devil May Cry. Through our strengths, we'll make a better day. Tomorrow we shall never surrender.","February 12, 2013","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The combat is complex and rewarding for those willing to master it. You have to stick with it, though. It has some flaws in its gameplay and story, and some people prefer the third game over this one, but I still believe DMC4 is definitely worth giving a shot. The PC port is done surprisingly well. There are also resources online for those who want to refine their skills.\n\nHALLOWEEN POTENTIAL CANDIDATE: Game has elements of demons and monsters and hell.

Characters, enemies and the enviroments all look great. Devil May Cry 4 is a beautiful game.\n\nThe gameplay is excellent. The battle system is the best in the series and I dare say that no other game has the same deepth and complexity. You have two characters that work completly diffrently but is still balanced and I enjoy them both. (But most I like to play as the badass Dante.)\n\nThe music is great, the challange is perfect, the boss fights are epic.

I love Nero, and contrary to popular belief, no, that is not why that is my name. Devil May Cry 4 offers stunning combat, and although after a while, Nero seems to become bland, he is still a well developed character. He brings to the table solid combos, great voice acting, a loveable personality similar to the known and loved, Dante. The PC port is lots of fun as well, featuring a PC exclusive mode, Legendary Dark Knight, with rediculous waves of enemies. Ever wanted to fight a ton of Bianco Angelos? No? How about two Blitz's? A few Fausts? No? Well don't play this mode, because it is extremely rage inducing. Unless, you are of course, good at the game. As for Dante, well, I could go on for hours about his near impossible to learn array techniques and mind blowing combos, but it would be easier for you to just look some stuff up on YouTube.

Definately worth the price.\n\n\nThe music is generally good, the fighting music doesn't get old that fast (which I thought it would) and despite hearing it dozens of times throughout a level I kind of like it. Hell even the music in the menus is good. 9/10 (could be more variety but still awesome).\n\nThe graphics are good as well, I noticed nothing in particular that was that bad. 10/10\n\nThe gameplay is pretty solid, you have guns that do nothing in terms of damage but at least you have something to do while the enemy is trying to get at you from a distance to shut them down. The sword combos feel a little clunky sometimes and dont always register the move i pushed in which is a little annoying but nothing gamebreaking. Some enemies have cool extra animations when you kill them a certain way too.\n\nThe problem with this game? The Camera and sometimes the targeting system. The camera is awful througout most of this game as it locks your view sometimes and makes some attacks come out of nowhere, this is really something that almost broke the game for me the first 30 minutes or so and only my love for the combat made me push on. The targeting is derived somewhat from the Z-targeting of the Zelda series which is an argument in itself, not a fan personally but hey, if you liked the combat in Zelda, you are going to love this game. 4/10 with the camera, it's awful but the game carries it.\n\nThe story is really wierd and good. Most characters aren't acting human, just badass. This annoyed me to some extent but since this game is really over the top in all cases it kind of grew on me. It's so bad it's good. I laughed on multiple occasions at the quirky dialogue and the illogical statements of many of the characters. Dante is hands down the best character because he simply doesn't give a f*ck and just enjoys the show. The boss killings with Dante are ten times better too, just play the game and you'll know what I mean. 10/10, it doesn't get any more tacky and cool than this.\n\nAlthough it should be said that this is probably one of the most gender insensitive games I have played, all the girls that actually do anything (that would be like one of them) dress like hookers. Neros girlfriend did eventually talk without screaming "Nero" and thats a step forward I guess. Not that this doesn't fit the title with its tacky characters (especially Dante) it just doesn't sit right with me that all women need to spot cleavage in a game this awesome. So like 4/10 on gender eq in this game.\n\nTo summerize it is a really good game despite the bad camera and the wierd characters. It's a game full of badasses that a teenager would look up to as cool guys and any person over 20 can have a good laugh at because of the over the top style.\n\n8/10 as a whole, the game is awesome but has some flaws.\n","May 17, 2015","true","25.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It may not be as revolutionary but it is an improvement in almost every aspect. The biggest complaint about it is the backtracking that takes place during most of the second half of the game. This is a little overblown though, as the playable character for that part has a different fighting style and the environments have also changed quite a bit. Then again, and while there is a variety of bosses, you will have to fight them again and again which ends up being little bit too much. The PC version of DMC4 is better than the console versions, unlike the troubled port of DMC3. The performance is great and the graphics are nice but not outstanding. The soundtrack takes after DMC3, so it may not be entirely to your liking but even then it shouldn't bother. The plot is passable, it has a few surprises, some funny moments and many well choreographed cut-scenes. Just make sure you have a gamepad - the game can be played with a keyboard but only if you prefer fighting the controls instead of the enemies.","July 2, 2011","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphics are alright and music somehow fits the environments while you go through the story.\n\nIf you liked the previous games, you will probably like this one (ignoring Nero, of course) and I will recommend it for you, otherwise it will be a good way to pass on time whenever you are bored and make sure to pick it up when is on sale...","July 3, 2015","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now in theory you can play this game with Kb, but in theory communism is a good idea. It does not use the mouse. Let that sink in for a moment. Who thought that this was a good idea? I see no reason whatsoever why gun attack and sword attack should'nt be mouse 1 and 2. Now the keybinds which are by default rather questionable (For example jump being on  k feels counterintiutive eventhough it does make some sense since it is kinda important to press spacebar (target enemy) together with other buttons for combos) are rebindable but still there is no way of incorporating the mouse. Controller is a definitely the way to go here, but for shame making an rpg properly playable on a Pc is not nuclear physics.\n\nBut screw it lets get to the good stuff. On my build Intel g3258 r9 280 8gigs ram DMC4 runs at around 200 fps, and while its graphics are not impressive by that means they are pleasing mostly due to their timeless character.\n\nActual gameplay and story boys. Its cheesy as ♥♥♥♥. And really that's not a bad thing. Everything in this game is over the top from combat to quotes. Some of the stuff( who am i kidding a lot of stuff) that will happen throughout the game is falt out reatrded. But it doesn't come of as cringy because we just roll with it. If everything is ridicilous, nothing is. You are pretty much running around throwing demons at other demons with your demonhand yelling "slamdunk" between al of that. It is hard to describe my sentiments regarding this, but flat out it comes over as awesome. The storyline will probably not present with a lot of upsets but I find the plethora of cutscenes rather enjoyable to watch.\n\nThe combat is really satisfying albeit your sword feels somewhat blunt at times in comparison to say all the cutting you can do in metal gear rising revengeance, nonetheless you have a lot of options on how to engage your enemies be they normal mobs or bosses. Beating stuff up just makes you feel like one BAMF. Now most of the levels are in the end solved by walking forwards and chosing the next door, but yet they do not feal linear. Again my reasoning behind this sentiment is not that easy to explain but it just has to do with the way the world is laid out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ollz4/recommended/45700/","ollz4","ojsm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ollz4/","33 products in account","The Devil May Cry series is probably my favourite series of games. It's fast flowing Hack and Slash action that at times appears deceptively simple, yet every now and then the difficulty jumps and hits you in the face. You have to learn the best combos/ weapons to use. This game is no mindless button masher.\n\nWhilst there are some criticisms about the levels repetitive nature I think that these players are missing the point. The backgrounds, platforming and puzzles are smoke and mirrors - the puzzles and platforms are adequate without being overly testing. The real skill and challenge in the game is mastering the two characters fighting abilities. Pulling off stylish SSS combo's and completing the game on increasingly difficult levels, before facing the Bloody Palace mode.\n\nThis game is very addictive and on a second or third play through far deeper than initially meets the eye. Highly recommended\n","November 6, 2015","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But, in my opinion it's not a GREAT game.  The first devil may cry game I actually played  was the latest reboot (which I thought was friggin awesome!"  I hear a lot of people trash on the newest dmc but relish dmc 4 and other before but I think the reverse is true.  Now, it's a good game; don't get me wrong.\n\nLots of puzzles and god of war type actions more puzzles and less action than god of war( not that that's bad just an observation)  Several different characters in the game, I found them to severely lack in depth.  You will finish the game not knowing much about any of them.  The action is good, graphics are crisp, soundtrack is decent, fun boss battles, decent puzzles.  (Spoiler), you have to play pretty much through all the levels that you beat (all over again) in the 2nd half of the game.\n\nI'd give the game a 7 out of 10, if you want to play a devil may cry game(for the first time) I would buy the latest one.  This one was fun, but it defintely was not exceptional.\n\n","November 10, 2015","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphics are alright and music somehow fits the environments while you go through the story.\n\nIf you liked the previous games, you will probably like this one (ignoring Nero, of course) and I will recommend it for you, otherwise it will be a good way to pass on time whenever you are bored and make sure to pick it up when is on sale...","July 3, 2015","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AyyySBGaming/recommended/45700/","AyyySBGaming","AyyySB","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AyyySBGaming/","240 products in account","UPDATE:\nThere is a Special Edition of the game available for purchase. It does not add too much to the PC version, however I reccomend picking that up if you have: A) Not played the game or B) Only played the 360 or PS3 versions of the game as there are a lot more modes and characters. If you have played the PC version, the only difference is the slight graphical upgrade and the new characters. Otherwise, there isn't that much of a difference between the two. It is not a MASSIVE upgrade compared to Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin, however it is worth buying if you haven't already purchased the PC version of DMC4, which I would imagine you haven't if you are reading this review.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nThe game is absolutely amazing. This is definitely a Devil May Cry game. If you enjoyed 1 and 3, you will like this one just as much. Even if you didn't enjoy the other DMC games, you should still give this a try, whether it be because of the games being too hard, the simple control scheme, the fixed camera or the backtracking, this game improves on all of those making it a good game to start with or play even if you didn't enjoy the classic DMC games.\n\nFor those who haven't played a DMC game, they are hardcore action games notorious for their difficulty. You fight demons throughout the whole games and you also fight bosses and solve puzzles. The combat is very solid, responsive, satisfying and is also very challenging to master. However being able to master the games mechanics will cause some absolutely beautiful combos and moves that your character will do which will look awesome. The games are also known for playing heavy metal music during the fight scenes and also some fairly irritating backtracking, which thankfully, has been toned down a lot in this game.\n\nThe PC port is okay. The game works fairly well with keyboard and mouse (despite lack of camera control with the mouse) but the game works better with a controller. Not just because the mouse control doesn't work, but because games from this genre are just better off being played with a controller. The PC version doesn't include any overintensive features so it is also very easy to run on any machine with a high frame rate. While not the best looking game in the world, it still has enough PC specific features. There is also a Directx 10 mode. However, at least for me, this seemed to make the game a bit more unstable causing it to crash more. There also didn't appear to be that much of a difference between DX9 and DX10 modes. The PC version also has a mode which was not included on the PS3 and 360 versions due to power restraints - Legendary dark knight mode which spawns way more enemies on screen. This makes the game a lot more frantic and enjoyable and could maybe also appeal to fans of the Dynasty Warriors franchise. (Update - This mode is also included in the Special Edition of the game and may also be included on the console versions of the Special Edition)\n\nThe game fixes a lot of problems that the original games have and makes the combat a lot better. It is  a little slow paced and clunky at first and the game is by no means as brutally challenging as DMC1 and 3, but it is still good. Also, your first playthrough may take you some time as you do have a few annoying puzzle sections and a few moments where you may be unsure of where to go, however it is all easy to remember so your second playthrough will be a breeze (in terms of the travelling).\n\nHowever, the game still has it's problems. The level design is a bit weak. The second half of the game is just all of the levels you have played through in reverse with no puzzles included. You even replay the same bosses but in reverse order. Also, for 2/3rds of the game you don't play as Dante. You play as Dante for the second half of the game and only the second half unfortunately. You cannot go back to previous levels and play as Dante which is dissapointing. However it does make the game much more enjoyable when Dante is finally playable. That may sound annoying for die-hard fans of DMC, however Nero, Dante's replacement is still fun to use, even though he feels a little slow and basic at first.\n\nEven though the level design is a little weak, that does not by any means the game is not fun to replay. It is just as fun to replay as the 3rd game. As for difficulty, easy mode is like Devil May Cry 2, however Dante must die (very hard) mode is comparable to Devil May Cry 3 on harder difficulties which, in my opinion, is spot on how they should have done the difficulty. I like this because experts get their challenge, however the game is also noob friendly. This DMC game is a good one to start with, actually as it is not so forgiving. The combat isn't amazing at first, but once you start unlocking upgrades and slowly get better, the combat begins to get amazing.\n\nOverall, DMC4 is a brilliant and worthwhile entry to the series. Despite not playing as Dante, the core is still DMC. Some could argue the combat is not as good as DMC3, however in some ways 4 is more enjoyable as it is not so brutally hard. It also does not include as much backtracking or mapless wandering around like in 3. Even if you didn't like DMC 1 or 3, you should still give this one a whirl as it might be more your thing in terms of difficulty, mechanics and level design. If you are a hardcore DMC fan, you should also give this a go, but don't expect it to be too much better than the original games.","July 21, 2015","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
