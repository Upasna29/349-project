The game itself is simple enough. Reminds me of Knuckles from high school. Has trading cards, but I only got about 10 minutes of entertainment out of it.

Not bad, but it needs more music.\nNeeds something to keep you playing, maybe unlockable coins.\nNeeds leaderboards (Wins, Losses, Goals)\n\nOverall:\nCan't complain, especially for the price.","April 20","true","0.4"," 55 of 183 people (30%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","30","55","183","12","19"
