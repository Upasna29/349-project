I also trusted the developers and had faith in the project. But over the years I just realized that there is nothing to get here apart from empty promises.\n\nWhy is Survarium such a terrible project?\n\n1. The development is extremly slowFrom the initial concept there is not much left. The developers keep focusing on just making money and adding more and more content people are willing to pay for, instead of actually developing what they promised. It had a generic PvP with some RPG elements when I started playing and until this point there is not much more to see in the game. Sure, it has a bit more content in form of items, maps and perks, but that's about it. The development is not much of a development.\nThe "open world" was promised 2 years ago, then it has been promised the next year and now it is promised for this year again. Judging from the slow development, I doubt it will make it into the game anytime soon.\nWhat I noticed during the development is that VG seems to have absolutely no clue what they are doing and just implement random stuff which makes absolutely no sense.\nIn my entire life, I have never seen such an unorganized developer. They absolutely have no clear plan for this project and just implement random stuff that they are thinking of, just to remove obviously stupid ideas later again, once everybody can see how stupid they actually are.\n\n2. The engine is awfulThe game is crashing almost every match and everytime you think it stopped and the devs fixed it, it starts crashing in the next patch all over again. It doesn't seem they are actually fixing their terrible engine, but just gluing crash spots together.\nThere are ridiculous FPS drops during the matches from sounds and graphics. My 120 fps feel like 40 and during the mentioned drops the shown 70 fps feel like 5. I am not exaggerating. And VG is not able to fix that since the beginning of the testing.\nSame goes for the server engine - the netcode: Everything is lagging and teleporting back and forth, even with low ping. Sometimes you play like a beast and kill people left and right, sometimes you get killed before you even get a chance to see or shoot an enemy. And most of the time players just don't take damage even though you get hit and got-shot markers and see blood coming out of the body. Every patch they seem to fix some of these sync issues according to the changelog, but nothing ever changes. Even the very old games like Counter-Strike and Unreal Tournament back in their earliest days had better working servers with proper hit detection.\n\n3. There are no innovationsThe game just feels like a generic PvP shooter like CoD. They didn't even try to built something special or unique and it seems they want to compete with games like that, even though most of their fanbase comes from STALKER.\nI mean, hitmarkers in a game that is focused on emersion? Playing 8v8 on very small maps where all you can do is run and gun? Have no possibilities for special movements like proning, rolling and climbing? What a joke. There is like no reason to actually play this game, since there are way better alternatives for that.\n\n4. The game is turning into p2wLast patch it was the PP-19 and the fully modded AK12. This patch it's the fully modded PKP. Over the course of one patch, there is no way you could get those weapons by playing regularly. The PP-19 is too rare of a drop and modding a weapon out is only efficient if you use Premium currency. That is why the players are starting to feel that they have to spend money to compete optimally with other players. So the monetizing concept in Survarium encourages to pay money to get an advantage over others and is clearly pay-to-win. And the features of having exclusive Premium weapons, crafting advantages and additional loadouts are all part of that pay-to-win concept.\nVG claiming otherwise makes me laugh everytime.\n\n5. Barely any communication from the developersIssues from users are rarely addressed. Good suggestions to improve the game are never implemented. The devs seem to have their own vision of a terrible game and prefer adding more and more stupid and useless "features", which most of the time are just there to pull the money out of the players' pockets.\nThe developers are busy writing about their great plans and how awesome the game will be when it is done, instead of telling its' players what they are working on currently to get feedback before they implement their stupid ideas. Mostly it's because they are not actually working towards their greater aims, but just add useless cashgrab "features".\nThere has been a lot of constructive criticism in the forums and many suggestions how to fix the current game, but instead of listening to it, VG has the often seen "haters gonna hate" attitude and keeps ruining the game. And they don't even bother to inform their players what is going on behind the scenes, even though they call this game a Beta.\nEven the changelog from patches is never complete. About half of the changes are missing and you have to find out yourself what is different. Even simple things like weapon stats are partly left out.\n\n6. Balance does not existNot between players, not between teams and certainly not between weapons. The balance is just one big joke.\nThis game can potentially put 8 level 100 supermen with lvl 15 gear up against 8 naked lvl 1 newbies.\nAnd every patch they introduce a new overpowered weapon that is superior to every other weapon, just so paying users can buy and craft them perfectly, while regular users can only dream of achieving that over the time of one patch, until the next overpowered weapon is released and they have a disadvantage again. Here again: clearly pay-to-win. Everybody who doesn't see the paying advantage through such a system is straight out blind.\n\nSummarized VG is a joke and Survarium is a lie. Don't waste your time here like I did. This game will never be good.","April 2, 2015","false","145.7"," 1,796 of 2,131 people (84%) found this review helpful 115 people found this review funny","84","796","2","115","89"

I was a decent player but not the best. Due to this game's whining community that meant I got accused of hacking constantly but never really thought much of it of course. Then on the 14th july they permabanned me for 'forbidden software' presumably because of repeated accusations. I've never cheated in this or any multiplayer game and frequently play with clan members all of whom have never cheated. We wouldnt even know how to. I have no forbidden ro even slightly suspect software. So it must be a mistake right? Try to contact an admin but they've banned me from their forum and website with no means of getting in touch. I've sent support tickets and emails and still recieved no reply. I've been a fan of these guys work for over a decade, yet they cant give me five damn minutes of their time to check im not cheating and give me back 100s of hours of gametime. Disgusting customer service. So long story short if you get this game and sink a few dozen hours in dont get too good. Cause the audience or devs might decide theyve had enough.

I played the closed beta, and somehow in the three months of me not touching this game everything has gone to complete ♥♥♥♥.\n\n"Survarium is a post-apocalyptic online FPS game. If you are looking for a shooter where skills matter, look no further! The opposing players, deadly anomalies and traps will never stop you on the way to victory, right? Then start playing now for free! " is what this game has for it's introduction on the store page. Nothing in this is true. Skill does not matter, your proximity to Communist Russia determines if you can hit anything or not. The opposing players are generally hackers, or bigotted fascists. The deadly anomalies are only deadly because they glitch out and cut off entire sections of the maps and will kill you the second you walk into them. This game isn't free either, if you dont have a fat wallet expect to die over and over again to people that shelled out money for guns with mods (that can't be obtained in anyway what so ever by free player) whom also have armor that takes more bullets than ♥♥♥♥ing Ironman.\n\nBullets hit nothing, your armor does nothing. Enemies one hit you, and can take 10-20 rounds. I like to snipe, it is what I've done in most FPSs ever. I had someone with p2w armor and guns take 3 headshots and 2 torso shots from the Remington, not die, not bleed to death, able to wheel around, instantly pin-point my location on the map (IN HEAVY COVER AND CONCEALMENT) and kill me in one hit with an AK-12, from around 350m. This game is bad, this dev is bad, this game is so god damn bad I'm actually infuriated right now. You should in no way what so ever support this game, don't download it, dont take it for a test drive, dont pay any money for it.\n\nLet this game and dev die the terrible, horrible, irradiated death they deserve because this game is a ♥♥♥♥ing insult to the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. community, and any person that considers themself a gamer.","May 3, 2015","false","3.4"," 361 of 431 people (84%) found this review helpful 81 people found this review funny","84","361","431","81","7"

It has such massive potential.\n\nPros:\n\n1) Sound is amazing. Play with a good headset and you will be able to hear every footstep and gunshot in beautiful deafening glory. Their sound guy deserves a raise.\n\n2) Bullets hurt. No shrugging off 7.62 rounds like BBs. When you get hit you feel it. Head shot auto-kills, sniper rifles kill with torso shots, unless your carrying heavy armor.\n\n3) Bleeding. When you get shot you tend to bleed, and left untended you will bleed out and die, so if you just winged a soldier as he ran in a building he might fall over dead in a few seconds. Bad part is you medkits to deal with it and they are one use and instant apply. Beginning you will not even know how to use it. When you do, it disappears and then next scratch and you're doomed. There are no ways to get more in game, until you die. Would like to see a medkit be infinity use but you have to hide and spend a several seconds bandaging and or tourniquet. They are so mandatory you will never get to equip any other items, like grenades.\n\n4) Brings back tactics like sneaking and teamwork. At the moment no one works as a team, but if you get a group and do you can seriously dominate. Communication is god. Plenty of cover and concealment for the like minded sniper.\n\n5) Leveling system is awesome idea and can help you specialize your play style, but still needs more work.\n\nCons:\n\n1) Team Killing Rampant-There is currently no puishment for Team Killing and it happens alot. Nothing you can do about it. Vostek says to take a screen shot and then go to support page and submit evidence, except you can't. Page wont open, can't write a support ticket either, says I dont have permission.\n\n2) Massive Unbalancing, this is one of the most unbalanced games I've ever played. SMG's do everything better than everything else. Get in a game 95% of players using one. Sniper Rifles have no scopes or anything terrible rechambering, slow you down, small mags, and server side glitched will mean you miss alot of shots due to everyone being Nightcrawler all over the map, so its like playing the game on hard mode.\n\n3) Hit Registration is awful often disregarding single shots so sorry again, snipers you will often shoot right through your target while he blows you away with 30 well aimed non-scattering shots. Glitches a plenty fall through map, people teleporting, and invisible players.\n\n4) No safe spawn point. The entire map is open for everyone so if you sneak around the lines, which is easy due to map size and cover, you can just sit in their spawn and kill them as they spawn. This one I can guarentee will happen in every game.\n\n5) No prone. In Future Russia laying on the ground is prohibited, which really hurts snipers, causing you to stand still like a big dumb target.\n\n6) Matchmaking is broken, only game mode you can get into is TDM and you will get matched with players from all tiers of play, so your first game will proabably be against god-tier players with heavy armor and LMG's and the worlds more accurate SMG's ever made. Using weapons that you can no longer attain due to changes in the game. So they will always have an edge over you.\n\n7) In game store. This game has an In game store, which is perfectly fine for a F2P game, except that it is not finished and they say they can't even get small things like the damn "Stars and Stripes" in the game (While they have like 30-40 others and their coat of arms, including even a Atlas has never heard of), but you bet they want you to spend your money on it. Also leveling up without "Premium" is awful. I got no good drops after games, got a few days premium to see the difference, and I got like 10 weapons in one day. You will almost never see one without it.\n\nIn this state I cannot recommend this game. That being said, I would love to come back and play this game if they ever fix it. In it's current state it's really a open alpha, with a In Game Store. I do not recommend supporting these shady business tactics in Video Games. Vostek Games please fix yourself please.\n\nUpcoming Edit:\nI wrote this a while ago and I stand by what I wrote. I had no idea people were commenting on my review. A few people seem to think I'm just hating on this game. After 60 hrs its safe to say I am invested in this game, but I side with players not companies. I am aware its early access, it literally says so at the top of the review and I said in its current state, I do plan on coming back to review it once it gets farther along. I tried to play it a few weeks back and I couldnt get into a game. After like 20 min of searching. I posted no lies, just my honest experience with the game. I really want this game to be good, but at that moment it wasn't. Hopefully it'll finish soon and it will be awesome, until then add a ♥♥♥♥ing prone button. Add yes guns were unbalanced at the time I wrote this I strolled the forums and it was the biggest complaint. I bet they fixed it by now, I hope so. I'll check it out again after finals and write a edit. Also there was no spawn protection I died like 6 times in a row before I even could move, I spent every game sneaking around the map and spawn camping people because its the fastest way to win. They need to make a safe spawn restricted zone. Like old battlefield games. It was just sloppy work, this isnt a new problem. Its one of the biggest complaints people have in CoD too.","April 9, 2015","false","60.2"," 353 of 429 people (82%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","82","353","429","19","9"

I'm not even joking!!!\n\nTo be fair, the game does have some positive traits:\n\n- it's free\n- plenty of different weapons and gear to choose from and customise - if you have the patience to grind for it, of course\n- devs have already held several community events with some great prizes for everyone\n- the gameplay is fast and easy, this is more of a twitch shooter than a simulator\n- you can freely switch between regional servers without losing your progress\n- the graphics are nice and the audio production is excellent\n- the game looks a lot like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and is developed by some of the same devs\n- if you're really lucky, you can get some nice weapons and gear from loot drops after a match\n\nSummary:\n\nFor every step forward, the devs take two steps back. They can fix one thing, but break another and add some feature which the community didn't ask for and doesn't want. They've promised a lot, but have so far failed to deliver even half of what they promised to deliver by this time. Most of the veterans have lost hope for this game and moved on a while ago.

Support is terrible unless you rant on the forums/social media. It's a fun game for a few matches but ultimately it falls short on many of the promises that were made to the community. There's no real team balance, there's cheaters on every corner (much like other games) but the response to them is poor and there still is no 'freeplay' exploration mode.

There’s quite a lot of things I do have to say about this game, but before I’ll go into things that motivate my final opinion - I’d like to state a few things loud and clear first.\n\nThere’s a lot of people claiming this game it’s ridden through with cheaters and haxers. It is both true and not. There are cheaters and haxers in this game, there’s no denial to that. But there also is a huge amount of veteran players that have high level characters, full orange gear with great mods and countless hours spent in this game just as I have. And believe me, there’s a huge number of them more skilled than I’m, and we all are just as paranoid about haxers and cheaters as many new players are. The problem is, we know this game through and through. We have tactics, gear and perks to make certain things work. We play (most of us I guess, btw that’s a tip for all the new players out there) on headphones and we’re sensitive to the certain sounds and that’s why we manage to turn around and shoot others in the head as they creep on us. We’ve been playing for long in our dwindling community where the skill cap was going only higher, thus we know how to play and how to play well. That’s the reality, thus not all the talk about haxers and cheaters you might see or read about it’s true. But it isn’t false either, as the .esp users are out there. And there’s even more of them now with the arrival of 0.40 than before. Which is obviously sad and upsetting even more now that the developers refuse to deliver us any kind of anti-cheat system and that cheaters are allowed to keep on playing the game with new accounts. Anyway, a lots of players you see and would want to call a haxer in the moment of rage - aren’t the ones. That’s how things are in survarium, as that’s the game where skill pays off way more than in other games.\n\nHaving this point out of the way, lets move on to what survarium is, and why I have such opinion on it.\n\nSurvarium is a great game in it’s own way. Even now, with dumbed down (or “cod’ed”) guns, the gunplay is still crisp and satisfying more often than not. And full of epic actions and bitter moments. The level u can customize your character is good, you can equip different pieces of armor and mix them all together to create your nicely looking avatar. You’re not tied to the levels and don’t have to use certain stuff to remain effective in the match, as long as you have the skills to make things work. The gear though, obviously can influence your performance, as it will offer you a greater protection or let you dish out more damage in a short time when it comes to the guns. In fact, if there’s something that defines your performance would be obviously your skill level and the gun you use, other than that - you can play the top tier matches just in a sweater without anything and still kick ♥♥♥ if you’re good enough. And with arrival of 0.40, you can further customize your character by customizing your weapons, not just the gear you wear and it’s looks. Making certain guns viable way beyond the tier they’ve been assigned to.\n\nOther than that, that’s not the Stalker game. it does have some feel of it, but Survarium tries to be more or less independent of the Stalker and it’s legacy. In some way it’s a good thing, but it means not everyone will like it. Sadly if you’re here for the world module (freeplay), I’d say you’d rather forget it. I was waiting for it myself but seeing the progress of the game over the last year and so, I’m rather sceptic about will it ever gonna come to life in a playable form. Just nobody can tell will it ever gonna be delivered at this point.\n\nBut moving to the bad things, lets start listing those. I’m going to repeat the problem of cheaters and haxers here as it’s, as I’ve see it, one of the crucial problems of the game right now really. And sadly the developers do refuse to implement any kind of system that would be eliminating those on the spot, instead they let them play for a week or two, while these accounts will get reported numerous times, which will bring the spyglass on them and reveal the kind of cheats that are being used on these accounts. And finally ending in their ban, but the haxers aren’t locked out from the game completely sadly. They can make the new account, and do it again.\n\nFurthermore, the netcode of this game... It’s one huge mess, and servers aren’t the best either. I’m not even talking about their problems coming from overcrowding them by the number of players that gave up on the title in wait for the patch 0.40 and are back playing again. I talk about that some (usually CIS server) players abuse the delays and pings no matter the server, making it impossible to play competitively as they won’t register hits, soak them like a sponge, and then just blast you off the face of the planet with ease. They’ll also cut u down on the corners as they’ll literally gonna be able to walk up to u and empty half of the mag before you’ll even see them.. It’s very annoying, especially when you play on your “local” cluster and yet they still have better delays and everything. Netcode of survarium is just bad outright awful when it acts up. And it does quite a lot of times sadly.\n\nAt last, the hugely awaited patch 0.40. It is a huge eye opener to me, as I find it rushed, unpolished and full of illogical stuff in. I was hyped about it, but upon laying my eyes on the changes, I’ve realized that the hype train for me it’s over. It’s poorly done, slaped up quickly just to get some interest back to the game - that’s how i see it. Don’t take me wrong, it isn’t outright bad awful neither it’s not that I do not enjoy it in general. But it is a huge mess, to say the least. There’s a lot of stuff I could start ranting about it. For example literally everything gets a silencer now. Thus in bigger perspective expect the SILENCOVARIUM not survarium. The players without those will be punished heavily for not having one, in fact they already are. Further, the lots of upgrades are outright awful, unlogical and all of them were pretty much slapped on everything. There should be a diversity, definite marker of roles for each class. Instead no matter what u have, just get it a silencer that’s all that matters. Going further, the upgrades itself. For example the scopes. People were waiting for cobra’s and different pso’s for the warsaw-pact weaponry. Instead they get nothing of it really. It’s even worse on some of the western guns, where x4 scope is being “played” by a high powered (with variable magnify) sniper scope. Yeah, that’s the model u get on your gun! It’s RIDICULOUS and that’s just one of very long list of things like that sadly…\n\nThere is a chance that with time things will improve. That the new renderer that’s promised will greatly increase the performance of this game. That developers will get their head around and fix some of the modules, and that they’ll add some new ones to replace or complete up the existing ones. But those are just hopes for me. I was waiting for quite a few things (including this patch) for over a year now, and VG never delivers neither never listen to their community. Hence why I give this game a thumbs down now. It have still some glimpse of a chance to become a great game, but I wouldn’t have my hopes up for that. Honest.\n","March 1","false","538.1"," 290 of 374 people (78%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","78","290","374","30","21"

This game is not pay to win by anymeans. The weapons you unlock early on many higher level people use. Its seems most F2P games get a bad rap, this one is set up quite well. Paying for premium will get you to level faster, but you will play with people your level. so it balances out.\n\nThis review is subject to change.\n\nPros:\n\n-Dripping with atmosphear\n-Fast leveling (try to play research and collection. They provide the most experence)\n-Cheap Premium (if that is your thing. By with gold, its cheaper and will go further)\n-Vast array of weapons, ammo types, armor, and items to use.\n-Fun fast paced gameplay\n-Fantastic non-linear maps\n-P2W element is non existant\n\nCons:\n-Few gamemodes\n-long wait times for gamemodes other than tdm\n-Premium (purchased currancy)\n-High system requirements\n-Still have to wait for future content\n-later levels can feel gindy\n\nNotes:\n\nI loved the STALKER series. So much I made the well known mod series SRAP for all three games.\nWith that I am probably a bit bias. I love the atmostphere that Vostok has created with this game so far. The last two years of development has gone into the engine and developing some of the earliest content. I have to say they have done a good job so far.\nIt seems now they are ramping things up. With the release on steam they are begining to add features and more maps to play on. As well as preparing us for the new gamemode known as "Free Play". Basicly Free Play is going to be an openworld survival mode. It is predicted to be out later this year, 2015, and will be free to play for all! So I am very excited for that.\n\n\nGameplay is... unique. Almost a blend of arma's movement, CoD fast play, and Stalker's RPG elements. Its very good! Its quite easy to get a lot of good equiptment fast, and there is a lot to pick from. There is more than one way to get to an objective. Maps are very well done and beautiful.\nSadly at this time. we are limited on maps and gamemodes. They are in development and should be avalible soon.\nThe latter two gamemodes are... hard to find at times. mostly due to people not realizing they are unchecked in the options below the play button. Being F2P there is premuim subcriptions and Premium curancy (gold). If you had to pay for anything. Buy some gold then use it a little at a time to pay for your premium account. Its way cheaper and more of a pay per play basis. You will save money, in turn level up a lot faster. I only put $15 into this game and I am level 30 and have unlocked tere 7.\n\n\nAll in all this is a fantastic game that has a lot of potential for the future. Expecially with free play mode coming up.\n","April 19, 2015","true","308.0"," 148 of 192 people (77%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","77","148","192","20","28"

After release though and selling people "founders packages" they then went on to make a completely different game.\n\nAfter buying the most unstable NA server ever and removing the lighting system in exchange for baked in lighting they decide to start adding killcams, radars, removing grass, buffing automatics, increasing player move speed, and nerfing single shot weapons effectively turning this game into a lower quality CoD clone except every level is now the Pripyat level from CoDMW.\n\nGame is also infested with hackers who the devs have given up on banning because they always just create a new account for free. Matchmaking has never been fixed even though it routinely puts players having their first game in games with players with endgame resources and level progressions. Then promised features like freeplay have been put on indefinite hold with no progress reports being shown despite being planned for open testing over 8 months ago.\n\nIf you try to complain like a majority of the forum community did as shown in numerous polls about any of it the devs will just make an interview video in the Russian language only and let forum users translate it to other forum users so they can see the devs openly say they do not consider the forums at all when making changes, only the amount of players as representative of the quality of their product.\n\nDo not waste your money on this game. This is their flagship title and if that is anything to go on they won't be around to make games much longer.

The gameplay is addictive. Lots of stuff to unlock. I dare to say, "fun" grinding. After each round you get some sort of loot in your Tier (your level)\n\n2. Big and tight maps with alot of hiding spots. Love the grass and the way they have made it look.\n\n3. Not pay to win. Everything in the game is obtainable.

If you are Tier 3 you will meet tier 6, heck i have mett tier 8 on tier 3... Whats the point with tiers then?\n\n5. Unballanced weapons as fudge. Everyone uses the same weapons in the toptier.

MMO stands for Massive interactions in a game envrionment (not just a chat room or lobby).\n\n- matchmaking is broken.\n\n"ELO" doesn't mean much. it just greedily throws you immidiately to the first match it can throw you to regardless of the opposition or teammates' skill levels.\n\nteams are rarely balanced, which turns a lot of matches onesided and spawn camps. map design sometimes is so imbalanced, that spawn campers have an unfair advantage one cannot break out and beat (due to angles, or where one must push to even get an angle on a dude while opening himself up for the other spawn campers]).\n\n- lack of content is covered up by a SERIOUS grind to unlock new content.\n\n- EU servers exist, and are working according to devs/mods, but in reality, and despite being on the EU region and not CIS, you're constantly connecting to CIS servers and playing with horrible pings against russian players who are warping around on your screen and instagibbing you on sight.\n\n- bleeding system..\n\nis a brutally random and unfair way of dying, even if you did something amazing before you bled to death.\n\nprovides you with kills you didn't earn. nothing you wanna see in a competitive fps.\n\nforces you to use a certain type of consumable (medkits to stop bleeding) which hurts versatility and different playstyles.\n\nkills the momentum one can gain by pushing / playing the objective. forces to make stops and heal while the enemy can regain pressure on a lane cause the spawn system allows him to respawn quickly and sprint back in with full health. the maps are so small that it happens constantly.\n\nis not explained about in the tutorial, yet it is very common a player at a low rank match will die to it.","April 2, 2015","false","2.5"," 286 of 424 people (67%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","67","286","424","21","30"

Many bugs/glitches that users are asking to fix for over half a year, and they still don't. Instead they do a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ update with swappable face for your character (4 faces that look almost exactly like each other) and other crap like that.\n\nThere is a big lag issue because of the servers and the game's performances, which they tried to fix but failes somehow.\n\nThis game is partially pay to win: you have to pay in order to get the best gear / weapons, level up faster and get more silver to buy random stuff. If you play like me without premium it will take you probably more than 200 hours to reach level 10 fully in gear, and even more to max your skill level ingame.\nYou will also need gold (premium currency) to have 100% chance of upgrading your stuff (I wrote more on this below), you will need gold to change your character face or nickname, gold to find more staches after the game, and gold to have no waiting time when you repair your gear/weapons (waiting time is at least 6 hours, sometimes even 24 hours!). This is just stupid... Oh, did I mention  that when you have waiting time you cannot repair ANY gear/weapon for the next hours you need to wait?\n\nThe wait time to find a game is horrible. The fastest it goes to find a match is about 4 minutes. Sometimes you have to wait up to 20 minutes to find a match... Because of that you will almost always have out of 16 players (8 on each team) about 2-5 players afk for a part of the game or the whole game altogether.\n\nThey say they ban hackers and such but you will still be playing with many walhackers, aimbots, ect...\n\nWeapon upgrade is also horrible. You need to spend silver that you win by having kills, but when you try to upgrade your weapon it says you have 50% of failure (which means you will spend your silver for nothing). But actually you have probably only a 80% of failure. I had weapons and gears that took me well over 10 tries to get 1/3 upgrades on it. That is 80K ingame silver! That's just insane...\n\nThe matches aren't fair at all. You will always play with higher ranked players, get lag from people that come to the wrong server, and occasionally you will get an ingame crash... In case you restart your game you will get back ingame, but killed by the ennemy. This happens 1/10 games.\n\nThey implemented killcams recently... But only 1 out of 10 times or more it displays correctly. Mostly you see yourself dead, or you see the beginning of the killcam and halfway through you just see your dead body.\n\nSometimes it even says something like 'waiting for server to load' and lags like HELL.\n\nDevs need to fix this game ASAP, but they probaly will do some more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ update without fixing all the ingame bugs.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis game doesn't offer anything new that other games don't have. Play this game if you have nothing else to do, but if you look for a good shooter, look elsewhere. This game sucks. Want proof? Look at the rating (currently 50% lol), the comments, or just plainly try and play for yourself. But know that you will end with lots of russian players who don't (want to) speak english.","August 30, 2015","false","97.3"," 63 of 77 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","63","77","0","1"

There are tons of people saying this is P2W, but that is not the case. You can easily kill someone with a paid gun with a free gun. In my opinion, the free guns are sometimes better. It comes down to the skill of both you and your opponent.\n\nPros:\nAmazing graphics\nSmooth Gameplay (i can easily maintain 60 fps)\nvery detailed world that I just want to explore\nSo many maps for a CB, i thought at one point that they were randomly generated and that they can't have this many.\nshooting feels really nice\n\nCons:\nNo PVE (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it i want it so bad)\nNot alot of modes (yet)\nNo leaning (Thou minor complaint)\nCan get repetitive gameplay after a while\n\nConclusion:\nSo far this game feels like when I was playing Nosgoth. Amazing world and solid gameplay, but get repetitive and boring. However, while Nosgoth has to continue to follow that formula besides add more characters and maps, This game can expand into the PVE. As a shooter currently, they can only add more maps and guns and equipment and that gets boring fast. For now, I reccommend playing this is short bursts so you don't get burnt out. Also stop fighting sometimes and enjoy the scenery, they are gorgious.\n\n","April 4, 2015","true","3.9"," 133 of 187 people (71%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","71","133","187","12","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/novapolice/recommended/355840/","novapolice","NovaPolice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/novapolice/","800 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI would like to say that I played a bit of this back in closed beta.\nNot a lot, but it has given me an idea of how far this game has come, and hasn't come.\n\nInventory, Skills, and Customization\n\nThere are a lot of cash-shop elements, like shortcuts to better gear, rolling for the chance to upgrade gear (there are no mods, only stat boosts), additonal drops, instant repairs for gear, cosmetics, a premium account, skipping wait times for fiddling with equipment, the whole nine yards.  It feels like the early equipment is easy enough to get, and it doesn't seem like the bonuses are super-powerful.  But, it still doesn't feel like that helps balance things out.\n\nThere are far more guns, equipment, and items than there used to be, but I feel that a lot of those items aren't useful or interesting looking.  It is nice that you can somewhat customize certain armor items' appearance. Many are tied to the faction system, which mainly serves to slow down your unlocking of stuff.\n\nEquipment is designed for protection from bullets, or for protection from anomalies.  However, armor value is lowered when the enemy is using low leveled guns, many weapons have high AP values, they all have AP ammo, and they generally have high DPS.  So, armor is a suggestion.\n\n"Isolation" armor protects you from anomalies, but those are in side areas/shortcuts, and you can ignore a lot of things by using an oxygen tank. There are apparently artifacts to find, which would be great if you weren't in a tight map with lots of identical men shooting at you.\n\nItems are mainly things like medkits and grenades and traps. One of the few important things armor determine is slots, so you're stuck with one slot/option for a long time. There are also expensive items that give you a boost for one match, but they're aren't worth the price. Healing items are less useful, as they heal over time and you generally die too quick for them.\n\nI think that one of the problems is that things feel unbalanced in general; SMGs dominate the low level games, with the occasional AR or LMG showing up.  Precision weapons, shotguns, and pistols feel quite crappy, with them feeling quite slow, weak, and not much stronger than automatic weapons even in their niche ranges.  Guns have ballistics, but they only really matter for the shotguns, which have the effective range of about a thrown rock or nerf-gun.  Many guns are direct upgrades.\n\nSo, there is not a lot of interesting loadout options, despite the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and FPS/RPG vibes. Get the best SMG or light AR you can, get the better armor with more ammo bags and item slots, get oxygen if you want to run through an anomaly, get frags/beartraps; you're done with top-tier builds.\n\nThis spreads to the new skills; many are tied off by the leveling system (you have leveling, and faction levels that add a lot of grinding), some are unimplemented, and many do incredible things like "you reload guns 8% faster." It favors long term players in minor ways, without really giving you options that affect playstyle.  You get one skill point a level, and leveling is not fast.\n\nThoughts on Gameplay\nYour melee is powerful, but awkward and poorly animated.  While you can be sneaky on some maps, running and gunning is what the most sucessful players do, next to camping in concealed locations.\n\nThere is now a complex wounding system, with elements like bleeding to death, crippled limbs, and environmental hazards.  However, you will often die to two bullets blowing out your chest, so those elements are less important.\n\nThere are also no indicators and not really a sound when a grenade lands nearby, so I hope you're really good at seeing where the small thing landed in dense grass.  You also buy ammo when you use it in matches; it doesn't cost much, but it is still a nusiance like repairs.\n\nYou have 8v8 TDM, CTF, and Domination as your gamemodes, with the Domination one being the most recent.  Servicable, but impaired by balance issues and map design.\n\nGamemodes have been added slowly, and the long promised open-world co-op/PvP looks rather ambitious for what the game has added in the past.  There's not even a "here's a proof of concept with some mutants;" it is not something I would bank on arriving this year.\n\nCTF is improved by the fact that flags are grabbed from a neutral point, and you can steal points from the enemy team by stealing their stockpiled flags.  However, it is not played as often as TDM, despite being the only different mode in this game.\n\nLag is better, but you still get rubberbanding sometimes.  You have no voice chat or quick "radio" binds; you have only text chat, and a lot of silent players.  You don't have servers, you have to wait for the game to shuttle you (and possibly a party) to a match that hasn't started yet.  Waiting times have improved, but they can still be slow (especially for CTF, sometimes for DOM.)\n\nAs someone else mentioned, you can't pick a map (only a mode), and it will often throw in high level players. The only balance is a handicap where high level players do less damage and have less health. This does not help if they have one of the few silenced guns in the game, twice as many rounds as you, or a more accurate version of your gun.\n\nI do like some of the maps, but many are simple, or have simple main areas with complex side routes that are useless compared to the direct side routes that are everywhere.\n\nThe map designs favor ambushing, with accessible side routes that overlook the central portions of the map or go to the enemy spawn.  It is simple to avoid "defended" areas and come around from behind. The lightning quick time-to-kill further emphasizes killing players before they can react.  There is no spawn protection, too.\n\nSound and Graphics\nThe maps can be very pretty, especially their anomalous zones, but much is low res looking (like the shoddy industrial textures).  Some outfits are cool, many are not, and their customization is basic. You have one character model available, the most intensely Generic European FPS Hero I have ever seen.  He is the same one I saw over a year ago, and you will shoot him a lot if you play this.\n\nThe guns actually have pretty kick-♥♥♥ sounds, but they're not well animated or modelled or textured.  My current SMG actually looks like something from Shadow of Chernobyl, quality-wise.  Animations in general aren't so hot.  Actually, there is not a lot of sound besides gunfire and footsteps; there isn't really music, there's no voices, and there is little atmospheric sound.\n\nSo, that is everything that sticks out to me.  The game can be fun in short bursts, but I feel there's not a lot of content, and what they do have needs a lot of polish and rebalancing.  There are promising elements, but it's not like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. (much less a multiplayer version of it.)\n\nIt's a modern, F2P, multiplayer only FPS with arcadey-realistic guns, and a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. like aesthetic.  I would be glad if the game did become something more, but that is what it is now.","April 6, 2015","false","5.3"," 196 of 288 people (68%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","68","196","288","16","8"

I'll start out simple with the pros and cons, but before I start I'd like to state that while I do enjoy this game, I'm going to try to be as objective as possible.\n\nPros:\n-Beautiful atmosphere and aesthetic\n-Game runs decently well, although you will likely notice a significant fps drop when its raining\n-The anomaly mechanic is pretty cool and allows for addition gameplay choices and styles\n-Good diversity of maps with many ways to sneak and flank on most of them, though this is not true of all\n-Devs are active in the community and are always willing to talk (in my experience)\n-Lack of pay to win, as even premium weapons must be unlocked via leveling (though some still complain about it, I haven't noticed it as too much of an issue)\n-Player level balancing is pretty good for the most part, though in the leagues this can change fast as you move higher\n-Ability to customize your clothing with patches and materials, meaning the possibility of better camo with your favourite gear\n\nCons:\n-Gun balance can be dubious in some areas, but nothing too serious for the most part (The Val is a particularly powerful gun, meaning that if you are stuck in a match with a higher tier player sporting one, then you're gunna have a very tough time)\n-Game client and servers can be touchy, but in my experience the worst I've had was a simple bug that crashed my game when joining a match for the first time that day. Still I've heard reports of worse so keep that in mind.\n-Leveling the factions can get grindy, and you can get stuck at a level where enemy players have better gear than you, but you have to fight them to get levels lest you downgrade your gear to get into lower tier matches\n\nNow I would put more cons, but anything else I could think of is subjective or I lack sufficient information, so I'll continue down here. I'll also put points of comment down here as well.\n\nThere's a lack of team cohesion unless you bring friends, this is mitigated slightly by the quick commands the devs put into the game, but the main issue lies in the fact that there's very little reason to work together unless on one of the capture the batteries games. You can't heal teammates if you have medkits or similar items, you can't spot enemies, You're better off loading your guy with ammo and meds, hiding in a bush, and sniping the poor suckers till they find ya.\n\nNow, this is a very subjective con, and many will likely disagree with me here, but I feel like this world lacks danger currently. I don't mean players, I mean the anomalies and environment. They significantly improved on the anomaly mechanic in patch 0.28, where they made them spawn around the map randomly, making the artifact hunter gameplay style much more viable. And while they do provide a huge boost to whoever has them, and do kill you if you lack isolation and stand around them too long without grabbing them or leaving, the devs make this world out to be a living hell almost. The anomalies aren't dangerous enough, they got rid of the fog on some maps that made rebreathers useful. The devs need to make the environment as willing to kill us as the guys on the other team, with acid rain that makes those with low isolation stay under roofs, plants that emit toxins, super storms that reduce visibilty and make it hard to hear.\n\nAll things considered, this game stands on a pinpoint. It has the potential of being a really good game, with the devs promising freeplay, mutants, and more. But there's a lot of problems that could use ironing ou first, stability, framerate drops, and gun/armour balance to name the most pressing ones. The devs seem to be pretty ok and in all honesty the game isn't bad, it's not quite a 7/10 either but I could probably place it at a 5 as it is at the moment average. Some say there's spawning issues with enemies showing up behind you, bullet lag and such. But I'm very sure they're exaggerating.\n\nLike I said, I really hope this game comes through with the promises it has made and cleans itself up, but I tried to stay objective throughout. If I missed any points, I would recommend you to look at other reviews and read the forums, plus you could try the game yourself, I mean it is free after all. But I think I covered the meat and potatoes of this game.\n\nAs it stands, the game is a 5/10 for me. It's average, it has its bugs, and it has potential to become something great. I can recommend it to you, but if you do get the game keep in mind that it is EARLY ACCESS and my experience is not liekly to be the same as yours.","July 21, 2015","true","41.5"," 77 of 103 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","77","103","5","2"

This is extremely disappointing giving the potential this game had.\n\nFor all intents and purposes it is still a generic mediocre shooter. TDM, Capture the Flag and King of The Hill, in a couple of very small and bland maps, 8v8 and that's about it. It's recently added in perks (which give a clear advantage vs new players) and a faction system (just a daily rep grind for slightly better gear, also slow without premium) which is at least something to briefly hold your attention but it doesn't seem to be going anywhere past that.\n\nThe balancing is awful, the matchmaking out right never works, maps are poorly designed and bland and the gameplay model is geared towards rewarding people who pay vs people who play. This was lauded as being an extremely immersive post-apocalyptic MMO and it's turned into a Call of Duty mashed together with World of Tanks. The graphics are average, the sound design is very good, gunplay is not remotely satisfying combined with iffy hit-boxes and obnoxious hit markers appearing constantly makes for a sour experience.\n\nThere are a lot of guns to choose from, nearly all of them being russian based, with a single faction's rewards being western weapons but it's roughly similar to STALKER in variety. One of my biggest gripes with it claiming to be an immersive and realistic shooter, is that 10 different guns all use the same calibre of ammunition, and it is clearly stated as such, but they've all got vastly different damage values. People of a higher rank outright get more armour and have better weapons, and when you start out you have identical calibre weapons that can't touch them.\n\nI, like a lot of people, saw this years ago as trying to lure in STALKER fans, and their website is very in tune with lauding on about how dangerous the "forest" is a long all of the factions, dangers and adventure to be had. The only thing even remotely similar to the STALKER games is the fact that they've added anomalies/artifacts to the maps that kill you when you get close, they contribute absolutely nothing to the flow of the gameplay and are a novelty at best.\n\nPros:\n\n- Great sound design\n- Large variety of weapons and clothing (that requires large amounts of grinding unfortunately)\n- You can reach the main menu without needing to spend any gold.\n\nCons:\n\n- Mediocre graphics\n- Poor gunplay\n- Grind heavy.\n- Clear and major advantages to users who pay over uses who play.\n- No fleshed out story, plot or context. (bar that you're in a dangerous forest filled with radiation and some scavengers)\n- Poor netcode, hit detection and general network instability.\n- Prone to crashing, FPS drops and graphical bugs.\n\nTo echo many others, if you take a look at the timeline we all saw two years ago -\nhttp://survarium.com/sites/default/files/news/survarium-timeline-en.jpg\n\nWe were supposed to have a billy bones basic version of the open world by the end of 2013. I predict at their current rate of progression, we'll probably see it fully released by 2017. Given that this game is very popular in CIS states due to the fact it's F2P and they are a major source of premium currency purchases in similar games, I don't see it dying out or crashing and burning, but it is still a massive disappointment and has turned into a cash cow.","May 5, 2015","false","3.0"," 78 of 105 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","78","105","2","0"

The guns you get to start off with are complete crap.\nThe reason behind that is so you can go and buy the more op guns. The prices are STUPID high.\n\n2.) People use shotguns way too much - way op and they don't make sense sometimes why...\nSeems noobs will be noobs easy kill means instant satisfaction, for when your life sucks I guess thats the best you can get.\n\n3.) The hit detection is crap, you can start shooting someone, and all of a sudden they turn to you and you end up dead.\n"SERIOUSLY!?, I guess the first rounds where just warning shots" Dumb...\n\n4.) The prices on this game are obscenely high. $150 something for DLC... COD DLC would make you happier... EA wouldn't stoop that low... Or would they?\n\nI seen people play one game and pretty much say "F**k this". I don't blame them in the least bit. To get good guns you have to grind a sh*t load, but for the frustration involved not worth it.\n\nIf devs have to wonder why their game has such a low pop than other F2P games well those are your reasons. Since the game has such low pop you will probably will be waiting roughly 5-10 mins, sometimes more just to get in game.\n\nThis game COULD be fun if they fixed all of the above. Also, even if it was worth to buy stuff on this game, you can't pay through steam, you have to buy it from their website. I'll pass on that.\n\nI might play it from time to time, but not because I enjoy it, but because my friend plays it, and I like playing with friends.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/welcometosystonia/recommended/355840/","welcometosystonia","Systematic Gone Wild","http://steamcommunity.com/id/welcometosystonia/","194 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA game that promises to let you play in the deadly radiation, then shoves it into the back of the shelf in favor of a boring arena shooter.\n\nWhere's free roam mode?!\n\nEdit: So it appears that the saltening is happening, and this little review is being baraged criticising this review and trying to defend a game. I'd be ok with that if you used factual evidence instead of shooting off on your emotions, so it looks like I'm going to have to go into further detail.\n\nFirstly. Early Access is not an excuse to defend a game. The game is a product that is readily available on the steam store and one in which you can spend money in micro transactions. It shouldn't be given lenience just because it has an early access tag slapped on it. It should be judged based on the product it is now, which is what I've done. Maybe I'll come back to the game when it's finished and change this review based on the changes.\n\nNow lets focus on the 2 main points I made in the review. Forgetting of course that the mentioning of free roam was a light hearted stab which people took way too seriously. Lets talk about the combat and anomalies.\n\nThe combat is horrible. Team Death Match and Control Points are so stale even the 2 headed birds won't go near it. The battery game modes are the games redeeming factor though. The way the game shifts from offence to defence while teams fight over the batteries is hugely interesting. It's the best thing about the game, defending your batteries from the enemy when you're winning then shifting to offence when they have more than you. It's a fun see saw and is the game's only redeeming factor.\n\nThe shooting is horrible. The hit detection is janky and suffers from the whole "it takes 10 shots to kill an enemy but only 4 to get killed by the the same gun while wearing the same armor" syndrome. I don't know if it's just not registering properly or over compensating, but the feeling of your guns being crap when everyone elses is great is just degrading. DESPITE BOTH PARTIES USING THE SAME WEAPON!\n\nAlso you can get killed in one shot by sniper rifles WITH HITS TO THE LEGS AND ARMS! Some might argue "You die from the shock! It's supposed to be realistic!" ♥♥♥♥♥ I have pants that regenerate my health! How the ♥♥♥♥ is that realistic!\n\nNow it's time to look at the disparity between the factions. There's 4 in total. 2 are based around survival against anomalies, the other is built for combat. In a game where the anomalies are put to the side in favour of combat, which one do you think is going to profit more in an arena shooter? The one who'se equipment lets you survive the anomalies longer or the one who'se equipment turns you into a walking tank? I've played matches where my entire team was spawn camped by these hulking monstrosities, fueled by rage and fully upgraded equipment that ran on the maximum defence possible and our tears.\n\nIn case you missed it in the last paragraph. I mentioned Upgraded Equipment. The game allows you to upgrade the equipment you obtain in the game using scrap. Upgrading equipment gives it a random stat which is possible to change later on, stats include armor, reliability, isolation, damage, armor penetration, and many more and with time it's possible to fully upgrade your gear to be the best in the game. It's a time and money sink, and a way to keep you invested in playing when you've maxed out your factions and waiting for more content to be released.\n\nNow it's time to rage about the map design. Do you know what the best kind of maps are in an arena shooter? The Symmetrical kind. The kind that offers both teams the exact same environmental advantages and disadvantages, and works so well in TDM and Control Point game modes. Survarium doesn't do that. Survarium maps, while graphically impressive and have some great center pieces, are as balanced as a drunk trying to walk in a straight line. Let me give you an example. Rudnya. A sleepy deserted town where a church stands over a lake. A map where one team spawns in and around a house and the other spawns in an abandoned building with only 2 exits. Spawn camp ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ city. This happens in a lot of maps where one side is given an advantage the other one doesn't, and has nothing to make up for it. In the school map, one team has easy access to the roof of their spawn building which offers superb high ground and multiple levels which overlook their battery container. The other side spawns on the ground level and has to jump like Super Mario just to get onto the roof while having very little verticality to take advantage of. It's to be expected to have a base in which you spawn in the battery game mode, but what about TDM and CP? The developers made a great decision in the past to allow you to spawn in a random location in TDM and it was great! You didn't get spawn camped and had a chance of fighting back, spawning safe in a random location, not knowing where the enemy was, but also having the enemy not know where you were. It was balanced and fun. The developers made the even greater decision later on TO REVERT SPAWNS BACK TO BASES AND ENCOURAGE SPAWN CAMPING ONCE AGAIN!\nI can't even get into the lighting because there's a text limit for these reviews.\n\nNow it's time to talk about my favourite part. The anomalies.\n\nThis was the main selling point of the game for me. As you can see in the quirky little review I made at the top of this review. When I first started playing the game Anomalies were areas of the map that dealt radiation damage to you if you weren't equipped to traverse them. Sometimes these areas would offer alternative routes that allowed you to reach the enemy base quicker and safely. The disadvantage of this would be that you weren't equipped to handle the combat as well as the other players, but you had the chance of finding artifacts that could help you in fights, such as taking reduced damage from bullets, infinite sprint for a short duration and faster health regeneration. Again, you had to set up your equipment to be able to hold these, which ment you had to sacrifice equipment slots for artifact slots. Again. It was balanced, it was fun and offered an alternative play style to the running and gunning. You could play in the deadly chemicals and radiation and get rewarded for it while being equally viable in combat with other players. Not forgetting of course that the anomalies make great center pieces for the maps. Rudnya has a toxic lake scattered with vortexes that kill you when you walk through both them and the water\n\nSomeone in design thought it was a good idea to get take the artifacts out of the anomalies and have them randomly spawn around the map in giant disco lights, taking the fun out of exploring the anomalies.  I'm not kiding. They emit bright and sickening colours that wouldn't look amiss in an acid trip and they end up spawning everywhere and they deal damage to you when you get close to them, becoming a burden on people who didn't build their gear to survive the anomalies "But you still need to wear protection to pick them up" I hear you say. Your right. You do. But you have to ask yourself what you need the most protection from? The anomalies or the guns shooting at you while you try to pick up/neutralise the anomalies. Not forgetting the fact you can only use each anomaly once then they're gone, meaning you have to run around in the line of fire to restock, while those who saw sense and built their gear for combat just have to run back to the ressupply to restock their grenades, bandages, mines, etc.\n\nAnd the best bit? Some of the game modes don't even have anomalies in them! Imagine building yourself to survive what's left of the selling point of the game, only to realise the game mode your'e playing took them out and that you're effectively useless in all aspects except being the anomaly removing ♥♥♥♥♥?\n\nAnd THAT'S what's wrong with the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sauceysabre/recommended/355840/","sauceysabre","Solid Ferret","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sauceysabre/","84 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAlright, here's the shakedown for this game.\n\n\nPros:\n\n1: Game has beautiful graphics\n2: Concept is amazing.\n3: Actually well thought out mechanics.\n\nCons:\n\nMatchmaking. This game is solely multiplayer, which i thought at first was pretty cool. You start out with people of your level and it goes from there. I was totally wrong. Every game after "The first battle" that you're thrown into (as warned by the game), you're consistantly matched with opponents that are better equipped and much higher tier than you. Often you're matched with a team of a consistant equipment tier that you are, leaving all the upper tiers to the enemy team, making it honestly near impossible to play. The past ten games i've played have been like this, with before the ten being a single "Research mode" and the starting game. This single con, all by its self, ruins the aspect of the game for me. The reason being due to the fact that, spawn camping becomes extremely prevalent, and don't even bother saying "Oh you can just leave the game", "Well the pros outweigh the cons", or even "It's beta, give it a break". A beta game usually has its proper matchmaking system together to make gameplay consistant and balanced, where as this game just throws a huge amount of people together, quite often with one side heavily stacked, and leaves it like that. <---- this to me is game breaking\n\nWith these in mind, another con, is the weapon balance. You could say "Well it's like real life, some weapons are stronger than others, and this game is trying to be realistic.", but to be honest, an SMG style weapon VS a sniper rifle, I should be able to spray at close range (iron sighted in) and easily remove the threat, while compensating for recoil. But instead, the scenario turns on its head, and i miss most of my shots due to either a bad server connection, or enemy armor that outmatches my gun. <---- This needs to be balanced\n\nAgain, with servers in mind. This game is heavily Russian influenced, and i wouldn't be surprised if most of the player base was russian (or people from that area). Which leaves people like me (your average white guy) with a terrible ping, and gameplay to go with it. <---- that needs to be fixed\n\nSo to wrap up, the graphics and game idea, as well as the menus, are made amazingly, but, the matchmaking system, as well as the weaponry, really need to be re-balanced if not overhauled before i even consider coming back to this game.

NA servers are still turned off, even though they were promised to be put back on for .28 update. Netcode is still bad. I haven't seen much teamkilling, but of course with the influx of legitimate players for .28 I would hold off on saying TKing is "fixed" until the playerbase dies down a bit. Overall, review still stands.\n\nTL;DR - I don't recommend this game until longstanding issues such as bad netcode, spawn protection, the ability to kick/ban players, and freemode are released.\n\nAs a longtime fan of STALKER and Metro 2033, I really wanted to like this game by Vostok Games. I should go over the good first.\n\nThe Good:\n\n-Fantastic production values for a free-to-play game.\n\n-Beautiful atmosphere and sound design.\n\n-All weapons feel good to handle.\n\n-Unobtrusive shop for real items. Never felt forced to buy anything.\n\n-Matchmaking doesn't take too long.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-Bad netcode means constant stutters, rubberbanding, bad hit detection, hangups on environment, and extremely high ping.\n\n-Currently, no North American servers. Expect ping to be between 150-300 if you are in the Americas.\n\n-No dedicated servers. Always sucks when people are forced into matchmaking.\n\n-No spawn protection, meaning spawn killing is in every match.\n\n-No punishment for team killers. They can run rampant in a match and rack up dozens of kills on their own side, with no ban or kick since it's not implemented.\n\n-No long-term goals. Mostly just a TDM grind.\n\n-Small, fractured playerbase. Expect that to shrink as North America has been shirked on the servers.\n\n-No freemode. I went in knowing there wouldn't be, but it would incentivize plenty of players to stay if there actually was an MMOFPS mode.\n\nFor how far they are along, it's very sad how many of these problems could be patched with simple hotfixes and later on fully fixed, but that leaves me with the biggest problem: Vostok Games isn't interested in the player base. They aren't communicating except through volunteer moderators and PR, which means the majority of these problems have been around since the RU server was released a year ago, and they still haven't been fixed.\n\nI'm not sure I have faith that this game will reach its potential. Perhaps in a later update I will eat my words.

Please check the comments section of this review for more info about this. <]<]<] Original review follows below:\n\nSurvarium is an ongoing project that is still officially in beta (albeit in the international open beta stage now), growing since the start of development in 2012. Recently, groups of scammers have appeared in the media who have insolently tried to use the renown of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series to get some quick money by impersonating the old developers, but don’t worry – the studio behind Survarium (that is Vostok Games) is genuine. It is based in Kiev, Ukraine and it really was formed by some of the former employees of GSC Game World. Their aim is to create an online spiritual successor to the Stalker games, but one that has its own character and avoids the copyright infringement problems of that trilogy.\n\nAs for the game itself, it is a first-person shooter which currently has only one game type called “Teamplay” – though there is some variety in terms of objectives, as Teamplay is divided up into three separate modes: the first revolves around competing against an opposing team in capturing batteries and carrying them to your team’s base; in the second one you have to vie for control over strategic points on the battlefield; as well as the third and last mode, which is your typical team deathmatch. Teams are made up of eight people each, totalling up to sixteen players per match. The gunplay is slower and thus feels slightly more realistic than the average shooter, whilst the gorgeous maps of reasonable size make for engaging battles, during which the authentic firearm sounds go splendidly well with the immersive ambient soundtrack.\n\nGenerally, the game has evolved quite a bit through gradual little steps – it now has four distinct factions, personalised loadouts, clans and squads, side missions to complete during PvP matches, plenty of varied weapons and equipment to choose from, different ammunition types, decals and a choice of materials to customise your outfit with, artefacts to collect in-game that give you temporary bonuses, a rudimentary skill point system for your character, etc. It has also become a much more stable game than it used to be, with less glitches and crashes. However, the main feature that everyone is waiting for is the “Freeplay” game mode, which will bring larger open world maps that will provide an environment for session-based nonlinear survival gameplay (à la Stalker or DayZ).\n\nAt this moment in time, Survarium has few features on offer that would separate it from other F2P competitive shooters. It resembles S.T.A.L.K.E.R. aesthetically since it is post-apocalyptic fiction and most of the game’s maps have an Eastern Bloc feel to them, but the gameplay is less interesting and doesn’t have much in common with the beloved Slavic classics that we all know. Unfortunately, the creators at Vostok have stumbled a few times too by making numerous wrong decisions, such as dividing the game’s growing international community (along with all the clans and friendships formed within) into three regional servers or by almost continuously marginalising the non-European segments of their fanbase. Nevertheless, the game in its current state is at a decent level of quality, but with Freeplay due later this year along with the implementation of many other promised features to come… let’s just say that the best is yet to come.\n\n--------------------------\n\nPOLSKA RECENZJA\n\n[>[>[> Już nie rekomenduję tej gry, ale również nie mogę tego tutaj wlepić ani zmienić ocenę na negatywną ze względu na to, jak działają recenzje na Steam. W komentarzach tej recenzji znajdziecie więcej informacji na ten temat <]<]<] Pierwotna recenzja poniżej:\n\nUWAGA: Mam mało godzin nabitych w tej grze, bo gram w nią od 2014 roku, czyli zanim została wydana wersja na platformie Steam.\n\nSurvarium to trwający projekt, który jest wciąż w becie (aczkolwiek już w etapie światowej „bety otwartej”), rosnący od rozpoczęcia przedsięwzięcia w 2012 roku. Niedawno w mediach pojawiły się grona oszustów, którzy bezczelnie próbowali użyć sławy S.T.A.L.K.E.R.a, aby szybko zarobić trochę pieniędzy poprzez podszywanie się pod znanych producentów, ale bez obaw – studio, które stoi za Survarium (tj. Vostok Games) jest szczere. Mieści się ono w Kijowie, na Ukrainie i naprawdę zostało założone przez część byłych pracowników z GSC Game World. Ich celem jest stworzenie gry sieciowej, która ma być duchowym spadkobiercą Stalkera, tworząc przy tym własną tożsamość, unikając problemy z naruszeniem praw autorskich tamtej trylogii.\n\nJeśli chodzi o samą grę, jest to FPS, który obecnie ma tylko jeden rodzaj gry o nazwie „Gra Zespołowa” – tym niemniej istnieje kilka odmian pod względem celów, gdyż Gra Zespołowa podzielona jest na trzy odrębne tryby: pierwszy polega na konkurowaniu z wrogą drużyną o to, kto zbierze najwięcej baterii i doniesie je do własnej bazy; w drugim walczymy o kontrolowanie punktów strategicznych na polu bitwy; oraz trzeci, który jest typowym „team deathmatch”. Poszczególne zespoły składają się z ośmiu ludzi, co w sumie wynosi szesnastu graczy na mecz. Sama rozgrywka toczy się wolniej, niż w przeciętnej strzelance, dzięki czemu wydaje się bardziej realistyczna, podczas gdy przepiękne mapy, zresztą o rozsądnym rozmiarze, pozwalają na zajmujące potyczki, w których autentyczne brzmienie broni palnej pasuje świetnie do wciągającej ambientowej ścieżki dźwiękowej.\n\nZ upływem czasu gra zmieniła się znacznie, choć działo się to stopniowo. Ma ona teraz cztery frakcje, spersonalizowane „loadouty”, klany i brygady, poboczne zadania do wykonania podczas meczów PvP, mnóstwo rozmaitej broni i ekwipunku do wyboru, odmienne rodzaje amunicji, dostosowanie wyposażenia poprzez naszywki i wybór tkaniny, artefakty z tymczasowymi bonusami do zebrania podczas rozgrywki, rudymentarny układ punktów umiejętności dla postaci, itd. Gra stała się również dużo bardziej stabilna, niż niegdyś była; z mniejszą ilością „glitchów” i „crashów”. Jednak główna rzecz, na którą wszyscy czekają, to tzw. „Swobodna Gra”, która udostępnić ma nam większe mapy typu otwarty świat, gdzie toczyć się będzie prawdziwa walka o przetrwanie na podstawie nieliniowej rozgrywki (jak w Stalkerze albo DayZ).\n\nW tej chwili Survarium nie posiada zbyt wielu cech, które odróżniłyby grę od innych konkurencyjnych strzelanek w rodzaju „free-to-play”. Estetyka przypomina tu gry z serii S.T.A.L.K.E.R., ponieważ uniwersum Survarium także przynależy do gatunku fantastyki postapokaliptycznej i większość z map w grze ma atmosferę powiązaną z blokiem wschodnim, lecz sama rozgrywka jest mniej interesująca i nie ma wiele wspólnego ze słowiańskimi klasykami, które wszyscy znamy i kochamy. Niestety sami twórcy z Vostok potknęli się już kilka razy, podejmując nieprawidłowe decyzje, chociażby dzieląc międzynarodową społeczność (łącznie ze wszystkim klanami i przyjaźniami, które w niej powstały) na trzy serwery regionalne, czy też wielokrotnie marginalizując swoich fanów spoza Europy. Niemniej jednak, produkt w obecnym kształcie jest na przyzwoitym poziomie, ale biorąc pod uwagę, że tryb „Swobodna Gra” jest przewidywany jeszcze w tym roku razem z wieloma innymi obiecanymi funkcjami… możemy powiedzieć, że to, co najlepsze jeszcze przed nami.","April 2, 2015","true","82.6"," 220 of 347 people (63%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","63","220","347","23","6"

Unfortunately the final result is not that great, Survarium as in version 0.30 is a rather disappointing F2P fps shooter, at least given the high expectations raised from the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. legacy.\n\nPros:\n- Nicely drawn and detailed maps, one playing differently than the other.\n- Anomalies provide a new feature compared to standard shooters.\n- Realistic gun sounds and effects.\n- Four different fractions to choose with different weapon / equipment settings.\n\nCons:\n- Few maps, gameplay tends to get repetitive after some spending some hours\n- Battles seem to be very unbalanced both in tier ratings and in player efficiencies.\n- A lot of "pay to gain advantage" elements, they ruin game progress: Ok, it is reasonable to expect premium account, or premium equipment to advance faster (like War Thunder or WoT). But here besides these you are almost forced to pay gold to modify equipment, to buy extra maps for after-battle looting etc. This is too much, it creates a gap between paying and non-paying players. For example why to have just a 50% probability of success to modify something when you pay with "regular" credits (and parts) and 100% probability when paying with gold? Not to mention that I seriously doubt if the 50% rate is accurate...\n- Small-sized teams lead to serious balance issues when players from one side disconnect or go afk.\n- Seems to be a very large fraction of players with hacks. This is very serious, actions should be taken to prevent cheating rather than punishing it. It simply ruins the experience.\n- Small player base, at late times balanced battles (with respect to equipment) seem to be the exception.\n- Anomalies and the related environment seem greatly undeveloped. An aspect which should be central to a S.T.A.L.K.E.R-based game. Their visual effects seem controversial, personally I would prefer a different implementation. Benefits and dangers from interacting with anomalies, which are very localized and small-sized are also under-developed.\n- way too much spawn killing.\n\nAt this point I can not recommend the game. Perhaps in a future update I will revisit it, especially waiting the free-to-explore-world mode. As it stands now it has potential, but the general gaming experience is underwhelming...","August 16, 2015","false","53.9"," 40 of 50 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","40","50","5","1"

This game is in "Open Beta", but if I am to be brutally honest it feels like an alpha.\n\n1. The servers are TERRIBLE, between crashing, no after-game rewards gain, and the fact that the closest server has at lowest 85 ping.\n\n2. In-part due to the terrible ping, hit-reg is extremely spotty making anything other than extreme close range not a viable option.\n\n3. Could also be due to the issue of ping / hit-reg, but it feels like the hitboxes are a bit screwy. Headshots often register as body shots, or even worse harmlessly travel through enemies with no registration.\n\n4. The sounds of the guns are really nice, but the positional audio is not good (I.E. difficult to tell direction of gun fire / footsteps).\n\n5. The game does not perform as one might think it should. The graphics are decent enough, but certainly not groundbreaking. I achieve a maximum of 70 FPS at max settings, whereas on more 'graphically intensive' games I can get double.\n\n5. A lack of many common things in modern FPS games. No in-game VoIP, no windowed-borderless, etc.\n\n6. In order to unlock more interesting weaponry, it is required that you level up in the requisite faction. The grind is very slow and many cool or unique weapons / armor are paid items only.\n\n7. Likely, because of these aformentioned issues, the playerbase is small. The most I have to see online at one time is around 2000 people. As I write this review, the number of players online is 300. Depending on tier, I have waited an upwards of 10 minutes to enter a game.\n\n8. After browsing the forums and developer notes I've realized that the game is much farther behind schedule than they lead you to believe. According to the developer's release timeline they are more than a year behind and there has been little mention of what is to happen and when.\n\nAll-in-all, I'm very disappointed. I will keep track of update notes and update this review if I find that the game makes more progress, but for now I will stay away and I advise you to do the same.","July 2, 2015","false","22.1"," 47 of 62 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","47","62","4","2"

Maps are very though out, often multiple pathways to get from point A to B\n2-Guns are rather comfy, have yet to run into anything clunky to aim and fire\n3-has a pretty solid gear system, pros and cons to various types of armor, and EVERYTHING is upgradable\n4-You are not stuck having to buy things both in game money or Irl money, you will often find items after matches like medkits,guns,clothes\n5-Active community so match wait time is very low.\n6-Not required to pay money to have any form of fun, game is 100% playable without spending a dime\n\nCons-\n1-There are bought weapons, these weapons are usually stronger than base game weapons but fortunatly the bought guns are rather pointless and useless after level 6. you can get weapons just as good, if not better through earning them than through the irl money store.\n2-It takes a higher end machine to really run this game well. yes you can fiddle with the setting and all but to really you still run a chance at fps drop and stuttery movement\n3-there are a few cheaters but then again when isnt there in video games\n4-from what I can tell updates are rather slow.\n5-the penalty for leaving games or going afk is not strict enough (in my opinion) and so you will run into games where you might have 2-3 people afk.\n6-the lower level youa are the more toxic the players are oddly enough. but it seems to die down a lot after a few levels as it matches you up against people within a level range.\n7-earning money can be rather slow at times, so progression is not the greatest. BUT you have a good chance at finding usable gear/consumable after each game so  suppose that makes up for it.\n8-there ARE adds after each map but then again its a f2p game. there is bound to be a few adds here and there slutting for premium or to buy games with irl money\n\nAll in all its a fun game, *shrug* its free to play so its not like i can ♥♥♥♥♥ about money spent\n","December 9, 2015","true","8.0"," 63 of 94 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","63","94","4","0"

There are many enjoyable moments, but for every great match there's three or four terrible ones, mostly due to bad ping (only populated server is EU) and extreme hackers. The devs are extremely proactive and fair when it comes to publicly banning every offender reported, but the hacking problem is so out of control that there's not much they can do; they ban one hacker and ten spring up in their place, mainly because they've got no anti-cheat setup that'll stop the current aimbot/x-ray vision hacks that're popular now. I want to recommend Survarium so badly because of the upcoming freeplay mode which promises to be incredibly good, but the game is currently an extreme exercise in frustration due to the hackers, who will probably hack that mode badly too.

Yes they did, but it's even harder for anyone else who gets the game later to get these weapons, because everyone else is already running around with them.\n2:The "Matchmaking"\nI hate the way this game matches players with eachother. Other games say "Matches you with players of similar skill", when all it does is match players based off their levels. This game matches players based off the quality of their gear. This may not seem bad, but when you think about it, good gear and high levels do not equal skill and expiriance. In other games, you can easily be an average player, destroy the noobs, struggle your way out of your average comrades, and then be faced by high level players. In this game, you can be a complete noob, finish your first few matches, and get beginners luck on the looting at the end of the game and get yourself some dope gear. And then the remorseless high level players say "Welcome to Survarium" with the barrels of their assault and sniper rifles.\n\nThese two things tie in with eachother, you can't say someone with good gear is good at the game because he may just have beginner's luck. And Placing the overpowered weapons of the game up in higher levels, out of reach of noobs does not make them balanced. I needed to write this review from a noob/casual stand point because not everyone is a hardcore gamer and cannot just "Get Gud", simply because they either don't want to go hard at the game and just want to play for fun, or just do not have enough time in general to commit to it. In my opinion a game should try to be as fun for everyone as possible. I do hope the game developers take this review into consideration to make the better game. If they do not however, I just can not bring myself to play any more of it, these things about it make it seem so horrible, when there are so many good things about it.","November 27, 2015","false","9.3"," 41 of 58 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","41","58","3","0"

And here's why.\n\nPros\nSound; weapons are perfect. Every gun sounds meaty and and powerful.\nVisuals; I firmly believe that the graphics engine is actually nice. The flora looks really defined and looks like what actual overgrowth would. The anomolies look beautiful, honestly have more of an alluring beauty than S.T.A.L.K.E.R.'s did. The weapons are sleek and look very nice. I wish they'd be a little more beat up and obviously worn out. The maps in this game are astonishingly perfect. I'd hug the designer of these maps if I could.\nGameplay; Guns are very easy to handle and just plain fun to use. Honestly one of the better FPS gameplay I've played in a while. The store is nice and straightforward. I really enjoy the lore and clothing items for each faction, I think it'll be really fun when the factions and players in the factions have a larger role, ie., roleplaying in PVE.\nAnomolies/Artifacts; Anomolies are amazing, I love the differences and habitats each one has, some matches I would just sit there studying them.\nCons\nGunplay; Auto's, especially SMG's are too accurate. Plain and simple. It's broken and too accurate to be realistic. A PPSH shouldn't have the same amount of accuracy at full auto as a Remington 700.\nSound; Sound of footsteps need to be louder, sometimes the audio for it even cuts out. There's no audio for rain.\nAnomolies/Artifacts; Anomolies aren't honestly intimidating enough, the blue gel at Chemical Factory honestly doesn't do anything but is a surface to walk on. Artifacts, and how their buffs work doesn't seem to be enough for me personally. They have a roughly 30 second cooldown, but they're active for five. I believe the buff should stay on until you die for PVP.\nAs for the "P2W" everyone complains about, there honestly isn't one. Yeah, there's guns you can buy with gold, but all it does is give a Silver Rubles bonus, Rate of Fire bonus(Reload, recoil, or aiming speed depending on the gun) and Reliability bonus. You can get as many kills with a Toz-34 as someone with the gold paid MR-27M Lancaster. The gold is honestly more used for decoration of your uniform if anything.\n\nTL:DR; I give this a solid 7/10. I can't wait for the full and most anticipated release.","April 9, 2015","true","39.4"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","74","34","46","7","0"

All of the controls seem intuitive and simple. the game play is at a good speed (most of the time) and lobby's seem to be found within 1 Minuet. there is an option to spend money on the game, This is not a big issue because the items you get are obtainable with a little hard work, money just speeds up the process\nMost of all the game is really FUN!\n\nBAD:\nSome of the little things on the floor will stop you in your tracks and you will have to spend a few seconds wiggling around to get off of them.\nIt is clear that there are "Best" guns that make most of the other guns not even worth buying.\nthere are a few people in game who are using aim bots but i have only seen 7-8 out of the hundreds i have played with.\nsome things like tree branches or tiny railings stop your bullets, even some leafs.\nsome of the SMG/Assult rifles seem to have the same range and accuracy as sniper rifles (may be hackers)\n\nOVERALL:\nGreat game that i would recommend to anyone who likes FPS games after a bit of polishing and touching up this would be one of the best free to play shooters out there. 9/10\n\n","April 13, 2015","true","23.7"," 39 of 55 people (71%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","71","39","55","6","2"

The MAJOR downside to this, is that due to the tiny population (hindered further by the botched steam launch) means that the matchmaking ends up putting you with people several tiers  higher than you (levels 1-10).  Where people can have up to 90% bullet damage resist, meaning your little starter weapons with only 10% armour pen and 25 damage ends of doing sweet F all to them.\n\nBut when you get a match against similarly skilled and geared players,  it's insanely fun! Especially on the objective based gametypes (domination style and a multi-neutral-flag CTF style).\n\nI wouldn't suggest spending money on the game unless you have the cash to burn,  don't be suckered in with thinking you can just buy a high tier gun and play with the big boys becuse you'll get matchmade with them, but won't have the armour to survive.    I'd recomend getting the Warrior or Sniper packs, that gives you high tier armour as well as a high tier gun, the armour gives you extra faction XP and the gun gives you more $$$ in game.   Then with the remaining gold that you have, I'd seriously recommend getting as many faction reputation boosts as you can get, this way you can level up whatever faction you like, whenever you like, without having to worry about having a monthly "premium" thing to worry about as each booster only works for 24 hours.    That way you don't have to play the game every day just to get value for your money.\n\nLastly, the major part about this game being awesome isn't even out yet,  "Free-play",  which is basically S.T.A.L.K.E.R style roaming with PvE.  So frickin keen for that!\n\nIn summary,  yes you should try it, yes you should remember it's early access and has many bugs/crashes/etc, no you shouldn't throw money at it until you see yourself getting into it down the line, but Survarium is definitely a game to keep your eyes on should you be a fan of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series or the METRO series.\n\nCurrent state 5/10\nWhat I expect down the line 7.5/10\n\nAnyway, back to playing Survarium for me :D\n","June 12, 2015","true","196.5"," 55 of 84 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","55","84","4","0"

Please disregard the time played. --\n#16th Revision. Made 3rd of April#\nThis review is made to be really, really, really thorough!\n\nA small introduction to the game itself:\nFor those of you who didn't know this in advance, Vostok Games is a company made by former employees, of the company who made the "S.T.A.L.K.E.R." series. These games took place in a apocalyptic setting, with factions, artifacts & anomalies and of course irradiated creatures as some of its features.\nSurvarium does quite good at following the theme of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, featuring incredibly detailed maps, a realistic gameplay and the anomalies. When you enter a map, you'll quite fast get the feeling of the game, and what it's trying to tell you, so to speak. You can gather the mentioned anomalies and use them in combat, giving you various 'perks'. These will be somewhat easy to find, once you've played the maps a lot. The website[eu.survarium.com]'s forum can also help you with in-game locations.\n\nTheir F2P-model, explained:\nThis is a tough one. They've done it quite smart, in my opinion. Let's put it to a list!\nGold.. Purchasable, and it should be able to drop after a completed match too (confirmed here[marker.to]).\nPremium accounts.. It's pretty much the usual - it gives you an increased chance of finding items (usually cosmetics) after a completed match, more XP pr match and more reputation pr match. And that's it for the premium account.\nWeapon durability.. After playing a lot of matches with your weapon, it'll wear out, and you'll have to repair it. There's multiple ways to do this - you can either choose to repair with the purchasable gold, which will repair it instantly - or you can use the in-game currency, which will result in you having to wait for your weapon to be done (usually above 3 hours). This does mean that it's hard to repair your weapons instantly as a free user, but as with the gold, the weapon repair kits should have a chance to drop (confirmed here[marker.to]).\nPremium weapons.. Increased durability, and does often got very small attributes like less weight.\nMMOFPS? I can only play smalls scale PvP!\nI guess we can take this head-on. The game has right now (version 0.27d right now) only a few modes available, only small scale PvP. Right now, it features:\n"Capture-the-Battery" (CtF) in two different variations - main objective is of course to get the battery, and return to your base. (You'll be rewarded extra XP for this, plus extra % in searching after items[eu.survarium.com], after completed a battle)\nOne where you got to find the batteries yourself, without any help what so ever.\nAnd one where you've got to protect 'stations' spread around the map, containing batteries, and then bring them back to your base.\nTeam Deathmatch (TDM). There's not much to this. The first one to reach 0 wins. The starting value varies.\nResearch. It's quite basic, capture 'points' (usually 3 points - A, B & C) - and hold them. And hold enemies off them! The more points/stations your team's got, the faster you'll win. The first team to reach the target score wins.\nFreeplay (TBA - read below)Sooner, there'll be the (anticipated!) kind-of-MMOFPS open-world survival gamemode. It's named 'Freeplay' as of now, and you can read much more about it here: >> Click Me![eu.survarium.com] << (do yourself a favor, and read it up).\n\nWhat's the game good for in its current state? (EDITED!)\nLets do the usual pros & cons.\n-Pros:\nThe maps & the audio\nThe maps are probably some of the best maps I've ever played/seen. The details are immense - you will have a hard time finding the same pattern in the maps -  every item seems to be specifically placed there, to create an immersive atmosphere. You can look at screenshots here[eu.survarium.com] or, even better, the concept art here[eu.survarium.com]. The different map designs could be the sole reason to try out this game!\nThey've also done a lot of work to create a realistic overall feeling of sound in the game.. You can watch this >behind-the-scenes video< to watch a preview of how much detail they've actually put into this.\nGameplay\nBeyond the bleeding, the game's really amazingly realistic. You can't sprint forever, and when you're out of breath, it'll take time to stabilize your sniper-scope. If you're wearing a headset (this is subjective of course), you can easily hear where people are around you - you can hear the footsteps, hear the gunshots and exactly where they're coming from. There's an amazing atmosphere.\nActive developers, active community\nOf course this should be a standard in the gaming industry, but it's not. But these guys are really picking up their pace, making this game really good. The patches are slow (look at the cons), but they're quite active on the forums during their development process. -Cons:\nWell.. It's beta!\nAnd just begun their open-beta phase. It's been in a much, much, much, much worse state than it is now - but there are still bugs to find. You can get stuck in random objects (this doesn't happen very often), and crashing can occur (these have drastically fallen though, but they do still occur).\nA not-so-good FPS-model\nGold is hardly earnable after somewhere between 0.27 and versions above, which makes the repairing part much more harder to put through as an non-paying user. I haven't had the need of buying the gold (yet) though, but they've changed it a lot since I've played.\n(?) I don't understand Ukrainian/Russian\nThe developers will always post updates and such in English, but there's a very large playerbase who speaks Ukrainian and Russian only - which can make it hard to e.g. exchange enemy positions, ask about battery positions, etc. This is of course a very subjective 'con'.\nSlow updates (please read below, before making presumptions about how cruel I am)\nThis is probably not their fault so to speak. They're a small, concentrated team and they're really doing a great a job improving Survarium - but for an example, the freeplay-mode was announced years ago, and it's still not ready as of today (3rd of April).\nWeird, varying matchmaking\nThe matchmaking is right now quite complicated to figure out. As a new player, you'll probably be slayed a lot to begin with. The average player (usually the Ukrainian/Russian-named ones) will slay you without you having a chance. There seem to be (sometimes) a quite big gap between the different players skill level. In one match, you can kill everyone, and in the next one you'll simply be to put to the ground before you can blink.\nConclusion:\nAs of now, I would give it 7/10 -- I won't give it 10/10 before I've seen and/or played the Freeplay-mode!\n\nThe pros in this game overshadows the cons, and hopefully it'll exceed your expectations, even after reading this review. It's still my favorite Free-to-Play FPS as of yet. I decreased my rating to a 7, since they removed quite a few of my favorite aspects, including earning the purchasable gold. I moved their F2P model as one the 'cons', since it's really a big flaw in this game, if you can't earn the gold as a non-paying user.. So the review's probably not as kind anymore as it started off to be.","April 2, 2015","true","10.7"," 79 of 127 people (62%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","62","79","127","8","15"

You're thinking that from all of the positive reviews, that this game must be somewhat decent. Do not fall into this trap. On the surface, it seems like a fun free-to-play shooter, but don't be fooled. This game is garbage. I'm not just some salty noob. I've noticed things that cripple any potential this game has for being good. My biggest complaints are the clunkiness. This game (which is trying to be an arcade shooter of sorts) is as clunky as ARMA. This would be acceptable if the game was more tactical, but instead it ends up seeming like Call of Duty on meth. Aiming down sights in this game is a complete joke. When aiming, there's no smoothness. Slightly moving one's mouse doesn't adjust the sights to the target, it jumps pixels. This make long range engagements complete poo, because all iron sight weapons can't properly zero in on the target- they jump around it because of the poor integration of this mechanic. This makes long range fights impossible for those who can't dump money onto this low population, russian filled dumpster for a sniper rifle. There isn't any pay to win mechanic, but the fact that the weapons that can be bought on the paywall can only be obtained naturally through extremely boring grinding only serves to prove that the game is either looking for players to dump cash on it or leave. The community though, is the most hilarious part. Besides the rampant teamkillers and occasional hacker, the game has little to no population. 400 players is not only unacceptable, but hilarious considering this is an early access game. The majority of players that you will encounter are Russian, and hence you're in one of two positions- very laggy, or among extremely laggy people. This entire game is worthless and broken.\n\nI give it a 5/10 only for one aspect, and that is the sound design. The gun sounds in this game are better than many other first person shooters, but this isn't enough to save the game. IMO, if the amount of time sunk into recording the weapons was spent on actually fixing this, the game would be playable.\n\nAvoid at all costs. Play Insurgency or some of the better upcoming tactical shooters instead.","June 25, 2015","false","15.1"," 147 of 250 people (59%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","59","147","250","13","12"

There is a constant progression with XP, Faction Reputation and Silver (in-game currency).\n\n- Getting XP, helps you reach higher levels, on each new level you gain a skill point to spend on a "talent" tree.\n- Faction Reputation is gained to reach new "faction ranks", which depending on the Faction you have chosen, will allow  you to buy different Armor / Weapons / etc.\n- Finally, there is Silver gained, using it you can repair your gear (armor, weapon), replenish ammunition / grenades / first aid kits / etc. or even pay for Weapon / Armor upgrades.\n\nThe item upgrades are random attributes which cost money and "upgrade tokens" which can only be obtained randomly after each game or by dismantling another item. Also note that item upgrades paid with silver have a 50% probability of success but if paid with gold (micro transaction currency), they have 100% probability but still grant a random stat.\n\nThe item upgrade random stat can be from Health Regeneration, to Bleed Effect Reduction and the statistic amount given is also random (0.5% - 2.5% for example). If you receive an unwanted stat or a low number, you can pay with silver every 6 hours to attempt to get a better mod or with gold for instant and unlimited retries.\n\n\nAll in all, the game is fun and allows various play styles (close quarters combat, long range with snipers, etc).\nIt has a steep learning curve I might say and at the low levels/tiers of gear (not levels of character), there are possibly some hackers around to make your life miserable. As you progress and level up your gear, you will encounter less and less hackers but at the same time, better geared/experienced players which might seem to you as hackers...\n\nIt requires heavy "grind" to level up both your XP and Faction Reputation, at the same time you will gather silver and use it purchase new gear. It takes time but it is worth it.\n\nI will end this review by saying this: if you want to play an easy multiplayer FPS that you can master and be good at in a few days, this game is not for you. This game, is mostly gear based which cannot be obtained easily/fast (unless you pay with real money).\n\nDo I pay for gear or premium subscription? No.\nDo I enjoy the game and plan to keep playing it? Yes.\nHave I reached the top level / rank / tier? No.","December 13, 2015","true","240.4"," 33 of 48 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","33","48","2","0"

I Can No Longer Recommend This Game Because Most Of The Things I Listed Below Such As Hit Registry & Armor Penetration Have Been Messed Up After They Updated The Game To The 0.28 Update\nAbsolutely Stunning Free To Play Shooter 0.27 Update\nOverview:Survarium is a post-apocalyptic free to play MMO FPS game. The game is primarily a first-person shooter, but also features several role-playing game elements.\n\n#1 The Sound: A lot of attention & detail has went in to the audial end of this game, From the environment hearing the wind whistle in your ears to the blades of grass colliding with each other to the sounds of the foot steps when people walk to the weapons firing. You will be able to hear every footstep & gunshot every little detail in stunning beautiful deafening glory. The weapon sounds are especially great! they really pack a punch!\n\n#2 The Atmosphere: Survariums post-apocalyptic atmosphere leaves absolutely nothing left to be desired, From its Abandoned cities & schools with over grown vegetation, To its Decaying waste lands, Ruined industrial sites & Its crumbling military bases, As mother nature begins to once again take over & rule with anomalies expanding across the planet with terrifying speed. There is so much beauty in this game. This game has a erie, creepy feel to it as well with its enemy AI in the form of mutants and environmental hazards such as anomalies.\n\n#3 Game Play & Mechanics: The game is very solid it feels very realistic, From your player moving sluggish from having to much armor on or carrying heavy weaponry, To the penalty of not having enough armor on to protect you. The inventory system is very well thought out having to plan ahead for certain situations due to your player only being able to carry so much, Only having 2 profile customizations really makes you think on what items would be best for close quarters or long range, Am I going to be carrying to much weight etc. The games main system is so well thought out it really makes you think & mix & match things up trying to find that perfect combo of weapons & armor & items without feeling like a 500 pound gorilla walking around.\n\n#4 Weapons & Damage: The weapons in this game are superb, From the way that they sound to the way they handle its very realistic & weapons really pack a huge punch!. The iron sights took me awhile to get used to but once I got the hang of it I was doing pretty decent. I can't stress this enough the guns in this game really pack a serious punch, Bullets really hurt if you get hit by a 7.62 bullet in the head you're dead period end of story you're done man you can't shrug off bullets like you can in other games. Like I said before with the bullets, But with armor it allows you to survive certain types of aommunition hits & this causes bleeding, You can bleed from any number of body part, Head, Chest, Legs, Arms & you have to bandage that up. The recoil on the guns is fantastic & as real as you can get, Example of this is the AK74M or AKM that thing kicks like crazy the recoil is extremely realistic but handles just great. Examples of me doing better with the iron sights see link here http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/539645482717945718/4FD2E3999B6C54F444CBF5734EC32EC47A420EEB/\n\n#5 Hit Registry & Connection: My Personal average ping on this game is 110ms which in most games thats a bad ping, But in this game its actually a decent ping, There is hardly ever any lag that I can tell off all in all it runs really welkl connection wise. Hit registry isn't exactly perfect but its pretty spot on aim for the head & you hit the head, Aim for the chest you hit the chest etc. I have had maybe 10 games out of the 40+ hours & several hundred matches where I didn't get a hit marker & caused the other guy to bleed out. Hit registry is spot on!\n\nWith everything being said I might update this review later on & add more as new content becomes available! As the game stands now I give it a 9 out of 10!\n\n5 OUT OF 10 AFTER THEY UPDATED FROM 0.27 TO 0.28!","April 13, 2015","true","184.8"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","24","32","3","0"

By the time I'm writing this review, update 0.40b is out. It brings a new interface and UI. In this review, I'll try to cover a few game mechanics that you should keep in mind.\n\nShooting Hit detection is broken. Sometimes you hit the enemy and it won't register it. Sometimes a player will come back from the dead. It needs a bit of a work.\n\nPay-2-win? It maybe seems like it has pay2win mechanics, but you can get most of the things by simply playing, but it takes a lot of time. Personally i think it's not that much of a pay2win game but some players can have unfair advantage if they would decide to buy every paid item in the game. But as I said earlier, it's debatable.\n\nGraphics It looks good. Not too good, but it's okay. It has really impressive lighting actually.\n\nUI It used to look really mediocre, but now the whole interface has been transformed into flat minimalistic design. I really like it. It gives the game a whole new look.\n\nGameplay It only offers a few game modes:\nDeathmatch\nCapture the flag\nPoint capturing\nThe last standIt's not much but it's enough to keep someone playing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/asphyxy/recommended/355840/","asphyxy","Ardent Apathy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/asphyxy/","76 products in account","Writing this review with a couple houndred hours on account, with my name on top 100 in the old ranking system. http://en.svfan.ru/players/288437-aasen/profile.html\n\nAs a long time fan of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchise, Survarium really caught my attention once Vostok Games announced they would make a PvE game back in 2012. The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games have probably been a big inspiration to most of the PvE games out there. Keeping an eye out on their Facebook page, hoping to get a spot in the alpha-testing, I finally got the chance to play the game through a founder pack in January 2014.\n\nSurvarium will follow up with an eerie world with a post apocalyptic setting. The world is full of scavengers, traders and factions with different beliefs about living in their new world. Once PvE is released it will be a open world where you're free to scavenge and hunt, mutch like one could realize S.T.A.L.K.E.R. to be with a MMO setting.\n\nSurvarium is in its beta stage, and it's anticipated PvE is said to come later this year. For beta-testing there's currently PvP in forms of TDM, Base Capture (like flag capture in Battlefield 2), and 2 modes of "collect the batteries", which is done by finding the batteries throghout the map, or picking them up from the charging stations and bringing them to your base. The PvP element feels a lot like the old version of Battlefield or other old shooters without the collapsing buildings, mixed with new shooters, and is quite addictive, but not as hard as you might find shooting in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games. Fights are mostly solved on a player's skill level, and the matches have a timer set to 15 minutes, but can be finished before if you complete the objective of the match.\n\nElse in it's current state the game features crafting, modifications, anomalies and a skill tree:\n\nCRAFTING and MODIFICATIONS:\nThe crafting consists of combining two pieces of gear of the same kind, and with some luck, end up with better equipment. They then change color affiliated with the total amount of modifications. The maximum amount of modifiers goes up to 3 per equipment. These range from reload speed, rate of fire, recoil reduction, aiming speed, armor, isolation, protection from bleeding, health regeneration, movement speed and so on. Keep in mind, you can only get one special modifier per equipment; you  can't get 3 of the same modifications on the same piece of equipment, but you can share them between different pieces of your gear to add up a total value. An example is to get +5% health regeneration on your lower body and upper body armor, and the total value will be 10%, an other example is to get reload reduction on your gloves and on your main weapon for fast reload. Once you've managed to get a modification on your equipment, you can change it for a price. This can be done every 6 hours, but can only be done to 1 out of 3 modifiers, so if you change one then you can only change that one modifier over and over.\n\nANOMALIES and ARTIFACTS:\nAnomalies are hazardous areas on the map that alters the game play. If you don't wear isolation gear entering these zones then you most likely will end up dead within seconds. In these areas there are artifacts that can be found and used in that match. The artifacts have both a passive and an active ability, ranging from faster run speed, health regeneration and damage block. You will need an artifact container on your gear to be able to pick up artifacts.\n\nSKILL TREE:\nDuring and after each match you gain experience points to level up. With each level comes one skill point that can be used in the skill tree. The skill tree helps your character become more suited for the higher equipment levels of gear, giving you increased weight limit, an extra ammo pouch and so on. Take a good look and figure out what's best for you.\n\nCombining all of these makes Survarium compete with other shooters, you don't just run and gun. This is one of those games where good camouflage and solid teamwork will pay, I can't tell you how many times I've got killed by that amazingly camouflaged player I just didn't see. The game was just released for open beta stage. Most of the players currently playing Survarium have played for a while, so expect quite a fight in some.\n\nEDIT:\nI see people write reviews about how this game is pay to win. Let me clarify, this is NOT a pay to win game. Everything in the game that you can craft and so on can be done with the money you earn in the game. The game is completely free to play, the only advantage you can get by paying is faster experience and level progression, and a 100% guarantee that your craft is not lost if you craft the same piece of colored equipment, else this is 50%. After a match you have a chance to obtain dropped items, they are somewhat rare, but I've had multiple +3 modification drops without having to pay anything, that including an amazing shotgun! Play and you will be rewarded!\n\nTo true S.T.A.L.K.E.R. fans, if you don't like this game now, come back when they launch PvE. The developers are fast at giving feedback and launches new information regularly on their forums -and now also on steam.\n\nPlease leave a comment if you don't find my review helpful, or need further insight.","April 2, 2015","true","230.4"," 60 of 99 people (61%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","61","60","99","8","0"

Some graphical glitches in game but they soon pass.\nGraphically it isn't bad, but its no crysis. 60fps solid on High/Ultra w/ R9 290 so at least its optimised well enough.\nSound is pretty good especially the guns sounding like they have some real power behind them, but it can be pretty loud (even at low volume) and overwhelming at times but could be being used to near silence from playing CS:GO.\nCurrently is only PvP with TDM and Domination style game modes, but it's still fun.\nExcited for the open-world PvE elements which provided they don't mess it up or suddenly give up for whatever reason, will be my main reason for playing this game. It has the potential to be a great survival game.\n*EDIT* Matchmaking can be a pain when placed against higher level players (like any game) especially those using armour and full autos, when you only have starting weapons with low armour pen. Provided you're matched with players of similar rank it can be a lot of fun and much more balanced. This simply could be due to a small player base.\n\nDo recommend this game even in this relatively early stage, and definitely recommend keeping an eye on the game for when new updates come out especially PvE.","June 22, 2015","true","6.5"," 66 of 110 people (60%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","60","66","110","10","2"

I'd like to adress and clear up the issue of p2w first as it seems to be of most intrest to people.\n\nReason why its not p2w:\n\n-The game has factions, and to get armor you need to level up those factions. Ok so how does this make it not p2w you ask? lets go over the details.\n+ First when you start out as level 1 and que for matchmaking, the game reads the level of your gear and puts you into the skill group to play with same level item people. So lets say your level 1 and rank 1 in your faction fresh after installing the game. If you spend lets say....30 dollars on a level 12 advanced faction weapon. You will be put against players in the level 10-12 range. Now to me, being in a match with rank 1 armor and a level 12 weapon is really tough! You may have the killing potential as all the other players, but someone with the same gun but better armor is going to kill you faster. The guns you can buy with real cash give you buffs like 10% silver gained per match or a measly 4% dispersion reduction. Not really enough to be p2w. I feel like the guns that you can buy with cash are designed to be used as an upgraded gun once you hit the level range of that gun. But the gun is by far no means p2w and anyone with a tiny bit more skill then you can easily kill you with the free version (which is not much different).\n\n\nSo overall about the gameplay i really do enjoy it.\nThe sounds are great and are the environments\nit seems you get a more variety of maps towards the higher end levels\nalthough i only just started this game and am unsure of how slow the developement actually is.\n\nBut from my thought, i recommend you at least try it, i mean its free and not that big\nyou'll find that this "p2w" thing is not really as big as people are making it seem\nand 1 shotting ppl with a mosin feels pretty dam good.\n\n\n","April 6, 2015","true","21.4"," 51 of 83 people (61%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","61","51","83","8","0"

This is probably due to most of them being butthurt about freeplay not being a thing yet. In fact, some reviews make it seem like they're dissapointed because the game isn't the game they want it to be rather than reviewing it as the game it is.\n\nThis free to play shooter offer's intresting progression, a couple of twist's on the regular FPS gamplay all while avoiding the P2W model that has destroyed so many FTP games. It's a good ♥♥♥♥ing game all thing's concidered, that's why I think there is somthing wrong with other people's reviews here.\n\nThe net code is a tad off but this will almost never impact your gameplay (it's never impacted mine). Any weapon can become great with the proper upgrades and learning how to use it right, some weapons are a touch more powerful than other's but again I don't see it as a tremendous issue or anything.\n\nDespite all this ♥♥♥♥ being flung by the butthurt community at their good game, Voistok continues to update and patch the game while trying to listen to their hateful community.

Still in a very early beta(0.27).\nMy toughts of this game are really positive.\n\n- This game has a sound quality that u can't imagine, its so beautiful.\n- The maps are very well made, none of the team has like a better spot, the maps are made equaly.\nGraphics are something beautiful if you are interested in it. Still every character has the same voice, face, and movement,\nwe could need some improvements there, not really relevant now.\n- Skill/faction is well made, just one of my thoughts is that, why the first 2 faction have like less armor and weapons?\nThe skills are very good, they arent really too powerfull, they are made just to help you out a little bit.\n- Levels/drops, leveling, well its just a mather of time and/or kills, the more you kill the more you get experience, simple as in every game right?. The random loot drops after every mach are really good balanced, you dont find something unecesary overpowered. You can still find some good stuff on it and/or money.\n\n\nMy personal opinion, I really enjoy playing this game, waiting on more updates, im really into it.

While the TimeToKill was quite short and your situation misjudgement was very unforgiving, the game pace was more slow than fast and there was still room for team effort and tactical play.\n\nNowadays the game's been tuned to play more like brainless, skillless see-first-kill-first any eastern run&gun or CoD clone. TTK is nonexistent, so is teamplay and tactics. Twitch is all that matters... and lag. Infact, makers of Survarium like lag so much, that they literally build lag into the netcode. Nice! To make matters more fun, even tho each player should have the same amount of lag, which is around 200ms (what? Seriously, wtf?), some players will get strong lagshield protection, while others... well, they'll be carefully and accurately screwed. You'll be able to observe this peculiarity yourself, as Survarium has this really nice feature called killcam, with which you can see exactly who and how ended your life, and there you'll see very strange things that looked totally different from your point of view. For instance, you start shooting the badguy as soon as he pops up, but he kills you instantly. Yet on the killcam you see that he's been aiming at you for half a second and then stuffing you with lead for another half a second. Wonderful, isn't it?\n\nSurvarium is also one of the very few games in which a dead guy can still kill you, and I don't mean a grenade that dropped off his hand. You can pop the guy's back with a full mag and after that he can still turn around and kill you, yet on the killcam you see that you actually killed him while he was just turning around... so again, wtf mate? This feature is unofficially called 'tradekill' and I haven't seen this one since the dawn of multiplayer gaming.\n\nThere are actually some really good features in this game, no sarcasm. The sound is absolutely awesome, the graphics is nice, although it was better until devs started to tone it down so the game could run on a microwave, finally the level desing is also brilliant, save for some levels being heavily biased towards one team. However it's all for naught as the current state of the game makes the gameplay anti-fun and highly frustrating. There's massive lag, russian cheaters running all over the place, very strong Pay2Win stench and weapon mechanics that encourages the cheapest, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥gy tricks there can be in an FPS, including the classics like WWI camping and spawnrape festival.\n\nStay clear unless you're a masochistic painlover or selfmutilation enthusiast.","March 27","false","4.7"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","15","18","5","0"

Weiss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MonikaWeiss/","149 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSurvarium is a post-apocalyptic shooter set in eastern Europe after an ecological catastrophe. In the aftermath of the calamity, groups of survivors have banded together to form groups known as Scavengers, The Fringe Settlers, The Black Market and The Renaissance Army. Each side can offer special missions to players which grant them further reputation with that faction.\nAs the name suggests, Survarium will have players choosing sides to fight for a chance at survival in this new hostile environment. Along the way, they’ll encounter anomalies and artifacts which grant special benefits based on the type of radiated matter its found in. Some abilities range from passive movement bonuses, to concealment from player scanners and even the ability to temporarily stop bullets.\nWhile Survarium intends on offering an open world gameplay experience complete with the authentic lone wolf struggle to survive experience, the FPS in its current closed beta state only offers team-play which offers players a quick PvP option on smaller maps. Co-operative PvE missions are also planned, offering players to tackle objectives designed with two players in mind.\nAs players progress in the game they’ll acquire new gear while honing their survival skills in areas such as firearm training, medical skills, and the art of survival.\n","December 19, 2015","true","115.2"," 30 of 47 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","30","47","0","0"

Fun gameplay and interesting way of upgrading gear.  Not sure I like how you are paired for matches though.  Everything was quite even in the beginning and then after upgrading some minor items, I am thrown into matches with enemies with scoped sniper rifles, awesome shotguns, and machine guns that shoot better than sniper rifles at long distances.  The only thing I can think of is there doesn't appear to be a lot of people playing and this allows matches to start quicker, although still slow.\nI do have one thing thats kind of bothering me.  The graphics, they seem like they should be beautiful but somehow seem very grainy.  I turned up my settings to ultra and was getting around 40fps and it seemed to look worse to me.  Went back to medium settings and I get 59fps or higher and it looks better.\nAlso, maybe it's just my lack of knowledge in the game but I cant figure out why I can't purchase some things.

To the point they say; "This faction has an advatage over all other factions".\n\n2) Starting out, no one is playing this game so they do sneaky things. I limited my server to EU since RU had 61 ping, and US had 156 PING (EU had 6). In game, it took 4 min to get others to join, no one joined, so to "fill it up" they pulled a bunch of Russian AFK PALYERS! (Sneaky yet clever move). So me and like 1 other EU guy vs 5 others, as the rest of my team AFK to make rounds look "legit"\n\n\n3) They are trying to balance things out with "open world" that they promised but did not deliver. To do this, they are making "windy foot path maps". Which, honstly, are not half bad. Except made like poo by all other game elements:\n\n3A) Graphics: Pure bard. I run on all ultra and it lijks fuzzy and the animations of "foilage swaying" is odd and makes it look like sometimes a flare of a gun goes off, so you shoot giving away your position...it's just odd and does not feel right, or tactical, since it is easy to spot people always mid range. I guess to put it, sure it is a nice attempt, but it doesn't fit in with teh rest of the game Being more of an annoying distraction than tactical element. I have played older games that get it right. And without distracting foilage, the set ups are dull. Almost every map you know what path the enemy is coming, which leads to camping and spawn camp behavrion.\n\n3b) The gun play: BARF IN A BAG. They hand you all kinds of world war 2 antique like guns to start off as. You get these s side loaded winchester guns and other singe fire, and ♥♥♥♥, guns, which leave the guys with sub machine guns as the best killers on the map. Again, this has to do with the class / faction choice at the start of the game, despite it saying once class has the better advantage due to the "anomly" stuff, CHOOSE THE SUb MACHINE GUN CLASS and rake in mass kills. The rest is uselss.\nThe hit box is so off it is a JOKE! Before uninstalling, I was in this match where I would get shot randomly, and the damage meter said I had 20%HP and my arm was hit. "Hmmm that smells of BS", so to test this, I proped up against a wall like structure only exposing my head, I had a shoot out with a guy across the ravine behind a tree exposing his whole body. As my bullets missed, he of course one shots me. The shot killed me where? IN THE LEG! The only part of my body HE DID NOT HIT! The replay video even showed just my head poke out, he shoot, the head, my leg kills me LOL like WTF is this hit detection?\n"Oh lrn 2 play". So yeah, I aim, get tactical, rush, try all the classic FPS moves, all bullets never connect, I get 1 shot. I try switching my gun to a lesser power ful gun and not caring, (I gave up and said, F it, ill try this gun out since I avoided it since it is weaker, and just run around shooting). I got 2 instant 1 shot kills LOL OH it get's better, so I thought: "Well maybe IT WAS just me, so I will switch back to the better gun". I do, I run across, face to face another guy using same game, WE dance face to face in front of each other, firing like mad, bullets hit, HP starts to lower, we run out of bullets, reload, STOP...just look at each other, like "LOL THIS POS GAME" and he shoots me dead.\n\nThat's it. You seriously don't need any more than one match to find out how poor this game is. I can go about the "anamolies". Thses glowing balls of radiation that have things to pick up in them...they instant kill you and they block major routes. It is their bizzare reward system to make their "PvE" they never had feel more "alive" in pvp...like: "Oh look, see, it is really fall out times, there is a giant death  ball inside". They even say "if you grab the goods inside, and die, it is worth dying for." Like they knew how annoying this thing would be. Also, spamming the pick up button works 50% of the time so while you are trying to pick something up just standing there, you end up DYING without getting the good because the game design is crap.","March 1","false","0.9"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","17","24","3","10"

All of the gear you can get through using real money is worse than the gear you unlock through natural progression. Natural progression is a bit slow, but you can find free exp boosters at the end of each round through the scavenging system.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it's a solid shooter with interesting mechanics such as limb damage that can affect your character's preformance. Weapons are lethal, and you will die very quickly if you're not careful. Armour camo actually works well, and helps you to blend in with your surroundings, offering a very real tactical advantage.\n\nThe only real issue I have with the game is that there are no anti spawn-camping measures. Thus, most TDM matches that you get in will quickly degenerate into a "Which team can spawn camp the hardest" match.","December 14, 2015","true","69.2"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","18","26","2","0"

(There are also some small maps). Lots of little paths to take in each map, lots of little places to find and explore.\n\n-Sounds and Visuals\nI love the weather effects in this game, very atmospheric and really helps to engulf the player in the world of survarium. Turn up the sound and play with headphones :).\nThe game is very rough, but at the same time the sounds and visuals in the game are incredibly tight. Every step, each bullet fired sounds amazing. Smoke, fog and particles in this game look fantastic.\n\n-Lots of guns to play with and each gun plays very unique. No gun is really the same, some are similar but each has its own feel. Earning a new weapon feels satisfying and rewarding.\n\n-The shooting machanics are great: Things like bullet drop and velocity are real, for instance you do less damage per bullet depending on the distance of your target. Shooting through wood or thin walls are also a factor, and I love this about the game. Each round fired from your weapon feels responsive, and landing those hits is very rewarding.\n\n-Unique post-apocalypse atmosphere. A very dark and gloomy future where plants have overgrown the earth...never heard that one before. I like it :) feels almost like stalker or metro 2033 in way.\n\n-Looking for artifacts and using them is fun and feels differnent them most games.\n\n[The Bad]\n-Slow development. Still waiting on lots of features promised a long time ago.\n\n-Slow match-making due to small community (hope steam helps with this)\n\n-Slow grind for end-game gear can take weeks if not months to earn all weapons/gear.\n\n-No free-play(open world game-mode) yet :( (Planned for this year, heres hopeing :))\n\n-Not very well optimized for systems yet, pushes your graphics card and CPU to its limits even on low/medium settings. High system requirements, the listed requirments appear to low.\n\nOverall this game is very enjoyable and I reccomend you try it!","April 2, 2015","true","583.7"," 101 of 181 people (56%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","56","101","181","15","4"

I might not have the best PC, but I got 30 FPS in the main menu and 20-25 in-game. (depends on how big the map is.) And that was all on the lowest settings possible.\n- Premium guns and equipment. Its a F2P game, waddya expect anyway.\n\nThe anomalies seem kinda cool, but everything is poorly explained in the game so half of the time you don't know what to do, like how to stop the bleeding or how the anomalies can help you. This is very annoying for people who are new to Survarium/S.T.A.L.K.E.R in general.\n\nThe gamemodes are the standard run of the mill gamemodes, like TDM, Domination (called Research in this game).\nI honestly expected something better, more creative ideas.\n\nBut you might think: this guy doesn't know ♥♥♥♥, he hasn't even played for 2 hours!\nThat is because it is unplayable for me at the moment.\n\nDon't bother with this game.

The game has been optimized for lower end PCs, and the netlag is significantly less of an issue. The new interface is definitely an improvement over the old. The new weapon customization features are a welcome addition, as you can make your weapon perform to your needs. Certain weapons I feel to be unbalanced, either being too weak, or too strong. Weapon damages are inconsistent, as certain guns shoot the same round, but do very different damages (SOK94 does 50, AKM does 26/Mosin does 100, SVD does 65). These issues can be found in every game, and the developers do work on this. Overall, this game is definitely worth it for any shooter fan, and especially any STALKER fan.\n\nPros\n- STALKER feel\n- Heavy customization (gear and skills)\n- Beautiful maps\n\nCons\n- Occassional Netlag issues\n- Balance issues (Some guns are weaker than they should be, some are blatantly too powerful)\n- Takes awhile to find a match sometimes\n- Occassional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t (Cheaters, Spawnkillers, etc)","March 16","true","45.3"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/suntsuwolf/recommended/355840/","suntsuwolf","Joe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/suntsuwolf/","194 products in account","---A lot of the negative reviews are outdated---\n\nMost of the negative reviews posted  stated that there was only "one game mode" or "the player base is mean". There's 2 game modes now, one a capture the flag, the other basic PvP. Both gametypes are fun to play and easy to understand. Perhaps due to this and the fact the game is freaking FREE, some players that come on arn't the brightest or nicest. But overall most people are quiet and stick to themselves.\n\nPROS:\n-The game has easy, intuitive controls combined with great animations. From walking to reloading, the animations and quality of the graphics are great. The controls feel realistic and adds a great "feel" to walking around, gunning people down in irradiated soviet-esque buildings.\n\n-The scenery is breathtaking in almost every map. As a free to play game this is great! A lot of time and effort seems to have been put into textures and scenery with great glowing hazes around military waste barrels, craters filled with glowing blue ooze, and irradiated reactors. One map even has a great mutated tree, twisted and knarled into the various buildings surrounding it, upon which players scramble to climb to drop down on unsuspecting players.\n\n-Textures. Really, REALLY good textures that can look and run great on low platform computers.\n\n-Hardly any lag. I havn't experienced it one bit and I've got an average connection.\n\n-Factions with very specific weapons and armor, from the all rounder bikers, the extreme lightweight fringe settlers, to the heavy weight Renaissance Army. Each factions comes with a specific skill set and brings it to the table (or face) of the other.\n\n-Money shop is decent. Nothing flying in your face saying "BUY OUR SH*T NOW! LOOK AT THESE PINK $25.00 MITTENS. YOU NEED THEM". If you want some cool weapons you can shell out for them, but there isn't anything game breaking or Pay 2 Win like Planet Side 2. A newbie player with the right mindset can easily take down a better equipped character from the store. Just takes more bullets, and a bullet to the head is still a great equalizer.\n\nCONS:\n\n-Many negative reviews. Not that the game is bad, but people were expecting more and took it to heart to bash the game before it's finalized. Might hurt your experience in-game.\n\n-Little help from players. Not many people respond to "HOW DO I BANDAGE" or "BEAR TRAPS. HOW?". The controls are listed but not very descriptive on what does what. Bandages ad Bear traps are one use items that you PRESS 3 TO USE. Sometimes you have to claw players for answers, but it's honestly easy to figure out with a little button pressing.\n\n-2 Game types, both of which arn't the previously advertised "mmo". It's not really that bad, but for the moment if you came looking for that "STALKER MMO THAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT" you'll be slightly disappointed to know it's not quite here yet.\n\nFINAL: Great Game.\n\nWill be a lot better when freeplay comes out (the open world mmo part), while sparse in diversity atm, this game will grow to be great. The controls, scenery, factions, gametypes, and animations are great and have a lot of hard work put into them. Give the game a try and see for yourself, it's free after all.","April 4, 2015","true","18.5"," 28 of 46 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","28","46","0","0"

This is such a cool beta game. Not only does it combine the call of duty feel with a post apocalyptic world, but it is also similar to another game that i liked called Stalker. Even though this game is in beta, i find this game to be almost as addictive as crack. I have only had and played the game for 2 days and already have 25 hours on it. I also like the fact that the game looks freaking amazing, but yet my media pc can still run it on the high end pc setting. A couple of problems and my solutions to these problems (I will start with the minor problem and then work my way up). The first thing is that the scope menu is in the way of the actual scope. Once again, its a beta, so this will probably get fixed in the future. Now on to the things that bug me. First of all, i feel like they could add in the leaning feature, like whats in dayz, unturned and call of duty for example. Now dont get me wrong, this game is a complete master of immersion, with there being many buildings, cracks and crevices to hide in, but i feel like if the game developers were to add in this feature, it would make the game just that more awesome. My other problem is with the hackers. I know that the devs have fixed this problem and banned some 200 users in 2015, but for some reason they started to pop back up again. However, as i said about 3 times now, the game is a beta, so it will probably get fixed. My last problem is with the actual pairing up system for the games. It seemed like when i first started off in the game, i was getting matched up to level 4 scavengers and level 3 black markets. It just makes the game hard for all of the newcomers to try and get off of there feet in the first few games because they are constantly getting killed by these higher tiered players. In my mind, however, all of these cons are extremely outwieghed by the pros, which i have kind of already expressed earlier. All in all, is this game perfect; no, it could use some work. Would i recomend this game to someone; hell yes! And if i had to give this game a rating, i would honestly give this game 4.5/5 stars. So if you made it this far, thank you for reading my review that possibly has misspelling mistakes riddled through it. Lets hope the devs see our reviews and works on some of these problems.

When the starter packs were available in 2014, just before the first external alpha, I bought one.  I played this game for at least 60 hours.  It was unfinished, but playable and fun.  I can't say that today.  This game has taken so many steps back from the initial alphas.  Yes, it's prettier than it was.  It's a little smoother, but that's it.  The gameplay, the weapons, the matchmaking system, have all taken huge steps back.  It's clunkier than ever which is very sad.  I can't recommend this game in it's current state.  A year ago, that was a different story.","January 25","false","1.5"," 27 of 45 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","27","45","0","0"

This game could be good if the NA servers didn't resync you 30 times a match and i wish i was exaggerating. So forced to play RU and EU servers with over 200 ping and  170 ping to avoid resync. Game loves to kick you at the end of matches right before drops so you get absolutely nothing for putting up with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Immortal-Warlord/recommended/355840/","Immortal-Warlord","Immortal Warlord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Immortal-Warlord/","24 products in account","Well for starts, try the game. It is vary good and well made and definatly can be the right game for you. Now on to more detail. This game is probably one of the most addictive fps, rpg, multiplay actions ive experianced in awhile. At the time of writting this review i have even taken notes on this game and done videos and have already posted one on youtube, check it out if you want to see how this game plays. struggles of rifles- Survarium\n\nThe enviorments are stunning, the graphics are unique and even help give the game a dark, desolight, grim wastland feel to your gaming experiance.\n\nGuns, Practicaly give a you a relistic feel while your at picking off the enamy from 49 Meters away with a high caliber rifle, or creaping around a corner with your smg ready to unload into anyone who dares peak their head out. Almost life like on on that.\n\nArmor, The armor and cloths in this game are set and created so well to make you feel like a mercenary higherd to take out as many punks the get in your way, wearing heavy leather and metal plates. Slow yes, can he take damage? ask the guy who caught a deer slug from him. He'll tell ya. Or a hunter who loots what ever he can find value in, moves with alot equipment yet is still silent and fast, unseen from a distance and fast when he is close. Also on top of it you can customize your armor and cloths to have different paints and decals of the faction for whom you have sided with.\n\nAllegiance, You can choose your faction of your choosing, for the weapons, armor, and cloths (including paints and decals) as you climb up their ladder of ranks. you will earn the iteams that come with that rank. There are 4 factions at the moment. The scavengers, light weight troops who can carry alot and pick you off as quick as they can see you if your not careful, Their counter part, The black market. A group that uses heavy armor and big bullets you solve their problems. From there their is the next set of 2, The fringe settlers and The Army. The fringe settlers seem to be more reliant on dirty tactics, light armor, but hard hitting weapons, and the army seem to use heavy armor with rifles with nice distance and rate of fire.\n\nThe skills, in the skill tre there are many skills and branches that you can gain to better your odds of the tactic you most commonly use of working. From lunatic run and gun, to stealth and silence, to snipe and hide. From there down the road there are things like survival skills and trap making etc. I my self have taken a favor in the sniper side of thinks, i can hold my breath long, sight in fast, and ♥♥♥♥ my gun as fast as the bullet leaves the chamber.\n\nNot even close to pay to win. This game has vary few things you can actually but in person it almost feels like the devlopers and creaters wanted to make a master peice they wanted to see people enjoy. One that i myself say if you get this instead of buying the weapons with your money buy a decal, a flag, a paint that best suites you, or a unique booster or boosters, to show how you enjoy and oppresiate what they have done for you and this game in a whole.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTime for the down falls.\n\nThis game like i said is amazing. Practically adding new genre of games like Day Z. Mixing survival horror, mmorpg, pvp, and a open arms market to rig up your guy for any types of fights. Why could be wrong with this you may ask? well...\n\n\nThe Fps and ping isssiues, This is a common issiue for me and i myself have no idea why. My internet functions at light speeds for every game i have came across. I first thought it was a issiue with graphics. but that wouldnt make sence seeign how the 2 videos i did had been on medium settings and flew at a healthy 35-40 with a ping of 30-50. Now my game has slowly fell into a fps of 16-20 and a ping of 80- 128.\n\nThe starting errors. A bug that doesnt know when to stop. It comes at random and practically crips my computer to the point where i have to ctrl alt del for what feels like 100 times until it finally allows me to exit from the game. This bug is highly annoying and from the looks of the general chat "which the bug doent allow you to type in the chat so your only allowed to read" Im not the only person who suffers from this.\n\nThe whisper of a crash. I name this. This is another bug that was kinda creepy and only sufferd it once yet was something i sorta dont want to see again for how strange and unsettaling it was. I went to start a match. It then told me it had found one. My character seemed to blink in and out of reality on the customization room and a static like noise dull in the background. Then the game crashed without even giving me a error report as if nothing happened. This should be investigated for i myself have no clue what it was.\n\nLastly the community. Something that i know alot of people are going uptight about but in all honesty i dont care. This needs to be addressed, not just for this game but all games. It seems like the gaming community has 1-2 types of people who have mass produced onto no just this but literally all games i play. Boarderline cardboard cut outs of each other. First the 12 year old group who play alot of Call of Duty. The ones who if you give a mic tend to scream hacker, and camper, and alot of cuss words that at times i believe they dont actually know the meaning of and even how to use them. The group that takes pride in annoying fellow memebers of there squads for literally no reason besides no one told them to play something else. Or even better for that age outside. And group 2. The groupi myself despise most. The "you mad bro" kids this group commonly merges, comes from, and intertwines with the 12 year olds  who yell and scream alot. But now this 12 year old ranges from 13- 25, and is more annoying. Being so unsociable that i assume they have aspergers i tend to not talk to these people. But yet still manage to annoy me and at times innsult me while i am trying to snipe people. These are the same people who think there cool at school and say things like "yo bro" "got swag brah?" (But i digres i have met some vary nice, funny, smart, and kind people along the way. So i am not saying this is the only community.) Just a unhealthy bite.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSo for the final verdict This wasnt even tough. This game earned this from its obvious hard work and effert. 8.5 out of 10 and once the bugs are fixed then is game will stand at a tall and even note worthy 9 out of 10. Thank you for reading this. if this helped you you can check out my youtube channle name Immortal Warlord.

Not every negative review is going to be inept and I respect someone's right not to like a game.\n\nWhile this game has problems they do not make this game a bad one. There are bugs (some brand new) that pop up, some of which are extremely annoying but not game breaking. Most guns do real damage in the game. While some guns need some tweaking (being more accurate than their real world counterparts) I hesitate to say any gun is truly OP. The premium guns are not P2W (extra ammo in a clip being the very minor exception). IMO all guns should be killers. So if anything, some guns are under powered. Pistol seem a bit weak, for instance.\n\nThe maps are mostly just the right size for P2P shooter.  They should create a spawn zone so that bullets cannot do damage either coming in or going out of the protected zone.  At least they have a small safety period when you spawn so you can't be shot. It's my opinion that a team that works together can defend the spawn and push the enemy back. Hence the importance of squads and voip in this game.\n\nAfter reading up on the future plans for this game I must say that the devs are very thoughtful about what they are trying to do. I hope they get around to improving the graphics in this game as it looks like an older game sometimes. I"m sure it's on their minds. They really seem care about this game and the people who play it. They also respond to my support tickets when a response is warranted.  I'm amazed at how patient they are with angry players, sometimes diffusing a player's anger with polite and honest answers.\n\nAs for hacks and cheats, every well known MP game is going to be under attack. I've personally seen at least one that I'm certain of.  VG doesn't make you jump thru hoops to report problem players; they consider reports seriously and take care of the offenders quickly, unlike some Devs who take weeks or months (if at all) to deal with reported cheaters and other problem players. I've experienced this personally.","May 22, 2015","true","196.5"," 27 of 46 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","27","46","0","0"

Fans of some-kind-of-realism will love it, but i prefer health regeneration so it was uncomfortable for me.\nAll buyble equipment, (and maybe, dunno for sure, perks) can be purchase for real money. And trust me- you better buy everything what you need unless you wanna spend hundreds of hours grinding little pieces of ingame money.\nCouple things what i'll love to see in this game: Tutorial was great, especially explanation of controls in a first deathmatch. Those things saved me a lot of time.\nSo at additional it would be fantastic to see some special training maps with explanations, what could high up skill of player, to give him additional helpful information about gameplay mechanics, best strategies, places for practice, all the things what could make a real competitive player.\nKillCam. Remember this Call of Duty feature? Add this in game.\nDeathhud need information about,how much health your killer is have after your death, did he injured/ maimed somehow, what equipment and perks he have.\nLots of options for player; What map he wants to play, mods, equipments, bleeding, bonebreaking, all this checkboxes, radiobuttons, tiny scrollers, all this required to have good feelings from game. This is a part of customisation.\nA much more obvious, intuitive understandable interface. In Windows 8, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome style as example. I personally was been confused, when i saw hard-to-reach weapons, and equipment what you have to drag and drop to your inventory.\nMore Loadout/weapon preference slots. 3 is max, by default you have only 2, and 3rd is for real money. Faster time to switch between them, 'cuz at this moment it is stuttering. Ability to copy-and-paste slot.\nMore stuff to do, what's make me happy. Gameplay mods, cool maps, interesting perks.\nI don't like ironsights of UZI. So hard too see through them. Gimme better ironsights and scope and laserrrocket launcher! :D\n\nПервые впечатления от игры.\nЭто мультиплеерный шутер, с смотри-в-прицел, чтобы-точнее-стрелять геймлеем, покупаемым снаряжением, развиваемыми перками, отсутствием регенерации здоровья, и пока одним геймплейным модом.\nЭто командный бой.\nСтрельба в аккуратно проработанных, насыщенных "нычками", разными местами для прострелов, картах, основанных на территории СНГ, с сай-фай акцентом от СТАЛКЕР'а - кусающиеся аномалии, интересные погодные проделки, радиация, кровотечение и прочие приколюхи.\n\nПара вещей: Когда кто-то стреляет в тебя, есть хороший шанс потерять всю кровь и погибнуть. Фанатам как-то-реализма очень понравится, но я предпочитаю регенерацию здоровья, поэтому мне было некомфортно.\nВсё покупное снаряжение, (и может быть, перки, не знаю точно) могут быть приобретены за реальные деньги. И доверьтесь мне, лучше купить всё необходимое, если только вы не хотите тратить сотни часов для фарма грошей для игровой валюты.\nПара вещей, которые мне тааак хочется увидеть в игре: Обучение было замечательным, особенно объяснение клавиш управления в первом дефматче. Эти вещи сэкономили мне много времени.\nЕщё было бы чудесно увидеть несколько специальных обучающих карт, с объяснениями, чтобы увеличить скилл игрока, дополнительная информация про механику геймплея, лучшие стратегии, спецместа для практики, все те вещи, что могут сделать настоящего конкурентоспособного спортсмена.\nKillCam. Помните эту штуку из Call of Duty? Добавьте её в игру.\nDeathhud'у нужно больше информации о том, сколько осталось у вашего убийцы здоровья, после вашей смерти; ранен/ покалечен ли он, какое у него снаряжение и перки.\nБольше опций для игрока; На каких картах он хочет играть, с какими модами, снаряжением, будет ли кровотечение,  переломы, все эти вкл/выкл, радиокнопки, слайдеры, нужны для получения хорошего чувства от игры. Это часть кастомизации.\nБолее очевидный, интуитивно понятный интерфейс. В стиле Windows 8, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, например. Я лично был в замешательстве, когда увидел огнестрел и прочий лут, до которого долго добираться и надо перетягивать на свой инвентарь.\nБольше слотов для оружейных профилей. 3- это максимум, по умолчанию есть только 2, и 3-й за реальные деньги. Переключение между профилями заедает, плохо реагирует на переключения. Нужна возможно скопировать профиль.\nБольше вещей, чем можно заняться, возможностей, что сделают меня счастливей. Геймплейные моды, классные карты, интересные перки.\nМне не нравится прицел и мушка у УЗИ. Так трудно видеть через них. Дайте мне лучший прицел, оптический, а ещё Пыщь-пыщь рокет ланчер! :D","April 8, 2015","true","2.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NikolaT/recommended/355840/","NikolaT","Nikola","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NikolaT/","97 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSurvarium is a match based FPS game currently in beta testing.\n\nThe atmosphere of Survairum will be immediately familiar to people who have played the STALKER and metro games, as they share a similar vision and many of the same elements.\n\nThe gameplay at the moment is in the form of 5v5 matches based on the tier of your gear, and based on 4 different game modes, most of them are pretty standard like ctf, team deathmatch and conquest, but there is a free for all game mode which is actually pretty interesting. There is a freeplay game mode in the works that was promised for the end of 2015, although no one really knows when it will be released.\n\nNot too many people are playing Survarium right now, and so matches can take a while to find, usually 3 minutes or so. You can speed this up by playing on all of the servers around the world, but if you do latency can become a BIG problem for you.\n\nThe quality of the visuals is somewhere between STALKER and Metro 2033, better in some areas than STALKER, worse than metro. Overall I think this game looks pretty good, and many of the maps are beautifully designed.\n\nThe game features a gear customization system that is satisfactory, with enough gear slots to make me feel like I have a good degree of control over how my character looks. There are also camos you can put on your clothes and decals you can put anywhere.\n\nOverall, this game is pretty good for a beta, the business model so far has been good, and I dont feel like its really pay to win at all, and its one of the few games out there I know of that really feels like STALKER. Jerky player movement and lag can be a problem, but the next patch is supposed to help with that.","December 16, 2015","true","97.3"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Devs seem to put much effort in the game. I've had a one year brake and came back to see loads of things improved, new content added.\n\nBut there is a downside. Thing that for me, is making this game unplayable. The lags. With ping 60-200 it's constantly lagging. There are grotesque things happening like; you shoot a man, the ragdoll falls to the ground, then disappears and the same guy shoots you in the back, or you score a lethal hit, he is lying there dead, but hey, I didn't get a score.

(Just my opinion) This review is also for the people who are going to play this for the first time.\n\nFirst of all, The Pros:-\n*The game is visually Amazing. Stunning graphics, Amazing lighting And a beautiful Environment. Overall, the game looks absolutly beautiful for a Free to paly game.\n*The game has Seriously amazing sounds.\n*The maps playable in the game are gorgeous. For the right amount of players in a mtach, Each and every map is fun.\n*The stock wepons you get are awesome, Its the perfect wepons to start your first matches in Survarium\n*The Faction system makes the game even better, each factions have its own rules and equipments.\n*Clan and squad concept.\n*Character skill system is wonderful and evenly distributed.\n*There are alot of patches incoming everyday or every 2 days, and to be honest, the patch makes game more playable and fun everytime.\n*Tactic - This is not COD. Seriously, it has much more stuff than shooting. I cant name it all.\n\nNow for the cons:-\n*Lag. The game is really laggy even though there are fairly alot of servers.\n*Horrably Balanced. The matchmaking is Seriously not balanced at all.\n*Gameplay is not smooth at all, with the lag its almost unplayable.\n*Some wepons are the same, like there is not much difference between VSS and VSSK\n*Team killing, yeah, this still exists and there is no punishment for doing so yet in the game.\n*Spawn Camping. Game has nothing protect ourselfs from spawn campers.\n*No prone .-. Seriously, there is snipeing. But cant prone.\n*Game is really, really not optimized. For most of the players, Even with highend hardwares, its really laggy and not smooth enogh to play.\n\nSo 9 Pros and 8 Cons from my side. I do recomend this game Mainly because the game is still in beta version and most of the cons can be fixed with upcoming releases.\nI'd give it 6/10 for now ;D","April 20, 2015","true","17.2"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","12","19","2","0"

Repair costs and ammo are charged against your earnings. sound familiar?\n\nThe game is an arena at present two teams try to eliminate the most enemy or control the resources in a given time. Friendly fire is on. The maps are well thought out and very pretty to see. There are anomalies on these maps that are a hazard or a benefit if you can farm them. At the end of the game you get to loot a stash as a reward this may be anything from an emblem to go on your clothing to money, a gun or gear. As you play you gain character levels giving perks that improve your personal performance. You also gain rep that allows you to buy better gear and weapons with a faction.\nYou can also mod weapons and gear by spending roubles and parts from items you dismantle.\nIf you spend gold instead of roubles to mod an item success is a certainty. Mods are randomly determined and of random value between a range of values.\n\nFreeplay and PVE variants have been promised forever but there is not much point picking up the game with an expectation of these modes at present.\n\nRep Level 0-4 was a blast I had great fun learning the game.\nRep Level 5 and it all changes it gets faster and more aggressive and often you feel out geared and gunned.\nI am at rep level 8 and losing an average of 1000 roubles a match. I am not a great player but the chances of progressing without a premium account, buying gold or goodies at this point are slim and slow.\n\nReal money can be spent on gold and on guns. Gold can be spent on guns and gear to help you progress. Golden weapons are generally resented and not only have a reload advantage they gain experience for the user at a higher rate. Gear bought with gold has an experience mod on it as well.\n\nSince 29A was released servers are now split into North America, Russia and EU. The European servers are full of Russians and full of hackers. Since I wrote this real efforts have been made by VG to alliviate the issue and ban those caught.\nThis was not prevalent until the server separation. I cant speak for the American or Russian servers, but doubt they are fairing any better.\n\nVG have an obsession with machine pistols and for some reason known only to themselves have made them high level, almost impossible to miss with and given them excessive range and the only downside is err...Lower level plavers get very frustrated being shot up with guns which can match their sniper rifles for accuracy, have better armour penetration and shoot 900rpm all with a 9mm pistol round. Oh did I mention they are suppressed as well. The game can feel like a bunny shoot where you are the bunny at times. Whatever arcane system matchmaking uses it can be absurdly unbalenced.\n\nLeague matches are currently being played where players are rated in matches and move up or down leagues dependant on their score. if you finish in a higher league you get better loot at the end. I missed the last leagues but the reward for the players who killed the most was ofc an even better surpressed machine pistol. Please explain the logic...\n\nIf you choose to play expect your fun to be spoilt for a proportion of your matches by those who will know exactly where you are and who don't miss. They will try to bottle you up in your spawn.\nRegardless of the gear you are in you cannot do well in this situation.\nMy honest belief is endemic hacking will destroy the player base and lack of evidence of further development of the game to a free play PVE mode is already disappointing many of the long term supporters of the project. This would be a great shame as what is promised has great potential.\n\nThe next upgrade is upon us 0.30a The game is less stable and crashes more often both on load and randomly. Starting the game either in spectator mode or with a black screen is an innovation I doubt VG intended. So along with the nailbiting is the game going to crash and deprive me of my loot the low level sniper rifles have been nerfed and there is a new I WIN button a Barrett anti material rifle you can run into opponants shooting barrets from the hip.\nThe good guns are now so ridiculous as to make the game a bunny shoot for those at rep level ten.\nWhen you shoot someone at range with a sniper rifle 3 times and they kill you with a machine pistol you really know the physics (or logic) is out of control.\nI can no longer report cheaters as my complaints are all used up. Another compelling reason to give up on the game. VG have banned several hundred cheaters and have scraped the surface of the problem, but certainly not fixed it. Nor will they by stopping them being reported. EDIT: This was apparently not deliberate and has been turned back on.\n\n0.42A is with us and I wonder why I still play. The game is a lot and I mean a lot shinier,and rarely crashes but real issues are still not being addressed. Cheating is really bad at present and random sync/lag issues are making some matches unplayable. Match making is poor in getting a balence and a lot of matches are a rout. The league is currently on and cheats are running amok to get the ranks. The game is unplayable for the next couple of weeks as to gain a league position requires 5 wins with a loss knocking you back down a point. I am maybe seeing 1 win in five and idiocy like one squad of three getting 90% of the kills in a match. some games almost no kills to 15 deaths then a good one back to 13-8. Variance like this was unusual in the past. Now certain players can stop running aim and kill you before you can shoot an aimed gun.\nVG keep saying how effective anticheat is instead of addressing the fact that a sizeable minority of players are ruining the game and being rewarded for doing so.\n\nI would really love to be able to recommend the game and hope to do so at some point in the future when the necessary fixes and anticheat are in place and promised development has occurred. Reality is cheating is endemic and likely always will be and the developers are more interested in making it shiny than making it work.","June 22, 2015","false","357.8"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","14","23","2","0"

It is Free to Play, but unlike most F2P games, it's also Free to Enjoy. I haven't put too many hours into it yet as I installed it the day of writing this, but I  definitely will. It's matches are short (about 10 minutes) bvut packed with action. You pick your play style by using a loadout system. For example, my current loadouts are a Mosin Nagant (free when you start playing, 1 shot to the torso) and a handgun, and an Uzi with a handgun. After death, you can switch which loadout you're using, so if you get bored of sneaking and long-range combat, you can easily witch to a run-n-gun style. I will not EVER put money into this game, and as I see it now, that won't effect how I enjoy the game. One of the features that is supposed to get you so hand over cash I actually ENJOY being in the game: If you get shot for a large amount of damage, you'll bleed out over time. If you still have 25% HP, you'll live, but it is very easy to be injured fatally.\n\nThe game is beautiful, well optimized, and fun. 8/10.","April 11, 2015","true","7.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xgrishin/recommended/355840/","xgrishin","grishin.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xgrishin/","166 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSurvarium is an attempt at reviving the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series, which they are doing in an MMOFPS format. This attempt is a brave one and so far the game is decent for a beta.\n\nWhen you first login, you go through a little tutorial that shows you the very basics of Survarium. After the tutorial you choose either the Scavangers or the Black Market faction. Once one of these factions is at level five, you can then start progressing into the other two factions: The Renaissance Army and The Fringe Settlers. You can switch between these factions at any time and in next update there will be no prerequisite to join the other two factions. Each faction has its own unique gear you can unlock and buy with the regular in-game currency, which is Rubles. Gear can also be attained via random drop at the end of a match.\n\nSeparate from faction levels, there are also character levels. Each level you will need 250XP more than the previous, to advance to the next level. Each time you level up, you get a skill point which can be put into the two available skill trees. There will be a total of five skill trees in the future. Currently, the maximum character level that can be attained is 100, however, when the other three skill trees become available, this number will increase to 500.\n\nCurrently there is one game mode called "PVP" which hosts 16 players in total, two teams of eight. This PVP game mode has three sub-modes in it which are:\nProtective Device (Capture the flag spin-off)\nTeam Deathmatch (Self-explanatory)\nResearch (Conquest-type game mode with three capturable objectives)There are plans to introduce “free game” mode which will feature a large-scale map. Co-op modes have also been confirmed. All game modes are session-based and will not feature hundreds of players on one map. I’m not sure how I feel about this but I have confidence that Vostok Games will do it right.\n\nFree-to-Play model\nThere are quite a few people that think this game is pay-to-win. I’m not going to say they are right or wrong but I will give my honest opinion on it.\n\nThe premium-account provides you with one extra profile slot, +50% experience boost towards character level, +50% reputation towards faction rank, and +50% Rubles income from matches.\n\nPremium itself is actually fairly cheap. One-year premium is 5,000 gold, which is $50 USD. This is quite reasonable considering your average MMO subscription fee is $15 USD a month which would end up around $180 USD per annum. Mind you, you do not have to buy a year at a time. You can purchase premium in increments of 24 hours, three days, a week, a month, three months, six months or the year mentioned before. So far I purchased three-day premium once for 120 gold which translates into $1.20 USD.\n\nPremium guns however, are quite expensive and don’t offer any advantage that is worth that price. Premium guns do not alter damage of the weapon but have boosts like +10% fire rate or +10% reload speed. I think this is a quite reasonable approach to combat the pay-to-win stereotypes.\n\nI should also mention that without spending any real money, you can get these same +10% boosts on your weapons by upgrading them. They just won’t have the skins that the premium guns do.\n\nVerdict\nOverall, this is a humble approach to a free-to-play MMOFPS. If you are expecting a polished game then you will be disappointed, but if you embrace the fact that this is still a beta, with a small development team which for the time being will mean a long development process, then you just might enjoy it.\n\nSurvarium is worth a try, it is free after all and it deserves more people in its community. Go ahead and install it. What’s the worst that will happen? You’ll actually like the game?","April 8, 2015","true","79.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Accuracy is very iffy and the damage mechanics are weird. You can hit someone dead on with a Mosin and they can shrug it off while killing you instantly with an SMG. Those are my main complaints though. I would like to see a larger variety in armor and weapons that you can buy without having to rank up or pay money, but I am sure that is in the works.

The war for the donetsk region of Ukraine still rages on, even though the world has gone to bitter ♥♥♥♥. Due to radiation, and the decrease of population in both sides, they have taken part in something straight out of a science fiction novel.\nTo continue the conflict, both sides have taken part to an illegal cloning project, which has spun out of control. The cloning produces millions, upon millions of middle aged men. And due to a unfortunate mishappening, each clone came with a copy of a Mosine and a Ppsh-41. With the coming uprising, the clones have taken control of both Ukraine Parliament, and Donetsk's Parliament.\nWith the end of the old world governments, you would think that both sides could come to an agreement, but no. Old grudges never go away. They declare war on each other, and send all their forces to attack each other. That's where you, the player, come in.\n\n\nYou take control of one of these mindless clones. You start out with a wool sweater, a PPSH-41, a Mosine, and a TT-34 for your sidearm. Unfortunely, your clone doesn't not come with a voice box, so you can not communicate with your allies vocally. You need to use hand signals to be able to communicate with them.\n\n\nThe combat is unique, accurately depicting the true struggles in the Ukrainian conflict. Everyone looks the same. Both sides have the same weapons, and the same sweaters. It's just like the real life counterpart, having both sides shoot each other while they have the same uniforms and weapons.\nShooting people isn't too hard, as each time you win a round you 'level up'. This means you are able augment your clone in to a type of super soldier unseen in modern warfare.\nDying isn't also a pain either, as each time you die a cloaked Matter Replicator brings a new you back to life to fight again.\n\nThe shop in game allows you to exchange US currency to a type of digital gold, to russian rubles. You can use the digital gold/rubles to further augment your clone, buy old world weapons/armor, or buy flags (Such as USSR, Russian Federation, Russian Seperatists, Ukraine, etc.). It is unknown in the story where the supplies come from, but the developers have hinted that Russia is supplying the clones. It has yet to be confirmed or canon.\n\nMy personal opinion is that it's an alright game depicting real life events, and a scenario which can happen in the future.\nThe clone I currently own is a level 20 Commissar, equipped with a gasmask linked to a gasoline canister, so that I can inhale the gas fumes and have supersoldier strength.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who wants to see what it is like fighting on the front lines of the Ukraine Civil War. Thank you for this beautiful game.\n\nEDIT:\nA hardship I forgot to mention in my review is that the clones are constantly bullied by russian millionaries, trying to peer pressure them in to buying a gun worth 60 CAD just to not be called a "poor-♥♥♥".\nhttps://a.pomf.se/sbjgob.png\nhttps://a.pomf.se/vglewr.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeriously don't even consider playing this game","May 5, 2015","true","57.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","9","14","3","0"

So, sit down, buckle up, and geta  coffee.\n\nExecutive summary:\nIn this review I hope to explore some of the major pros and cons comparatively through the year life span i've been playing Survarium. From closed Russian-only server beta, to, now, Steam release. I hope to explore, in some depth, how mechanics have evolved over time, how Vostok has added additional content over time, how they've chosen to balance the game over time, and how they've slowly begun to monetize the "F2P" model. I sincerely hope this helps other players, old and new, in their perception of Sarvarium going forward, to, hopefully, a fully released, polished, and complete game.\n\nSome background.\nI found this game after seeing some sparse reddit posts on the STALKER sub about a "spiritual successor." Well before we saw that obvious scam with that other one, I saw Sarvarium. It had the look and feel of STALKER, it had a working beta game play, and, well, looked legit. So, I signed up for the lotto, and, after a few weeks, received my beta key. When I started the game, the top level was Equip 12, or whatever. Overall, it was people running around with old Soviet machine guns mowing people down. With some sparse attempts, by players, at a slower, more calculated game play with rifles. (This hasn't changed one bit, mind you.) I advanced through the player levels rather quickly until I hit lv30, when I slowed down. Back then, there were few Russians at lv100, and they were top rankers who grind all day.\n\nThroughout they've added more guns, and more equipment levels. It was until a few months ago they revamped the character leveling (skill) tree. In my opinion, this was a big welcome as the old system was, to be honest, rudimentary. Although much to a large dedicated player base of International and Russian and Ukrainian player's bemuse. Many were calling for a total revamp how match making worked at the fundamental level. Instead of adding more tiers of equipment levels, we wanted them condensed; refined, even. Instead of of the game system making the distinction, much of the community was split on whether or not to include things like rank, player level, and equipment level. In my opinion, the game should *never* put someone with top tier equips into a match with the lowest tier guns/armours. Ever. Period. Yet, it does. Even when there are seemingly enough people on at a certain level where it could match someone up with same/similar-leveled characters and equips.\n\nSpeaking of equipment, and balance in general: I like that, the higher one progresses in ranks, the more access one has to with armour/pockets for items, more artifact slots, and more mag pouches. However, I feel there has not been enough focus on the consequences of overloading the avatar. I have been outpaced, as a 23kg/45+kg with +5% movement speed boots and pants, with high stamina regen +%% and lower energy costs modifcations on pants and boots, and in the character level - by a player with full Zubr equips, PKP, huge backpacks, and, enough stuff on them to be close to, or over burdened. Now I don't know these player's character screens; if they're lv100, have "perfect" mods on everything for speed/movement, that's one thing, but generally, this shouldn't happen. I'm not complaining in as much as pleading a argument for refinement of game play: Less time spent trying to make money off the player base, and adding new content, and more time really refining a solid gameplay support structure to build new content off of.\n\nSurvarium devs need money to further develop the game; I get it, it makes sense. But I don't like it's sacrificing it's potential on becoming another vanilla PvP arcade shooter with a STALKER-isk atmosphere. This game idea has a lot of potential to revolutionize how we, as lovers of PvP shooters with RPG elements think and approach the genre.\n\nOn the topic of communication from Vostok with the fans, it has often been said that we lack a good outlet to voice our opinions, and air grievances about direction. If what they say is true that they value community input, communication lines need to stay open and fair-minded. Instead we have community managers that, for the most part, say: "It's in the works." or "Vostok are considering what you (the community) have been saying." or "It's your problem, not ours." Or, or... or... so many other *deflections.* Community managers should be (mostly neutral) liaisons between community members and the devs, not spoke-persons for the devs. They should communicate directly with concentrated efforts about what the Devs are thinking and considering, explicitly, and vise-versa. Instead of just spouting more, "it's going according to (Vostok's) plan. Nothing to see here." "There is a language barrier, Vostok being from Ukraine, and Russian-speakers, and the rest of the community." Isn't a valid excuse. This is 2015, we have means of translation. So, translate for us!\n\nIn conclusion:\nThis game needs further refinement of it's core game play mechanics. It doesn't need new content *right now,* it needs balance. This is what Survarium suffers from the most; it isn't new content, it isn't monetization of "pay to advance faster," it's focus on balance and refinement. I recommend this game, although reluctantly; it has lots of solid potential, and, in my opinion, it's at a crossroads in development. It will be interesting to see where it goes.","April 7, 2015","true","178.2"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","18","32","3","0"

Its ultimate goal is to become an MMOFPS, with similar atmosphere and setting to STALKER. That said, don't come into this game expecting STALKER. It's solely PVP, there are no monsters, the weapons are varied but hard to get (think more like how armor was distributed in the STALKER series). However, what's present in Survarium clearly benefits from the quirks and philosophy of the original team.\n\nThe game is an intense, thoughtful multiplayer shooter with a heavy emphasis on positioning, hiding/camouflage, resource management, and smart play. Teamwork and patience are greatly rewarded. The maps are huge, each containing 2-5 discrete areas that could, in another game, be a full map. Long-range combat is common and satisfying.\n\nThe graphics are technically so-so, but the effect is greater than the sum of its parts. The world is lush with foliage, and the lighting, while inconsistent, sometimes comes together to create some of the most immersive environments in gaming. I've never felt more aware or concerned with camouflage in a game, and finding a good sniper spot or route through cover feels completely instinctual. The sound is PHENOMENAL.\n\nSurvarium is free-to-play, so there's a good amount of weapons and armor and so forth that you can pay real money for, but I haven't felt unfairly outclassed by a paying player yet. The atmosphere is currently "daytime, clear skies," which is a little disappointing. It would do great with weather effects, more time-of-day variety, etc.\n\nThe bottom line is that this game is a great distillation of STALKER's human v. human combat, with a lot of potential improvements to come. Give it a shot.","April 13, 2015","true","9.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The gameplay and weaponhandling feels a bit like old call of duty games but a bit more tactical. the maps are cool. They are well designed and have potential to give some great fights and classic matches. The atmosphere is great also and gives you a good, authentic post-apocalypse, stalker-like feeling. But the best of all: the character development features and dashmap feature. To have the opportunity to find some great new weapons or armors is very cool and motivating. Overall i would say the game has GREAT potential.\n\nContra: Some weapons are a bit unbalanced at this point. The performance requirements are way too high for a shooter like this in my opinion. Even at the lowest settings I got poor framerates, an my computer is not that worse. I can play most of the current games fine on mid - high settings with stable framerates. But suvarium unfortunately, brings my computer down on the knees.\nOn the one hand a bunch of weapon sounds are AMAZING and feel damn realistic. On the other hand, some other weapons sound completly unrealistic (for example some shotguns and granades) and the sound just does not fit to the gun. I really hope that the developers will fix this from time to time.\nAlso I got the feeling that sometimes the hitboxes or hit-feedback is not the best at all. But I dont know if its the hit feedback or my bad aiming skills haha. I just get the feeling that something could be better and smoother here.\n\nBut overall. The features are very cool and have very very much potential! If the developer could fix those "problems" and fill the last empty gaps in this game, it could become a really really good multiplayer shooter. For me personaly its already one of my favorites !\n\n","February 8","true","37.5"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

Right now, there's only PvP (Team Deathmatch, Research, Battery Retrieval) available, with other modes like Freeplay PvE and co-op modes planned for the future. The matches take place in the sort of bleak environments you'd expect: scarred landscapes with crumbling rock walls, ruined buildings, abandoned vehicles, and overgrown vegetation.\n\nThe game looks pretty good. The character models are fairly plain and the animations aren't particularly well done, but I like the look and atmosphere of the world itself. None of it really feels too much like a Stalker game, except for the anomalous areas of the map, which are extremely hazardous to blunder into and made me wish I could stop the match, shoulder my rifle, get out an artifact detector, and hunt for a Night Star or a Moonlight or a Mama's Beads.\n\nAs for combat, the guns are loud and startling and bullets quickly shred you to pieces. It's the sort of quick-death scenario that should inspire slow and careful advances through the map and tactical cooperation with other players on your team, but honestly, right now, everyone seems content to just run at top speed all over the map and shoot each other in the face. The maps themselves aren't designed particularly well for Team Deathmatch, though. If one team pushes in far enough, they'll basically swarm the other end and just spawnkill everyone, and the match timers feel a bit too long.\n\nWhat also concerns me a bit is that it seems to be entirely matchmaking driven. I don’t want matchmaking, I want server browser. There’s an option to join games as part of a squad, which helps with getting friends into the game, but I still want more freedom and more options. I get that a lot of games run their own servers and want to control things to make the experience smoother, but I’d really like the trend of relieving players of control and choice to turn back. In this case I also assume the level-based systems make it so that high level characters will mince the newbies, but it still does work against making me want to stay.\n\nAll in all this is a broad, ambitious start. What this is not, however, is the part of Survarium which is actually interesting. Because the truth is that I have played many, many competent and pretty multiplayer FPS games in recent months/years. I’ve enjoyed them, of course, but I haven’t stuck around for most. Some of them have been Free-to-play, and others not. Survarium lies somewhere between Warface and the Tripwire games in both its delivery and its execution, which means that it’s relatively unusual, but also looking at competition from both crowds. As a straight up multiplayer FPS (which is all it is as of now), it’s not going to stand out from the many extraordinarily well-featured FPS games we now have available to us. The level-based stats improvement and unlock system are a pretty familiar thing nowadays, so screwing around in inventory world (and having to make sure you're well dressed and armed for your fight) comes as no surprise.\n\nThat said, perhaps the sheer desire for this kind of world and setting, as well as the seemingly limitless enthusiasm of East European markets for brutal hardcore FPS games, will see it through. I hope so, because it’s a game I want to see grow and mature.\n\nIn conclusion, it’s promising. And I say promising not because I expect this PvP part of the game to become a shining gem, but rather that it might be indicative of the quality of the as-yet-unseen Freeplay and Co-op game modes which Vostok have said will arrive at a later date. That quality could potentially be enormously high. I just hope that they’ve done this the right way around. Surely it was wise to create a proof of concept their tech and combat mechanics in a straightforward game mode like this, but I hope that it doesn’t find itself foundering in competitive waters before it gets to the stuff that genuinely makes the Survarium world an exciting prospect.\n\nI try not to compare this to Stalker too much, but if Vostok’s first game does emerge as an online successor to the Stalker games, then they will have achieved much. Stalker, of course, had a decent multiplayer component too, but it was never that part of the game which truly captured our imaginations.\n","April 10, 2015","true","32.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I mean the only things to rage about that are legit are real FPS problems. Like people cry about spawn camping, but that is a classic part of FPS, I mean I know the new ones hold your hand and there are kids complaining who can't afford a real game but come on if you haven't had to fight your way out of a bad sitution or lost a battle in an FPS badly then you really haven't played any good ones. I mean I have been camped 3 times 2 of those times I was able to help push them back, and we had a good match still lost but we didn't give up and shift tab still in a match to complain or write reveiws so we got out of the spawn area and still had a fighting chance to get some kills and exp.\n\nAnother complaint I read is its 8x8 with random maps, that is how most FPS were, and some still are. I know the new age shiny gamer doesn't like this, they only want to learn to play one map, but its .27 you kind of have to have people play every map to you know figure out how the maps need to be changed if they do. It goes right into the whole they only want to play to win, not to play mentality I guess. Some maps I do not like but each time I play I figure out more and more of it, and how I can play it better this is called FPS gaming.\n\nThe game is server side so sniping and aiming requires remembering there is a tiny delay as the server says you shot them not your computer so sniping takes a little more skill, and practice and requires you to lead a little on moving targets since depeding on server ping you may just bearly miss that headshot. Sadly this makes SMGs all the rage of low tier combat, but there a few good snipers out there, and I kind of prefer the sniper to be rare, and annoying as hell with skilled ones doing quite well for themselves. Anyways traditional hacks don't work at all as of right now only ESP hacks work the weakest of all hacks, and they claim to have a good system in place to track those who scan data to ESP hack, and even do a ban list as proof they are catching the few hackers.\n\nThe last one every one has taken a swing at, the P2P means P2W, I haven't seen this once in game and already reading threads about people not happy that they can't buy cooler stuff that the stuff is actualy too weak for them to want to buy it. To me that is a plus, the bonus of paid gun is increased coin earning with it, but people still want an OP gun that will carry them from tier 1 to tier 6 saddly. But rest assured this isn't in the game, I saw some one claim there was a shotgun that was OP, I killed 2 people with that shotgun using a lvl 2  SMG at close range, they quickly ditched the shotgun and swaped to SMGs to fight using their other profiles gun.","April 9, 2015","true","56.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamplerFi/recommended/355840/","SamplerFi","TooMuchStarbucks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamplerFi/","235 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nYes yes game's good yes yes played it before it was released on Steam yes yes it's nowhere near complete (though at least it's now listed as Early Access).\n\nI dun wanna talk about much of the game itself. I do want to however address concerns of it being P2W. Because it is, and it isn't. I think the term P2W is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and if I were to describe Survarium it'd be "P2GA" or "Pay to get an advantage". That's what most "P2W" games are really. Regardless I'll continue addressing it as P2W just so that people can understand.\n\nWith about 90 dollars of DLC content already out on the Steam store alone (with this game not even being out), it's near impossible for anyone to argue that the game isn't slightly "P2W". The Steam Content alone is quite mind boggling. The packs provide players with no experience weapons that normally require a ton of gametime just to be ALLOWED to use. Actually having the silver to buy them with is another story. The Steam packs not only save you in game currency, but the time needed to level up the specific faction that the gun belongs to.\n\nSo with all of that said, allow me to make a complete 180 by saying that everyone with negative reviews harping on the game's "P2W" nature's a bunch of babies with no actual skill. I'd go as far as to assume that they didn't even touch the game if it wasn't a requisite to making a review. Now, why're they obviously over exaggerating? One gun.\n\nThe PPSh-41 babey\nand to a slightly lesser extent the mosin.\n\nThe time to kill in this game is insane, for EVERY gun, and as such the advantage gained from having P2W weapons and gear is laughable at best. The damage done from a few rounds from a orange rarity (highest) high level AKM, and a default PPSh ( a FREE weapon with FREE ammo)  is almost indiscernable. The person who's gonna win the fight is the player with the proper game sense and aim, not the one who spent 90 bucks on "advantages" that barely mean anything.\n\nI'd just like to reiterate that the developers are obviously trying to get as much money they can get their hands on. These aren't all that great business practices, especially for an incomplete game. I'm just tired of seeing negative reviews full of people who just can't aim with the two best weapons in the ♥♥♥♥ing game, acting like the DLC actually matters. It doesn't. What's getting you killed isn't the stats, it's you sucking.\n\nAgain, the game's good. It's incomplete. It performs fine (staying around 70-80 FPS) for me but apparently it's not performing well for some (not like the game is still being developed or something...). It's P2GA babey, and I love it.","April 9, 2015","true","29.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

But as it stands the game is an incredibly fun, fast paced yet still tactical game that any fps gamer or certainly any post-apoc genre fan should give a go.\n\nThe maps are interesting, expansive, good fun to explore and master with countless bottlenecks, sniping positions and storming points for players of all preferences to master; the weather changes and this has a vast effect on the maps themselves, forcing players to adapt. They include anomalies and radiation zones, poison clouds and all other manner of environmental forces that, when coupled with beartraps of thoughtful positioning make for a real challenge.\n\nThe Character customisation is a dream for the more rolaplying, kit orientated players (like myself). the choice is finite, albeit within four factions, two of which are open at the beginning of the game. select your gun, your clothing and kit, and off you go. it's quick, but in depth enough that you get the feel of a proper loadout. there are masses of guns and armour throughout the reputation stages, unlocked and then bought by grinding rep and currency. The end tier stuff looks amazing to me, which makes me want to continue playing.\n\nThe actual FPS capabilities of the game are very good. its well balanced and matched well to the maps, meaning everyone can play their own style, be it support, sniper or assault. its twitchy, visceral and VERY lethal, very realisitic. reminiscent of red orchestra, if not identical. you can attempt to heal yourself through kit, but honestly one shot is enough to have you scrambling back to cover and praying you dont bleed out. the gun sound effects are crisp and if you are carfeul you can tell which way battle or enemies lie which is a plus.\n\ngraphically, I found it a touch grainy regardless of a settings change; that said it doesnt look awful at all. it just means that at extreme distances it becomes hard to aim at enemies because thy begin to blur and pixxelate.\n\nThe 8/10 reflects that I would like to see more armour choices and perhaps physical customisation impemented, like bein able to choose items like knives or "trophies" to attach at points to your character. It also reflects that It has begun to become a bit stale after only a few hours of play, the fact being that ive ecplored a lot of the content that the game offers even after such a short time playing.\n\n","April 8, 2015","true","7.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Most of the problems listed in the other reviews are not a problem for me.\n\nPros:\n- Great graphics and sound\n- Guns feel more like actual guns rather than peashooters\n- Decent progression\n- Solid gameplay\n- Unrestricted customization (No classes)\n- Maps are nicely made, both in scenery and layout\n\nCons:\n- Some maps feel a bit too small while some others feel a bit too large\n- Poorly optimized, runs a bit slow even on Minimal, should be easy for the devs to iron out in a couple updates\n- Frequent crashes, 2 of my 3 game sessions ended that way\n- Spawns are very open, possible to get shot dead as soon as you spawn\n- Very difficult to join anything other than Team Deathmatch (at least I haven't been able to join one yet)\n\nOverall it's a decent game, still in early access. Free Roam will come eventually which will definitely add a lot more new content. I haven't seen any Pay 2 Win yet, and I don't think there really is any at all in the game's current state.\n\nEdit: I can't even play this game right now because it crashes less than a few minutes in.

Gameplay is a mix of online PVP game types and is pretty standard. What really shines is the amazing graphics and very simple but polished movement and gunning. Maps usually have cramped tight spaces and wide open areas. The guns all have long range and high damage that makes engagements short and tense at close range, at long range the environment allows for a lot of use of cover and concealment and feels like a more tactical game.\n\nThe currency system seems expense for real money investments, but I've been getting free currency after every match at a pretty good rate. There some items that are paid currency only, but there are a bunch of free currency items that you can buy. The guns are all so high damage that I doubt that any paid guns or armor could be "better" than the free ones. So that's nice.\n\nTLDR:Awesome online PVP shooter, top notch graphics, charmingly russian location.\n","April 23, 2015","true","6.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","6","10","2","0"

The thing that sets this one apart from the others is that it's simply more tense in comparison to other shooters and by that I mean you actually have to be careful going around corners if you don't want to be "snuck up" on by a camper. Sound is a very important mechanic here and being crouched makes you silent. If you are always crouched you can, if in a building, always hear an enemy player approaching giving you enough time to find a cozy corner and "surprise" the enemy. Indeed crab walking is the best walking. Visual assets do look somewhat dated but they get the job done. They just arent anything close to eye candy. Gun play was satisfying and what is here would make a good, satisfying base for an open world, free to play, MMO.\n\nI would say you can pass on it at the moment, but surely keep an eye out for when the open world gameplay is finished and released.","April 28, 2015","true","11.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","7","12","2","0"

There are netcode issues and the game still isn't fully optimized (my FPS goes to hell on two maps in particular, but stays at a stable 60-70 on every other).\n\nUnlike other FTP games, the pay-for weaponry isn't any better than the ones you can earn, aside from perhaps one slightly useful stat which, if you're lucky, you can get when you upgrade the normal variant, and aren't stuck with two other semi-useless traits (let's face it, reliability isn't all that useful as of right now).\n\nI'm on the same train of thought as everyone else in one aspect: give me freemode! But unlike others, I can wait. I'd rather they release a more whole product than a completely unfinished version of it, as people nowadays are as likely to flock away from an unfinished product in beta as they are in full release.\n\nIn short, if you don't mind an arena-like shooter with somewhat realistic mechanics and some technical issues, I'd recommend this. If you are having problems dying to SMGs or the like (as of 2.7), I recommend coming back with the next update, where every faction and several guns are being rebalanced.\n\nEdit as of 2.8: Okay, so 2.8 hit and the game has been rebalanced. I see far more variety of weapons in the field, and that is fantastic; no more is the rifle-SMG combo dominating til super high tiers. Now I see shotguns, SMGs, rifles, assault rifles, etc - all of them and beyond. But, not all is sunshine and rainbows.\n\nNorth American servers are still MIA, and as a North American player, I'm one of those suffering from it. Not to mention hit detection and the like. Still, I can keep my vote positive if only due to my only like of the game - but everyone should take it with a slight grain of salt at this point in time.","April 26, 2015","true","171.6"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

So, here's a helpful review (hopefully) to Steam users and developers\n\nFirst of all, this game is not finished. It's still in early access and it still lacks a lot of content that a game of this ambition and potential needs.\n\nThe good:\n\nWhen it comes down to equipment, this game does certainly not lack. There is a full arsenal of well known and not so well known Russian weapons (predominantly). The guns are attractive, and the sound of the guns feel great, the shots echo through the map very nicely, much like in Ghost Recon:Phantoms. Weapons bought with real money do not give players advantage over players that have weapons bought by in-game currency (90% of the guns are bought by in game currency). Devs have announced that they will implement weapon modding, and from what i have seen, it will be very detailed, and it only benefits the game. Level design is highly comparable to that of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. The sheer size of maps could make them a great plot setting. Matches do take a life of their own, but it mostly comes down to snipers hiding away in a bush and people buzzing through choke points with rifles. This is something that some people won't like, but i kind of like the open-ness of Survarium; there are a lot of different routes a player can take to flank his enemies. It's not an action-packed sprayfest and i'm totally OK with that. I play this game completely relaxed, with no need to rush anywhere or be mad at anyone, which most online shooters will make you do.\n\nSome other thoughts/the bad:\n\nMenu design and interface could be done a lot better, tho. The system's simple enough, and presentation should be simple as well. How it is now, it's pretty confusing to most of new players out there. Design is VERY IMPORTANT, in every product! Weapon upgrade system is practically a big gamble on your in game currency, and i don't like it that way. The game's not too well-optimized, nor does it support voice comms yet.\n\nArtifact hunt just doesn't pay off. Artifacts can give you a temporary boost of attributes for the length of the match, but i find having 3 medkits much more useful than having a random artifact in your inventory instead. And if you want artifacts, you have to give up medkit slots, because artifact detector takes up the slots reserved for medkits. I find this kind of ironic because i got the idea that the developers actually wanted to make artifact hunt one of the primary interests for players in the game, which is not the case.\n\nThe trouble is, the thing i like the most about this game is potential. Can Vostok make the most of it? Time will tell.","April 21, 2015","true","109.7"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","10","18","0","0"

Developement takes time and patience. bug fixing and listening to our complaints and cheers. Understand these are well seasoned game makers and they know how to do their jobs. it is not easy making a game that suits every single player. thank you.\n\nTL;DR\n\nIn just a few hours of playing i have already gotten 1 item from the end of match random loot that would have required me to level up a different faction to purchase it. I really like it regardless of the iffy reviews :) not to mention I am not too fond of team vs team PVP in a confined area. Though the map sizes and numerous paths you can take do help. Hopefully they will soon be announcing the PVE/Co-op/Story mode they mentioned early on.\n\nReview\n\nLooking for a shooter with a cash shop that actually doesnt go fully to end game gear? Survarium has just that! the gear you can earn by leveling up a faction is far superior to the items found in the cash shop :) Sure there are some items that give wallet warriors an upper hand but in most cases unless its a clean headshot, you still have a chance to shoot back.\n\nGood\n\n•Selectable server region with ping and player display - choose how far you are willing to reach for your matchmaking - click below the Play button in-game to choose your best ping options\n•Dynamic matchmaking that tries to compensate for the number of players searching - you may end up with some lower or higher levels on your team/opposing team\n•Great atmosphere\n•Plenty of places to hide\n•A chance (or chances if you use premium currency) to get random loot drops at the end of each match - quite often spare parts for upgrading your gear and a chance to get some decent gear too!\n•Upgradeable gear with either currency - enhance your gear or take it apart for upgrading other gear!\n•Basic semi self healing with visual display of injuries - items can boost this and other elements\n•Kill or Scare you opponents by disabling their limbs and even hands\n•Build your character to handle situations you want - Hide in an anomoly and become immune to it then lure enemies that havent chosen that path into it and giggle while doing so\n•Cash shop that is fair and doesnt offer endgame gear - you can also earn free premium currency by doing things within the game\n•Items in the cash only shop require you to level up! - No right off the tutorial wallet warriors! They have to earn it first!\n•Not everything in the 'shop' is cash only - it is a combined in-game currency shop as well\n•High ping auto freeze/position correction - halts Disconnectors from getting an edge in fights\n\nBad\n\n•Dynamic matchmaking system can occasionally make the fight hard if you are low - mid level\n•Sometimes long que wait times while the matchmaking tries to find you a spot\n•Cash shop (no end game show stopping gear - you can earn better gear than the shop offers)\n•Sometimes glitchy visuals on anomolies\n•no PVE/Co-op other than the usual team play (as of this review)","February 7","true","48.4"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","10","18","0","0"

There will be no PVE mode for Survarium despite devs constant promises that they are working on it since 2014.\nHas some cool ideas, the gunplay and artifact stuff is at least interesting, however only the hardcore community remain who will happily mow you down with pay-to-win weapons (of which there are a lot) and insult you over it. Some of the environments are nice and might be worth a look or 2 if you're into the Stalker games, but apart from that it's just another Free to Play shooter.\n\nEdit: Check out this game, Escape from Tarkov.

If everyone had the same guns it would be boring but balanced. The issue is lower level players are being paired against such players due to lack of playerbase which results in equipment combinations that are game breaking.\n-There are no meaningful camo options in shop for example the ghillie suit from fringe settler is glitched and looks like a glowing white jellyfish from a distance.\n-Lack of NA servers making the game unplayable on higher tiers where first to shoot usually wins in light of high damage weapons.\n-Players who do play are grinding gear in anticipation of freeplay and co-op. If news comes that a freeplay or co-op account is a totally seperate profile with seperate ranks the vast majority of the already small fanbase will quit the game.\n\npros-\n-looks kind of like stalker\n-there are some people still playing the game\n-an update is coming\n-free play might be here at Christmas\n-on level 1 games you can own new players if you have even minutely better equipment and farm your way to higher levels if need be by purposefully wearing worthless equips. PPSH VS KIPARIS w/ ap rounds LOLOLOLOLOL.\n-Hiding in foilage works against legit players.\n-Sniping kills in one hit allowing you to cause other players to rage, you may even shoot legs to cripple people for humor.\n-melee kills in one hit by touching, not hitting enemies in kevlar or even BOMB SUIT with a buttstroke. (a naked level 1 noob can kill a lv 15 guy with a buttstroke yes)\n-game will not all a sudden get freeplay so if you rank up now you will be unstoppable in 1 or 2 years when the game releases freeplay.\n-team killing has no consequences as at level 1 with a ppsh everything is FREE. As in Free to play!\n-no NA servers so EU players can stomp new NA players like Kratos in god of war due to better connection.\n-bear traps and lots of them, you can infact stack up to 4-5 allowing you to kill any player who does not see them.\n-If you shoot people in the hands they flop like a fish in a barrel not being able to do anything.\n- revisiting snipers you can shoot people even team mates in the feet to cripple them.\n- spawn camping the other team allows for faster progression and is infact an endorsed position by devs who actually have a guide teaching you how to spawn camp <- go surviarium guides.\n-There are lots of afks at times in certain games allowing the smart player to sneak in enemy spawn and just melee camp <- highly reccomending for power leveling.\n-If you really have to you can buy a premium vsk-94 and go on rekting players YES LEVEL 1 WITH LV 14 GUN CAN BE PRO STATUS very reccomended. Infact the VSS vintorez pay version will soon have 20 round mag in new patch while regular only has 10. Sr-3m super kryptonite tipped super ubersmetch weapon will have 30 round magazine premium but only 20 regular.\n-once you reach lv 15 you become super soldier and can walk around with pkm like call of duty 2 juggernaut causing earthquake tsunami and tribulation to new and old players alike NO ONE CAN ESCAPE YOU WHO CAN MAKE WAR WITH YOU? lolololol.\n-maps are so big you can run across in about 18 seconds if you are ninja. good news is most new people do not know maps so you can be like Predator and stalk new people with impunity!\n\n\nin short VERY VERY recommended game bestest game ever.

The Customer service sucks. Everytime I try to open this game it has a grayed out Updating button and it does nothing.

This issue has been happening to other people since before June and you would think they would know what the problem was. There's nothing wrong with my Ram nor time on my pc (Which I still don't even see why this is an issue being that it is CORRECT!). Do I recommend this game to others? I decline. If they get better customer support that actually knows what they're doing then maybe i'll change my review but for this being the worst experience i've ever had with a game so far, this is the review I have of this game.

Survarium has a feeling of the good-ol' FPS games (CoD, CoD2 and more) mixing fast-pace and tactical feeling, coplex mechanics (bleeding, breath and so on), RPG elements and 3-dimensional map design. Survarium is as much about surviving as finishing your objectives.\n\nAlthough PVP is very fun, with interesting modes and TDM (Team Deathmatch), I can't wait to play the open-world mode, which is said to increase the level of complexity with the character building and gameplay.\n\nWith the more tactical feeling than other FPS games around, I would like to see some features added, such as leaning (peeking over to the left or right), prone (should add yet another way of surviving), weapon attachments (to increase further the way to modify and upgrade a weapon), team-mate healing (essentially giving the option to become a medic) and more weapons, armor and factions (weapons from all around the world and such).\n\nMap and match-making needs slight improvements aswell. Often times, teams are not equal skill-based, leading to 'ownage' of the weaker team. It seems like adding layers of comparison between players (K/D ratio, W/L ratio and such) would improve match-making.\nMap design is great for the most part. Spawn locations and the easy way for the opponents to access them is problematic. Even though there are systems which defend new spawned players (you can't damage someone who just spawned or something like that), 'spawn ♥♥♥♥♥♥' is definitely a thing you see from time to time, especially with poor-made and unequal skilled matches.\n\nSurvarium is definitely a recommend, with great gameplay now and many things to look for.\n\n","April 23, 2015","true","41.5"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","15","28","3","0"

The first thing I would like to say is that the community is great around this game. The few interactions I have had with the in game player have been very enjoyable and the player seem very enthusiastic about Survarium. While being free to play Survarium is far from pay to win. This being said you can buy nearly everything in the game at the beginning with real life currency, but CANNOT buy weapons or anything that allows you to have a great advantage other players. The only thing you can buy in this game is fast track to unlocks and customizations.\nRight now Survarium is just a team based fps, but the devs have said they are planning to add more content as well as a freeplay (PvE) mode. Right now Survarium is just a typical fps game with different gamemodes but the freeplay mode is really what I think will make Survarium stand out in the crowd. While the freeplay mode is what seems the most interesting thing to me, the PvP portion is done well and most of the weapons feel really good/impactful. There is plenty of customizations (clothing, weapons, items, and different camos). The best part of the PvP to me is the interesting large maps and the well done gunplay. While I can’t say Survarium is the best game, but if you enjoy competitive FPS games you should check this out. I personally looking forward to the PvE mode and can’t wait for it to be released.\nPros\nTons customization\nCool PvP map layouts\nSolid and impactful gunplay\nInteresting lore and backstory\nNot pay to win\nGreat Graphics\nSkill trees\nHuge potential\nCons\nUnbalanced weapons\nPvE mode seems to be taking forever to come out\nNo prone\nPerformance issues (I had problems with windowed mode, but many other players report more problems)\nBad connection issues\n\nConclusion\nSurvarium is an online, free to play, FPS game that is only PvP right now. The gunplay is solid and the maps are designed well, but I am looking forward to the PvE portion of the game. It is not pay to win as some people claim, but it does take time to unlock things “naturally” in Survarium. If you are a competitive FPS fan defiantly check this out. As well, keep an eye on Survarium for the PvE portion of the game to release.\nVideo Review\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uODOrzUiFLM&feature=youtu.be\n\n-HiPFiRED\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

And guess what they were right. :p Sooooo heres the real review for this game: I love this game feels like the the old days of COD 1+2, It has major potential it's fun to play. Some things they really need to work on, Shot recognition is iffy, If you aim at something it may or may not register. Other than that everything else coming along nicely.\n\nUpdate: Hackers are unchecked,  Also it's totally unbalanced Free to pay should be more like it as with any free game you'll need to buy weapons that actually work. Mine most of the time hardly even make a scratch. And it's not just buy our game it's buy our game over and over and over again. Daily , monthly or yearly. So I still recommend the game up to the levels where you'll start losing money instead of making it and thats if you can put up with the dead on site from a arm wound while you just pumped 30 bullets into the guy and he gets the kill.

It reminds me of the old Call of duty games, where a rifle can really be effectively used.\n\nThe only downsides to this game are:\nThe lag - i often run at around 30-40ping but out of nowhere it flies up to 400-600ping and i jump all over the place. When this happens my view shoots up into the sky and im looking down on the map for a split second and then it flies back to normal. But having my scope up and kneeling up is cleared and i just stand back up and put my gun down.

If you like STALKER you will love this game!\nFirst thing first: It's not P2W. What matters in this game are skills, tactics and teamwork. You can have an AK but I can kill you with a pistol from 200 meters if you aren't careful enough. The gameplay is smooth (easy and fast). The atmosphere is amazing. The maps are well made, good structured. The guns feel good, almost real. You will wait for a battle from 10 sec.-1min. not long if you ask me (at least now). A battle is going to last from 10 to 15 minutes. You should add leaning mechanic (it improves the gameplay a lot).

And guess what they were right. :p Sooooo heres the real review for this game: I love this game feels like the the old days of COD 1+2, It has major potential it's fun to play. Some things they really need to work on, Shot recognition is iffy, If you aim at something it may or may not register. Other than that everything else coming along nicely.\n\nUpdate: Hackers are unchecked,  Also it's totally unbalanced Free to pay should be more like it as with any free game you'll need to buy weapons that actually work. Mine most of the time hardly even make a scratch. And it's not just buy our game it's buy our game over and over and over again. Daily , monthly or yearly. So I still recommend the game up to the levels where you'll start losing money instead of making it and thats if you can put up with the dead on site from a arm wound while you just pumped 30 bullets into the guy and he gets the kill.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pleasantagony/recommended/355840/","pleasantagony","pleasantagony","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pleasantagony/","130 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUPDATE - 6/26/15\nOkay, so it has been a few months since my original review, and my opinion about this game has changed substantially. While I can't quite bring myself to NOT recommending it, I struggle to have fun with it at this point in time.\n\nI think that all of my problems can be boiled down to one major issue: There are very few American players! They've recently introduced the option of selecting which server regions you want to look for, which is a major plus. However, I have a hard time finding a game on a North American server.  The later I play in the day, the lower the number of players. This makes sense because I know the developer is Ukrainian, so they are bound to have more of a following closer to home.\n\nThanks to the lack of closer players, matchmaking is a real issue. I often times get thrown into a match that is filled with higher ranking people. One time, I cut my profile back to 2 so that I could play with a newcomer friend of mine. We got completely destroyed, and when I looked at the stats of the highest ranking player on the other team, he had a LEVEL 9 profile!! Why would anyone want to play a match that is so ridiculously unbalanced?!\n\nWell, like I mentioned, I think the lack of players on my continent is the real cause of my problems at the moment. I would still recommend the game becuase it can be fun, and it is refreshingly different than many of the online FPS on the market. We just need more American players!!\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW\nThe maps are my favorite part about this game. They are vibrant and well balanced for a fair fight. Some are more geared towards close-quarter engagements and others are great for the snipers. There are a good number of them, too, so it doesn't feel like you are getting thrown into the same maps over and over,\n\nThe spawning scheme can be a blessing and a curse. There are zones at either end of the maps where each team spawns. This makes those areas a hot bed of activity as there is always somebody trying to sneak in for an easy kill. I couldn't tell for sure, but I think there is a short period of time after someone spawns during which they are bullet proof. I spawned in front of an enemy once, and I was able to kill him even though he had pumped a fair amount of metal into me.\n\nThere are a fair amount of weapons to unlock and purchase. Some weapons can only be purchased with gold. There is currently a bit of a balance issue with some guns. Particularly, it's not uncommon to take a level 5 AKS-74U against a level 2 Kiparis and lose every time. The AKS-74U has superior damage and penetration, but is no match for the fire rate of the Kiparis\n\nI'm not a fan of the upgrade system. It is very original, but it's also very hard and costly to upgrade weapons with even a few modifications. In order to upgrade a weapon, you have to have a duplicate of that weapon. You then spend in-game money to ATTEMPT to upgrade. There is no gaurantee that you will get it. And, once you have a modification, there is a chance you can lose it with a failed attempt to upgrade again. The more mods you get, the harder it is to succeed at getting more. Furthermore, you have no control over what mod you get. There is a way to attempt to change your mods, but, again, you have to have a spare gun to try it.\n\nThere is no incentive to use one gun or another. Maybe I'm used to games like BF and CoD (booo, I know), but I like to earn things for my weapons by using them successfully. As you use a weapon over and over, you get proficient at it. This should be reflected somehow with upgrades, or maybe an increased chance at upgrade success.\n\nOverall, I'm really liking this game, and have lured a handful of friends into liking it as well. There are a few aspects that really irritate me, but for being early access and free, this is off to a great start!","April 20, 2015","true","51.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pleasantagony/recommended/355840/","pleasantagony","pleasantagony","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pleasantagony/","130 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUPDATE - 6/26/15\nOkay, so it has been a few months since my original review, and my opinion about this game has changed substantially. While I can't quite bring myself to NOT recommending it, I struggle to have fun with it at this point in time.\n\nI think that all of my problems can be boiled down to one major issue: There are very few American players! They've recently introduced the option of selecting which server regions you want to look for, which is a major plus. However, I have a hard time finding a game on a North American server.  The later I play in the day, the lower the number of players. This makes sense because I know the developer is Ukrainian, so they are bound to have more of a following closer to home.\n\nThanks to the lack of closer players, matchmaking is a real issue. I often times get thrown into a match that is filled with higher ranking people. One time, I cut my profile back to 2 so that I could play with a newcomer friend of mine. We got completely destroyed, and when I looked at the stats of the highest ranking player on the other team, he had a LEVEL 9 profile!! Why would anyone want to play a match that is so ridiculously unbalanced?!\n\nWell, like I mentioned, I think the lack of players on my continent is the real cause of my problems at the moment. I would still recommend the game becuase it can be fun, and it is refreshingly different than many of the online FPS on the market. We just need more American players!!\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW\nThe maps are my favorite part about this game. They are vibrant and well balanced for a fair fight. Some are more geared towards close-quarter engagements and others are great for the snipers. There are a good number of them, too, so it doesn't feel like you are getting thrown into the same maps over and over,\n\nThe spawning scheme can be a blessing and a curse. There are zones at either end of the maps where each team spawns. This makes those areas a hot bed of activity as there is always somebody trying to sneak in for an easy kill. I couldn't tell for sure, but I think there is a short period of time after someone spawns during which they are bullet proof. I spawned in front of an enemy once, and I was able to kill him even though he had pumped a fair amount of metal into me.\n\nThere are a fair amount of weapons to unlock and purchase. Some weapons can only be purchased with gold. There is currently a bit of a balance issue with some guns. Particularly, it's not uncommon to take a level 5 AKS-74U against a level 2 Kiparis and lose every time. The AKS-74U has superior damage and penetration, but is no match for the fire rate of the Kiparis\n\nI'm not a fan of the upgrade system. It is very original, but it's also very hard and costly to upgrade weapons with even a few modifications. In order to upgrade a weapon, you have to have a duplicate of that weapon. You then spend in-game money to ATTEMPT to upgrade. There is no gaurantee that you will get it. And, once you have a modification, there is a chance you can lose it with a failed attempt to upgrade again. The more mods you get, the harder it is to succeed at getting more. Furthermore, you have no control over what mod you get. There is a way to attempt to change your mods, but, again, you have to have a spare gun to try it.\n\nThere is no incentive to use one gun or another. Maybe I'm used to games like BF and CoD (booo, I know), but I like to earn things for my weapons by using them successfully. As you use a weapon over and over, you get proficient at it. This should be reflected somehow with upgrades, or maybe an increased chance at upgrade success.\n\nOverall, I'm really liking this game, and have lured a handful of friends into liking it as well. There are a few aspects that really irritate me, but for being early access and free, this is off to a great start!","April 20, 2015","true","51.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The layout of diffirent tiers is quite similar to World Of Tanks or Warthunder ect. The BIGGEST PROBLEM Survarium or some might call it "LAGarium" is definatley the ping and frame rate issues (poor optimizations). Other than that if both of those problems  were fixed, the game could be really enjoyable.

If your new and don't want to be crushed play on peak times.\n+ There are quite a few good weapons with decent iron sights, but i still hate it ;p. (HK416 has a red dot, but its glowing so hard you can't see much in dark areas)\n+ Zubr armor is still hard to defeat, look at the balance part. It is doable with rank 8 weapons.\n+ I see less spawn camping now, mainly due to better players in the ranks i play in. Still happonds if one of the teams hold back too much.\n\n+/- Need premium to level up in a decent way (+50 exp +50 silver +50 faction rep). But since its FreeToPlay... hey the devs need something to eat right?\n+/- Community can seem to be rotten, but its simple. You get what you put in it. Whine and act like a ♥♥♥♥♥ and it will come back.\n\n- SVD, i ♥♥♥♥ing hate that thing. Low levels ripping open Molot/Zubr guys like its nothing. Grow balls you lame asses.\n\nThats it for now :).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLooks fun, plays quite ok but...\n\n- Terribad balance in ranked games.\n- Only extremely high tier weapons come with scopes, so if your bad with ironsights... well good luck...\n- AK12 + Tier 15 armor = win (now Tier 10, tiers got changed later from 15 to 10)\n- Lots and lots of spawn camping\n- Need premium to level up in a decent way (+50 exp +50 silver +50 faction rep)\n- Got stupid team mates that run over your traps?

It's RPG Elements were fresh, to me, and it has done well in areas most other free-to-play FPS games have failed, most notably:\n\n\n- Ranking systems based on level and equipment which make sense, are intuitive and set you up against players of comparable skill level. Although occasionally a player far to good to be in your tier does slip in.\n- The visuals are unexpectedly good, the aesthetic of old and new russian weaponry is very pleasing, the post apocolyptic feel is captured well for the most part.\n- The controls feel responsive and intuitive, in moments where they don't such things are intentional game mechanical decisions which make sense and contribute to the overall depth and possibly quality of the game (ie. such as where one adds stat points to improve the inefficiency of that kind of movement. Aiming down sight, running, etc.)\n- The game generally captures a realistic and punishing FPS feel without being innaccesible to 99% of the planet like DayZ or comparables.\n- Manages to only be minimalistically pay-to-win as of 4/6/2016.\n\nSome random neutral things to note about the game:\n\n- Finding a match can be a bit of a wait (2 minute one average for me, a low level player), but completely tolerable and understandable.\n- Matches are 8v8, not on the scale you might expect of other FPS games. This often serves to make matches more personal and most of your deaths will be due to skill imbalance and error.\n- I've never handled a gun in real life, can't speak to how realistic the firing of guns are in this game but I do know that many of the guns have a helluva lot of recoil so be prepared.\n\nMy largest gripes:\n\n- Possibly not highly optimized (coming from the perspective of only my system in 4/6/2016)\n- Lack of gender and race diversity.\n- (Correct me if I'm wrong, I will be playing more) The skill system seems to force you down one of two main focuses, either building efficiency of gunplay, or focusing on skills to help deal with a game element known as anomolies, glowing balls of energy that hurt you but can be harvested for superhuman powers.\n\nI'll comment more on the race and gender diversity here because I believe things need to be said of it. First off its one that I have with a lot of games. I found Survivarum's lack of race or gender diversity in character creation to be insulting personally, and unnecesary given that video games are essentially a limitless creative medium. More than just cisgender white men are interested in playing your game devs, and we'd like to be able to represent ourselves in your game space. A purely cisgender, white, male cast is not actually a necessary part of the aesthetic you are trying to capture. Nowadays there is enough awareness that there is no excuse for a lack of representation and presentation in video games and yeah I'm entitled to be able to play as someone other than Grizzly McWhiteDude, thanks.","April 6","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm in a love-hate relationship with this game... But i recommend this game as it has a lot of potential.\n\n+NOT P2W\nbut srly  this game is not p2w and everyone who says it is either trolling, or is terrible, i went completly f2p and i have 200000 in game currency which is enough to buy the godly guns & armor like the pkp pechneg or the a-545. Don't forget in the upcoming .28 update, the rank in whick u get items will be lowered  and the godly weapons will only require lvl 10 reputation , which is good for me as I am level 10 rep.\n\n+Good Sound design\nthe game has really good sound design, you can track people by their footsteps & gunshots though the gunshots are extremly loud which is realistic i guess, I'm not really a gun nut so i can't really confirm\n\n+ Good Graphics & Art Style\nthe graphics are really good and for a alpha/beta is surprisingly well optimized with my rig at max settings at 45-60fps\nthe art style is also awesome with the world being a post apocalyptic game but still being colorful and pretty and not dull and boring looking while still managing to look broken down & post apoclyptic. The art style makes up for any of the graphical shortcomings\n\n- Spawn campers\ntrust me if you're going up angainst a good team with a team of random noobs u r going to get spawnrekt by sniper rifles and since their aren't any kill cams... yeaaaa but the snipers aren't op as they have  lots of scope sway unless you crouch but it still is annoying. of course when the teams are balanced it isn't much of an issue which brings me to the next problem\n\n- matchmaking\nonce you become >19 it takes 5mins to matchmake and often because they can't find a game for you, you get matched up with a bunch of newbs, it can also happen the other way aroun\n\n- bugs\nthis is a beta but it gets so annoying when basic things like logging on doesn't work and the updater sometimes borks, indeed I currently have a annoying issue where when i try to logon with the steam verson it says connection error even though my internet it fine. while wierd glitches are ok in beta (it is a beta) issues with logging on is never acceptable unless the server is hacked or overloaded.\nEDIT: the connection error listed above actually got fixed 2ish days after it happened but i actually waited 2 days so it might have been fixed earlier.","April 12, 2015","true","41.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But that's the reason it's in early access, because it needs input from the community as it grows. But as of right now, this game is freaking awesome. While there is a lot of room for imporvement this is probably one of the best free to play games I have played on steam, and I've played a lot of them... The balance between start factions is pretty decent, the mechanics are solid especially compared to other games, and so far the game isn't really heavy on pay to win. While you can buy better guns with irl cash the game puts you in higher level lobbies with players closer to your equpment level and skill level. My biggest personal problem with this game currently is the spawn camping. I haven't seen a single game where there hasn't been one person inside of your spawn killing you as soon as the "spawn protection" is down. Although there are things already present in the game that could fix this if the developers had enough input on the subject. For example make each spawn radioactive to the opposite team at a decent range from the spawn and make that radioactivity ignore protective gear as the enemies get closer to the center of spawn. That would outright solve the problem. In spite of its problems though I would highly recomend this game, give it a try, hell it doesn't even take that long to download.","April 13, 2015","true","17.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

While there is a lot of room for imporvement this is probably one of the best free to play games I have played on steam, and I've played a lot of them... The balance between start factions is pretty decent, the mechanics are solid especially compared to other games, and so far the game isn't really heavy on pay to win. While you can buy better guns with irl cash the game puts you in higher level lobbies with players closer to your equpment level and skill level. My biggest personal problem with this game currently is the spawn camping. I haven't seen a single game where there hasn't been one person inside of your spawn killing you as soon as the "spawn protection" is down. Although there are things already present in the game that could fix this if the developers had enough input on the subject. For example make each spawn radioactive to the opposite team at a decent range from the spawn and make that radioactivity ignore protective gear as the enemies get closer to the center of spawn. That would outright solve the problem. In spite of its problems though I would highly recomend this game, give it a try, hell it doesn't even take that long to download.","April 13, 2015","true","17.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

This game has great map design and weapons are very lethal. You are given missions from your faction every day which keep things interesting. My biggest complaint so far is that everything is pretty expensive and there are only a couple guns available at lower levels.\nLuckily the matchmaking only puts you in games with people close to your own level, and I never felt like things were unbalanced.\nOverall I had a good time and am definitely going to check back soon when anomalies are implemented.

The bonuses for being near a friendly player who makes a kill and benefiting from his kill when you have done some damage to the same target are good.\n\nWeather and environmental effects such as sunlight, radioactive areas and areas with poisonous gases make for some unusual barriers as well as an interesting influence on play style. You learn quickly for example, that it is better to shoot out of the sun than into it, higher up is better but not always best and you cannot run through contaminated areas without the proper equipment and survive.\n\nThe fact that you can spawn just about anywhere at the later stages of a round keep the spawn campers to a minimum but there is still a lot of spawn killing.\n\nSince it is a beta version I assume that the complete lack of penalties for team killing will be added once they decide what is appropriate. The crazies take advantage of this fact sometimes and can really ruin a match if not dealt with.\n\nThat was my 2 cents worth ;)","April 17, 2015","true","49.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Currently a F2P game with options of buying things for extra help (as every F2P game does, gotta pay bills after all), this game does it well.

The guns sound a shoot well, and every little detail from the running and jumping feel very realistic.

People can cry all they want about the pay model but there is not a problem with it. The weapons you can buy are only good if you get them right away at level 1 and only stay that will untill equpiment level 6 then it becomes crap. You can mod your weapons to be way better than anything in that cash shop and the cash shop guns are basicially a lazy method to avoid doing any of that but it ends up being a problem down the line. Aside from the cash shop things the game is solid, it's extremely skilled based and somewhat of a twitch shooter but at the same time it reminds slow and a bit tatical.

The game feels like some sort of mix between Red Orchestra and Insurgency, and the general atmosphere is amazing and the kind I do not often see.\n\nPros:\n-Very high quality sounds. You can hear footsteps from the floor above you as enemies and friendlies rush around, The sound of the weapons firing is also amazing and truly has you immersed in the combat.\n-Glorious environment. The overgrowth in the maps truly sets the post-apocalyptic tone very well, and not only does it make the maps appear absolutely amazing, but the foliage actually provides good hiding spots.\n-Free to Play guns are good enough to give you a fighting chance.\n-Customisation is present even without spending money, albeit with ranked restrictions. You wanna look suave? Gotta work for it.\n-Realistic damage model, to an extent. If you get hit at all, chances are you're dead, bleeding out (then dying), or half dead. If you hit a guy in the face, they're dead, if you hit them in the leg, they'll slow dramatically. Powerful weapons like the mosin 'starter weapon' can kill anyone with one shot, their drawback being their bolt action mechanism.\n-It's just a generally beautiful game.\n\nCons:\n-P2W is present. Despite my earlier point, players can very easily buy the premium currency and buy considerably better weapons with it, making it much more difficult for people playing with standard in game currency.\n-Low recoil (could be considered a benefit, to be honest) makes long range SMG shooting relatively easy.\n-FPS dips in some points. Granted, I do not have a very good processor so that may be down to my own lack of power.\n-Team killing is awful. For whatever reason, people decide they're master trolls and shoot anyone in their own team, making your own score much worse than it could be, and if you retaliate you also lose points. There's no way to stop team killers.\n\nI definitely recommend this game.","April 16, 2015","true","80.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I have had the best time playing with my friends and just messing around while we try to win the game. The graphics are really good, the guns feel more balanced thanks to the new update (32.a). I love the way the armor looks, in all factions. I personally play as the Renisance Army because I like to be a tank, my friend plays as the Scavengers, and we both have found a lot of joy playing in those factions. The new update seems to have fixed almost all of my grevences with the game, the only thing I can say now is I get insane FPS drops on some servers, I have a really good computer and max this game out with ease and my internet is really stable. I don't know for sure what is causing this, but it doesn't happen TOO often. I have not yet gotten to play around with the league matches, as I am not a high enough rank (I've had to put a lot of time in lower level matches to help out a friend so I got less reputation for those games). If you are on the fence about getting this game, don't be! IT'S FREE! And the best free to paly I have played.\n\nPros-\n-Quite decent amount of guns\n-Decent amount of armor\n-The factions are diverce enough for varrying playstyles\n-Graphics are really beautiful\n-Sound design is really good\n-Ballance issues fixed for the most part\n-The anomally mechanic is really cool\n-The modifier mechanic will let you personalize your gun\n-Decent amount of maps\n-The maps are of really high quallity\n-You can unlock almost everything without pay-for currency (and what you can is the EXACT samething with a different skin and the modifiers pre-installed)\n-Daily quest are fun\n-The RPG elements add a lot to the game and let you further personalize your playstyle\n\nCons-\n-Sever conection issues (might just be me?)\n-Matchmaking times (it sometimes takes 7 mins, and sometimes 1)\n-Sometimes you get a rank 6-7 in a pridomantly rank 5 match, with a few rnak 4's thrown in non-peak hours which can make it really frusterating to be those lower ranks (and a lot of fun for the rank 6 and 7's) <-- can be fixed with more players.\n-There is a glitch were if one of your squadmates is wearing a certain mask, the glass of the mask thinks it is joined to your face, this only happens in the lobby with your squad, or post match with your team. This is less of a con, and more of a glitch that is funny as hell.\n\nI can proudly say that I recommend this game, I have gotten my friend and my brother to play it a lot, and as soon as my other friends get computer that aren't as old as sliced bread, they will join in on the fun.","October 23, 2015","true","231.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's fun to play with a friend and playing alone is also pretty fun. The game feels cool and adrenaline really starts pumping when you are in a 1V1 sniper battle or corner battle. Also the graphics are great! Although it looks fun there are some glitches and bugs that ruin the game completely. For instance getting stuck in a corner or under a prop. This can get annoying fairly quickly. Also... Shotguns are too OP. They damage you immensly on long ranges. They pretty much are the snipers of the game and I really think the devs should change this as quickly as possible as it annoys the crap out of me and many others.\nBut because it is a free game, give it a chance. I also hope the game will soon get out of BETA with better mechanics and some general improvements. I don't really know if I should give this game a tumbs down or up but with the current problems I can better give this game a tumbs down and reconsider it after the BETA has stopped and the final game releases.\nI still recommend you download this game and try it as it is free... but don't expect much :D\n(And yes, this may sound hypocrite...

The gun play, weapons handling and graphics are superb for a F2P game. The weapons feel older, more realistic than in some other shooters and it really compliments the atmosphere and setting of the game. You feel like you're using salvaged guns from the post apocalyptic wastes.\n\nHowever, unlike a lot of the serious competitive multi-player shooters available today Survarium does have problems in the sound department. While the guns are lound, crisp and realistic...the game has virtually no way of telling what direction a shot came from beynd the two standard soundings of close and far away.\nEnemy footsteps are also seemingly missing too. For any serious player these are essentials of any good shooter. Survarium will leave these players wanting.\n\nThe model does have the potential to be P2W, but as it stands right now it didn't feel that the enemies had any advantage on me for not paying and many of the free guns I used felt powerful enough to not need to dump real world money on "gold" guns.\n\nTeam kill can be an issue, however I only suffered this in one game out of arounf fifteen.\n\nGraphics 7/10\nSound 5/10\nGameplay 7/10\nStory N/A\nOriginality 5/10\nValue/replayability 8/10\n\nOverall Score 7/10\n","April 16, 2015","true","6.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

So on that note, I really really really enjoy this game. The servers as far as lag and hit detection are spot on. The gunplay is really well developed. The game is absolutely beautiful if you have a system that can run it at a decent fps on high. The level system is great too. It seems like they are leaning towards the P2W side of things as far as guns and what not, BUT there are guns, items, clothing, ect that can be unlocked with ingame money that is very easy to earn.

However if you're willing to stick with it and give feedback to the Devs then this might be for you.\n\nYes there are some bugs and there has been problems with the NA servers (not sure if they're sorted now, as we now have the 0.28 update as of today).\n\nThe positive\n+Really fun shooter\n+Cool customization\n+Nice character leveling system\n+Has enough scope to cater for most playstyles\n+Guns feel realistic (as of update 0.28)\n+Gun upgrading is a nice idea\n+Level designs are good\n+Active Devs\n+Random Anomalies (changes the way you move around the map, depending on gear)\n+Matchmaking is based on equipment level rather than character level\n\nThe Negative\n-Spawn Campers\n-Trolls (unfortunatly you can't stop them, however Devs will ban if you report them and they are deemed worthy of banning)\n-Matchmaking (has been a problem, putting lvl 5 equipment up against lvl 15, however the new update should change this)\n\nOne of the big deals with this game is that people think it's Pay to Win, I have to dissagree. There are premium weapons and they can give a slight advantage (maybe 10%) the majority of stuff that you can buy with real money is aesphetics such as a flag to put on you're top or bottoms.\nWith reguards to a premium weapon, yes it is fully upgraded with 3 modifications, however you cannot change these mods, so generally they only have 2 that improve the weapon and the 3rd that allows more income. When you upgrade weapons from scratch it's possible to have 3 upgrades that benifit the weapon.\n\nI should explain that mods are random you use one weapon to upgrade another of the same type (e.g. you upgrade a Mosin with a Mosin). There is a risk when upgrading, if you use in game currency, there is a chance of failing and if you're upgrading a weapon that's aready upgraded there is a chance of losing a modification.\n\nHopefully this review has sparked some interest and I'll see you on the battlefield.","April 27, 2015","true","259.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sharayde/recommended/355840/","Sharayde","Psycho Mantis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sharayde/","41 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI recommend this game. While the bugs and glitches break the game so far you can't call it a game anymore, for the most part the game is enjoyable, the combat is gritty, getting shot at incurs that feeling of "oh ♥♥♥♥ im gonna die! I need to throw this and run!" and when you get the R700 the sniping...well, really it's the sound effects that make you feel like you just had a grenade go off by your head, and the hitmarkers, seeing that 3rd tier of injury makes you feel amazing. When you get hit, and you are injured to the point that you cannot move, you get the feeling of "Im gonna die" again. The bleeding is a bit annoying, being shot, and being on 50% health to then bleed out is the most frustrating thing, but obviously early access blah blah blah. The P2W is really non-existant, i never have issues with people having a LMG, because you can't buy it, you still have to unlock the ability to buy your way to the end. All you can buy at the start is an AK, and a few other kinda good guns, nothing OP, meaning the game stays balanced. Towards the higher levels when you can buy a LMG, people already have guns that can deal with you, and you can't ever get too advantageous, which is great. I love the factions, which make you have to decide "what kind of weapons do i want? Should i go for a path that has nothing with good range, or take the path that only has short range assault weapons, and snipers?" This game has the ability to be great, now it's up to the developers to release the open-world part, and this will explode.","April 17, 2015","true","23.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

However if you're willing to stick with it and give feedback to the Devs then this might be for you.\n\nYes there are some bugs and there has been problems with the NA servers (not sure if they're sorted now, as we now have the 0.28 update as of today).\n\nThe positive\n+Really fun shooter\n+Cool customization\n+Nice character leveling system\n+Has enough scope to cater for most playstyles\n+Guns feel realistic (as of update 0.28)\n+Gun upgrading is a nice idea\n+Level designs are good\n+Active Devs\n+Random Anomalies (changes the way you move around the map, depending on gear)\n+Matchmaking is based on equipment level rather than character level\n\nThe Negative\n-Spawn Campers\n-Trolls (unfortunatly you can't stop them, however Devs will ban if you report them and they are deemed worthy of banning)\n-Matchmaking (has been a problem, putting lvl 5 equipment up against lvl 15, however the new update should change this)\n\nOne of the big deals with this game is that people think it's Pay to Win, I have to dissagree. There are premium weapons and they can give a slight advantage (maybe 10%) the majority of stuff that you can buy with real money is aesphetics such as a flag to put on you're top or bottoms.\nWith reguards to a premium weapon, yes it is fully upgraded with 3 modifications, however you cannot change these mods, so generally they only have 2 that improve the weapon and the 3rd that allows more income. When you upgrade weapons from scratch it's possible to have 3 upgrades that benifit the weapon.\n\nI should explain that mods are random you use one weapon to upgrade another of the same type (e.g. you upgrade a Mosin with a Mosin). There is a risk when upgrading, if you use in game currency, there is a chance of failing and if you're upgrading a weapon that's aready upgraded there is a chance of losing a modification.\n\nHopefully this review has sparked some interest and I'll see you on the battlefield.","April 27, 2015","true","259.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ectso/recommended/355840/","ectso","Ectso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ectso/","166 products in account","There is one man left on the planet. A russian scientist, who, before the world ending cataclysm, set up a cloning project that would soon doom the world. When the ashes cleared it was discovered that the cloning facility had been pumping copies of the scientist into the world. His clones rose up and repopulated, but only in the absoulte worst possible places. They grew strong. Too strong. They began to splinter. They created factions that innevitably went to war over the giant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that had arisen in the landscape during the cataclysm. Eventually the scientist began to grow mad, seeing himself anywhere he went. He lost all sanity. One fateful night he retreated to the top of some incredibly generic rusty russian industrial platform and put a gun in his mouth. He knew that this was no way to live. He had to kill himself. As his fingers' finely tuned muscles began to compress the trigger, a light bulb illuminated the depths of his mind. "NO! his brain cried out". He had to kill... HIMSELF. He pulled the gun out of his mouth and grinned. He would be the first person in the history of the human race to commit the act of homi-suicide and set out to murder... himself, with the help of a few of his clones. You are this scientist, Russian Woody Harrelson, and it's your goal to eliminate yourself. Over and over. And over. And over. And over. And over. And over again.\n\nAnyway, for a real review of this game... I've made it out of noob hell. If you can suffer through levels 1-10, you'll like what comes after. If you can't make it that far, you can expect:\n\nThe least inspired shooter to come along in awhile. there are 0 new mechanics added in to the game and nothing makes it stand out, gameplay wise.\n\nA hundred thousand of the same player model.\n\n2 guns, though slightly satisfying, are all you'll get for too damn long.\n\nUnbalanced levels. If you spawn on the wrong side and your team has a single weak link, expect to get shot almost as soon as you spawn.\n\nEvery other match you'll find at least one guy running around shooting teammates with that blank, homicidal look in his face, Eyes, unblinking as he just blows holes in the back of his colleagues heads, his face, expressionless.\n\nEvery time you lay a trap down you can expect to get more team kills than enemy kills even though all friendlies can see a giant god damned trap icon directly over the thing. Or you'll get those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that walk up to it and just ♥♥♥♥ing disarm it because ♥♥♥♥ you.\n\nEvery 3 matches you'll run across a person 10 levels higher than every one in the group and a few premium nubs. All you get is a single grenade or trap and your mothers hand knitted sweater made of fluff and love. Have fun fighting walking tanks, son. Everyone says premium isn't pay to win but every time I see a premo walk into a match they always seem to come out mvp.Sure, they're killable, but the scoreboards don't lie. They should have allowed premiums to only use premium gear after level 10.\n\nAt first It felt like you could get by with out premium but they start shoving it all up in your face. Eventually you feel like you're falling behind in gear and money so it starts to look tantalizing, then you get into higher levels and you're the only dude without an AK... and then you accidentally leave auto-buy on for the most expensive ammo and you go in debt, leaving you with nothing but starter gear... then the pop ups start with the buy premium button exactly under the confirm button for exiting a match. Don't click too fast.\n\nGood notes:\n\nEven though level design is unbalanced on most maps, the levels themselves are beautifully crafted and incredibly immersive. The level of "God took a dump on the earth one day and russians decided to colonize it" apocalypse and S.T.A.L.K.E.R level of detail is just beautiful. I've never played another shooter that made me feel this way. I absolutely get a kick out of crouching and running through overgrown grass and shrubbery, shooting my mosin through slats in run down cabins (yes, ♥♥♥♥ windows, you can shoot through cracks in the wall). The devs pay beautiful amounts of attention to making it seem believable and making you feel like you're really there. I absolutely love these maps and cannot wait for Free-roam.\n\nThe guns themselves, at least the ones I use (Mosin, Uzi, and Winchester) feel like guns. In call of duty your weapon feels like a feather. There's no repurcusions for firing. You go about with reckless abandon, spraying rounds left and right only to reload in milliseconds. In Survarium every shot is important. Your guns, at least for the beginning levels, are old and heavy and you definitely feel it. It sounds bad but... it feels so right. SMG's have iron sights that, once you start firing, you might as well just not iron sight because dat recoil and flare though... Rifles have a satisfying gun shot noise followed by a plume of smoke that clouds your vision, sometimes obscuring targets, which is neat. You may shoot and miss, but you dont notice them slip off to your left because the gun smoke was in your face Nothing is more satisfying than getting a kill at any range with a mosin. There are shotguns and assault rifles but the only shotgun I've used is the starting shotgun which is utter butt. Don't pull the trigger unless you're close enough to hit them with thing, and in which case don't pull the trigger, just hit them with your double barreled baseball bat.\n\nTl:dr: Suffer through the crap hole of the first ten levels and something fun starts to show up behind the grime and muck of that old familiar russian apocalypse.","April 5, 2015","true","16.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

A few bugs, but mostly just balance and quality of life stuff like having to hold ADS. Movement is a little clunky, but weapons are smooth and sound great! The MMO aspects of character customization are a nice touch and seem to have good depth to set players apart from each other eventually. Game is NOT P2W since nearly everything can be purchased with earned in-game currency. Maps and graphics are as pretty and atmospheric as you would expect from a STALKER game. Graphics could use some optimizing, but that's expected. Overall, it feels way better than any of the latest Zombie crap shoot games built on the Arma mod. The guns and slightly slower gamplay will remind some of the original COD I think. I see great things from Survivarium as long as they keep working hard on it from here. It's F2P so try it for yourself.","April 7, 2015","true","6.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

When this game was released I was totally excited just because it was a stalker type of surving in stalker type of maps. Probably the best thing this game ever got was weapon attachments. Back in old days it was really awesome to play this game because mostly you had to sneak up to surprise your enemies or catch them off guard which was truly something else. But now they added sensors and staff like that so it kinda reminds now like one type of new CoD. They should keep it like it was... stalker type of sneaking survining game. Now the amount of sensors just knock you out, it even forces you to use more sniper rifles because there is no way you can go places if you dont have Tier 9 Antiradar Veil backback. But we´ll see where this game goes... I still keep playing it because I like it even with sensors its totally different than BF4 or CoD. Hopefully they keep their game as a stalker type of game. But hey its a free game atleast and not expensive one. Feel free to try it out and see yourself what this game is truly about and dont feel sad if you dont get it at in couple of matches, this game takes some time to kick in since the shooting is way different than many other games. I wish you all the best of luck in battlefields.","May 22","true","342.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The game at its present point is riddled with hackers and game breaking graphical issues. Apart from that, the movement is okay, the weapons are decent, the UI rivals the tediousness of games like War Thunder, but is managable. I wouldn't suggest getting into this one until the devs crack down on getting hackers out, and hopefully implement an anti-cheat system.\n\nThe sounds in the game are great.

Not pay-to-win.\nWell, that TL;DR is basically explaining you the whole concept of the game: it's a first-person shooter (feels something like a bit slower version of Call of Duty) in Stalker-ish post-apocalyptic universe. You're playing as a survivor in three (as of July, 2015) fast-paced game modes -- Team Deathmatch (or basically "kill 'em all"), Research (where you capture zones and gain points) and some other one, I didn't get to play it yet (it's probably something like Capture The Flag). One match usually continues for 10-15 minutes, in all of the three modes.\n\nGraphics look a bit outdated, so don't expect Battlefield 4 in here. Though, stability is game's strong suit -- it gives 60 fps on a relatively old PC, easily.\n\nI've started playing the game when it was out of beta (after it was released on Steam, didn't play it before), so I have no idea what bugs are people talking about. I did encounter one bug with the scoreboard not showing that one time, but that was it -- one small bug in 3 hours of gameplay. Game looks really smooth and even kind of polished, for v0.29 (which means that it's not fully developed, as I see it).\n\nIt's not a pay-to-win type of F2P shooter (like the new Ghost Recon) -- new equipment won't make you invulnerable. It would make you a little bit more stronger and you'll look cooler, but that is it.\n\nGame balance is something to discuss, yet I've just started playing (got 3 hours in, like I said, at the time of writing the review), so I don't know what happens next. Hopefully, balance stays around the same in the later versions (no weapons are currently dominating the battlefield, nothing's too imbalanced).\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nI like the game progress -- even though the gameplay itself is getting repetitive really fast (like in every other online shooter, as you well know), but the unlocks, factions, achievements and missions are all giving you the reason to stay and play "just one more round".\n\nI have to remind everyone, that the game is not fully released yet, it's still in Early Access -- this implies that a lot of stuff might change later on, so I might change my mind about the game later. Yet, now I'll gladly go and play it some more.\n\nRating: 8.0 out of 10.0","July 4, 2015","true","7.4"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","10","19","0","0"

Well... yeah...? That's kind of what Vostok Games was aiming for.\n\nThere isn't much to offer as far as the story. Actually, there isn't any kind of story whatsoever, but what is promised to come will definitely keep me waiting and kicking ♥♥♥ with a decent sized community in match making.\n\nThere are 3 game types [2 of which you have to unlock], 4 visible factions that offer different weapons and armor depending on which one you join [each faction can be ranked up which unlocks higher level weapons and armor], a clan system and several other intriguing features.\n\nNow, here's where I want everyone reading this to pay close attention to:\n\nThe gaming world is cluttered with several free to play [F2P] and pay to play [P2P] titles. I would have to say that ALL of them have some sort of in-game shop/vendor/currency that you're able to spend real money to have an advantage in some way, shape or form. It's not required. Hell, it's not even necessary to enjoy most games.\n\nAs I've spent the last several hours playing Survarium, reaching level 6 and rank 3 in my faction, I've noticed several reviews, the in-game community and those that haven't even tried the game say that it's pay to win [P2W]. This isn't even remotely true. Most of the people that throw the word pay to win around either hate the developer, had a bad experience or just suck at it.\n\nI haven't spent a dime on this game and I'm enjoying every second of it and it's not even 1/4 of the way developed. It's still in the beta phase! There's so many interesting updates to come and hopefully a fun, healthy and helpful community that comes along with them.\n\nI'm anxious for the future of Survarium, I most definitely give it a thumbs up and recomend everyone that's worried about the mixed reviews to give it a shot!\n\nThanks for reading. :]","April 7, 2015","true","33.8"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","11","21","3","0"

This game features a real-money store, therefore it's as launched as it ever will be. On that note, to obtain all four currently released DLC packs, you have pay nearly 150 EUR. The in-game store is also overpriced.\n\nYou might have heard that this game will eventually have an open world PvE/PvP area. From what I've found, it was supposed to be out years ago and now has been delayed even further, with no official response as to when it might be released. If you're coming here because of that, don't bother waiting. It might as well be vaporware at this point.\n\nAs for the game itself:\n\nWhat do you get when you mix overpromising with slow development? Survarium, apparently. This is a good-looking game, no one can deny that, but when it comes to gameplay, it just falls down face flat. Under the pretty coat of paint is a generic FPS game that pretends to be something more.\n\nPros:\n\n- The artstyle is nice.\n\nCons:\n\n- Clunky controls. Imagine that you're controlling someone in an armour made of cardboard boxes.\n- You might read in-game that camouflaging your outfit is a good idea to stay hidden. It's pointless. The killcam will give away your position anyway.\n- The "realistic" body damage doesn't go far enough. Equip a bandage and it might as well not exist.\n- Spawnkilling. If the enemy team is too strong, they will push you back to your base and kill you the second you spawn.

Actually, I lied. The mostly negetive reviews really clued me in. But ignoring that, the download time was suspicious. I go to launch the game and it boots up an installer. Alright, kind of counter intutive I think but as long as it eventually gets me to the game I think. Wrong. The installer immediately has a bigger fit than an epiliptic overweight mentally handicapped 7 year old child in a candy shop, spamming me with error box after error box. Well, ♥♥♥♥. I uninstall the game and reinstall it. I try to launch it again. The executible is missing now. So after redownloading I had to verify the cache, find out everything was missing, and have to redownload a THIRD time. It's kind of getting old but I'm a fan of the STALKER franchise so I decide to go for the long haul.\n\nTurns out, third time's the charm. The download finished, and the installer successfully installed the launcher. After a handful of small patches I got to launch the game. Alright, finally getting to the action I think. The game boots up and I'm not sure if it's because I'm hung over or the game is actually so atrocious that it made me nausious and gave me a headache. It's not nesicarially that it's graphically bad but it's just so obviously a reskinned Alliance Of Valiant Arms. It's AVA with a STALKER franchise slapped on top. That's it. The UI is also reminiscent of a high-speed 2009 F2P flash game like Evony or its many knockoffs.\n\nI managed to not projectile vomit, and decided to try to actually get in game before really sealing the deal on my opinion. I noticed there was a dumb tutorial with a small reward for completion, but you get no reward for skipping the tutorial, which is kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in my opinion. If you skip it you should get the reward either way, sorry for not being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and needing you to hold my hands to learn a genre I've been playing since 1995, developers. Because I'm a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ though I decide to go along with the tutorial for the reward. I gave my AVAclone character a mosin nagant and launched PVP match making.\n\nThen I waited. And I got hooked up with other players. Then I waited. And waited some more. And waited even longer. Apparently there's not enough servers for this game, they didn't expect so many people to try and play this peice of garbage. 10 minutes later I decide I've had quite enough waiting and I go to exit the game. Except the exit button doesn't work. The developers are literally so incompitent they can't code the exit button correctly. Quality. That's alright though because ctrl+alt+del-ing and forcing the process to end was honestly more satisfying.\n\nOverall I'd rate the game 9/11, good nausia and waiting simulator. Kind of felt like being in the part of the hospital where there's a lot of sick and dieing people, lots of open and infected wounds. Imagine that smell of sterile cleaning products and musky, damp bloody and pus-y injuries hitting your nose at the same time. Glorious.","April 3, 2015","false","0.2"," 30 of 59 people (51%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","51","30","59","8","0"

I have thoroughly enjoyed every minute of playing it and I am very glad to have found it.  The atmosphere and sounds are just phenomenal and it really gives it that Post-Apocalyptic Russia vibe.  This is not a run and gun type game, instead it rewards you for using caution, whether it be patiently waiting to ambush enemy players or sneak throughout the map remaining undetected picking off stragglers.  It caters to a lot of different play styles and allows you to take different approaches in the said play style.\n\nThe only downside is that it is a Beta game. There are bugs and glitches, but that goes to say for most games anyways.  The developers are dedicated and listen to the community.\n\nSo overall, I would have to give Survarium a 8.5~9/10 based on current circumstances.  It is definitely worth your time.  It takes a little patience starting out (learning different mechanics of the game) but in the end it is rewarding.","April 29, 2015","true","64.2"," 34 of 67 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","34","67","3","1"

Shortly, I read very few of objective ones. Since I played this game earlier in closed beta, I've seen gameplay trough all tiers of gear, as well as I played this game in different phases of development. Basically, these are the few points I want to highlight and explain to new members of community.\n\n#1 - Pay to win\n\nLike i wrote above, lot of people mention this factor as main problem of the game. Truth is, there is possibility of buying items with premium currency. Those items come with unique stats and look, but i never found them extremely overpowered since A) almost none of those guns and equipment is effective in higher tier matches and B) even on equal tier u can still get similar or better equipment by regular mechanics.\n\n#2 - Slow development (upcoming free world mode)\n\nThis is second hot topic, from which Survarium gets lot of bad reputation. Lot of players who stick with game for a longer time, like I do, are angry with how slow progress on game development is. I must agree that it was a bit slow earlier, but on the other hand, since open beta VG done lot of changes and patches are coming more often and with more content. I must say that devs posted lot of plans from their "to do list" to the community earlier and since they weren't capable of completing these tasks, lot of people turned their backs on VG. Today I think, VG are more responsible and they do their job in the way they present it to community. From this i assume that the progress will be faster in future and fans of Survarium will get what they are looking for.\n\n#3 - Matchmaking balance\n\nThis is I think the biggest problem of all. Lot of players experience matching with people with lot more skill and are frustrated when getting quickscoped in environment they barely know. Development is aware of this and even upcoming patch (0.28) will adjust matchmaking to be more fair to newcomers.\n\n---\n\nThat's all for now, thank you for reading so far and please, don't be so hard on Vostok Games, i sense great potential in this game and community which supports devs with new ideas would be so much better then community of people picking on them.\n\nGood luck, have fun - Prowler out.","April 8, 2015","true","515.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

To find the source, I looked up and in the direction of the sun to find that there possibly was a person on the roof, and when I finally snuck my way all the way up there, what do you know, some doof was up there; he was swifty gunned down of course, but having found this person not through sound, but entirely by the fact that I saw his shadow for a second, was very satisfying.\n\nAs unfinished games go, I actually enjoyed it, It has tight controls and feels more or less fleshed out, but at this point in time I would not reccomend this game soley because it feels very generic, unfinished and unoriginal at the moment.\n\nI DO however reccomend following the game to see where it goes, whenever progress is made.\n\nBottom line, this game has serious potential and i'm excited to see where that goes.","April 6, 2015","true","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I got into the game and first noticed the amazing environment. The game looks amazing, apart from arma 3 this is the best game looking game I have ever played, although it requires a hell of a pc to run it. Mine is on ultra and runs at 70fps but I have quite a large pc, so the devs really need to apply optimization for older pcs.\nThe gameplay is solid. The guns feel good, I especially like the sounds which sound very real life. Also if you get shot then you do eventually bleed out so the game's realistic in that sense.\nNow for me I found it hard to level up so I don't know but easier level ups? Because I've looked in the shop and there's very cool looking guns but they are all very high levels.\nCustomisation. Theres a hell load of funs from sniper rifles to shotguns, to rifles to smgs and each faction has a few going for it. This is all well and good until you find out that all the really cool looking guns are premium and cost gold. *Sad Face*.\nFinally modes. At the moment there's only team deathmatch. I feel this is only a test environment as you only get to run around a rather small map and shoot other players-standard fps right? Well according to the devs there are going to be pve worlds in the future like dayz or h1z1 which sounds really cool because the game's realistic and the sounds are life like, etc. The only problem is that we don't know the release date for that. After reading the comments and reviews I can see that the devs promised this years ago and it hasn't come out yet. In general updates are slow so thats that.\nNow I hope this helps, I would recommend to try it out because it's quite fun but I wouldn't say to invest in it until the future.\nThanks for reading!","April 6, 2015","true","5.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zealot644/recommended/355840/","zealot644","Zealot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zealot644/","262 products in account","There's something to be had for shooter fans from all different walks. Whether you're playing for the sake of chasing the carrot on the stick (which is really an exaggeration, more on that later), competitive gameplay, or coming along to sight see/explore (it's awfully pretty at times) and experience the inevitable PVE content that has been promised and with the currently designed levels could be easily implemented - It's all here (or soon to be)!\n\nGunplay is tight and efficient, reminiscent of fast paced shooters such as Call of Duty. You get a small handful of weapons to play with based on what you're interested in, a couple of loadouts, and off you go. The biggest customization in this game comes from equipping different sets of gear and decals/materials to them - and there's plenty. You're given ample resources to spend on purchasing new equipment, and almost as fast as your character levels up, so does your faction rankings and bank account. For every new tier of gear you unlock, starting off with only a few matches to do so, it only takes an hour or two at most to reach the next tier - and you have more than enough money if you were careful with it (and performed well) to buy out the entire set of upgraded stuff.\n\nThe world is very well designed, and you'll notice right away just how lush and alive the landscape feels. It's got an otherworldly vibe, but is oddly familiar at the same time. Past the impressive visuals and atmosphere that the game creates, the levels are designed in such a way that clever tactics and exploration are encouraged. Anomalies at various locations add a nice twist, with my personal favorite being the moving electric anomaly on the Vostok Array map, and if you lose track of what you're doing you'd quite quickly mistake yourself to be playing STALKER again. If you've got the gear to resist anomalies, new pathways are opened up for you. If you've got the time and patience to explore the outer reaches of the maps, or explore every nook and cranny, you'll have plenty of alternative routes to take and skirt around the conflict in search of a better vantage point. On top of all that, there's artifacts which can be found in anomalies to give your team temporary bonuses per map - and can be activated for further effects. The artifact gathering aspect is promised to be fleshed out later, so let's see how that goes in the mean time.\n\nAs far as free to play is concerned, I'd hardly know. You make so much money while playing that by the time you reach your next tier within your faction, you'll be able to buy everything - and faction advancement is quick and easy. In about 6 hours of playing I managed to make it all the way to the second highest faction rank, and was having fun the entire way through. Might slow down a bit later, but not by much from what I've experienced thus far.\n\nGame balance as it stands could use some work, with SMG's being very powerful in comparison with other weapons (I'd argue they could use their effective range toned down, along with less accuracy to boot) it's a bit of an SMG spraydown in some matches, but most maps have enough sections with large distances between you and your foe that rifles come to shine in their own right. Shotguns are a very destructive although rather hit and miss type ordeal until you're able to get something that holds more than two shots, and even then you'd better hug some corners because short range is the definite, absolute name of their game. The sawed off side arm which can replace your standard pistol is an absolute blast however, and makes clean up or close quarter battles a breeze when you blow them away with a double tap and lighting fast reload.\n\nAll in all, I like this game. It's solid for what it is, and seeing as there are plenty of changes and new content yet to come - it's something that if it continues to impress me as such I might consider investing some money into. Vostok is doing a pretty good job with what is the spiritual successor to STALKER as far as I'm concerned.","April 5, 2015","true","48.4"," 15 of 30 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","15","30","0","0"

Sure the people who just buy weapons (yes you can buy guns for actual money) can be annoying, but the game is well balanced and very fun to play, with intersting gun mechanics, variety and character customization, the game is very intersting, and I alredy have 16 hours played on it. Bugs are minor, and the maps are very detailed and uniques, as well as an emphasis on good looking textures. Development has been slow, but the gmae is totally worth it, it is free after all. As well as being very fun to play with friends. (Only 3 of you can be in a squad at a time but if you have a high ranked friend you may want to wait and get a little more ranked up as these players will have better armour and guns than you) Over all a great game. 9/10, will play again!","April 12, 2015","true","108.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

As an avid STALKER fan I was happy to see the universe taken in a new direction. It might not be a direct link to the series but it definitely has that feel to it. The only mode available now is the PVP mode which is enjoyable but does come with it's downsides, for example hackers. The game has a pay model similar to War Thunder, which most people may see as pay to win but does also come with a nerf of sorts in which all weapons that aren't the default starting weapons require you to buy ammo for them and repair them when they need it.\n\nOverall I like the game a lot but it does need a lot of polishing before it could be considered feature complete.","April 8, 2015","true","8.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Modifiable variants of all gear can be found in game.\n\nXP boosts are sold at a rate of 20 gold [.20 USD] per 24 hours for %50 extra XP, which can be combined with a premium membership for double XP.  This has no game balance breaking effects since the gear you unlock by leveling will place you in higher rank matches.\n\nOver all its a great FPS that will surely become a shining post-apocalyptic star in what has become a watered down genre.

It’s a pay to grind less\nSome players state this because of a few things, the frustration of seeing that Golden gun (upgraded weapon) that kills them fast that only has slightly better stats (and if you played games such as COD or any other first person shooter where you can die faster than you could say “omfg you piece of-“ You can’t say the rest cause you are dead! ), you know that that 10% damage isn’t going to help so  when you get shot in the ♥♥♥♥ing head with a bolt action sniper, it was not that 10% damage increase, it was you running through the field like a COD player. This game is more of a pay to do less grinding (much like Warframe) because you can still get the same stats (e.g. that 10% damage you people cry about when getting shot up) just like a person who pays Real Life money. However, with Real life money, the weapons/armour you get have a money/xp bonus which is still by the way pay to do less grinding. Either way, a pay to win is a game that you can ONLY PROGRESS FURTHER by PAYING MONEY! So to all those dumbasses out there calling this game a P2W, know what P2W is before you start yapping them ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t spammers!\n\nIt’s a BETA!\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R fans, Curious Gamers and Masters of the Cheeki Breeki, don’t expect too much as this game is still in beta. For those who wanted to fight mutants, do missions in an open world but get angry because that has not came out in a long time realise this, it is SMART to get the pvp balanced out and sorted before going for something so big. Can you imagine how annoying and buggy it can be if they introduced all these functions so soon? Yeah… Besides if you did not realise, most games take quite a while to make, so the longer they take, the better it can be . It’s also got very good graphics and sound (especially the sound!). It also has some very awesome features coming up which I cannot wait to see like open world and such (so when this game is finally out, it won’t be just another COD clone)\n\nDifficulty\nIt is easy to die in this game (just like most fps games). It can be fun, mainly if you fight vs players that are as strong and skilled as you. Also you cannot run around like in COD guns blazing, you do that here in Survarium you get Cheeki Breeki (get shot the ♥♥♥♥ out of you!). So Stealth is a big mechanic in this game. However it can get very unfair! Now imagine this, the matchmaking system is ♥♥♥♥ as you get matched up agents players who have very powerful equipment (not upgraded, but weapons of extreme power!). For example, you (the guy with a rusty pistol and a little bolt action sniper with no scope) get put up vs people with accurate, automatic big guns (LMG) and amazing armour and gear and skill (cause they had to play a long time to get that kind of ♥♥♥♥) and you WILL die S.T.A.L.K.E.R fans, Curious Gamers and Masters of the Cheeki Breeki. But why is the match making so ♥♥♥♥? Because there is not enough players. Gamers get shooed away but the bad reviews and ones that stay fight vs other newbies which can be fun but them as you progress you’ll find yourself fighting stronger people, if not ones that are overpowered! So please! Join Survarium and do you part in improving the match making!\n\nConnection Speed\nNow here is something you guys need to know. If Matchmaking is too slow, you can select more server regions to fasten the matchmaking, however expect your game to lag badly. I am an Oceanic Player, so I have never experienced good ping, NEVER! There are 3 servers to choose from EU, US and RU. The lowest ping I could experience is 350-400 on the US servers. So if you are not from those regions or close to them, expect heavy lag and high ping!\n\nTo Conclude, Survarium is a game with big potential and I recommend it. Because hey, it’s a free-to-play so no harm right?","August 24, 2015","true","81.4"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Going into it as a very fun FPS that I can listen to music and play with good movement, weapons, and amazing maps/atmosphere.\n\nMy first hour in-game showed me that either many "issues" with this game are exaggerated or fixed(OR SIMPLY DONT APPLY TO MY 3 YEAR OLD PC), either way I had no Hitbox/reg problems. Even with a small playerbase it never took me more that 5 minutes to find a match and while I waited I browsed through the extensive skill/weapon/armor customization and it is as impressive as they show it to be. I can only give my experience playing with the sniper rifle and pistol but even only regularly using the sniper rifle I can say weapons that should feel powerful DO(Sniper), and weapons that should be fairly weak, feel fairly weak(basic pistol).\n\nI am currently low level, some complaints about this game suggest certain weapon types become OP as you level up, This could be true but as of right now I would have no way of knowing so I will update this review if I run into any serious issues, for now Im going to casually put some time into this game while it develops.","March 2","true","6.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Now that i've played this game for about 15 hours. I feel like i can write a review. I have beeen looking and following the development of this game ever since it was announced in 2013 promising an open world stalker/ish game. It caught my attention since i'm a long time S.T.A.L.K.E.R fan. Then they decided to introduce a PVP mode instead of the open-world version which disappointed me a little bit, the game still doesn't have the open world game mode but the developers have promised it to come in the future. Now to talk about the PVP mode. Let's start with the Pros: Very addicting, not P2W, fun to play with friends since you can go all tactical in the research mode, a wide variety of weapons and it even has factions, immersive maps it really gives you that post apocalyptic feeling, skills matter, and a good skills/level up system. Cons: Shotguns are way too overpowered, just 7 maps, anomalies are just annoying and doesn't really contribute much to the game. Although the game is really fun and i definetely recommend people that liked the S.T.A.L.K.E.R and the metro series to try this game out. The open world game mode still isn't out but i'm waiting patiently and i have faith in the developers. 7,7/10","March 4","true","16.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

All the fun I had early on has been completley offset by the fact that the team with the most money invested will win. Players who buy heavy armor and a gun become raid bosses. They can simply walk through the center of the map killing until they get to the enemy spawn, then spawn camp until they are finally brought down. Rinse-repeat-win.\n\nAll the interesting mechanics, detailed post apocolyptic settings, and Fallout-y vibe are 100% offset by the fact that the game is unbalanced, and is probably built that way on purpose to get people to buy stuff.\n\nThis game could get better. I think with a little more balance and refinement it could really become a true FPS Fallout/or a CoD version of Stalker...but it probably won't.

Anomalies are extremely overused/overplaced as some kind of "cure-all" for everything from flanking routes to level open-ness, as well as completely replacing the natural hazards in maps such as the scorching hot soil and rock in Mamayez, or the electrified puddles of water in satellite station, that forced you to jump up on top of desks to save your life. Those hazards and the open level feel were the things that drew me to this game and kept me here..I thought it was obvious that anomalies should be as rare as artifacts and found only in the hazardous areas that you completely removed. Instead of in every hallway,doorway, and tunnel, because really they are extremely dangerous to all players, today I saw more deaths from anomaly suicides than I did from enemy players.\n\nI really hope this is experimental and removed soon, because only 1 person out of the 20 that I discussed it with wasn't extremely annoyed by this patch and he was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

At this point in time Survarium has several PvP modes available for you to play.\nFirst up is Scavenge, in this mode 2 teams of 8 players start must sniff around the map for batteries,\nthese spawn in random but fairly predictable locations around the map, some will be out in plain sight,\nand some close to or within the anomaly( I will get to this later) on the map. These must be picked up\nand delivered to a charging station located close to your spawn and indicated on the map, while carrying\nyou are 100% vulnerable, unable to spring or perform any functions aside from moving, jumping and being\nable to drop the battery. There are a total of 10 of them all around the map and you need to have more\non your team's side to win. Mind you while this sounds simple it is much more complicated than that,\nas batteries can be STOLEN by the enemy and vice versa, a common and rather sour strategy is to collect\na "safe" amount of batteries, usually 6 or +2 of whatever the enemy has, and when the countdown reaches\nlow like 10 - 20 seconds depending on the map, people just rush the enemy charger and unplug all batteries.\nNext mode is Charging Stations, in this mode instead of locating the batteries several charging stations are\nplaced within the environment, these randomly but once again fairly predictably spawn a single battery which\nmust be taken to your charging station, once the first battery is spawned they begin spawning subsequently roughly\nonce every 30 seconds.\nThird and the most recently added mode is Research, I personally do not like this mode and avoid it, so go find\ninfo on it somewhere else.\nLast but not least is your traditional Team Deathmatch, no batteries, just pure old fashioned bloodshed with 150\nspawn tickets for each team and 15 minutes of time, whichever runs out first.\n\nFeatures\n\nSurvarium can be played in several different ways, much like the majority of modern day shooters you have access\nto a rather impressive arsenal of weapons and gear, and decent customization to both. At this stage the guns cannot\nbe messed with, ie silencers scopes etc, but that will be added at some point in time. The outfitting customization\nhowever is most impressive, different types of clothing Feet/Legs/Chest/Hands/Face/Head/Back, of these Chest and Head\ncan have changeable cloth types and camo types as well up to 2 player placed decals. You can basically blend into almost\nanything in the game if you know how to do it right, and if not moving you can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ to see, and locate.\nWhile most people think "Ohhh f**king campers everywhere" allow me to assure you that it is not the case as the guns being\nso goddam lethal if you know where to shoot a sniper is rarely stationary, moving place to place as the sound alone will\nattract every enemy within half the map's radius. That pretty much covers the basic stuff. And then there are things like\nTraps, Explosives, Anomalies and Artifacts, oh and soon Mutants. At this point in time the only trap is the Bear Trap\nwhich, if stepped on, will 9/10 times break your legs and cripple you, as well as take a third of your hp, oh and make you\nbleed too, if carefully placed, 2 or 3 traps can be triggered at the same time for an amplified effect, 2 traps will put\nyou into critical condition and make you vulnerable to one hits from most guns, 3 traps will kill you instantly, at lower\nlevels in the game that ammount is less with 2 traps being a killer and a single one being a crippler. Combine these with\nSmoke Grenades (damn the effect in this game is really GOOD) and you have yourself one helluva an advantage knowing where\nthe traps are. Grenades at this point is the only explosive, BUT, holy ♥♥♥♥ is it good, you can run and hide from them\nbut if cooked to perfection only an activated Onyx artifact has a small chance of saving you, you will still be bleeding\nfrom every single body part there is and will need medical attention. The Anomalies in this game are present on most\nbut not every map, Cologne Bridge for example does not have Anomalies and therefore does not have Artifacts. Anomalies\nare either Gaseous, Radioactive, Toxic and Electric in nature, each one will affect you differently and at different speeds\ndepending on your outfitting, with some requiring only a small amount of protection to enter, you will use antitoxins\n90% of the time when you are interracting with one, these help you live through the anomaly without dying in seconds.\nOnce inside one you will gradually take anomaly damage, this is indicated by the visual change on the screen, everything\nwill begin to shift in colors and focus ranges as well as tube like vision effects, basically like some good ACID. Once\nthis reaches a certain point you will die in a blink of an eye regardless of HP. So WHY would one seek entry in such a\ntreacherous place? 2 reasons, one being the fact that anomalies are cleverly placed, they are usually blocking off the\nfastest/safest path to the enemy base or otherwise cut off access to certain locations, and then there are Artifacts.\nThese little bad boys are a real gamechanger, there is a total of 6 different types of artifacts with different passive\nand active effects to complement a variety of playstyles. From damage reducting Onyx or movement enhancing Spring to\nmy personal favourite the Sponge, which soaks up anomaly damage passive, and can be thrown in a form of a toxic gas\ngrenade. Best part of it, the passive AND active effects can all stack, both with one another and with themselves.\nAside from that there your obvious med kits and bandages and items called "Rations", these occupy one equipment slot\nand are consumed at the start of the round, giving the user a solid boost to a certain factor of the game, depending\non what you ate. They are however rather costly, especially for newbies, so I suggest you stay away until you have a\nmil silver floating around unused.\n\nSetting\n\nSurvarium is set in a world where mother nature has had enough of your ♥♥♥♥, and decided to give us humans the boot up\nthe ♥♥♥ and kicked us out of cities and homes while casually murdering the majority of human population. Once she'd had\nenough people began to emerge and blah blah blah blah and you know, now we wanna kill each other because there is nothing to\ndo and the world is a complete sausage-fest. The environment around you is overgrown and ravaged by nature, grass is up to\nyour nuts, some trees reach to the skies, and buildings are now just a gloom, pale and lifeless memory of what once was\nour home, and when no guns are firing the sound of clarity fills the air. From distant birds to the sound of wind crossing\nthe halls of a School. In short, the atmosphere is nothing short of breathtaking, the sounds just bleeds into the atmosphere\nmaking you feel like you are really there. All that, generously painted with Vostok's very own engine, designed specifically\nfor this purpose.\n\nThese are the biggest points of the game, everything mentioned above is the "Good". Now we move onto the "Bad".\nLike many other online shooters the game suffers from ping. At this point in time there are no Oceanic servers, which\nmakes it painful to enjoy the game, but with proper configs I was able to achieve playable ping and could kick ♥♥♥ at\nleast half the time. The game is VERY ping dependent, so if you are not close to the currently available servers I suggest\nto not play until there domestic servers near you, as high ping will CERTAINLY ruin your experience.\nThen there is a very big question of Pay To Win. Some would say that the game is completely free, other people will say\nthat it's P2W. I think it is neither. On one hand you have the choice to play for free, you will have access to everything\nthere is in game, except for purchaseable camos/decals","April 2, 2015","true","231.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","1"

The game has potential to be something special, but the development is slow and the PVE "freeplay" that drew me to the cocept does not seem to be coming any time soon (no news on that at all recently). That said, the team at Vostok is active and communicates with the community several times a month. Since its free, there is no reason not to try this game -- I have had fun with it so far. Most of my "cons" are things Vostok will likely fix at some point.\n\n-- 6.5/10 --\n\nPros:\n-Decent gunplay\n-Pay-to-win factor is low\n-Cool artifact system\n-Good S.T.A.L.K.E.R. vibe\n-Interesting faction progression with tons of unlocks\n-Nice visuals\n-Match-end mystery drop is always fun\n-Not very many bugs for an early access game\n\nCons:\n-PVE "freeplay" mode still pending (slow development on that end)\n-Character animations/movement as seen from 3rd person are pretty rough\n-Weapon balance pass needed (automatics are far and away superior to anything else)\n-PvP gameplay has little varriety between the three game modes so progression can become tedious\n-Its not S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 -- I know the devs are sick and tired of hearing this, but it's what I really want.","August 16, 2015","true","40.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

You jump around like you're in space.\n\nAlmost every single kill is usually from bleeding to death, and not actually being shot.\nYou will get low FPS if you don't have a decent computer which makes me poop on the toilet and makes a loud splash at night. The graphics are like getting a wet kiss on the cheek from your grandmother at a family gathering.\n\nSurviarium has two "I" s. I is pronounced "Eye" when said out loud. Eye has 3 letters. a Triangle also has 3 sides. Survarium has 10 letters. illuminati has 10 letters.

The atmosphere is spot on, the ambient sounds, the looks, the aesthetics are just perfect. It really helps you immerse yourself in the game.\n\nThe gameplay is very different from what I'm used to. It's less of a Call of Duty-style twitch shooting, and more of a game where you actually feel like you're fighting for survival. Team coordination is key, and you'll experience some pretty Hollywood-like moments here and there when someone rescues you from enemy gunfire or the other way around.\n\nSo far the game shows lots of potential, but as of yet it is severely lacking in terms of content. I feel like there should be more modes which are much more survival oriented, more character progression and more story content. For example, you're asked to choose a faction to side with, but the thing is that you're never given a description of these factions, what their motives are, what they do, why would I want to join them? This is something which needs to be taken care of IMMEDIEATELY.\n\nAnother thing is the optimisation. It outright sucks balls. I'm getting an absolutely horrible framerate, and I wouldn't really say that the graphics justify that, considering that it looks like a PS3 launch title. And the motion blur is just awful - it's like you're drugged at all times, turn it off completely.\n\nSo far, Survarium is not the greatest game ever, definitely. But, you can give it the benefit of it being in Early access and turn a blind eye for some of the missing functions. Plus, it's free, so you really lose nothing besides HDD space.\n\nI'm excited to see what becomes of this game in the future.","April 12, 2015","true","0.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Though the matchmaking does suck every now and again with putting a high ranked player in with lvl 5's, the majority of the time ive done just fine with no armor and only stock weaponry. I feel like the only time those real money weapons will be of value is near level cap...but if im still playing this then ill drop them ten bucks to continue my good time. The ingame currency is actually really plentiful and most all guns are bought with that anyway. the factions system is really cool--it gives you something to work toward that most other f2p shooters dont really do and the skill tree is pretty unique to an fps shooter. The game itself looks really good, the atmosphere is there. The sounds of the weapons is also top notch.

Dont trust the anomalys, for the love of god.\nIn all seriousness the game has its fair share of bugs but none are that overwhelming in the sense that they dont break the game.\nThats right... there are NO game breaking bugs.\nSurvarium is also tailored to those who have played the STALKER games and like that whole "Anomalys will screw you up" stuff. Survarium is a team based shooter set in a apocalyptic world filled with other people who want you dead. The guns crack out and the ambinat sound casued by them really makes the maps feel like it is two teams vying for control. The gamemodes are as follows, TDM team death match which is kill the other team over and over to win. Research, control points that require capturing and holding to gain points to win. And a capture the flag mode which very few people wish to play for some reason. Any ways the game pushes you in with either a Mosin nagant, a PPsh 41, or a winchester lever action and a few med packs to stop bleeding.\nPros:\nFun leveling\nThe guns are punchy and sound great\nUnique maps that change with the addition of deadly anomalys\nGear customization and asthetics are pleasent and satisfying\nMatchmaking is not an *****\nNo (Almost) hackers if that none are really there to ruin it\nF2P with a purpose and very little Pay 2 win stuff. (All of the Pay 2 Win stuff is worse than the highlevel credit bough stuff anyways\nCons:\nInternet connection is the only real problem\nSome hit detection issues but nothing that made me throw the game away.\n\nThe game also has a faction system where you unlock different gear and weapons based on the faction you pick, I find them all to be pretty rewarding in their own way.\nOverall this game is heading in the right direction and should be something you want to check out. Its free so there is nothing to lose in downloading it.\nGive it a try and if you dont like it just keep playing anyways becasue the longer you play the more rewards you get.","July 1, 2015","true","9.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Not really sure where the mixed reviews have come from at all. Give this a try and i guarantee you'll be addicted after an hour or so. The combat is fantastic and the maps are really well designed. The game does need a few tweaks with damage balancing but nothing major. There is a survival mode incoming that sounds really exciting, I just hope they will add in attachments for weapons at some point too. If you dont mind a levelling up system then you honestly will never need to spend a penny on this game either as you get ingame currency to pay for armour and weapons that upgrade with each higher rank you become.

Game modes are quite simple and nothing really new, but in my opinion the map design is really nice and the areas are huge! it sometimes is annoing if things change and for example your guns get nerfed from one to another day or your ranks you already had inside a certain faction are now resetted/ignored and your cant buy your unlocked items anymore, but thats probably something you cant avoid during beta state. The pay2win factor is not as bad as in other games and i hope those things get removed once the game gets released fully.","January 11","true","23.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game is running really well on my PC, and I've only had one crash on 30+ matches. And all I had to do was close the game down and start it up again, and I was in the match again.\nThe game is a FPS mix of stalker and call of duty. The maps are stalker'ish large and beautiful with lots of places to ambush the opponents. And it's flaws are COD'ish as it's possible to camp spawn and matches can be very uneven.\nI've had a ton off fun playing this game so far, but I'm also good at FPS's. So that the opponent has better weapons and equipment than me on the ranked matches is just a challenge. And nobody is forcing you to do the ranked matches before you have lvl'ed you faction up and gained access to the better weapons.\n","May 29, 2015","true","668.3"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

The matchmaking makes it possible for highly skilled players(with maxed out profile) to play on level 0, so they know the map and all the noob things you'll do, being the first time you play the game. So you will die alot and alot more, but if you can power pass that you may find that its not even worth trying to get to the next level. as you can just "chill" on level 0 and ♥♥♥♥ the noobs over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.\n\n\nBut if you think your skill is more than that, feel free to go get killed by some really OP players, as you on level 3 WILL get matched with level 5-6 players, doesn't sound bad right? till you find the traps they can set and you can't or the super OP weapons  or the abillity to not die when shot at point blank.\n\n\nI really tried to play as much of the game as i could before i gave a review and i got to level 4-5 and could not keep going. Its not worth it even for a free game.\n\n\nI think this game is good but i won't recommend it.","August 2, 2015","false","85.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Going into it as a very fun FPS that I can listen to music and play with good movement, weapons, and amazing maps/atmosphere.\n\nMy first hour in-game showed me that either many "issues" with this game are exaggerated or fixed(OR SIMPLY DONT APPLY TO MY 3 YEAR OLD PC), either way I had no Hitbox/reg problems. Even with a small playerbase it never took me more that 5 minutes to find a match and while I waited I browsed through the extensive skill/weapon/armor customization and it is as impressive as they show it to be. I can only give my experience playing with the sniper rifle and pistol but even only regularly using the sniper rifle I can say weapons that should feel powerful DO(Sniper), and weapons that should be fairly weak, feel fairly weak(basic pistol).\n\nI am currently low level, some complaints about this game suggest certain weapon types become OP as you level up, This could be true but as of right now I would have no way of knowing so I will update this review if I run into any serious issues, for now Im going to casually put some time into this game while it develops.","March 2","true","6.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The weapon and skill  progression is fine. The thing that makes this unplayable is the matchmaking. You will be matched depending what your highest equipped gear is. No matter what bonis you farmed for your weapons and armor or what  bonis you get from your player level. This means that you face people with maxed out gear while you try to earn your first armor part that fits your gun level. The Bonis those equipments have might be small but in addition to the Character skills and the amount of parts  you have ... it  adds up fast. So not only do you try to fight people that play the game for years and want to farm easy money on newbies but they are also WAY better equipped. It gets worse ! Cause of the small playerbase you get at least 2 lvl higher geared Opponents you can play target for.\nGood News is you dont have to play as often cause the waiting time between matches is very long.\nIf they implement a better system it could be a good game until then look somewhere else.\n\n\n","January 29","false","27.3"," 15 of 30 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","15","30","4","1"

Modifiable variants of all gear can be found in game.\n\nXP boosts are sold at a rate of 20 gold [.20 USD] per 24 hours for %50 extra XP, which can be combined with a premium membership for double XP.  This has no game balance breaking effects since the gear you unlock by leveling will place you in higher rank matches.\n\nOver all its a great FPS that will surely become a shining post-apocalyptic star in what has become a watered down genre.  As stated above this review is of version 0.29 of the game, but if the developers keep going the way they are this game will be fantastic by completion.  It already contains more depth and mechanics than your average AAA shooter.","July 15, 2015","true","70.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Now that i've played this game for about 15 hours. I feel like i can write a review. I have beeen looking and following the development of this game ever since it was announced in 2013 promising an open world stalker/ish game. It caught my attention since i'm a long time S.T.A.L.K.E.R fan. Then they decided to introduce a PVP mode instead of the open-world version which disappointed me a little bit, the game still doesn't have the open world game mode but the developers have promised it to come in the future. Now to talk about the PVP mode. Let's start with the Pros: Very addicting, not P2W, fun to play with friends since you can go all tactical in the research mode, a wide variety of weapons and it even has factions, immersive maps it really gives you that post apocalyptic feeling, skills matter, and a good skills/level up system. Cons: Shotguns are way too overpowered, just 7 maps, anomalies are just annoying and doesn't really contribute much to the game. Although the game is really fun and i definetely recommend people that liked the S.T.A.L.K.E.R and the metro series to try this game out. The open world game mode still isn't out but i'm waiting patiently and i have faith in the developers. 7,7/10","March 4","true","16.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"
