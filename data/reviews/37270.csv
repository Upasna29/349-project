It plays kind of like a casual MMO, with the majority of the gameplay involving simple quests for the townsfolk. If you're in the mood to pick berries and make clothes for yourself and others, you could do far worse than this game.\n\nThe characters and storylines are simple, but effective, and - much to my surprise - they can actually be pretty funny. The game uses a lot of internet humor, but I don't mean copy+pasted memes. One of the main characters repeatedly disturbs others with his sexual deviance (dressing up as a furry is only the beginning), and another gets addicted to an MMO. I found these things to be an amusing surprise when I was just looking for a simple game to fill a few hours with easy mindless clicking.","March 15, 2013","true","18.3"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

In order to do this, you must perform tasks for the natives, which usually involve crafting or cooking various items for them, or delivering items to someone else. Rather than climbing trees or digging for things yourself, you use one of the many animals roaming the island to do it for you. As the animals level up, they can climb higher trees, dig tougher rock piles, and fight stronger...other animals, for the items they drop. Sometimes, they will drop an egg, which you can hatch into a new friend. Collect them all!\n\n","January 2, 2015","true","26.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

It's cute. There is mild humor, and mostly you will direct whatever pet you have active to dig, climb, or make friends with other pets. You'll farm, kinda. You'll walk all over the place but the mini-map allows you to click on your destination and go fix yourself a snack while your character self navigates. If you happen to get engrossed in your show, your character will sit on the map, amusing itself contentedly.\n\nI tend to play more intense games on consoles; my computer is for keeping my fingers busy while I"m watching TV. This game was absolutely perfect.\n\nI'm gonna put it this way: have you ever downloaded one of those cute little freemium apps for your phone, played for an hour, fallen in love with the simple little story, the one dimensional NPC's, and the collections you need to complete, then suddenly BOOM! "Invest $5 daily or it'll be so slow it ain't worth it" happens?\n\nThis game gives a similar experience, but with no BOOM!GIVE MORE MONEH! experience. You simply....interact with the one dimensional NPC's, do tasks for them, collect, collect, and then collect some more, do all the little tasks, and chill.\n\nReminds me more of Tamadochi Life than of Animal Crossing, but it was enjoyed by myself, my 6 year old, my 8 year old, and my friend got it for her 13 year old who has completed it twice, so I guess it's a hit!","September 10, 2015","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
