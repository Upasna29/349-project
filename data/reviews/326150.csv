You will kill countless enemies in your quest to get to a kickass concert! I will add a TL;DR at the end.\n\nGameplay\nYou are Mark Skid and you have one goal and one goal only; to get to a kickass concert only 666 Km away. The fun part is you have to go through route 666 where it’s killed or be killed. You will fight Cops, Aliens, Neo-Nazi's, Religious people, Crazy costumed people, Groupies, Rednecks, and Robots. The game starts you off simply having to destroy an easy defenseless car by ramming it to the side. You then head to the shop where you can pick up new allies (hitchhikers), buy weapons, buy car upgrades, heal your crew, upgrade your crew, get contracts for $$$, buy special items, and get tickets to the concert. You upgrade your car and your allies along with their weaponry to become better and kill everyone in your way. Along the road you will find special areas and shops such as Russian roulette, a special weapons shop, a mad science lab, a gun workshop, slot machines, and Zugtar who will either help you or screw you over. As you play you will unlock more cars and get a good total death count which you can use to buy bumper stickers (boosts for multiple things). The bosses will sometime screw you over if you prepared for the wrong boss or you just get unlucky. The game seems to like to play with luck as sometimes you may be able to beat a boss easily but get crushed by a car with saws at its side or you gamble and lose everything. The game is extremely challenging with permanent death and tough enemies. There is more than one gamemode available to play.\n\nGraphics/Sound\n\nWhile you are driving the graphics are more pixelated and when you enter a shop or area it's a trashy design (in a good way) that you see. The sound is well done with the weapons and car smashing. The music is just Punk, Rock, or Metal and really got me into the mood of killing hundreds of enemies blocking my path to that concert.\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ Bumper stickers give you advantages\n+ Music suits the gameplay\n+ Permadeath (always a challenge)\n+ Easy to jump into\n+ Apocalyptic setting\n+ Car combat is exciting and fun\n+ Each ally and car is different\n+ Overall design\n\nCons\n\n- Easy to get screwed over with bosses and enemies\n- Lernie (:D)\n- Luck plays a humongous part in it where at some points it felt like my luck with a boss, enemy, or items available for purchase screwed me over\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI hated the game and loved it. I hated how easily I died but loved going into the game and truly having a challenge to face. I enjoyed it and was able to just jump right back in. This game was quick paced and extremely well designed. While I still haven't reached the halfway point (as of yet) it was still fun as hell. There were more than a few times when I was screwed over with my gambling luck. Overall it was an enjoyable yet rage-inducing experience where I have learned to kill all groupies.\n\nTL;DR\nDeath Skid Mark is a well done rogue-like, action, rpg, car combat game. You are Mark Skids and you are going to get to a kickass concert and kill anyone who gets in your way. As you travel down route 666 to the concert you will pick up allies, upgrade your ride, and get weapons. Before you reach the concert you will die, kill, die again, kill, and die again. There are Slots, Russian roulette, mad science labs, gun workshops, powerful weapons shops and Zugtar who will help you or screw you over.  The game has permanent death but allows you to have a total death count which you can use to buy bumper stickers to help you out. Overall the game is well-designed and definitely worth a look at.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","August 21, 2015","true","11.5"," 80 of 90 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","80","90","4","10"

Between the crazy wonderful art, dark humour and the bangin' soundtrack, you will be coming back for more and more, despite the game's brutal bosses handing you your ♥♥♥ on several occasions. There is a certain addictiveness to driving about with a bunch of misfits going to a metal concert and kicking everyone out of their way to do so.\n\nA rogue-like game that will start you off slow and then throw you right into the fire on several occasions, you might want to smash your keyboard, but, as I've said, will keep coming back. The game's charm is great and, with the cartoony graphics, throws you back to the retro gaming years - in a good way!\n\nAll in all, if you desire a game that does not require you to spend countless hours on just to get somewhere, you like quirky, dark humour, this is for you. I can honestly say I'm loving every part of it. Except the 'getting kicked my face in by a boss'! But hey, that's part of the game and, in time, you will learn to beat those bosses as well.\n\nGo get 'em!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP3yAQq4XU4&index=1&list=PLIhNUXJ4teccn4jGaFP9imVLbrzbiTa_y","November 21, 2014","true","47.3"," 64 of 75 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","64","75","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Richandsteamy/recommended/326150/","Richandsteamy","Tom "Cash4Gold" Guycot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Richandsteamy/","546 products in account","To put it shortly, this game is an amazing roguelike with a even more amazing aesthetic.\n\nDeath Skid Marks is a bit like a top down, real time Faster Than Light.  You drive a vehicle on a post apocalyptic vertical highway, getting into combat with all manner of other drivers.  All to get to a concert.\n\nThe game has a real white trash punk art style and attitude, and it works extremely well for it.  The actual playfield graphics are a little simple, but have personality to them.  What really sells the art style is the menu and rival graphics.  The character art is vibrant and crazy without veering too far off into caracature territory.  Sort of like Rat Fink meets Ren and Stimpy on a heavy metal concert poster.  The art style is very love it or hate it, but most people I've noticed seem to love it.  And I absolutely love it.\n\nThe music is thematically similar.  It's all rock and thrash, and it's loud.  Actually, it's too loud.  A lot of the audio is static-y and overamplified, and the audio quality suffers a bit as a result.  It's one of the few games I've actually had to turn down in the menu just for the sake of playing it.  That being said, it does fit the mood.\n\nThe actual gameplay is reminiscent of old top down, vertical car racing games.  The actual game controls with the WASD to move, and mouse to shoot and use some special attacks.  The gameplay is entirely combat with other vehicles, played somewhat similarly to Faster Than Light, with similar difficulty and similar systems to pay attention to.  Your vehicle has health in four different quadrants, and if any one quadrant hits zero, you are done for.  You also have passenger health to watch out for.  Depending on what and where you are being hit, your passengers can be hurt directly.  You can run other drivers off the road, shoot or melee the car up, or do the same to the occupants.  There's also occasional road hazards that can harm or kill you, like debris, road contruction, or helicopters and suicide bombers.  With certain enemies, your plan of attack changes.  It starts out pretty simple, but it quickly ramps up.  And unlockable vehicles change your attack and defense abilities even further.\n\nMuch like Faster Than Light, progression often depends on upgrades, and you can often miss out on needed upgrades thanks to the RNG.  When you start the game, you generally need to have a good idea how you wish to upgrade your vehicle and passengers.  And the upgrades generally need to follow a set pattern.  In some situations, it's rather difficult if not impossible to survive if you haven't upgraded in a certain way.  The unlockable vehicles actually simplify this a bit, by generally following a set gimmick for the vehicle that gives you a preferred way to attack.  But it's still likely you might get stopped midway through a run because you don't have the manuverability or firepower to survive an encounter.\n\nOn that note, comes the weakest part of the game for me, the bosses.  For the most part, the bosses are bullet spongy and follow set patterns that generally aren't that threatening.  And another issue I have with them is they don't always react to damage at all.  For the first several hours I wasn't sure I was damaging some bosses.  Some of the bosses do show damage on them, and degrade over a fight.  Which makes it more confounding fighting the bosses that show no damage at all, save for maybe scorch marks.  And some of the bosses can only be hurt in certain ways.  Basically, I ended up just giving up on some runs because I didn't know if I could even damage the boss, and what even did damage the boss.  I guess what I'm asking for is more visible damage, less boss hp, and make the bosses hit a bit harder.  And I wish the boss patterns weren't so rote.  Even of the couple end bosses I've fought had a generally bland, slow pattern of attack.\n\nThe actual combat while on the road is much more compelling at least, and that is the bulk of the game.  There's also stops on the road where you can get stat bonuses, like playing Russian Roulette, being experimented on, gambling, or slapping weapons together.  The Russian Roulette game tends to yield the best results, since it's a hard 50/50 chance to get 8 stat points, and you can generally pick up another replacement hitchhiker in case that volunteer takes an accidental bullet to the head.  The actual money you earn is better off spent on vehicle upgrades and weapons first off.\n\nThe game isn't perfect.  The bosses are the one part that really mars the game for me.  But there are vehicles that can chesse some bosses, so that alleviates it a little bit.  As a whole though, I recommend that game whole heartedly.  So long as the boss battles don't frustrate you, you'll find a hard as hell but amazingly fun game worth sinking a few good hours into.  Also there's apparently a free content patch coming out tomorrow, so there's that too.  So I'd say pick this one up.","February 19, 2015","true","19.4"," 35 of 37 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","35","37","0","0"

While the game's blatantly juvenile sense of humour and ham-fisted pool of refereces definitely isn't going to be everyone's kind of humour, there is simply no denying how addictive it is to try and get as far into the game as possible, as well as how satisfying it is to take down enemy vehicles along the way by ramming them off the road. If you're looking for something to play to simply pass short periods of time, wihle still being potentially addictive enough for longer play sessions, I would absolutely recommend this one.","November 22, 2014","true","4.2"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","32","36","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arglefuckerybargle/recommended/326150/","arglefuckerybargle","Your Best Friend","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arglefuckerybargle/","180 products in account","Mentally check these off as you read.\n1. Do you like (slightly) toned down South-Parkian humor?\n\n2. Do you like (slightly) toned down bullet-hells?\n\n3. Do you like the idea of playing the same game over and over ten times, always failing in some regard but learning and still having a fun time in the process?\n\n4. Do you like great rocking tunes and hand-drawn art that fit the mood of smashing a Nazi filled car into a fire-spewing robot and watching them both explode in a glorious union of metal, fire, and meat?\n\nIf you like two or more of those, then get this game, and you'll learn to love the rest right fast. Here's some quick explanations:\n\n1. The humor is  quite good, in an evil sort of way. Just three of your reoccuring enemies are Neo-Nazis, Inbred (some are pigs and ♥♥♥♥ing CORNCOBS, how does that even happen?!) hillbillies, and scary-girlfriend-level possesive groupies, all hellbent on killing something. Along with that is the random name generator, every enemy and ally will have differnet names, from the quirky to the absurd. (I actually saw a priest named Lester the Molester.) Along with the goofy looking art and the limited but funny voice acting, it throws some pretty funny stuff. Also, I should mention that nearly every thing in the game is a reference, but the good kind. For example, nearly every car is based off of a famous one, like truck from Duel, or the rocket powered race car from Deathrace. You can even kill Chuck Norris and the Teletubbies evil, unemployed bretheren.\n\n2. Now, bullet hell may be a bit of a stretch. It's more, 'There will be bullets, but instead of dodging everything that moves like you're a balloon in a fishhook factory, you should go and headbutt those hooks and show them who's the real ♥♥♥♥♥.' You will shoot bullets, the enemy will shoot bullets, but it's not just sliding back and forth, you use your car as a weapon. You'll learn when to hit and when to miss, and it turns into a lovely display of carnage.\n\n3. This is the first time I'll make a reference to FTL, there's another coming up. You will die a whole lot. At the time of this writing, I haven't won the game yet. May it be one of the bosses, or just a tough stretch, you'll get ♥♥♥♥ed up. A lot. But there's three things that draw you back. First, because you're a ♥♥♥♥ing man and you want to win, second, achievments in game unlock new cars, which really change the playing style, and third, your kill count in your past games become a 'currancy' of sort, which allows you to buy early bonus's in later rounds, like hints on a boss and more starting money.\n\n4. Here's that second FTL callback, the music is fantastic. I'd dare say it's on par with FTL, Braid, and Binding of Isaac (the original) in the sense that it fits perfectly with the game. The headbanging punk metal and great bass playing alone will turn you into a season mullet-wearing road warrior. Add on some truly personality-filled art that keeps all the characters, allies and enemies, fresh looking, and it all wraps up as a wonderful game.\n\nSure there are a few problems, just little things that I would have differently, but I haven't come across any game breaking bugs, and there seems to be promise of more great stuff from these developers. So yes, I really recommend this game, it's a bullet-ridden Camero's load of fun.\n\nEDIT: I finally beat it after 16 combined hours of trial and error, and I'm no where close to being bored playing this game. Protip- The ranged damage stat of the driver effects the amount of damage the Red Rocket Dog's flame cause.","December 27, 2014","true","27.6"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","24","25","2","6"

The visuals are gritty, vulgar, and generally hilariously exaggerated either through blood and viscera or goofy stereotypes gone horribly wrong. The music and sound effects are pretty fitting for a highway drive full of wanton destruction and I never felt like they were getting on my nerves at any point.\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, gameplay is akin to Spy Hunter in that you race down a highway full of other drivers either trying to kill you or getting in your way. Along the way, you can pick up additional characters (hikers) that can be armed with a variety of ranged or melee weapons, shot up with drugs to improve stats, or used as guinea pigs in science experiments or Russian roulette (also to improve stats, but with a chance of failure/death).\n\nBy the way, this game is really, really hard. Chances are, you will probably get ♥♥♥♥ed over by RNG dozens of times during your first few hours of playing the game as every possible thing is randomized: store inventories, hitchhikers present, enemies spawned, and bosses encountered, you name it. This can, unfortunately, result in runs that are impossible to win (like getting sawblade groupie without a good ranged weapon or brain tank without good enough melee). In that way, DSM really reminds me of FTL’s habit of randomly giving you the shaft and forcing you to restart, which can be kind of a bummer if you’ve been having a really good session and believe me, it can be absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing frustrating to get 75% of the way through the game and get obliterated by some enemy who just happened to be the perfect counter to your build.\n\nAll in all, the overall atmosphere and fun-factor behind Death Skid Marks kept me coming back again and again, even though playing it was like getting randomly kicked in the ♥♥♥♥, so there’s something to be said about that. This game is a must-have for anyone who enjoyed playing FTL but wanted a lot more action, violence, and ridiculous humor.\n","October 17, 2015","true","16.1"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

The pixel graphics during gameplay, while similar to many other indie titles, look great. The art style for the characters is even better, I can imagine the artist behind them was just told to make them look as grotesque as possible (but in a comical way).\n\nThe gameplay is is at first nice and simple and easy to grasp, but after a few miles of feeling like the king of road rage, the game suddenly starts throwing groups of three enemies and bosses at you. This is where you start to die, and have to think more carefully about upgrades and who you have in your crew.\n\nThere is already a good handful of weapons, hitchhikers, and vehicle and character upgrades, however I do hope that the developers keep adding new content, as there is potential for them to do so. Basically, if you like retro-style rogue-likes and a good challenge, you can't go wrong with this little gem.","November 23, 2014","true","5.6"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JustinBrett/recommended/326150/","JustinBrett","Justin_Brett","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JustinBrett/","786 products in account","So I've played this game for a while and had a lot of fun with it, so I decided to throw up a review and explain to other people why I did, since it's quite a nice little title.\n\nDeath Skid Marks is essentially an action game that puts you behind the steering wheel of Mark Skids, a metal-head that wants to go to an awesome concert. Simple enough, right? But unfortunately this particular concert is at the tail end of Route 666, a highway to hell infested with trigger-happy police, crazed skinheads, holier-than-thou fundamentalists, and most dangerous of all, southerners. To defend yourself you'll need to pick up hitch-hikers such as an Alien, a PTSD'd Army Officer, a Hippie, and a shout-out to the Angry Video Game Nerd, to name just a few. Load them up with weapons, get your stories straight for afterward, and make some memories or die trying.\n\nThe gameplay is simple but satisfying. You control whatever car you've selected for that run (there are quite a few, all with their own abilities and disadvantages), fighting against enemy cars as they come at you from above or below the highway. Blow them up or kill all the passengers and you move onto the next section of highway, from a choice of two options. It's simple at first, with you being able to just ram them off the road easily, but soon passengers are required. Most of them have a bonus in one or two areas, and the Alien in particular is good at everything. Which crewmembers the game gives you is random, of course, so you have to adapt. Sometimes a crew of mostly guns would be good, sometimes all melee is the better option.\n\nThings get more complicated later, with multiple enemies and hazards becoming more frequent, such as suicide bombers or guys by the side of the road firing rockets at you. This is part of where the game's difficulty comes in, as despite appearing like a simple action game it actually expects you to plan ahead: Mark and the rest of his crew can take jobs to earn money, such as by destroying a car or killing enemies with certain weapons. The game flat out says you won't be able to finish the game without upgrading the car and your crew, and it isn't lying at all. You can't afford to spend money on just one thing in particular, and you can often find yourself wondering if getting this weapon is worth potentially passing up some car upgrades that could be in the next shop.\n\nThe difficulty in general might not be for everyone, as I've only beaten the game a few times. Typically when I've died though, it didn't feel like the game was being cheap about it, and you learn from your mistakes. Defeating certain bosses, of which there are a good few, usually unlocks a new car, and getting the good ending with a crew member always does, so if you persevere the game does reward you. I'd say Death Skid Marks is worth it full price, but if it goes half off or more, definitely pick it up if you want an action game with good controls, pleasant combat and a lot of replayability.","May 1, 2015","true","26.9"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","1"

Regardless, a very solid roguelike game that's a good value for 10 bucks. You get a great variety of combat options whether it be through the different cars, the ranged versus melee combat, or the different enemies that you will face. The combat is fast and makes you react quickly to your surrondings, and you really feel every upgrade that you make to your car and crew by the time you're in the heat of battle. While the game does have some drawbacks with some UI elements that sticks out at times, but these small elements don't do enough to overshadow the great combat system and all the fun that the game brings. If you ever wanted to re-enact your fantasies of Mad Max like car combat in a 2D plane, this game is right up your alley.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhKdEiQ5As\n\nLists:\n+:\nGreat risk and reward mechanics in most cases. Reasons to go for things like the Russian Roulette at appropriate times.\nGame has the variety for the different combat styles. In fact, variety is good all over the place in this case. Pushing opponents off screen, push into walls, use the burner on specific cars, etc. Ranged vs Melee, Car type, your passengers, they all make a difference. Even after 7+ hours, finding new things and enjoying my time with them.\nA good hint at a great game is the little details. Things like killing the driver, and the passenger in the back grabbing the steering wheel and showing it visually with him laying his body across the seats: I loved this little touch, and it's stuff like that shows the commitment to detail.\nLike the hazards placed, changed gameplay enough that you had to focus on them.\nLike the job system for the upgrade system. Good change up to really take advantage of the variety of the combat and different mechanics of the game.\nGood selection of music of the rock and metal genres.\nRidiculous art style  that works for the game. Good detail in the character portraits, and enjoy the pop culture references. This can tell the story without directly telling it.\nDifficulty is great for a roguelike. Good progress as you learn the mechanics and get comfortable with them. What you should expect from the genre.\n-:\nThe game could do a better job of displaying information about items, as you'll have to rely on your memory at times to remember what something specifically does.\nSome UI elements can feel tacked on at the last minute, as it doesn't work with the rest of the art style. Looks pasted on in fact.\nThe random events at time can really switch the balance too far one way.\nThose who get motion sick, watch a couple of videos. There were times that you can feel sick. This is probably not a huge factor, but keep it in mind.","December 11, 2015","true","7.1"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","13","17","2","0"

Problem is, everyone else on the road is trying to kill you! Rednecks, cops, neo-nazis, furries, religious fanatics and other nutjobs - everyone wants you dead, so obviously you will put an end to that by killing them first.\n\nUpgrade your car and your arsenal, take lots of drugs, pick up friendly hitchhikers and leave a trail of destruction behind until you make it to that epic concert, or die trying - and you WILL die a lot, but will still come back for more, because at that point you'll be addicted already (and/or are a sucker for punishment).\n\nThe game has a kind of humor that manages to be immature while still being funny instead of obnoxious. The art style is a great blend of cartoony and gritty, which totally suits the mood of the game (as a fellow artist, I couldn't help but admire it and feel inspired).\n\nIn short, Death Skid Marks is addictive, kickass, fast-paced action, all to the sound of a badass metal soundtrack that will make you want to headbang. And I absolutely recommend it.","May 19, 2015","true","145.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

If any developers approaches me and says, "My game is a rogue-like-" I will interrupt their speech by just throwing money at them.  Many would say, "but what about the bad roguelikes?"  Honestly, I haven't found one yet.\n\nDeath Skid Marks continues to bolster my statement on the matter, only instead of wandering around in a dungeon this game puts you through what could quite easily be the road trip from/to hell.  Pick a car, start driving, kill people, pick up hitch-hikers, collect cash, and upgrade, upgrade, upgrade to what is supposed to be the most ♥♥♥♥♥ing concert ever (I wouldn't know, I still haven't gotten to it).  However looking past the rogue-like quality DSM posesses there is also a surprising necessity for twitch controls as your enemies spray bullet after bullet on you and your passengers while you're engaged in vehicular combat. To some degree there at times when it actually feels more like a bullet-hell shooter than arcade-esque roguelike.\n\nThe topping to this superb sundae of a game is a soundtrack that really gets blood pumping, and art style/humor that borders on funny yet possibly inappropriate.  In reality I literally said to myself while playing this game, "The only way this game could get any more awesome is if I could drive a damn tank."\n\nAnd then I magically started driving a tank by a method I won't even explain.

You cannot get past a certain point if you don't have certain upgrades and weapons and getting these upgrades is based on luck. Your crew will die very fast if their stats are too low. Your vehicle will be destroyed if its stats are too low. Getting higher stats  (usually) requires money (and there's never enough to get everything you need)  and having the upgrades spawn in the item shop. Of course, the item shop may never spawn the upgrades you need even if you get the money.  Also, you ALWAYS need the wrench and med kit, which can heal your vehicle and crew during the level. Of course healing uses cash and you have to buy both items, which may not spawn in the item shop for a while or at all.

It's the good kind of t*ts though! Death Skid Marks has got to be possibly the most engaging and unique Roguelites of it's kind. The game prides itself on it's "trashy humor" which I still get amused seeing the 50th time an Aryan Roadkiller car rolls up with the driver's name being something along the lines of, "Ryan Dickfingers." The art style also complements it's trashy nature with the old computer terminal overlay and the downright freaky characters you pick up off the side of the road. Not only style though, the game itself is amazing.\n\nEach game starts off slow. But the game progressively speeds up with each road segment and passing km. Handling one car at a time with up to a driver or a single passenger is fine. But having to deal with 3 cars filled with sniper rifle carrying neo-nazi's, flame thrower toting religious zealots and assault rifle and shotgun crazy rednecks is damn stressful. Wait, WHEN THE ♥♥♥♥ DID THAT ROBOT GET THERE?! This game is punishing if you don't manage your hitchhikers, car, money, and jobs properly, a single hitch hiker killed or one upgrade not purchased 2 roads back is enough to end your game IMMEDIATELY. Which is fine, because it keeps every game feeling fresh and having you learn your mistake and adapt correctly.\n\nThe only thing I can really say that's wrong with the game is that it's horribly unbalanced. Sure, melee does alot of damage, but late game you really can't afford to bring your hitch hikers anywhere near the other cars. Sure, I could take that dismemberment job for 50 dollars per person, but a 1/10 chance to actually earn that money doesn't make it worth it. Basically, All Ranged Weapons, Ranged Crew Kill jobs, and Wrench/Medkit strategy is the easy mode, and it works every time.\n\nOther than that, try this god damn game. It's a s**t-kicking, hamburger devouring, smash n' crash of a game that hopefully the two creators will update with a bit more content. (Right guys? New cars and hiker friends on the way guys? Right?!) Try it out.\n\nP.S:The soundtrack kicks ♥♥♥ is filled to the brim with all the 50 second punk/metal/ska? tunes you need. Whoever did the drums needs to be paid more.

There are elements from Spy Hunter and a slew of moto-bashing games, casually mixed-in with an easy-to-digest art style and funny, witty dialogue throughout. It's Mad Max meets Wayne's World, set to the pace of some of your favorites like Faster Than Light, with strategy being an absolute necessity from the beginning. Don't be surprised when you die. This will happen often at first. I haven't tried lowering the difficulty yet but given my near-disgust at losing time and time again, I'm sure I will at some point. Your measly winnings from each leve--nay, survival, barely pay for repairs and flapjacks to feed your carmates. And at some point, you're going to have to upgrade that shitheap you call a ride, so you're expected to deficate coin here and alot that appropriately. It's delicate.. juggling finances in such a chaotic environment. I mean, the entire point of the game is to reach some effing concert (I'm not even sure whose playing, let alone whether or not thay're any good). The music is fun and almost earthy at times. It can appeal to your metalhead or his hidden inner-hippie. Expect to see and hear nasty, truckstop-quality persons throughout the game. A few oddballs keep players on their toes and, of course, make the game that much more interesting. "Yes, I finished the game. How? With Mark Skids, an IT guy with no genuine benfit whatsoever other than filling a seat, a dude wearing a horse mask who ended up popping off more rounds than a crip in Compton, and a zombie, though he seems like the type who would take offense to your saying that." I wish that imaginary quote could include an ending, or some mention of the aforementioned concert. But alas, as I mentioned previously, I have yet to finish this ♥♥♥♥-all hard game.

If you like the look of this - get it. It IS what you think it is and it does it well.","November 23, 2014","true","1.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I've studied guides as well as learned alot from playing it.\n\nTo put it simply, I DO recommend this game, but it's no cakewalk & can be frustrating beyond what I expected from a roguelike. The difficulty of this game can be described as BRUTAL. I love roguelikes, but this one even on the normal difficulty will kick your ♥♥♥ all over the place.\n\nMy frustrations are with some of the bosses. If you get caught unprepared for a certain type of boss you will be SCREWED.\n\nI've tried all kinds of different strategies with many different vehicles and I still haven't gotten to the last 25% of the journey. I'm running out of patience but I know I'll keep playing. Many will argue and say "you're doing something wrong" and they're probably right, but with this much time spent in the game I feel like I should be improving. In the end, if it sucked I wouldn't have played it for this long. I cannot remember the last time I put this much time into a game. The art, music & overall atmosphere surrounding it are all fantastic.\n\nIf you're not a fan of permadeath this game will infuriate you, think about picking something else up. If you're a seasoned roguelike junkie you'll love Death Skid Marks, just be ready to have your ♥♥♥ handed to you and your face ground into hamburger against the pavement.","January 15, 2015","true","74.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drapocalypse/recommended/326150/","drapocalypse","Doctor ☢ Apocalypse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drapocalypse/","238 products in account","Wow, this game is something else. Its a mash up of some of our favorites. It has the top down driving combat of old-school Spy Hunter but taken to the hardcore bloody extreme where death seems to be part of the social norm. It also has the random rouge-like elements that feel similar to FTL, maybe toned down just a hair to favor a more arcadish experience. Toss in a small amount of stat building, nothing too annoying. This in a nutshell is a very TLDR of what DSM is similar to.\n\nThe game itself is a blast to play. Its bloody, over the top and offensive as hell. The splash art and character portraits scream of sweet awesome stylized characters influenced by death metal. It all fits the general theme well and is extremely well done. The game play can be a bit simple at first, but as the game progresses, so does the difficulty. You will die, a lot. Thats ok, its all part of the plan.\n\nThis game will chew you up at first. Once you get a few rounds in and get a chance to experience some of the bosses, its not as bad. Like FTL though, lady luck can ruin your day.  So for a measly 10 bucks, you to can experience the challenging, bloody and brutal, mad max inspired, arcade car beatem/shootem up that is Death Skid Marks. It is so worth your time and money.","November 27, 2014","true","43.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It is kind of a mashup of spyhunter, Carmageddon,  and any road trip movie. Mix in a heavy dose of Fear and Lothing in Las Vesgas with rude crude humor, and you have a recipe for a good time. Easy to grasp  controls mated with simple and intuitve menus quickly turn the family seadan the into a rolling mosh pit of death.\n\nPlenty of power ups to fuel the mayhem can be had at the many roadside stops, along with various hicthhikers to fill your car with violence  needed to get that  mega-metal concert at roads end. Purchace items from baseball bats to flame throwers to golden concet tickets to help you to arrive on time, in style, and mostly intact.\n\nDid I metion the humor? The game pokes fun at most everything, never has dying in a flaming car been so funny, and die you will lots. The roads many nutball factions are built to grind you to dust, and the bosses will just stop your butt into the pavement. There are no saves only continues, so there is no way to aviod your nasty  un-timely demise, but you can just start again and again, wich you will due to the addicing nature of the game.\n\nGame upsides\n\n1. Nice to look at art work with a full range of painful gory ways to die.\n\n2. Many ways to build up your crew with a large list of weapons and  drug to boost your stats. Dont forget the quickly boost stat over the barrel of a pistiol provided you survive the encounter.\n\n3. Lot of new buddies to share the road with you from all walks of life. Your gonna need them because the road is kinda rough and a new replacement freind is a good thing to have when bad things happen.\n\n4. Solid gameplay that take ten to thirty minutes to play. Do note I did not say complete.\n\nGame downsides.\n\n1. Not a game for whiny whimps who want lots of saves.\n\n2. Absoluty NOT for small kids to play language is harsh, and drug and booze abound.\n\n\nFor the money you will be forking over this game is a bargin with tons of replayabily go get it now.","November 29, 2014","true","31.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

In particular the sawblade groupie and the alien one. It feels like the car is always in harms way due to its size. Maybe they have really easy solutions that I haven't figured out yet, but it's always been a "game over" situation when going up against those two, even with a decently upgraded car and passangers.\n\nDespite that, the game is an utter blast. There's a real solid feel to all of the action and upgrading you can do and the unlockable cars add a really fun sense of replayability with each one requiring different tactics to use well. Saying that though, even the standard car can do the same.

No two games will play out the same. Multiple weapons, jobs, enemy types and hard-as-s.h.i.t bosses with permadeath to really make you plan your moves out. New crew members to recruit and can upgrade their stats with drugs or dropped off to a mad scientist for experimentation. New rides, drugs, weapons and modes to unlock as you take down bosses and if you manage to make it to the concert.\n\nYou will die often but the game is meant to be replayed over and over again so dust yourself off and hit the road again :)\n\nSurprising moment:\nPutting a crew member's life on the line via Russian Roulette to get 50% stat increase across ALL categories!! ;).\n\nHighlight:\nHad an alien riding shotgun while FIRING a shotgun at an enemy car.... sheer brilliance in the surreality of that scenario. ;)\n\nDidnt-see-that-coming moment:\nParody guest appearances by famous movie and cartoon characters like Scooby-doo and The Terminator!\n\nSad moment:\nLosing a crew that you have gotten attached to that rode with you until the bitter(and violent) end.

Winners Don't Do Drugs - Studio Whisky Tango Inc.\nMost Magnificent Review	DEATH SKID MARKS	Intro	Ah Death Skid Marks, so wrong, so fun, so good. This is why humanity is doomed so say I Lord Rexes.\n\nDeath Skid Marks is a vehicular slaughtering game in which religion, nazis, and every single dark side of humanity is left bare for all to see and shoot. Basically it is a topdown action vehicle slaughter roguelite game where you drive cars, shoot or whack other cars into explodium entertainment and using the money you get from amusing off-screen spectators to upgrade your car into more slaughter. Oh I love it. Let us dive in.	Presentation	Offensive, vulgar, and crass. Yet it all mixes well together in this pot of hedonism and greed where heavy metal music blares into your skull and every form of the worse humanity has to offer arrives to knock your skulls into your that puny brain of yours.\n\nVisceral and bloody. This is the game that took the theme of rock, senseless violence, hitler, and redneck to the extreme and ran with it all the way to the finish line.	Does it run well? Controls? Or perhaps the option menu?	Yes, yes, and no.\n\nIt runs like a charming dream at a constant 60 fps despite the huge amount of destruction and carnage on-screen.\n\nControls are so good even a T-Rex such as I could maneuver myself deftly enough to deliver a killing blow to the schumck beside me. Assuming you are using the keyboard that is because its hard to aim using the two noobly things on the controller.\n\nUnfortunately options menu are rather bare where the most minimum options are present but it already runs well in the first place so it is not as bad as you think it is.	Graphics!	Does it look realistic? No it does not but it does look silly. And despite the look you will be surprise at the amount of detail that little death on wheel you call a car can have. Burn it and scorch mark from hells will appear and smack it until it shows its terrible soft hide at below.\n\nEverything from the menu till the character art looks great but more variation for the stores would not hurt.	The Sound	I am a cold blooded animal and what better way to get this veins flowing than to jam along to the rock music this game is packed to the brim with. Smash your enemies skulls with an array of excellently done tracks. 	Gameplay	It has come to this has it not?\nPick a difficulty, pick a car. Then start smashing/shooting/ramming your way to vahalla.\n\nThe objective of game is to reach the end of the road which happens to be a concert, preferably with the head of everyone still intact. To aid you with that you have an array of vehicle to choose from at start although it does lock you in once the actual game starts. Things like armor, amount of passenger, and strange passive are up for consideration.\n\nHaving done that you now pick up people along the way to take up space in your meatlocker so they can shoot/smash or act as a general meatshield. A legitimate strategy trust me. Each crew also has their own specialty so mix and match those bodies.\n\nYou choose a path to take at the end of every encounter with symbols telling you the remaining distance, enemy types, and special event on display. You earn money by completing job while on the road then you use these money to buy tickets, weapons, armor, health, and other typical things.\n\nThen it is back on the road killing things until you die and restart over or reach the end and savor the delicious ending [and unlockable new vehicles by bringing people [alive] to the concert!]\nAlong the way enemies from all shapes and sizes will try to stop your holy pilgrimage.\n\nThe longer you survive, the better the reward, weapons, and enemies you will be force to duel with.	Thoughts and Conclusion 	Well it certainly takes the theme and turn it all the way up and unlike some games it does it well, enjoyable, and fun.\n\nI would give this game a solid recommendation so long as you know that you will be facing a lot of restart, a lot of trial and a solid roguelite combat.	Nom!	Check out these delicio- I mean great reviewer besides myself in our humble little group.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/326150/\n\nIf I may, get the OST and jam out to some seriously wicked tunes.","January 1","true","12.1"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

I wish there was a neutral review.  Don't get me wrong, the game is fun, but eventually you start feeling like you're beating your head against a brick wall.  The normal enemies are easy.  Almost too easy, but the music, artwork, and writing all blend together very well.  The problem comes when you encounter some of the bosses.  In every case the normal mechanics you're used to change in some way and it's very possible to find yourself in a situation where it's impossible to defeat the boss you're facing with your current crew and gear.  Some bosses are stupidly easy.  Some are impossibly hard (in my opinion).  Why it starts to feel like banging your head against a wall is because very little can carry over between playthroughs.  You can unlock new vehicles to try and you can build up a death counter which you can spend on a perk for your next playthrough, but then the perk and its associated cost from the death counter are gone.  If you have a hard time with a set of bosses you can't rely on playing the game to build up stats in game over multiple play throughs to eventually get past the boss.  You have to improve your own player skill.  It's the only way.  I kind of like that in the sense it's the classic arcade styling, but it's also kind of annoying because it gates the end content to some extent.  Some people will just never be able to get past certain bosses (which are randomly selected each playthrough).  I've only managed 3/4 the way to the concert so far myself.\n\nIs it fun?  For a while.  Some players will start to find it frustrating.  Do I recommend it?  If it's on sale, definitely.  If it's not on sale...  think about what you're looking for in a game before you buy.","February 21, 2015","true","3.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

All I can say is that it was the right choice in adding "Death Skid Mark" to my list of games. The game is very enjoyable to play even if its just a "car game" as some might see it as BUT its more than that. Everything has to be upgraded from the cars condition, cars performance, characters heath, characters stats and choice of weapons. So its not just another drive from point a to point b without thinking cause if you do then you won't make it to far. As some reviewers said before - it takes a certain skill and a chance of luck to beat this game. It is also unforgivably hard to some players but if you stick to it you might just beat it in medium mode and continue to the other 13 Super ultra hard modes (I know I haven't yet).\n\nI suggest giving the game a shot & since its on sale its a steal to grab for your collection. I got the soundtrack bundle which was great for the price.\n\n\nI forgot to mention that this game has a lot of Cameo characters that you come across and destroy.

Every single run drags on for way too long for this style of game, and the vast majority of them will end with you being screwed over by some asinine overpowered combination of weapons on some regular enemy, or the one boss you didn't get good enough ranged/melee for.  Most of the game's problems stem from the extremely unenjoyable "rng" shop system with not only its arbitrary spawning system (the fact that you get a shop almost every single wave early on in the game when you literally do not need them and can't make enough money to even use them, then can't get a single one for half a dozen waves when you're far enough to actually be taking damage), but the similarly arbitrary selection of things that are actually available to buy in any given shop.\n\nThis system in tandem with the distasteful pricing balancing of weapons/items/upgrades just drains any enjoyment from a run you play well, and makes ones in which you don't even more frustrating. To add on to the frustration, the only persistent mechanic in place is spending your kills, usually in amounts that take an hour or longer to accrue, on a trivial one-run stat boost. The reason so many games these days implement some kind of over-arching progression mechanic is so that you don't automatically feel like you just completely wasted your time when you get blindsided after half an hour by exactly the kind of cheap trick deaths this game is filled to the brim with.\n\nUltimately, the game is not terrible, but I can't recommend it to anyone that I would know. If the runs took 10-15 minutes to reach the deaths that almost always feel rigged against you, then it wouldn't be so bad, but the dragging nature and the frustrating mechanics just make it a bad experience overall.","July 28, 2015","false","10.1"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","4"

It has a bit progression, so that when you meet certain condition, it will unlock more cars.\n\nAfter almost ten hours I can say that I wish I could like this game more, but I don't.\nMy problem with it and the reason why I don't reccomend it, is that you lose really fast. Depending on the enemy or your car, you can go from 100% to 0% in a matter of seconds.\n\nGetting back from the start is not a big penalty, luckly, but the punishment is too harsh, and quite often too fast to understand what you're doing wrong. Even following the users' guides doesn't help you much, and you're left with the frustration of not getting why you failed.\n\nMany people compare this game to FTL, but it's not right. In that game, with care, you may come back from the ground, plan around problems, min max your games. Here the gameplay is more flat, immediate, and with little room for mistakes.\n\nA missed opportunity for a really good game.","January 19","false","10.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

You will die alot. You will not complete it without a lot of time investment as there is a lot to learn and you will need to train your skills. You will be overwhelmed by the amount of upgrades and equipment that you can spend your limited death dollars on. As mentioned earlier the only way to overcome this is to experiment and die. Lots. And then some more. I still stick by my comment regarding the guns in the game, they seem weak compared to other options. Maybe I'm just impatient.\n\nIt is however a very good game and extremely addictive. The music is fairly good too.\n\nAfter reconsideration, I believe this game deserves an 8/10, among it's peers.\n\n\n"Seriously I almost didn't recommend this game....\n\nEverything about it is great, except the difficutly is just off the scale; even for a roguelike; even on the 2nd lowest setting. Don't get me wrong, I like hard games but this just takes this biscuit. It needs retuning for sure.\n\nIf i can't work out how to kill a boss (the same boss ( the saw boss)) in 3.3 hours played, without resorting to watching a tactic on youtube (this isn't WoW ffs) then something is wrong. I'm sure I could learn some really more important stuff in that time.\n\nAlso the guns in this game need to do double the damage they currently do; melee weapons and ramming are just so much easier.\n\nGreat concept, fantastic style, will probably play it again and again. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone without a heap of patience. A big fat average 6/10."","June 5, 2015","true","60.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's one of those games you need to play first to find out if you'll like it or not, and the gameplay does get a bit stale relatively quickly, but it's worth at least a few playthroughs.

You're Mark Skid and your goal is to get to a concert. On your way you'll pick up hitchhikers, gear them up with weapons, upgrade your car and kill absolutely everything and everyone that gets in your way.\n\nYou can unlock a lot of different cars, each being different then the other. Some give passive bonuses/penalties, some are equipped with saws or even with a freaking rocket launcher.\n\nYou can equip your hitchhikers with melee or ranged weapons that you can buy in shops. In those shops you can also buy food to heal your characters, upgrades to your car, drugs to boost stats of your characters, repair your vehicle, all kinds of special items and of course tickets to the concert!\n\nThere are also all kind of mini-games that you can enter during your trip. There's a russian roulette mini-game where if your selected character loses he dies but if he wins his stats get boosted greatly. There's also a slot machine if you feel like gambling, workshop where you can upgrade your weapons and other stuff.\n\nThere's a decent number of bosses that you can encounter and they get randomly selected for each run. In each run you will face a total of 5 bosses, including the final one but they'll always be different (even final bosses change each time). They all of course have their own attacks and patterns that you'll have to learn if you want to beat them.\n\nThe game is pretty challenging but fun and addictive. The RNG can help or screw you over at times like in any game from this genre and I have to admit that when I started playing I thought it's unfair and impossible to win. But as I continued to play I realized that's not the case. Once you get skilled enough at the game and know how everything works you can win.","June 25, 2015","true","74.8"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

You pick a vehicle and some people with different strengths/weaknesses, and have to get from point A to point B while upgrading everything, buying weapons, and trying not to turn into roadkill thanks to the endles hordes of rednecks, white surpremicists, cartoon mascots, aliens, and other freaks trying to end your road tirp before it even begins. It's brutally difficult but also tons of fun, and it's pretty funny to boot.\n\nLike FTL the RNG is not your friend.

It's hard and can get even harder for people who like it that way.\nIt has a voiced tutorial, so that way you don't run into the brick wall face first and end up dying right off the bat, because the game will do that for you anyway.\nIt has fun, wacky characters that you can add to your team of roadies and a hilarious number of enemies based off appropriate car jokes and all-around hilarity.\nI appreciate it for the close-to Rat Fink art style and the fact that the character portaits reflect their overall health. I appreciate this game, for being a wacky top-down car game where you can kill everything, and are encouraged to do so. I like the challenge modifiers that play a crucial role in actually improving.\nI like the music, for the most part. After the first few hours though, it can get a little obnoxious but you can turn it off.\n\nI will now give a Review thing and then Cons:\n\nGraphics: Unique. It's a different style of artwork that brings back memories of old car magazines and wacky cars of all sorts. It looks good and has no real problems. More than satisfactory\n\nDifficulty: Challenging. It has a number of modes, modifiers and ways to play and the additional in-game modifiers that alter your play style basically gives it a huge number of ways to play from up close to ranged to hit and run. Additionally, since you have to actually get people to the concert to get their ending parts, there is an actual concrete goal you can see ticking down as you get closer and closer.\n\nGameplay: It's a Rat Fink Style Wacky Racers Deathmatch where anything goes. Your crew will die, your car will die and you will laugh and bite your tongue, desperate to prove you can beat it. It's also good for a quick 15 minutes of fun. You can pick it up, put it down and it will be just as fun as you remember.\n\nCurrent Cons or Bugs? Nothing I have really noticed. Everything seems well made but if I find one, I'll make sure to say so.\n\nOverall Opinion: Death Skid Marks is a game that you can give you a lot of entertainment for challenge and for how little it costs. It looks good. It sounds good. It plays well. I wish I had something to say that was negative about it, but really there isn't. Unless you count it being hard, but that is entirely based on your skill level. It's not so easy that you'll just breeze through it, but not so hard that you can't see the point. It's like, how I think it should feel, like an old arcade game.\nHowever I do have one word of warning to people: If you die, you have to start All the way over. It is rogue-ish in that fashion. And while I feel it would be appropriate for you to be able to respawn at your last pitstop, or even have lives (hey I found my one complaint) I do feel it is a bit too unforgiving.\n\nTips and Tricks:\nWhen playing if you find the mad doctor, use the cancer guy. I have had him healed and maxed 3 times in a ride and if he's fully healed and upgraded, he is a nice shade of pink.\nDon't trust ??? it leads to a mad gamble machine that essentially gives you a random trade that can and likely will ruin your games.\nRemember, your character stats do matter and the positioning does also. If you can't ram the side with a guy that has a buzzsaw, get on the other side. Use other cars on the road to your advantage.\nI think the Alien increases difficulty or something, because randomly the game seems to get harder when you have him, and considering he has +'s in all areas, I could see the developers adding this trick.\nAlways get the food you can get when you need it. That last pitstop might be your Last.\nAlways get the Nerd Weapons even if it puts you down 1 active weapon, they are insanely good and can turn the tide of even the hardest boss fight.\nLast Tip? Go Slow. If you go for a longer path you will, for a fact, face less bosses on the road. Additionally you'll earn more cash, so hey, win-win.","April 19, 2015","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very simple: you ram, swing, or shoot at the enemy car and either kill the passengers or blow the car up.\n\nDifferent crew members have various strength and weaknesses.  Shops will have a semi-random mix of items and upgrades.  You can play the game a bit differently with each run.

It's easy to start up and get into, it has a ton of different modes and unique cars, and combining roguelike elements with car combat is definitely inspired.\n\nHowever, I consistently run into the same problem that ultimately chased me away from FTL. With a little luck, some careful maneuvering, and decent resource allocation I can get about 75% through a run before hitting a brick wall. Sometimes I'll get worn down in a way that feels organic, like my death was the result of mistakes I was making. But more often then not, I run into a ridiculous combination of enemies and environmental challenges that no amount of skill or preparation could defeat.\n\nFor example, I was just driving a tank and laying waste to everything. The very first boss I encountered (The Buzzsaw Alien) destroyed my tank in literally less than 5 seconds. In almost 40 hours of playing, I've managed to beat this boss twice (maybe). Usually, whenever it shows up, I just kind of resign myself to death. I still have no idea what its patterns are, or when the "shield is down." Also, the boss is surrounded by a giant saw that is always rotating. Sometimes the saw actually damages your car, which is usually enough to kill you almost instantly. Sometimes it doesn't damage you at all. I have no idea when it does or doesn't cause damage.\n\nWhen it comes to roguelikes, it's always difficult to determine whether constant death is the player's fault, or the developer trying to escalate the difficulty and going a little too hard in the paint. The general response to complaints about the game's difficulty have been of the "Git Gud" variety, so I'm not holding my breath about any future patches balancing the late-game a little more in the player's favor. However, for the sake of this game (which IS good and worth the effort), I hope I'm wrong.","May 27, 2015","true","39.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They have to learn that some bosses are ♥♥♥♥♥♥, RNG can suck and hoarding money is almost never a good idea among other things.\n\nIn discussions for this game, people seem to rage a lot about how unfair it is and, I admit, I partly agree. It WAS unfair at first. I had no idea what strategies to use or why some bosses destroyed me so easily.\nBut, once you comprehend the game's key rules, it actually is a very fun game. Your first win is a great feeling, and I find the game more rewarding than many other rogue-likes out there, even Binding of Isaac: Rebirth.\n\nSo, yes, I recommend this game, but I do warn people to understand it's a real pain at first (I'm talking around 1-3 hours gameplay). If you're like me and enjoy the style of the game enough to keep playing and 'get good', you'll really enjoy it.

The gameplay is quite similar to the one in games like Spy Hunter or Death Rally, only much faster: your best attempt may end in the matter of seconds if you are not careful enough. Every decision you make, except choosing your starting difficulty and vehicle, is governed by the random number generator. Finding the right combination of hikers, giving them jobs, weapons, drugs and items, upgrading the vehicle, knowing when to actually buy all of these things and when to save money, choosing the right turn on the road... all of these decisions help in facing the randomness of Death Skid Marks.

The formula really works well. It's complex enough to be interesting, simple enough to be able to learn in 30 minutes, and has enough randomness and unlockables to keep it stimulating.\n","October 5, 2015","true","18.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Did you ever think to yourself: "This game is pretty good and all, but the pause button needs to go, also it's too easy, and not nearly metal enough."? Then this is the game for you!\n\nDeath Skid Marks plays like Spy Hunter meets Mad Max meets FTL. You pick a vehicle and some people with different strengths/weaknesses, and have to get from point A to point B while upgrading everything, buying weapons, and trying not to turn into roadkill thanks to the endles hordes of rednecks, white surpremicists, cartoon mascots, aliens, and other freaks trying to end your road tirp before it even begins. It's brutally difficult but also tons of fun, and it's pretty funny to boot.\n\nLike FTL the RNG is not your friend. Also like FTL, proper play and clever strategies can mitigate bad luck...at least to an extent.\n\nIt's good, it's cheap, it offers replay value out the ♥♥♥, buy it.","July 25, 2015","true","26.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's hard and can get even harder for people who like it that way.\nIt has a voiced tutorial, so that way you don't run into the brick wall face first and end up dying right off the bat, because the game will do that for you anyway.\nIt has fun, wacky characters that you can add to your team of roadies and a hilarious number of enemies based off appropriate car jokes and all-around hilarity.\nI appreciate it for the close-to Rat Fink art style and the fact that the character portaits reflect their overall health. I appreciate this game, for being a wacky top-down car game where you can kill everything, and are encouraged to do so. I like the challenge modifiers that play a crucial role in actually improving.\nI like the music, for the most part. After the first few hours though, it can get a little obnoxious but you can turn it off.\n\nI will now give a Review thing and then Cons:\n\nGraphics: Unique. It's a different style of artwork that brings back memories of old car magazines and wacky cars of all sorts. It looks good and has no real problems. More than satisfactory\n\nDifficulty: Challenging. It has a number of modes, modifiers and ways to play and the additional in-game modifiers that alter your play style basically gives it a huge number of ways to play from up close to ranged to hit and run. Additionally, since you have to actually get people to the concert to get their ending parts, there is an actual concrete goal you can see ticking down as you get closer and closer.\n\nGameplay: It's a Rat Fink Style Wacky Racers Deathmatch where anything goes. Your crew will die, your car will die and you will laugh and bite your tongue, desperate to prove you can beat it. It's also good for a quick 15 minutes of fun. You can pick it up, put it down and it will be just as fun as you remember.\n\nCurrent Cons or Bugs? Nothing I have really noticed. Everything seems well made but if I find one, I'll make sure to say so.\n\nOverall Opinion: Death Skid Marks is a game that you can give you a lot of entertainment for challenge and for how little it costs. It looks good. It sounds good. It plays well. I wish I had something to say that was negative about it, but really there isn't. Unless you count it being hard, but that is entirely based on your skill level. It's not so easy that you'll just breeze through it, but not so hard that you can't see the point. It's like, how I think it should feel, like an old arcade game.\nHowever I do have one word of warning to people: If you die, you have to start All the way over. It is rogue-ish in that fashion. And while I feel it would be appropriate for you to be able to respawn at your last pitstop, or even have lives (hey I found my one complaint) I do feel it is a bit too unforgiving.\n\nTips and Tricks:\nWhen playing if you find the mad doctor, use the cancer guy. I have had him healed and maxed 3 times in a ride and if he's fully healed and upgraded, he is a nice shade of pink.\nDon't trust ??? it leads to a mad gamble machine that essentially gives you a random trade that can and likely will ruin your games.\nRemember, your character stats do matter and the positioning does also. If you can't ram the side with a guy that has a buzzsaw, get on the other side. Use other cars on the road to your advantage.\nI think the Alien increases difficulty or something, because randomly the game seems to get harder when you have him, and considering he has +'s in all areas, I could see the developers adding this trick.\nAlways get the food you can get when you need it. That last pitstop might be your Last.\nAlways get the Nerd Weapons even if it puts you down 1 active weapon, they are insanely good and can turn the tide of even the hardest boss fight.\nLast Tip? Go Slow. If you go for a longer path you will, for a fact, face less bosses on the road.

Shops will have a semi-random mix of items and upgrades.  You can play the game a bit differently with each run.
