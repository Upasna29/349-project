Yes, Phil Fish was quite nasty after making this game, but the game itself I believe is true art.\n\nWhat I love about this game is its non-linear gameplay style. At the beginning, you explore your village, find a hat that gives you powers, and then it tells you, "There are 64 things to collect. Go find them." At first, I hated this. "You want me to collect 64 collectibles without any sense of direction? This game sucks." But then, I realized the game's true beauty. Exploration. You go into a door, you don't know what will be behind it. It could be one of the 64 collectibles, a puzzle, a chest, a secret, anything is possible. And that, is why I recommend FEZ to anyone who loved games like Zelda: Windwaker, people who love to explore.","December 23, 2014","true","2.4"," 129 of 165 people (78%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","78","129","165","7","1"

This game is incredible for it's price. Heck, even if this game was 2-dimensional it would still be a great puzzler! But one of the most unique and certainly enjoyable aspects of this game is the ability to rotate the entire world to explore new areas. Here are some of the finest points of the game.\n\nInnovative Ideas Take your favorite Mario Bros. game and compare it to FEZ. Where regular platformers, such as Mario Bros., have only the basic 2-D sidescrolling capability, FEZ has a fully rotatable world, where turning the world opens up new objects to jump on, new cubes to collet (see below), and new rooms to visit. It's as if the developers said "I'll call your two dimensions, and I'll raise you a third dimension!" In all seriousness though, this is by far the most compelling part of FEZ. It is what truly makes it stand out as a platformer.\n\nFEZ consists of linear gameplay, but the way that the "doors between worlds" are presented to the player make it seem like you have endless choices to make. There is no time limit to the game, and taking full advantage of this situation, I found myself constantly fully exploring the worlds before moving on to the next. The originality of FEZ is an easy 10 on my list.\n\nObjective  FEZ is centered around the objective of collecting cubes to unlock new worlds. There are 32 cubes to collect, with each cube having a number of pieces to find in each world. To unlock the second world, you have to collect two cubes. To unlock the third world, you need 4 cubes (including the previous 2). For the fourth world, you need 8 cubes (including the previous 4 cubes). It's a really nice progression system that is well timed and not overbearingly, excruciatingly long and difficult.\n\nAddictiveness  One of the things that I personally liked about this game is that it really isn't very addicting. You won't feel like playing it every time you open Steam, but I can assure you that there are plenty of times that you will be compelled to buy it. While this might be a con for some players, I found myself playing the game less frequently but for longer periods of time, which gave me a better experience when playing. I would not go so far as to call the game addictive, but it surely isn't boring in any sense of the word.\n\nControls and Graphics The game has simple pixel graphics, but the colors are really vivid in this game. The developers chose really bright color schemes and not dull/dark colors, which I have seen ruin games before. The only thing here is that when you rotate the world, there are no shadows so it is often difficult to tell which direction you have to turn.\nAs for controls, the default controls spread all the way from left ctrl to the arrow keys. For me, this is a big time no-go (the only exception being The Binding of Isaac). When FEZ adds an option to change the controls to at lease wasd/ijkl, the controls system will inprove considerably.\n\nValue Having gotten FEZ as part of the Steam Summer Sale, it was just one of many games I picked up over the course of the week-and-a-half event. However, as soon as I played it, I realized the amazing deal that I had gotten. In fact, I even mentioned to some friends to go and give it a try. For the 2 bucks that I got it for, FEZ is simply amazing. At full price, if you're into puzzlers and platformers, buy it. If not, still buy it. Trust me, it's a great game and the price is right.\n\nAspect        Rating                Originality        10                Addictiveness        6                Graphics        8                Value        10                Overall        9\nFinal Points on the Game Not only is FEZ a great platformer, the rotating world concept also makes it one of the most unique games in it's class. This is a must-buy!\n\nBe sure to check out any of my other reviews on my profile, and please upvote if this helped you, I hope it did!

The unique spin world mechanic platform puzzles are fun and finding the hidden cubes is addicting. Such a shame the game couldn't have be expanded on that basic premise rather than shoehorning in a load of pretentious over complicated code breaking puzzles that will leave you scratching your head, and ultimately seeking help online.\nI feel like I wasted my time.","December 21, 2013","false","17.8"," 153 of 214 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","153","214","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OneHandedSquire/recommended/224760/","OneHandedSquire","OneHandedSquire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OneHandedSquire/","168 products in account","I really liked 2001: A Cube Odyssey.  Okay, it's called Fez, but like Kubrick's epic, I'm going to recommend this game and tell you that it's challenging and artistic and generally great.  I'm also going to tell you what a piece of ♥♥♥♥ it can be and why some might be turned off by it (again, like 2001).\n\nFez carries a similar theme of striving to engage with things beyond our understanding.  It also mirrors neatly the invetervention of a vast alien intelligence in the affairs of a primitive people,   And, before you ask: yes, things get trippy and a bit pretentious toward the end and, yes, no matter how firm our grasp on the physics of things Fez will always have inexplicable bits beyond the ken of our primitive monkey brains.\n\nOur vast alien intelligence du jour is a cube.  Yup, that's right, a cube: one of the platonic solids, a d6, one of the basic units of Lego, those dang boxes you'll be pushing in almost every video game ever.  But, hey, you're a cool 2D dude living in a 2D world so it totally blows your mind, man.  Also, it gives you the ability to rotate the world around its axis, showing you hidden sides of things and allowing you to rerrange the environment along your 2D perspective to solve puzzles.  And, if I haven't tortured the 2001/Fez comparison enough, quite a few of those puzzles will make you feel like a baboon impotently smashing a bone against a futuristic space monolith.\n\nFez delivers all of this through retro-style pixel graphics hung over a 3D frame.  Everything is colorful and appealing and each environment is vast, but carries its own distinct tone and character that keeps exploration exciting.  It's just a visually charming game.  Well, there were one or two bits with harsh flashing and garbage that made my eyeballs want to jump out and commit seppuku for the harm they were doing to my head, but mostly visually charming.  Yeah, sticking with that.\n\nYour goal in Fez iso to collect cubes and cube fragments through platforming and solving puzzles.  While platforming you rearrange the world to create a path for you to climb and jump up to get collectibles and reach new areas.  Falling to your doom just places you back at the ledge you fell from and there are few other hazards.  It's casual in the sense that there is no combat, but there are a few sections where the timing and precision required are viscious.  Most of these are only for 100% completion; not necessary for the basic ending.\n\nThe platforming challenges will test your logic, but won't tax you to your limits.  As for the "puzzle" puzzles, well, that is your hardcore experience, mister gamer man.  Some of the puzzles will require you to observe and relate hints from locations spanning the game's massive map.  Areas you might not have been to in hours.  It will test your cryptography skills and even your ability to think outside the game.  Some of these are quite clever, but many of them will be those sorts of puzzles where you either get them quickly or you never will.  I think where the game missteps badly are its small number of puzzles that ask you to use resources beyond the scope of the game.  While almost anybody playing Fez will have internet access and the power to decipher a QR code, for instance, some people will likely stumble on what they require to do so, and, more isidiously, puzzles like that tell the player that not all the puzzles in the game are self contained.  Since you've been quite clearly told you need outside knowledge for a minority of the puzzles, you might go looking outside the game for answers when a little more patience and exploration could do the job.\n\nNow, my stupid self will shout those puzzles down as being "unfair" and then take them behind the shed, while you might be some enlightened space being who finds ciphers based on that bit about the fox and the dog and the English language quite dull.  Either way, none of the worst puzzles are needed just to get the normal end.\n\nThere are also three puzzles based on obscure moon logic that I'm pretty sure only specialists and/or the combined force of the internet were meant to solve.  Solving these does basically nothing and doesn't detract from the game, though they are included side-by-side with the games other puzzles with no ceremony whatsoever.  What I'm saying here is: to enjoy Fez, you've got to pick your puzzles, be okay with walking away, and try to be patient for a little while before you spoil them for yourself.  That's how you'll get the most fun out of the game.\n\nAnd it is a fun game!  A really fun game, even!  So pick it up and get ready to rotate your brain!\n\nP.S. If you're on the fence about getting Fez because you've heard that Phil Fish is a righteous ♥♥♥♥, my advice is just to get it.  From what I've read, Phil seems like a guy who just doesn't handle people well and could maybe use some anger management, rather than somebody with genuinely bad intentions.  Ultimately, I don't know the guy well enough to make that judgement and I don't think the media has given a broad enough perspective on him for anybody who doesn't know him personally to make that judgement.  What I do know is that Fez is the result of several people's hard work and is a cheerful, inclusive, brilliant experience.  It's worth a few bucks on its merit alone and anybody who created it can't be all bad.\n\n","February 8, 2015","true","16.6"," 54 of 63 people (86%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","86","54","63","9","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaleMan/recommended/224760/","MaleMan","Male Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaleMan/","444 products in account","Self indulgent and underrealized.\n\nFez is dominated by a main puzzle mechanic that is never used to any real effect, frustrating platforming physics, almost no variation in mechanics, and "decode the background" puzzles. In addition, it makes frequent use of artless metagame effects (e.g. fake crashes) that are clearly supposed to affect the player but in reality the only emotion they evoke is impatience.\n\nThe central gimmick of the game is that you interact with a 2D plane, but the world is 3D and can be rotated. By switching the world around, you can change the apparent location of objects and move between them even if they're at wildly different depths. Nearly every actual use of this mechanic will be fully explored by the time you finish the tutorial. Nearly all the rest of the game makes use of the same two or three tricks.\n\nWorld locations have their own additional mechanic layered on top of the basic platforming, but none are more complex than basic key/door puzzles. You might have to carry a block to a switch, carry a bomb to a cracked wall, or raise a platform into position, but never will you have to engage in any real thought or foresight about your actions.\n\nFurther frustrating the samey gameplay are the core platforming actions you'll be engaging in for the entire game. Your character is slow and heavy. Changing direction is a chore and it takes ages to traverse platforms. The climbing and mantling animations are even slower, giving you plenty of time to reflect on exactly how long it takes for your inputs to be realized into actual events.\n\nAnd then there are the optional anticube puzzles. And thank God they're optional. I found two that required me to scan a QR code. I do not own a smart phone. Another needed me to feel the vibrations in my controller and copy the left/right pattern as world rotations. I can't imagine what I would've done if weren't using an Xbox controller. Probably give up and go somewhere else. Plenty of other apparent puzzles had no immediate means of interaction, and on my save they are still unsolved. I have little desire to go back and try them again.\n\nAs a fan of indie games, I hate Fez for being everything people think of when they say "Ugh, indie games." Thanks for living up to the stereotype, Phil Fish.","December 15, 2013","false","4.3"," 282 of 425 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","282","425","0","5"

There's no game over, which is an interesting design choice I can get behind of, but those black holes are annoying obstacles that add nothing to the game but frustration. It is utterly enigmatic if you're planning on playing to completion, and the fact you have to get out of the game or rely on other devices to solve some of the mysteries (like those QR codes kind of thing) was a major turn off. I was led to believe this was a peaceful platformer focused on puzzle-solving, but the game can be quite unforgiving sometimes. It forces you to pay attention, and the untidy layout of the rooms leave you with a plethora of clues to be tried on a plethora of rooms, and you'll never know what refers to what until you accidentally get one of your hunches right.\n\nThe map is huge, which, in a way, is a positive thing, but traveling through it is confusing and annoying, given the fact you can't just fast travel to a certain room; you have to make your way over there through all the other rooms... This can be frustrating since the map is quite confusing -- it looks great and unique, but you never know which door leads where unless you try one by one. There are so many doors and rooms it is easy to forget which door leads where even after you been through it several times.\n\nIt's an incredible game, but the overall experience I had with it was very frustrating and that it was, ultimately a waste of my time. More than once I felt like breaking the controller in my own head, so infuriated I was. I feel this game caters to a very specific audience, so if you're not in for a challenge (or spending a lot of time and effort into it), you'd better off with some other game. I usually try to get all achievements in games, but this one felt like too much work, and I didn't want to rely on a guide; what's the point of playing a game if you're going to replicate the steps described in a guide? If you play games to relax at the end of a long day, I don't reccommend it. Teenagers and core gamers would find this more appealing.\n\nIf you're not an achievement collector, the first playthrough is interesting and free of difficult challenges, but you won't be able to visit several rooms, some of which are only available after finishing the game once. A great part of the game will remain undiscovered, which shortens the play time and affects willingness to invest on its full price, after all, if you're only going to visit half of the rooms, what's the point of paying for the full experience?\n\nI don't ask for hand-holding, but it feels to me like it lacks serious consistency, leaving the gimmick as the only redeeming factor about it.","May 22, 2014","false","19.1"," 244 of 377 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","244","377","0","5"

I agree that this game is nearly perfect. It's fun to play. The controls are okay. The music is cool. The art is brilliant. And there are good designed puzzles. And the best part is it's difficulty: in this game you need to collect 32 normal cubes and 32 anti-cubes, among other things. The normal cubes are easy to find, and to beat the game you only need 32 cubes. So, if you're not very good with puzzle games, you can beat this game. Since it has (almost) an open world style, if you get stuck you can just keep moving ahead, instead of being stuck forever. The anti-cubes are harder, but some are easier to get than others. But getting them all is a real challenge. And there are also 3 red cubes, which are extremely hard to find. So, this is a game for everyone. I think it has the right lenght, but it can be annoying sometimes, for example when you need to backtrack.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MIB2/recommended/224760/","MIB2","=(eGO)=™ MIB2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MIB2/","838 products in account","FEZ was overhyped.\n\nThere is no denying that. When I first started playing it, I was let down. The world-turning mechanics were boring, the platforming unresponsive, at least to my tastes, the art style didn't suit me. I wondered, what was it that people loved so much about FEZ. I hated the game so much that I dropped it almost immediately.\n\nFast-forward to yesterday, to the day that everything changed. I forced myself to play just a bit more in order to at least beat it. I thought I was returning to the land of tedium, and yet this wasn't the case. Maybe it was the anti-hype quarantine period that helped. I discovered that this game was not what it seems. Instead of platforming, I found increasingly challenging puzzles. It was filled with cryptic messages, lingustic riddles, hidden ciphres. It was fascinating.\n\nThis game does nothing to help you discover it's true beauty. It's radiance comes from the fact that it holds you to extremely high standards. What other game forces you to decrypt a language using a Rosetta stone like device? Pen and paper are a must here.\n\nThink of a brutally hard, unforgiving game. Be it Super Hexagon, Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy, I'm sure you remember the extreme sense of accomplishment that surged through you when you conquered it's many challenges. FEZ is like that, only instead of your reflexes, it challenges your mind. Do yourself a favor and play it. Do yourself another favor, and never use guides. You will love it.

I feel a bit guilty about that.\n\nThis is a platform puzzle game with a bit of a twist. Your character, a little white creature called Gomez, lives a happy, if not limited life, in a flat 2D world. Then something happens, and he's granted the ability to see the world from new perspectives. The world is actually a 3D world, and Gomez can flip the perspective around. Paper Mario comes to mind here. But it doesn't stop there. Not only is there puzzles that require you to change perspective in clever ways, but there are codes and clues to solve. This is a game that calls for a pen and some paper. Some of these puzzles are so hard to figure out that you just may have to cheat by checking the internet.\n\nWhile the puzzles themselves makes the game interesting, it's the atmosphere that draws you in. Right off the bat I was absolutely charmed by the game. The funny character Gomez, the living world around him and that sense of mystery and curiosity. The visuals are just so well done. It really does seem to live, down to small animals jumping around and playing in the grass. And, the music. Ah, it's just a wonderful match. At times I've found myself lingering just to listen to that music and feel the tranquility, and a couple of times it sent chills down my spine.\n\nTake heed, fellow gamer. This might look like a common retro game, but you are mistaken. True, the graphics are a tribute to gaming past, and there are some hints at inspirations from games like The Legend of Zelda. But, this is something completely original, and it's so well thought-out and sown together. It is simply a masterpiece. This is art!\n\nNeedless to say, I can warmly recommend this game.

But a bait and switch only works on a player when the result is something better, something innovative, something enjoyable. If you don't meet those expectations, the player will feel lied to.\n\nFez, sadly, isn't clever enough to pull it off. The switch doesn't make the game better, it merely reveals its unfortunate true nature.\n\nFez does not become a novel or even interesting game once the switch happens. It becomes a 2012 spiritual sequel to Castlevania II, aided purely by the existence of the internet to allow players to navigate through the same poorly telegraphed logic. That experience wasn't fun to play in 1988 and, while its confusing nature has become easier to circumvent, I lack the patience to slog through that same experience 24 years later, even if it has more vibrant visuals, sharper animation, and (somewhat) better use of the English language.\n\nIf you have to buy this game, at least do yourself a favour and buy the soundtrack too. The music is excellent.","November 25, 2013","false","0.1"," 58 of 80 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","58","80","0","0"

Many of the puzzles in this game are so cryptic that it borders on the impossible. At least one puzzle even included a QR code, which was useless to me since I don't own a smartphone.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Futurato/recommended/224760/","Futurato","Futura&!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Futurato/","610 products in account","There has been much praise and criticism thrown in the direction of Fez since its release in 2012, both for the quality of the game itself and also to reprimand and counteract the behavior of its PR disaster of a creator, Phil Fish. I have no doubt that there are already dozens of reviews more (or less) verbose, or critical, or exultant than mine if you're looking for something to exactly echo your crystallized and inexorable opinion of a game that came out over a year ago. Reservoirs of digital ink have long been drained on this topic. If you're sick of Fez reviews, I'd probably skip this one.\n\nBut certainly, Fez is just one of those games that is irresistible to discuss when given a new chance to do so. If you'll kindly excuse yet another Fez review, I'll take my turn at saying a few things, for I love this game unconditionally.\n\nThe genre of artsy indie platformers has become defined by several hits from the recent (and ongoing) indie game boom. Fez falls in line with the other standouts of the genre by providing satisfying platforming, a distinct visual design, and an exploration of some high-flying literary theme. Now I don't fault people who rail against the critical praise afforded these titles; after all, the desire for pure gameplay is a real one and these games tend to deliver on feel more often than complexity. I know I'm not changing the minds of these gamers. Fez is a leisurely collectathon with solid platforming and one core mechanic that works just right but only provides just enough. A decent game, if you like its particular blend of familiarity and novelty, but only that.\n\nHowever, for those of you who like your games as gameplay plus x – for those of you who like a world that can hold you with its beauty, and for those who understand wanderlust and long for adventure and movement for their own sake – Fez is that.\n\nEach node of Fez's game map is a little world unto itself. Each contains a secret or two that gets you closer to your end goal, but there exists a curious joy in the universe's "non-functional" elements. Infinite bookshelves encase a planetarium. A frightening mechanical tower hides within an unassuming lighthouse. Neon signs surround a floating bus stop that was surely once part of an ancient transportation hub. Seagulls squawk and waves break with a digital timbre. Ambient synth lines become synonymous with the environment over which they sometimes float and at other times cascade. Sometimes, deadly patches of glitch will manifest as crackling areas of starry space framed by RGB static. Magnificent sights and sounds surround you at every turn as both obstacles and gifts, giving you a wonderful sense of exploration into a beautiful unknown.\n\nEven the game's more obtuse secrets arguably offer their own meta-appeal. Upon searching the Internet for ciphers to translate the game's fictional languages and passwords, I found that I had stumbled upon a community of virtual archaeologists. Scholars who had faced the same questions and decided to leave behind guides for inevitable explorers to come. I probably think too much of these sorts of things, but there is something special about a small game getting big. There's a charm to imagining a million identical, parallel universes of Fez being explored and solved in tandem. It was an unexpected group experience nested within a singleplayer one.\n\nFez: a game considered by many to be overrated – and I've done that perception no favors. I will admit that I might just be the right kind of pretentious to discover and enjoy accidental meaning where there isn't any. Still, the potency of my experiences stands. Fez is charming, whimsical, simple. However, the great mass of language devoted to it might exist because it is also magic, despite whatever anyone else might say. To those of you who romanticize adventure, Fez might just be the love letter you've been waiting for.","November 27, 2013","true","19.5"," 199 of 316 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","199","316","0","7"

FEZ emphases on platforming, hidden puzzles, and exploration. The Music, graphics, and gameplay are all wrapped up into a nice indie niche game.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=517386182\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: You play the game as Gomez, “a 2D creature living in a 2D world. Or is he?” Gomez is presented with a Fez that reveals his 2D world is actually a 3D world. Gomez is then sent out on a journey to collect cubes and cube fragments to bring balance back to the universe.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=517386227\n\nGameplay: The movement controls are basic for PC controls, movement and jump. The unique ability is that the player can adjust the camera angle, the whole game freezes as the camera angle changes, giving the player a considerable amount of recovery time (For example, you might jump off a cliff, and try to stick a landing on a different 2D platform, when you change the perspective the game will pause for the animation of changing camera angles.)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=517386257\n\nAchievements: All of the achievements on the game are related to your progress on collecting all the various cubes in the game. The first two achievements are easily unlocked, however the rest will require extensive playing, puzzle solving, or dumb luck. (I have no shame in admitting I had to use a guide to finding the last 10-15 cubes I needed at the end. Those were hard!)\n\nPrice: FEZ is priced at $9.99, without a guide this game will definitely take you longer then 10 hours to figure out all the puzzles. The game price is pretty fair for how much time I personally spent in the game, I would recommend waiting for a steam sale before purchasing FEZ, I also picked my copy up on a Humblebundle deal.\n\nConclusion: It is worth pointing out that I strongly disagree with FEZ Designer Phil Fish's behavior over social media and lashing out on twitter, exclaiming: “Seriously, shut the F*** up about Fez 2. never going to happen. You don't deserve it”. (Reference: http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/18/fez-2-is-never-going-to-happen-says-fish)\nRegardless of Phil Fish's antics, FEZ itself is still a very solid enjoyable indie game that I can easily recommend to anyone who enjoys puzzle games.\nTo quickly recap, Story: enough to keep you interested on finding out what happens at the end. Not much dialogue. Gameplay: Innovative, interesting, enjoyable. Achievements: Difficult to get 100% without guides, I suggest trying to get as far as you can without looking up guides. Price: $9.99 fair price for the time spent in game, I always suggest sales for a better price.","September 15, 2015","true","11.5"," 34 of 43 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","34","43","0","0"

However, I finished the game a little disappointed.\n\nThe game presents itself as a platformer with an interesting central mechanic.  You roam the world in two dimensions, but can spin the world in 90 degree turns.  This allows you to run across platforms that might be too far to jump from one perspective or discover hidden doors that only appear in another perspective.  However, the depth of this mechanic is never really explored.  You will see about 90% of the way the mechanic is used before you leave the tutorial area, which was a bit disappointing.  There are a few more mechanics that are used (like bombs or rotating platforms), but their implementation is shallow and uninspired at best.  The game also does a poor job of explaining itself to the player.  I’m not complaining that the game doesn’t literally tell me how to progress, but in a puzzle game care should be taken to have puzzles which demonstrate mechanics (and by extension let the player understand those mechanics) and puzzles which implement those mechanics.  The Portal series is a great example of this, featuring chambers where the player will learn the mechanics in a safe environment before going into a chamber that uses those same mechanics but leaves the player to discover how to beat the chamber.\n\nThe entire game revolves around collecting Cubes and Bits (which are smaller fragments, eight of which make a regular cube).  The game revolves around a hub based system, where several doors appear that require a certain amount of cubes to unlock.  What the game doesn’t tell you is that there are also several hidden Anti-Cubes.  The only reason I discovered this was because I was looking at achievement descriptions and found one which just read “RTRTLTRTRTLTLTLT.”  I input the code in the game and I ended up getting one of these cubes.  This is where I realized the whole point of Fez wasn’t the platforming, it was the meta aspect of the puzzle solving.\n\nI noticed there were a lot of symbols on walls and looked online to see if they were just decoration or if there was any meaning to them.  I soon realized that there was a whole alphabet, numeral scheme, and even symbols that represent button controls (a good guide for this is here).  I wrote these down and tried to decode what I could as I played.  I found a few more anti-cubes, and unlocked a lot more areas, before I beat the game.  But yet, the shadow of the gameplay hung over me.  The platforming feels slow, with “pull-up” animations taking forever, and jumps feeling floaty and imprecise.  I usually love hub-based areas, but the warp-gates (usually located at the end of a branch of levels) are few and far between.  In fact, there are so many different ‘levels’ that a fast travel system would have been much appreciated.  There were many times that I wanted to jump to a different level in a separate branch but had to progress backwards three or four levels just to get back to the hub world.\n\nThis game is great fun if you love cryptography and puzzle solving.  Not only are there button codes to enter, but also QR codes to find, as well as (perhaps my most favorite) special areas that vibrate certain sides of the controller to hint at the button code you need to enter.  The die-hard Fez fandom spent months decoding secrets in the game, and if you don’t use a walkthrough on your first playthrough you will probably have entire worlds left unexplored.  However, most people will buy this game expecting a platformer with cool art, but the staleness of the gameplay will leave them disappointed.","December 20, 2013","false","7.9"," 365 of 618 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","365","618","0","9"

Underneathe the layers of retro love and chiptunes there's really nothing to it. Cited as a triumph of indie development, Fez is anything but that. Kindling for internet flame wars, the "game" is unremarkable outside of that.\n\nMany review outlets praised this game as if it were some incredible artistic achievement. You think they were giving you an honest review of it?\n\nDemonstrating an incredible knack of leaving things unrealized, the POV manipulation could have really been cool if Fish pursued it. In the end, it just ended up being a stupid gimmick. Constantly adjusting your view to partake of mediocre platforming is really all this game is. Kind would be the best way to describe this game as it respawns you back where you failed a jump and lacks enemies all together.\n\nCentral to the game's charm is the retro visuals which really aren't that good. Honestly, the retrogames we grew up with pusehd the hardware and tried to make something look good. Other retrostyled games looked better, like Dust. Keeping with the trend of disappointment, the game can't even make platforming feel satisfying. Even though it's the focus, the controls have this really awful feeling of being both stiff and floaty.\n\nOf course, the absolutely biggest problem is that the game is one big fetch-quest and scavenger hunt, like a Rare game on N64. No enemies, no bosses, nothing but gathering little cubes.\n\nIn the end, your money is better spent elsehwere.

In particular, getting around the map is a complete chore, even with the assorted teleporters floating around.\n\nThe other game is a series of obscure hidden riddles, one of which was so fiendish the community had to solve it by brute force rather than by "solving" the puzzle.

It played exactly like the movie promoted matching what I had envisioned, yet the game ended up being quite a bit deeper than I anticipated with a plethora of doors and warp gates in which I ultimately got lost trying to maneuver through. There are also a lot of extra secrets and ciphers which aren't necessary to complete the game, but are rewarding if you spend the extra time to discover them.

Potential, I said.\n\nIn FEZ you basically have to collect Yellow Cubes (32 max), Blue Cubes (anti-cubes, 32 max) to unlock doors. You unlock the ending after collecting 32 regardless of colour. There are also 3 "easter egg" Red Cubes which do not count towards anything.\n\nTo obtain most Yellow Cubes (and thus complete the game) you need nothing but this R&P mechanic, which is essential to reach some places. After few minutes you get the grip of it and it gets old. It gets easy, too easy; it is just interesting, not really challenging.\n\nThe hype is about the *other cubes*.\n\nSeveral Blue Cubes are trivial as well, some of them are fun... but... *none of them are about the R&P mechanic*. To unlock these cubes here you usually need to press some buttons in a specific order, usually in a specific room. The "challenge" resides in finding the said sequence, but finding them does not depend on the R&P mechanic either, and at this point you'd be just playing a regular platform game where you use R&P merely to reach different rooms.\n\nWhereas some combinations are readily available in their own room, some others require hints hunting throughout the FEZ world - and that's the only hard part of the game. Searching for patterns and glyphs throughout the world - which is very confusing to navigate - in a sea of things which could be a hint for a puzzle or just decoration... no problems if you have a photographic memory or a memory just good enough to remember "where did I see these symbols before?" but otherwise you would need to be paranoid like myself and take a screenshot of 50% of the rooms in the game just to make sure you will have those symbols available in case you need them sooner or later. Some of them can be bruteforced as well, which can be far more enjoyable than travelling in FEZ's map.\n\nWhile you might enjoy hint-hunting kind of games, even that is not clever: the hints are straightforward and require very little brainwork after you actually find them (I enjoyed cracking the counting cube though). You just go "there and use it" - no clever use of the R&P mechanic either. That is definitely not what I expected from this game here.\n\nLastly, Red Cubes. Not even funny. By analogy, I would say that the red cubes are equivalent to the following riddle:\n"_____ ____ have I, two below and ___ in a ____; Then ____ ____ one kills, ____ . What is my name?"\nThis is not a clever riddle, its just incomplete. In the same way, there is nothing clever about the red cubes. It is okay though since they were supposed to be "easter eggs", they do not progress the game and the devs were not insane enough to put them as achievements.\n\nAll in all, the game is interesting, but it doesn't deserve the hype. The awesome mechanic was not properly exploited by the devs.","November 1, 2014","false","51.7"," 123 of 217 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","123","217","2","10"

I'm sure everyone's tired of them. But, you should get over it and play Fez. I can't imagine why you haven't already. You've seen all the praise right? Well if you are holding back from playing Fez to look cool, or because you hate Phil Fish, really, you are only hurting yourself.\n\nIf you have an ounce of interest in puzzles or platformers, or puzzle platformers, congratulations! You should own this, you should play it and figure everything out. The aesthetics are exremely well done, but i'm not going to dwell on them. Fez's key mechanic is perspective shifting. You are a 2D character that can  rotate which face of a 3D world you are on. I am not going to pretend this mechanic is brand new (Ortho comes to mind, though there is probably an older example), but it is done extremely well and makes for some very interesting puzzles. On top of the dizzying perspective switching, there is also a whole language you have to learn to solve some of the puzzles.\n\nThe ending is also one of the most beautiful things i've seen and the new game plus features one of the best punch lines out there.

The game has many secrets and some puzzles are quite challenging -  solving them without getting help from the internet is quite an accomplishment. On top of that, the atmosphere is simply astonishing. Each location has its unique magic and charm underlined by fantastic soundtrack. FEZ's unique game mechanics is more than just a gimmick and works really well - although I'm under impression that its potential isn't quite fully exploited.

If you're into exploring, this game is for you. The controls are simple. Arrow keys for movement, up for going in doors, a button for jump, 2 buttons for shifting perspective either left or right, a button to interact and a button to talk. When you shift perspective its like a whole new map. When you shift perspective its like a whole new 2D level even if its the same area, making the game unique.\n\nSo what do you do in Fez? Collect cubes and bits. Yep, 8 bits make 1 cube. The whole game is based on collecting cubes in a giant beautiful world. What do you do with the cubes? Not much.... unlock doors to access new areas. When you're in the level itself you'll see bits send out rippling diamonds so if a bit even if its behind a wall. It is just less wasted time looking for something when you need to twist the level around four times. There are puzzles to figure out that make for a nice challenging diversion different than anything else in the game which is mostly just traversal and exploration.\n\nThen why play Fez? The game is just soothing and relaxing. Good music, beautiful art style full of color, and most importantly very forgiving gameplay. You really can't die. You will respawn from exactly where you were. There are no enemies, but you will fall to your death a lot only to respawn where you were, thus preventing situations where you're at the top of a tower and fall only to reclimb. The respawn prevents that. Platforming is forgiving this way, not to mention the fact you can catch onto ledges and pull yourself up or drop down.\n\nThankfully the game has a good map system that shows you warp gates, small gates, treasures, locked doors, cubes, bits and secrets that you haven't found in each area. Plus if you've been in an area before, you can see a glimpse of the area through the door before you enter the area. On top of that, you can see areas in the background, that when you enter the door the camera will slowly drift that background area to become the new area you're in. Its a really nice system, I just wish the transition was faster.\n\nThere is so much quality content here with diverse vibrant colors, complete with a day and night cycle to ensure the area will look different even if its your 10th time there. In all, its a game focused around exploration and traversal made by a man that the Internet seems to hate.","October 9, 2013","true","6.7"," 122 of 227 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","122","227","0","0"

It's definitely not for everyone, but I still think it's worth trying out.\n\nTo get the bad out of the way, there are quite a few extremely, EXTREMELY cryptic puzzles in the game.  I won't lie, I resorted to using guides for most of them, as I lack the patience for this kind of stuff, but if you're someone who refuses to use guides, prepare to get a pen and paper, and put on your thinking cap.  Some of the puzzles just feel overly cryptic, and you have to do a lot of brainstorming, experimenting, and trial and error to solve them.\n\nThat's honestly my only real complaint with the game.  The world and art style of the game are very charming and nostalgic in a way, and the soundtrack is amazing.  The 3D world rotation mechanic that the game is built around works well, and is very fun to play around with.\n\nIf you're a fan of puzzle platformers, I'd highly recommend the game.","April 30","true","19.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

There is not much to the game besides very simple platforming and puzzles which you complete in order to progress through the game. The problem is the puzzles are either too easy or incredibly cryptic being impossible to figure out without some sort of outside knowledge. For example the game has hieroglyphics though the game that translate into button sequences which you press in order to unlock things. Or random QR codes that will display button sequences when using a QR reader. None of these are fun or challenging in any way, just obscure and tedious.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kungfulemon/recommended/224760/","kungfulemon","Mirkwood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kungfulemon/","245 products in account","One of my favourite gaming experiences in recent times. On the surface it's an incredibly pleasant exploration/collection game with some puzzles and platforming. The huge size of the world alone satisfies me; I love to lose myself in FEZ. The game is beautiful to look at and the aesthetic is perfect for my tastes. The soundtrack is also really lovely, and gels perfectly with the visuals.\n\nIf you look deeper though, it gets deeper. There are languages and codes to decipher, remarkable hidden worlds and cryptic, world-size puzzles to wrap your head around. Not to mention a surprisingly dense and interesting backstory to uncover.\n\nLots of people dislike this game because its creator, Phil Fish, is a bit of a ♥♥♥♥. But I think it's silly to let that stop us enjoying his work. Don't let this game's development drama and backstory lead to preconceptions. Like most games it’s not perfect, but it's very polished and there is a lot of attention to detail. A huge amount of passion went into this game, and it really comes through.\n\nEven though the environments are predominately very pleasant, with bright blue skies and luscious greenery, Gomez wanders through the immense world outside his village alone. The outer worlds are almost completely void of sentient life, without even enemies to keep him company. Despite the mostly inviting landscapes, I find myself feeling an almost petrifying sense of loneliness and emptiness as I explore the world and uncover just how strange it is. This loneliness only adds to the feeling of size and vastness the game's world has.\n\nThat loneliness, I think, also amplifies the great satisfaction you feel when you figure out one of the harder puzzles in the game, for example one of the coded languages. Unless you are a genius however, you WILL eventually have to Google a couple of solutions at some point, if you want to 100% it. (Which is actually 209.4% according to the game.)\n\nBeautiful, creepy, sometimes very clever, and above all... Immensely charming. I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game.","December 20, 2013","true","27.6"," 38 of 70 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","38","70","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dunkelschwamm/recommended/224760/","Dunkelschwamm","Dunkelschwamm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dunkelschwamm/","560 products in account","I Really Wanted To Enjoy This\nI want to start by saying that none of the following has anything to do with the people who created it, gaming politics, or the delays that plagued this game before its release.  I don't care about any of that.  I just wanted to review this game based on my experiences with it and that's what I'm going to do.\n\nThings that I liked\nThe gimmick is a great, creative idea.\nThe idea that you have a somewhat traditional 2d side-scrolling platformer game where you can rotate the camera 90 degrees to abuse third dimensional space from a second dimensional prespective is genius.  To that end, the game is loaded with all sorts of fun ways to use this gimmick in a way that just feels good.  Many of the puzzles are well thought out, and the more challenging ones really do make the player feel smart for having mastered this new perspective.\nThe gameplay feels really good.\nOne of the best parts of this game is the player's mobility.  You can run, jump, climb, hang off of ledges, shimmy around ledges, pick things up, throw things, turn wheels with the perspective shift, and shift perspective in mid jump.  All of this feels really good and makes the gameplay smooth.  Nothing feels terribly floaty and the camera borders and jump height/distance were never an issue.\nThe graphics are nice to look at.\nThis was one of the things that really got me wanting to play the game in the first place.  The game has great color schemes in every area, dynamic skies that change based on your elevation in a level, and creatively decorated tilesets.  Most environments are littered with animated NPC wildlife who frolick despite the player's intrusions and the game just has a ton of character in its art style.  Things look especially good when the pixel art is translated to voxel art during the brief moments where the world rotates to a new perspective.\nThe game is mostly laid back, allowing you to take things in at your own pace.\nFEZ allows the player to explore the world with little limitation other than occasional gates which require collected items before the player can pass.  Many of the best finds in the game are shortcuts which make traversing areas much faster.  Death is also rarely an issue and will usually only put the player back on the last static platform they were standing on, making the game relatively low stakes.\nThings that I didn't like so much\nThe game is very glitchy\nI'm not going to act like we should expect an experimental style of game like this to be devoid of any kinds of bugs or glitches.  However, this game has bugs and glitches often enough that it really does become distracting.  Not only this, but during some segments where the game actually finally grows a difficulty with stakes I'll often find myself sent to the beginning of the segment due to glitches caused by moving platforms, the perspective shifting feature, or interactive elements that decide to start propelling the player in odd directions once they're touched.  More than once this also rendered a segment unbeatable, requiring me to restart the area or the game.  This also prompted at least one rage quit after being repeatedly sent to the beginning of a timed platforming segment due to glitchy platforms.\nThe game drags in areas that it really shouldn't\nThis is really upsetting to me.  One of the biggest draws for getting this game is getting to explore a colorful, populated, fascinating pixel world packed to the brim with lots of character.  And most of the time the game fulfills that!  However, I often find myself spending lots of time travelling through very samey looking environments in a particular area which offer multiple versions of the same puzzle (which sometimes waaay overstay their welcome, such as during a particular sewer segment or another segment with invisible platforms).  During these parts of the game I found myself extremely bored with no idea how long I would be stuck scouring the area until I could deem it completed so I could move on.  Perhaps it would have been better for me to leave the area once it got boring and come back later, but then that would have meant that I would need to spend time...\nBacktracking\nIn a Metroidvania style game backtracking is a given.  However, this isn't a Metroidvania style game.  What makes backtracking work in those games is that the environments that you backtrack through are transformed by the player's new abilities (ie; a pit of lava with a monster in it may be deadly at first, but with an ice beam the monster becomes a platform).  FEZ does none of this.  So far as I know the player never actually gets any new powers and spends the entire game with the same set of platforming skills.  The unique things that he can do are contextual to the level and can't really be taken backwards through the game.  Instead, backtracking is just a matter of finding a key or object which acts like a key and then checking your map to route the fastest way to jump through familiar environments back to the door you need to open.  It makes parts of the game that were once fun and interesting stale.  It isn't playing through the levels with new eyes, it's just repeating the same gameplay in a way that feels like a waste of time.\nAs a whole, FEZ is a flawed execution of a lot of good ideas.  The platforming is smooth, but is marred by glitches which can ruin the flow.  The concept is great, but the novelty wears off fast through repetitve backtracking and multiple versions of samey puzzles.  The graphics are great but the real gems are spread out through giant mazes of platforming puzzles which look nearly identical to the ones before them.  The game is frustrating for the thought of what it could have been if time were spent polishing it rather than constantly trying to build upon it.  It has its moments, but they're spaced out by monotonous and occasionally frustrating space inbetween.  The sloppiness of its execution brings to mind the genius concepts and lackluster execution of Flash browser games from the mid 2000's.\n\nI would value this game at anywhere between $4.00 to $6.00 USD if you're really curious about it.  There's certainly moments that can make the game worth your money, but overall it works best as a time waster.  Feels like it would work so much better on mobile than on computers so a player could whip out their phone between classes and make incremental progress.\n\nRatings:\nGameplay: 6/10\nGraphics: 8/10\nAudio: 6/10\nPolish: 4/10\nDesign: 5/10\n\nI can't recommend it myself.  There's certainly elements here that have tons of potential but I don't see that they're given proper opportunity to shine.","January 14","false","8.9"," 103 of 196 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","103","196","5","6"

And even then..\n\nFez is overhyped. It is nothing more than a regular run-of-the-mill platformer that relies on a substitution cipher ("a method of encoding by which units of plaintext are replaced with ciphertext") combined with lazy puzzles and the ability to rotate your game-view four times every other minute (which gets old very fast). Fez makes itself longer by sending you on long go-here-go-there-go-back missions, and then once you complete the game, it tells you to basically revisit 90% of the areas you had already visitied, using sunglasses that lets you zoom-in on the world and examine for hints, and while granted that game-mechanic is slightly innovative, it is merely a prolonging of the game, and it could have been available from the get-go, instead of after you beat the story. And speaking of prolonging the game, lets not forget the part where you had to wait around for four owls which only appear at night in-game. On top of that, EVEN WORSE, you had to wait for, not one, but FOUR analog watches to reach 12:00, each taking a minute, an hour, a day and two days respectively in real time to do so (alternatively you could cheat and change your PC's system time setting, but still).\n\nIt has a cutesy (albeit very short and unimaginative) story, that is what people love the most, I have noticed that, and I will not argue against it, because who would not love that adorable little marshmallow man with a fez?\n\nStay Fezt, do not waste your time.","April 18, 2014","false","8.1"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","59","13","22","7","0"

Controls, setting and visual style all great.\n\nThere are a lot of rather obtuse puzzles, none of which get in the way of completing the game, but which do come into play if you do a new game + or hunt for achievements. I didn't realize I had to pay as much attention as was necessary, and probably because I wasn't worrying too much, I beat the game in about 3 hours. When I went to start "new game plus" the next time I played, I say that my "completion" was at something like 140%. I HATE IT when games allow more than 100% completion, because it just makes it difficult/impossible to judge if you've gotten every collectible.\n\nI ended playing an extra 2 hours and collected almost all the other cubes. The gameplay is good, but not good enough for me to want to spend more than 5 hours in this game. I ended up at "186% completion", having no idea how far I was to having everything, so i checked an online guide for the first time since starting to play. Apparently I could get up to 209%. The puzzles i missed were: the 4th "change your system time" puzzle, one that involved converting Morse Code to Binary to ASCII, and one that involved translating way too much of the game's "alien language". I should note that none of the puzzles are very directly hinted at during the game. The number system was easy enough to figure out as pretty much the exact same system has been done in other games (which explained it more clearly), the tetris system is decoded in a late-game room,  and the game does give you a map telling you if there are remaining secrets in each area, so a bit of trial and error get you through.\n\nThe puzzles I didn't get were so obtuse and/or clunky that i feel like the game requires online guides, which is a shame and points somewhat to poor design.\n\nI would have given the game a 10/10 if it was only based on my first, "ignorant" playthrough, but the stupid "more than 100% possible" mechanic, and the ridiculously obtuse puzzles required to finish the New Game + and achievements bothered me and actually made me feel like their was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ among the designers. Being forced to change your system clock or play your game at 4AM is a BAD GAMING MECHANIC. Anyways, endgame left a bad taste in my mouth, so that 10/10 is now more of a 7.5/10.","March 23, 2014","true","9.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Some people might find this game too hard or challenging. Some people might not like puzzle games. So if you might be one of those people, then you probably won't like this game.\n\nNow then, let me start off this review by saying, HOLY FLIPPING CHEESE NUTS IS THIS GAME GOOD. I mean, it won awards for a reason you know. The puzzles in this game will drive you insane, in a good way. This game is so hard that there is one puzzle that has NEVER BEEN SOLVED. I had to look up a walkthrough to finish this game, and if you are thinking of giving up, I strongly encourage you not to until you are absoloutly stuck.\n\nIf the puzzles weren't enough to make you want to spend all your money to buy you and all your friends this gem of a game, you should know that the visuals are FRICKIN AMAZING LOOKING and that whoever worked on this game should have screenshots of FEZ put up in an art museum or sold for billions at auctions.\n\nThen there are the game mechanics. And yeah, jumping and pushing switches is cool, but JESUS CHRIST CAN YOU BELIEVE NAVIGATING A 2D GAME IN 3D. IT WORKS SO DANG WELL. This kind of platforming is only spoken about in legend you guys it's amazing\n\nAnd now for the plot, yeah I know what you're thinking. How can such a simple platformer have a plot? And to that I must say, ARE YOU SERIOUS BRO, IN THIS GAME YOU CAN COLLECT THE BROKEN PARTS OF A GIANT HEXEHEDRON WHO SPEAKS A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE YOU CAN COMPREHEND THE MEANING OF THE UNIVERSE HECK YOU CAN EVEN TRANSLATE A BOOK FULL OF HAIKUS FROM DEAD ALIENS WHO BUILT STAR GATES AND SHRINES ON FLOATING ISLANDS ON TOP OF THE CLOUDS\n\nThen there is the music. If the fact that this game's OST was developed by Disasterpiece wasn't enough to make you want to spend $ 7.00 so you can play it to yourself while you need creative inspiration. I have to say this soundtrack IS LIKE HAVING A SYMPHONY OF PIXELATED ANGELS SING INTO YOUR EARS.\n\nIn all seriousness guys, this game had me hooked for a long time, and I just couldn't think about anything else until I finished it. You may not love this game as much as I do, but just know that when I first started playing this game, I grew bored with it, until I started to understand what was happening, then I loved it. I strongly urge you to give this game a try, and I hope if you are reading this review you are moved to buy it.\n\n10/10\n\nPlus you get a sweet lookin hat","May 22","true","15.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Now I know, and indeed have played and enjoyed, many other games in this genre, things like monument valley and the like are a staple of my mobile gaming as well, so I am no stranger to the genre of dimensional movement in games, but FEZ still managed to keep me entertained in a way that most of those other games do not.  First, the game manages to maintain a cohesive and interesting storyline while breaking down puzzles into logical pieces without interrupting the flow.  The rotation of the character in the 3d space is seamless and lends itself perfectly to puzzles, making the game easy to learn without sacrificing the potential for extremely difficult puzzles.  The graphics are absolutely gorgeous for pixelated 2d sprites, and the 3d vectorized graphics do not detract from the overall feel of the game, nor do they feel out of place in the world.  The sound design is fantastic, and though the keyboard controls are a bit odd, they are easy enough to get used to, and using the steam controller makes things even easier.\n\nNow I admit to being a sucker for retro gaming, so games like this already have a solid place in my heart, FEZ, however, kept me entertained in a way that many retro games currently do not.  The gameplay mechanic was interesting enough, and the concept strong enough that I honestly had to stop myself at the 60 minute timer.  I fully intend to go back to playing this once I’m done writing here; this will probably be my spare time quick play game for a while.  I cannot recommend this enough.

I am not a fan of huge-pixel games (although I am a gamer since the 1980's), but for this game the pixel-art fits the gameplay perfectly. It could have been more fun if some travelling aid would have been introduced during end-game, but it is just a faint complaint. A bigger issue for me was the clock tower anti-cubes. It is no fun to be forced to show up at a specific time at a specific place. I can practice this in real-life more than enough. I guess I will never make the 32 anti-cubes because of the last 3 one.\nApart from that I have no regret having played Fez.

The game should introduce the mechanisms you need to use to solve the puzzle, and then present you with harder and harder puzzles... not hide the mechanisms. Hidden mechanisms are frustrating, not challenging.\n\nCase in point: I spent a lot of time in an area trying to figure out what the hell I needed to do before resorting to Google for a solution... only to find out I needed to have headphones on... Seriously? The game couldn't have used high/low pitched sounds to represent left/right instead of having the same sound play on the left and right channels?\n\nCombined with all the backtracking that is required made this a very frustrating game to play through.","March 1","false","4.1"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","11","19","0","0"

So many are literally half-done, half-thought-out, just bad games.  And that's sort of the point.  Its an indie game, it doesn't have to be good, someone just has to want to publish it.\n\nBut Fez IS good.  I think it is one of the games that pushed the indie game market to what it is now.\n\nWhen I first started playing I was initially unimpressed.  I only bought the game after watching the Indie Game Movie and wanting to give it a shot.  but at first glance it was rough.  Two things, 1: plug in an xBox controller.  The PC controls are counter-intuitive.  2: don't judge the graphics until you've unlocked the 3d mode, they improve significantly.\n\nIts hard to describe but the world just has a polished nice feel and atmosphere.  I almost feel like I am in a Nintendo game because everything is put together so well.\n\nSo I definitely recommend this one; and that is special because platformers rarely win my approval.\n\nUPDATE Nov 23 2014:  I've unlocked a majority of the game, but now I have trouble navigating to the areas that still need to be unlocked.  I really like the game but I'm frusturated that I may not see the ending because I'm just not very skilled in platformers.","July 28, 2014","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you don't know Phil Fish, all you need to know is that he's kind of an *sshole who thinks everyone who isn't him is awful.\n\nPhil Fish aside, this game is pretty interesting.  It's a game where you need to switch your mind between 2D and 3D, to remember the differences yet forget the differences all based on perspective, which I find is a very good idea.  My main complaint is that it's occassionally cryptic, even when the answer is staring you in the face.\n\nA lot of the time you'll wonder how to do something without having the game give you a single explanation of how to solve a puzzle (Only...it does, but without the right hints and tips on how to understand Fezian without a guide, it seems almost impossible to accomplish without a guide).  Some puzzles are nice and all....but others require you to learn a brand new fictional language in order to understand what is said.\n\nIt's not a TERRIBLE game and it is innovative, however there are many moments that make the game just feel like a chore rather than something fun.  Personally speaking, it is a decent title, but in the end, I found it to be quite a headache.  If you find it in a bundle or on sale, feel free to nab it for an interesting experience...if you don't mind headaches.\n\n4/10","August 20, 2014","false","19.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/choloyolo/recommended/224760/","choloyolo","Humourous Defier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/choloyolo/","66 products in account","Fez is an independent game exclusively for the XBOX LIVE ARCADE, until pleas from fans from 26 countires wanted this beloved game to be on the pc. And fianlly here it is. Fez, for pc, mac, and linux.\nFez is a twist to the puzzle, and strategy genre. It Incorporates 3D mechanics, where you can see in more than three different perspectives. To change your perspective in the game itself, the player simply needs to press the A and D buttons alternately. It's simple, and great fun, to see the whole world of Fez in a cube sized manner.\n\nStory: The story of Fez revolves around the protagonist Gomez (Mexican?) who one day was foretold a prophecy from the elder of his village. Gomez is a 2D character who seems to live in a 2D world. Until an artifact of great power and sentient artifact revealed to him a third, mysterious dimension!!\n\nGameplay: Fez, approximately takes up to 20 hour to over 100 hours campaign, if your'e bad with puzzles. Actually if you hate puzzles, don't buy this game at all. The world of Fez is in 2D, but you can play in 3D perspectives. Each world has 4 sides. You, as the player can freely rotate in 90 degree increments between these perspectives. This way, you will be able to navigate yourslef around this lush and colorful world discovering treasures and artifacts!! The whole purpose of the game is to discover and unearth treasure!\n\nUniqueness: Fez is a game where there is no bosses, no enemies, no combat. In fact, there is no violence at all in the whole game. You can die, but there are no penalties given, and you will respawn at the nearest spawn checkpoint. Fez aims to be a non-threatening world filled with ambiance and life, which makes it a unique game to spend some time in.\n\nPros: Fez has an amazing soundtrack which throughly compliments the game, and immerses you deeper in the puzzle genre. Sometimes I find myself listening to the soundtrack than actually playing the game. If you have a baby of any gender, I recommend you turn this soundtrack on and help them lsiten to it. There are no boundaries, unlike many platform/puzzle games. You can explore any world, of any kind, in any order you want. The world map is very well manufactured, following the 3D mechanics in-game.\n\nCons: The game itself at times becomes to be a sort of a rage game, and a time consuming puzzle you can never be able to pass. The game lacks hints, therefore makes the player stuck on a single puzzle for hours. The gaeme can be seen in more than 3 perspectives, which gives you more opportunites to break your brain. When I went through more thsn 50 hours of gameplay, I felt extremely brain-fried int he process.\n\nIf you have been playing games for a while, you might have noticed there's a change on how games are made. Not just in visual fidelity, or story telling depth, but in how the way it entertains. Fez doesn't have a clear story, but that's the point of it. Games used to do much little, and Fez remembers why this made games great. It burrows ideas from a long gone era, and mashes them together with original ideas. Therefore it reinvents the oldest as well as beloved gaming genres.\n\nThis is truly a 8-bit game of the future. Fez is all about hip-hop platforming, but that's not the reason it's special. This is a super smart puzzle game which traverses beyond the usual boundaries of puzzle games. It makes you think, which many games have ceased or lacked to do for a very long time.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 9.5/10. Fez is a one of a kind game, which makes man gamers rethink the puzzle/strategy genre. It has smart levels, rotating levels, outstanding art work, and finally but not least, a fun and creative world to explore. You will love it, if you are patient that is.","January 18, 2014","true","3.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The red hat isn’t just an exotic accessory. It allows you to manipulate the world by rotating it sideways. And of course you don’t just receive it: getting ahold of such a powerful artifact is accompanied by the appearance of a giant golden hexahedron spewing cyphered messages at you, tearing the space-time continuum and “resetting” the game.\n\nYou wake up once again and go out of the familiar house. At first glance — nearly nothing’s changed. Villagers still wander around minding their own 2D business, but you know you can see more, can reach places you couldn’t reach before. And that will help you on your quest that your newest Zelda-referencing flying companion, four-dimensional hypercube named Dot tells you about. Collect the cubes. Open the doors. Save the world… perhaps?\n\nFez rightfully assumes that for now all you need is more of that gorgeous scenery. It was enough for the game to receive two IGF awards despite being still in development both times. And it is in its right being so confident about its looks. Visual styles so distinctive and appealing don’t appear every day. It’s retro and modern at the same time, a lovechild of technological experimentation multiplied by childhood nostalgia. It took its creator Phil Fish more than five years to build a game around the initial trixel idea, which makes you wonder just how much of that time has been spent scraping the work results and redoing stuff all over again. That doesn’t save you from having game-breaking bugs in the final product, but it nearly guarantees having a puzzle so difficult, that it took the community a whole year to crack it “properly”.\n\nThe mystery of the black monolith was initially brute-forced by collective online effort. But of course that solution was far from satisfying to say the least. Uncovering the logic behind the artifact that was not so easy to discover in the first place would be a proper way. There was no shortage of fourth-wall breaking hints before with QR codes, pop-culture references and messages encoded in binary with the star patterns of first “regular” ending. Fez teases you, challenges you to solve it; the game gives you the deciphering key to its baffling coded messages with a visual representation of a famous pangram.\n\nThere was no shortage of theories surrounding an obvious 2001: A Space Odyssey reference, but the reasoning behind it was elusive. Much like the original Clarke's black monolith its counterpart from the game’s gotten its share of explanations, but still stayed unfathomable. Maybe it was its meaning — that we can’t have all the answers. Or maybe it was the ultimate prank of Phil Fish, who managed to keep a three-dimensional nature of the game a secret when it was unveiled in 2007 at TIGSource. In 2008 when the rotating mechanic became known the second cryptic part of the game remained undisclosed. One can only imagine what it takes to keep your mouth shut for so long and not hint it even once.\n\nYour perception of Fez shifts and rotates much like you do within the game world. A slow relaxation of a starting zone gives way to some underlying mystery; then you’re distracted from that with some really smart puzzles that don’t even seem like puzzles at first glance. Finally, when (if) you get through all of this, you get to see the fourth side of the cube. And it blows your mind. These transitions are subtle. You can’t really put your finger on what’s changed at first (except for the big final development). And is that really a change? Maybe it’s just a look from a different angle, a perspective alteration revealing content that was always there, but you were too distracted to notice it. Just to prove this point Fez doesn’t really reward you with anything. It just starts anew leaving you with nothing more than a buzz in your head from all those riddles and suspicious hints to a bigger story.\n\nSupposedly some of them were meant to be picked up in a sequel, but we aren’t getting it anytime soon. Well, time to rotate that cube again then. Maybe there’s something on the side that you’ve missed?","February 10","true","13.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Please ignore the issues sorruounding it's creator as they are not worth focusing on when there is an incredible game behind it all. This game is a one-of-a-kind original piece of art, that is the only way to discribe it. This is a puzzle game which is enough to turn many people away but it has an amazing twist to it: 'Dimension bending' as I like to call it (Althought they probably have an offical name for it). 'Dimension bending' is extreemle difficult to explain and I recomend that you watch a video of some gamplay of FEZ to see how it works. The art style is a beutiful modernised 8 bit which makes me never want to stop looking at it. As a result of the simplistic, yet amazing, graphics, the game runs easily on most system and is loved by many because of this. The sound track for this game is truley mesmorising. It has been created in such a way that it really feels like it belongs in the world that FEZ is set in. You can get a good few hours out of this game (I have not yet completed it on this acount, I have on my other) and is well worth the £7 (Or your equivelant) which is being Charged. In summary, this game is a masterpiece, something which will hopefully inspire amazing games in the future, which diserves credit. Sadly I say that the developer deserves credit for making this (Although I know he is a prick). You as the potential purchaser have a choice: buy an amazing game and don't buy a few pacets of sweets as a subsitute or don't buy it and leave without an amazing 10 or so hours of your life.","March 28, 2015","true","5.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Regardless of whether that is true or not, don't let it deter you from playing this game. All that extraneous stuff aside, FEZ, as a game, is the real deal.\n\nYou play as Gomez, a little dude who lives a nice peaceful life in a 2D world. That is, until about 5 minutes into the game, when he is given a gift - the titular fez - which opens up a whole new world to him. Literally. The fez allows Gomez to rotate his 2D world at any time, to reveal the previously unseen 3rd dimension. For example, there may be a platform that is too far away to jump to, but rotating the world 90 degrees shifts the perspective such that the platform appears to be much closer. You can then jump to it and rotate the world back to where it was, or in any of the other 3 directions. This is the most basic example of the gameplay, but it's also just the beginning. The sheer number of cool ways this one simple mechanic alone has an effect on puzzle-solving and exploration is amazing. It's just really fun to explore and figure things out. Your main goal is to collect a series of special cubes, which are scattered throughout a pretty large world. Some cubes are found intact, but others require collecting smaller cube bits first to create a full cube. That's really all there is to the game. But just saying it that way is a disservice. The puzzles you have to solve to find all these cubes range from simple to - forgive the pun - truly outside-the-box. This is because there is more going on in FEZ than appears on the surface. A major part of solving the game's mysteries involves figuring out various codes outside of the game itself (such as deciphering the number system and alphabet, scanning QR codes, and more). So not only will you need a controller to play this game, but a pad and pencil as well. The game can be completed without finding all of the cubes (and actually has to be the first time through), but in order to get the most out of it, a little bit of extra effort is needed... though I suppose you could also just look up the solutions to some of the more effort-intensive puzzles online. I wouldn't blame you. There were only a few things that brought the game down for me a little bit. The big one was the confusing and mostly ineffectual map. The game world is huge, like really huge, and is connected by a crazy number of doors. It was very difficult to keep track of where you are and how to get somewhere else. And while there is a sort of quick-travel system available, it wasn't really implemented well. The map screen is also overly complicated and buggy. Finally, some of the puzzles I felt stepped a little too far in terms of either their obscure solutions or plain tediousness. But aside from these few minor missteps, FEZ is very much worth playing, especially if you are into platformers, retro-looking graphics, solving codes/mysteries, or games that involve collecting things. Oh, and the music is pretty amazing too. All in all, FEZ is a pretty outstanding game, and well-deserving of all the accolades it has received.\n\nFinal Grade: A-\n\nTechnical notes: You are definitely going to want to play this game using an Xbox360 controller, or equivalent. It was designed to be played with a controller and I can't even imagine how it could even work well otherwise. Some puzzles even require having a controller to figure out. So, just something to keep in mind.","June 2, 2013","true","11.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The first hour or so were very enjoyable for me, as I quite enjoyed the mechanic of being able to change the perspective of the game itself. It allows for some very interesting and honestly diffiult challenges. However, my main problem with the game is that there seems to be no sense of direction. From the moment you acquire the ability to spin the world, the game then says, "There you go, now find these things. Good luck!" This, for many people, may be seen as a good thing. It gives off an intense feeling of, for lack of a better word, ADVENTURE. For me however, I found the world too confusing to navigate and far too large to keep track of. Nitpicking aside, this game has great pixel art, it's really quite astonishing how beautiful the game looks at times. The world-shifting mechanic works perfectly, providing an intense feeling of accomplishment when a puzzle is solved. There are "warp gates" at the ends of areas to help you find you way back to the closest hub-world. Sprinkled throughout the areas are secret zones that provide extreme challenges for these objects called anti-cubes. FEZ in a fantastic game, and if you'd like to go on an adventure where the only limits are set by your puzzle solving abilities; ten dollars is a steal.\n\nNow if only Phil Fish wasn't such an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.","November 15, 2014","true","2.4"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

The puzzles are too complex, too vague, too large for just one person alone. The sad thing about playing Fez this long after its release is you are missing out on the community effort that went into cracking this game wide open. Some of the puzzles were so incredibly cryptic that it took whole community forums to solve them (there is one puzzle in fact that the actual solution is still unknown - it was solved via a brute forcing method that took the whole community to meticulously guess the solution one method at a time till someone accidentally stumbled upon it).\n\nA lot of these puzzles deal with cryptography. They are really really difficult and would take the average person months to crack. I actually went through the trouble of cracking the language myself and that was just one of the most daunting tasks I have ever put towards a video game. By the end of playing Fez there were all sorts of papers strewn all over my room with scribbled notes of symbols and clues.... it was a mess and I felt like a madman but it was a great experience.\n\nWhat I love about Fez is it makes you feel like an archeologist. You don't feel like you are playing a simple game... You feel like you are exploring and investigating this strange universe. There is very little in terms of narrative here... A story is not told to you but instead you feel that a story has been told and you have to piece it together one vague piece at a time. There is something ancient, archaic, and even futurisitc at times about Fez that still, even after completing it, feels... monolithic.\n\nThere are a lot of games that people claim transcend into the world of art, but I think Fez is one of the games that really did it.

I don't think I even read the reviews. But it was on sale, so I got it. This game is so, SO much more than a platformer. As a matter of fact, there isn't even anything to fight. You run around, switch between dimensions...every single "world" (I'm calling them worlds...they're more like floating islands, only accessed by doors from other floating islands) is a puzzle in itself. It's relaxing yet challenging at the same time...relaxing for the lack of any immediate threat (and how forgiving it is...drop from a platform and die, and you reappear one second later), challenging because of the puzzle-solving and the dangers of misusing doors (which I will explain below). I get a sense of pride every time I swap dimensions and I'm positioned perfectly to climb higher up the tower.\n\nBut this game does have a drawback. So...WARNING. I made the mistake of attending college while playing this game, so I had to take a break from it. Having separated myself from the game, it's nearly impossible to get back into it. It's pretty unforgiving as far as door-venturing is concerned. Maybe I don't pay quite enough attention to the little window that shows what's on the already-explored island. I have no way to re-orient myself and get back into the game without that gosh-darn cube telling me I'm tearing holes in the universe or something. This is dangerous stuff. Seriously.\n\nAnyway. I don't know what you're waiting for. Buy the damn game. Love it. Don't abandon it, even for a couple of weeks. You'll regret having done so.\n","August 2, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a beautiful and carefully-crafted indie piece by any stretch, but it might just leave some players feeling hollow. It re-appropriates familiar dimension-breaking mechanics into a lax and elegant platformer that acts more as a means to facilitate world exploration rather than being at the core of the experience. FEZ invites you to take in the richness of detail in its 3D pixelated environments, and parsing its numerous subtleties is both rewarding and revealing of a greater, resonant mystique.\n\nAs a game in the formal sense, it's somewhat lacking. As an interactive artwork, it's so much more. Mitch Dyer of IGN called it “a game in love with games”, and that's a good way to put it. It manages to capture the ethos of 8-Bit nostalgia, glimpses a hypothetical bridge between the 16- and 32-Bit eras, ties itself to concrete reality in ways games don't often do anymore, and eagerly cranes its head toward change in how works of this medium are conceived. All of this, however, will stand as the dividing point for who will and will not enjoy FEZ.\n\nIt's an escape, sure, but I would gladly get lost in FEZ's wistful universe any day.\n\nAnd as an addendum, Rich Vreeland's compositional work for the game, reminiscent of Vangelis, makes me want to weep salty tears of joy every time I hear it.","March 25, 2014","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/richardspectre/recommended/224760/","richardspectre","Richard Spectre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/richardspectre/","185 products in account","FEZ was a pleasant surprise back in the days, when I discovered 'Indie Game: The Movie' for myself.\nAbout one third of the trailer was devoted to FEZ and its creator Phil Fish. That was the moment I recognized the game mechanics very well and was crushed when found out about its exclusivity to Xbox 360.\n\nIn 2012, my dream was to have DRM-free version of FEZ on Linux, my main operating system since 2008.\nNeeded to say, in that time it felt like something that would never happen. But it seems that a miracle happened and Mr. Fish left Microsoft, thanks to his hot temper. By the way, I don't know why so many people hate Phil on that point. Man of art should be impulsive and sensitive, that gives him the true efforts to create.\n\nFirst, he ported FEZ to Windows and I instantly bought it in one of the Humble Bundles, it was so great to have a game, that is truly yours, on a platform that allows you to mod it and do anything you want. My kids will love it too, I am sure.\n\nWhen announcing PC version, he spoke about making the game available for Linux too and I admired this move a lot. My dream was now fulfilled. Thank you, Mr. Fish and especially Renaud Bédard, who is behind the Linux port! I owe you both!\n\n~~~ * * * ~~~\n\nNow, my thoughts about the game directly.\n\nEveryone knows that FEZ is a two-dimensional side-scrolling platformer game, that allows you to actually change your point of view. But many of those who didn't play FEZ don't understand how mature is the view on game design here.\nIts main advantage is all audiences orientation: hardcore gamers can complete the game by discovering all 64 cubes and casual gamers can find half of that amount and enjoy the common ending.\n\nYou can move between the worlds and collect parts of the Hypercube, which is the easiest way to complete the game.\nYour eye can catch a painting on the wall that leads to a puzzle (some of which can be solved in a bruteforce way, e.g. thinking & clicking unless you find a solution, or by finding more hidden hints in the other parts of the world that sometimes make solving more fun. Oh, you also can open chests to find treasure maps.\n\nThere are special puzzles in purple rooms that give you anticube parts. Some of them include... sound puzzles, which was pretty innovative for me. At least I can't recall a game with a similar idea.\nThere are few really hardcore puzzles (red cubes), one of them requires knowledge of conversion between numeral systems and basic computer science skills. It sticked in my mind for a long time, and I loved it.\n\nYou should remember that FEZ was created with gamepad in mind, so it's better to use it if you have one.\n\nMy verdict: the kind of game that's made with passion and love. It leaves a strong taste after completing it and I doubt you'll forget it any time after that. Phil, Renaud, Rich - my congradulations. I hope you will reunite.","December 4, 2013","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Whether or not you like pixel graphics, these pixel graphics are spectacular to look at. They give a retro feel to the game, but also seem new and fresh.\nBeautiful music and sound effects. The audio is an important part of the atmosphere of this game, so headphones are highly recommended.\nUnique gameplay. 2D platforming on 3D turning stages.\nForgiving gameplay. Death is not punishing and easy to recover from.\nLarge world map and many cryptic puzzles to solve. Each part of the map has its own style and personality, so exploring is fun and rewarding.\nThe story of the world is mysterious, and discovering the many secrets of this game will entail looking at every detail.\nCons:\nThe game's mystery is centered around very cryptic messages scattered around the world written in a strange ancient language that you have to decode, using clues you can gather from around the world. This is an extremely involving process and may require several scans over already explored areas to gain the neccassary clues and tools, so I can imagine that many people (including myself) have taken a look at the many Fez guides online to get past the very difficult puzzles and find the most hidden items.\nOverall Review:\nFeatured on Indie Game the Movie, this is by far one of the defining and most memorable games of the indie scene. Outside of my usual survival game favorites, Fez is probably my favorite indie game. Fez is definitely for those OCD gamers like myself that need to complete everything 100%, and even when that has been done, there are still many mysterious to be explored about the world of Fez.","April 4, 2015","true","16.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Did I complete it, yes. Why you may ask? Because I loved it, that is the only explanation of this game.\n\nAs for the creator, he is a great guy when it comes to his skill in game making, while at times his habit of being over reactive on insults is quite a downside, causing no FEZ 2, which is quite a disappointment seeing how much more they could put into a game with a simplistic but yet smart main mechanic of the game, just like the museum simulator game that is in the works.\n\nThat puts me to my next point of this game, the mechanics. They as said above, simplistic and yet very smart and can lead to an explosion of ideas and tricks. At times playing this game, I wonder how long it takes just to make 1 segment of the map that fits the mechanics.\n\nThe 2 other parts about this game I want to talk about is the puzzles and the music, lets start with the secrets. Most of the times, translating a made up language on a game to find a puzzle is always aggravating and not even worth it, while at the same time uses it for 1-4 puzzles. This, is not the "most" part. In fact, I had fun righting down the language and the codes as I mimic it and hear that 1 sound which is like when you discover a secret on LoZ, but more intense. As that part makes up for it, the anti-cubes or other objects you find in the secrets are required for objectives on the game, obviously the good ending.  Not to mention, the language decoding is actually used on 75% of the anti-cubes making your studying worth it.\n\nNow for the music, I may sound a bit biased with this one but I enjoy atmospheric music on games. Well... except for spooky ones (I'm looking at you "Scare"). I had noticed at times where the further you explore from the teleportation places, the music starts to make you feel lonely, while stages that are a mystery are like what you expect.\n\nNow for my complaints of this game. I noticed a lot of quick stuttering on the top half of my screen which you get used to quickly (Half-baked Complaint, it could be computer problems). A room in a forest that was rotate locked and you had to turn a totem to rotate which was a feature that was used for only that room (Semi-Major Complaint) and the Clock tower anti cubes are a bit painful since they are affected by time zones and take some time to get the exact time configuration, no one has the patience to wait a week just to get a blue virtual cube now, do they?\n\n\nRating: 9/10\nA great indie puzzle game, worth trying out.","May 6, 2013","true","22.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A world when I was younger, and was into movies. I watched the movie "Indie Game" and enjoyed it a lot. It was a nice story and I truly did feel bad for the developers (whose names I have forgotten) when they failed, and rejoiced when they suceeded. Meatboy wasn't my style. I'm not too into platformers. But FEZ... FEZ was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cool. Unfortunatly, I never actually got to buying the game, so I didn't see what it was actually like. That is, until last thursday. And I played this game, and was blown, absolutely blown away.\n\nThis game. This game is absolutely amazing. As i'm playing, I can see the heart and soul put into making this game. This isn't another Call Of Duty 5076, this is an original, beautiful game. With self composed music and many, many, many, easter eggs to find. I'm surprised that this game is taking me such a long time to 100%. There are so many things to explore, so much originality poured into just one place, that it sometimes is too much to take in at once. I'm sure no games like Call Of Duty or Battlefield have QR code secrets implemented into them. This game has so much to do, I can do nothing else in this review except give it a rating.

And, I will admit that the gold cube puzzles are second rate at best. They seem to utilize the mechanic to make an otherwise flaccid platforming experience a bit more cognitive. Maybe if there were things like time limits or some kind of punishment for poor efficiency, changing perspective too many times, the gold cube puzzles would offer more reward. The puzzles that do not truthfully require the use of the perspective mechanic, baring a select few, which are the anti-cube puzzles, offer the true meat of the game. If one wishes to simply 100% fez then it is as simple as prowling the web and finding the solution. But, if one gives Fez's cryptic puzzles the time and invests time as well in uncovering the basic language of these puzzles, which unfortunately offers no in-game reward besides their use in the future, one will find this game to be a thoroughly rewarding experience.\nFez is a meta-game, is it as well executed as MGS2: NO. MGS2 is a true masterpiece, it is the standard for masterpiece. It is a game that has embedded its secrets into its very mechanics. From stun-locking Olga to speed shooting Fatman it is the definition of a true meta-game that requires the player to bend its rules in order to play it well. Fez is not a masterpiece. Fez 2 could have been if the mechanics and cryptography were coupled in a more integrated manner. But, it is an excellent stab at the idea especially when considering its more laid back thesis of concept.\nFez demands time where as a game such as Shadow of the Colossus, MGS2, Super Meat Boy, SSBM, Demon Souls, Super Metroid, Catherine, Soul Caliber 1&2, and a few others, offer you the chance to give your time by making themselves accessible first and difficult later. An attempt at this is made by Fez in the controller cypher room, where your controller’s buttons are abstracted by teteronomes(?), but the attempt was half-hearted because most players will find themselves solving blue cube puzzles in new game plus, and this only takes the player out of the game. It makes the player feel like he is being called stupid, and to be blunt it is shoddy design and annoying.\nThis is still an excellent game and a fun experience overall. It is a shame that a second one will never come out. THEY were really close to having something special with this idea. If they a found a way to make their cryptic stuff more accessible but just as challenging it would be a true achievement and possibly a seminal title. But, then again I cannot see a way to make to make something cryptic accessible. It seems like a contradiction, and I suppose figuring something like that out would be something great.","December 4, 2014","true","79.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In less than five minutes I'd already been happily surprised by the game and I already knew I was going to be spending the next several evenings exploring its mysteries, puzzles, and odd mythology.

These elements mark your progress throughout the game.\n\nYou make progress partly by getting through platforming segments and then furter on deciphering codes or finding different patterns in the world which lead you to a solution.

Next couple of minutes proved that I was wrong. Of course, this game is a platformer but it also needs a lot of logical thinking and provides a lot of fun.\n\nYou play with a little white-ish creature, Gomez, who jumps and runs through different levels. It seems simple. However, when you get your titular FEZ, you gain an ability to see your world in three dimensions. Imagine a shock if you would suddenly get a possibility to manipulate the 4th dimension. That is a feeling of our 2D friend, when he can rotate himself and see everything from a new perspective. And this is a main concept of this game, to use a manipulation of this quasi-3D world for our advantage. Our hero can get to the places that would not be available otherwise and retrieve cubes (our main objective).\n\nOn our way we face many challenges: some of them will require agility, others are riddles that would engage your brain cells. And that riddles, oh boy, they are not trivial. Getting all the cubes without any walkthrough is a nice accomplishment (I strongly recommend it). And there are also that three red cubes. If you manage to get at least one of them by yourself, you deserve a cookie. A big cookie. A truck full of big cookies. Yet, you don’t have to be scared. Even if any riddle will be too hard for you, you can always leave it for later. A metroid-like map lets you leave one zone, get to the other and return when you get an solution. Moreover, not all riddles can be solved on your first run. When you finish this game once, you unlock game plus, where your protégé gains additional abilities. So, as soon as you get enough cubes to end first game, do it. In second game you will try to get all of them.\n\nSumming everything up, FEZ is a platform game with interesting mechanics and will require some thinking. If you considering getting it, do it. If you have it in your steam library, play it. This game was a wonderful experience to me. Even if you won’t like it as I do, I don’t think you would regret trying.\n","March 16, 2015","true","12.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And then BAM - the world's first cube is born. Each stage of this cute indie number is essentially four 2D screens between which you can quickly rotate. Some aspects of FEZ are a little off-putting which makes it a tough game to really get into.\n\nThe jumping is unusual as there is no air-strafing; once your feet have left the ground, your landing position is already determined. There are no enemies to avoid and stages are based around turning the world around 90° so that you can climb to your goal. If you fall off the bottom of the world, you respawn on the last safe ground you were at. If you fall onto a platform too far below, you also get respawned which I think is excellent, as it means you can continue climbing through the level rather than landing on one of the first platforms and starting over.\n\nThrough the game you collect little cubes and eight (count them) go together to make a big cube, which is your goal. Collecting lots of these unlock doors to other puzzles and there are 71 collectables to find. The problem with this is that at the very start when you don't have many cubes, there may be only two possible cubes that you can find at that stage before opening the next door. If you're having trouble this can be a bit of a turn off, but once you get past the first few doors, you should have no problem getting a good grip on this game. The ending is lovely.\n\nIt is a bit of a risk, but also a safe bet when it comes to sales of FEZ. Sure it's an indie game which is "quite nice", but it's also one of many "quite nice" indie games. Having said that, the Steam community seem to adore them and jump straight in to a pretty looking game. Some people however have avoided FEZ because of the creator Phil Fish's history, but I'll say only this: Sir Isaac Newton was not a nice man by any stretch of the imagination, but we still believe in gravity.","January 29, 2014","true","7.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Lovely graphics and music, and a whole sheaf of worlds crammed full of mind-bending puzzles. The game's unique perspective mechanic was great fun to master, and the game does a pretty good job of integrating the 2D -> 3D paradigm shift into the gameworld: you encounter early civilizations that are exclusively two-dimensional, and subsequent civilizations gradually master the use of three-dimensional construction until they're building fantastic machines that fold the fabric of reality itself. On top of that, the game has its own system of numbers and letters that you can figure out to better understand the world.\n\nUltimately, though, this game disappointed me. The one critical thing it's lacking is a story to give the player's actions meaning. Fez is 100% a game about solving puzzles so you can collect shinies. The reason this is so disappointing is because there's a lot of room in the world for a story to be told. The main character is given a mission by his mentor to explore the universe and go on an adventure; along the way he discovers worlds ancient and modern which are tearing themselves apart due to overuse of space-folding technology. It's like Riven all over again, but it's missing the deep characters who give the mission its urgency and meaning. Once you learn the game's language, you can translate its signs and speech bubbles, but they're full of trivia which do nothing to make you care about what you're doing.\n\nFez has gorgeous pixelated worlds to explore, a lovely soundtrack, and puzzles that range from "easy" to "almost two years later, no-one has solved them yet." For all of that, the game felt hollow to me. But it did make me appreciate the classics a little more.","March 13, 2014","true","8.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

It's the sort of game that will be equally as wonderful as the amount of effort you put into it. To those who are looking for nothing more than a casual experience, wandering around searching for cubes...FEZ has that. To those who wish for an immersive game with detail of unprecedented levels...FEZ has that. What's truly amazing about this title is the ability for each of these audiences to appreciate the game without overlap. That is to say; if you play FEZ with the intentions of a casual gamer, you don't have to worry about confusion or frustration trying to follow a story. Of course, if you immerse yourself in the world, the game opens up far beyond its casual surface.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are wonderfully original and unique. The puzzles one encounters are delightfully tricky and cleverly designed. It is the sort of game that is truly enjoyable to play. Calming, yet challenging.\n\nAdditionally, beating the game has nothing to do with finishing it. Once completing the game once, there is a story plus mode which allows you to continue playing your campaign. What makes this feature truly unique is the addition of a second ending...and if you can believe it...a third. Each ending offering yet another way to experience the game.\n\nTo imagine that all this spawned from the talents of a single individual is breathtaking, and should be enough alone to convince anyone to play this title.

Of one of these puzzles, while a solution has been found by the online community by means of cooperative brute force, it is not even known how exactly someone should have found the answer.

Next couple of minutes proved that I was wrong. Of course, this game is a platformer but it also needs a lot of logical thinking and provides a lot of fun.\n\nYou play with a little white-ish creature, Gomez, who jumps and runs through different levels. It seems simple. However, when you get your titular FEZ, you gain an ability to see your world in three dimensions. Imagine a shock if you would suddenly get a possibility to manipulate the 4th dimension. That is a feeling of our 2D friend, when he can rotate himself and see everything from a new perspective. And this is a main concept of this game, to use a manipulation of this quasi-3D world for our advantage. Our hero can get to the places that would not be available otherwise and retrieve cubes (our main objective).\n\nOn our way we face many challenges: some of them will require agility, others are riddles that would engage your brain cells. And that riddles, oh boy, they are not trivial. Getting all the cubes without any walkthrough is a nice accomplishment (I strongly recommend it). And there are also that three red cubes. If you manage to get at least one of them by yourself, you deserve a cookie. A big cookie. A truck full of big cookies. Yet, you don’t have to be scared. Even if any riddle will be too hard for you, you can always leave it for later. A metroid-like map lets you leave one zone, get to the other and return when you get an solution. Moreover, not all riddles can be solved on your first run. When you finish this game once, you unlock game plus, where your protégé gains additional abilities. So, as soon as you get enough cubes to end first game, do it. In second game you will try to get all of them.\n\nSumming everything up, FEZ is a platform game with interesting mechanics and will require some thinking. If you considering getting it, do it.

It's mostly a 2d puzzle platform game with some aspects of 3d thrown in there for extra layers. If you like puzzle platform games and have a few hours of time to spend, then FEZ is a good choice for you. The game and most of it's simpler puzzles can be solved in about 3-6 hours and adds a few more complex puzzles for those that were really captivated by the game and needs to know everything. It can become a bit messy at times and you will be leaning your head a lot, luckily for those out there with neck problems there are plenty of guides that can guide you though from start to finish.","March 8, 2014","true","16.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's the sort of game that will be equally as wonderful as the amount of effort you put into it. To those who are looking for nothing more than a casual experience, wandering around searching for cubes...FEZ has that. To those who wish for an immersive game with detail of unprecedented levels...FEZ has that. What's truly amazing about this title is the ability for each of these audiences to appreciate the game without overlap. That is to say; if you play FEZ with the intentions of a casual gamer, you don't have to worry about confusion or frustration trying to follow a story. Of course, if you immerse yourself in the world, the game opens up far beyond its casual surface.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are wonderfully original and unique. The puzzles one encounters are delightfully tricky and cleverly designed. It is the sort of game that is truly enjoyable to play. Calming, yet challenging.\n\nAdditionally, beating the game has nothing to do with finishing it. Once completing the game once, there is a story plus mode which allows you to continue playing your campaign. What makes this feature truly unique is the addition of a second ending...and if you can believe it...a third. Each ending offering yet another way to experience the game.\n\nTo imagine that all this spawned from the talents of a single individual is breathtaking, and should be enough alone to convince anyone to play this title. Coupled with the immersive universe, enjoyable gameplay, and clever mechanics, this becomes a game that is impossible to pass up.\n\nFive Stars.","June 11, 2014","true","5.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You can't have any challenge with that!). What I ended up finding is a puzzle game, and a pretty unique one.\n\nRather than having a set of rooms that you solve through using the quirky 3D mechanic, it's actually about exploring the world, gathering clues to understand how the various artifacts you find work. Somewhat similar to an in-game ARG that you can solve yourself.\n\nSome puzzles can get complicated and the game sometimes expects you to make some pretty long leaps in logic. But once you figure it out after thinking about it for a while, you feel very clever and it can also bring light to another mystery elsewhere in the world that was getting you stumped earlier, which is quite rewarding and makes you want to go check it out immediately.\n\nThe ambiance is also a big part of the game, with it's pleasing atmospheric soundtrack and the wildly varying environments that you discover. This reinforces the whole "exploring the world" aspect of the game, and is very successful. You can also go look for deeper meanings to the implied events that happen in the game. I personally was very content just looking for puzzles and smelling the roses, but it's certainly there for people who like it, and it adds to the overall mysterious ambiance.\n\nIn the end, I was pleasantly surprised, and quickly found myself caught in the mystery-solving, ending up with a few pages of scribbles and a lot of screenshots taken as notes. If you like investing yourself into ARG-like puzzles you'll certainly get caught like me.\n\nNow I feel sorta bummed out for Fez 2.","February 3, 2014","true","12.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","4"

It's about discovery, relief, have a breath of fresh air and then exhale it on the sunset. It isn't about a challenge, or fighting against a greater evil, It is walking somewhere you have never been before, and feel relaxed about it. Atmospherical, and I love atmospheric games. That's why the music selected is peaceful, minimalistic ambient that fits to the setting of the levels, or why you can hear the sound of waves, seagulls or your footsteps in the game. Yeah, you have to collect items to progress, but the game's best selling point is how easily you can be drown into it with the idea of knowing that there is excitement for something new around the corner. There is also great use of colours in this game that is really well done that deserves some credit. Like Silent Hill 2 and Lone Survivor, I suggest to play this game at night, without lights, and with the certainty that NOBODY will interrupt you. Good game, one of the developers is little bit mean though. A little.

Sometimes simple and easy, sometimes really hard (looking at you, rising lava level) but always fun. The "3D" shifting mechanism works really well and makes the game feel really unique and original. On top of that is a cool map of locations, each filled with either NPCs, collectables, puzzles or just platforms. It is hard to pinpoint what I like about this game so much but I guess it could be the way it lets you progress. While the floating cube gives you vague hints it is YOU who tries out which path to go. The only thing about the game logic that I disliked was the cryptic language and a couple of puzzles that were a bit too hard in the way that I had no idea what the game wanted from me. So, yes, I helped myself with a guide after collecting all that I could (which was most of the stuff). However other puzzles like vibrating controller hints were really cool and I loved them. The pixelated graphics are a nice touch, they fit the game really well too. Overall I can see the tremendous amount of time spent on making this game, it is AWESOME! So awesome that I am purchasing another copy (maybe via GoG) to support the developers. Result?

I thought based on the art that I was getting into a simple platformer. Fez is more than that. It is puzzle game. It is Carl Sagan's "flatland" brought to life. Using the 2nd and 3rd dimensions, Fez will make you realize how thoroughly confused and magical a 4th dimensional being would be.\n\nThe pace is perfect for casual gaming. So far, there is nothing that has prevented me from just looking away from the screen at almost any moment if needed. Twitch skills aren't really needed, which I appreciate every now and then. If the last game you played was Super Mario Brothers, you might actually be comfortable with this... eventually.\n\nI have found navigating the world, which is VERY large, somewhat confusing. I have been successful in progressing despite this, but as a 100% completion nut, some of the puzzles and travelling back and forth have been frustrating. I still don't quite get how to determine where the portals will take me.\n\nWith both solid Linux support and full controller support, this was as much a joy to play on my PC as it was my TV-connected HTPC with XBox controller.

Can't really recommend you to buy it since Phil FIsh would get money though. But you should totally play it.

It's pretty well designed that way, some of the cryptography puzzles will really make you think or maybe pull your hairs out, depends on your pacience...\n\nThe art style is somewhat simple, but persoanlly i loved it, pretty colourful and cheery most of the time, but does a good job of giving you a sense of dread and fear in some areas, though the soundtracks helps quite a lot too.\n\nIt's somewhat short, but pretty enjoyable experience.

The twist is that the game world exists in a state of quasi-3D. Like most 2D games, FEZ presents us with an orthographic projection of a 2D world. Where it turns expectations on its head is that you can use the orthographic projection to your advantage, rotating the world in 3D to move your character from where they are actually positioned in the level to where they are percieved to be on a hypothetical 3D projection of the world. IT's an effect that has to be seen to be truly understood, but imagine playing an M.C.

The challenge comes from a combination of backtracking to collect previously uncollectable pieces and figuring out how to use your world-rotating powers to collect them. The joy comes from that "Eureka!" moment when you finally figure out the right combination of climbs, hops and rotations to get you to your goal. FEZ provides these moments in spades and the puzzles never seem overly obtuse or unfair.

Sure you would still be able to appreciate the adorable, vibrant graphics and great soundtrack, but you probably wouldn't have taken the time to think through the complex puzzles that reveal a whole bunch of secrets, such as certain hidden in-game codes to unlock collectibles, or even an entire cube language. Or for the completionists, found every cube, some of which are extremely well hidden I might add. However these can all be bypassed if you don't want to bother with the more difficult puzzles, and can enjoy the main game at your own leisure.\n\nWhat I also found interesting is that you are not given much of a story-related background at all, instead you're left to piece together what might have happened in the past from only pictures similar to cave drawings on walls you find throughout the game. I think apart from finding all the collectibles, hypothesising how the world of Fez came to be was the most enjoyable thing to do.\n\nI was very pleasantly surprised when it unexpectedly broke the fourth-wall at times too, but what else would you expect from a game that despite being built around cubes, thinks very much outside the box?","December 29, 2013","true","12.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

He lives in his ordinary house in his ordinary village. One morning you wakeup and recieve mail from an old man. You climb through the village learning the basics of the controls and confront the old man. This is when everything happens. A giant cube appears out of nowhere, teleporting you to some alternate plane. The plane begins to spin around. Suddenly, Gomez realizes that this is not in fact a 2-D world, but a 3-D world. The cube bestows a gift to Gomez, a fez hat that allows Gomez to change his viewpoint at will. Then suddenly, there is an error with the cube and it shatters. The PC Gomez is living in resets. Gomez wakes up in his house again when he is greeted by a little giltch. This glitch tells Gomez of his quest, to find all of the missing cubes to fix the computer.\n\nThis game has a lot of puzzles in it. If you are frustrated easily be warned this game is not for you. It took me about 15 hours to complete the game 100%, some of it was offline working on puzzles. This is the only game that I have ever had to use a notebook for to keep track of where all of the hidden gems are and the secret codes.\n\nThere are two different endings to the game. The first one, you only have 32-63 cubes. This is a very trippy ending. After this ending, you recieve an object that makes it possible to find the remaining cubes. The second ending is not trippy, and is a much more fullfilling ending. After the second ending, you recieve another item that allows you to play the game in 3-D if you have some of the old type of 3-D glasses (red/blue).\n\nIf you intend to play this game for a bit here and there, I suggest either using a guide for the game, or using a notebook, that way you can keep track of things, especially if you take a long break between starting and finishing the game.\n\nOverall, this is a good game. The plot is linear, why the world is branching. The music is phenomenal. It's very calming to play through this game and didn't cause me a lot of stress, but I don't mind solving puzzles. I have a lower end laptop and this game ran very smoothly on, with almost no loading time between maps and very high framerate.

The game is not challenging at all in a traditional sense, which can be a drawback in the first moments of gameplay. Once this is accepted, the game unfolds its true value to the player.\n\nIts immensity can only be enjoyed when you understand that the game is not the "average 3 life available with no continues" challenge, and subsequently gives a spin to the traditional gimmick of platforming video games with its huge world, 2.5D over four-dimension gameplay, and some small but rewarding puzzles you have to discover on your own to advance. It has some difficulty poured in these puzzles, and they are the most difficult thing to do in the game (along with having to locate parts of the overworld that may have pieces or treasure chests left to pick up. the UI helps in sorting the rooms in a very effective way).\n\nP.S: the game can also be run in 4:3 with no problem if you enter in %appdata%, edit the Settings file in the FEZ directory and enter your desired resolution. I recommend 1024x768 as it's the most effective one available that will allow you to see all the game's contents without letterboxing (the next one is 1280x1024 and in this, 720p fits, which results in said letterboxing). I find this game more enjoyable to play in a CRT television. I'm a weirdo.\n\nSo in short, if you can only think of games as subsequent challenges, forget about this. If you want a refreshing spin on this genre, try it. This is what we were expecting of indie games anyways, right?","December 12, 2013","true","8.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Can't really recommend you to buy it since Phil FIsh would get money though. But you should totally play it. Maybe from a bundle.\n\nThe plataforming is pretty easy (the concept of changing dimensions is fun and imaginative though), and finishing the game doesn't take any real skill, but some puzzles take some thinking, especially the ones to find some of the extra stuff like anti-cubes or artifacts. It's pretty well designed that way, some of the cryptography puzzles will really make you think or maybe pull your hairs out, depends on your pacience...\n\nThe art style is somewhat simple, but persoanlly i loved it, pretty colourful and cheery most of the time, but does a good job of giving you a sense of dread and fear in some areas, though the soundtracks helps quite a lot too.\n\nIt's somewhat short, but pretty enjoyable experience.

Supports keyboard and controller equally well, though controller can only be remapped in the config files. Displays or multiple wider than 16:9 work very well with UI placement that's a touch off, but anything slimmer (16:9, 4:3) get's letterboxed to 16:9. It is technically a 3D game, but it's very minimal so there are no performance problems other than that V-sync is forced on. It's capped at 60FPS, however using a basic launch command ("--force-120hz"), you can force it to run at double speed. Usually this completely breaks games, but it actually seems to have no effect on music or sound effects, and actually makes the game feel far more responsive as the movement was extremely slow to begin with. As a warning, I've only tested portions of the game with this, not the whole thing, so it's possible it could cause an issue somewhere or make the one timed platforming section near the end of the game too difficult. Anyone feel free to let me know the results if you play the whole game at 2x.\n\nGameplay\nThere was far more depth than I previously imagined. Sure, the platforming is simple and very rarely requires much skill, but the puzzles, atmosphere, and sense of discovery are amazing. There are so many little things to discover, and without the use of a guide it really requires some intense thought and a pen and paper to keep track of things. When you think you are done with the game, you are probably only half done, but you'll need to open a guide or really work hard at it to truly discover it all. I completed every single thing the game had to offer, a 6-8 hour experience overall.\n\nPresentation\nThe art style is basically perfect, and it really does have a style all it's own. You can see a slight similarity to cave story, but other then that it's unique. And even though it's simple, there is so much charm, and you just smile at the various creatures prancing around the levels. The soundtrack is amazing and while I've never found it quite engaging enough to listen to on it's own, it absolutely suits the game and adds a lot to the experience.\n\nTLDR - Summary\nThe platforming is basic, but the overall atmosphere, puzzle design, and raw curiosity that it draws out of you is wonderful. Playing at 2x speed @ 120FPS adds a lot of responsiveness and makes the visuals even more appealing. While I can't fully vouch for that experience without playing the entire game again, it's worth a shot. Regardless, this is absolutely a charming little game that you'll never forget if you really dig into it. Qualms about the actions of the developer aside, you really shouldn't pass this one up.","May 11, 2014","true","8.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

(refer to trailer for visualization)\n+ This engine is extremely polished and responsive. It doesn't take very long to figure out the different applications is has in each environment.\n- In order to "100%" the game, you must solve various puzzles. Be it through hidden messages, or maneuvering blocks into a specific formation. A lot of these puzzles are extremely cryptic and require a lot of patience. Some of which require scanning "QR" codes, which may sound interesting, but for people like me who can't scan these codes it is completely irrelevant.\n\nSoundtrack: 10/10\n+ Beautifully crafted chiptune/synth melodies.\n(Best enjoyed late at night, with good speakers/headphones)\n* Composed by Disasterpeace! :D\n~ Pick up this soundtrack, it is a master"peace" (hehe..... heh.....)\n\nArtstyle & Impression: 10/10\n+ This game is beautiful!

Some because they consider the gameplay repetitive, others because of the developer, Phil Fish, insulting PCs and Japanese games, also quitting the gaming industry and stopping production on FEZ 2. I'm not big on Phil Fish, because of just about everything I listed. However, just because he is a jerk, that does not mean that this game is bad. I'll try and review this as best as I can.\n\nFEZ is a 2D and 3D platformer. The main character, Gomez, gets a magical fez hat that gives him to see the third demention, and travel to other places he never even knew existed. The gameplay to this game is just like every other platformer, except the fact that you can switch sides of the world to make traveling easier, since Gomez isn't some supersoldier armed with giant machine guns while wearing shades or anything like that. If the gameplay had some more unique things to add on to that besides the 3D world thing, then I would have given this game a much higher rating. Please do note, however, that there is NO, ABSOLUTELY NO COMBAT IN THIS GAME WHATSOEVER. One other thing I must point out, and this is a downside, is that FEZ is very, very buggy. I had trouble exploring some worlds because of the bugs I found.\n\nThe world of FEZ is probably the best part to the game- with it's stunning environments that look even more beautiful with the 3D effect, and I love every bit of it. Even the animations for the creatures in the world (Excluding Gomez, who I think is just mediocre) look beautiful and well done. You'll fall in love with the worlds, just trust me.\n\nThe story, well, there isn't much of a story in this game. If you really want to find some info, you should just buy this game and then find out from there.\n\nThe characters are the same way, other than the villagers in Gomez's town, I didn't find many other characters besides you and that ANNOYING crystal thing who somewhat strikes a resemblance to Navi, from Zelda: Ocarina of Time.\n\nThe soundtrack for FEZ is amazing. It's soothing, calm, and peaceful. I enjoy the soundtrack for this game. It isn't the greatest, which I believe Faster Than Light holds that spot, but I do love it. When you pair it up with the world of this game, it was pieced together perfectly.\n\nI'd say that's about all I can say for this game. Even though I have yet to finish the storyline, I am enjoying the game so far. I'll probably make a revised version of this game once I complete it. It's a very good game, and I recommend it if you don't mind not fighting anything.\n\nGraphics- 9.5/10\nGameplay- 6.5/10\nStory- 5/10\nAudio- 9.5/10\nReplayability- 7/10\n\n.:8.3/10:.\n+Lovely worlds\n+Beautiful soundtrack\n+Unique twist to 2D platformers\n+Calming (Especially after you play Super Meat Boy, some might disagree)\n-Buggy\n-Nothing really new to it besides the 3D worlds\n-Annoying follower (Forgot to mention- I even nicknamed him Navi 2.0)","May 1, 2014","true","2.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

It's a bit tedious compared to other platformers, but has lots of atmosphere and mystery to make up for it.\nIts main mechanic is rotation. The world is a three-dimensional space "flattened" into whatever side you're looking at, and to progress you can turn it around.\nThe platforming is fairly trite - the level design uses that rotation system very cleverly, but there's lots of waiting for the slow protagonist to walk somewhere. And surviving a fall makes you lose more progress than dying, which is very annoying.\nOn the other hand, the game world is lovingly designed. The relaxing, beautiful and mysterious atmosphere will make you smile and the dragged-out platforming actually helps you take in the details.\n\nThe world is filled with mysteries and cryptography puzzles, which are optional and vague but very satisfying to solve.\n\nI recommend this game for its beautiful ambience and strange puzzles that may please fans of games like La-Mulana and Antichamber.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/224760/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","Fez is a very simple 2D-rotating platforming game. Your character has no real personality and the game has no real plotline; the game is wholly reliant upon its very minimalist presentation and the platforming you do.\n\nStory\n\nFez has no real story to speak of. The world of Fez is never really explained to the player, and the only truly notable features it has are a handful of subsititution ciphers - an alphabet, a numbering system, and a system that tells you to press certain button combinations to find secrets. All three of them must be deciphered by the player, but ultimately only the numbering system is all that difficult to decipher. The alphabetic system is rather sneakily presented, but once you realize what you're doing, it is obvious what is going on.\nSadly none of these things make the world especially interesting, and once you've figured out what the symbols mean it is mostly just tedious work deciphering writing around the world. The actual writing isn't very deep or interesting, and the game itself doesn't really do anything interesting with its world despite its seeming mysteriousness.\n\nGameplay\n\nFez is a very simple game. You can move around, jump (once), open treasure chests and doors, pick up crates, and rotate the world. Most of that is bog standard; its one "unique" mechanic is the world rotation. While Fez appears to be a 2D world, in reality it is a very odd combination of 2D and 3D. You play the game walking around in two dimensions, so the third dimension does not matter so long as you are walking around, but when you rotate the world, you are placed on some point in the 3D plane (always on a platform if you are on one, though) and the world is rotated around, creating a new 2D plane to play on. As you can only rotate the world 90 degrees at a time, this generates four "maps" per area. You navigate the world by rotating it around and jumping from platform to platform in various planes. There are some bits of interactive terrain which will spin you around or launch you, and some terrain YOU can manipulate yourself, but overall the game is quite simple, though there are some somewhat clever puzzles you can solve by rotating.\nUnfortunately the game is a one-trick pony; the rotation is the only real mechanic the game has. While there are a few "puzzles" of sorts, they are basically all "figure out what the writing system says, then follow the instructions". There are four or five puzzles you solve via maps that you collect, but most of these are not terribly difficult to solve either - the main issue is figuring out that you have all the maps necessary to solve a particular puzzle. Most of them are very simple, and the few that aren't are incredibly obtuse - two of the red cube puzzles in particular are just absurd, with one of them relying on you noticing the flashing of stars in the background.\nThe game itself is basically about collecting 64 cubes - 32 light cubes and 32 dark cubes, though there is little difference between them. The light cubes are mostly in the form of 8 smaller cube chunks, which you assemble into a larger cube, but some light cubes are simply found as whole cubes. Once you complete them all, you're done with the game.\nOverall the game takes about 12 hours to complete, which involves some amount of backtracking, though overall it mostly isn't overly excessive.\n\nGraphics\n\nFez has retro pixel graphics, and isn't very pretty to look at. The only really interesting thing about it is a few points at which the interface is played with - the game pretends to glitch out and "restart" your computer, which is actually an in-game computer with a few hidden little jokes that if you blink, you'll miss them. The ending cinematics are alright, but nothing special. Overall the graphics are functional, and it is easy to tell what you are doing, but the game is far from pretty.\n\nFinal Summary\n\nFez has a cute central mechanic and is not overly long, but it feels like there isn't any real meat to the game. While the world appears mysterious and interesting at first blush, as you go further into the game you realize that it is less "mystery" and more "only barely present at all." There is no storyline to speak of, the central mechanic is interesting but nothing to write home about, and after a while the game begins to feel slightly repetitive even though it is very short simply because there is no real substance to it.\n","December 3, 2014","false","12.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

Perhaps you are merely looking to consolidate your opinion and no money has been spent at all. If that's the case, then let it be known that this is a game which you would be wise to purchase. Through a series of luck and love, our lord and saviour Phil Fish, has seen fit to bless us with a creation that will end all creations. You see this is Fez, a video-game unlike any other.\n\nHush the applause please people for I do not deserve it yet. On this perch I stand today in order to describe for you this piece of aesthetic bliss, so that one day your lives will be as blessed as my own.\n\nI do this not out of narcissism but out of virtue for the lesser amongst you who have yet to experience this product. For you see, as Dionysus would explain himself if he were alive today, Fez is not so much a game but a way of life; it is a philosophy to live by. It merges the boundaries of puzzles and platforms, becoming  an inter-connected adventure across the two-dimensional plains where you must retrieve the hidden, mysterious, and darn-right fabled puzzle pieces.\n\nFor you see a shift unlike any other has occured and it is up to Gomez, and by extension yourself, to save the world from vice. Just as Achilles set out to battle for the glory of Ancient Greece in Homer's Iliad, Gomez must traverse into the wild to save his world from destruction.\n\nBut as Achilles had his Helen to serve as a motivating factor, Gomez has only his spirit, neigh his unrelenting will, to guide him. It is for this reason among others why we can look upon Gomez as not merely a kind-of cartoonish rabbit-thing but as an allegory for the struggle of humanity to overcome persecution throughout history. He embodies the determined movement towards divinity; towards the blinding light for which we all shall receive our due rewards in Elysium.\n\nI ask of you what other games can we look upon as revealing and illuminating such depth? Only Halo bears the familiarity of which I speak, and it is a game which pales in comparison to the likes of Fez.\n\nOf course, there is one thing I fear the most and it is that I shall not have convinced the most stubborn of you to take a chance upon this title. For this I do not judge. It is without sin that I caste the first stone, but I beg of you that you will come to see the truth beyond all things in time.\n\nI ask patience to reign over you and the almighty to seek fit to bless you with the spirit of reason.

Not too long, not to short, and it highly benifits from the amount of hidden features and time loops. There are many refrences to old games, what with this being a retro game, like TETRIS constellations, and an annoying little floaty thing that will make you want it to just go (it is useful at times though). There ar little to no supporting characters, but the silence makes it eerie at times, and the level designs are spectacular. Sure the designer of the game isn't the friendliest guy on earth, but a lot of people would say the same if they really knew other game developers. The new take on 2D platforming is a breath of fresh air when stressed, and if you like old NES or ATARI or even SEGA GENISIS games, I'd buy this game.

Albeit the platforming is rather simple, the new gameplay elements it introduces are simple yet so innovative - it's incredible how underrated it is. It is a pretty complicated game, I couldn't finish most of the puzzles without the guide (and I'm rarely one to submit that easily); the world is so gigantic you'll need a little while to get your bearing and you'd better be organized before you start to go into every open door you see. So if you're into for some serious puzzling, relaxing gameplay, exploring a vast and queer world, this game's worth your time.\n\nTo keep it short, loved the game, very refreshing to play something that's this different in basically everything: visuals, music,  mechanics - the way the game feels was like no other I've played before.

Not because it's a bad game or not worth the price – both couldn't be further from the truth – but because I feel that its developer should have gotten a bigger cut of my disposable income. (Throwing money at the screen would be rather appropriate, if it did actually work.)\n\nAs a study of dimensionality, it succeeds at conveying the feelings one would likely experience upon finding out that the world is not only different from one's own concept, but hardly comprehensible even when catching a glimpse of its true nature. (Think H. P. Lovecraft, but in rainbow colours.) As a piece of pop culture, it's bound to expand the horizons of, and thoroughly surprise. most of its players. As "just a puzzle platformer", it both exploits and lampshades the inherent inability to think in higher dimensions than one has been used to since basically forever, while consistently being interesting, challenging and simply very well crafted. If I had to name a failing with FEZ, it would be the rather artificial inflation of post-endgame content, and thus game length for completionists, with more or less identically working puzzles.\n\nEvery time FEZ comes up as a Daily Deal or Flash Sale, I become excited and remorseful at the same time, because it's, in my opinion, one of the decade's defining videogames, and a ridiculous steal even at full price. Never mind that its designer seems to take himself way too seriously.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/224760/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","2D is a special little dimension. Forgoing that pesky thing known as depth, it's a world wholly unlike that which we see and live in everyday; an otherworldly place where being flat isn't a negative, but a wondrous and unique expression of the universe. The residents of Fez know this better than most, being a group in and in love with the 2D space they inhabit. But what if this world isn't as flat as they believe? What if there is an entire other dimension right beneath the surface? What if all it took to discover it, was for a tiny little guy named Gomez to put on a Fez?\n\nFor as troubled as its development may have been, none of those hardships have shown through now that Fez is finally here. While I could try to avoid hyperbole, it's hard for me to talk about my time with Gomez without spouting an abundance of praise with the look of a child telling you about his favorite toy on my face. Its a heartwarming and beautiful experience; a masterwork of merging traditional and unorthodox game design into something enrapturing.\n\nTo reiterate what I mentioned before, Fez is a 2D game taking place in a 3D world. Every area in the game is fully modeled in three dimensions, but you can only ever see one side of it at a time. Combating this is your one and only power: that to rotate the world around you, revealing a new side to what once looked to be nothing but a flat wall. Although the idea of never gaining any new mechanics or your character otherwise progressing and growing stronger might sound limiting and repetitive, this is as much a journey of your own discovery and growth as it is Gomez's.\n\nThe reason for this is that Fez is clever. Brilliantly and confoundingly clever, to the point I'm not sure if I should praise Phil Fish for his ingenuity, or curse him for making his game too smart for me. Although progressing through the world may at first seem a simple enough task, it's not until late into the game that you begin to truly understand the finer points of how to utilize perspective to get where you need to go.\n\nThe only thing standing between you and getting through the game is you, creating a fantastically nonlinear progression that requires backtracking not because you were previously halted by an arbitrary obstacle, but because you now understand how the various parts of the world fit together in ways that otherwise never would have occurred to you. It's a wonderfully rewarding style of play that's rarely seen in games that makes you feel intelligent in ways only video games can.\n\nThere is a bit of a double-edged sword to all of this however, that being Fez sometimes doesn't know when it's being TOO clever for its own good, pushing past reason into the obtuse. I could blame a lot of this on my being dumb, but certain puzzles are simply so abstract and unexplained that using a guide almost feels mandatory if you want to see everything Fez has to offer. To be entirely fair much of this is in the form of extra areas and secrets which you aren't required to solve to complete the game, but it's a tad frustrating that so many of the most interesting parts are also the most confusing, leaving those disinclined to scour the internet to likely set the game down when there is still much to find.\n\nBut even then, I can hardly knock Fez for this given how much I adore everything else. It's a wonderful game that makes me feel like I'm rediscovering games for the first time. I don't even know how to best describe the sort of magic it creates, as any attempt fails to encompass the broad warmth and imagination it embodies. The pixel art is remarkable, full of so much charm and life that I couldn't help but feel a part of it as I got sucked in for hours on end.\n\nThere are no words for how amazing and fitting the soundtrack (composed by the ever so talented Rich Vreeland AKA Disasterpeace) is, easily one of the most dynamic and original that I have heard in years, and an example of how a game's music can so perfectly complement its gameplay. Everything shines with the sort of passion you only see in indie projects, and I am so very happy that it found its release and I was able to take part in it myself.\n\nThank you Phil Fish, it was quite the adventure.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","April 14, 2014","true","12.1"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","2"

Coupled with a surreal mixture of harmonic and midi style sound effects and music.... oh so fitting for the style of game we are looking at here....\nWithout putting too fine a point on it, this is probably the single best platformer that it has been my pleasure to play in many years.\nIf you haven't got this then why the hell not !!!

Then the character gets a hat!  Now, all bets are off and the world can be seen in three dimensions.  The game can take 10 hours or 1000+ plus hours depending how much time a person wants to sink into it.  Most solutions are on google, some puzzles took the community of Fez working together over a year to solve.  There are still unsolved puzzles even today within the game, even the soundtrack contains strange images, most of which noone knows what they mean.  There is a whole different language and counting system in Fez along with a stone teaching you how to move to solve other puzzles, memorize that or use google.  Even with google the game is fun, often times using google ruins a puzzle game, but doesnt feel that way in Fez due to the community working on solutions to leftover puzzles.  One of which right from the start of the game with a Zelda poster in your bedroom, to collecting heart pieces then they shatter into a buncha pieces, and noone knows where the pieces went.  Solving the puzzle could be like hellraiser since its all about a box, so careful what you wish for, Fez may tear your soul apart!\n\nRating:  10/10  Value:  $9.99","July 4, 2014","true","14.2"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","15","29","0","1"

This is the most beautiful, creative, inspiring, mind-blowing gaming experience I ever had with a game that was meant to be one of those titels you play "in between"!\nYou can look at it as a plattformer/puzzle-game but that just tells you the obvious as if one would say "at the moment I'm in front of my PC screen!"\n\nYou can just enjoy the game and it's puzzles, and surely reach the end, having had a good time with plenty of fun! But - if you take a second look at the surroundings, the lovingly architected characters, places and little things, waiting to be explored, you can't help but feel that there is yet more to all of this than meets the eye! You will find that nothing (literally: NOTHING) was place by coincidence, there's no such thing as "by sheer chance"! First, you may think that the "dialouges" are nothing but symbols neatly arranged. But can you fight the feeling that there is more to this?\nIn other words: if you are looking for a game that can take you to another level (both game-wise and mentallly spoken)  and leave you with a REAL experience - here it is!\n\nIf you've ever wondered if there's a hidden world within games, you just found the game that will give you proof!\n\nAs for the puzzles: they reach from "ezee as hell" to "challenging and f*+++*g difficult", but IMHO never unfair! The soundtrack is somewhat awesome though never gaining too much attention!\n\nGet it - you won't regret it, I promise!","October 29, 2014","true","29.1"," 23 of 45 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","23","45","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/both/recommended/224760/","both","%3F","http://steamcommunity.com/id/both/","218 products in account","Some of the most romanticised events of history are those of great explorers and their struggle against unforeseen difficulty: searing heat, freezing cold, malaria and navigation over great seas and jungles in search of unknown knowledge and treasure.\n\nIn Fez, it is revealed to you, as a two-dimensional creature that your reality actually has three dimensions, each with two-dimensional creatures living unbeknownst to each other. The ability is granted by the namesake fez which he wears at all times after the opening sequence. Perspective based platforming is well-explored, but Fez still comes over as fresh and charming, with its extensive and beautiful 3D pixel art on all sides.\n\nAs the owner of the fez, you are charged with assembling cubes from pieces scattered across the dimensions in order to repair the universe. The game truly is expansive, with many unique art styles across the many sectors and subsectors, each forming a minimum of 4 separate 2D platform sections as you rotate the camera in 3D.\n\nI was disappointed in Fez. I feel like the game could have been so much more, but it is also clear that the creators had a very different vision to what I would have hoped. Fez is about exploring, and that is all it is about, there are no enemies, or bosses or quests or miniquests or upgrades or pickups, or shops or anyone to talk to. The game is an endless search for cubes, and though one or two new mechanics are introduced in this search, they all felt tedious and simple, including: The lever which you have to rotate your camera in 3D to turn every time you want to use it, the platforms in that one hub world that rotate irritatingly in 3D, forcing you to rotate the camera as they rotate or jump like you’re trying to defeat Air Man’s vanishing bricks; and the most common ‘puzzle’ in secrets, look up and translate the alien symbols into English (which, by the way also describe the Xbox 360 controls and not the PC controls, so you always have to look them up).\n\nIf the creators’ intention was to question the reason you were searching for cubes at all, they did a very good job in heavily instilling that feeling in me. At the beginning I made an exhaustive search for cubes in each area, making sure to find every last one, assuming that somehow by collecting these I would be in a better position in the other worlds. But the cubes only unlock more worlds, where you can collect more cubes but for what?\n\nTravelling between worlds is a tedious and irritating process, as there is no ‘fast travel’ in the game. If you, like I did, exhaust the world of cubes before you left, you must move through these empty worlds, solving all the puzzles you did before, backwards to get back to where you were so that you can explore the game’s branching paths. These worlds are extremely extensive and still require extensive precision jumping, rotating and thinking just to get through them. Some 'hub worlds' have portals, but you still have to reach them from whatever backwater dimension you were in.\n\nThe best comparison to another game I can make is The Machine (youtu.be/69zK_L5ADTo ) from Knytt stories, which also involves lots of platforming, lots and lots of exploring, branching paths, no fast travel, few enemies and very little talk. But, in contrast, I loved The Machine. I loved it for its breathtaking atmosphere and wonderful sound design, excellent platforming and interesting puzzle sections involving carefully using new-found platforming abilities. In contrast, I often found Fez wearing- I never came to love the art, the sound was painful at times, the platforming always seemed very slow, monotonous and a little too forgiving; and the worlds seemed just so void of any kind of life.\n\nOverall, Fez is a good game. It is fun, it’s pretty well-polished, but it constantly feels like you’re searching for someone’s keys they left all around the house under random objects.\n\nIn the future, my reviews will probably all be yes, unless the game is really awful. Opinion is never a boolean thing.","November 26, 2013","true","5.8"," 24 of 47 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","24","47","0","2"

Here is why:\n\nFEZ starts with a somehow refreshing and appealing concept. The pixel art is great (one of the best I have seen so far) and the basic concept of the game (rotating a 2D world) is pretty interesting.\n\nHowever, once the first impression faded out and I started exploring through more and more levels, I found myself before a pretty repetitive game that did not really find a way to use its gameplay to its full potential.\nI understand that the core concept of FEZ lies around the puzzles. Some of them are great, while I found the majority to be a pretty dull reuse of the same key you found at some point in the game (I will not go further since I don't want to spoil the game for anyone willing to try it).\n\nThe platformer part is one of the biggest drawback of the game. The controls are sloppy and the rare parts where you need to precisely control your jumps can be a real pain in the ***.\n\nThe musics are ok I guess. And while they do not really match with the graphical aspect of the maps, they are discrete enough not to become annoying.\n\nAll in all, I found FEZ to be a cool concept with a pretty bad realization , wrapped inside an average puzzle game. I really tried to like this game, given all the hype that came around it. Pretty much a forgettable experience IMHO.","May 28, 2015","false","5.5"," 34 of 67 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","34","67","0","0"

If you enjoy puzzles and have never seen any videos on this game, I would recommend picking it up. However, if you're one of those people who look up solutions to puzzles, or you've watched a playthrough before, I'd suggest you pass on it as it would be a waste. I watched a playthrough before, and because of that I knew many of the secrets way before I was meant to figure them out. I completed the entire game, including all of the secrets, in less than a day (I had to change my computer's clock, otherwise it would've taken me 2-3 days, YES there's a secret that makes you wait several irl days to complete). It was a fun game and I enjoy playing it, I just believe with my knowledge of the game before-hand, the $10 was wasted, it ruined the entire aspect of discovery because I knew how everything worked the instant I got to it.\nBut like I said, if you have never seen anything about this game, and you love puzzles and discoveries and want to be dedicated enough to figure out everything on your own without looking up a guide, YOU WILL LOVE THIS GAME. It has everything, puzzles, secrets, even it's own language! And they aren't the kind of secrets you have to look up (well, except the red heart puzzles, but those have no impact on the game, they're mainly for completionists who want an extreme puzzle challenge), everything you need to know to discover a secret is right there in the game, somewhere, and once you find it you figure out how to solve the puzzles that stumped you before, then you want to run around to areas with unsolved puzzles and complete them (oh and btw, the world map shows you when an area has been completed, so it's easy to tell when you still have a secret).\n\ntl;dr: If you've watched a let's play or any tutorials on this game, or you like to look up guides to complete puzzles, this isn't the game for you and it would be a waste of money. But if you enjoy puzzles and love a challenge, and are blind to the game, I highly highly recommend it.","August 24, 2014","true","9.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you enjoy puzzles and have never seen any videos on this game, I would recommend picking it up. However, if you're one of those people who look up solutions to puzzles, or you've watched a playthrough before, I'd suggest you pass on it as it would be a waste. I watched a playthrough before, and because of that I knew many of the secrets way before I was meant to figure them out. I completed the entire game, including all of the secrets, in less than a day (I had to change my computer's clock, otherwise it would've taken me 2-3 days, YES there's a secret that makes you wait several irl days to complete). It was a fun game and I enjoy playing it, I just believe with my knowledge of the game before-hand, the $10 was wasted, it ruined the entire aspect of discovery because I knew how everything worked the instant I got to it.\nBut like I said, if you have never seen anything about this game, and you love puzzles and discoveries and want to be dedicated enough to figure out everything on your own without looking up a guide, YOU WILL LOVE THIS GAME. It has everything, puzzles, secrets, even it's own language! And they aren't the kind of secrets you have to look up (well, except the red heart puzzles, but those have no impact on the game, they're mainly for completionists who want an extreme puzzle challenge), everything you need to know to discover a secret is right there in the game, somewhere, and once you find it you figure out how to solve the puzzles that stumped you before, then you want to run around to areas with unsolved puzzles and complete them (oh and btw, the world map shows you when an area has been completed, so it's easy to tell when you still have a secret).\n\ntl;dr: If you've watched a let's play or any tutorials on this game, or you like to look up guides to complete puzzles, this isn't the game for you and it would be a waste of money. But if you enjoy puzzles and love a challenge, and are blind to the game, I highly highly recommend it.","August 24, 2014","true","9.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is SATISFYING to beat.\n\nCons:\nIf you go into this game not knowing anything about the nature of the puzzles, it's highly unlikely that you'll solve them, or even to know when you're looking at one.  This is exacerbated by the fact that the world map is very convoluted, and time-consuming to traverse.\n\nHowever, if you go in hungry for a challenge, FEZ pays off big time.

Firstly, the concept is fantastic. Who would've thought to make a 2D platformer that you can rotate? The devs could have easily ♥♥♥♥ed up the mechanics in this game regarding said rotation, but they had enough intelligence to not let it be so, and I admire that. The art style was also very nice. It wass a cutesy-patoosty pixelated style, with good integration of 3D shapes. Also, this game doesn't force the story on you. It gives you little clues and hints, and you figure it out on your own. This game very strongly broke the stereotype of indie games being short. It took me 10 hours to complete this game, and I imagine it would take you a lot longer to collect all the cubes. FEZ is also very stable, as I did not encounter a single glitch.\n\nBut, just like any game, it is not perfect. Sometimes I felt that some of the puzzles were too easy. Some. Most puzzles were pretty adequate and there were a few puzzles that were extremely hard. This game, however, doesn't require you to complete said hard puzzles, so you mostly had to drag yourslef through the easy-adequate ones. Also, there was virtually no penalty for dying. I can understand why this is, as the game is already long enough with out it, but a death penalty would have at least been nice. Lastly, there is not a lot of replay value. You might want to replay it to collect all the cubes and explore more, but the campaign is so long that most of it would become a drag.\n\nIn short, this is a puzzler/ exploration/platformer/2D/2.5D/3D game. The art style is nice, the mechanics are great and is only held back by the absence of more challenging puzzles and mediocre amount of replay value. This game is almost easily worth $10, but lucky me got it for a quaint $1.49. I deeply recommend this game.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nToo Bad FEZ 2 Was Cancelled :(\n9.1/10","June 29, 2014","true","10.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I am quite a big indie game fan especially platformers, but this one felt more like a puzzle. In fact, I'd say it's a perfect combination of an adventure, platformer and puzzle game. The feature mechanic is that you can rotate the world which forces you to constantly visualize in 3D as well as in 2D. It works flawlessly in my opinion. This game has a lot of content for an indie game, not only do you have to collect 32 cubes, you can also collect 32 anti-cubes and unlock a ♥♥♥♥ ton of secrets. The music and visuals are top notch, they fit each other and highly remind me of the indie game SuperBrothers: Sword and Sworcery EP. The only flaw I have with this little gem is that travelling between levels can be a pain if you forgot a secret in a certain room. You cannot teleport to whichever level you want, you must pass through warp holes. It's not so bad since you gotta use the map smartly and it adds gameplay value since you cannot rush to whichever place you want. This game entirely deserves its praise, I'll give it a 90/100.

Don't let that distract you too much though - Fez is an excellent game filled to the brim with mind-bending puzzles, secrets to discover, and plenty of platform goodness.\n\nChances are, you've already heard a lot about Fez. The main hook of the game is that it's a platformer, but that the world you explore is actually one with some depth - you can freely rotate the view between the four cardinal views to reveal hidden routes through the level, or to manipulate the space around your character, Gomez. At first, it's a little disorienting, but quickly you learn how to use this new skill smartly.\n\nSo even with this wildly new mechanic thrown in, the platforming is solid and still has that classic feel of the games of old.\n\nThe graphics in Fez are a mix of modern and retro, but it's all very coherent and thoughtful. The same can be said for the awesome throwback soundtrack by Disasterpeace, composed of many excellent, memorable chiptunes.\n\nI really enjoyed the secrets sprinkled throughout Fez. Within the game are a massive amount of hidden rooms, codes to be deciphered, and homages to other games. Some of which help you traverse the game, and some just added for atmosphere. Ultimately, these hidden bits give you the impression that there's always something new to be discovered, just around the corner, so to speak. The developer, Polytron Corporation, obviously put a lot of care into the way the world of Fez was built, and that's just fine with me.\n\nFez is a modern take on the classic platform game, and will leave you with plenty to do (and plenty to think about). Highly recommended!","December 3, 2013","true","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

When this game first came out I remember hearing about all the great reviews this game was getting, and how it was a must-buy, but it never really interested me. I finally bought this game because the deal seemed to good to pass up, and I do not think I have been more pleasantly surprised by a game. I really enjoyed this game and if you like solving puzzles this is also the game for you.\nThe graphics are certainly not the best, but that is the point. However, they are charming at times and the music score fits the environments really well.\nIn my opinion this concept of discovering the third dimension and rotating the space to access new areas was a really interesting and novel idea, and it was done very well. Also the codes in this game show just how much effort the developer put into this game, which to say is quite a lot. Although the controls could be a bit annoying at times, this game overall was fantastic, I am very happy I bought it, and have enjoyed every moment I spent playing it.\nI would recommend this game to anyone looking to be challenged by some zany puzzles whilst having loads of fun.","December 12, 2013","true","12.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

The ingenious platforming and puzzles Phil Fish has crafted in FEZ are not only addicting but also incite you to challenge yourself and explore the world.\n\nI don't normally play games to 100% completion but FEZ is an exception. The game pushes me to the edges of contemplation and back. Everytime you think you've seen the end FEZ adds another layer of depth. Gamers of all ages and backgrounds can enjoy FEZ because of it's easy to pick up controls and lively graphics. Phil Fish truly has made a masterpiece of gaming with FEZ, and I can't wait to see what comes next.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Streakstarold/recommended/224760/","Streakstarold","Streakstar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Streakstarold/","24 products in account","This is a very nice puzzle game that only feels like a puzzle about half the time. If you enjoy puzzles and have never seen any videos on this game, I would recommend picking it up. However, if you're one of those people who look up solutions to puzzles, or you've watched a playthrough before, I'd suggest you pass on it as it would be a waste. I watched a playthrough before, and because of that I knew many of the secrets way before I was meant to figure them out. I completed the entire game, including all of the secrets, in less than a day (I had to change my computer's clock, otherwise it would've taken me 2-3 days, YES there's a secret that makes you wait several irl days to complete). It was a fun game and I enjoy playing it, I just believe with my knowledge of the game before-hand, the $10 was wasted, it ruined the entire aspect of discovery because I knew how everything worked the instant I got to it.\nBut like I said, if you have never seen anything about this game, and you love puzzles and discoveries and want to be dedicated enough to figure out everything on your own without looking up a guide, YOU WILL LOVE THIS GAME. It has everything, puzzles, secrets, even it's own language! And they aren't the kind of secrets you have to look up (well, except the red heart puzzles, but those have no impact on the game, they're mainly for completionists who want an extreme puzzle challenge), everything you need to know to discover a secret is right there in the game, somewhere, and once you find it you figure out how to solve the puzzles that stumped you before, then you want to run around to areas with unsolved puzzles and complete them (oh and btw, the world map shows you when an area has been completed, so it's easy to tell when you still have a secret).\n\ntl;dr: If you've watched a let's play or any tutorials on this game, or you like to look up guides to complete puzzles, this isn't the game for you and it would be a waste of money. But if you enjoy puzzles and love a challenge, and are blind to the game, I highly highly recommend it.","August 24, 2014","true","9.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The platforming in this game I will admit is quite simple, but enjoyable nonetheless. The game is presented in a 2-D format, and the gimmick is that you can flip the view of the world you inhabit 90 degrees at a time, but we'll talk about that later. The atmosphere alone got me spending quite a few hours on this game. Quite a bit more than I should have. You go through sweet grassy plains, to a graveyard, a village with another race of people that have really large heads, and sewers. Though, I never even got to the sewers, because you needed a key to acess it, and I was too lazy to backtrack to find a key.\n\nThe plot itself is bland, but the idea of it is that you are Gomez, a little pale boy from a village bias about the non-existence of cubes. That is until the town elder tells you in his incredibly broken English that you are about to embark on an adventure. Then, a floating yellow cube appears, and goes by the name of the Hexahedron. It starts talking in a weird language that is very hard to understand, but we'll go over that in a little while.\n\nOnce it is finished talking, he'll give you a magical fez to wear, which gives you the ability to flip the 3-D dimensions to view another side of your 2-D world. After you begin toying with flipping dimensions, the Hexahedron will start to shake in a jerky spasm. Flip the world enough times, and he'll shatter into a bunch of tiny shards. THe game will reboot as if your computer crashed, and your adventure begins to collect the 32 cubes that make up the Hexahedron, to stop Gomez's world from falling apart.\n\nI have covered the majority of this games' positives, but really, you are probably reading this to see the faults.\nThe first thing you'll notice after looking at your world map, is that there's a lot of space to cover on your map. By the time you are done the game, your map is going to look like a 3-D model of your computer's motherboard. And if navigating the map was too hard for you, you're not going to have a good time back-tracking. I know I didn't need to backtrack really, but if you neglect getting a lot of the cube pieces in a given area and moving onto another portion of the game, you are really going to regret it.\nWhile were on the subject of backtracking, do you remember how I stated that Gomez's world is falling apart? I probably should have also mentioned that space is starting to rip. As you venture through the game, you'll notice these floating black holes that kill you if you touch them. Going forward, they're not a big issue. But backtracking? You might as well be climbing a mountain made of wet bar soap. I know that if you're lucky, they'll disappear if you re-enter the room, but my gosh, they are like trying to get away from that mean, annoying kid on the playground.\nI know that even with the black holes, you can still progress with some challenge, but their existence is not a pleasant taste in your mouth.\nThe worst thing though, is the language. In order to complete some puzzles, you need to read a button order presented in tetronimos, but in order to understand the button order, you have to turn your head 90 Degrees to the left, which is not enjoyable in any aspect. Phil Fish, you're a great guy, but if yopu do change your mind and do end up creating Fez 2, (Which would be awesome.) make the language somewhat understandable! Some of the character dialogue is impossible to read, even with some kind of chart!\nEven though I had a good go with this game, you are not going to walk away from your computer with a smile on your face if are not patient. But if you can come out on the other side of the backtracking and black holes, I do believe you will eventually forget the agony, and stop to look at the beutiful scenery this game has in stor for you, or it's truly moving sounds.\nThat's why, my final verdict for this game... is an 8 out of 10. I really do hope you check out this game and see how you do. and try to re-create the Hexahedron completely out of Anti-Cubes if you can plow through the flaws!\n\nI recommend this game to players in-between casual and intermediate. Have a good playthrough!\n\n","January 21, 2014","true","37.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Navigation through worlds is a little bit frustrating as well, as you have to constantly refer back to the map in order to see the next screenshot of the area you need to go to next to pass through.\n\nAnd I'm not even going to start on the black holes............................ x_x\n\nBut overall, yes.

No? Ok, so in this game you climb and jump up and down buildings/landscapes and get over obstacles on a 2d dimension, but you do it by spinning the 3D room and walking on sides in a 2D manner. While surfaces always combine to new possible ways because they line up through the new perspective.\nDoesn't make any sense? Yeah, I said its hard to explain...  go watch some gameplay.\nAAAAAAnyway, review:\nThis game has a very unique idea, and executes it well with barly no glitches/control problems at all. You get used to the whole idea of swtiching perspective really quick, and the world is designed in creative ways.\nThe plattforming is mostly easy though, and the puzzles so far where either very easy, or unsolveable (or maybe im an idiot?). But I guess some puzzles are solved over longer time-frames torwards the end of the game, as this plattformer is actually a very open expierience in terms of world design. Instead of hopping through level for level (aka mario bros way of doing things), you actually are supposed to roam around and discover and explore, and maybe revisit some of the areas.\nAnd the game world is huge, really.\nAside from that, it doesn't look like there is much happening, its exploring, puzzles and jumping, no fights or anything like that, so if you looking for action plattformers, this is not for you.\nFor me the game got a bit boring after a while, maybe the game-world is just to big for my attention span...\nBut if you a really into exploring and less for action, this game is your go to game.\n'nuff said.","January 27, 2014","true","12.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(Did I spoil something?)\n\nThe only down side of this game is that it’s a little boring sometimes because it’s a rather slow game, but I guess it depends a little on what mood you are in.\n\nBut in the end it’s a wonderful game which can be completely finished in about 15 hours (all the secrets and stuff).","December 11, 2013","true","13.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Puzzles range from easy to challenging with every step inbetween.  Sometimes the unnatural controls can hinder the expierence but practice makes perfect.  There are a ton of cubes to collect and areas which you will certainly have to revisit in the second playthrough.  Buy this if you like puzzles that require you only to move things around until solved or give enough thought to play through efficiently.

What I was not expecting was to cover my desk with notes, madly scrambling to write down in-game clues and decryption codes to hidden messages for days on end, slowly going insane as I became more and more emersed in this bizarre world.\n\nWhile it appears simple and flat, the story in FEZ has surprising depth (Eh? Get it? Because of the turning thing? Oh, nevermind.) It's halfway a parody of everything 8-bit and old school, and halfway a crazy world of its own. The world is vast and beautiful, the puzzles range from simple to complex and involved, and the music is wonderful. Overall a great game.

There's a whole lot to love about FEZ, such as the ingenious level design and mechanics, great music and overall look and feel. It doesn't take itself too seriously, yet there are heaps of secrets which you'll be hard-pressed to discover all on your own without the help of Google. There are some great attention to detail, and low specs required are also a bonus for those with an old rig. I haven't tested, but I'm willing to bet it will run just fine on an Intel HD 3000 at around 768p.\nIt's not perfect, with a world map that is difficult to navigate, few (and I mean very few) levels which resort to clichéd design, and general antagonism to keyboard-and-mouse setup. It's not by any means unplayable and it can be done just fine with a classic setup, but still it was the first time ever I've played any game and wished for a controller. Fair enough, it's ported from XBLA and all, but even simple things like being able to continue using my arrow keys to look around in first-person mode would have made a world of difference.\nSmall niggling things aside, it made a platformer fan out of me, and I'm sure it will for a lot of other people.","November 26, 2013","true","8.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

As much as anyone might hate Phil Fish... this game is an absolute MASTERPIECE.\n\nIt is a little tad bit boring off the start, but as the game progresses it gets more and more interesting, and at the same time, more and more difficult.\n\nThe difficulty of the game is nothing to laugh about, don't underestimate it at first. I found myself looking up guides quite frequent, maybe it is because I'm generally bad at puzzle games, but still, the game gets pretty damn difficult. Hell, the game even incorporates its own language system. It is amazing!\n\nThe art and music are a huge selling point though. Fez might be one of the most charming looking pixelated-games I have seen in a LONG TIME. The art is stunning and beautiful. The Music is calm and soothing at point, and fits well with the scene, while at other it is fast and intense to, like I said, again, match the scene.\n\nProbably what makes this game unique from other pixel based platformers, is the game changing mechanic to change your perspective of the world you are exploring. Honestly, without this mechaninc the game would be boring. But it's not. The puzzle are more difficult then you have probably seen in a puzzle game because oft his. It truly does make the game magnificent. Also, let us not forget about the fun first-person view once you continue on to "New Game +".\n\nAll and all, Fez is just a charmingly difficult amazement of a game. Just go buy it now.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenix_advance/recommended/224760/","phoenix_advance","phoenix_advance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenix_advance/","515 products in account","Surprising. Very, VERY surprising. I’ve been quite skeptical about FEZ because I generally haven’t appreciated any Indie platformers. In fact when I started this game, I was almost so certain to call it a disaster blaming the fact that Phil had wasted too much time on the pixel art rather than the gameplay. And I also had this feeling I was going to have an Arkham City type of debate with sauce, because it’s always enjoyable seeing him rage a bit ;P\n\nBut no, this game is genuinely worth playing. If you ever enjoyed playing Prince of Persia (on MS-DOS), The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening (on Gameboy) and Tetris (also on Gameboy) with a dash of the infamous Rubik’s Cube (amazingly I solved that after losing the instructions as a kid) then as sauce would say, “You owe it to yourself to buy this game.” … for old times’ sake.\n\nThe gameplay is very basic, it follows in the classical “Find the Cheese” that some of the very old games use to implement as a way to aid developers by marking waypoints. For example finding the cheese in Perfect Dark on N64. In this case you need to find cube fragments.\n\nWhat I really found surprising was the game engine itself. Essentially I’m pretty sure the world is 3D. But you only have 4 side perspectives of the world. It’s easy to figure out, but I have no idea how Phil Fish or Renaud Bédard pieced all the puzzles and level designs together. Because it would be a mind ♥♥♥♥ to program as platforms from 1 side can interchangeably connect to 2 other sides.\n\nI also found the world map fascinating. Initially it looks really messy. But after a few rotations it makes sense and the legends are clearly marked. The learning curve for the usability of this game is incredibly fast and easy to understand. Bonus points for that.\n\nThe ending was just astonishing. I highly recommend watching Indie Game: The Movie before attempting to finish this game otherwise you won’t understand the ending (which I reckon is a connection to Phil Fish’s childhood).\n\nI haven’t quite finished the game yet. I’ve done 113% which is the base game. But I think you can go to 200% but it’s mainly finding anti-cubes (which are harder to find than normal cubes) I suspect there’ll be some sort of secret unlock once that’s done. I’d say this is purely for replayability and ya know what, it works …","September 25, 2013","true","9.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","4"

The platforming is solid, the puzzles range from easy-to-solve platform jumping and translating an alien language trying to understand what it means. Perhaps my favorite aspect of this game is that, although it's a 2-D Sidescroller, it feels like you're exploring an open world. Everything is connected, you can either use the warp portals to make your way back to the beginning, or you can run the whole way back and I consider that impressive! Here's the Pro's and Con's. Pro's: Fun and fluid gameplay, Interesting 3-D mechanic, Great Soundtrack, Challenging Puzzles, and Memorable Areas. Con's: some of the puzzles seem to require a degree in Cryptology, you'll sometimes get very lost with seemingly nowhere to go (albeit this is rare).

I am quite a big indie game fan especially platformers, but this one felt more like a puzzle. In fact, I'd say it's a perfect combination of an adventure, platformer and puzzle game. The feature mechanic is that you can rotate the world which forces you to constantly visualize in 3D as well as in 2D. It works flawlessly in my opinion. This game has a lot of content for an indie game, not only do you have to collect 32 cubes, you can also collect 32 anti-cubes and unlock a ♥♥♥♥ ton of secrets. The music and visuals are top notch, they fit each other and highly remind me of the indie game SuperBrothers: Sword and Sworcery EP. The only flaw I have with this little gem is that travelling between levels can be a pain if you forgot a secret in a certain room. You cannot teleport to whichever level you want, you must pass through warp holes. It's not so bad since you gotta use the map smartly and it adds gameplay value since you cannot rush to whichever place you want. This game entirely deserves its praise, I'll give it a 90/100.

This game is ostensibly a puzzle game, but it's really an exploration game.  The idea is more of discovering and exploring a curious world and learning its ins and outs.  There are definitely some puzzles, but they're either extremely simple or spread across the world.  There are a lot of things to like, as long as you're ready for the experience.\n\nSide note: if you don't have a QR reading app or know what that means, you will be disappointed, as they use this in several places as puzzle "solutions".  Even though I have one I feel like this is extremely weak game design, but I'd also say it's the greatest weakness the game has.  I do recommend this if you want a vast, curious world to explore.","August 14, 2013","true","25.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In addition to a cute little guy that likes sleeping when you're not playing for 30 seconds, and this mixes up FEZ. The game consists of a parallel between a 3D and 2D experience like I've never seen before. To successfully accomplish a level, one must be able to solve the puzzle from both the 2D platform, and the 3D level to move forward with the game. It presented good challenges that really made me think at times, a little too much sometimes however. Here's my advantages and disadvantages:\n\nAdvantages:\nBroad and colorful theme.\nSmooth gameplay in regards to frames\nStoryline was decent\nA very nice puzzle platformer with a great transition between 2D and 3D modeling\n\nDisadvantages:\nThe move scheme seemed too much as an "ice level" when you try to move through\nOverall one track plays the entire game, making it repetitive and draws boredom over time\nWhile I may not be an absolute genius, some puzzles seemed a little ridiculous to move on, and since there is hardly any sort of tracking where you have traveled, excluding a very broad map, it becomes something that requires a lot  more time than needed to invest into the game\n\nOverall: 7 out of 10","January 10, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You're taken into different worlds, each with a different atmosphere and a complimentary soundtrack in order to find the 64 pieces of the puzzle. There were moments that were annoying or where you would get lost with the plethora of doors, and some puzzles required you to look up where certain pieces were(unless you know how to read QR codes and hex).

My Mother said to me- "Don't smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed and at 21 I have never touched a cigarette.

Anyway,  the game is a great experience.  I enjoy exploring every nook and cranny of the levels and finding secrets all over the game world.  The levels are very imaginative and well animated.  The pixel art style and orthographic camera rotation behavior work well together.  It is far from perfect, but it is a very unique and engrossing experience.\n\nPros:\n1. Imaginative world and plot.\n2. Lovable main character.\n3. Loads of secrets and challenging puzzles.\n\nCons:\n1. Some technical flaws hidden well by fake glitches most of the time but the game crashes/freezes/hangs a lot.\n2. Some sections of the game can be unnecessarily confusing.\n3. Hard to find your way around the game world.\n\nThe pros outweigh the cons in my opinion.","July 23, 2013","true","5.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I expected the game to be polished, to have challanging dimention-based puzzles, and a potentially pretentious story or presentation. After playing the game to the end (or at least the end that I'm willing to tolerate), I have no desire to see what its new game plus has to offer, nor do I care about what I missed. In a puzzle game, if your player feels like this, you failed as a developer.\n\nIn Fez, there is a language that you will have to learn if you want to finish the game, or you could just do the sensible thing and look it up on line or you can: spend hours exploring every room, writing everything said in game down out of game, decifering the code using context clues, and eventually figuring out the entire alphabet as well as directions. For some people that may seem life fun, but it's definitly a very small niche. If you like codebreaking, then Fez is a gem. If you want a fun, challanging, or interesting puzzle game, you are out of luck.\n\nAs for the puzzles, they were often straight forward if they didn't involve the Fez language. The game was mostly platforming, which I didn't like. The wasn't too much of a challange in figuring out most of the levels in game. There was also little moments of frustration when the mechanics refused to work properly, such as when grabbing on to vines. The game wasn't challanging so much as it was time consuming.\n\nAs for the good points, the sound design is well done. The background noise and the music are enjoyable. At times it was relaxing, and at other times, it was a bit unsettling. I enjoyed that at the very least.\n\nTo conclude, as a puzzle game, Fez falls flat for me. It's a competent platformer, and (if it's your thing) has an interesting code to crack (if you don't mind that it has already been cracked for several years now and can be found easily online). There are a lot of better puzzle games, puzzle platform games, and games in general.\n\nAlso, I figure I should put this in here, I knew nothing of the controvery around Fez's creator. I didn't dislike this game because he made it. I disliked it because it was frusrating, boring, and remarkably unengaging from so many angle (gameplay was unchallanging, the story wasn't interesting, the characters weren't defined or remarkable in any way).

There's a whole lot to love about FEZ, such as the ingenious level design and mechanics, great music and overall look and feel. It doesn't take itself too seriously, yet there are heaps of secrets which you'll be hard-pressed to discover all on your own without the help of Google. There are some great attention to detail, and low specs required are also a bonus for those with an old rig. I haven't tested, but I'm willing to bet it will run just fine on an Intel HD 3000 at around 768p.\nIt's not perfect, with a world map that is difficult to navigate, few (and I mean very few) levels which resort to clichéd design, and general antagonism to keyboard-and-mouse setup. It's not by any means unplayable and it can be done just fine with a classic setup, but still it was the first time ever I've played any game and wished for a controller. Fair enough, it's ported from XBLA and all, but even simple things like being able to continue using my arrow keys to look around in first-person mode would have made a world of difference.\nSmall niggling things aside, it made a platformer fan out of me, and I'm sure it will for a lot of other people.","November 26, 2013","true","8.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

Overall, I have to recommend this because I've never seen anything like it and I just can't get over the core mechanic.

This game... was certainly not at all what I expected. Taken its development history, and the whole Phil Fish drama and subsequent backlash, I had this game in the back of my mind, labelled as a simple indie platformer.\n\nStill, I wouldn't lose anything for playing it. And I went for it, expecting a pretty platformer.\n\nSeveral days later, I found myself in a room... papers on the floor, with weird symbols and ciphers on them.\n\n\n\nWell, maybe I'm embellishing the story a little bit, but that was the feeling I got from it. And it felt damn good.\n\n\nAlright. Fez is NOT your traditional game. It's not as much of a platformer as it is a puzzle game. And also not a typical puzzle game. Its final puzzles created a community around the game, everyone trying to solve them as a group for several months. Even now, there are possible mysteries still unknown to most players. And that's not an easy thing to do. I mean... it's the Internet!\n\nI usually like to do a review to fully analyze each aspect of a game, going throught the graphics, music, game mechanics, some design flaws, etc. I'm pretty sure I'll run out of words going on about Fez. So I'll just try to convey what the game did differently from most games, and why you should or should not play it.\n\nI'll give its presentation a brief paragraph. If you're not saturated of the retro, pixel-art look, Fez looks amazing. Despite having a fairly simple visual style, it has a huge attention to detail, and lots of different kinds of areas, each equally impressive. I can't imagine how much work has been put into it, but the final result surely did not disappoint me.\nThe music is equally good! It's mostly a relaxing kind of chiptunes, with the occasional darker tone. But it's really good, and I might listen to it outside the game, at times. I might also add that they never got repetitive, or just stopped out of nowhere. Everything there flowed perfectly.\nRegarding the controls, menus and interface, I didn't have a single issue with it, it had anything I needed.\n\n\nOnward to the game itself, then!\n\nSuperficially, Fez is a 2D platformer with a particular mechanic: the whole world is actually a cube, meaning that you'll have to rotate its 4 faces to get from one place to another, and gather all the collectibles. This mechanic seems more of a novelty (and to a point it is, in terms of simple platforming), but turns out to be more important later on.\n\nThere is barely any punishment for falling off platforms, and there's no combat, so Fez isn't a stressing game from an action standpoint.\nWhat you essentially do, is collect Cubes, to open gates. You can either collect an entire Cube from solving a puzzle, or you can gather 8 little pieces that form a single Cube. In the end, if all went well, you'll have collected all 32 Cubes. These can be\ngathered by simple puzzling and platforming, a way of casually "beating" the game, for the casual player.\n\nTo do it, the player has to go through each main areas of the game, each of them introducing a small mechanics. Some have\nrotational platforms and valves, one has invisible platforms (which the player can see through the rain bumping into those), etc. These are all simple, but keep the game from getting too stale.\n\nThere are also Chests that can contain Keys (to open some doors into other areas), or Treasure Maps. These are mostly used for later puzzles.\n\nSeeing the game from this perspective, it's not as impressive as what comes later. But still, it looks great, and you can get some of the backstory from the ancient wall paintings, keeping the world mysterious.\n\nBUT. All over the game, the player will see hints at a previous civilizations. Maybe their ancestors. He'll see scribbles on the walls, paintings depicting some society, and later encounter different people in a whole different city, speaking a whole different language.\nDuring my first playthrough, I often questioned what these symbols were, but assumed it was mostly flavour text.\nThat this, until I decided to look at the Achievements, and saw a weird one, with a pattern. I tried it in-game and got a special AntiCube. Just like a normal Cube, but dark.\nI went on to read about it, and found out there were another 32 AntiCubes, much harder to obtain. Well, my journey wasn't over just yet.\n\nIn fact, the real game had just begun. And this was a totally different game.\nThis time around, in NewGame+, I gained one new ability: first person view. I could stand and look around, this time, just to find more scribbles at certain places, inthe ground.\nTo solve it, I had to decrypt the whole language of the world.\n\nThere was a very cryptic clue that totally passed me by, and so I had to talk to the townsfolk and try to find patterns to decode all letters, one by one.\nThen, there was also a numeric system. Another one to decypher.\nThere were QR codes (well, I just searched the pictures on the internet and then scanned them, only to find more codes in them).\nI waited by the ClockTower.\nI talked to Owls.\nI rotated the world to a beat.\nI've done everything I thought I'd never had to do in a videogame.\n\nEvery single puzzle had a very subtle clue to it. Some I found and felt like a genius. Some of them I completely missed.\nThe kind of puzzle complexity is Fez was something I certainly did NOT expect, and it only gets more complex near the end. But everything can be deduced from what the player is given.\nAfter all of that, the player can most likely go around the world once more, and see everything as a new man, with a deeper understanding of its surroundings, trying to fit every story bit into place.\nAnd that was great, even with the occasional aid of hints found online. (If you're having difficulties, I'd recommend finding just tips, and not an actual guide, so that you can do the detective work yourself, without having to be stuck for too long).\n\nWell, one of the later tasks was discovered by decoding the game's executable, and looking through the code for clues.\nEverything regarding the game has clues! The code, the assets, the achievements... it's really weird, but at the same time, really awesome!\n\n\nOne thing I don't think the game does all that well, is giving the player enough information to what he should be looking into to solve the puzzles.\nIts puzzles are so diverse that the player can't get into a state of mind to solve them all. You'll have to go through it little by little, interpreting all sorts of different clues.\nAnd sure, that was most likely intentional, but I'm not sure about it working all that well, to be honest.\nIt must have been amazing when the game came out, working as a community, trying to solve all of those cryptic puzzles. That's something that I don't remember any game doing without feeling a frustrating mess. It's something that Fez should be remembered for, but that also detracts a bit from the experience as a late comer. Most of it has already been done before, and you'll risk being too spoiled by looking at hints online.\n\nAnother minor complaint you might have, is that the game is advertised as a platformer, more of a very complex puzzle game. And the platforming isn't spectacular, it's not the focus at all. And you might be right. But at the same time, it provides a different feeling of real discovery that you wouldn't otherwise get (oops, sorry for spoiling it for you).\n\n\nThis was more of a rant than a review. But I can't really do a proper review of this game, sorry. I need time to digest it all, maybe even go through it once more in the future.\nAnd I'd like to read about it, or watch a deeper analysis on it. And all I see, is the Phil Fish drama. And it's a real shame.\nPeople have focused their attentions in the wrong aspect of Fez.\n\nThis is a really unique and awesome game that should be remembered for uniting people into solving its deeper mysteries, in a fully fleshed out world, with its own culture!","May 23, 2014","true","13.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(If you're having difficulties, I'd recommend finding just tips, and not an actual guide, so that you can do the detective work yourself, without having to be stuck for too long).\n\nWell, one of the later tasks was discovered by decoding the game's executable, and looking through the code for clues.\nEverything regarding the game has clues! The code, the assets, the achievements... it's really weird, but at the same time, really awesome!\n\n\nOne thing I don't think the game does all that well, is giving the player enough information to what he should be looking into to solve the puzzles.\nIts puzzles are so diverse that the player can't get into a state of mind to solve them all. You'll have to go through it little by little, interpreting all sorts of different clues.\nAnd sure, that was most likely intentional, but I'm not sure about it working all that well, to be honest.\nIt must have been amazing when the game came out, working as a community, trying to solve all of those cryptic puzzles. That's something that I don't remember any game doing without feeling a frustrating mess. It's something that Fez should be remembered for, but that also detracts a bit from the experience as a late comer. Most of it has already been done before, and you'll risk being too spoiled by looking at hints online.\n\nAnother minor complaint you might have, is that the game is advertised as a platformer, more of a very complex puzzle game. And the platforming isn't spectacular, it's not the focus at all. And you might be right. But at the same time, it provides a different feeling of real discovery that you wouldn't otherwise get (oops, sorry for spoiling it for you).\n\n\nThis was more of a rant than a review. But I can't really do a proper review of this game, sorry. I need time to digest it all, maybe even go through it once more in the future.\nAnd I'd like to read about it, or watch a deeper analysis on it. And all I see, is the Phil Fish drama. And it's a real shame.\nPeople have focused their attentions in the wrong aspect of Fez.\n\nThis is a really unique and awesome game that should be remembered for uniting people into solving its deeper mysteries, in a fully fleshed out world, with its own culture!","May 23, 2014","true","13.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You start of with a cute little character (Gomez) that has been given the task to save the world from being destroyed by being placed from a 2D realm to a 3D & 2D realm. Gomez is given a fez by a giant floating yellow hexahedron, which allows him to see the world he once saw only 2D, but now can see both 2D and 3D. However, this causes his entire universe to start falling apart. The player's job is to find cubes around his universe to repair the deteriorating beyond.\n\nThis game is basically a calm adventure puzzle game. One has the ability to rotate the world from left to right to get a whole different perspective of the world one is currently in. Since FEZ is based around discovery, rotating the world can allow one to find cubes and get to certain places for new discoveries. It's a very unique way of solving puzzles, it just puts a lot of fun into climbing towers by fixing the view of something that seemed impossible, but from another view, is completely possible.\n\nThe gameplay is one controlling Gomez by walking and jumping to different worlds and finding the cubes. There are a lot of them out there, so be prepared to search everywhere.\n\nThe music fits the game very nicely with tranquil music that fits the atmosphere of the game and the mood of trying to solve puzzles. It's also quite catchy and just plain fun to listen to.\n\nThe controls of Gomez are pretty tight in controlling him. One has WASD to move and Spacebar to jump, but he also can grab ledges and crawl along the walls and vines, leading to some unknown places that one couldn't get to by just walking or jumping.\n\nFortunately, the not-so-good parts of the game are scarce. One could get lost/frustrated about navigating through many many places of the universe, looking in every corner for a cube. Also, trying to find some cubes in worlds and also trying to find a way to get to said-world can be a bit boring. However, it is enjoyable to search new worlds for cubes and figure out many puzzles with spinning the world around like a top.\n\nAll in all, this game is very enjoyable and a really fun puzzle adventure, enjoyable by all.","August 20, 2014","true","5.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

FEZ is a romantic comedy starring David Spade as former KGB Agent turned Kid's Magician, Roy Magestico who develops a huge wand for none other than Leela Loolee personified in the mortal form of Dakota Fanning. Things take a turn when Roy discovers he has inoperable colon cancer during one of his shows, prompting him to move faster than he would otherwise have done in order to obtain his true love.\nHis obstacle, aside from the aforementioned fatal whimsy of God, is the grizzled and chizzled adonnis, Spadge O'Hoolahan (Ricky Gervais). Spadge is a nasty and selfish man who, despite whopping huge wads of cash, does not entirely understand his own raison d'être, why is Spadge here? What does he do? Spadge is a gamechanger because he runs out of tissues.\nThe cinematography is. The canted angles and in media res reaks of Tarantino, just without the hair. Patting the rather obese Chilean wombat proves rather obscene when Al Kongo (Roger Moore) is resurrected in the world's first internet streamed bovine intervention.\nFEZ fails to recognise the core basics of the mechanic which does not bode well for the industry. The final scene where Spadge and Roy confront each other on a pier somewhere off the coast of Hungary leaves a lot to be desired, let alone the geographical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥isation of what was once a proud empire. Shirley Bassey gets white girl drunk in the scene before that, not that any of this matters, because of the Deus Ex Machina introduced by young Whopper Cole (The Coca Cola Company) which is that he has a magical laser, sponsored by the power of Coke, which can cure poor David Spade's ♥♥♥♥ or something.\nI will be honest, FEZ lost my attention quickly. Was there too much focus on the cancer and not enough on the gazelle straddling the roof of Dakota Fanning's Luxurious and roomy yacht? Why does the restaurant conundrum go unsolved? Where did they find all those badger hats? And, perhaps most importantly, Why? All of the above questions can't be answered by FEZ. It falls short at the first hurdle, losing track of all that is holy.\nTo conclude, would I agree that FEZ is an entity? I could be convinced. Would I allow my freedom loving American tadpole offspring the right to touch it? Who knows. It is an enigma within an anarcho-syndicalist capital estate hitherto unspoken and unseen by humanity. Is this reviewer craving a piece of edible food? Only just.","December 16, 2013","true","0.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

I managed to beat the first level but my frustration and shouting caused a series of unfortunate events to occur, first my child awoke from my pained exhaultations and began to follow my activity with it's own personal twist of replacing my rage and frenzy into emotions and fear and discontent. Upon this child's screams laying gently upon my wife's morphine laced ears, she realised the situation involved a possible chance of me throwing the Liquid Crystal Display based viewing monitor carefully connected my my hard drive by the large greasy man from PC world who helped set up my computer when my previous failures caused two things, one, my wife's black eye, and two, me having to pay the gentleman to keep quiet and to return wo his home planet of Personal Computers without any mention of his experiences in our dimensional plane. Upon picking up the child she began calling the police in the fear that she would be subject to what i can only describe as a Beltbuckle whirlwind, I couldnt stop her as i usually could because I was too busy trying to figure out if what i was playing was a game or just a poor excue to exploit a gimmick that ends up just confusing the player and not providing anything new to a genre that was once a bastion of difficulty adn challenge, but with the addition of little to no enemies feztakes this genre into a direction that seemed good but was infact a step into uncle bubba's basement full of mystical wonders and restraining equipment.The police arrived promptly given my previous offenses and found the fifteen ankle bracelets that they had assigned to me all lying on the floor in a pattern that spelled out the words 'i fought the law and the law won'. The irony was not lost on me. I am writing this review from prison during my precious few minutes i am allowed on the rec room's computer time sheet. This is all just to pass time of course becausei can expect that my inmate (known only as big jim and i can tell you he is only 5'9 so the operative word 'big' must refer to either his hands or feet, or at least a hope so). The tragedy of this situation is that he wasn't planning on having his way with me until i mentioned that i preferred platformers that utilise enemy placement and difficulty and not just use silly gimmicks to trick people into thinking time and effort was put into a game, but unfortunately big jim disagreed. Well thank you fez, for the impending traumatic experience, i hope you realise just how pathetic you are, at least in my last moments of anal virginity i retain a shred of self respect which is not particularly easy for an abusive husband/father.","August 16, 2014","false","1.3"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","13","26","2","0"

This game... was certainly not at all what I expected. Taken its development history, and the whole Phil Fish drama and subsequent backlash, I had this game in the back of my mind, labelled as a simple indie platformer.\n\nStill, I wouldn't lose anything for playing it. And I went for it, expecting a pretty platformer.\n\nSeveral days later, I found myself in a room... papers on the floor, with weird symbols and ciphers on them.\n\n\n\nWell, maybe I'm embellishing the story a little bit, but that was the feeling I got from it. And it felt damn good.\n\n\nAlright. Fez is NOT your traditional game. It's not as much of a platformer as it is a puzzle game. And also not a typical puzzle game. Its final puzzles created a community around the game, everyone trying to solve them as a group for several months. Even now, there are possible mysteries still unknown to most players. And that's not an easy thing to do. I mean... it's the Internet!\n\nI usually like to do a review to fully analyze each aspect of a game, going throught the graphics, music, game mechanics, some design flaws, etc. I'm pretty sure I'll run out of words going on about Fez. So I'll just try to convey what the game did differently from most games, and why you should or should not play it.\n\nI'll give its presentation a brief paragraph. If you're not saturated of the retro, pixel-art look, Fez looks amazing. Despite having a fairly simple visual style, it has a huge attention to detail, and lots of different kinds of areas, each equally impressive. I can't imagine how much work has been put into it, but the final result surely did not disappoint me.\nThe music is equally good! It's mostly a relaxing kind of chiptunes, with the occasional darker tone. But it's really good, and I might listen to it outside the game, at times. I might also add that they never got repetitive, or just stopped out of nowhere. Everything there flowed perfectly.\nRegarding the controls, menus and interface, I didn't have a single issue with it, it had anything I needed.\n\n\nOnward to the game itself, then!\n\nSuperficially, Fez is a 2D platformer with a particular mechanic: the whole world is actually a cube, meaning that you'll have to rotate its 4 faces to get from one place to another, and gather all the collectibles. This mechanic seems more of a novelty (and to a point it is, in terms of simple platforming), but turns out to be more important later on.\n\nThere is barely any punishment for falling off platforms, and there's no combat, so Fez isn't a stressing game from an action standpoint.\nWhat you essentially do, is collect Cubes, to open gates. You can either collect an entire Cube from solving a puzzle, or you can gather 8 little pieces that form a single Cube. In the end, if all went well, you'll have collected all 32 Cubes. These can be\ngathered by simple puzzling and platforming, a way of casually "beating" the game, for the casual player.\n\nTo do it, the player has to go through each main areas of the game, each of them introducing a small mechanics. Some have\nrotational platforms and valves, one has invisible platforms (which the player can see through the rain bumping into those), etc. These are all simple, but keep the game from getting too stale.\n\nThere are also Chests that can contain Keys (to open some doors into other areas), or Treasure Maps. These are mostly used for later puzzles.\n\nSeeing the game from this perspective, it's not as impressive as what comes later. But still, it looks great, and you can get some of the backstory from the ancient wall paintings, keeping the world mysterious.\n\nBUT. All over the game, the player will see hints at a previous civilizations. Maybe their ancestors. He'll see scribbles on the walls, paintings depicting some society, and later encounter different people in a whole different city, speaking a whole different language.\nDuring my first playthrough, I often questioned what these symbols were, but assumed it was mostly flavour text.\nThat this, until I decided to look at the Achievements, and saw a weird one, with a pattern. I tried it in-game and got a special AntiCube. Just like a normal Cube, but dark.\nI went on to read about it, and found out there were another 32 AntiCubes, much harder to obtain. Well, my journey wasn't over just yet.\n\nIn fact, the real game had just begun. And this was a totally different game.\nThis time around, in NewGame+, I gained one new ability: first person view. I could stand and look around, this time, just to find more scribbles at certain places, inthe ground.\nTo solve it, I had to decrypt the whole language of the world.\n\nThere was a very cryptic clue that totally passed me by, and so I had to talk to the townsfolk and try to find patterns to decode all letters, one by one.\nThen, there was also a numeric system. Another one to decypher.\nThere were QR codes (well, I just searched the pictures on the internet and then scanned them, only to find more codes in them).\nI waited by the ClockTower.\nI talked to Owls.\nI rotated the world to a beat.\nI've done everything I thought I'd never had to do in a videogame.\n\nEvery single puzzle had a very subtle clue to it. Some I found and felt like a genius. Some of them I completely missed.\nThe kind of puzzle complexity is Fez was something I certainly did NOT expect, and it only gets more complex near the end. But everything can be deduced from what the player is given.\nAfter all of that, the player can most likely go around the world once more, and see everything as a new man, with a deeper understanding of its surroundings, trying to fit every story bit into place.\nAnd that was great, even with the occasional aid of hints found online. (If you're having difficulties, I'd recommend finding just tips, and not an actual guide, so that you can do the detective work yourself, without having to be stuck for too long).\n\nWell, one of the later tasks was discovered by decoding the game's executable, and looking through the code for clues.\nEverything regarding the game has clues! The code, the assets, the achievements... it's really weird, but at the same time, really awesome!\n\n\nOne thing I don't think the game does all that well, is giving the player enough information to what he should be looking into to solve the puzzles.\nIts puzzles are so diverse that the player can't get into a state of mind to solve them all. You'll have to go through it little by little, interpreting all sorts of different clues.\nAnd sure, that was most likely intentional, but I'm not sure about it working all that well, to be honest.\nIt must have been amazing when the game came out, working as a community, trying to solve all of those cryptic puzzles. That's something that I don't remember any game doing without feeling a frustrating mess. It's something that Fez should be remembered for, but that also detracts a bit from the experience as a late comer. Most of it has already been done before, and you'll risk being too spoiled by looking at hints online.\n\nAnother minor complaint you might have, is that the game is advertised as a platformer, more of a very complex puzzle game. And the platforming isn't spectacular, it's not the focus at all. And you might be right. But at the same time, it provides a different feeling of real discovery that you wouldn't otherwise get (oops, sorry for spoiling it for you).\n\n\nThis was more of a rant than a review. But I can't really do a proper review of this game, sorry. I need time to digest it all, maybe even go through it once more in the future.\nAnd I'd like to read about it, or watch a deeper analysis on it. And all I see, is the Phil Fish drama. And it's a real shame.\nPeople have focused their attentions in the wrong aspect of Fez.\n\nThis is a really unique and awesome game that should be remembered for uniting people into solving its deeper mysteries, in a fully fleshed out world, with its own culture!","May 23, 2014","true","13.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
