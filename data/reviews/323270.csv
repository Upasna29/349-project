"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shiaakuma/recommended/323270/","shiaakuma","shiaakuma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shiaakuma/","696 products in account","With the vast number of hidden object games available, there are plenty of other places to spend your money that would be more satisfying.\n\nGameplay is the typical old-fashioned HO style: a handful of scenes to complete per chapter, then advancing to the next chapter and next set of scenes, etc.  This is pure hidden-object with an occasional minigame tossed in for variety.  If you're looking for more of a HO/Adventure game (i.e. the Artifex Mundi style), with puzzles and inventory and object usage, this is not the game you're looking for.\n\nGameplay itself is easy and the HO puzzles and minigames are not overly challenging.  Problems come in when objects are not well-labeled, making you search for something that actually is something else entirely.  There is also lack of precision with objects layered on top of other objects; there have been times in my playthrough where I couldn't click an objec that was directly behind another one, forcing me to pixel-hunt for a clickable spot (with the accompanying irritating error beep every time the top object blocked the other).\n\nThe dialogue is stilted and not believable.  Dialogue cutscenes that advance the game are tedious and hard to read due to the poor grammar and writing.  I don't expect these games to be the height of literature, but I do expect appropriate proofreading and quality control.  That said, I don't know this game's origins and it may actually be a poor translation into English if this was originally in a different language.\n\nI have a personal fascination with Templar history, which is why I picked this up, but unfortunately the tedium and poor writing vastly overpowered my love of Grail legends.  Given a choice, I would not purchase again, and I'm relieved I got this one on sale.  It's not godawful for what it is, but I would personally exhaust the myriad other HO games available first before considering this one.","March 20, 2015","false","2.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Nothing too amazing about it but nothing all that bad either. I quite enjoyed it and I think if you’re a fan of the genre you will to.\n\nThe story is alright, it’s something you can follow but it’s not the most engrossing or thrilling. Also, I think it left on a cliff-hanger? I’m not entirely sure. I wasn’t paying all that much attention to be honest.\n\nIt’s quite short, took about 2 hours to complete. So if you want a nice quick game to play to kill a few hours this one is good for that.\n\nIn terms of art style/blending and all the other media,\nThere is no voice acting for one, but the music is quite relaxing. I found it mildly interesting that certain objects in the scenes make noises. Seeing as you can scroll your sight around the room in this game, it was quite handy a few times. For example, I needed to find a clock and I could hear a ticking coming from the far left of the room.\nThe art style is nice and the blending of objects can at times can be quite good. Was a few times I couldn’t find what I needed because it was blended in too well. I mean, it’s not amazing stuff but I’ve seen a lot worse.\n\nAll in all I think this one is neutral. I’m not going to leap at you to tell you to buy it now because it’s unmissable, I have no reason to really. But I also have no reason to tell you to stay clear of it.\n\n\nTL;DR : It’s alright, pretty standard really. Only notable thing being that it’s only about 2 hours playtime.\n","December 28, 2015","true","2.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
