From the day we experience gravity to the day we are transported into eternity, we keep learning and trying to position ourselves to create a bright future. However, sometimes we procrastinate when deciding which direction we should follow. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a little hint once in a while? I know, I need to pay a visit to the extraordinary Mrs Kismet; she’ll have the answer!\n\nKismet is a casual/atmospheric virtual reality fortune teller experience. At Mrs Kismet’s place, you can have your question(s) answered via a set of tarots cards, where you will have to pick three cards (past, present and future) out of the twenty-two from the deck. Then Mrs Kismet will explain the meaning of the cards and you will be the only one to interpret the answer to your question. If you are more inclined towards Astrology, then just put your date of birth in the calendar in front of you (on the table) and your astrology chart will be displayed and briefly explained on a daily basis if you desire. Otherwise, Mrs Kismet loves to play an ancient game called, “Royal Game of Ur” - a board game which was played in 2600 BC.  Also known as “Asseb” in ancient Egyptian times, archaeologists found it in the pharaoh, Tutankhamen’s, tomb with a tablet which partially describes how the game was played. And now you have the privilege of enjoying it with your host, Mrs Kismet. Just mind-blowing, and a very nice touch!\n\nI really like the atmosphere of the fortune-teller caravan; the cat is moving around, the discovery of the décor is superb, the cards are detailed and you can pick them up and put them close to your face and hear sounds.  A beautiful astrology chart appears in front of and around you - just magical! The desert location when playing the game of “Ur” with Egypt-Persian statues (maybe Sphynx) is great!\n\nAs I am an owner of the recommended Steam Virtual Reality headset for a couple of weeks now and own several games so far, I strongly recommend “Kismet”. To give you an idea, I decided to initiate my family with a session last night, and even my mother, who generally feels quite daunted by this type of thing, was absolutely amazed with the experience. If you have a party at home and want to introduce Virtual Reality to your guests, well do not look further, Kismet is the way to go!\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Great atmosphere\n-	Great Graphics\n-	Nice Voice over\n-	Detailed Tarot cards\n-	Daily astrology session\n-	Great for initiating people into the VR experience\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Short activities\n\n8/10\n\nKismet is a stunning VR experience! In fact, this is the first title I would choose to initiate newcomers into VR!\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

I hold a similar opinion about tarot as expressed in this thread : http://steamcommunity.com/app/463290/discussions/0/364040797995587848/. I play Kismet on a Vive.\n\nI enjoyed Kismet. It is a quirky experience with some awesome arts, great voice acting and tons of character.\nSadly the AI is pretty bad at the dice game (won on my first attempt, and despite Kismet's opinion, she wasn't even close.).\nAdditionally, the experience is slightly sub-par on the Vive, as there are practically no interactive elements. I want to pet the cat, I want to be able to manipulate stuff in Kismet's cabin. That's why the Vive comes with the wands! There is none of that, as the game seems to have been aimed primarily at Oculus Rift owners. That's too bad, as the wonderfully detailled environment really scream to be interacted with.\n\nThat being said, it is definitely worth buying (and not asking a refund just because it is more of a one-shot experience! Devs need to eat too, and there is obviously a *lot* of work that went into making Kismet), and if just to give your hippy neighbour who hates shooting robots something she will be entranced with in VR :)\n\ntl;dr : could be at a slightly lower price point for the Vive, as it doesn't take advantage of the wands at all, but overall a good buy!","May 29","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
