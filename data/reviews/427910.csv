It's a bit rough in some places, but the two-man dev team has taken this an impressive distance in a short time.\n\nIn short:This reminds me of some of the strategic flash games I used to play years ago, although in more depth. There -used- to be a cash shop which got removed when the game went to a paid model due to people criticising there being one. There was nothing exclusively available to the cash shop anyway, but kudos to the devs for taking this step (the 'second launch' was the removal of the cash shop).\n\nOne of the biggest plusses of this game are the developers themselves. They're very responsive, listen to criticism (my initial review was pretty scathing, read the comments on this review), and actively patch bugs/add features (you can see this in the discussion forums).\n\nSince you're probably already aware of what's right with the game, I'll list what's wrong. The UI could use a bit of work for user convenience still, but it still conveys the information it needs to. The graphics are decent, but in some areas a tad on the boring side, though the solo artist is working on improving them constantly. My last and largest issue is that there's nothing that truly sets this game apart from others in the genre currently, though part of this is due to it still being early access, and I've seen this being improved on steadily.\n\nFor the obligatory x/10 rating, I'd give it a 7.5/10 for it's current state. It might be worth picking up if you're into this genre, and it doesn't look like it'll be ditched any time soon given how much love the devs have put into it.\n\n=====================\nPros & Cons (w/suggestions)\n=====================\nPROS:\n+ Active & swift development (check discussions)\n+ Developers will listen to suggestions\n+ Responsible developer(s) (see also: not a cash grab)\n+ Touches on a genre that's been inactive for years, and brings some new features & ideas to the table\n+ Interesting approach to the graphics side (3D graphics)\n+ Random/Procedurally generated dungeon\n+ Complex stats/resistances, to allow for in-depth strategy\n+ Mutliple classes (with more being added)\n+ Has high score system\n+ Doesn't take a top-of-the-line system to run smoothly (fairly well optimized)\n+ Decent amount of abilities/skills/passives, with more on the way\n+ Presents a decent challenge at bosses, and each boss has a gimmick\n\nCONS:\n- Controls are not intuitive (they can be rebound though)\n- Unwieldy UI at times\n- Could use more music/sounds\n- Not much lore currently\n- Maximum level limited to 50 due to current content (subject to change)\n\nPOSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS\n= Show mana/hp regen amount in stats\n= Add an easily viewable EXP meter with the HP/MP meters in the portrait frame area.\n= Lore, lore, lore\n= Ability to select race at world generation\n= Use of color and images in text for combat log -- red for damage, green for health regened, some sort of image to indicate the event (like the image associated with the skill used)\n= Floor curses/blessings\n= Add a boss room map icon\n= Make it possible to compare 1h weapons to 2h weapons\n= Make it possible to compare a ring to both currently equipped rings (simultaneously)","March 11","true","52.0"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","25","31","3","11"

My only real issues are with the music and the amount of enemy encounters.\n\nPros:\n\n+Very well made, they included things I thought they might not such as where you place your party for engagements and a pretty enjoyable loot system. I've found some pretty strong starter weapons and armors so I can pretty easily take down the enemies I'm encountering.\n\n+The game doesn't seem to require much of your PC in order to play so I feel like anyone who is into first person dungeon crawlers but can't afford a better rig to play some of the more high-end ones will enjoy this.\n\n+They added footfalls into the sound pool. While they do sound rather 90's, I don't mind that. It fits with the era that this game seems to be in. It feels like a very 90's game, and it feels great. I really do like that about this game.\n\nCons:\n\n- The music is literally the same song throughout the whole game with no pause even during loading screens. It's a nice song but I feel like that should be the song that plays in town and there should be a separate song that plays during dungeon crawling (or no song at all, for more atmosphere).\n\n- Probably my only gripe (it's more of a personal one) is the amount of enemies you encounter. When you open a door, it's either a group of enemies, a lore book, or a chest. 80% of the time it's enemies. It doesn't matter much and I feel like I'd enjoy this system more if I kept playing, but it's just a personal gripe. Keep it in, I'll get used to it. Especially if there's ambient noise to accompany my time spent in the dungeon.\n\n\nThis is a free game so there are some paid elements but I don't feel like you NEED to spend money on this game to do well. I've been doing pretty good so far without seeing any reason to spend money on the game, but someone might find something as I haven't played very much. I'd say give this game a try right now. If it's not your cup of tea, try it in a couple months after some patches roll out and the game becomes better. I really do like this game, it's a lot of fun and the developers listen to feedback from the community. If you like developer inclusion and 90's first person dungeon crawlers, download this game.","March 11","true","0.7"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","24","31","0","3"

I am enjoying the game and I haven't lost a character yet, there is absolutely no need for the gems / ingame currency.  This game is fully playable without spending, I want to make that perfectly clear, this is NOT a money grab.\n\nIt is a wonderfully constructed old school RPG that will find a slot in your day when you want to hit some baddies with your crew of bearded ladies and hunched over old cronies tossing fireballs and smiting your foes !\n\nEach floor will give you the opportunity to return back to town or climb the next level, but once you go up, you must reach the next level of stairs to go back, so do not make that decision lightly, and you'll love this game.

My only major qualms with it are its single looping song, and its slight over-abundance of enemy encounters. I think it could also use a consumable item or two, to bring along with the party into the tower. Since the shrines cover healing, perhaps the items could increase the likelihood of finding a shrine or some such.\nThe lore books are a great touch, the healing shrines are wonderful in a pickle, and the chests are great for getting much-needed gear.

I have enjoyed what I have played so far, From the loot based upgrades, unforgiving combat and charming, if basic visuals.  The hub world, or town and cash shop gives me pretty heavy mobile vibes, but if you can get past it I feel the gameplay is more than decent.\n\nTo start you get four party members you can chose from four classes for each of them, warrior, priest, rogue, and mage.  Each class has a variety of uses in combat, but each fills a standard roll, warriors generally make the best tanks, mages do tons of ranged dps, etc. You're members are arranged on a two by six grid, and each member attacks in sequence with all other party members or enemies in the current room of the dungeon. Each turn usually goes by quick, so even though combat is turn based it can move pretty fast.\n\nHonestly from what I have played there is not a whole lot more to it than that. Zavix Tower is currently in early access so I expect to see at least some changes at some point. but on the off chance that we don't I still think its pretty neat and would recommend you try it if you are looking for a free to play dungeon crawler.","March 18","true","3.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Characters are customizable (personally something I absolutely love/need in games) and the graphics are very pleasing and interesting. The combat is incredibly intuitive and challenging, forcing you to think ahead and about each and every turn you make. Yet the progression in the tower is not impossible, I always feel as though I'm constantly getting upgrades and making lots of progress. The in-game shop is there and available but I don't feel like it is necessity as everyone seems to make it out to be and everything seems to be available and possible just by playing and being smart about your decision making.\n\nNo game is perfect though and there are elements that are obviously in need of fine-tuning and changing. For one, at the moment there is not much variety for music choice. Also there isn't much explanation, or lore, in the begining to help players to ease into the game. This is clear to everyone else, and possibly the developers as well, but I'm more then sure this will change in the near future.\n\nAgain, everything is still in early access and the game is not anywhere near completion. I would more than recommend at least checking it out as it is free to play since there's nothing to lose!","March 17","true","9.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The game is by no means finished, so if your looking for a finished AAA quality game then you probably will need to wait a bit.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty darn good, with more mobs and bosses being added. The item system is still be bit generic, but its solid none the less. Graphics have been coming up steadily, and so have the features. I love that I have been able to play the whole time without spending any more (though the starter pack the just put up is very temping).\n\noverall its a good skeleton of a game, and its headed in the right direction.","March 11","true","10.2"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

Every one of them played 3+ hours their first session.\n\nThis game has an amazing start to be something great. The characters grow on you as you play and build into their strengths. I find myself getting more and more attaached to each character as I play. Some of these games force you to swap out characters for arbitrary reasons and they usually loose me there.\n\nItems seem really well done even in the beginning. I always feel like I am getting minor upgrades as I progress.\n\nI LOVE that alot of in game purchaces can be earned with in game currency. Do your daillies so that you can earn crystals and getting unlocks.\n\nBattle is very intuitive and all of the data I need seems to be at your finger tips if you take the few seconds to look for it.\n\nKeep up the good work on this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sylek/recommended/427910/","Sylek","Sylek Isana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sylek/","5 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAfter reading several reviews on Steam for this game, I can say that I like these devs a lot. I'm going to try to remember to update this review as I play more and the game gets updated, but no promises. I am definitely playing more though. I'm also going to try to give details on gameplay, instead of a blanketed "I like this game."\nFirst, I'm going to say that a lot of the negative reviews are for one of two things.\n1) The reviewer saw that the game has microtransactions. (More on that later).\n2) The reviewer rushed into the game blindly, did poorly, and blames the devs.\nIf you take your time with this game, you'll be rewarded by dying less.\n\n=Pros=\n+Characters: When you start the game, you get to customize four characters using four classes (Warrior, Rogue, Mage, Cleric), spend stat points, name them, etc. I started with one of each class, but if you really wanted to, you could use all Warriors.\n+Formation: Your party can be arranged in two rows (front and back) of three slots. The center slots for each row are 'Tanks', and the front row is for melee while the back row is for ranged. After reading some reviews, I felt I should mention that.\n+Randomization: The tower's layout and rooms are randomized each time you enter. In short, the tower is never the same in any two runs.\n+Runes: Runes are seen on some doors in the tower and change combat for their room. So far, I've seen physical damage+, physical damage-, magical damage+, and magical damage-. These runes are visible both before and after you open the door, but not all doors have a rune. I'd love to see what other runes are added and how they'll change the battles.\n+Daily Quests: There's a daily quest available that awards gold and a few crystals. My first daily quest was to kill 50 monsters (any enemy) and got a few crystals and some gold for it. This is a really easy way to get free crystals. I've done another daily quest: Clear 3 floors. The daily quests reward you for playing the game.\n\n=Cons=\n-Repetitive: Right now, the game is a little repetitive, but it's also still a work in progress. It's also an RPG, and I can think of some repetitive parts of Final Fantasy and other bigger names.\n-Text: Some of the text in tabs or buttons is hard to read, but I've read that the devs are already working on this. In addition, you can still open those tabs and get an idea of what it says from the contents and buttons have tool tips when you hover the mouse over them. Right now, it's merely an inconvenience. (I've been playing with the game windowed).\n-The town: The town is too open in my opinion. It's also the only point where I can see the game as a mobile game. I can live with the town as it is, as it doesn't have very much effect on gameplay. The only time I'm in the town is when I'm not in a shop or the tower.\n\n=Other=\n*Microtransactions: While there is a cash shop in game, I have seen no reason to use it. The only thing I have seen that you can't use gold for is re-allocating skill points and even then there is a free mehod to getting the necessary few crystals. The only advantage to crystals over gold is that things are cheaper. Unless you have some money to spend and you want to support the devs, you can completely ignore the microtransactions, as I will be (sorry devs, but my money is being sent elsewhere).\n*Recruitment: You start with 7 character slots (seen in the inn) and 4 characters. I have found two ways of getting new characters, but have not used either. The first and main way is to buy them in town. Alternatively, if you're lucky, you can find a new party member at the end of a floor instead of loot (I foolishly passed this up).\n*Skills: New skills are learned in town for a fee (gold only). You also have to open a menu to hotkey the new skills manually, but there's no mention of this in game yet. Skill points gained each level buff these skills. I noticed that the Warrior can put points into Bash, and Cleric into Smite, even before learning these skills. Additionally, there's no mention of what skills are passive or active when allocating skill points.\n*Revive: When your party falls in the tower, you retreat and one of your characters needs to be revived. It cost me 50x the character's level and my warrior had none of his equipment, but still had enough gold to revive him, buy some new equipment, and buy my rogue's next ability (100 gold).\n*Hallways: When I first played, there were no hallways, just room upon room. The hallways expand the tower and contribute to a feel of actually exploring the tower. There are no dead ends to the hallways, however. They always lead to a door.\n*Locked Doors: Some doors in the tower are locked and you can find a key from some battles. I haven't seen a visual difference between normal doors and locked doors, and you have to drag the key from your inventory onto the door to use it.\n\nThis game is in Early Access, but I'd still give it an 8/10 for now. I'm looking forward to seeing how the game progresses as the devs have already given the game great potential.\n\nNote: I think I may have found a bug when buying a skill. When going to buy skills, the menu opened up to Cleric skills and I tried to buy Smite. I was charged for the skill but did not get it until I clicked my Cleric and then purchased the skill (being charged again). I'm not overly concerned about the 100 gold, but this could be a big concern with later skills that cost more.\n\nEdit: Fell in combat, so got to add reviving characters. Made more progress in the tower. My opinion on the hallways and locked doors.","March 21","true","2.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Unfortunately, it appears to be designed as a requiring microtransactions to make any real progress. Documentation is lacking (tutorial hasn't been created yet, but is promised; there is no manual to explain which key does what; some routine things in othergames don't happen here - eg can only heal or regain mana in combat.)\n\nWhen you go into the dungeon there is only 1 way out (other than every 5th level - maybe, I never got that far) - and that is through the morgue. Unfortuantely, characters cost 100x level gold to revive, while with a starting party you can expect to have to clear 15 to 20 rooms of monsters to earn 100 gold. Sadly your mana and health will likely run out in about one third that many rooms (or less if you run into higher level monsters...) meaning you are only going backwards unless you buy gold or crystals to revive dead characters...\n\nIf there was an alternative to yes and no, I'd choose it. The game is still in early access, so it may well change before final release. I'll try again at that time and update my review afterwards.","March 14","false","1.4"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","3"

In the town you have a Chapel (To revive lost party members), an Inn (To add armor and to alter characters), a Blacksmith(To buy/sell), and a "Dojo" (To get new spells or abilities for your character). You have the right to change a characters abilities, armor, looks, and thier attributes. Doing so will improve thier stats and your chance in the dungeon tower.\n\nYour main objective is to survive as long as possible in the dungeon tower. In it you will encounter rabid wolves,slimes, the occasional succubus, goblins, ect.\n\nThe combat system is quite simple. You set your party up for who's infront and who's behind. You click on the desired attack or magic spell and it swings at the monster. You, of course, have to watch your mana and your health while maintaining the monsters at hand.\n\nIn the dungeon tower you can find chests which contain common to epic items. The map is a little hectic and I've gotten lost inside of the dungeon tower.\n\nDying in the dungeon tower makes a character lose items and xp that could've been gained. The higher the level, the bigger risk and better the reward is.\n\nF2P:\nYou can get upgrades. They are for town upgrades, more bag space, buying more characters, or respec'ing your character's abilities/attributes. PAYING FOR SHARDS DOES NOT EFFECT COMBAT. (Aka your strength does not depend on how much money you spend) All of these can be earned so it's not a P2W game even though there is grinding involved.\n\nImprovements and thoughts:\n\nThe map system and control system inside the dungeon tower needs to be worked. I demand arrows and a little blip to help me find my way out. I'm not currently impressed with the combat system, but I have been told a lot more characters are coming out to widen the variety. I hope that the DEV's also place in dungeon rooms such as traps, a mana fountain, maybe some characters who heal/talk to you. It's a skeleton currently and it's not a terrible idea. If anything, it reminds me of my early Ps1 days.\n\nKeep on improving the good work. Hope you like my review.","March 23","true","2.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Zavix Tower needs work but it is addictive and fun! Though it's a bit buggy and the interface/controls take a little bit to get used to, the game is really entertaining after that point. It feels like a true dungeon-crawler RPG, and I'd definitely recommend it, however only to those who are open minded to those who don't mind taking their time to understand undefined mechanics; this is not a finished game.\n\nP.S. The guides section will help you find helpful information while you play. This guide by DEETS is a wonderful and in-depth guide that I'd highly recommend checking out while you play.\n\nPros:\n+fun, addictive gameplay\n+pretty good graphics\n+skill tree\n+upgradeable attributes\n+hours of gameplay\n+nostalgic RPG feeling\n+customizable team/characters\n\nCons:\n-confusing controls/mechanics\n-occasional crashes\n-sounds are basic and unappealing","March 12","true","4.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

I've played every American Wizardry game and many of the Japanese ones.  I've played the old school Bard's Tales and Might & Magic games.  I say that so as to give you perspective on my review.\n\nVisuals: These are always hit or miss for me.  I have a growing dislike of 'photo-realistic' graphics in games, so the slightly old-school/cartoony feel of the graphics is just about right for me in a 3D game.  Some of the animation is a little rough, but not in any way that detracts from the game for me. 4/5\n\nGameplay: For the most part this game is what I long for in a simple, old school dungeon crawler.  Explore the dungeon(Tower), kill bad guys, get loot.  There are, however, some downsides.  These, mostly, are centered around the free-to-play aspects.  For instance, inability to create a full party from the start, having to buy more bag space, etc.  These are not deal breakers, but they go to a trend in gaming that I don't like, false dificulty.  Challenge me with gameplay, not pay walls.  That said, those things haven't yet become game breaking or deal breaking, and can also be purchased with the in-game gold, which is a nice option for those of us that don't want to pay for micro transactions. Another thing I miss/haven't encountered are puzzles, secret doors, or some of the other standard Dungeon Crawl tropes.  If they are in the game, i just haven't found them yet, otherwise, i think the game misses out on something. I give it a tentative 3/5, 4/5 if the microtransactions remain unneeded to progress in the game.\n\nMusic/audio: I just stopped playing a few minutes ago, and I can't recall either the music or sound effects.  That could be because they aren't memorable or because the only thing I can hear is the sound of my sick elderly cat wheeze/snoring beside me.  ?/5 until I can play without the old windbag next to me.\n\nOverall: The game is great fun, but definately has the Early Access feeling of an unpolished game.  That isn't bad, it means they're doing it the right way, still working, and constant updates are flowing.  As long as the devs keep doing what they're doing, i'm sure the game will keep getting better.  Keep up the good work, Devs, and i'll keep playing.\n\nThe only suggestion/request I can make would be to offer a version that we can pay for, that removes the microtransactions.  It is easier for me to justify a one time payment of 10, 20, 30, or 40 then an indefinate amount on a game currency.","April 14","true","3.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","2"

It fills a niche that hasn't been scratched since the 90's. A simple, fun, play at your pace, rpg-style, flash, dungeon crawler. Reminiscent of Bards Tale.\n\nYou will not need spreed sheets for economy, crafting recipes, or vast inventory spaces for hoarding every item you ever looted from a bandit. You ~will~ need to plan your stats, smacks, and strats!\n-It matters where you allocate those attribute points per level.\n-Also what enemy you target, and when.\n-As well as how you budget mana and maintain health(especially on a boss level).\n\nThe devs & community are in that newlywed phase. So they are active with quick daily responses to work out kinks and explore it's direction.\nIt's a nice addition to anyones library fond of the genre. And if you like bieng envoled with and playing the early development release phase of games.\n\nIt's free with a cash shop. There are two currencies:\n1) your standard Gold that's droped from mobs, selling loot & earned via daily quest\n2) blue shard things bought with real money &/or earned via daily quest\nThey are both used to buy the same things, and you can earn both in game. So playing fully for free applies here.\nNo red flags or walls with the cash shop, it's just used to upgrade the town quicker/support the devs.","March 31","true","135.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Because the game is free you can give it a try and then decide yourself if you like it or not.\n\nNow to the "main dish" (even though I am not good in writting reviews)Zavix Tower brings the "old school" board games into first prespective view of player by controlling your characters in this RPG game style, with loot, characters stats and confronting bosses (as you walking towards higher tower floors) included.\n\nThe game is a little "hardcore" meaning that if your whole party is wipped out then your characters will lose their equiped gears but when you ressurect 1 character you will get 3 of lost gears back (I think as I haven't lost my party yet ^_^" it is what I read).\n\nAs for the microtransactions that many players are mentioning in their reviews, it is there only to make your game more "relaxed" (to easily upgrade your inventory, town and for character ressurection even though gold you can farm for it or by doing daily quest as also shards which in case you need to purchase more shards there is a button in your inventory box) and to be able to fund the development team (not that they want to be funded as they have mentioned in a post), there isn't anything there to make you OP as there isn't any PvP in the game.\n\nThere is also a "Starter Pack" that costs $1.99 (I think it was 1.78 Euro) which will give you a little help (if you want) to start your adventures but only is enabled for purchase for 24 hours and then it will go away or when your purchase it.\n\nEdit: Just to add that there is a daily quest that gives you as reward (except of gold) some shards too (not much), so if you don't want to buy any then you can do daily quests to get them.\n\nBe informed that the game is still in EA which means that you will find few bugs here and there but not game breaking bugs (haven't seen any game breaking for myself) and also many stuff are coming in the future updates.\n\nNot to forget something crucial here, the devs are easily reachable and talkable in game's forum and have a good contact with players.\n\nI will use the "recommended" icon as  a "thumb up" because I like the game and enjoy it and not as recommending to players which for that it is upto you to make your own choice.","March 14","true","19.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","4"

The battlelog\nNeeds to be a tick smaller and if possible in a small black box so you can see the text better.\n\n2. The loot system:\nFor RNG the loot is very well done, the only thing that bugs me is that nearly everything you collect has no real value.\nYou guys should increase the vcalues of items because once I equiped my guys with good loot I just discarded my old stuff instead of selling it.\n\n3. Locked doors:\nHaving a small window pop up to decide if you want to open it or not makes it a bit more comfortable instead of going into the inventory and drag and drop the key onto the door.\n\n4.

The first thing I did when I got in after creating my party of course was look in the real money shop because you know there will be one. It does look like this will have an element of pay to win, how bad it will be I do not know but take that as you will, you can purchase party slots and other things that are clearly benificial to get. The combat is pretty basic but it does look like I could get complicated in the later levels in a good way. The music is absolutly terrible same song over and over and over and it does not match. There does seem to be a story but you will have to look for it on each floor from the looks of things.

The game itself, in spite of its simplicity, scratches the right itch for quick-access RPG elements when you don't have time to navigate a 3D worldspace to get to your objective. When my rogue got one-shotted on the first floor, stuff got real. The turn-based combat is challenging, and makes you appreciate every single hp. This game certainly deserves a place in its niche.\n\nUpon perusing the in-game cash shop, you'll find the standard slate of $1.99 to $59.99 gem packages that we've all come to loathe. Nothing kills an RPG chubby faster than an in-game cash shop. It breaks immersion every time I have to employ my self-discipline to deny myself the luxuries of bag space, rezzing my heroes, hiring new ones, etc. However, if you can shrug off the temptation, you'll probably love this game.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/XHTId\n\nFor PC, there are quite a few titles out there that can deliver a similar experience, minus the cash-grab. If you need a good game for a low-end PC, Forgotten Realms' Baldur's Gate comes to mind, which has even been improved upon as the genre has matured.\n\nTo the devs: You're on to something potentially amazing. A clean RPG experience will always have an eager market. FTL and Terraria (BtP) are amazing, timeless games because every player stands on equal ground. Please drop the microtransactions, put a price on your hard work, and rebalance the cash shop rewards into the game as part of its progression. With your current monetization strategy, I can't recommend this title to anyone I know.\n\n\n************************************************************\n************************************************************\nEdit:\n\nI've been informed that the cash shop will be shut down, and the game will be released as a paid title. This is a terrific decision - the traditional monetization model is one that we can all get behind without feeling guilty about impulsive purchasing. Game was free the first time, and I will gladly buy again upon release.","March 15","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","9"

The Concept is the tried and true formula of dungeon crawling but the execution leaves a bit to be desired.\n\nMy main issue is the loot mechanic, if you get a reward after a battle or after a floor clear, you have to make sure you drag each individual item into your backpack one by one to collect the reward. For the first few battles,and even on the floor clear loot, I was clicking the 'ok' button thinking it was putting the loot in my pack, after I cleared the first floor I went back to town to check my spoils. Apparently clicking OK, without dragging each individual item over, makes the loot vanish into thin air, you cannot recover any loot lost this way, it doesn't fall into a pile to pick up later it just goes away.\n\nThe lighting on the models is very simple, it would be decent quality as a mobile game but on PC I would expect a little more polish and care put into the models so the light looked good on them rather than blocky or dark.\n\nSound is simple enough, basic slashing sounds and such.\n\nOverall this game may shape up to be a good time waster in the future, but with some mechanics that are fiddly at best and not non-gamer friendly at worst, you may want to let this wait in the oven for a bit longer while they work on polish.","March 13","true","0.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","5"

Simplistic dungeon crawler with ugly art, lackluster music, and some uninteresting sound effects. No charm, no wonder, the structure is very rigid and predictable, if there are any puzzles in it, I pray they are more interesting than the combat and exploration. There was hardly any discovery to be had, and combat was in almost every room. Misses the point of being a dungeon crawler\n\nGame encourages microtransactions, not mandatory, but not a good sign for a free game of this caliber either. Not going to pay in microtransactions for a game that doesn't grab me, to hope that this money will make the game better in the future is foolishness.\n\nThere are many dungeon crawlers out there that are better than this one, most if not all much older too.

So here it goes.\nTried it, and become attached easily. Thats because im a maniac in RPG games in general.\nBut I dont think I can recommend this game for now. Why? The punishment is so severe when your party is annihilated. after all party member is killed, returning to town found out all gears in the inventory AND equipped to my active party members that i obtained is gone. Furthermore I have to spend in-game gold to revive the main character. I personally dont like that kind of punishment. I know its F2P, but, really? Thats how you treat your clients?\n\nThere's a possible workaround for the penalty. My suggestions :\n+ Experience penalty.\n+ in-game gold deduction according to deaths at certain floor.\n+ dailies deduction.\n\nbut please, not deleting the whole gears in the inventory. For now im giving it a forced thumbs down. Ill probably return to this game, if the penalty is being lifted.\n\n\n(Edit)\n1 bug detected while playing.\nwhile i was changing of a greater gear of the main character (dont remember what it is, chest or belt maybe) the health was deducted by one. I thought it was because of the low stat, but when i re-equipped the old one, still deducted by one. when i repeatedly changing of the 2 gear, the health is deducted until 0 but the char is still alive (happened in the dungeon)","March 13","false","2.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","3"

True you can technically play it without spending anything, but it's not really worth it when you consider how limited you are upon starting a new game and the fact that each "upgrade" to the town or your inventory space increases in cost, starting at 25 shards for the first one and 50 shards for the second in each category. I've not bought any upgrades so I'm not sure if it increases by 25 each time or increases by an order of magnitude.\n\n16 inventory slots to start with, which you will most likely fill up in the first floor of the dungeon, since you start at floor one on entering it means you'll have to skip a lot of loot. Not TOO terrible when most of the loot on the first few floors sells for less than 10 gp each unless it's a magical item and it's best to just skip even picking it up if you're planning on moving to other floors, but you'll soon find yourself having to stop after each fight to pick and choose what to discard and to pick up. Sure, you could spend shards to upgrade your inventory by 4 slots per upgrade but why is it such a piddly amount of spaces to begin with?\n\nOne of the selling points of the game is a "persistant upgradeable town", but the "upgrades" only address the sad state of each building instead of adding something meaningful to them. Starting off the Blacksmith restocks 4 items each time you finish a romp in the tower and the Tavern has one recruit available each refresh. But, hey! You can spend shards to upgrade them! Awesome. It also costs gold or shards to recruit more characters beyond the initial 4. I can't recall ever having to pay to recruit other adventurers in any other dungeon crawler that I've played.\n\nThe true oldschool dungeon crawlers like Bard's Tale and the Wizardry games have fully functional towns, so why doesn't this one? Because it's "free"? Is it really "free" if you have to shell out cash to "build" the town from what is apparently a backwater hovel?\n\nAvoid, there are much better dungeon crawlers out there that don't try to milk you for money.","April 29","false","2.0"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","8"
