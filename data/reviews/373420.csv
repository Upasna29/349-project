You start out with an already fantastic game that's received numerous game of the year and editor's choice awards. Then you spend a year polishing that game, and adding new features. The result is brilliant Enhanced Edtion of an already fantastic game.\n\nNew features for EE:\nFully voice acted - Every line of dialog now has voice acting. The voice acting is really good too\nDual wield - Rogues now look more iconic with the ability to dual wield\nGrenades - You can craft and throw various sorts of grenades.\nTactician Mode - A new  challenging mode where encounters are redesigned to be harder by adding new spells and enemies into the mix. Classic mode still available obviously.\nSplit screen co-op\nController support\nUpdated graphics - The UI is totally reworked, the graphics are updated, and spells have new effects\nUpdates to the story  - The story, esepcially the ending, was rewritten a bit to clear up some confusing aspects\nI'm sure there's more, but really these ought to be reason enough to play this game.","October 27, 2015","true","30.4"," 914 of 956 people (96%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","96","914","956","22","18"

The negative aspects of it are more a matter of taste rather than being poor game design. Since so many negative reviews are written by people who think the game's too slow, I'll give a fast review so that you'll have time to play it sooner.\n\nPros:\n- Great game design.\n- Beautifully crafted world with a competent graphics engine.\n- Great soundtrack.\n- Combat is highly tactical and multifaceted. Planning and having a variety of strategies matter. (I recommend playing on Tactician Mode)\n- Profound character creation, that actually matters in gameplay.\n- Dialogue choices (sometimes) matter and help build character traits.\n- Humour and pop-culture references.\n- Lots of secrets.\n\nMatters of taste:\n- Very unforgiving to: Inexperienced RPG-players. Unskilled tacticians. People with bad dice rolls. Those who can't properly use Google as a last life-line. People who bought a keyboard without the F5 and F9 buttons. Sufferers of amnesia.\n- Slow, sometimes painfully slow. A beverage or friend to accompany you through some parts of the game is highly recommended.\n- A bit too few "in combat" tracks.\n- Arhu is ♥♥♥♥ing everywhere.\n\nCons:\n- Repetitive character auto-reactions to world effects. ("Feeling a bit hot under the collar!" "On the mend!" "What a deluge!" etcetera)\n- Unnecessarily slow animations and queuing outside of combat.\n- A little too uninformative quest log.\n- Some quests/parts of quests are downright uninteresting.\n- As with any game of any publisher, a few bugs here and there.","December 4, 2015","true","49.1"," 502 of 521 people (96%) found this review helpful 68 people found this review funny","96","502","521","68","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HardRenaLine/recommended/373420/","HardRenaLine","Hardy P","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HardRenaLine/","196 products in account","This is a review/list of a 2 player Co-op experience (not split-screen) of the Enhanced Edition (without mods) played around a month after the release without any prior experience of any Divinity game. We played the entire game with keyboard and mouse on both computers.\n\nCharacter creation, roleplaying, exploration and story.+ The characters are shaped during the travels allowing you to diverge (if you want) from the class you created at the start.\n+ Reading books, letters and listening to NPCs reward the players taking their time doing those kinds of things.\n+ LOADS of side-quests with varying components such as VIP-escort, bosses, storylines for your mercenaries, puzzle solving and rollplaying (duh!).\n+ There's voice acting for (almost) all the dialogues in the game.\n+ (Co-op only) You and your Co-op friend may disagree on matters in the story and this will change your characters traits in different ways, giving you different bonuses based on what you reply.\n+ (Optional) The Tactician Mode offers a fun and innovative harder playthrough where the enemies have new tricks up their sleeves.\n+ (Optional) The Honour Mode = Permadeath + Tactician Mode combined. No resurrection scrolls, saves over your one and only saveslot when someone in your party dies and deletes your save if both your main characters die.\n~ The Puzzle elements in the game can both be fun and frustrating at times.\n~ We didn't even use half of the spells in the game, yet somehow we felt like there were spell classes not even present in the game.\n- Keys/arrows/books will clutter up your inventory and it's hard to keep track on what to keep/throw so you might end up keeping them all in a bag. Maybe a keychain & a quiver would be an alternative.\n- Renaming/customizing bags so that you can identify what is inside without opening it would be a nice addition.\n- Got stuck HARD on one of the quests due to the way we wanted to play. Minor spoiler warning. "The Councillor's Wife"-quest forces you to break in and steal things. We were trying to play without stealing/breaking in anywhere, but it seems to be the only way you can do it.\nCombat.+ The elemental system offers alot of options in fights, puzzles and character development.\n+ Enemy encounters feel challenging throughout the entire game.\n+ A large variety of enemies to encounter. (which gets even better in Tactician Mode!!)\n+ Being able to sort your spells and action items into 5 different "hot-bars" is a life saver later on.\n- Selecting enemies during fights can be a pain because you might miss them due to their animations.\n- From time to time the enemies and other NPCs don't know what to do during a fight so they just stand around and skip their turn after ~10 seconds.\nHow does it look? What does it sound like?+ The massive 7 hour soundtrack was one of the biggest surprises for us, it is very enjoyable.\n+ Refreshing environments in contrast to many games that go for the gloomy look.\n+ It's easy to see what is going on when you're in combat or out adventuring.\n+ A smart system that makes things see-through where your characters are.\n+ Great and easy to use camera controls.\n- The cinematics could use a visual overhaul.\n- A few times in the game uninvolved NPCs won't shut when you are fighting.\nOptions and performance.+ We didn't experience a single software-crash during the entire game!\n+ The option menu included everything that we wanted to change, including a sound mixer with the following sliders available: FX/Music/Ambient/Voice/Cinematics and Master.\n+ Has built-in support for mods. However, there aren't that many mods available at the time of writing.\n+ Includes a variant of borderless fullscreen called "Fake Fullscreen". Jumping in and out of the game is as fast as you'd expect from a borderless feature, but it will minimize as soon as you're clicking on something outside the game.\n- The top part of the UI doesn't show the correct values such as your health, the turn order and which buffs/debuffs you and your enemies have been exposed to.\n- Both of us experienced sound problems in certain areas of the game: King Boreas' treasury and right outside Icara's Ice Prison.\n- (Co-op only)Sometimes the game won't show (or even load) the same data for both players.\nExamples: The second player won't see the correct animations, what gear anyone is wearing, your stats might go back to 5 on each point and/or it will show you that you don't have full health even though you do.\nThe Verdict.\n9/10A fantastic co-op game that makes you look at the clock and say: "woah, have we really been playing this for 8 hours straight?" and then play some more.\nGreat value, it really had everything we were looking for and more.\nThe only reason not to get this must-have-game is if you're an impatient person.","January 3","true","111.9"," 171 of 176 people (97%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","97","171","176","14","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/373420/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Divinity: Original Sin is a roleplaying game developed by Larian Studios. The game was also partially funded through Kickstarter. This enhanced edition of the game was released in October 2015 for PC, PS4 and Xbox One. It came as a free upgrade for everyone that owned the original game which was released in June 2014.\n\nGameplay in Original Sin follows a very classic RPG style of play. You control two heroes, and you take part in battles which are turn-based combat.  The game play is very tactical, and some fights can last up to about forty five minutes at times. Positioning, making sure you use potions and spells at the optimal moment all play a key role to success in Original Sin. The combat system can be considered to be slow paced, but I personally enjoyed the tactical thought you have to put into every action you take. The game’s tutorial system at the start of the game is done very well, and introduces all elements of gameplay in a satisfying manner.  A lot of the game is based in dialogue as well; I will say this now, if you aren’t one for reading masses amount of text (or listening to), then you will probably want to avoid playing this game, as there is a boat load of text and dialogue to be found here. There are times when you get to make key choices in the dialogue scenes, and also offers branches to find out more information about lore and plot as well.  Overall, the gameplay is really well done, and if you want to find a game that you can absolutely get completely lost in its gameplay, then you should stop here and just pick it up.\n\nGraphically, Original Sin looks gorgeous. The enhanced version of the game improved the graphics quite a bit over the original release, and how managed to reduce the install size. The colourful environments and lush greenery just look amazing. This is one of the best looking games I have played in a very long while. The animations of all characters is done very well too; never did I see any janky looking movements or action, which helped at keeping me fully immersed in the beautiful world.\n\nAs with all RPG games, the story is crucial to the reception it gets. Original Sin does not disappoint here either. On top of the games over arching main story line, you also have the chance to branch off into other lesser side plots which can sometimes make you forget all about the rest of the game as they are so in depth. The side quests in this game would probably be main stories in another; that is how good the plot behind Original Sin is. You will of course have to be up for reading the text if you want to get the full effect out of it though.\n\nThe majority of Original Sin is voice acted – this helps a lot given the amount of text in the game, but there are parts, which are sometimes quite randomly selected, which aren’t voice acted. This is where you will need the patience to continue reading the dialogue to fully understand what is happening in the world. The sound effects and soundtrack are really good too; nothing seemed out of place so it fits in well with the game.\n\nI found the game to be fairly tricky, I had never played the classic RPG games, I was just too young to understand them, and so I felt as if this game took me on a crash course of learning about them. I have to admit, I did have to use wiki’s and FAQs at times to progress and work out how best to tackle a few bosses; but that should be taken as part and parcel of the gaming experience with something of this size. Researching the best action to take for me makes the game all that more fun.\n\nThe world in which this game is set in, feels so alive and active. When you are in towns you can hear plenty of market sellers in the background selling their goods, you can find countless amounts of side quests, and plenty of items to interact with and loot. If you are looking for a game with almost perfect level design, look no further.\n\nIn total, this game took me about 54 hours to complete, this was with doing as many side quests as I could find and listening/reading to all the dialogue in the game as well – that is on single player. Where Original Sin gets above other games of its type, is that you can also play the game in co-op mode as well; that alone means you can probably hit the triple figures for the amount of hours on offer in this game.  There is an absurd amount of content to see.\n\nSince this is the enhanced edition of the game, I didn’t find any technical issues. The game runs like a dream on 4k resolutions. Loading times are almost none existent as well. Like I said above, they have somehow managed to get the install size down on the game as well, which is something of a mystery given the amount of improvements they have added/changed. .\n\nTo sum up, Divinity: Original Sin is an absolute masterpiece of a game. The gameplay whilst slow paced is so well done, it will keep you interested and wanting more after you first battle. The plot is one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of seeing in any video game, and one that I will remember for a very long time. On top of all this, you the amount of content on offer is amazing. I cannot recommend Divinity Original Sin enough, even if you aren’t a massive fan of the RPG genre, this could be the game that changes that opinion for you.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198074675516/recommended/373420/","76561198074675516","Valmar","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198074675516/","580 products in account","I can not tell you properly with words how good this game is.\n\nI will try however and I should start, as everyone, comparing it to old school RPG titles. Unlike recent RPG-called titles from this century —mostly made for the new generations of players, with little or no brains needed at all to solve quests—, Divinity: Original Sin looks like a true role playing game reminiscent of the old ages but with very cool new ideas —some of them unique— and fresh graphics.\n\nThe main characteristic, typical of Larian games, is the freedom to do almost everything you want: the game is classless, so you can choose a warrior in the beginning and later on you can change your mind and provide him with some spells or range skills, if you like it, when he level up; this way you will end up with four characters, two of them from the start and two more later on, with a combination of skills, traits and talents that fits you. You can interact with almost every item in the game: doors, chests, barrels, pictures, chairs, etc, and you can open them to look inside or destroy them if you prefer, or even take them and move them from one place to another. You can also choose if you prefer to talk to every NPC and solve quests, trade with them, or killing them if you like it, or even steal their items and loot their houses. Every action will make the villagers approach you in different ways, turning hostile to you or being polite instead. And if you don't like to trade with NPCs a lot you are able to craft your own gear and even spells if you choose to do it with the immense amount of ingredients and tools you will find everywhere.\n\nWhat makes this game unique, and a gem, is a combination of the role playing part with the interaction between characters —even yours!— and its combat system. Divinity is not a combat focused game, it is more a conversational and exploration RPG title; however, combat is also very important and this is not a real time one, it is a turn-based combat system with action points mechanics that forces you to think about your resources, the enemies, and the environment; so each turn you can use your points to move, drink potions, attack or cast spells if you got enough points for them, or if you prefer you can reserve some of your remaining action points for your next turn, for example if you want to wait when the enemy is far away from you and later on you want to hit him two or three times in the same turn. The best part of the system is, no doubt, the chance —and mostly the need— of using the elements on your favour. It means you can cast a rain spell on your characters to stop them from burning; you can also cast rain on enemies, make them wet and then cast electricity spells for extra damage and stuns. You can also use ice spells if enemies are wet —state than come from your spells or from real rain itself!— to freeze them. You can shoot (after throwing it for example) an oil barrel with a fire spell to make it explode and damage the area, or just hit it with your arrows to make it pour the oil and later on cast fire on it if you wish. You can make an ice barrier to protect, wait until enemies are near it and then fire it, making it water and causing enemies to stumble, and then electrify them. You can combine elements to create clouds to avoid being a target. You can stealth and stab enemies too if you have the right character to do such a thing. You can use barrels and things of the environment to take cover, to protect you and to avoid damage. You can also try to flee if you find the situation too chaotic for your taste. You can... well, you can —and you should— do all these things if you want to survive, because combat is not always an easy task on this game.\n\nFor all these things I must say this is a heck of a game; I have not THAT fun with a videogame probably since some decades (I'm absolutely for real here). It's also true that there are some things that are not optimal and need improvement. Among the negatives, there is the camera movement, the slow pace of the game sometimes when you need to go from A to B, and the bad interfaz mechanics when you need to equip gear, change items from character to character, sell something or look at the items you got, or pick them. This is not a noob-friendly game; aside from the little dungeon tutorial at the start, you will find little or no help at all and you will find lost yourself if you are not used to RPGs games. However, asking in the forums will help you; there will be trolls, true, but overall the community will end up answering your questions and solving some of your starting problems, I'm pretty sure.\n\nBut if I take all these things together and put them all in a balance, I have to recommend this game to every player in the world. If you are an oldschool gamer you just can't pass on this. And if you are a new player and you didn't play or didn't even know any of the games other guys are mention, you have to give this one a chance and compare it yourself with the new RPGs. I promise you won't be disappointed.\n\n\nPLUS you have also the Enhanced now, which add more quests, balanced skills, graphics, controller support, camera movement, subtitles in some languages, full voice actor and help with some of the issues the game got before. And even more difficult settings, with a new one with permadeath and only one savegame for massoquist tastes.","October 27, 2015","true","8.3"," 167 of 196 people (85%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","85","167","196","8","13"

The game just threw you into this world and left you all alone.\nLuckily for me and everybody else Larian continued working on their game released the enhanced edition. I decided to give it one more try and totally fell in love with this beautiful game.\nFirst an foremost, there is now more guidance at the beginning of the game. You're still pretty much free to do whatever you want, but the game mostly points you in the right direction.  At the beginning it's still a little tough to get into (since you will be doing a lot of running around, talking to people when you would like to test the awesome combat system). But follow through and you get rewarded with one of the most intricately, beautifully crafted RPGs since the Baldur's Gate series.\nEvery handcrafted corner of the world is dripping with the developer's love for details.

There is no RPG like it.\n\nFire + Poison = Explosions.\n100% fire resistance + immunity to burning = walking on lava.\n105% fire resistance = healed by fire.\nYou can talk to the animals!\n\nAt the beginning of the game my mage was using Air magic in combat and shocking themselves into missing a few turns in combat. Lol - I am so lame. Don't stand in a puddle of water ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nI used a rain spell to douse a burning ship and got involved in a love human/ orc thing going on.\n\nI investigated a murder that took me to the end of time and came across and elderly deranged elf looking for justice for his murdered family. (Very creepy voice - lovely acting).\n\nIt's all not fun and games. There is a dark side too where you come across great evil and undead. Of blood and sacrifice and the end of the world.\n\nCombat is turn based and quite a joy. The combination of elements and battlefield layout allow almost infinite possibilities in battle.\n\nUse telekinesis to bash enemies on the head with water barrels. Use your bow or sword. Conjure zombies and fire elementals. Throw grenades. Quaff a healing potion. The world is quite open and you will often come across battles you can't win. Either innovate or come back later.\n\nDo it your way and have bags of fun. Recruit some companions or play through with your original two. Play through a rock, paper, scissors mini game to convince NPCs to accept your views. "These are not the droids you are looking for."\n\nInventory and Crafting. Literally millions of things to pick up which can be crafted into millions of combinations. You uncover recipes as you read books but you can experiment too. Slipping on ice too often? Bang some nine inch nails to the bottom of your boots.\n\nThe developers have also brought a Legend of Grimrock 2 type puzzle element to the game. It's strange. Requires brain function. What? In this game. Really? I can separate my party? In fact one puzzle requires you to kill a party member and teleport to their dead body 'on the other side'. Scary. Amazing.\n\nI really struggled to get into the final location in the game until I retrained my brain and used these teleport pyramids given to you early on. When I solved the puzzles it was like I passed my school exams again. I did me proud.\n\nNegatives needed right?\n\nCrafting - overwhelming at first. Confidence gained in second play through.\n\nMission items - they are not tagged. You can't sell them. You can't find them in your inventory. Where is that stupid, STUPID reveal scroll? Have I broke the game?\n\nMissions - you really can go round and round and round trying to progress. There is only a little hand holding.\n\nSummary\n\nI really, REALLY love this game. It's beautiful. Innovative. It looks like Disney but inside there is iron and steel. It will chew you up and spit you out. It will test your RPG credentials unlike Wasteland 2 or Pillars of the Eternity did.\n\nIf you are looking for a proper RPG, with C&C and complexity - take it on.","April 28","true","101.1"," 51 of 55 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","51","55","5","3"

And it offer many ways to enjoy it cooperatively. This is THE game to play in coop if you have the time.\nThe gameplay is really great as it gives LOT of flexibility and freedom on the build we can make, the items to use and the way to fight during the battle.\n\nHowever the original game suffered for "too much freedom" and lack of informations for the first few hours, that would confused many players. It was hard to know what to do and the story is really slow to start. It also suffered for not having voice acting for 95% of the conversation, so the story was a bit hard to get into sometimes, and many characters were dull and hard to remember.\n\n\nLuckly, this problem is solved! Larian Studios (the developper) offered an amazing new enhanced version (for free for old user) that added voice acting for the whole game, new quests and lot of other things. I will not detailled the additions as you can see them on the store page, but to put it simply it fixes most old problems and improved the whole experience to make a fantastic new game.\n\nThis is the reason why I wanted to make this reccomendation asap even if it's not very well written, because the developper did an amazing job without being greedy, and this is something rare nowadays. And the result is this amazing game.","October 28, 2015","true","22.0"," 46 of 52 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","46","52","0","5"

Game starts out really slow where you just blindly rob everyone in the first town and never leave until you reach a certain level. Well you can leave but if you do so too early then you'll have a hard time outside. If you go out and stray from the main questline you're going to get destroyed cause mobs don't scale with your level so you'll have to do things a certain way. There's a few areas where the sound just dies. This happens in areas where there's a lot of windy and gust noises. Seems to be a bug that hasn't been fixed yet. The turned based combat in this game is really fun as well as you can combo elements. For example you can throw an ice shard, freeze the ground, then cast rain to melt the ice, and use lightning to create a static water field to stun enemies grouped up. I'm nearing 70 hours and I just entered the last major map of the game so there is also a lot of content here with very little loading screens.

Just a few moments I loved:\n\n1. The first time the buddy I am playing with interrupted my conversation and challenged the answer I gave the NPC, resulting in a rock/paper/scissors match. Very cool, and how these answers influence your tendencies, kudos!\n\n2. The first battle I really experience environmental effects. Got frozen, then slipped on the ice, followed by 2 enemies falling beside me...\n\n3. Learning how the crafting system actually works and then being floored by just how detailed it is. Holy crap, what a wonderful addition. Did my buddy really just break a bottle with a hammer and then put the shards of glass in an empty grenade to make an armor-piercing grenade. Cool!\n\n4. When the enhanced edition came out and I got it for free. Thank you Larian Studios, love to see a studio that cares about the customer. Take note State of Decay. Additionally, what an improvement the enhanced edition actually is! Tactician mode is awesome.\n\nI could go on, but I hope you get the point. If you enjoy computer RPGs, play this game.

The combat is difficult because your party is out numbered and out levelled in most situations.  There are only a finite numbers of enemies on the map so you cannot “grind” to level your party up or get better loot.  The game is laid out in a linear way which forces your party to outsmart your enemies by using the proper spells and environment surroundings.\n\nI can appreciate the work done by this indie game developer, but I find this game is little too hardcore for my taste.\n\nDue to the rating system, I can’t give this game a mixed review.\n\nIf you like challenge and exploration based RPGs, you might want to try out Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition.\n\nIf you are a beginner to RPGs, I suggest skipping this game.\n\nAt the end of the day, I have to ask myself "Did I have fun with this game?"

It's not even close. Do NOT waste time reading the things I am about to say about this game. There's no need for that. It's a must buy.\n\nPositives:\n\n- Split screen on PC! (player 2 can join and leave seamlessly while player 1 is playing, just pick up the controller man!).\n- Supports controllers. Because that's how they roll.\n- Both online and offline multiplayer.\n- Over 100 hours worth of content with multiple difficulty levels. And no, the difficulty levels aren't just jacking up the health points and damage. Enemies gain new skills, strategies. Oh, and there's more of them. There's also permadeath mode for you nutjobs. Thought Diablo 3 was hard on hardcore? Think again.\n- Great art style and visuals.\n- So. Many. Damn. Spells. So many.\n- Characters are highly customizable.\n- Awesome loot is highly rewarding. Trust me, good gear in this game makes a huge difference. But not quite as much as a good strategy and smart...\n- Manipulation of elements! You can create water puddles which you then can electrify. Or freeze to create an icy platform to trip your foes.. Or allies. Yes, there is friendly fire and yes it is absolutely glorious.\n- Very difficult fights. There's also puzzles.. Don't worry.. There are guides in YouTube for you slackers too..\n- Dialogue between your characters (or your and your friend's characters!). And yes, you have a choice in, well.. Making choices. And yes, you can disagree.\n- Easy to understand crafting system that was improved in this version. It's very straight forward.\n- You can murder everything in your sight. Even your quest givers. Say goodbye to your possible rewards though.. Or just kill them after the quest.. Not like I have any experience doing that of course.. Also, you can steal (I HIGHLY recommend doing that. God the amount of gold......)\n\nNegatives:\n- Nothing really worth mentioning. I guess if you dislike turn based combat that requires lots of thinking could be considered one if you are more into your average hack 'n slash "rpg's".

It gives you a plethora of weapons, and an okay amount of spells to experience; however the armor and gear in the game has almost no real customization and there is not much effort put into letting you have any type of unique appearance.\n\nThe game has quite a few bugs and oversights unfortunately, from incorrect textures, to health bars in multiplayer not synching up properly (I healed myself too many times when I was already full health because of that problem).\nRain doesn't put out fires, but if you cast rain it does, initial character creation in multiplayer a bit tricky, due to how the multiplayer system works, and misclicking will happen a LOT especially with the auto pathing issues.\nAnother small issue is that all females have high heels as a mandatory thing, regardless of if traveling frozen tundra or volcanic ruins, their class or anything else...\n\nThere is nothing too game breaking however, and most of it is fairly easily dismissed or dealt with.\n\nAll in all it's a great game, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the older slower paced tactical RPGs from when they were younger.","November 29, 2015","true","44.9"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","24","25","3","0"

Divinity is already a game that speaks for itself in most aspects. The graphics, the combat, the story, and customization and options were all top notch and exceeded most peoples expectations. Truly it's a Kickstarter story success. Bringing all the elements of CRPG titles that you know and love, and giving each feature an awesome modern twist. From Co-op/Multiplayer to amazing quests. The Enhanced edition brings more in the form of sharpened graphics, voice acting, controller support, and making the game much more friendly to new players. At the same time they have added new challenges to keep fans of the original title salivating and challenging their tactics and parties to the limit. Being a new player to Divinity, I instantly fell in love with this title and I don't want to look back. This game brings everything I loved about D&D, Ultima, and does things in its own unique style. Giving you the freedom to choose your own party, your own adventure, and have an amazing time while exploring the vast world and lore of Divinity. If you are a fan of CRPG's, there is no reason you shouldn't own this title. Which brings me again back to how amazing it is that they made a great game an even better game.

Does not go easy on the player and the mechanics need to be discovered, but once they are you get a valid sense of achievement when you complete puzzles and defeat challenging bosses.  Inventory is bit of a pain as nearly everything is craftable into something else, so you don't want to get rid of much and the interface doesn't give you a search option (just sort by, which can be helpful).

I mean FULL, so in this game rats can talk and even bull can be fortune-teller!\nBut it's still not the end, I haven't mentioned two biggest features.\nFirst is that in this game you control two main heroes, instead of one as usual. They may have totally different opinions and argue with each other during making decisions. How it affects on the game? Character you don't agree with, may win an argument and make decision you didn't want to make! Almost like in real tabletop RPG games with real players. Brilliant!\nSecond thing is fight. You may interact with environment and use the elements in many combinations, so you can bring the rain, freeze it to slipped enemies, turn the ice back to water and then into steam which may be electrified by lightning and shock lying enemies.

I was catious getting into it as I didnt get into Pillars of Eterinity, its market competition, but my fears were unfounded. The world is rich and well crafted, with memorable characters and long hours of gameplay. As of writing the review with 66 hours in I'm only about 70% done in the main quest. Totally worth it!\n\nAlso, really recommend taking the Pet Pal with one of your characters to enhance your experience with a bit more quests and interactions. Also Timfred the badass buck. Word!\n\nPros:\nLong rich questline and side quests.\nBig zones to explore.\nGood loot system and distribution.\nComplex fights and pretty good AI ability casting (they have a problem with user placed obsticles though).\nGorgeous environments and creature designs.\nAmazing soundtrack, really, it works so well to give atmosphere and enhance fights\nAll narrated charcters, even the mute ones (through a narrator).\nFunny jokes and easter eggs all over, which don't interfere with the overall feel of the game.\n\n\nCons:\nThis game doesnt make it clear where you should go next, even if you want to know. The logs are detailed in case you want to remember details, but I always found myself going into the wrong places and dealing with higher than my level mobs, to later to go to the "correct" place and fight redundant fights for worthless loot. Some places were not in the quest line at all but gave important story info.\nThis game's puzzles are sometimes bad hidden object games, and sometimes "find the combnation" through trial and error. Dont expect to get clues as to what to do on about half of them.\nSteam has a syncing issue with the game where it takes quite some time to sync to the servers after you quit.

I always preferred action RPGs and quick paced fights over sluggish moves and waiting on your opponent's turn. However, Original sin has a great way of combining a HUGE amount of cross-class combos with tons of environment effects like explosions, poisons, ice you can slip on, mud that slows you down, oil you can set fire to… which actually makes no fight like the previous, and your options endless.\n\nPair that with an amazing story, very funny – yet witty dialogues, insanely huge locations to explore, and you have yourself one of the best RPGs ever made - if not the best RPG to date.\n\nThe graphics are gorgeous, bursting with details on par with the golden days of 2D RPGs, and yet again, as in the original Divinity – you can pick up and move pretty much anything in the game which can result in very useful player-made covers during combat, or just plain silly outfits like using a water bucket for your helmet (because - why not?)!\n\nI really won't go into any detail here because no quick Steam review can do this game any justice. The game runs perfectly smooth, no hiccups, no bugs (although you might get into a situation where your other hero doesn't agree with you and overrides some of your decisions which might lead to a specific quest not being able to finish – but that's the only isolated issue I've found in 60+h of gameplay).\n\nTL;DR - It's not a game, it's not a RPG – it's a piece of art.\n\n10/10 – Would pet Arhu again.","May 22","true","68.9"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","12","12","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberghost/recommended/373420/","cyberghost","Cyberghost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberghost/","1190 products in account","My trouble with Divinity: Original Sin began at the character creation screen.\n\nYou have to pick two characters with no explanation as to why. I set about designing a fearsome, burnished bronze-skinned, flame-haired vixen, and I named her Mavis, because old names are brilliant and if I ever get a dog I’ll probably call it Wilf. Mavis looked like she could turn her steely gaze on a field of enemy orcs and they’d burn through fear alone. The other character had hair like Marouane Fellaini, and I called him Barry. This was a mistake.\n\nAfter the brief introduction from a pirate with a voice like John Lennon about some sauce someone had spilt in Rivellon (I wasn’t sure about that bit if I’m honest), you’re thrown pretty much into the deep end. There’s no type of tutorial beyond a training dungeon of sorts, but the UI is quite straightforward and there’s nothing to frighten anyone who managed to get their head around the countless RPGs of old this game resembles, Point-and-click to move, “I” for inventory, you know the drill.\n\nImmediately the game screams I AM RPG at you, with scrolls and mysterious tales and a corpse on the beach. Your two characters interact with everything in sight, from crates that are invariably empty to NPCs who have a series of odd tales to tell; as you reach land you find the journal of a man joyful at how he can fly who then climbs a nearby cliff and discovers that he really can’t, like those pillocks who hurl themselves off Worthing Pier with experimental wings on their back every year.\n\nYou can talk to just about every character in the game, though non-named NPCs have little to say and often ramble over the top of each other like teenagers at a weed-free party. Your adventuring pair even talk to each other in a manner affected by how you’ve chosen their “AI Personality” at the start. I knew no better and chose “random” for both, which turned out to mean “schizophrenic”, as one minute Mavis was complimenting Barry’s grave-robbing skills and the next she was calling him a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for breaking their only lockpick.\n\nIn opening zone Cyseal you’ll eventually unearth two additional characters you can co-opt to form a merry band of travellers. And travel they will around this massive world, which seems to stretch out endlessly in every direction with additional zones to teleport to when you’ve accidentally worked out how. Fans of exploration will certainly have a wondrous time in this game.\n\nUnfortunately, it was a desire to see the world that first led to the realisation that Barry was a useless fool, much like the real Marouane Fellaini. Of course I was happy to blame myself for Barry’s first electrocution, wandering as he was through a puddle at least six inches deep. Dangerous business, puddles. There must have been a warning I missed, I think.\n\nBut absolutely everywhere poor Barry went, trouble found him. Hordes of zombies would home in on him as the weakest link and he would invariably die after a single round of turn-based combat. His mighty weaponry could only have been rendered even more deadly by the addition of a feather duster to his non-sword hand.\n\nAt one point the hapless Barry watched as all three of his colleagues fled a hopeless battle in turn only to realise he was too close to the enemy to get away. Over the course of nine combat turns he tried to use his “action points” to run away, and seemed about to make it to safety when he was ended in a horrifying ball of flame that appeared from Christ alone knows where. As usual, Mavis had to find his sticky pile to resurrect him and escort him back to Cyseal, tail between legs.\n\nAt least part of Barry’s problem was that while exploring the world outside the town, you’re given no warning that you’re about to be attacked by a group of six or seven undead or wolves or similar that are of a far higher level than you could hope to cope with. Retreat becomes depressingly useful, though there seems to be little penalty for it (and once you’ve retreated, have fun working out how to re-link your characters so they’re not wandering about alone – it took me about 20 minutes and you’re on your own).\n\nEven Cyseal held terror after terror for our witless hero. The group would find a book with the solid RPG title of Secrets of the Scroll Volume II, and what self-respecting adventurer wouldn’t want a read of that? So Barry picks it up to flick through, but the game mechanics dictate that he’s actually stealing the book and its nearby owner suddenly goes berserk and starts hacking at him with some sort of axe until he is yet again a tragic red mess the book’s owner now has to clean up.\n\nTheft is everywhere, and if you’ve a moral problem with larceny you’ll get nowhere with this game. When no-one’s looking you can trouser whatever’s on offer in someone’s house to sell to any vendor. If the lady of the house pops to the toilet it’s your duty as saviour of the world to have away with that portrait of her husband while her back is turned.\n\nSome aspects of the game are handled a little ham-fistedly, mostly notably the system for convincing NPCs to let you do what you want. I wanted to get through a door; the guard, of a friendly faction I should add, said “No”. I chose the option to try to “reason with him”. This led to an inexplicable game of rock, paper, scissors, which I lost, at which point the guard decided I was a simpleton and started attacking me. “Chip my rock with your scissors will you? Come here!”\n\nThe game is about depth, exploration, a very pleasing crafting system, and not graphics. Visually it’s no more than fine, though the magic effects when you’re hurling combinations of the four elements at doomed enemies are quite enjoyable. That said, strangely often I found myself entering a building with windows that was lit (poorly) by torches despite the bright sunlight outside.\n\nAnother thing the game is not about, though, is hand-holding. If your favourite flavour of RPG involves a linear story, signposted waypoints and a clear route from start to end via an engaging story, Divinity: Original Sin will not make your 2014. Too often you are left wondering which NPC you haven’t spoken to yet to push things on, trying each one in turn until you’re finally given a clue to one of the (well-written) storylines. It can be quite frustrating if you’re not interested in gradually levelling up and heading off out into the wilds, because without levelling up you will soon find out which of your group is Barry.\n\nUltimately the key to this game is its freedom. If you’re happy to explore an open world, crafting, looting and delving into the often-excellent game mechanics, this game will delight you. If you’re looking for a serious, story-driven RPG, the narrative of Divinity: Original Sin is unlikely to hold your attention for long enough to justify the purchase. It almost seems to want to be a solo (and co-op) MMO, with its depth and flexibility but without the never-ending concern of “other people”.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin belongs in that curious time between Baldur’s Gate and World of Warcraft, having vastly improved on the former but been, in some senses, neutered by the latter and the genre it helped popularise. As a single-player game, Divinity: Original Sin is almost certainly better than most WoW-type fantasy games, but without a coherent, easy-to-follow storyline it straddles the divide a little unsuccessfully.\n\nVERDICT: Granted, even among its many improvements, Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition is not a perfect experience, but it sure is unique. It’s a grand adventure that rewards those who are patient enough to wade through some of the less polished aspects with incredibly rich dialogue, a huge world to affect and explore and much more besides.\n\nMy Rating: 8.9/10\n","March 3","true","32.6"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

The dialog and situations are often hilarious, and the turnbased combat -- while challenging -- is ridiculously fun. Your choices matter and the game frequently encourages you to really think about consequences and how to solve problems, whether it be a troublesome NPC that you'd prefer not to murder or a pesky foe that just won't go down.\n\nRegarding the new Enhanced Edition -- I'm still fairly early into it, but it already feels like a major improvement over the original release. Between the extra polishing, performance improvements, and new features, the game feels much more "finished". In particular, I'm seriously loving the new dual-wielding mechanic, and wands are a blast to use. I could be wrong, but I think I've even encountered new quests that I never ran into in the original edition.\n\nA couple of quick notes for new players: Leveling is much rarer than is typical of modern RPGs. You'll want to give careful consideration to how you allocate your skill and talent points, because a few bad choices early on can really screw you over and may even warrant starting over. If you find yourself wanting to improve a skill but the game won't let you, then that means you don't have enough skill points; you'll need to level up once or twice more to increase your pool of points. (Unfortunately, the game doesn't explain this at all.)\n\nAlso, if you're playing with a mouse and the camera controls feel clunky/uncooperative, I recommend enabling edge panning in the Options menu.\n\nOther reviewers have done a better job at detailing the many cool aspects of the game (and I've yet to mess around with co-op mode), but if you're looking for a challenging RPG that's brimming with fun stuff to do and still manages to never get stale, then this is definitely for you.","October 30, 2015","true","26.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

The game's interface has been simplified, the gameplay has subtly been altered and the game input has been optimized for use with a controller. In addition, new game difficulty settings have been added. Those are some key changes to the game. While those may not seem like a big deal, it drastically changes the feeling of the game. Realistically, by playing this version you're getting the console port version of the game but with pc's strong visual options.\n\nWhat is Divinity: Original Sin? Divinity: Original Sin is a beautiful role playing game featuring strategic turned based party combat in an imaginative medieval setting, all while introducing you to a unique dual-dialouge system between 2 heroes you create at the beginning of the game and play through the game with.\n\nWhat is a "Dual-Dialogue" System? Imagine playing the game as 2 characters, you prioritize one character as your main character, so you think for him/her and make decisions for them on their behalf but there is what makes it different from other role playing games - your secondary character has a say in your choices, they can agree with you or disagree with you and if they disagree with you, then that choice can change the out come of the quest or the storyline as a whole. You cannot control them but they may change the mind of an npc for example which may make you angry. So think of it as simulating playing co-op with a real human and being able to communicate with them on making choices throughout the game's timeline. Similar to old school dungeons and dragons pen and paper games in that respect.\n\nI feel that is one of the game's main selling features as it makes the game very unique.\n\nThe graphics of Divinity: Original Sin are beautiful, it's a modern looking rpg with an old soul and it reflects on the art style it possesses. I love Larian for this.\n\nA stealth element. The game features alot of sneaking, lock-picking and diversions. I found it very entertaining to find I could enter a shop with one character, start a conversation with the shop owner and while in mid-conversation, switch to the other character and sneak in to steal weapons and other items because the shop owner was distracted.  Small things like this make me really enjoy this game.\n\nThe combat is difficult but fair. You must think about your moves ahead of time of you want to survive. Know when to preserve energy or run.\n\nThe storyline doesn't take itself to seriously, there are animals to talk to and alot of moments that might make you laugh out loud. There is alot of depth here though.\n\nThis game features crafting. You can craft items such as different kinds of arrows. So if you are a lovecraftian, you will feel at home here. But don't worry you don't HAVE to craft there is tons of items already in the game as well.\n\nTo close this review before I keep talking about how great this game is all morning long, this game has everything you might want from a western rpg, mixing modern gameplay aesthetics wiith old-school traits of the genre as well. It's a great game I think any rpg fan will enjoy!\n\nThis review was based on the current build of Divinity: Original Sin (Enhanced Edition). I got this edition as a free upgrade from my purchase of Divinity: Original Sin (Classic) - before the enhanced edition released. So I have this edition installed on my Alienware Alpha and the Classic version installed on my Primary Desktop PC.","March 6","true","0.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","2"

KABOOM.\n\nThe 'Enhanced Edition' doesn't change much for most of the game, but does spruce up the ending quite a bit. And it's free anyhow, so what are you even complaining about? Unfortunately however, the game's approach to making puzzles is not enhanced. It's still 'go find this stupid switch that we hid between six levers' or whatever. Ugh. No thanks.\n\nIn any case, I'm quite looking forward to the sequel with it's competitive questing business. That will take a bit stronger storytelling than what they've been doing though. The story is already hard to follow with two people plugging along at different rates. I can't imagine how confusing it'd get when everyone's trying to kill each other or what have you.\n\nBut well, that's something for the future.  For now, this is a good game that people should play.","December 22, 2015","true","57.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","10","12","3","0"

The combat system and character progression are very satisfying.\n\nMain downside i experienced is enemy AI (or rather the lack thereof). It makes no sense that an enemy archer would cc 1 of my summons and then attack another summon in the same turn, while a way more dangerous character of mine is standing right next to it. Things like this really reduce difficulty a lot even on tactician and honour mode. Also a lot of non-combat skills are completely pointless, lockpicking or telekenesis for example.\n\nHowever these were but minor grievances in a thoroughly enjoyable experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Flametrooper/recommended/373420/","Flametrooper","Jade.Wu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Flametrooper/","190 products in account","So I just finished playing through Divinty:OS EE, and my final thoughts upon finishing this game are "Thank god it's over". But I can explain how I got to this stage of complete agony when trying to finish the game. Divinity utterly fails at making the UI a pleasant experience at playing the game. Furthermore the game makes astounding choices that make you question if anyone in the development process asked WHY ARE WE DOING THIS.\nSo to start things off I'll say some things that Divinity does that makes zero sense to me.\n\n-There's no quick trading\nIf you have a ton of ingredients or items to trade to your OTHER character you have to move them ONE ITEM AT A TIME.\nThis is completely ridiculous to say the least, BUT the more astounding thing is that the game actually has a system in place to automatically move quest items from one characters inventory to the character that needs it. In other words? There is absolutely NO reason to ever have two seperate inventories like they've done in the game. Inventories should be "magically linked" 24/7 and capacity combined from the characters.\n\n-Healing after combat\nThis is one that I think gets ruined for me after playing The Last Remnant. See the concept is that in TLR you fight every battle like it's your last battle so you are FULL HEALED after every combat. Divinity decided that you should be forced to heal yourself after every fight, which makes sense IF there was a system that worked around this. The problem is kinda covered w/NO MANA so skills can be used freely outside of combat to heal. However this takes hours because of the cooldowns. There's food that can be used as well which has no cooldown and can heal decently. But THE BEST HEALING can be done FOR FREE in a bed next to most Waypoints. So let me just ask if it makes more sense to either\nA) Fully Heal the Party after every Fight\nor\nB) TP to a Waypoint and go lay down in beds to fully heal which takes a grand total of 2 minutes every time\nWhen they both achieve the same objective which is HAVING A HEALED PARTY. Neither of them cost anything except for the second option which is a COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.\nPLEASE DEVS DONT DO THIS AGAIN FOR THE SEQUEL.\nEither make Inns and Spells cost mana (which means healing COSTS something forcing the player into making choices about when to go back) or completely heal the party after combat, there's no inbetween.\n\n-No Mana\nKind of covered previously but skills cost no mana in the game. Everything runs off AP in combat so outside of combat everything can be used freely as long as it's off cooldown. This seems like a good idea, and quite frankly I enjoy the thought of it. But to be quite frank, it made more problems than it fixed. Mage characters in the game easily benefit over this kind of stuff where spells could be used right before the fight breaks out at no negative to the player since nothing was wasted. The spell was cast and the player has no mana or ap loss since it was considered to be cast 'outside of combat'.\nThere is synergy that exists in this game which is beyond cool, but the problem is that the pay off for these synergies is waaaaay too much. These synergies (mostly the poison cloud explosion) do FAR too much damage and can be done even with grenades. I was able to kill most large mobs in a single turn with this combination, and it just felt cheap. Master level mage classes can do large AoE spells like Earthquake, Hailstorm, etc which also do copious amounts of damage. I get that mages would probably be weaker towards the late game but that's why spells should more heavily weigh off of the Int. level of the character.\n\n-Invisibility and How it ruins the Game\nYou can go invisible and steal anything just sitting around without worry. A max leveled pickpocket can go to town with invisibility and bleed everyone dry. I was sitting on 200k gold when I finished my playthrough. There was literally nothing I could have bought to spend this money.\n\n-Leandra\nI don't know if this was the enhanced edition only or what, but the fight begins with Leandra surrounded by 4 Void Knights and Three demons. The fight begins by the three demons casting THREE INVULNERABILITY AURAS one of which goes to Leandra. I immediately off one of the demons and two rounds later (when the invulnerability wears off), the remaining two demons PLACE THE INVULNERABILITY AGAIN. I kill the next demon and yet again the process continues. Finally all of the demons are dead and I can go for the boss! NOPE. Physical Immunity aura and eventually places an elemental immunity aura as well. Now the problem with this fight was that it was entirely wasting your time. For 8 turns you have to sit there with characters being COMPLETELY INVULNERABLE. Now this makes no sense to me because the Void Aura is supposed to be able to get hit through as long as the character has a tenebrium weapon. WHICH DIDNT WORK. I had a weapon that required Tenebrium skill lvl 2 which APPARENTLY doesn't count as Tenebrium. Irremovable invulnerability is never a fun option to a fight. Especially not when this is one of three fights IN A ROW that you have to do at the end of the game.\n\n-Crafting System and Blacksmithing\nThe crafting system at times makes absolutely no sense and Blacksmithing is simply worthless because you'll never make an item that's halfway decent. Seriously go look up the crafting recipes online, google Divinity crafting for a .pdf file that will be the first option. You can make fish pies, apple pies, pizza, and cheese bread from dough but CANNOT make a pumpkin pie. At first I was willing to go along with it until I realized how asinine the recipes were. A jar of mud combined with a fiery heart makes the most OP weapon in the game, a sword of planes. Take THAT blacksmithing.\n\n-Identifying and Repairing\nMerchants/Player don't have a Repair All or Identify All button. I don't know why.\n\n-Perception\nThere is no reason this game should rely so heavily on this. It just feels cheap. If you don't level it you'll get stuck with no answers until you read online that your perception should be 10. You buff it to 10 and proceed on. There's only negatives to keeping this around.\n\n-Puzzles\nThe puzzles were mostly for children which was the the practice of put the cylinder through the cylinder hole concept. When the game didn't rely on this, it instead quickly shifted to tiny buttons that are hard to see or find in large rooms. Tiny buttons are not puzzles.\n\n-Teleport Pyramids\nWhile I thought initially they were a neat idea, I quickly realized that it was a cheap fix or free puzzle item for the devs.  When in doubt get the puzzle to somehow incorporate leaving one character behind and having to use the pyramid to bring them back. Also I thought I would be fancy and leave a pyramid in an area I wanted to quickly return to. But apparently the devs think I'm stupid so the pyramid would get teleported into my inventory if I left it (Waypoint travel). This makes no sense to me BECAUSE as long as you have one of the pyramids it's absolutely impossible to lose the other one. I thought that was the point of the pyramids but I GUESS NOT.\n\n-The First Town\nToo close to the start, players enter and are given too much to do in the town which results in not leaving for a few hours.\n\nBugs\n-Enemies just stare in combat and waste your time (The Fix? Combat skip to YOUR turn.)\n-Icara (An essential NPC) died during one of the final bouts, her dead corpse kept teleporting to me but I had no way to revive her. I easily killed the boss in two rounds without this NPC, but it also affected the Ending where I was unable to ask Zandalor what happened to the Sisters, BECAUSE she was dead and I was never given an option to fix the Soul Forge.\n\nI had more to say but WORD LIMIT\ntl;dr It's okay but not a 9/10 game. Expect a 6/10 at best.\nIn 2-4 hours I was impressed, after 20-30 hours I was annoyed.\nRecent games must be awful for this to be amazing.","January 13","false","65.2"," 84 of 160 people (53%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","53","84","160","10","17"

This was a huge pain the the Original Sin since each character basically had their own gold purse. Furthermore, the interface for crafting has been overhauled as well, leaning more on drag 'n drop for convenience.\n\nNew is also game modes, which replaces the regular mode in Original Sin with something they call  Classic Mode. If you want harder difficulties, Honour mode is what you're after. There's also tactician mode and some others. There are more quests to dive into as well, along with some new abilities and the like.\n\nEnhanced edition also bring full voice acting to the table, which is for the most part great. However, my only gripe with this game is that the enhanced edition has replaced some of the iconic voices of the first Original Sin with new voice actors that don't suit the tone of the game too well. The cheese vendor for instance, one of the NPC dudes you'll hear the most, has been switched out from the Original Sin. The excuses for switching him out, has more holes in it than a slice of a fine gorgombert.\n\n"Don't like cheese?

All of that is now still there and it's certainly nice even interacting with a fish vendor or other minor entity that it has it's own voice.  Fantastic!  That alone would be worth buying the enhanced addition.\n\nQuests have been reworked so they are more streamlined and additional quests have been added.  I was playing along the first major quest noticing a quest item had been moved here or there but it was essentially the same storyline.  Happy to report that keyboard and mouse working just fine - and PC demands were performing better with no visual hitching or bugs that I noticed.  I am not running the game on a 'state of the art machine' 12GB of DDR3 Ram, Quad Core Processor and only 1 GTX 680 (the other one died haven't bothered to replace it); so overall performance is optimized pretty damn well.\n\nNext, after 2/3 of the way through the main first storyline (Mysterious Murdur) I plugged my controller in - a 360 controller and was immediately detected with a tutorial starting up as things came up to show how to interact with the world using it.  I found the transition seemless.  The radial menus are easy to navigate, and became intuitive after an hour or so.  Navigating inventory, a somewhat annoying task with mouse/keyboard I found to be a bit easier though you can certainly flip from mouse/keyboard and back to controller easily enough (ingame keybind) so choose which way you want to play.  Personally I found that sitting back and moving my team around using a controller much easier as I've often lately grown tired of clicking around etc so its nice to sit back on my couch thus using my 360 Controller.\n\nIs this game worth a buy then?  It was with the unenhanced version and well, it certainly is now.  So what are you wating for?  I would buy this if you like RPGs, its a fantastic game with hours and hours of gameplay.  The added voice content and controller support offering more ways to play a great game.","February 8","true","25.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I played Divinity II a few years ago, which was a small budget but fairly decent title also from Larian, so it really is no surprise that they managed something quite remarkable with a stronger, crowd-funded budget. I hope they keep this level for the next release as well!\n\nThe game revolves around dual protagonists with one optional companion each, so a group of 2 - 4. The RPG system is kinda new but easily recognizable by seasoned veterans of the genre. There's a lot of fun to be had with the way elements interact and a lot of interesting choices to be made in the levelling system. Mastering the game takes thought and experience but playing the game is easy and intuitive in itself.\n\nThe story is fun, nothing THAT special narratively, but the true quality is in the telling. Humorous, colourful, varied and sometimes outright dark, it comes together nicely in the end. Lots of little details to explore and combat is very rarely repetitive. It revolves a lot around the four elements and how they interact mixed with some crowd-controlling abilities, buffs and debuffs from other lines (do NOT ignore these if you play on a difficult setting!). The only problem I encountered was that I often mess around with different classes and ideas on a difficult setting while I learn the game mechanics well enough to create my exact party concept. In this game, there is a bit of a lull early on in the game with a lot of story-driven gameplay which can be a bit tedious to replay seven times before you get the party balance right. Apart from that, this game is just quite simply excellent. If you're into RPG games at all, you should definitely check out this title.","January 30","true","0.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's got some of my favourite aspects of an RPG:\n\n- Total customisation: custom classes, freedom to use any skill, build any build, can equip anything you want as long as you have the stats. Completely original.\n- Strategic turn-based battle: it almost plays like D&D -- you plan out what you want to do, you communicate with your co-op partner, plus a bit of randomness like a die roll as you confirm and see what happens. Sometimes hilarious.\n- Quest decisions: multiple ways to finish quests, your characters gain traits and bonuses depending on your roleplaying actions throughout the game.\n- Fun stealth aspect. Not essential but it was fun sneaking around, pickpocketing, lockpicking.\n- Great writing, voice acting and art. It's got a sense of humour and quirky writing. The in-game graphics IMO much better than that ugly anime-ish cover/splash page. Literally every NPC line is voice-acted, and done well. The amount of voice acting is on the level of Oblivion or Skyrim.\n\nThe main storyline is a very slow burn. Even at about 20 hours in, you're still kind of not sure what's going on, but it's simply so fun exploring, collecting loot, selling loot, levelling, that you don't even care.\n\nThis game really surprised me by how fun it was and how much depth there is.

It mixes an old familiar feel from early RPGs like Fall Out and Arcanum (using turn points) with an original take on using attributes to effect your turn points. Of course the usual things like constitution still gives hit points and things like that, but I feel the entire stat system as it pertains to combat is perfectly balanced.\n\n--Story 6/10: Ok so the story isn't the best, but it isn't bad either. It certainly keeps you involved. It has two draw backs - its slow to start, and the other I won't say for minor spoiler sake.\n\n--Graphics 8/10: I mean, its a turn based rpg.... so don't expect anything like skyrim. But compared to everything else in its game-group, its at least as good.\n\nOverall, its well polished and worth playing. Would teleport a rabit into a lava pit again.","April 9","true","138.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This is a perfect analogy for divine divinity original sin. At base, its a really strong RPG with great combat mechanics and multi-layered story line involving the very destruction of time and space.\n\nDespite this, the game manages a blanket of humour that's just enough to stop the game taking itself too seriously and subtle enough not to undermine the core game. Visuals, voice acting and game stability are all first rate and the developers continue to give up dates well after the games initial release date. Original sin is a obvious labour of love and all that time and attention shows. My personal complaints about the game are small and could even be seen as nitpicking but i wanted to share all my thoughts. Crafting feels unsatisfying and unnecessary, i wanted to explore this aspect of the game but was continually turned off after a minute or so of trying to involved. Loot, there is way too much loot. After every fight and even chest discovery i found myself constantly comparing my new find to the gear i have on. It seems every 5 mins of gameplay brings the potential of an upgrade. I didn't like this for two reasons, it breaks the immersion of the world and compelling story line i am engaged in and two, legendary items don't feel legendary, the feel common place. Lore master is also a little immersion breaking. Everything you get an item you need to find it in your backpack, right click to identify item then begin the comparison to your current gear i previously mentioned, it would be much more efficient if it just proc'ed naturally.\n\nDespite these minor flaws  divinity is one of the greatest story driven RPG's of all time. Even the companions have compelling stories that reveal themselves over time and time in well with the main plot. The isometric RPG could be seen as played out but Larian have breathed enough fresh ideas into it that it feels like an advanced step in the games style rather than a mere throwback. The duel main character aspect was particularly refreshing. If you are sitting on the fence then i urge you to give this game a try. There is plenty bang for your buck and virtually none of it feels like filler. 9/10","March 31","true","106.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Let's go over pro's and cons\n\n1. Co-op. As a man that searches for games to play with his wife I love this idea. Couch co-op or online. It's seemless at sharing the same screen as well for great splitscreen gameplay. It also makes it easy to share dialogue options with two players and to quest together. We had so much fun together.\n2. Visually beautiful. This game has a wonderfully colorful pallette.\n3. Amount of gameplay time. The amount of content makes this game easily worth $100 and yet it goes for something like $40. A great value.\n4. Storyline- Wow. Just wow. A multiply layered story with many stories interweaving in one another. Fantastic.\n5. Voice Acting and Music- Beautiful music and great voice overs.\n6. Combat- fun turn based combat that uses the elements well.\n7. Beautiful and varied enviroments.\n8. Great controller support\n\nCons\n1. The monster designs wtih a few exceptions (Bracchus Rex, Trife, the undeead mini bosses), were uninspired trope fantasy stock.\n2. Puzzles- Some of them I just hated. I had to actually find a stupid switch I missed.\n3. Broken quest system- It's easy to miss a switch, accidently drop or lose an item, etc. Be careful not to sell or drop an item, key, or book unless you know for sure you don't need it.\n4. The Mapping system makes orienting and finding your position difficult for the direction challenged such as myself.  There is no waypoint systems and the way the map movies makes finding east, west, north, south tricky. It could have been done better.\n\nAll that said. This game is so much fun, and playing hours upon hours with my wife was a great experience we both loved. I waited for the steam sale, but when they release a sequel we don't plan on waiting this time!\n\n\n","May 9","true","104.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EvilLost/recommended/373420/","EvilLost","EvilLost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EvilLost/","626 products in account","This was a kickstarter project!? It is no surprise that the Kickstarter for Original Sin 2 met its goals five times over within 12 hours.\n\nAAA+++ production, major updates to the game on re-release and provided FREE to original owners (other developers take notes!!!)\n\nNot only is this one of the best RPGs I have ever played but I fully support Larian Studios in their future endevaors. They listen to their community, they provide updates to year old games without trying to bilk their customers for more money, and they have made one heck of an amazing game!\n\nPROS:\n-Incredible game engine\n-Excellent combat mechanics\n-NON LINEAR questlines. You can complete most quests via several different methods.\n-Almost ALL characters can be attacked/stolen from/killed. This can lead to a variety of methods for completing quests (although on rare occasion you might render a side quest incompletable if you kill everyone involved but this will not hinder your progress in the main story).\n-LOTS of content! (My one playthrough, skipping all dialogues, was just over 80 hours).\n-Solid graphics\n-Solid voice acting\n\nNEUTRALS:\n-There seems to be a rich backstory, but I play mainly for the mechanics and not for the plot so I skipped all the dialogue/etc (and still spent around 80 hours for a single playthrough).\n\n-Skill/stat distribution is in need of a complete overhaul (the EE changes did not help much):\n--Primary stats are virtually useless (esp past 10 points at which point you can use all related gear).  The only worthwhile stat otherwise is Constitution for HP (or Perception for archers). Mages don't need perception since wands always have 100% hit chance.\n--Skills are oddly distributed and severely lacking. Most builds will require 2 or maybe 3 skills total; you will have far more than enough skill points for this leaving a lot of leftover points with no real skills to take. FOR EXAMPLE: An archer build needs 5 bow (or xbow) and 5 marksman.....thats it. No other skill will improve the archers dps, and if you choose to take a school of magic then you are no longer shooting your bow... the only other thing is to take Lucky Charm, but even then it just gives you offense rating which only equates to CHANCE to hit (not a dps buff).\n--The stat/skill/talent system is inherently fine; the problem is with the current layout of abilities and stats. The talents also need a serious overhaul, with particular focus on talents gained at skill levels 3 and 5 to promote more build variety.\n\n***These are issues that would be a major deal in competitive multiplayer, but since D:OS 1 is a single player/coop game these issues are VERY MINOR and will hopefully be fixed for D:OS 2's competitive multiplayer component.\n\n\nCONS:\n-A variety of skills are far too similar, with certain classes simply being better. FOR EXAMPLE: Freezing Touch and Petrifying touch are identical skills, except "Frozen" provides an addition +10 armor to the target which Petrify does not. This means petrify is better in almost all instances over frozen as a status modifier.\n\nInstead, the different schools should be functionally opposites. This is well executed with Cold and Fire magic:  Frozen (unable to act, -10% cold resist, +10% fire resist) -> Chilled (same buffs as frozen) -> normal (no buffs) -> Warmed (-10% fire resist, +10 cold resist) -> Burning (DoT, -10% fire resist, +10% cold resist).  The function of fire magic and cold magic is distinctly different, and one can negate frozen by intentionally firing/heating up the target and vice versa.\n\nUnfortunately, not all schools of magic operate on this principle and consistency would go a long way (especially for competitive mp coming in the sequel).\n\n-Blacksmithing is almost worthless.\n-Crafting is boring although it does provide minor stat buffs.","March 15","true","81.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Save often peoples...) The game introduces a very fun and unique conversation system, that especially shines when your playing with a friend or family member, Allowing you and your Co-op partner to make decisions on how you feel and want to do in the game world. (Even if your Co-Op partner is settled on always trolling and disagreeing with you just to start an arguement)\n\nThe combat is engaging and difficult, But not too much so. Although I will say it does matter what type of party you have set up, For instance, My party I have for my Solo playthrough is 3 different type of melee characters (One who can heal of course.) And a archer... Now, while its still fun, such a team is much harder to playthrough the game with then, I dont know, a team with only one melee character and 2 mages instead. But regardless it doesnt take away from the fun of the game.\n\nNow for a few cons about the game... Personally I feel the game offers little in the way of actual character appearance options. You make two characters, But without being able to change your characters build what-so-ever if you make two of the same gender characters they tend to look a bit similar. Not to mention there is only 3 voices per gender and about 10 or hair style's and faces. Im not saying this is a big deal by any means, You can still make characters you'll enjoy playing, and I know alot of people would like to argue about how much your characters appearance matters in a game like this, But I honestly think the closer you can get the character to how you imagine your adventuring crew helps with immersion and feeling your characters more. Who knows, I might just be weird or something... Heh.\n\nAs for the other beef I have with this game is *Sigh* it kinda feels like your always pushed to do stuff in a certain order, No matter how much bragging goes on about the tabletop-like freedoms of the game, Simply put you will have to explore the world in "somewhat" a set order. The main reason for this is because levels on this game are a big deal at times. So say you set off for a quest that seems interesting at the time to find out that the enemys are 2 or 3 levels higher, Well your better off just walking away and doing a different quest or finding a way to earn some experience points before going back. And honestly, even when you do complete stuff 1 or 2 higher levels than you (Which isnt easy at all) That means you 'prolly just overleveled yourself for a different quest, Taking away from the difficulty of that quest. It isnt a huge problem honestly, because you still have some choices on what to do and when, but it feels bad when alot of things around you are too high of a level and you know theres only two or three quests you can do.\n\nOverall I find the game EXTREMELY SATISFYING! No matter how much I said about the cons the game is still overwhelmingly good. The endless ways to build your team is wonderful, Tank healers, Two-handed sword mages, fire magic archers or even traditional type builds like pure mages or sword and shield... Basically anything you can think of! (Just make sure you spend your attribute and skill points wisely!) The endless ways of building your team helps keep the game fresh through multiple replays, Despite if you kinda go through the quest in a somewhat similar order. Also theres more than one way to do some quests, so that helps too. Bottom line, If you, and perhaps a friend, want a good turn-based rpg world to explore then look no further! Buy this game!","January 23","true","117.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For a season RPG player, the game is fairly straight forward, but what truly shines is the actual decision making and morality of the dialouge. Rather than leaving things open-ended, companions will disagree with you, frown upon you, and even "rock, paper, scissor" you to determine the outcome of your decision. This is actually my favorite feature in the entire game thus far, and is reminiscent of older titles like Baldur's Gate, but taken to new heights with a more fluid AI, and a less cumbersome alignment system.\n\n\n\n...

The enhanced edition only adds that much more polish to an already awesome game. In my view the best thing about this game is the combat, If your looking for RPG combat with a tactical but still modern feel look no further.\n\nWhen I originally bought Divinity OS I  had been looking for a game with turn based combat that wasen't just the same old side-view battle screen thing since I have never found that very appealing. Divinity OS provided turn-based tactical combat in a 3d world where the elements interact dynamically with each other. Want to get rid of a poison cloud? hit it with a fireball and make it explode. Enemy not flammable enough for you? douse him in a puddle of oil and light it on fire. And heaven forbid you accidentally light yourself on fire, you can have someone cast a rain spell to put you ( and everything else in a large radius) out. Simply put, It's just a tremendous amount of fun. For me it was the first RPG in decades that actually recaptured that stay-up-all-night gaming thrill I found when I was a kid, and for that I can't thank larian enough. The terrific co-op just adds that much more value to an already exceptional game. The story is interesting, even if parts of it are a little cliche, the characters are memorable, the soundtrack is, well let's say "divine", the graphics are good, and its all pulled together by the best turn based combat experience I have ever had. Possibly the only area of the game that could have used more work is the somewhat clunky crafting system, but even that is workable.\n\nNow as far as what the Enhanced Edition brings to the table, it's quite a bit actually. It adds full voice-acting along with controller support, which was needed because of the addition of local co-op and the port to various consoles ( I still prefer the mouse and keyboard, but the controller setup is pretty well thought out). Skills have been changed, added and generally polished. Two new weapon types, grenades and wands, are now available ( both are quite a bit of fun)...I'm sure there are plenty of other improvements that I just can't think of at the moment, but suffice to say it's well worth buying.\n\nOn a side note, kudos to Larian for giving those of us who owned the original version when the enhanced edition came out a free copy of it. They really didn't have to do that, and I think that is evidence they are a company worth supporting, which among other reasons is why I backed the kickstarter for DOS 2.\n\nIn summary, the things I liked and didn't-\n\nDivinity Original Sin EE:\n\n+Good Graphics\n+Great Soundtrack\n+Interesting Story\n+Awesome Turn Based Combat\n+Great Co-Op ( now also with local co-op)\n+Full Voice Acting\n+Good Character Development\n\n- somewhat cumbersome crafting system ( tweaked in EE, a little better)","February 14","true","112.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Overall a very great and unique RPG game, and I don't know why I didn't give a thought earlier on.\n\nWARNING! Contains some spoilers:\nWithin the first one or two hours of gameplay, I managed to complete the tutorial dungeon and the surrounding area. Had a mini boss-fight within the dungeon. Gangbanged a soldier behind one of my characters, and then froze and teleported the mini-boss skyhigh and back onto the ground 15m away from the origin. Received an arrow shot from another soldier in the next turn but he got frozen quickly afterwards and then shattered by a knight ram-kill. Only the boss left and he had decided to stand up and come for us. Within close range (when it's my turn), he was frozen and gangbanged. And he turned into ghost form. I just simply ignored the spells and skill sets and just finished him off as usual. RIP...\n\nCame out from the dungeon and had a chat with two human (Roman) soldiers. They were drunk and annoying, so I decided to shut them up (there was another option to just let them be). They laid dead within turns.\n\n10/10 will teleport, freeze and shatter people again; and shut them up if they're drunk.","February 13","true","40.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not a massive turn-based RPG fan but this game really did deliver in every way.\n\nIt is difficult at the start (for a short while) if you are a bit of a noob like me but only because I didn't realise quite how tactical you need to be! Once you discover that you'll need to think about using the environment, sight lines and structures to aid you against difficult enemies, it suddenly clicks! The game is very well balanced (in normal mode - which is all I've played), and each fight could go either way if you recklessly run into a situation. It is very enjoyable and the world, characters and quests are all expertly constructed.\n\nWhat I very much appreciate also is that it isn't pandering to the direction of most mainstream titles by making the combat etc a bit of a chore, rather than a challenge (e.g. Diablo 3, which did not do Diablo 2 justice in my opinion). It also actually requires you to think a bit in the puzzles and quests and gives you mutltiple options.\n\nDivinity - Awesome game!","January 5","true","46.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is reminiscent of Dark Alliance, Baulders Gate, it handles smoothly, and really brings alot of options to the table.  To tie it all together, the game has a nice atmosphere, good soundtrack, and campy humor, which really brings out the best in the gaming experience.\n\nPros: smooth gameplay, entertaining and challenging quests, good story, enjoyable dialogue, and visualy appealing.\n\nCons: Lack of inital character customization.

It is consuming my every waking thought.  Usually in these types of games I don't care what every NPC has to say, but in Divinity, I'm curious as to what is going to happen next.  The environment is beautiful, the story is witty and fun.  The combat is entertaining.\n\nI wouldn't consider myself a hardcore gamer and I have racked up over 50 hours in this game in just over a week.  That's insane. The only issues I have are minor, like quest direction can be somewhat vague at times and targeting in combat can sometimes change when the target moves right when you click making you move to the target instead of attacking, thereby losing your AP.  Inventory management could be a little bit better laid out, but these are all minor and don't take away from the overall experience.

Clocking in at ~60 hours for that run, I have to say that, barring some poor design choices, this is an RPG of a quality I don't see often, high as it is.\nWhere it counts: in making decisions that define your character(s), in the engrossing combat mechanics and the outstanding world design, Divinity: Original Sin shines as a unique example of an RPG done right.\nThat said, the Diablo leanings the game has, in the inventory system most particularly, detract from what could've been an even more interesting experience. Fiddling with a massive inventory that keeps overflowing with prefixed and suffixed items, many of which aren't that good, was tedious.\nAnother minor bad point is the practical punishment for preparing for tough battles. The system doesn't let you down potions in advance, nor apply buffs. They don't last long enough if you initiate combat willingly. Food, it appears, under this, is useless.\nBut with all that said, I still enjoyed the game a whole bunch and can recommend it greatly.","January 6","true","75.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Mages don't need perception since wands always have 100% hit chance.\n--Skills are oddly distributed and severely lacking. Most builds will require 2 or maybe 3 skills total; you will have far more than enough skill points for this leaving a lot of leftover points with no real skills to take. FOR EXAMPLE: An archer build needs 5 bow (or xbow) and 5 marksman.....thats it. No other skill will improve the archers dps, and if you choose to take a school of magic then you are no longer shooting your bow... the only other thing is to take Lucky Charm, but even then it just gives you offense rating which only equates to CHANCE to hit (not a dps buff).\n--The stat/skill/talent system is inherently fine; the problem is with the current layout of abilities and stats. The talents also need a serious overhaul, with particular focus on talents gained at skill levels 3 and 5 to promote more build variety.\n\n***These are issues that would be a major deal in competitive multiplayer, but since D:OS 1 is a single player/coop game these issues are VERY MINOR and will hopefully be fixed for D:OS 2's competitive multiplayer component.\n\n\nCONS:\n-A variety of skills are far too similar, with certain classes simply being better. FOR EXAMPLE: Freezing Touch and Petrifying touch are identical skills, except "Frozen" provides an addition +10 armor to the target which Petrify does not. This means petrify is better in almost all instances over frozen as a status modifier.\n\nInstead, the different schools should be functionally opposites. This is well executed with Cold and Fire magic:  Frozen (unable to act, -10% cold resist, +10% fire resist) -> Chilled (same buffs as frozen) -> normal (no buffs) -> Warmed (-10% fire resist, +10 cold resist) -> Burning (DoT, -10% fire resist, +10% cold resist).  The function of fire magic and cold magic is distinctly different, and one can negate frozen by intentionally firing/heating up the target and vice versa.\n\nUnfortunately, not all schools of magic operate on this principle and consistency would go a long way (especially for competitive mp coming in the sequel).\n\n-Blacksmithing is almost worthless.\n-Crafting is boring although it does provide minor stat buffs.","March 15","true","81.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Reloading my save always fixed it though.\nSometimes the AI wouldn't know what to do in battle and stand there for about 10 seconds before ending their turn.\nSometimes I had some trouble selecting enemies during combat due to their idle animations.\n\nOverall I would give it a solid 9/10 with only some minor annoyances here and there.","March 7","true","113.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Save often peoples...) The game introduces a very fun and unique conversation system, that especially shines when your playing with a friend or family member, Allowing you and your Co-op partner to make decisions on how you feel and want to do in the game world. (Even if your Co-Op partner is settled on always trolling and disagreeing with you just to start an arguement)\n\nThe combat is engaging and difficult, But not too much so. Although I will say it does matter what type of party you have set up, For instance, My party I have for my Solo playthrough is 3 different type of melee characters (One who can heal of course.) And a archer... Now, while its still fun, such a team is much harder to playthrough the game with then, I dont know, a team with only one melee character and 2 mages instead. But regardless it doesnt take away from the fun of the game.\n\nNow for a few cons about the game... Personally I feel the game offers little in the way of actual character appearance options. You make two characters, But without being able to change your characters build what-so-ever if you make two of the same gender characters they tend to look a bit similar. Not to mention there is only 3 voices per gender and about 10 or hair style's and faces. Im not saying this is a big deal by any means, You can still make characters you'll enjoy playing, and I know alot of people would like to argue about how much your characters appearance matters in a game like this, But I honestly think the closer you can get the character to how you imagine your adventuring crew helps with immersion and feeling your characters more. Who knows, I might just be weird or something... Heh.\n\nAs for the other beef I have with this game is *Sigh* it kinda feels like your always pushed to do stuff in a certain order, No matter how much bragging goes on about the tabletop-like freedoms of the game, Simply put you will have to explore the world in "somewhat" a set order. The main reason for this is because levels on this game are a big deal at times. So say you set off for a quest that seems interesting at the time to find out that the enemys are 2 or 3 levels higher, Well your better off just walking away and doing a different quest or finding a way to earn some experience points before going back. And honestly, even when you do complete stuff 1 or 2 higher levels than you (Which isnt easy at all) That means you 'prolly just overleveled yourself for a different quest, Taking away from the difficulty of that quest. It isnt a huge problem honestly, because you still have some choices on what to do and when, but it feels bad when alot of things around you are too high of a level and you know theres only two or three quests you can do.\n\nOverall I find the game EXTREMELY SATISFYING! No matter how much I said about the cons the game is still overwhelmingly good. The endless ways to build your team is wonderful, Tank healers, Two-handed sword mages, fire magic archers or even traditional type builds like pure mages or sword and shield... Basically anything you can think of! (Just make sure you spend your attribute and skill points wisely!) The endless ways of building your team helps keep the game fresh through multiple replays, Despite if you kinda go through the quest in a somewhat similar order. Also theres more than one way to do some quests, so that helps too. Bottom line, If you, and perhaps a friend, want a good turn-based rpg world to explore then look no further! Buy this game!","January 23","true","117.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The enhanced edition only adds that much more polish to an already awesome game. In my view the best thing about this game is the combat, If your looking for RPG combat with a tactical but still modern feel look no further.\n\nWhen I originally bought Divinity OS I  had been looking for a game with turn based combat that wasen't just the same old side-view battle screen thing since I have never found that very appealing. Divinity OS provided turn-based tactical combat in a 3d world where the elements interact dynamically with each other. Want to get rid of a poison cloud? hit it with a fireball and make it explode. Enemy not flammable enough for you? douse him in a puddle of oil and light it on fire. And heaven forbid you accidentally light yourself on fire, you can have someone cast a rain spell to put you ( and everything else in a large radius) out. Simply put, It's just a tremendous amount of fun. For me it was the first RPG in decades that actually recaptured that stay-up-all-night gaming thrill I found when I was a kid, and for that I can't thank larian enough. The terrific co-op just adds that much more value to an already exceptional game. The story is interesting, even if parts of it are a little cliche, the characters are memorable, the soundtrack is, well let's say "divine", the graphics are good, and its all pulled together by the best turn based combat experience I have ever had. Possibly the only area of the game that could have used more work is the somewhat clunky crafting system, but even that is workable.\n\nNow as far as what the Enhanced Edition brings to the table, it's quite a bit actually. It adds full voice-acting along with controller support, which was needed because of the addition of local co-op and the port to various consoles ( I still prefer the mouse and keyboard, but the controller setup is pretty well thought out). Skills have been changed, added and generally polished. Two new weapon types, grenades and wands, are now available ( both are quite a bit of fun)...I'm sure there are plenty of other improvements that I just can't think of at the moment, but suffice to say it's well worth buying.\n\nOn a side note, kudos to Larian for giving those of us who owned the original version when the enhanced edition came out a free copy of it. They really didn't have to do that, and I think that is evidence they are a company worth supporting, which among other reasons is why I backed the kickstarter for DOS 2.\n\nIn summary, the things I liked and didn't-\n\nDivinity Original Sin EE:\n\n+Good Graphics\n+Great Soundtrack\n+Interesting Story\n+Awesome Turn Based Combat\n+Great Co-Op ( now also with local co-op)\n+Full Voice Acting\n+Good Character Development\n\n- somewhat cumbersome crafting system ( tweaked in EE, a little better)","February 14","true","112.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's been on my wishlist since before it's release and I was always hesitant about getting it.  However, after i bought it, I realized what I'd been missing the entire time.  The gameplay is reminiscent of Dark Alliance, Baulders Gate, it handles smoothly, and really brings alot of options to the table.  To tie it all together, the game has a nice atmosphere, good soundtrack, and campy humor, which really brings out the best in the gaming experience.\n\nPros: smooth gameplay, entertaining and challenging quests, good story, enjoyable dialogue, and visualy appealing.\n\nCons: Lack of inital character customization.  Every male is burly and shaped the same, and every woman is thin and attractive.  Its not a huge complaint, but when i make a rouge character i prefer a slim, more elusive frame vs the burly knight type character.","January 6","true","76.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Clocking in at ~60 hours for that run, I have to say that, barring some poor design choices, this is an RPG of a quality I don't see often, high as it is.\nWhere it counts: in making decisions that define your character(s), in the engrossing combat mechanics and the outstanding world design, Divinity: Original Sin shines as a unique example of an RPG done right.\nThat said, the Diablo leanings the game has, in the inventory system most particularly, detract from what could've been an even more interesting experience. Fiddling with a massive inventory that keeps overflowing with prefixed and suffixed items, many of which aren't that good, was tedious.\nAnother minor bad point is the practical punishment for preparing for tough battles. The system doesn't let you down potions in advance, nor apply buffs. They don't last long enough if you initiate combat willingly. Food, it appears, under this, is useless.\nBut with all that said, I still enjoyed the game a whole bunch and can recommend it greatly.","January 6","true","75.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Attention is paid to every detail from the contents of crates and barrels to crafting and character elements.  Additionally, the immersion level is amazing due to good voice acting, events, dialouge, buildings, and much more.  Camera control and zoom is great as well, and with these types of games I have found this to be quite lacking sometimes, yet Divinity fluidly pulls it off.

So at that point I had to say ... it was fun up till now... time to quit.... when the frustration factor/ Fun factor is like 3 vs. a good game that is .1, time to move on.  I hope with Divinity 2 they do a better job.  I read the same frustration with many playing the game .  However, I do see the real value in the game if you are one that does every quest and loves that kind of thing.  I did like the option to grow your character and use strategy when fighting your enemies (that was real plus).

We've had the original since it was in alpha and ironically mistook the nature of the game for something else (we thought itd be like skyrim lol). However, it still became one of our favourite games to play together. We're always looking for good co op games to play and I heartily recommend this game if you enjoy strategic co op rpg's.\n\nThis game was a wonderful bonding tool, and what made it so great for me was being able to play it with my best friend. The game is increasingly more fun if you play with someone else. I have many fond memories I can share with them and I don't think any game made me laugh so hard I cried actual tears like this one. Anyway we had fun playing through the still developing game several times over, and I'm happy with how the final game ended up.\n\nThere's alot of aspects to love, if you like crafting, this game has a nice and interesting system. The traits system was also original and interesting if sometimes a bit tedious, with me (the group crafter) having to look up wiki's on crafting and blacksmithing recipies.\n\nThe co op aspects are wonderful, there's a plethora of ways for you to intereact not only with your partner (should you have one) but also with the several characters you can get as followers. I found the combat to be spectacular, the different strategies you can choose from, different class routes you can choose lead to many possible combinations which give it good replay value. The turn based combat sets the pace at a very controlled rate, which is nice if you have other things going on, like texting a friend or if you need to take a snack/bathroom break. The game isn't demanding or needy like many other online games are.\n\nThe story is also very interesting and complex and has many twists and turns. The mysteries throughout it are captivating and kept me and my friend guessing for most of the game. The characters throughout the story are interesting and even though you influence your followers they have their own stories that unravel as you play. Your characters respectively become who you make them to be, and this affects how your followers behave and what kind of people they end up being.\n\nPoint is, this is a well developed game i've seen from the early alpha to the enhanced edition, and im very happy with how it turned out and how fun and original this great co op game is; one of the best co op games ive ever had the pleasure to playthrough.","December 27, 2015","true","79.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even the dungeon crawling, looting, and trap/secret detection is all very fun and rewarding.\n\nDownsides: Seems to crash a lot in multiplayer and have funny bugs. There's very little concise and definite information out there regarding crafting, skills, character builds, so you kind of just have to feel it out as you go.

You make a basic character and the great aspect is throughout the game you are building who your character is as a person using conversation which can assist with traits and abilities for the character. Its not your normal look i leveled let me add some things, its more then that because you converse with your party members while they talk to NPC or after decisions they make. you can make your party think the same or go against each ideology which is fascinating and there is mechanics built in for resolving conflict.\n\nThere is a challenge in fighting as when using magic or fighting enemies you really need to check your surroundings and know your elements. As combing spells or things around in the area can make a HUGE difference in combat.

The added controller support is excellent and extremely intuitive, and the split-screen/local co-op is aboslutely fantastic.  I know this had online co-op support in the original version, but I cannot think of another game that really plays off the co-op elements as well as Divinity does.  Quests can be tackeld in numerous ways depending on your build or affinity.  The fact that there are two heroes can be EXTREMELY entertaining when playing with a friend with a different attitude or moral outlook than yours.\n\nThe battle mechanics work well.  It's turn based, so it may be a turn off for some, but I found the combat very entertaining and satisfying.  Very, very deep skill system with your comman stats like STR, DEX, INT, etc., but also borrow a bit from fallout as you can gain "Talents" every few levels that are very similar to Fallout's Perk system.\n\nGraphics and sounds are top notch.  Fun factor is off the charts for any classic RPG lover.  Story is goofy, whimsical, adventerous, and serious all at once.  It strikes a really great balance between all those tones.\n\nCouldn't recommend the game more.  As you can see by my hours clocked I've spent a lot of time with it.

But let me highlight what I think make this game so enjoyable for me: <b>exceptional degree of freedom</b> + <b>tactical turn based battle</b>\n\nUse your skill almost everywhere, everytime, manipulate the environment, kill almost every NPC, multiple ways to solve the quest, split your party to solve puzzle out of the box. While there are other games that offers similar degree of freedom, Divinity: OS EE battle mechanics goes along very well with it giving you almost unlimited array of tactical options.\n\nI look forward for mod support to be implemented in the enhanched edition.","November 6, 2015","true","78.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Since the game is turned based, combat is slow, but challanging.\n\nEnemies often start first, and are sometimes invulerable unelss you have a magic spell to unturn them.\n\nEE has a few more perks, a very clean and satsifying ending.\n\nDon't underestimate perception, it can help show many things you missed as there are TONS of easter eggs in the game (something I regret since I was combat focused).  I don't know how anyone could play this game on heroic mode unless they knew 1000% what they were doing.  One thing that is annoying is the game should be almost renamed quicksave, as there are TONS of things (simple opening a door, digging up a whole) can lead to a massive explosion and a whole party wipe.  So you quicksave and load often to reset fights/encounters/conversations often limiting the challange of the game.\n\nSince dialogue paths are often linear, there is not a problem to just quickload.\n\nPuzzles and quests can be overly complex, and since there is NO HAND HOLDING in the game, it is made for pretty smart players imo.  Often you need the IGN walkthrough guide to help you out.  Even near the end where the stuff is new, you have to solve the puzzle by moving the statues on the 3 stone tabs and flipping the switch to reveal a mirror to flip a switch to a door (a puzzle in a puzzle in puzzle) lol.\n\nYes you might rage out a few times on tactician for those die hard for a challange, but the ending, and winning is more satsifying.\n\nI personally played this game for the immense challange of the combat it offers, and the bauldur's gate, pillars of eternity, D&D feel.  I still like Dragon Age Orgins more, but this is more of an indie route, and is reflected as such in the price.\n\nLooking forward to a sequel.  Game takes about 40-80 hours to complete, so well worth the price point if party strategy and extreme problem solving are your thing.\n\nWhat are you waiting for?  :)\n\n9 orc axes out of 10.","November 13, 2015","true","83.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Once upon a time my friend started playing this game and heard it was similar to Baldur's Gate, and knowing me he immediately bought me a copy of Divinity Original Sin.\n\nOne of the best gifts I have ever received. I never thought a top-down rpg could be considered next-gen in 2014 but just about every feature in this game is astounding. spectacular graphics, although the models are a bit cartoony.\n\nThe Turn based combat was the only part of the game that qualifies as dissappointing, but it was very well done, and very tactical and dynamic, and I enjoyed it.\n\nThe story is incredible, it's pretty lengthy so you get to enjoy it for a while, and it's very suspenseful and mysterious, with some great, creative and unexpected twists. A very interesting feature is how you role-play as two characters, which adds fun to multiplayer if you decide to co-op the game. Your two main characters are often confronted with difficult decisions and they debate about them and the way they interact with eachother impacts the game moving forward. And the overall theme of the story is very creative, and is definitely superior to the average RPG story theme of "the bad guy wants to watch the world burn and you are going to stop him."\n\nGameplay is very, very good, lots of puzzles, riddles and quests that I found both extremely difficult, but also extemely fun to solve. Some of the quests, like solving the murder in Cyseal at the beginning of the game, were so lengthy and so difficult that I felt like a real master mind detective after finishing them. Character building is very good, a lot involved in planning and strategizing your 4 party memebers and optimizing their capabilities and strengths and weaknesses. The game has a very well made, and extensive crafting system as well, but I would recommend not using it extensively because I made a lot of epic equipment for my party and it made the game too easy for me.\n\nThe game world is very well made, aided by the interesting story, and amazing graphics. The world is very interesting due to the creativity of the way the 4 different very large areas are layed out and contain different environments (desert, forest, plains, city, mountains, etc.). And the many different kinds of enemies and monsters you encounter throughout the world, and last but not least, the world is very large, it took me roughly 100 hours to explore the whole game plus the essential main storyline areas.\n\nLast but not least, probably my favorite single feature from this game, was the music. Music adds so much enjoyment to a videogame, and this is one of the best videogame soundtracks I've heard. Personally it has, in general, the best roaming music and the best combat tracks (which added even more enjoyment to the somewhat dissappointing turn-based combat) of any game I've played. This soundtrack is one of the most extensive soundtracks of any game I've heard, there's A LOT of songs, so the roaming music and combat tracks don't really repeat a whole lot, and all of them are really good.\n\nIn conculsion, this game is a masterpiece, it probably would have gotten game of the year instead of Dragon Age Inquisition if it was released on console before 2014, but regardless, anyone who enjoys rpgs should give this one a try. And most who like rpgs are garunteed to love this game.","April 17","true","22.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elwisia/recommended/373420/","elwisia","Eri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elwisia/","156 products in account","Divinity: Original Sin started as a kickstarter campaign to become one of the best CRPGs I have ever seen, new and old. If you miss the old times playing Baldur's Gate, Shining Force, and the like, you will love this game. If you don't know what those are, but are a fan of RPGs in general, you will love this game. If you ever wondered what D&D would look like if it was created for PC in 2014, you will love this game. In short, you will love this game.\n\nPros:\n\nCombat is extremely fun, the AI is (comparatively) smart, and there's no shortage of enemies of all kinds. As expected, the battlefield plays a big role in combat as well, and either side is able to mold it to their advantage;\nThe story is great, if a bit cliché. But it's nonetheless well written and will make you overlook the boring aspects. There is also a good amount of humor in the game (the good kind, not the meme kind);\nIncredible depth in character growth and customization. You can be anything you want. Choices are also part of your character growth, depending on your dialogue choices, or how you decide to finish a quest. Expect to spend a lot of time deciding which build you want to go with. Such is life, and you will love it.\nThe out of combat puzzles are a challenge of their own. It takes more than brute force to get through the game, and that's a wonderful thing. This game truly makes you think outside of the box sometimes;\nBecause of the way the game is laid out to you, every step you successfully advance feels rewarding. There was no dull part in the story, at least for me. Side quests and exploration provide an extra layer of rewarding feelings;\nYou can do LITERALLY ANYTHING you want. NPC looked at you funny? Burn him down. Boss is boring you with its monologue? Switch characters and smite him right in the face. Vendor has an item you want but you can't afford it? Pickpocket him. Or just kill him too. Who cares. You're the boss. You go you;\nOnline and local co-op support. Because sometimes doing everything your way alone is boring. It's also extremely fun to co-op if you're a roleplay person. The game was developed with co-op in mind and that's the right way to play it.\nCons:\n\nDue to the length and nature of this game, playing co-op if you don't have a friend to compromise and play with you, or can't find a partner for that only purpose, is nigh impossible. The in-game lobby was empty every time I looked. And, at the time of this review, it's a less than 5 months old game;\nThe beginning of the game is extremely tiring. You are sent by some people to some town to do something, defeat a couple of enemies on the way, and your next 5 hours or so are spent walking around the town talking to people. It will catch up after that, but a lot of people give up before it happens;\nThe characters in this game are obnoxious. Every. Single. One. Of. Them. NPCs will repeat the same phrase every two seconds if you're near them. N/PCs have awful personalities. I guess it's somewhat justified since they've lived awful lives, as you come to find out, but for me, as a player, I've left PCs out of my main party because they were so annoying; Quiet day on the market my bum.\nCombat in this game actually gets easier the more your progress. This is due the fact you have access to highly overpowered skills later on, and I'm talking "wiping the whole enemy party in one shot" kind of OP. There is a point where defeating enemies stops being a challenge and becomes a chore.\nNot exactly a con, but the $40 price tag (+$30 for CE) for an indie game may scare some people off. And since it's a relativaly new game, don't expect huge discounts any time soon. There is also no option (that I know of) to get CE via Steam after having purchased the base game;\nA few things that are not game mechanic related, but still noteworthy:\n\nDespite the scary price, when you purchase the game you will receive copies of both the Enhanced Edition, and the Classic version. While they are technically the same game, there are enough differences to make a second playthrough worth it to some people;\nThe Collector's Edition will give you one extra copy of the game, that you should gift to a friend who uses the price as an excuse not to play with you. They will also receive copies of both versions of the game (but not copies of Beyond Divinity and Divine Divinity);\nCross Platform co-op is possible only between Xbox One and PC players, and only if the PC player is using Windows 10.\nDivinity: Original Sin is a game I would reccomend to everyone, as long as they don't hate RPGs with all their might.","March 18","true","199.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

They replaced the original game with the Enhanced Edition, so I felt the need to come back and rewrite my review. The original game was an absolute masterpiece on so many levels, and I was shocked that the Enhanced Edition could take the game even further. The game now has so many new features, a revised crafting system, a revised story, and is now fully voiced.\n\nAn absolutely beautifully crafted world that allows players to play how they want. There are multiple ways to complete most quests, whether it be through brute force, conversation, stealing, or whatever you can think of. The options are only limited by the very generous game mechanics. The depth of this game is absolutely mind blowing. I'm on my third playthrough and I still find new things I hadn't discovered before and new ways of doing things. The story doesn't feel forced either, it just glides along as you explore the world.\n\nThe turn-based combat system is wonderfully designed and allows you to win your battles using any means at your disposal. Go in head first, build a barricade out of objects you find around you, set a fiery trap for your foes... whatever it takes. Combine abilities to create battle changing opportunities, like slowing your enemies with an oil slick then lighting them on fire or electrifying a pool of water, stunning those that come in contact with it. Choose your tactics based on the character classes you choose for your party, of which there are many to choose from.\n\nOn top of all that, the co-op play is awesome. This game is a lot of fun on its own, but even better when playing with a friend. Work together and plan your attacks, solve puzzles, figure out quests... two heads are definitely better than one.\n\nFans of games like Neverwinter Nights, Dragon Age, Baldur's Gate, and Icewind Dale will love this game and should definitely check it out. Well worth its full price, and an absolute steal if purchased on sale.","November 4, 2015","true","70.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

How you use the environment (or how enemies use it against you) can easily turn the tide of a battle.\nDetailed artwork and a well-crafted world.\nPlentiful waypoints for fast travel between locations.\nIt seems that almost every line of dialogue is voiced, and most of it is very well done.\nThe music is well-done, and will at times get stuck in your head.\n50+ hours of entertainment (if you take your time).\n\nThe bad:\nUneven pacing. Ending felt disjointed, rushed, and underwhelming.\nA few buggy quests requiring quicksave/quickload to allow dialogue options to continue.\nInventory management is a chore.\nBe prepared to abuse quickload to win games of RPS. You can be the most charming person in the world against somebody with the charisma of an ugly bridge troll and still lose RPS.\n\nThe ugly:\nI killed the final boss in 1 turn using only half my party. Decidely anti-climactic.\nSpells and arrows often get blocked by objects and topographical features of terrain. Very annoying.\nEnhanced Edition version of the "puzzle" to enter the Source Temple was a royal pain. As was the "puzzle" in the temple itself.\n\nStory ✩✩✩✩\nGameplay ✩✩✩✩\nSound ✩✩✩✩✩\nGraphics ✩✩✩✩✩\n\nBottom line:\nBuy if you enjoy CRPGs. I got 60+ hours of entertainment.\n\nP.S. I played this both on a gaming rig with a Radeon 290 @ 1440p and on a laptop with a i5-5200U + Intel integrated graphics @ 1366x768. Game ran acceptably on both.

Many games, mostly AAA console-focus titles, advertise player choice as a selling point, but few get it right or even live up to it. You can finish almost every quest in any which way you want in any order. An NPC will only give you an item to progress further by completing a quest you dont care to do? Just pickpocket it off of him/her with the necessary skill level. An NPC have something with awesome stats in their inventory? Sneak around and rip if off them or from their house. Be a good person, bad person, or something in between.\n\nThe various elements that can be wielded in this game was a splendidly refreshing new mechanic to play with. Poison, earth, fire, air, water, etc can be utilized and combined to give you very interesting strategies to give yourself an upperhand in combat, especially when fighting more enemies than you can handle or enemies several levels above you. Lay down poison or a poison cloud for either damage or area denial and once youve maximized its use light it on fire to blow up anyone inside it thus converting poison to now buning damage. Lay down fire to burn enemies and extend its coverage to throwing more oil around the area and if you want to change that then put some water down and itll create a smokescreen blocking all line-of-sight. Much more can be done, but Ill keep this short.\n\nI never thought this game would have lasted me over 80hrs. Outside of combat there was plenty to do through big and small side-quests. And they had substance whereas many games by shallow devs/pubs add boring, trivial quests to pad game length. Also, puzzles and traps were everywhere. Either through riddles, hidden switches, hidden hatches, etc. I am psyched for Divinity: Original Sin 2","February 7","true","84.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It does have some frustrating aspects however. The quests are poorly written and don't usually give you enough information to continue them when you reach a milestone. Expect to spend a lot of time looking up the next steps in your favorite search engine. My other gripe about the game is control of the characters. It's very easy to accidentally grab an item that flags you for stealing, and you will perform a lot of unintended acttions in combat. I have mixed feeling about recomemmending this game, but it does have a lot of good qualities to go along with the bad.","January 8","true","15.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Even though after a while all fights are more or less the same (and enemies only have the abilities you can get, so it usually feels you're always fighting the same enemy. Even if it's a hellhound or something it can still only do the same stuff you can do, so it may as well be a "player character" dressed as a hellhound, demon, guard or whatever)..\n\nThe story is ... stupid. There you go. It's stupid and childish. It starts out great! a murder mystery, a town full of suspects and in dire straights, attacked from all directions etc... But then it sort of goes bananas with silly mythological ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and the motivations for both hero and villain are so ridiculously over the top you end up just thinking how idiotic it all is instead of being engaged by the story.\nSo it's pretty much the combat and character development that keeps you in.\n\nAll in all though, for some strange reason, it's still a good game.\nIt has a lot of character, some cute puns, and overall, fun.\n","April 1","true","76.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Shiny graphics, crisp sound, 2 customizable avatars. But then the ugliness arrives.\n\nThe biggest part of the game is designing the right party setup. Do you want a balanced group, a melee-heavy group, a caster group, or rogues and archers? The game is highly difficult, even on normal, and you need your party members to do precisely what you want, in order to get anywhere. But the game immediately pours ice water on you by not allowing you to customize your two additional companions. So if you have the perfect setup in mind, you now have to work around the garbage skills your 2 companions bring. (Lone Wolf is a joke btw.)\n\nYou venture forth with your less-than-ideal group of 4 adventurers. You try to (as much as possible) avoid the uninspiring and unfocused story (from a murder investigation to saving the world from an existential threat -- really?), instead opting to focus on combat and skill development. You stave off nausea and turn off the voice so you don't have listen to the ungodly blend of Southern / Scottish / Irish / British accents in the awful voice acting.\n\nYou quickly realize that even though the game is supposed to be open-world, it really isn't. There are many choke points blocked by creatures too high-level for you, so you have to double back and look for something you can defeat. No such luck. So now you go back to the story. You spend hours trying to find that next scripted event that will move the story forward. Except it's nowhere to be found and you're forced to google it, realizing it was some tiny detail you missed, whose connection to the story makes no logical sense whatsoever. You will be constantly "stuck" on certain quests you didn't realize you have to put on hold until a much later point.\n\nThe game touts the flexibilty of the classless system and your ability to be whatever you want. Except you must live with (and regret) your skill investment decisions every step of the way. The game uses diminishing returns to essentially force you to make balanced characters (i.e. spreading your points across several skills / stats rather than focusing on a few), but balanced characters are actually horrible (attacks miss all the time, spells fail, longer cooldown, can't equip items, etc etc). In the end, after restarting the game dozens of times, you realize you had to specialize after all.\n\nAll in all, an aesthetically pleasing game (sans the voice acting), with questionable design choices.","April 22","false","121.9"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","0"

However, it is the sort of game that you will only like if you are a specific sort of person. Yes, it plays well as a standard tactical rpg game that allows for an awful lot of linear thinking in how you combat scenarios, but in reality, it feels a lot like a pen and paper rpg that has been streamlined so that combat doesn't feel so clunky. Of course, there are some limitations due to the medium, but this is probably the best game I've found so far for giving a feel of freedom in how you go about things and what sort of character you're playing.\n\nYou will enjoy this game if:\nYou enjoy highly challenging tactical rpgs\nYou enjoy storywriting/pen and paper rpgs and are prepared to make a character (or two) and then have them interact with a highly dynamic world\nYou enjoy dishonoured/deus ex like freedom/do it your way style games. Seriously, there have only been one or two occasions where I felt like I wanted to do something that the game didn't permit (one of them was jailing somebody that the game only allowed me to kill or allow free).\n\nYou will not enjoy this game if:\nYou do not enjoy the pace of the game slowing down for several hours at a time as you talk to NPCs, investigate murders, interact with the rest of your party, etc.\nYou like fast paced games and games with twitch combat (combat is turn based, top down, but movement of characters and interaction with the environment is almost totally free).\n\nKey features of the game:\nPen and paper like freedom, or at least, the best game for that sort of thing I've ever seen\nHighly challenging strategic combat with an awful lot of linear thinking (for example: a friend and I spent a while trying to get past a handful of quite challenging orcs... after a while, I teleported an oil barrel onto them, then he ignited it with a fireball. Similarly, teleporting the flaming zombie into the river proved quite effective, and a burning boat was saved by using a rain scroll).\nSlow paced gameplay at times\nDynamic NPCs, ala Skyrim\nSkills that practically scream 'use me in or out of combat'\nEngrosing storyline\nInteresting interactions between protagonists","January 1","true","44.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So far it has been one of the best purchases ever. The game can be somewhat slow depending on how well you like to plan engagements but it is challenging. Normally my friend and I play on hard, but the normal setting in this game is proving challening enough. The normal enemies are ok, but the bosses are a pain in the ♥♥♥. At the time of writing I have almost 25hours invested in this game and I'm not out of the first area. Great value and fun for the money paid (€24).

Not only is the writing hilarious and the mechanics solid, but the memories you'll take away playing away with friends is the real gem. We still laugh to this day about the time I tried hiring a hooker and ended up getting a bed time story, and of my jealous friend who hired his own hooker who ended up being an assassin.\nSeriously, even if this isn't your normal style, if a friend asks if you want to get it with him and give it a whirl, dive head first into it. Do be warned though, this game might last you about 40-50 hours for one play through then its pretty exhausted unless you end up playing it with another friend.\nPlease excuse my very minimal hours in this game, for as like many others, my review pertains to the original edition that came out. The enhanced edition is definitely very optimized though, so if you've been hesitant in trying this out now is the best time to do it.","November 25, 2015","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I thought it would be a bit like torchlight, but it´s not! It has turn based rounds, and you can play with someone else online or co-op. There's a huuuge world to explore, so many things to interact with, huge character customisation for voices, build, classes, there are even pets in the game! I only played for 40 minutes but i'm super impressed with the art and the music, and just the overall look and gameplay. If you have a good friend (or a girlfriend if you're lucky, LOL) then you would love to play this together, seriously, go check it out. It's worth the full price, but now that it's sale, I reccomend you all to get it. There's also different game modes, I play on explorer mode which is less about combat and more about exploring. Also everything is voice acted, and your character and the other character (your friend/gf) have dialogue together! 10/10 would play for 100 hours","February 10","true","29.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Even minor dialogue choices affect your characters through putting tallies on certain personality traits that affect in-game bonuses. You're presented with a number of challenges that you can solve creatively, and the method you choose actually has some bearing on what kind of people your main characters become.\n- Combat requires you to think and manage resources, unlike many modern games that hand out health potions like candy and make it easy to get by without them to boot. The element system is a cool way of encouraging players to alternate their spells, using combos such as drenching the enemy with rain to set them up for a lightning attack. This aspect also gives wizards something to do in battle besides blast enemies, as their area spells are sometimes needed to clear up hazardous conditions so the party can advance or create hazardous conditions to deny routes to the enemy.\n\nCons\n- When I came into town, I met a cat wizard who likes turning into a cat and making cat puns. I figured he was the comic relief character. I now realize that they are all the comic relief character. Goofy characters and goofy writing constantly undercut the game's efforts to get you invested in the story. The setting actually looks pretty interesting (other than the hilariously-named "Sourcerers" and "Source Hunters"), but I can't bring myself to care. This is a particularly major flaw in a game that's supposed to be an old-school-style RPG.\n- There are some quirks in the combat interface that take some getting used to, and the one-click command system combined with the delay time after some combat animations makes it a little too easy to accidentally commit a character to burning all of his or her action points walking across the screen to a useless position or firing an attack spell off at a corpse or barrel. Despite being almost insultingly hand-holding at times, the tutorial doesn't talk much about the UI.","January 9","true","9.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, it is the sort of game that you will only like if you are a specific sort of person. Yes, it plays well as a standard tactical rpg game that allows for an awful lot of linear thinking in how you combat scenarios, but in reality, it feels a lot like a pen and paper rpg that has been streamlined so that combat doesn't feel so clunky. Of course, there are some limitations due to the medium, but this is probably the best game I've found so far for giving a feel of freedom in how you go about things and what sort of character you're playing.\n\nYou will enjoy this game if:\nYou enjoy highly challenging tactical rpgs\nYou enjoy storywriting/pen and paper rpgs and are prepared to make a character (or two) and then have them interact with a highly dynamic world\nYou enjoy dishonoured/deus ex like freedom/do it your way style games. Seriously, there have only been one or two occasions where I felt like I wanted to do something that the game didn't permit (one of them was jailing somebody that the game only allowed me to kill or allow free).\n\nYou will not enjoy this game if:\nYou do not enjoy the pace of the game slowing down for several hours at a time as you talk to NPCs, investigate murders, interact with the rest of your party, etc.\nYou like fast paced games and games with twitch combat (combat is turn based, top down, but movement of characters and interaction with the environment is almost totally free).\n\nKey features of the game:\nPen and paper like freedom, or at least, the best game for that sort of thing I've ever seen\nHighly challenging strategic combat with an awful lot of linear thinking (for example: a friend and I spent a while trying to get past a handful of quite challenging orcs... after a while, I teleported an oil barrel onto them, then he ignited it with a fireball. Similarly, teleporting the flaming zombie into the river proved quite effective, and a burning boat was saved by using a rain scroll).\nSlow paced gameplay at times\nDynamic NPCs, ala Skyrim\nSkills that practically scream 'use me in or out of combat'\nEngrosing storyline\nInteresting interactions between protagonists","January 1","true","44.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Story is interesting so far, the tactical combat is even better than back in BG2, there's lots of humor in the game and the co-op feature is really well designed, allowing me to share the experience with my GF as one of our favorite co-op experiences of all time.\n\nWhen I still can't recommend this amazing game, it's because the co-op has some of the most critical bugs I've ever seen, even 6+ months after the release of the enhanced edition:\n\nThe "minor" nuisances is that hp bars and initiative order in combat is consistently wrong on the client. We've gotten used to both looking on the host's monitor to see what the real health values are, and when each character acts in combat, but I imagine this will be quite the deal-breaker if you're not sitting next to your partner.\n\nThe true critical issue for us has been that the co-op saves break, making it impossible to continue. We're not talking the occasional game crashes (which are reasonably rare) but that we reach a state where the client will consistently freeze up upon joining the game. We were initially able to suppress the issue a bit with help from Larian support and then bypass it for a while by switching the save to the other computer - yet the bug has returned every time. We are now 35 hours into the game and unable to continue.

Because I am in a mood for cheese.\n\nI didnt love the original game as much, as I thought I would. Early acess looked very promising, but final release seemed to carry over most of its flaws: ragged storytelling, quite a few bugs, broken game mechanics (where basically combat turned into contest of cheese, rather than tactics). It did offer a lot, of course: open world, lots of freedom, charismatic characters (Talking to some of them, I almost felt back at Planescape: torment), original story, interesting combat mechanics and incredible campaign length. It was probably just me, but cons quickly outweighted pros, and I stopped playing 60 hrs into the game(which is still way more than I dedicate to other games and I hardly did 1/3 or the story) , thinking "not bad, but not polished enough to become classic"\n\nYear later Larian did just what it needed to turn DOS into possibly best RPG ever made (Personally I'd still go with Baldurs Gate 2). But is it just "polishing"? Well. No. It is a massive upgrade in every possible way, to a point where mainstory is changed (for the better), quest are improved, balance overhauled, more content, full voicing etc, you must have read all this in "features" section of steam store. However the scope of this, given how big this game already was, is nothing short of incredible.\n\nIn the end only problem I have with this game is that I cant pay larian for the second time.

Anything you say doesn't really seem to matter, because this is about them. You wish you could get back to work, you'd even welcome it, but they won't let you. This is just part of a really long and boring job. You can't simply avoid it, because they're your boss; a lot of people admire Divinity, who you can only assume are just as boring. You're stuck thinking to yourself  "If I wasn't obligated to work, I wouldn't." This is when I quit Divinity.\n\nThe game starts promising enough, giving you lore, about five battles to fight, and dialogue options. Then, you reach a port city, and your role-playing game turns into hours upon hours of exposition, point-and-click mysteries, and fetch quests. It's been three hours since I've done anything beside listen to NPCs, and there's still a lot more of it before I get to any sort of gameplay.\n\nThis isn't pulitzer prize stuff, either. Orcs, dragons, and fiendish macguffins are all the characters seem to talk about, and they talk about them more than you ever see them. Is this a game or a live storyboard proposal? Why am I being told about the world instead of seeing it and experiencing it? This game has good ideas and a great battle system, but wastes a home run chance with a overly long and dramatic wind-up swing. Now, with that out of place baseball reference with potential irony, I'm off to play better games.","December 20, 2015","false","4.0"," 41 of 87 people (47%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","47","41","87","9","5"

A game which you can't even pretend to be skilled at since your opponent HAS no psychology, and it doesn't even pretend to not be playing RPS for real (i.e. you never pick the same thing, so I guess it just decides who's going to win, and your choices are meaningless).\n\n2) Every time you accidentally click on something red, everyone immediately hates you.  Who decided on that?  Sometimes, they'll give you warning before they really REALLY hate you, but I hope you save often.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Velarra/recommended/373420/","Velarra","Vel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Velarra/","11 products in account","This game is no longer wretchedly awful as it was at release about a year or so ago. Even if the legion of fanboi's who supported its development at the time, swore up and down, violently confronting anyone who didn't join their blind, fantatical praises that it was the best thing since sliced bread. It no longer feels like a half baked, rushed tech demo developed by Iceland's CCP with a hacked on multiplayer element.\n\nIt feels more like the Divinity RPG games that came before it. Years before it. The reason? It finally -knows what it is- and functions well enough. The initial amateur hour rushed development elements seem mostly tended to. There are issues and echoes of old school gaming, and not the good variety. To list them all out would be hair splitting however. A tiny UI issue here, a mild graphical glitch there and so on.\n\nIf this game is missing one critical thing it is a true character level view point that can be played from full time, be it 1st person or 3rd person. See KOTOR's camera view options for reference. Yet critically, i suppose that's personal taste and not an outright fault of the game.\n\nIn closure before buying this game, be extremely sure you know what you're buying into. Personally i still loathe this game. If i could have a steam refund tomorrow i'd take it in a heartbeat. But it's not a bad game any longer. If you understand what the game is, buy it, play it with a friend and enjoy. It's finally worth a look.\n\n----- Comments reply:\n@Slimebeast :\n\nWhen purchasing the game originally, and even now, many of the advertised still image pictures feature a very close-in image of the characters you play. I got the impression one could play and view the characters like that 24/7. But the camera frustratingly does not make that possible while keeping the game playable. It's just a nice, partial zoom-in view mode. You don't even have a fully free-camera from that perspective.\n\nYou can not play the game from a more typical perspective as in games like KOTOR. Please do note too, that i don't mind turn based combat. I don't generally enjoy FPS RPG's that lack turn based play. I don't even mind occasionally zooming out for a more isometric, distant view point / range.\n\nYet when wandering around? Exploring the setting, interacting with AI npc's? The game plays better from a distance. The zoom in mode is useless, and leaves a distasteful sense of the game being a tease as regards the player's immersion. It's as if it teases a semi-1st person mode and then pulls it away once you're there. Which is a thoroughy terrible UI experience.\n\nThat is why i loathe this game. I could complain about tiny things like inventory management too. But those are minor. Perhaps even 'genre authentic'.\n\nHowever, as long as a person's expectations are acutely prepared / aware of just how this game will play, how the camera does actually work...All other early release bugs, annoyances and so on of the non-enhanced version seem to taken care of. Grade A dev work!\n\nThose early issues dealt with, the game is fine, i'm happy reccomend it. Really. It's just not truly for me. If i could get a refund i'd take it. I'd even give my license for it to a friend if i could, if i knew the friend would like the game. I personally, just dislike the bait and switch sensation of the camera UI.","October 31, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","6"

This game just pisses me off. The combat difficult was spastic, with some fights being incredibly easy due and some incredibly difficult based entirely on the luck of the dice role, rather than your skill or tactical abilities.\n\nThe combat takes ages because you have to watch every character do every action in excruciating slow motion. The pathing will get "stuck" and sometimes you'll be sitting there watching an enemy character take up to a minute to decide that he can't move anywhere, and then watch the same character do it again. Every turn.  The controller controls are awful, hope you like dying on lava. Your minion's pathing is just as bad, and they will randomly walk onto lava as well.\n\nYou *need* to level up your perception to finish some of the final puzzles, so I hope you picked a character that has high perception or you'll have no idea that there are switches 2 feet from your face.\n\nSometimes you have to end your turn by holding down a the b-button. Sometimes it auto ended your turn and you just skipped your next character's turn.  The pyramid/teleporation scheme of getting past random locked door is awful, because sometimes it works and sometimes the "path is blocked" and you can't tell whether it will or not until you try.\n\nYou'll see an enemy use a dispel on your summons with astounding success, so you track down and grab that spell only to discover that it only works on some of the enemy's summons with no reasonable explanation as to why.\n\nThe dialogue interface is terrible. For everything else, the b button gets you out of it, except dialogue. For that you must select the "appropriate" option, which is usually the last one. Except when talking to your companions. In that case, the last one is to dismiss them from the party. Ugh!\n\nI could go on, but this is plenty. The game is far from perfect and not the bastion of the perfection that so many other reviewers hold it up to be.","May 11","false","83.3"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","5","14","0","1"

The story is not interesting for me, some how it feels too childish and not deep enough to keep my interest. I could maybe live with that but also the combat is too easy for me, except in one boss fight where my team gets hit right from the start before it was my turn with a  huge scripted aoe fireball which killed on several tries usually half of my team leaving other with very low hp, had to reload from save and start the dialogue with only one character and leaving other characters out of reach of the fireball. If you are experienced with RPG's I recommend you to play on tactician level because the Classic mode is way too easy with all the cc available.\n\nOtherwise the combat is pretty enjoyable and there are interesting combinations with the skills that you can play with.\n\nThen there is the crafting which is annoying because the inventory is so cluttered and your resources are scattered between many chars and you have to move them between the characters and I just hate all that kind of inventory management in solo RPGs which just takes a lot of time and gives very little back. Also you get so much loot from the world and you will be swimming on money so you can usually get good gear from your explorations and from merchants.\n\nAlso at some places the NPC chattering is very annoying, they keep repeating their dialogue non-stop which becomes very irritating quickly and makes you want to mute the sounds. So if you are going to do some inventory management, find some peaceful spot without annoying npcs talking all the time.","May 15","false","49.6"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","30","3","10","3","0"

Why? Here are ten solid reasons why this game is moving in the WRONG direction:\n\n1. Camera changed for console (the camera will also force tactical when you get to close to the edge of the map now, a cheap way to hide areas of the map that are still not textured while claiming it has been) Having a locked camera that you could zoom in and out was in fact better (unless you are playing with a controller/console and want to constantly have the camera on your back...) as having the camera jump up and around whenever you get near the map border make it painfully difficult to navigate, not to mention "mis-clicks" for attacking now happen much more frequently.\n\n2. The game that stood apart because of all the different classes and builds that you could play with now has been simplified and nurf'd for console players- over two dozen skills have been removed alone, around a dozen new ones added for a difference of still over a dozen. Talents, builds, load outs have been nerf'd across the board and what you are left with is around 2-4 working builds...\n\n3. Unique voice actors have been replaced with the very stale, repeated, and cliche' "old English" voice actors. Everything now feels like it is in some "wannabe European city" as the voices range from "russian" to "old english" to "weird Euro". The only voice actor/actress remotely "American" anymore is Madora, who happens to be voice acted by "the very best fake southern accent they could find in europe..." Madora also happens to be a bigot and a racist... Classy Larian, super classy...\n\n4. The story has changed from "sparse but worthwhile" to "heavy but shallow". You now have new areas that have been created just for the EE that in some cases are just long hallways for you walk through before opening a gate to finally reach "the end" screen? The story was always sparse, but what was there was decent, it never felt "unfinished" or "rushed", just sparse. In the EE you will find entire areas that feel like this, you will be asking yourself "did they just not finish this? why did they even add this? was this rushed? etc etc etc". Also, Arhu will now show up every five minutes to hold the players hand, explaining how to breath using your lungs ("in, and out... goooood source hunter!") even though it makes zero sense, furthering the fealing of "heavy" (it is always in your face, never giving you chance for immersion) while being shallow as they come (Don't ask why Arhu is here... and here... and here!).\n\n5. Large groups of enemies/mobs have been removed and replaced with cheap/boring/poorly done puzzles. Don't get me wrong, puzzles in the original never were that great, but the combat in DOS has always been top notch- so I ask, why remove countless mobs and replace them with MORE crap puzzles? The end game now has more puzzles, frankly the entire game has more 'puzzles' now (by "puzzle" I mean "move very slowly and disarm trap, after trap, after.... gasp* after trap...) and none of them are fun, all of them are tedius, and every single one removes from the real fun- combat. The last area of the game taking the biggest hit, with somewhere around a half a dozen unique "mini bosses" being removed with their mobs.\n\n6. Larian's DOS; Enhanced Edition forums do not have active moderators. You have a problem and want to use their forums? Best of luck. You have around a half dozen to a dozen very helpful players (myself included) who try to help but the flaming/chaos in the forum is not, NOT acceptable.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/373420/discussions/0/451848855024809803/\n\n7. Divinity Original Sin was a PC game, and vs other PC games it was great. The EE turned the game into a console game, top to bottom, and vs other console games it is a dime a dozen. DOS:EE took one step forward, two steps back, and one to the side from the Original, if you want to try this game and have not yet, I would strongly recommend playing it on console, for that is what this game is now, a "console game" best played with a controller. Another example of this in game? In the original you had white (non magical), blue (weak magical), green (stronger magical) and gold (strongest magical) items while in the EE you have white, blue, green, pink, purple, yellow, gold, different gold, gassssssp*.... Got to throw a MILLION DIFFERENT COLORED ITEMS AT PEOPLE TO KEEP THEIR ATTENTION! What a waste of resources!\n\n8. Less mobs,and thus less things to kill mean less experience. In the original you could easily end up lv 22, in the EE you will end up at 20. For an RPG that is built around combat, the almighty level, and crafting your champions, taking 10% of that away from the player is yet another stupid design choice geared most likely at console players.\n\n9. New things were added and guess what... gasp* they are all GROSSLY overpowered! Dual fighters will crush all! Grenades will make the early-mid game a joke even on the highest difficulty! By "balance" what they meant was "NERF the living $#!T out all the smart things the game had and make cool things like GRENADES and DUAL SWORDS... SUPER AWESOME FOR CONSOLE PLAYA'S!" The game frankly has never been more unbalanced since early beta...\n\n\n10. Crafting is now more tedius then ever, there is even more junk to fill up your inventory with (a million keys for one), and you still can't auto-sort or name your backpacks! In the original you just dragged and dropped items on top of eachother to craft, and then moved the slider to choose how many you wanted to make; in the EE you have to go into your inventory, click on "crafting", click on "recipes", click on the subfolder that contains what you are looking for (ie. "arrows"), click on the item you wish to craft, click craft, move the slider to determine how many you wish to make. Also, some crafting involves items in the world (ie. unique furnace) that will not show up in your "recipes" so you will now have to click individual crafting 100+ times if you want to make something like "Tenebrium Bars" at your homestead. Once again, why was this done? Because you can't "click and drag" with a controller, so PC players have to now spend 5x longer crafting because of a controller issue? Also, you can't click and drag craft AT ALL in the EE, just to make that clear...\n\nThe original (Divinity Original Sin vs Divinity Original Sin Enhanced Edition) is still worth the investment and is a solid game for PC, so I would still strongly recommend buying the game (Enhanced Edition) but playing the Original instead (Purchasing the EE now gives you a free copy of the Original). There are plenty of reasons why the Original was fantastic, you can read reviews to understand why, as far as the Enhanced Edition? As far as a PC game goes I would not recommend, if you wanted to get it for a console/controller play then dive right in, this game is now a dime a dozen and you will probably enjoy it a lot.","January 2","false","317.5"," 40 of 90 people (44%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","44","40","90","6","0"

I've played all of the Divinity games, but I'd rate this the lowest alongside Beyond Divinity.\n\nThe game has decent combat, audio and graphics, but is, in my opinion, lacking in most other aspects.\n\nMy main interests in RPGs are mainly story, interesting character/locales, dialogue and optimizing builds/stats. The game doesn't satisfy on any of these areas. The story is a generic and farily lackluster fantasy tale that doesn't serve to invest you into the game. The characters, with a few exceptions like Arhu and Jahan, are forgettable. The locales are standard fantasy fare without anything standing out. There's also a lack of a world map to put the areas of the game into any sort of geographical context which is really hurting immersion into the gameworld.\n\nThe writing is mostly decent, but with an unfortunate focus on "funny" dialogue. I know that Larian loves to put humour into their games, but I feel this game is too far over the edge. The character generation and leveling process is nothing special, certainly not particularly unique in the RPG genre.\n\nAnother thing about the game that has puzzled me is the reference to the game being "old school". There is nothing old school about the game apart from the turn based combat.\n\nI'd suggest Pillars of Eternity for a much more satisfying, deep and old school experience.","December 15, 2015","false","91.2"," 38 of 86 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","38","86","0","0"

I'm now at the final stage and the only reason why I keep playing it is the couch co op feature (there simply aren't many story driven couch co op rpgs out there). But let's just list all the things I liked and disliked about Divinity Original Sin:\n\nPros: - Nice story at the start, the first map is beautiful\n- Character creation\n- Character classes and skills felt really good when I was low lvl\n- The game doesn't hold your hand and feels like an oldschool rpg\n- THE COUCH CO OP FEATURE, i wish more cRPGs would adobt this\n\nCons:- The story gets boring after the first map, I felt invested in the world maybe for the first few hours\n- The game tries to be funny and witty at times, but mostly fails at that and just breaks immersion\n- The character developement in terms of skills and gear gets boring after the first few hours - no new skills after a certain point (not even close to the ending), weapons are just the same few models with different effects, armor has a laughable amount of tiers and there is absolutely no variety in the look of different armor sets (1 lvl plate armor - just a simple breastplate, 15 lvl plate armor - the same breastplate as lvl 1, only this time with an oversized shoulder piece\n- Enviroment effects are a nice mechanic in combat, but in reality they are more frustrating than fun - the fields are imprecise at best. For example when your character just slightly touches a firefield with the tip of his foot for a split second - that's it, you are on fire now.\n- The combat was fun at first, but when you have to battle 10 guys - good luck waiting for your turn.\n- The AI is quite stupid - for expample when I manipulate an oponent to fight on my side, they often just stan around doing nothing.\n- The level design is aesthetically pleasing, but the hitboxes are plain lazy. Try shooting a fireball next to flag post or over a little stone structure - it'll get stuck on an invisible concrete wall 1 meter above the mesh\n- The quest log is a f***ing mess - you'll never find out if you've finished a quest or if you have to do anything. It's more like a diary, in which your character writes every stupid thing he encounters.\n- I've found the player home completely meaningless - I only returned there when the story forced me to.\n\n\nFinal verdict: mediocreAll in all this isn't a bad game - it was fun to play in local co op. I would give it a 5/10 with a slight tilt towards a final negative score. if it wasn't for the fact that I can play this with my gf on one monitor I would've stopped playing 70hours ago and never touched this game again - especially when there are way better old school RPGs out now.","February 11","false","78.0"," 7 of 21 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","7","21","2","0"

Do I recommend this game?  I don't know.\n\nThe character creation is a bit bare bones.  Class customization is somewhat interesting, but you cannot customize starting gear.  You get what the base class has, and you don't know exactly what that is until you start the game (you can get a vague idea by looking at the character).\n\nFor a tactical turn based game, where precision is very important, the user interface is terrible.  Occasionally, clicking on a skill will not activate it, leading your next click to send your character astray.  The Esc key does not let you exit dialogue, meaning you cannot quickly exit dialogue in panic mode when your characters are rapidly dying (out of combat) and instead of healing your partner, you start talking to them, because when you clicked on heal, it did not activate.  If you do activate an ability, and then change your mind about using it, and click End Turn, instead of ending that character's turn, the character uses the ability at the area underneath the end turn button; very aggrivating.  Worse still, if you are attempting to melee attack, or ranged attack an enemy, you absolutely must hold down control and then click.  If you don't you run the risk of the enemy shifting around in place, causing your character to run up to or around it instead of attack.  I've had numerous occasions where my archer wasted his entire turn running to an enemy I was going to shoot because for a split second the attack indicator became a move indicator without me moving the mouse at all (especially noticable on the half eaten zombies).  On other occasions, I will click to melee attack only to have my character take a slow walk around the enemy, usually through fire taking ridiculous amounts of damage (as it ticks approximately 4 times).\n\nThe failure to activate a skill when clicking on it happens with characters as well, such as when I need to quickly change the character I am focused on, and nothing happens while I frantically click the character icon.  Sometimes I think I have clicked on a particular character, and then tell them to move, only to have the wrong character move - often walking them right through deadly traps, hazardous terrain, or right into a group of enemies I am trying to tactially position myself around.\n\nWhen trying to move a character around a tight spot, such as to avoid a known trap pressure plate, navigate around hazardous terrain, or avoid stepping into a vision cone area, the character often randomly diverts from the given path running directly onto pressure plates, through large swathes of hazardous terrain, or directly into line of sight.  Other times, pressure plates are triggered without the character actually touching them, by oversized phantom hitboxes.  When playing this game, I am often shouting either in my head or out loud at my characters "WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!"  Beyond that, party formation sometimes randomly changes.  For instance, in a recent battle I specifically selected a spellcasting character to move, put everyone in sneak mode, and put him in front, then cast the firefly spell, and when it actually cast, he teleported to the back, cast it from the back, and set my party on fire.  Which reminds me, it's often very difficult to determine if a given path will actually take you through hazardous terrain, or not, or when you are currently under a poison gas cloud (and the top down view is so awful I never want to use it).  Also the default run speed puts me to sleep.\n\nSo that's all of my griping about control precision.  Now for difficulty curve.\n\nFor context, I am playing this game in Honour Mode, the highest possible difficulty, where the two main characters dying = game over (even if the remaining character has a ressurect scroll?).  My first attempt, I narrowly beat the first battle where I was grossly outnumbered, made my way to some drunk legionnaires... decided to fight them.  How tough can two legionnaires who are drunk and only one level above me be?  The dog (also level 2) killed both of my characters in two rounds, there was no possibility of victory.  Basically 1 level of difference in this game is like 10-20 levels of difference in games I am used to.  Now I like hard games.  I do no death runs in Dark Souls.  I play Nightmare mode in American McGee's Alice... but this was just bull.  4 attempts later, I make it past the first fight again, make it into town, drag myself around the weird layout of the town for hours, eventually I am level 3.  I find some of the NPC dialogues to be quite entertaining, and some of them to be painfully boring and long winded.  I find myself two more party members, buy new gear... I'm feeling good about things.  I try to head west, near the beach, because I hear that is easier from NPCs.  The guards tell me I am too inexperienced.  I try various other gates, same warning.  After getting demolished by enemies one level above me previously, and being on Honour Mode, I heed the warnings... I have no idea where to go.  I search the internet.  There is a west gate in addition to a northwest gate.  It has level 3-4 enemies... so if I am lucky I will survive.  I nearly get obliterated right out of the gate by lightning zombies.  Scraping myself off of the ground I limp onward, fighting many harrowing battles where it is of dire importance that each action I take is deliberate and well planned out.  Several times, the controls try to get me killed by making my characters do things other than what I had attempted to command them to do.  I meet a dog, my witch can speak dog, and the dog says let's go beat up some wolves.  Sure, why not... The dog takes me to a completely new area (I was unaware of this at first because the only clue was that it stopped raining, little did I know that meant new area and not just a change in weather).  The dog immediately engages in battle with a whole pack of LEVEL 7 FREAKING WOLVES.  I quickly learn how the Flee mechanic works.  Back in town I recouperate, regroup, and head back out soon hitting level 4.  Hooray, progress.  I sneak up to an area and see a level 5 Ghoul surrounded by friends.  No thanks.  I find a well, go down it, there is a Rogue, but my party is full.  The area has level 2 enemies!  Damn, why didn't I find this sooner?  The fights are still hard, but they are manageable.  I've found a bunch of sweet loot, it's almost time for me to head back to town, identify things, sell things, buy things... What's this area?  I walk through a doorway.  Click.  Your party is dead.  Honour mode.  My save gets deleted.  Level 2 area, level 4 characters.  Apparently not taking that Rogue with you is not an option if you want to explore this level 2 area, even if your main character has the lightfoot trait.  So in closing, the difficulty spikes in this game are terrible.\n\nNow for one last thing that grates my nerves.  NPCs with ambient dialogue.  They repeat it incessantly, over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over.  It's horrible.  If you encounter an NPC that has only two lines of ambient dialogue, run far far away.  Do not barter with anyone near them, don't manage your inventory near them, just run.\n\nAside from those huge negatives, the game is alright I guess.  But I am only playing this game until March 8th.  I thought for sure I would fall in love with this game and play it for a very long time.  Not anymore.\n\nAs far as the story and the world building goes (I ran out of room, see comment below)\n\nOverall rating: 6/10","January 23","false","53.9"," 31 of 72 people (43%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","43","31","72","6","11"

On hard mode, this often means you'll have to redo an entire fight as every action matters\n-Fire and poison. Where do I even start on this? Not only do both do an absolutely ABSURD amount of damage, but walking even one or two steps through a fire/poisonous area will both afflict them AND do additonal immediate damage for traversing the area.\n-Utterly baffling mechanics. Zombies become poisoned when I attack them? This corpse randomly blows up for 85% of my health when I walk over it? This trap instantly vaporizes my guy, with no way to disable it or get around it? This person is healed by magic?\n-Horrible skill system. Combat skills mixed with magic skills mixed with crafting skills, with at least half of them being useless. The same can be said for the "talents".\n-Utterly pointless "sheath/unsheath" player states which exist for NO reason other than to punish the player. Accidentally have your weapons drawn and activate a dialogue option with an NPC, and then misclick the dialogue option? Hurray, they've now attacked you, and unless you can reload you can kiss any sidequests they are involved in goodbye. What awesome immersion.\n\n\nThe pacing is slow, the questlines are dull and obtuse, and are usually solved by accident rather than on purpose, as the game eschews any waypoint system. I can understand not putting waypoints for some kinds of quests, or leaving an option to turn them off, but forcing the player to wander needlessly? Stinks of lazy development.\n\nAnother game I wanted to like so badly, and when the combat works, it's great. But I don't want to play a game of "click the right pixel" and be more stressed about misclicking during a fight than the actual battle itself.\n\nOverall, this game feels like a beta in severe need of interface polishing and game balancing. I can tell that there's some great stuff buried underneath these issues, but the fact that the game is in this state means I find it nearly unplayable.\n\n6/10","January 20","false","16.0"," 8 of 24 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","8","24","0","0"

Moo!\n* Enjoyable battle skills for various classes.\n\n-\n\n* Too much time running about. Which will happen a lot, since there is no obvious direction where to go next. Now I could be forgiving about this. I don't mind sinking my teeth into some exploring or investigating. Yet with this little (on-level) combat encounters on the go, the running around gets tedious and frustrating for me.\n\n* I normally enjoy turn-based combat. It generally means you need to be strategic about your battles. But in D:OS EE the battles make me want to pull my hair out at times: especially with bigger amounts of foes, all their turns can take up so long I grab food, cuddle my cat & return later to see if I'm finally up (sometimes to find out I have to wait more). And if I died in the waiting process, I reload and play the waiting game again. Had I some battle strategy in mind to begin with, it now most definitely got lost somewhere... Luckily not all encounters have many foes, I did enjoy some fights.\n\nFurthermore I concur with several things posted before me. About the puzzles not really being puzzles, emptying bags nuisance, enemy clickbox nuisance, ambient voices repeating themselves, I can go on. Those for me are minor nuisances though, and would've gladly forgotten them, if I could find some kind of pace in the game.... in story progression or battles.","February 2","false","148.6"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","7","22","0","0"

Half the time there is no way to avoid these traps, and there is no way to disarm them (save expensive single use items and they don't do much when there are six traps in one hallway). You just trigger them and then very slowly walk around them trying not to die and having to heal yourself over and over again while your tankiest dude takes all the explosions. The amount of traps is just insane and it doesn't add to the gameplay it really just slows it down to a crawl. Some of these situations you will find yourself in will make you scream in rage at the sheer unfairness of the situations the game forces you into, like spawning a giant minefield all around you for pushing a button you have no choice but to push for example.\n\nThe crafting system...\n\nIt makes no sense whatsoever. You need blacksmithing to make armor and weapons out of metal, crafting for everything else. You can't even improve armor without the crafting skill, which makes no sense seeing as how you make it with blacksmithing. Crafting does literally everything else in the game that involves making things. Downsides you cant find resources after you go through an area once, so there are a finite amount of things you can find. Add a system that gives  you stats randomly on items you make and you have a session of crafting and reloading again and again to try and get decent gear. By the way you have no choice in this since crafting makes better gear than you will ever manage to find since random drops are horrid most of the time. I found a legendary weapon with 1 durability point and couldn't be repaired... why even have it?\n\nThe story\n\nIt's pretty bland, magic using bad guys are bad, you kill bad guys. Nothing really standing out here,\n\nThe biggest problem with the game by far, the most unforgiveable thing they did that makes the game damn near laughable..... NO TIMED AUTOSAVES!!!!\n\nRead that again NO TIMED AUTOSAVES.\n\nYou think its not a big deal till you lose yourself in a string of fights, get insta murdered when a ♥♥♥♥♥ character walks into lava for no reason, and then realize that because you havn't gone somewhere new in the past hour you never had a single autosave. It's downright insane that an open RPG in this day and age doesn't have timed autosaves. That's pretty much standard nowadays and the lack of one here is a real pain since you have to constantly remind yourself that you need to save. Add in the BS trap-a-palooza of instant death and you have a good recipe for frustration and rage.\n\nThe enemy spawning\n\nSomething else the game loves to do to you is spawn enemies seemingly at random. Go open a treasure chest? enemies magically appear, kill a specific enemy, more enemies magically appear, and the best part is when this happens, they tend to be suicidal enemies that explode for massive damage... No way to prevent it other than to already know when its going to happen.\n\nThe game is decent as rpg's go, and the closest thing to an updated dungeons and dragons game I've seen in awhile, but the flaws the game has just make it not fun to play. Save yourself the trouble and find something else.","December 20, 2015","false","61.7"," 40 of 96 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","40","96","0","0"

Frustrating to say the least when trying to complete quests. Some side quests started never finish until later on in the game with no real guide... also the game does not give enough hints in exactly what you have to do next... i found myself at times just wandering around just completing quests unintetionally and some quests i have had since the beginning with no real direction or subtle hints as to how to complete it.\n\nThe battle mechanics are a great concept. As always i love turnbased games.. annoying how in nearly every fight however i am always the second one to move... allowing all of the enemies to attack, freeze, poison, do a decent amount of damage before i am allowed to play making the iniative portion of a game broken in any respect. In tactician mode there were many times i had to save/load... if that it how the game is meant to work i find my best weapon against any enemy is to save\load and wait for a good roll in some batles.\n\nA very dark story for matire audiences but a choice to have a cartoonish childish artistic desgin??\n\nI will finish the game eventually but the only way to actually complete everything is to either playthrough a couple of times or simply do what everyone else does and wiki everything... the game is poor when providing direction on where to go next... and considering the level of some enemies and areas.. would have been helpful no?? I honestly tried to do my best in completing all of the quests without having to wiki but i dont have all day to play it.\n\nThe worst gripe i have is the inventory ui... absolutely dreadful... most of my time spend is cleaning up everyones items...\n\nother than that... the only thing i do like is the storyline and the battle mechanics... i would rate this a solid 6/10\n\nI turned the music off. And played some of my own collection in the back.\n\nI hope the sequal is better...","January 5","false","132.3"," 6 of 22 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","6","22","0","0"

Contrary to the popular views, however, I can't recommend this game  - at least to specific audiences.\n\nAs of 28 of October, I made a thread asking players of the game if I should refund it since it seemed unintresting to me. Despite the epic fan-boy rage and the usual Steam trolling, I managed to get several decent answers from normal human beings. My points were the following:\n\nCharacter Creation\nCharacter creation is ridiculously limited  (you get to choose between 7 preset heads/ 8 preset hair styles/ 3 preset underwear etc.  ALSO, there are annoying skin colors that have you be either pitch black, completely yellowish, or pale white - no middle solution).\nMoreover, the character portraits can't match your created characters' appearance which is quite weird since character creation itself is so limited that every hair color/skin combination could be included in the portrait  (You really call that "Enhanced Edition"???)\n\nAlthough minor aesthetics to some, for me, it really is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ having a white blue-haired character and being forced to use a black blonde-haired portrait...\n\nOn that,  people playing the game and know more about it commented that it is INDEED a WEAKNESS of the game , and they were hoping to see a better developed character creation on a sequel of the game.\n\nClasses\nAlthough I played for 4 hours only, it was enough for me to check out the early stages of almost all classes. Briefly, though, here's what happened: I made a Rogue and a Ranger; I couldn't pick up any skills other than the main 3 you get by the weapon's specialization so each character is the same at the beggining of the game. However, some classes can be more diverse, for example, Mages have the option to change and combine spells if you go Pyro and Water or Earth and so on. Thus, I found nothing interesting about the classes in this long and slow-paced beggining of the game, though I assume it does get better and more diverse as you progress.\n\nOn that, as the community agreed with me,  that is indeed another problem of the game: it unfolds painfully slow and boring during the first few hours of gameplay  (at least before you reach the first city and start exploring it). Moreover, it is  forcing  you at the same time to read every bit of text, dialogue, book retrieved, note discovered, npc whisper, that is thrown at you to understand what you have to do next,  literally spending more time navigating in the Pause Menu and your bags to, first, find what's important in the mess of the texts, and second, reading those texts and books and scanning your log to tell what is going on and what you have to do next.\n\nGameplay - Dialogues\nFor those who don't know, you create and control TWO characters.\n\nDialogues are plain awkward as well. You get to choose exactly what each of your characters says between each other, thus making no sense at all and making me question whether its a feature worth being included.\n\nHOWEVER, as pointed out to me by the community (in a rather  fan-boy kind of rage-tone) you can set the AI to treat the second character you control by itself on dialogues. "Great," I thought and tried it.\n\nHere's what happened:\n\nI wanted to recruit a feral-hunter woman for my party since I had a spot open and she seemed pretty good. Although I agreed with the guards to take her, the AI controlling my second character decided that it is too dangerous to have her with us. AND THATS IT. I succumbed to the AI. The AI chose the "no" dialogue, and the option to recruit the hunter ended there.\n\nHowever,  when I played while controlling both dialogues, I was able to make the second character gladly accept the new hunter on board, without any problems.  So, trying to have the AI control the second character and his dialogues ends up having you do exactly what he or she wants. You have to succumb to the AI and you can't do anything about it...\n\n\nGameplay - Combat\nCombat is awesome. And I loved the parts in which you have to use the environment in order to take down larger groups of enemies. However, at least in this boring and slow-paced first part of the game (as people who have finished the game agreed, I repeat!) combat is quite boring and everything is obvious (i.e. enemy stands in a weird pool of Oil or Poison, literally SCREAMING to be set aflame and exploded by you).\n\nThough, I can't comment more on combat since I didn't experience it fully.  (Nevertheless, boring at the first stage of the game from what I found).\n\nSumming Up Although I decided to keep the game, the hate and trolling I received were overwhelming. If you do love your game, and are so furious that I am going to write a negative review which will "ruin" it - as you said - then maybe help me like it as well instead of spamming  "Not for you, bb, you s*ck newb"  or  "too hard for you, go play games that spoonfeedz you omg omg!!"\n\nI know I am going to receive a lot of rage from the people stated above, and I want you to know that one of the reasons I decided to refund this today was the dissapointing community and the overwhelming  "omg newb refund it cya"  I received. Am I supposed to play multiplayer with these people?\n\nBottom line,  I can't recommend this game.\nI hope I've been helpful to you.\n\nPS: Thanks to those that tried to make me like this game and helped me out. To the rest of the raging "fan-boys," feel free to spam down-vote this review.","November 2, 2015","false","3.8"," 97 of 221 people (44%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","44","97","221","11","7"

However, they failed to build the game well.  Their alleged release of DOS on Linux, Mac, and SeamOS is a complete failure.  The game requires OpenGL 4.2 or above, even though it says 4.x in the system requirements, 4.0 and 4.1 do not work.  Also, at least 90% of standard-issue computers that run linux can handle a maximum of OpenGL 3.3, which doesn't even get close to the requirement set by the idiots here at Lairan Studios.  They failed to notice this fact, and released the game in a way that prevents most Linux users from being able to play the game until newer hardware is available.  And by the time that newer hardware is available, this game will be boring and obsolete.  So in essence, Lairan Studios are liars, and Divinity Original Sin is a stupid game.","January 19","false","102.6"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","3","16","0","0"

There game is huge and there are some good ideas buried in it so but a lot of it it just doesn't work for me, some of the reasons below:\n\n-no quest markers and an unhelpful quest log, this seems to be by design as you are supposed to actually listen to what NPCs are saying, which would be alright expect that...\n-annoying voice acting and bad writing, everyone is too verbose and tries too hard to be funny, the story is also slow to get going and when it does it's just a bunch of cliches\n-a few too many quests which rely on pixel hunting for tiny switches\n-crafting system is random and often nonsensical due to trying to be funny (lock picks = key and soap?), though you'll find a few recipes most you'll have to figure out by combining junk at random, which is made harder by...\n-inventory is a mess, can't even craft with another character's things, also there is way too much junk to pick up without knowing what's going to be useful\n-most loot seems to be of the Diablo style random variety, with only a handful of unique items\n\nOn a more positive note (though far from perfect):\n-the combat system is dynamic and reacts to the environment quite a bit, this is probably the game's strongest point but I found this to be a hindrance just as often with terrain features getting in the way of my ranged attacks or blocking my sight, and then having to slide the mouse around inch by inch to find the one spot where my shot or fireball would not get blocked\n-the combo system is also cool, though once you get down to it there aren't all that many useful combinations and it's hard to get different characters to synergyze (air mage wants things wet for the stun, but that puts out the enemies you set on fire earlier, and there's friendly fire so your figher gets hit too) and just as above you'll end up hindering yourself just as often (for example oil and fire creates an explosion and a fire field, but also smoke which stops you from targeting things in it on the next turn)\n-the character system gives you a lot of options and you can mix skills and abilities freely, though some combos are definitely better than others and there are quite a few trap choices\n\nAbove annoyances aside combat still manages to be the best aspect of this game, the spells and abilities look nice and do have some interesting and varied effects, and I can't say anything bad about the graphics and area design either. The game does look gorgeous overall and it is obvious a lot of work went into it, which has me conclude that even with the above faults this isn't some half ♥♥♥♥♥ indie effort, a few years ago I might even consider this a masterpiece, nowadays I expect more polish and quality of life features though.\n\nOverall this seems like a deliberate attempt to go old school, without understanding that those beloved classics games were great despite their faults, not because of them.","February 7","false","38.0"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","3","16","0","0"

It's turn based, but like every turn based RPG ever, it really isn't. Enemies just take turns whenever they feel like it, sometimes acting twice before you get to go once. You spend most of the time watching enemies move and attack while you do nothing. Every minor fight takes at least 10 minutes, often longer. There is a bar at the top that shows what order turns will be taken in, but its accuracy is laughable. You'll look at it, plan out the entire turn, and then watch as enemies take extra turns and yours probably gets skipped.\n\n2. There are too many enemies that heal and revive each other, with no warning that they can do so. Expect to spend 30 minutes mopping up enemies only to find out that the last guy left has the ability to revive every single one of them in one turn. Hope you had a quicksave before the fight started.\n\n3. Everything from the battle system to elemental interactions to crafting, trading, repairing, and identifying items has a complex system behind it that isn't like any other game. Sound cool? Maybe it is, but good luck figuring it out because the game doesn't tell you how anything works. This has to be the most user-unfriendly game I have ever played.\n\n4. There are quests that you can miss forever if you do the wrong thing.\n\n5. You have "choices" in quests, except you'll often be harshly punished for choosing wrong.\n\n6. There are a ton of side quests. Again, sounds cool right? Except there are literally a TON, with no indication of what order you should try to tackle them in, whether or not you can even resolve them at the moment, and whether it is a side quest or part of the main story. Your quest log will have 17 active quests in it. 9 of them will be impossible to complete at the moment, but you won't know that, you'll just run around wondering how you complete them. 3 of them will be possible, but you will eventually find out you are way too under-levelled to do them. 2 will be the main story, and 1 will be a sidequest that you are the appropriate level for. Good luck figuring out which is which!\n\n7. The story sucks. Just a bunch of generic fantasy stuff. Every character you meet has to blab a novel to you, and eventually you just start skipping all of the dialogue, which leads to even more confusion on quests.\n\n8. There are really important quest items that are very easy to miss and can be sold to vendors, dropped on the ground, etc. etc. with no indication that you will need them later to progress the game.\n\n\n\n\n","December 24, 2015","false","42.5"," 13 of 39 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","13","39","3","0"

I really dont like idea of only one save, it will not make game more fun.\nGame is good. First half. Second half is terrible. DO NOT TAKE LONE WOLF. Its overpowered. DO NOT COMPLETE SIDE QUESTS. you will leave monsters far behind by level. and as result, since ~14 level every encounter became booooooring.\nI cant believe to say it, but game will punish you for exploring and questing. Since mage get master spells... every encounter lasts maximum 3 rounds. For real.\nEndgame is terrible as ****. Countless puzzles... man, I buyed this game because its "deep" RPG and "deep" tactics. Not because of ***** stupid puzzles. They are totally ruined temp of game.\nAnd final boss... WTF?! REALLY?! 2 turns to kill final boss and he even dont have a single chance to do something!!!! Well, same for previous one... and previous..etc.\nWorst game ending ever.\nWell, to be fair for a first 14 levels game was pretty good and interesting. Every encounter required some brains to think. Play with environment was fun.\nI still can recommend to buy this game, but only on 50% sale. Because it woth to play only half of game. And in moment when you get bored (you will, i sure you) - feel free to drop the game, Because it will NOT get interesting while you progress.

There is more voice acting now, but they sacrificed quality for quantity, so I'd rather not have it than have to listen to these people talk.  The voice acting now sounds like the voice actors are making fun of the game.  Also, the random chatter loops that went off every 30 seconds before?  You thought those were annoying?  Some of them don't even have delays anymore.  They not only didn't fix the most annoying thing about the game, but made it even more annoying.  Some of the writing for the dialogue is worse, too.  It's like someone was trying to sabotage the game.\n\nUnless you have to play the game with a gamepad, I would stick to the regular edition.

They missed a whole lot of enhancements , like color correction , increasing the speed of the characters , the ability to create custom characters ( currently limited in the extreme) . texture and graphical issues , and so on and so forth , not a bad chalk board to start from but not a work of art either....wait for mod support before buying.....otherwise expect a bland , boring , dungeon crawler , it says it's over 100 hours , but that is because the game movement is so slow you could practically be lulled into a coma just by tryinig to play it as it is...at least if the color and textures where 'enhanced' you might have some scenery to be 'dazzled' by but unfortunately it was overlooked. for some strange reason....","April 2","false","1.1"," 2 of 16 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","2","16","0","1"

It lures you in with the promise of epic party-based adventure, but delives an experience like slogging through sewage. There are no quest markers or pointers at all, so 75% of the time you will be wandering around doing absolutely nothing because you have no idea what you're supposed to be doing or where you need to go to advance the story. That doesn't even cover combat, where everything you face is much stronger than you. This wouldn't be a problem if there were only a few mobs attacking at once, but they will swarm your party, outnumbering you 3 to 1 at least. You can't grind to get over that level disparity either, so good luck getting anywhere in the story. I have to say, I was really hopeful for this game. The story and the world seems great, but this game is unplayable at best. At worst, it feels like a scam. DO NOT play this game.

If taking the time to talk to everyone, touch everything, and try all approaches appeals to you then go ahead and buy this game. If you want to stand even a remote chance of getting it right without help then look elsewhere.\n\nMain quest? Forget about it. You have to do all this quest-meandering in order to get to the main one, and you can't even come close to completing it if you try to skip or delay something. You can't just walk around and level up until things become easier. That's mainly because the starting town is surrounded by certain death on all sides. Players are forced to complete things in a very specific order to progress in the game and there's no rhyme or reason to the order so players are forced into time consuming trial and error.\n\nImagine being stuck in a large trap and being given a choice of doors and behind the doors is another set of choices. You have to go to door three, then door one, then go back to start and choose door one, then door five. It just keeps going that way. You can't just figure out a way.\n\nYou have to play rock, paper, scissors with psychic NPCs to win some arguments and it's totally lame.\n\nThings like crazy design and dialogue decisions(really, Scarlett? Can you please be more consistent? Are you naughty or nice?!), nearly impossible difficulty, and completely nonsensical chronology with regards to the quests make me not recommend this game at all. It's such a shame, too! It's like a modern Baldurs Gate that is a massive pain in the butt to play.

"It's probably just bug fixes" we agreed as we made a rogue and a ranger. The new voices ranged from slightly improved to downright terrible, giving the impression that the good ending is achieved by turning the town into a Wasteland: End it all, ♥♥♥♥ This Edition, but we'll get to that.\n\nTo Divinity: Useless Update, Play the Original Edition's credit, there were some thigns added that made the game seem more polished, such as actual dual wield animations and removing the ability to save scum. Of course, this is all overshadowed by the abysmal and nonsensical changes to the actual game itself. Compared to Divinity: Bless its Soul, Almost Perfect Edition, Divinity: Someone Kill Me, I Need Professional Help Edition not only increases the difficulty significantly between the two normal difficulties of the games with archers that almost never miss and damage hiked so far up you need a high powered telescope to begin to make out how ♥♥♥♥ed you are and even making Phreak say "that's a ton of damage" to adding things that make no sense and make you feel as though you're playing the game where you took the Dungeon Master's girlfriend and burt down his house a few years ago and this is his chance to wreak his horrible vengeance on your puckered ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, like hard-shelled crabs that soul sap you (reducing all stats by 2 and resitances by 50%), cast AoE disease, have ranged attacks, and 4 shot tanks in groups of three or more with archer support.\n\nImagine you're playing Final Fantasy 8 and fighting Ultima Weapon, Now imagine that you're actually playing the "enhanced" edition, and now you have to send one of your party members away for 8 turns to operate some silly giant crossbow that can't be aimed to even have a chance at winning. You win, but your entire team is dead except for that one person. They go to loot the battlefield and find phoenix downs (because in the "enhanced" edition there are hardly any) but they get murdered by a pile of sentient gil. That's the kind of changes you can expect in Divinity: Did A Wrathbaby Make This Game Edition. Every boss encounter has some pointless mechanic that forces you to dedicate a character to some idiotic gimmick instead of actually playing to your party's strengths and weaknesses like a good RPG.\n\nDivinity: More Like Watching a Five Year Old Than Playing a Game Edition also has a serious problem with turn order. Repeatedly the turn order would shift, sending players and very rarely NPCs back down the turn order  with no reasoning, allowing others to go more often. My friend and I never found out the reasoning behind this, but Fallout 4's very own Todd Howard insists that Divinity: Just Playing a Very Intricate Bug of Fallout Edition "just works."\n\nI realize that I'm only talking about the bad things about Divinity: Original Bad, Sometimes Tolerable Edition, so let me go over all the good points. New abilities were added. I know that the exhaustive list of pros for Divinity: Such Innovation, Very Wow Edition can be a lot to look at but rest assured that it's not worth playing over the original sinful pleasure.\n\nMy friend and I, demoralized after a particularly broken, needless, and angry set of encounters decided the best thing to do was go back to Cyseal and kill everyone while our characters, who were certainly not vampires or african americans, made witty banter to each other about how justified their actions were then swiftly uninstalled the game after sacrificing our mortal forms to Arhu, ending our adventure in Divinity: Waste of 12 Hours, Should've Put More in the Original Edition.\n\nDo I recommend Divinity: IGN Wouldn't Give This Game a 9/10 Edition? Yes, if your intent is to waste your time or start your own "Rage Quit"-esque series like Rooster Teeth has or if you think pressing quickload is the most enjoyable experience that can be found in video games.","December 8, 2015","false","12.4"," 8 of 35 people (23%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","23","8","35","0","1"

Unfortunately, the "enhanced" edition is anything but.\n\nOn the positive side, bugs and mistakes were fixed. Many of them. But that could just as easily have been done without also spoiling the entire feel of the game. The game also has some visual improvements that are nothing to sneeze at, but again, it wasn't necessary to make the game goofy and WoW-ified to effect those changes. Mod support has also been removed, mostly meaning I must trudge around at the absurdly slow pace chosen for me.\n\nMost of the UI changes are just that - changes. They aren't improvements, and that's unfortunate, because they were one of the weakest points of the game. Now the spells and other abilities have big, 1990's iMac like bubble style tooltips in fruitlike colors that make information hard to locate. The inventory is still a bear to manage, with lots of manual arranging of hundreds of items distinguished only by their icons.\n\nOn the positive side, there is a crafting UI now, which does keep track of what recipes you've discovered, but doesn't do much more than that.\n\nThe voice acting has to be the worst change. The new voice acting is cringeworthy at its best. Now, when knocking down an enemy, I get to hear an awkward  "We won't be hearing from you for a WHILE", with emphasis on the word "while".\n\nThe changes to the story serve to make the game feel cheesy. The game came off as slightly campy before, with a bit of tongue-in-cheek, but now it's just embarrassing.\n\nIt's impossible for me to imagine how the changes were perceived as improvements at all, and if you have a choice, play the un-enhanced version for two hours before trying this one. You might find that you don't find the "enhancements" to be worthwhile.","November 7, 2015","false","24.2"," 12 of 45 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","12","45","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orchidsky/recommended/373420/","orchidsky","OrchidSky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orchidsky/","261 products in account","I really wanted to like this game, but there’s no way around it. This game is bad.\n\nI’ll start with the gameplay, which for me is the most important aspect of any game above all. I’d like to preface this part by saying that I enjoy difficult games. I liked the original XCOM and the new (in which I gave up classic ironman mode after 30 attempted playthroughs due to frustrating bugs), Master of Orion 2, Dark Souls, Ninja Gaiden, and the Megaman series. With most RPGs such as Dragon Age and Shining Force 2, I usually start with turning up the difficulty to hard. I’m not even saying that I’m particularly good at these games, merely that I enjoy playing games at this difficulty level. So please believe me when I say that even at normal difficulty, 90% of the combat encounters in D:OS are unfairly balanced and unsatisfying.\n\nThe enemies almost always go first, so most of the pacing of the game is dictated by the AI. When you do wipe and have to reload (for the first 8 character levels, for me, it was probably an average of 1-3 times per fight), it’s usually due to not knowing some gimmick or some powerful ability, or because of the sheer amount of damage the enemies put out. It’s not unusual to have to reload a fight because you didn’t have the right resistance potions or buffs pre-loaded, so you wind up with your knight dead in the second round, or your entire party AoE’d down to 33% in the first round, or half your party disabled for two rounds. Therefore, success relies mainly on making preparations based on the party wipe you just reloaded from—it’s unlikely that you will be able to adapt to the nonsense thrown at you in the very first encounter.\n\nAn example of a fight that’s impossible to adapt to the first time around is a fight with a wizard called Raddagoth. He goes first and immediately summons about 6 strong golems (which can cast spells and shoot disabling elemental arrows) and in the same turn goes invisible. I figure I just have to AoE where he went invisible, but no dice (it turns out he also has time to run away to a specific spot on the map in the same turn). The golems deal out mad damage, with the bigger one taking out half my characters’ HP pools a pop, but I barely manage to kill them without a death. Raddagoth reappears and fights us mano e mano. He casts 4 disables a round, but I manage to get him down to 66% before he successfully saves on five of my own disables in a row before summoning another 6 golems and going invisible again. They appear randomly, so the melee golems appear directly in the midst of my squishy ranged characters, and since they act immediately upon appearing, they take out half my party in that one turn. Time to reload.\n\nIn addition to the reasons given above, you will find yourself reloading more often in this game than in some others of its type (like Dragon Age) simply because they made resurrecting party members a chore in which you’re forced to continually hunt for limited and elusive resurrection scrolls. Also, be prepared to often take trips back to town and have your party members take 10-second naps on a random bed to heal up, since there’s no ability to rest on the fly.\nI’ve read that the game is easier after level 10, and indeed the game is feeling easier as my own characters are approaching that level, but that first 8-12 hours or so was pretty excruciating.\n\nI also have a long list of minor yet frustrating gripes. The character progression is boring and the skill book purchase system is boring. The mouse pointer will sometimes miss a moving enemy collision box and make your character move instead of attack, often forcing a game reload due to loss of position. The game forces your spell reticles to snap-to enemy targets, making it difficult to target empty terrain for AoE purposes. It’s sometimes difficult to distinguish when your characters are in contact with an environmental effect, causing your party members to be electrocuted, poisoned, etc. unnecessarily. Your character screams “RARE FIND!” or some other quip no matter how mundane the item is that you’re picking up. The rock-paper-scissors argument resolution game is annoying.  Respecing is an unrealistic option, since it forces you to re-buy all of the expensive skill books that you had (why someone thought this restriction was necessary is beyond me).\n\nFor those who are more interested in the story, there’s nothing to write home about there.The object is to gather the dragonballs to prevent the end of the world and also to prevent the resurrection of the ultimate bad guy. I haven’t completed the game at this point but I’m going to hazard a guess and say that you’re going to attempt to prevent his resurrection but then end up fighting him anyway. I’m impressed by the laziness of the cliché, but I’m even more impressed that they actually combined two big cliches to make it even worse.\n\nThe setting? You’re fighting your way through an unremarkable land plagued by…you guessed it, orcs and undead. Yawn. To top it off, the NPCs, especially the shopkeepers, have the most annoying accents and dialogues ever conceived.\n\nThey way the game throws the plot at the player is abrupt and jarring. For the first fifteen minutes you think you’re investigating an ordinary murder when suddenly one of the dragonballs teleports you to the Arcane Sanctuary from Diablo II. After seeing a space dragon through a giant telescope, you’re told you’re charged with stopping the onset of the end of time. In your journal this quest is labeled “A Source Hunter’s Journey” as if this is just, you know, “all in a day’s work”—hyuk hyuk. The magnitude of the quest could not be any greater, but I just don’t find myself inspired by it.\n\nAgain, I really wanted to like this game after enjoying Divine Divinity (granted, for me it was nothing more significant than a guilty pleasure), but I’m having trouble getting through this game. Unfortunately, I can’t say I recommend it.\n\nTL;DR: Combat is unfair/overly difficult. Combat mechanics and other game features are unpolished. Story sucks.","November 2, 2015","false","45.3"," 31 of 95 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","31","95","2","3"

Besides that buginess Its also overly complicated without a reason. This game reinvented a lot of bicycles and boy they are all clunky! Complexity over simlicity, chaos over order approach. After playing it about 10 hours I cant understand how its skill-ability-attribute system works. I'm getting points but have no idea where to invest them. I cant get used to a cumbersome interface (with controller at least). There is no single item pool to all characters, be ready to spend a lot of hours distributing and comparing stuff between team members. Movement on the battlefield is frustratingly imprecise, you always end up missing clicks and doing wrong actions. You move too slow outside of battle. There is no feel of structure and progression to game, you become instantly overwhelmed with countless things to do and learn after game starts. And this is all on top of very generic uninspired fantasy setting.\nThe one thing I regret about this game -  I played it over 2 hours and cant refund now.","November 6, 2015","false","15.3"," 5 of 40 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","5","40","0","1"

Not only did they not fix most of the glitches, but they spanwed new ones. More than half the time you can't even connect to your friend's game and you get stuck on the loading screen forever. Audio stops working for no reason. I used a remote controller to deactivate a boss's weapons but it didn't work. It's like they put absolutely no effort at all into making the "enhanced" edition. It's in an unplayable state, not even fit to be a pre-pre-alpha.\n\nAll of the old design flaws are still present in this game as well. Everything is voice acted now but it's nothing but zainy cockney accents. The dialouge itself is still poorly written, it reads like D&D fanfiction. The controls are absolutely wonky as well still. For example, and enemy will be almost impossible to click and requires pixel perfect precision to select for an attack. And then the camera moves all around like a spaz after you do something, screwing up your mouse positioning and causing you to give the wrong command. It's pure frustration. Also the animations are still ridiculously slow and combat speed is at a snails pace.\n\nThis game still uses every single cheesey RPG trope imaginable. Such as quests with tedious backtracking, monster spawning portals, idiot townspeople, tons of filler encounters, etc.\n\nI would think with plenty of time to overhaul this game that they would have done an at least passable job at fixing at least a few flaws, but it many ways this is actually a backtrack.

Larian made so many wonderful improvements to the game for the enhanced edition, yet seemingly ignored consistent, severe complaints like sloppy controls and issues with units' idle animations playing during targeting, causing players to misclick and waste their turn.  For a game that prides itself on "tactical, turn-based combat" you'd think that ensuring the controls are tight and responsive and not prone to potentially game-ending errors would be rule number one.\n\nApparently not.  If Larian Studios ever gets off their ♥♥♥ and fixes these complaints that have been around since the first week of the original version, this game will easily be in the A+ category of games and especially with the new "explorer" difficulty, a game I'd heartily recommend to anyone, even people who aren't a big fan of turn-based RPGs.\n\ntl;dr: Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition is the most highly-polished turd I've ever seen.

And didn't like the enhanced version either. I guess turn-based RPG's aren't my type of games. I bought the game back in 2014, and I thought it looked like Diablo or TorchLight, but the view is a troll and the game is not like any kind of hack'n slash game, i.e TorchLight or Diablo. Don't buy if you're an enemy of turnbased attacks, i.e, you attack a few times using Attack Points, AP and after that is done, enemy attacks using their AP, and then it goes back to you, so simply it's a turn-based game and that is not my type of game, and it was really boring these 15 minutes I tried to play without crying. 39,99€ I could have put into eating pizza instead went to a complete failed game to me.\n\nIf you buy it because the images looks like Diablo or TorchLight, just rethink and watch YouTube let's plays etc. Save the buck, don't get tricked!\n\nHowever, I'm not saying the game looks bad.

Because this "enhanced version" of game is designed specifically for consoles, obviously the default camera in this game looks very weird and controller oriented. But the problem is that even when you disable dynamic camera, the problem persists, and camera still acts in the same way. I do not know why other people do not notice that, or is it just a glitch that only my eye spots but the original camera mode of Divinity was way player friendlier in my opinion. For example, in the first dungeon - the camera turns mad at times when your characters stand in front of the wall - you cannot do anything about it at all.\n\nYes, as I explained above, you can still turn it off in the options and observe the map but every time you start a new dialogue, or battle happens, or just randomly, the dynamic camera mode is somehow restored, which is weird in the first place. I may be mistaken, but I do not remember having this issue in the original game at all. I never even thought of that.\n\nI realize that it is not a reason to complain but for me this is an important difference, because I enjoy the new features the game has had so far, including dialogues, rewritten story, lots of new things on the map and I want to exlpore everything, but this new camera makes me to play the game as it is on console but not pc. I do not use controllers to play RPG games, and I want a normal Divinity Camera back.\n\nUpdate:\n\nI tested both original and enhaced games, and camera modes are really different in both. So, those people who tried to prove whether default cameras are the same, please do not confuse people.\n\nP.S.

If you want enough supplies and skillbooks to go out exploring you are advised to rob every building in the town with Scoundrel invisiblity. It feels stupid, they could have put in some defenses aganist this exploit, but since you kinda have to do it to get enough gold its marketed as freedom of gameplay instead of cheesy busy-work.\n- The repetitive NPC phrases is so depressing. How can this not have been fixed? Its been a joke with this game since the start and the fact that you still hear the same phrases EVERY 30 SECONDS is such a troll move by Larian.\n- The spell book is too cluttered IMO, its not the worst crime since most of the spells have a least some use but it feels like such a chore to have spells/consumables/arrows/grenades to all think about. Some form of consolidation would have been better\n- I dont like turn based games that allow you to cast spells before a fight. Its too tempting to exploit and I feel its a problem of game design that shouldnt be put on the player to deciede.\n\nI havent really mentioned the reasons I like this game so much because you will see for yourself why its worth your time pretty quickly.","November 23, 2015","true","56.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deathcricket/recommended/373420/","Deathcricket","Deathcricket","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deathcricket/","168 products in account","this game is amazing! I'm about 200 hours in and still haven't beat it. I keep starting over looking for the perfect way and then I just change my mind and start again. Do I want to 2 brute warriors with healing mages? Do I want to go the standard Warrior, Thief, Archer, Mage combo? Do I want to run a Tank, Healer, Crafter, Mage? Do I want one mage to specialize in Fire and another specialize in curses? So many combos and party configs. The story is also perfect, the voice acting is perfect, the graphics are perfect. Only 3 things bug me.\n\n1. Targeting: Your archer's turn is up, you target this nasty Ogre with a big club who wants to make mince meat of you. You click to shoot your trusty arrow at him and... OMG he swayed back and forth in his standard idle animation, you clicked the ground instead, your wimpy archer walks over to the Ogre and stands next to him. Oh and now your turn is over since you walked all that way, now it's the Ogres turn to smash the ♥♥♥♥ out of your archer with his club.... UGH!!!! It happens to often the targeting system is crap. talking to bunny rabbit or a tiny mouse, it's incredibly hard because you can't click on them. Did you want to move forward and attack the next foe in line? No, apparently your warrior wanted to waste his turn looting the dead skelton during a battle. I mean you clicked on the ground where that dead skeleton was, that must have been what you wanted to do. So during battle to act you have to be very patient and move your mouse to the exact spot, then see how the idle animation works, and time your click for when they are under it. You have to move your mouse ever so slowly to the spot and keep it there for 5 seconds to make sure it actually does what you say it will.\n\n2. Hidden clicks. This kind of ties in with the targeting. But the graphics are perfect and hidden in these are some super hidden clicks that if you don't move your mouse to the exact spot you will miss important aspects of the game. For example: There is a room later on in the game you have to click 5 tiny buttons to get into this middle room and fight 6 demons. I moved my mouse meticulously over the entire terrain looking for these hidden buttons, but the only way I could continue was to look up online where it was and even when it told me I had trouble finding it. Early on the characters say stuff like "I spotted something" but later on there are key places where you just drag your mouse all over the terrain inch by inch looking for secrets. This is not fun.\n\n3. Two players max! You have to hack it to get 4 players working and it doesn't work the best. A 4 player group is pretty key in nearly every other game I've played. So we all played through the story mode 1st, and then went back and hacked our 4 player mode so we wouldn't miss anything and could enjoy the game together. But only being able to play with 1 friend really bummed me out. But if you like single player or just one friend at a time you won't notice this.\n\nOther than that though the game is perfect. The spells vary and work together amazingly. Dop oil on bad guys, light oil on fire, use rain to put fire out, use electricity to shick wet enemies, blast fireball in water to make steam cover for advancing shock troops. It's endless and tons of fun. Even the melee you can charge with different effects like fire, earth,  air, and water. It genuis. The quests have multiple ways to solve, you can he honest, you can steal from them, you can just kill them, you can frame them and watch the story unfold. endless replayability. Also the game is really long! I honestly thought I was at the end of it a couple times and had more than gotten my money's worth. but it keeps going and unfolding constantly. I would guess it takes about 80 hours to complete if you don't use hint guides and refrain from crafting (which is kinda OP) and makes the game a bit easy, even on tactical mode.\n\nHighly recommended 9/10","March 4","true","220.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Besides the story being fantastic, the voices are incredible, the crafting system challenging, the decisions on where to take your character (c;♥♥♥/professions) are so numerous that I had to go back and play it again with a totally different set of classes.  The combat's are challenging as well, but, the second time I went through this (actually, I am currently on my second run), I find the combats much quicker and easier to get through as I have not made the mistakes of taking certain skills to early that I made in the first run.  As you will see if you get this game, there are to many choices and not enough skill points to try them all in a single run.  Plus, i missed so much stuff the first time through that a few extra skill points in perception opened my eyes (literally) to so many hidden traps and mounds to find buried treasure.  Take you time and enjoy this game rather than running through it as fast as you can.  There are gems in this game that are awesome and you can miss if you rush through.

Sorry to be that silent lurker sort, but I figured it was time I contributed to the community.  After all, I do waste way too much time playing games.\n\nIn all honesty; this is one of the best RPGs I have ever played.  And I have played way too many of them.\n\nLeveling actually makes a difference.  The spells are cool and well done.  Voice acting is good throughout the game, which is really rare.  The use of 'the elements', for/against you is a sort of a new idea and well executed and I can't believe nobody else has really done it like this.\n\nThe story is kind of basic but it works well and gets the player involved enough.  I would have preferred some sort of more crazy unexpected twist in the plot.\n\nIt very re-playable, trying different types of characters and (for me) crafting more.\n\nAll in all this game is near perfect.  They have done a very good job.  In my estimation; as good as and in some ways even better than Balder’s Gate, which is difficult for me to admit.","March 15","true","172.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I filed a ticket in Nov. 2015 and have yet to hear anything back from customer support other than "we don't know when someone will have a chance to look at it." Changed to Not Recommended.\n\n====\n\nReally encouraging that in this age of preorders, DLC, season passes, and microtransactions, a studio takes the time to greatly improve their game and releases it for free!\n\nI played ~30 hr in the original version. It was quite good, but did have a few gaps here and there -- for example, crafting was very unintuitive. (Not even asking for hand holding, but I couldn't figure it out even after reading guides.)\n\nEE polishes these rough edges to a shine, and adds in a bunch of new stuff, for example voiceovers of just about everything, and TACTICIAN MODE, which is a higher difficulty level for combat. And it isn't just giving all enemies double health or something cheesy like that; they actually went through and redid the mechanics of all the fights. I'm only about 4 hours into EE, but so far this mode seems fairly challenging, but not over the top. Most fights require some thought, and then tend to leave my party with about 1/4 health. In regular mode, most fights are pretty trivial if you've figured out a few tricks, and I was often able to get past them with >50% health on everyone without really trying. There's also Honor mode, which is Tactician mode + permanent death. I'm not crazy enough for that one, but it's nice to know Larien is keeping the ultra-hardcore players in mind, and is willing to spend time on something only a small percentage of very dedicated players will fully experience.\n\nLooking forward to playing this a lot more and eventually getting the tactician mode achievement!","October 28, 2015","false","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I figured I had always enjoyed the old school turn based RPGs, so why not.  I really like this game!  Very well done and it has a great story that has actually drawn me in!  I normally hate the standard swords and sorcery fair, and the "big" story that arcs through this game is the standard, trite amnesia story, but the minor story arcs that push the "big" story along are immersive!  Combat is fun and has tons of options for a pathway to victory.  Character advancement is wide open too, and hybridization isn't just possible, in my opinion it's mandatory!  Crating is not bad, but I really don't have time to waste experimenting with ingredients.  Crafted gear is on par or better than loot gear!\n\nI am very, very happy I bought this game!","November 27, 2015","true","107.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you don't have a healer, you are screwed, no ifs, ands, or buts about it. To be more specific you need to have a very specific type of healer, either a Hydrosophist or Man-At-Arms, anything else just wont cut it. I wont include any spoilers, but lets just say if you want to play a mage, you will need to take Hydrosophist, and if you want to play a fighter, well, you guessed it. Rogue? Well they're punching bags and probably will be the reason why you carry resurrection scrolls.\n\nThere are certain builds that just outclass everything else, dual wielding wands is an example. A lot of people put one point in dual wield and then the rest in wands, simply because it gives their main hand a bonus, but any more than one point in dual wield doesn't seem to be worth it. Another thing a lot of people do is make one magic character with all the magic schools, why? Because they can have a cacaphony of spells that means they'll always be able to maximize their APs. For me this kind of stuff gets boring fast, but maybe you'll like it.\n\nI don't hate the game, but it's not as good as the hype makes it out to be. It's not Neverwinter Nights 3, it's not even Baldur's Gate 3, though it seems to try to be. In the end, I could've downloaded Baldur's Gate on my tablet and been just as happy. I got it on sale so I wont complain to much.\n\nedit- I fluctuate between liking and hating this game. Even on easy the fights can be annoying and the fact you can't rest makes it so tedious at times. On more than one occassion I've had ot quit because I didn't have the time to wait for my party to heal up, since you have to manually cast spells then wait for the timer on the spell and wash and repeat. It literally took me 10 minutes to heal up my party. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO PLAY, THIS IS NOT THE GAME FOR YOU!!!","January 31","true","62.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The dialog and combat has an old school rpg feel that works for me. The combat reminds me a lot of dragon age: origins but with more of a tabletop (dungeons & dragons, pathfinder etc.) ruleset spliced into it. The dialog and interaction has a similar vibe although I would say this game wants you to explore more and does not hold any hands.\n\nThe pacing of the game is decent although one of the very first quests related to a murder has a very specific way about how you complete it and I did not like that. It's almost as if you have to discover how the game wants you to play. It can be rewarding but honestly it's easy to miss key game mechanics such as trap doors, wall switches etc. so early on in the game when you don't know what you're doing. Once I made it past that though I really started enjoying the core game.\n\nGood combat, vast skill & magic system mixed in with the occassional important decision do make this very enjoyable.","January 6","true","46.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is made and executed the way games like the Baldur's Gate series and the Elder Scrolls series are with an open world, a solid storyline and plenty of side quests to complete along the way.  I'm playing the single-player game in Adventuring mode which is the easiest one.  Some pluses I especially like:\n\n1.  My two main characters affect each other through the choices they make which add or subtract to their abilities and to those of the rest of their team.\n2.  Rift travel.   These are portals that are activated when approached.  Once activated you can step into any portal and travel to any other you've activated.  (There are more features but it would borderline on a spoiler to talk about it.)\n3.  Teleportation:  You acquire 2 teleporter pyramids through a quest.  They are linked to each other.  You drop one somewhere you would like to return to, go on about your business, click on the pyramid in your pack and your team is transported back to the one you dropped.\n4.  Lots and lots, and lots, and lots, and lots of armor, weapons and items to choose from.\n5.  A great crafting/recipe system that allows you to make useful things without the grinding!  You discover the Recipes by placing items in the slots on your Experiment page or acquire a recipe book that teaches it to you when you read the book. (The crafting system includes cooking, blacksmithing, potion-making, tailoring and spell-making and others, all on one character).\n6.  Dynamic and well-thoughtout dialogue.  (example:  My main character had purchased very expensive armor for her fighter.  After he put it on he commented how expensive it was and thanked her for it.)  It's little details like that that let you know how much the developers loved what they were making.\n7.  You are not tied to the skill-set you chose for your character at character creation.  (example: My Wayfarer has her archery skills but now also has the ability to use wands and staves, as well as decent rogue skills.)\n8.  Lots of companions to chose from to complete your 4-person team anyway you like, (single-player).  Some you can "rent", (one-time fee), others you meet along the way and invite them to join.  You can tell a team member to take a hike so you can switch him out for someone else and then put him back on the team when you need him again.  He is sent to a warm and fuzzy "rest area" with the other "Island of Misfit Toys" you've temporarily retired. You can adventure alone or with 2, 3 or 4 companions.\n9. Using tools for crafting, mining, repairing, cooking and others weigh very little and, no matter how big, take up only one block each in your inventory. As well, all other items, armor and weapons take up only one block. A backpack is included in your inventory to give you even more space.\n10.  Inventor:  It's easy to switch between characters.\n11.  For all new players there is a cave/dungeon you are given a choice to enter to before you reach the first town.  It's a very clever and useful way to introduce you to the dynamics of the game and some of the trickier traps you will come across later on. Obvious things like water-beats-fire but it shows you a possible way to do it you may not have thought of, (Like one area where I was instructed to drag a candle over to a pool of oil under some skels to set the oil and the skels on fire). In other words...use your environment, look around you, there are different ways to accomplish the same task.\n\nMinus:\n1.  I can't play this game 24-7...I've tried.  But my husband and my two dogs keep bugging me to be fed and paid attention to.  Isn't that what tv dinners and canned dog food are made for?...geesh!","January 9","true","234.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can see it being very possible to do it quicker, but playing it slowly and enjoying it is definitely worthwhile with this game. There are probably better qualified reviewers still, but at least I would make a baseline qualification as an amateur. That aside, this game incorporates some of the greatest ideas in the genre of top-down, party-based RPGs. Here is a list, some of them sound dry and factual, but also contain experience and opinion:\n\n1. It has a free-roaming co-op mode where you can separate and join as you please\n2. You can write notes on the maps\n3. The log book keeps a good track of the quests, which there are many\n4. It has a competent levelling system where you have to make tough choices about how to level your character\n5. There are five rarities of random loot to keep the rewards fresh for replays.\n6. There is a reason to keep and use scrolls. They get around cooldowns and the spells limited to 1/battle\n7. It has great non-combat encounters which involve diplomatic choices and interesting puzzles.\n8. It balances between high magic an low magic in the setting by having a lot of magic, but few actual spellcasters\n9.

Once you get into it, Divinity: Original Sin EE is an extremely enjoyable game. The story is good, the characters and dialogues are funny and the combat system is highly satisfying. To me, Larian Studios are the new BioWare.\n\nWhat this games possesses that I find other games lack is that I don't feel the need to rush to do this or that to enjoy myself. I don't feel the need to acquire items or gain levels to get to that "Now I'm content" spot. I'm comfortable right where I am, whether it's looting other people's homes, experimenting with the awesome crafting system or just killing random mobs out in the wilderness. There's just that much to do. The game is relaxing in that way.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the old pen & paper CRPG games, this game is cozy to play and has massive replay value.

It is rare that I find games that will allow the creation of a character type that will adjust. For example, say you are playing a ranger, a bow based character with bow based skills. Well, you can add in all sorts of spells from other classes along with it so it suits your parties needs. I made a tanky character, that deals a ♥♥♥♥ ton of damage, AND heals allies.\n\nThe companions in the game you can actually stand, and it actually makes me like them... with the exception of the know it all mage.\n\nFor what little of a map it has, it feels as though you could go on forever "I kept asking myself how much further can I go?!"\n\nYou can complete your objectives in more ways than one, can't find a key to get around a gate? ♥♥♥♥ it. Just teleport one of your main characters over it and the rest of your team shall follow suit.\n\nCrafting.... oooooooooooooh the crafting. It made me so happy. Experimentations gallore. I actually needed a wiki at some points. But not only this, but as your crafting / blacksmithing skills get better, your creations, using the exact same materials gets better.\n\nI can actually use a controller in this, and oddly, it feels nicer to use it, although slightly cluncky it works well. And if you were to so choose to switch between them, save your game and go back to the main menu press a button / key and viola.\n\nMultiplayer too? Larian studios I love you...\n\nThings I  HATED\n\nThe companion AI.... Be wise unlike myself, and don't give your second character an AI. In some quests if they disagree with you they can start an argument. If they win... it can have consequences.....\nFor instance, I gave my second chracter, Scarlett, a Knight AI (personality). When we got to Cyceil we came across two Leigionaires whom had a prediciment. And Scarlett disagreed... things did not work out. (Minor spoilers for this one)  There was a female orc hit with a love potion by one of the leigionaires, you have the option to either kill it or leave it. I said kill it, but Scarlett disagreed and forced an argument, if the other character has High chrasima then they will almost have a guarenteed win. Well needless to say, after we left and came back... they both lay dead, and the orc ran off.\n\nThe voices.... oh god... the voices. I sugggest you either turn down or turn off the voices when you are in town. You will hear the merchancts and the townsfolk repeat the same god damn lines over and over...\nI DONT WANT YOUR DAMN "FRESH" FISH. AND I DONT WANT YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING HOLE FILLED CHEESE. NOW SHUT THE ♥♥♥♥ UP PLEASE.\nFOR THE LOVE OF GOD AND ALL THAT IS HOLY, SHUT UP!!!!\n\n\n\nOverall I love this game to death, I just dont want it to end. I at least want to find people to play with go on more adventures. I have high hopes for this game AND it's sequal coming in December ;)\n\n9.5 outta...

(although yes, they're kind of rare!)\n\nBesides that, it's an excellent RPG regardless of player count.\n\nFor single player, it can be a little awkward starting with 2 custom characters, but that's pretty minor - it kind of tells me it was made for 2 people. You can have 2-4 characters in your party, and 2 or so more in reserve. Your starting 2 can have a "lone wolf" trait which makes them stronger but 1 less person can be in your party. Wish I could double take it and have only one, but I'm weird like that; I once played dragon warrior 3 with a custom character, multiclassed a lot, dragged the main hero around as a ghost, and beat it. That won't be possible here due to all the crowd control going on, which can sometimes be frusterating, but isn't too bad a thing (overcome using summons and defensive stats).","February 9","true","42.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some towns folk can be annoying, and I can't say im the biggest fan of my characters screaming out their abilities like they are from the DBZ universe. But I can overlook this as they tweaked the game in so many other great ways. First and most noteable for me was the optimization they preformed on this version vs. the classic. classic would run for me between 30-60 fps mostly around 45 depending on where i was in the game. The Enchanced edition runs at ultra with 80+ FPS at all times, I havent seen a dip below 60.

Nice!\n- playing with a controller feels as good as with k+m, if not better\n- UI has massively improved, everything is more coherent, really easy to manage with controller\n- performance has improved too: I had to keep settings to medium-highish before, and still game wasn't so fluid.

There's a ton of good things to say about it that I don't know where to start.\n\nOne thing that surprised me about the game is that it's hilarious. One of my favorite parts was reading the tomb stones in the grave yard haha it's great.\n\nI'm new to these types of games where there isn't a quest tracker or anything like that so you need to do the reading and listen carefully to the people and quest logs or else you wont know what to do. Even still i've been somewhat following a walkthrough to help me with the quest as I get lost and don't know what to do.\n\nThat being said I'm sure if you're use to these types of games or have played it before then you probably won't have any issues.\n\nThe story is great and well voice acted. I'm finding myself very interested in the characters and story so that helps me want to come back and play more.\n\nThe combat is fantastic and makes you think of ways of winning as in using different tactics and different advantages to help you win. you are usually outnumbered and the fights are not easy to win. especially if you're new. But that's not to say it's not impossible. it's just a very well balance challenging game.\n\nall in all i recommend this game to anyone who has played these types of games before or if you're intrested and wanna try it please try it. that's what I did and i freaking love this game!

It makes you think tactically, plan out your fighting style, and allows you to customize every aspect of your interactions with others. I have only played the enhanced version where they added voice acting for every single character, and I have to say this is one of the most addicting and underrated games I have ever had the pleasure of playing.\n\nGood:\n- Makes you think tactically, there is room for error, but not enough to get too comfortable\n- Perfectly balanced, it is easy to make a fantastic character, but even with all the right skills and equipment you will rarely just roll over the AI\n- The story is incredibly in-depth and there are numerous sidequests that arent just running around delivering stuff\n- Length.  I have put 67 hours into this game so far and there are still dozens of quests I need to complete\n- Replayability. You have so many options on who you can be and how you can play that any new playthrough will be faster but not any less fun\n- Co-op. With the joint use of two minds, the quests and puzzles are easy to parcel out between two people and you both get the expereience for it, so it moves faster.  It also helps to have both people controlling two characters so you never  forget anything you need for any of your characters\n- Full controller support. I find the controller easier, but the mouse and keyboard is not hard to use\n- This game is absolutely hilarious.  The background banter, conversations, books, and even quests are often funny\n- Works well between linux and PC, I have not run into any compatibility issues or glitches\n\n\nBad:\n- For those who like an easy run-through in games or cheats, this game will not boost your ego.  It can be merciless and you will cry in frustration\n- The descriptions of some of the quests are lacking somewhat, so you really need to read/listen to what people are saying\n- You may receive quests early on that you can't resolve until later in the game, which sometimes gets confusing\n\nOverall:\nThis is a fantastic game that doesn't get enough attention, it is one of the best RPGs ever made.  You could do every quest and still enjoy another playthrough. I was hesitant to buy this game knowing so little about it, but I have never had any reason to regret it.  This is a must-play for any gamer. Every quest you finish is rewarding, but with experience and personal enjoyment.\n\n10/10","March 1","true","106.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pablomakaveli/recommended/373420/","pablomakaveli","pablomakaveli","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pablomakaveli/","813 products in account","TL:DR A CRPG style RPG that has some great turn based tactical combat but its weak story lets it down and leads to a pretty boring lategame. I've marked it not recommended because it wasnt for me but dont take that as me saying its a bad game, but more of a mixed review. Some people will find this to be an enjoyable game but it wasnt for me.\n\nFull Version:\n\nThis game follows two Source Hunters sent to investigate a murder in Cyseal but uncover a more sinister and dangerous plot. Its a top down CRPG but with a really enjoyable turn based combat that incorparates environmental hazards like fire and ice that gives the combat a tactical edge and it's really enjoyable and the games strongest point.\n\nHowever the story is pretty weak and I never felt overly invested in it to the point where even the enjoyable combat wasnt enough to keep my interest. Its a shame really as the first 10-15 hours I really enjoyed the game. The Cyseal section is probably the games strongest section but once I left there the new areas never really gave me as much enjoyment or interest. This game wasnt really enjoyable for me but I wouldnt say its a bad game and some people may enjoy it where i didnt.\n\nGood points:\n- the turn based combat is great and elements play a big part. You can freeze enemies or stun them with electricity or set them on fire. Learning to utilize these effects is important. The environmental hazard like toxic clouds or ice for example can be used to turn the tide of a fight. These elements add a tactical layer to combat where each move has to be carefully considered.\n-the games colourful environments look great particularly the forested and coastal section\n-the inclusion of waypoints that allow fast travel from anywhere provided you're not in combat is a plus as it saves a lot of time from having to back track or run everywhere\n\nBad points:\n-while the story starts well with you investigating a suspicious murder it turns into a dull "heroes saving the world from destruction" plot and makes the later game quite dull. The later quests arent particularly interesting either and the quest log can feel a bit muddled at times.\n-the dialogue is also quite weak and there are few divergent conversations. A lot of it just seemed like dull filler\n-the inventory is a bit hit and miss. When equipping characters equipment can be picked from a pool of items carried by all the characters but this doesnt happen when crafting where the character doing the crafting has to be carrying the necessary items.\n-the "rock,paper,scissiors" minigame you play against the AI to settle arguments or to talk your way past enemies feels too random and annoying. They should have tried for a more enjoyable mechanic that takes better account of your level and skills like Charm.","February 29","false","44.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sorry to be that silent lurker sort, but I figured it was time I contributed to the community.  After all, I do waste way too much time playing games.\n\nIn all honesty; this is one of the best RPGs I have ever played.  And I have played way too many of them.\n\nLeveling actually makes a difference.  The spells are cool and well done.  Voice acting is good throughout the game, which is really rare.  The use of 'the elements', for/against you is a sort of a new idea and well executed and I can't believe nobody else has really done it like this.\n\nThe story is kind of basic but it works well and gets the player involved enough.  I would have preferred some sort of more crazy unexpected twist in the plot.\n\nIt very re-playable, trying different types of characters and (for me) crafting more.\n\nAll in all this game is near perfect.  They have done a very good job.  In my estimation; as good as and in some ways even better than Balder’s Gate, which is difficult for me to admit.","March 15","true","172.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game basically took the best aspects of its predecessor, Divine Divinity, and made them even better. If you like lengthy (100+ hours) RPGs with lots of side quests and things to discover off the beaten path, you'll like this game. If you have an appreciation for games that spare no expense when it comes to graphics, music, effects, etc., you'll love this game. If you get nostalgic thinking about old-school, D&D-style RPGs, this game will be a welcome blast from the past (but with much better graphics and killer music). All in all, I think this game will appeal to true RPG-players, given how much effort the writers invested into the storyline - I found the quests to be very well-written, with an array of moral dilemmas, and your character's choices actually having more than one possible consequence. The turn-based combat requires a bit of strategy, especially if you're playing on a higher difficulty, but for those of you who fear that getting away from the hack-and-slash gameplay will take away from the excitment, I promise you this will not be the case. This game also has its share of humour, so if you want to get the best of its witticisms, do take the time to read the tombstones :)","November 1, 2015","true","106.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is punishing and tough at times, but it is so rewarding when you finally figure things out and kill things. I would recommend anyone this game if you want a challenging and rewarding experience. This is my first time playing Divinity in any shape or form.\n\nBefore I knew it I had 5 hours in on the first day. A game in which I thought I would put in less then 10 hours total.\n\nThis feels a lot like Path of Exile to me. With the turn based focus on fighting.

The game is actually challenging, it harkens back to the old RPGs of yore. You will frequently lose fights and you have to figure out which way to go based on which enemies won't curb stomp you. There's no grinding -- better than that, there's nothing to grind. The environment can be manipulated in many ways to turn a fight in your favor; the direction and tactics of the fights you take give the fights a very dynamic quality.\n\nThe storyline is deep and engaging; it forks in different ways and it feels like your decisions have weight. It doesn't rely on stale fantasy RPG cliches. The environment is well-crafted with a lot of good set pieces and interesting stuff scattered around. The map isn't even that big but a ton of stuff is crammed into it, making use of every space. The only slightly annoying thing is that some of the voice actors are bad and some of the lines get really repetitive (merchants in Cyseal advertising cheese, fish, and greens).\n\n10/10 GOTY","February 19","true","64.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But that was mainly me trying to figure out how to play the game, and creating a multitude of characters to find which one I wanted to play as, now settling on a shadowblade in the Enhanced Edition.\n\n-The journal is still a bit hard to understand coming from a more "linear" background of (insert rpg... Fable? yeah we'll go with Fable) standard questing systems.\n\n-I like the 360 camera, people may not assume it is THAT big of an update to the game but in reality it really opens but parts of the maps and areas you were previously intangible.\n\n-I honestly wish they would have put more time into the actual customization of the characters features, however this isn't too big a deal as the game is more based around class customization and combat to really worry about the actual look of a character, so long as they have a beard... because who can play an rpg without one?\n\n-The new repairing/identifying inventory system honestly should have been in the Original game, it was practically a Sin not to have it, having someone in your party who is particularly skilled with lore should be able to automatically identify things for you, but the standard version did not have this feature.\n\n-Controller Support, now I am a huge fan of keyboard and mouse in games where other plebs use controllers, ie. CSGO, COD, Deus EX: HR... To name a few. But the controller in this game is so great.\n\nAll in all, I did skip over a couple new features however, I will say that whilst playing RDOS - Standard, I did think the game felt a little unfinished and most of the things added should have been in the standard game when it was released, and even though this is literally a "new" game that I got for free, (I got both of them for free really / all the older ones that won't run) the game is still great and if you haven't played it yet, I can only say good things.\n\nEXCEPT!!!!

There is no game out there that comes this to close to providing you an RPG experience as interessting and intricate as D&D, while still being so streamlined.\n\nD:OS rewards the player for thinking out of the box; some situations are better solved stealthily, some using charisma and reason, others might go for the hacky-slashy approach (which can work) or maybe the entire combat phase can be skipped if you picked up the key in a crate behind the bookcase which location you read about in a note on a dead NPC.. The ability to take different routes to complete quests (albeit they sometimes provide a different outcome) is something I haven't sene done before. This isn't your simple choose A), B) or C) kinda story. It goes way beyond that..\n\nCombat being turn-based allows for a lot more strategy than you would expect, saving energy on one turn to do a lot on a second after repositioning might turn the entire battle around. Play to your strengths, try to determine your enemies' weakness (movement, resistances, position..), combo spells with your party for devastating damage/CC...\n\nI tried teleporting barrels of oil around, these apparently break from fall damage and covered my friend and a dozen mobs in oil. Both he and I concluded that, him being surrounded, that my mage could only do one thing to help him.. by setting everything and everyone on fire. So much glorious fire. Like seriousily, you have no idea, how much fire there was. Mobs died, left ooze behind, this caught flame, more explosions, more stuff on fire. My friend died. It was a good day.\n\nAnother great feuture is the fact that D:OS has two main protagonists, and you play as both of these; so if you have a friend who also owns the game, you can complete the story with the two of you, each controlling one protagonist and one companion. (4 total) The fact that your characters have internal discussions and may or may not agree with one another provides another layer of extreme awesomeness. I will NEVER forgive me friend for forcing me to kill a certain character, even though we had a long in-game discussion (read: rock, paper, scissors) to determine said person's faith. But I wouldn't t reload for all the paintings in Cyseal. Stick to your decisions and breathe the wonderful world of Divinity!\n\n10/10 70h played, only halfway through the game, can't get enough of it!\n\nPro-tip:\nIf it looks like you can use it for some kind of crafting, keep it, materials do not respawn. Vendors restock everytime you level up, but this makes things in this game sort of finite. My buddy and I converted an abbandoned building in Cyseal to be our homebase. This place has several "crafting stations" and storage where we drop by every so often.\nAnd don't underestimate the power of non-combat-related stats!\n","April 15","true","82.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
