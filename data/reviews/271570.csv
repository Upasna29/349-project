It is a Co-Op game so invite a friend. As the developers said: you pay for 2 copies of the game. One for you and one for your most trusted ( or troll ) friend.  You are in for a blast. Jetpacks, cookie machines, dinossaurs, bulls, massive grinders trying to mince you into pieces, cows that if "stimulated" will turn their bums into a incinerator... and much much more.\n\nIts been a while since I had so much fun. You can "troll" and be "trolled" not only by your friend...but also by the game. Believe me when I say you that the game can "troll" you on the most particular and awesome ways.\n\nWhat can I say?

We figured since it was a free game, we'd give it a shot.\nGoing in to it, I didn't expect much at all. I didn't think it would be a good or fun game. I thought the look was ugly, the gameplay was gonna be bad, it'd be something I'd play for maybe ten minutes then quit.\nBut then I played a few levels, and I really enjoyed it.\nYeah, the gameplay isn't much. It's simple puzzles with a simplistic design. But that doesn't mean it isn't fun!\nIt's actually pretty cute, I think.\nI've wasted about 3 hours of my time on this game already, without stopping.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ssface/recommended/271570/","ssface","Super Shark Face","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ssface/","284 products in account","This game has some pretty good ideas and some parts of it are fun, but unfortunately the implementation is very poor.  The main thing that makes a lot of it not fun to play is the repetitiveness.  Many of the levels have the same pattern: a super easy part in the beginning of the level (to get you used to the mechanics?) and then a harder part you need trial-\nPositives\nand-error/good RNG to solve.  So then you end up repeating the easy part over and over while trying to figure out the hard part once.\n\nThe repetition wouldn't be so bad if your character wasn't so slow.  It's like your character is walking in molassas.  The default walking speed should be at least twice as fast as it is now, with a toggle key to make your character slower if it's needed for precise movement.\n\nThe other big annoying issue is that the hard levels are hard for the wrong reason.  The puzzles themselves are actually a bit too easy.  What makes some of them hard are unexplained mechanics due to the level order being randomized, the floaty controls, and the fact that enemies can spawn right on you.  That said, most of the levels aren't really that hard, even the ones that are called "Hard".  The one actual difficult level (and again, it's difficult for un-fun reasons) is about 10 times harder than the next hardest level for some reason.\n\nPositive things I can say about it: the graphics and music are charming in an unpolished way, and we didn't have problems connecting to servers (not too much lag either).  The levels that weren't badly designed were actually pretty fun and creative.   But overall, I'd say you should only get this game if it's on sale or free.\n","November 30, 2015","false","4.8"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

Has a total of around 25 co-op maps, a set of 5 different survival co-op challenges and 1 singleplayer survival challenge map. Depending on connection with co-op partner, each level has sufficient variety and tests the movement, puzzle-solving skill and teamwork in you and your co-op partner. Achievements are relatively easy to get with a decent co-op partner. The singleplayer map is also relatively easy to finish and unlock achievement and playable characters.\n\nAmong the cons, there is one very difficult level that is much harder than the rest, and online connection can be troublesome sometimes as the Steam game invite function does not always register in the other person's game.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game only if you have a friend or family member who can play the game online or local co-op with you and only when the game is at discount as it takes less than 10 hours to finish all maps and unlock all possible playable characters and character accessories.","May 31, 2015","true","8.3"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","17","21","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shauntmw/recommended/271570/","shauntmw","~Zero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shauntmw/","1728 products in account","IMPORTANT NOTE: This is a coop-only game. You WILL need a coop buddy to play with. Voice-chat is highly recommended. It is best played via Local-Coop, but Online-Coop is playable too if you can get the network working.\n\nGameplay\nthis is a top-down puzzle game that emphasizes on solving puzzles in coop. It has about 30 different levels, starting from easy levels that introduce game mechanics, to the harder ones that you really need to have some time trying and thinking. You can complete the game in 2-3 hours.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are not hard, and most of them rely on solving in coop. For example, in one of the early stages, player one can see landmines, player two can shoot enemies. Both players have to traverse together to avoid stepping on landmines while shooting the enemies to keep both players safe.\n\nThe graphics and musics are simple and cute, it suits the game pretty well. As a simple indie game, you don't need to have a high-spec rig to play this game. But you might want to tone down the in-game volume so you can use voice-chat.\n\nThe hardest stage is very frustrating though. It is hard in a very frustrating way, and to win that stage you will need to be extremely lucky.\n\nOnline-Coop Network Issues\nI play Online-Coop with my friend, and we encountered quite a lot of connection issues. For one, it has some random lags while playing (even though we are very sure our network is working very fine). Glitches occurs occasionally after the lag is recovered. Since this game is not that popular, there are very few network-issue solutions online.\n\nWe have to keep doing trial-and-error to find an optimal network solution when playing this, sometimes we need to switch host, sometimes it is better when we both use VPN etc. It is very inconsistent.\n\nAnd because of the network issues, we struggled in a lot of harder stages, since some of them rely on coop timing. That is why, playing in Local-Coop is highly recommended.\n\nOne tip for improving the network lag while playing Online-Coop: make sure both players are using the same graphics settings (especially the screen resolution). It helps in my case.\n\nFor Achievement Hunters\nMost of the achievements are easily doable. However the hardest stage is extremely luck-based and very very frustrating to clear, making one of the achievement hard to get.\n\nSome of the achievements cannot be unlocked by the host player, therefore you will need to play in Online-Coop and take turns hosting for both players to unlock those. Not sure if this is a glitch or dev-intended.\n\nMy score: 6/10","April 27","true","7.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

After the first 10 random levels you can pick any route you want, since you can only do 5 levels per route.\n\nThe gameplay consists of you trying to solve with your friend and trust me you will need someone with a mic that you can talk to, cause you will need someone to figure out the puzzles with.\n\nThe puzzles range from trying to get to the end of the level by activating switches, killing robots with different weapons and gadgets. They very from shotguns to pistols, to explosives, you also have gadgets like jetpacks, x ray glasses and torches.\n\nThe game is incredibly fun with a friend, but there is also a lot of bad.\n\nThe controls are for the most part really fluid, but there are some bits that are incredibly annoying to control ( you will know once you see it).\n\nFirst of all the soundtrack is atrocious. It really hurts the ears while you're playing, overall the audio design is really mediocre, not to mention when talking on skype or through any other software it's gonna be incredibly hard to hear what your friend has to say, cause even then the sound is way too loud.\n\nThe game also has some level design issues. Like some really hard stuff. Now hard stuff isn't bad, but some of the stuff in the game is incredibly unfair.\n\nThe game took me 4 hours to finish. There is some replay value to do the extra achievements and there's also a challenge room to test your skills.\n\nOverall do I recommend Space Farmers ? For the full price no, but once it goes on sale definitely give it a try and give the second copy to your friend and have yourself a good ol time.\n\nPros:\n+Great puzzles\n+Fun Gameplay\n+Good Co Op\n\nCons:\n-Terrible music\n-Clunky controls\n\n\nFinal Rating:\n7/10\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!\n","May 16","true","4.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Some are innovative like a stick together band, bullfighting or feeding Dinosaurs with pancakes. And all happens in space.\nYou  can explore many sectors of your spaceship with given difficulties.

But don buy this game if you dont have any friends, this game is all up for teamwork and i think its only enjoy able with a friend. The game overall is okay, it gets very, very repetive when you have to go on to same levels all over and over just to unlock more parts of the ship (more levels).

When you select to play co-op you have a list where you must find your friends name, from there you can invite them into the game but this list is almost always incomplete.\n\n2nd issue with this game is its lag. It is so out of sync it’s unplayable. You have no idea where your partner is on the map and when you do happen to see them they re-appear elsewhere.\n\nIf this game is a co-op game why not fix these issues before you launch a game..?\nWhen I originally purchased this game I gave it a positive review because when it happens to work it is a fun cute and funny game.\n\nIts flaws were not that bad but playable after you got through the first hassle I mentioned. It was 50/50 now I am updating this review because it’s now an issue of up to 70/100 so therefore I no longer support or recommend this game.\n\nNo longer support this game not even in my curator page. I will ONLY update this review if these issues are fixed. Sadly this WAS one of my favorite games and am only sad to see little to no support for the game.","August 20, 2014","false","24.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","4"

Essentially, it's a coop only puzzle (maybe?) game, designed to be played in short 5 level runs through self contained rooms that each focus on a particular theme or item. At times that's as easy as running from point A-B, other times you'll need to direct a robotic bull by using a rather distracting hat, or move pigs onto buttons to keep doors from closing.\n\nI rather like the idea of semi random, varied objectives and play styles something along the lines of WarioWare, with a short playtime requirement and some goofy customization options, but Space Farmers just comes across as so incredibly lazy in its design. It's constantly punishing for the slightest mistakes, never explains anything about itself (instead asking you to navigate outside of the game to a webpage to read a how-to), and forces you to replay the same tired levels over and over again do to there being no way to select which you want to play or even simply limit them to ones you haven't already gone through. The presentation is unremarkable and unpolished, with an unhelpful UI, and mediocre controller support, not to mention a general instability that saw the game crashing numerous times in just the hour or so I spent playing.\n\nIt's a tediously dull game all around, in ways that seem like so easily avoidable and amendable, but despite its frequent content updates its issues are so ingrained at this point that I'm not sure they could be fixed in a simple patch, leaving me pessimistic it will ever turn into something worthwhile.","October 8, 2014","false","1.1"," 29 of 52 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","29","52","0","3"

There are pigs and cows lurking around, and farmer characters to select, but you will not be collecting the harvest. Put away your thoughts of hovering tractors flying through fields of off-color fruits and vegetables. Instead of the zero gravity crop simulator you might expect from Steam in 2014, Space Farmers is instead a co-op puzzle game put out by the BumpkinBrothers. It’s a game that’s full of clever hooks and the kind of great moments you can only get when playing with a friend, but it’s held back by a bizarre progression that forces you to solve the same puzzles over and over again. Combine that with a nonexistent online community, and Space Farmers becomes something to pull out at parties or with a buddy, a fleeting fancy rather than a must have experience.\n\nWant to read more?

It's a kind of Unity game you can make in a week or two with about as much content and testing as that implies. My Xbox 360 controllers pull to the left randomly--often killing you--and there's no ability to adjust the game's joystick dead zones. The levels are very empty and non-interactive, and the puzzles get very hard very quickly. I'm used to old 80's/90's games where a twitch can kill you, but my wife isn't. So any time she dies, the round starts over at the beginning with no checkpoints.\n\nThe puzzles just aren't fun enough to warrant dying 20, 30 times just to move forward. At least in better games where death is also common, the death is quick and gets you right back into the action. This one makes you walk... and walk... and walk... to the third part of a puzzle doing the same boring steps that you've already learned. "Shoot guy, walk at a snails pace to pick up block, place on switch... controller moved me into a stray bullet and now I'm dead. Start over." repeat 30 times.\n\nI'd definitely watch a Let's Play video from the very start to make sure this isn't going to bore or frustrate you before plucking down the $10 that I did.","April 20, 2015","false","0.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This gets very annoying when you want to play a Co-op game with a friend but you can't because it won't connect. The singleplayer is pretty good, a Survival-type minigame where you have to try and fend off the Vege-monsters, robots and other strange but funny creatures. I quite like the way you can collect Ammo from the Wooden Crates, but also get a random new gun. Overall the Singleplayer Minigames are pretty fun. After having trouble trying to connect with multiple friends on Steam, and it still not working.\n\n\n\nOverall I think this game deserves a 6.5/10.","May 27, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes, expecially if you're planning on letting kids play this, since none of the puzzles are too hard, are short enough to finish fast and are quite fun.\nI would however suggest buying it on a sale as I feel that 9,99€ for it is a bit too much.","May 15","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The first level took us around 15 tries, but by the end we knew how the level worked and had no trouble getting through it.\n[Turnips]  I adore this in-game currency, firstly because it is not gained through micro transactions, you have to work to get them. Secondly, the way you use it, picture the scene, you are low on health, and have just reached a tough part in the level where you KNOW you are going to get hit, ta-da!  There is a health-dispenser that costs 10 turnips per 10% of your health restored, genius.  And not only can it be used for this, but the game has a decent variety of customization for the user, after a run of the game, you can go back and edit your player, some items are already unlocked for you, but with turnips, you can unlock some lovely clothing and character player models.  My favourite custom item being the fez.\n[Co-op]  This is the most co-op based co-op game on the market as of right now,  well, that and portal 2, but for now we'll focus on the game shall we?  There are genius puzzles of the game for players to bang their heads on the desk at, not because it isn't fun, because it's difficult to get used too. No 2 puzzles in the game are similar, each level introduces a new way of solving it, one of my favourites is the invisible path level. You literally have to direct your partner through what to them looks like nothing but air.\n\nOk, we've done good things, but there were a few bit's and pieces of the game I wasn't so sure about:\n\n[Menu]  This game has some absolutely fantastic elements in it, and I love it to bits, BUT the menu, the thing you see when you load the game up, could look... better...  compared to the rest of the game, it kind of let it down.\n[Choosing levels]  When we had finished the first 5 or so levels, the game took us to a little hall, with a funny looking band playing music, and I was dumb enough to tell my friend to step on the pressure plate nearest to the entrance.  It started the game again...  And also seemed to shuffle in levels we hadn't played yet, at this point we decided to stop playing for the day, very confused.\n\n\nThat's all I really have to say about this fantastic Indie game.  Thanks for adding some awesome new things, and apologies for not finding everything so up to scratch.\n\n","September 2, 2014","true","3.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But don't buy this game if you don't have any friends, this game is all up for teamwork and i think it's only enjoyable with a friend. The game overall is okay, it gets very, very repetitive when you have to go on to same levels all over and over just to unlock more parts of the ship (more levels). The graphics is like Roblox haha, not better than that.

It is insanely difficult, restarting the level at a single mistake, has lots of puzzles that aren't for those trash talking 7-year olds in call of duty and you have to have atleast one friend to play with, which just means sending them an extra copy as this is a 2-pack. There is only one solo mode which is lackluster in comparison to the randomly selected level system which I will get to later.\n\nGAMEPLAY: the gameplay in space farmers requires you, and a friend, to get through a set of 5 levels chosen from random from around 15-20 seperate missions. these include running from a giant meat-squishy thingy to dropping pies from a machine on your back to guide the "pie-o-saurus" through some laser fields. you do this with weapon such as a high-tech energy shotgun to a basic pitchfork, aswell as gadgets like a hover-pack similar to in ratchet and clank and a backpack that potatos that can only be used with the other players detonator.\n\nCHARACTERS: you collect turnips to buy new characters such as markiplier and a ninja and hats like a fez or a pirate hat. this can make some crazy combinations of playable characters and seeing what y friend gets next, is very, very satisfying and hilarious (last time he was a creepy-girl with a giraffe mask) this character was fighting alongside me (markiplier with a fez).\n\nREPLAYABILITY: there is alot of replay value with the randomly chosen levels, but the constant replaying of RUN! which is always first, I think. but after you have done ten different levels overall you can choose, which is a nice feature.\n\nGRAPHICS: the graphics in space farmers are very cartoony and really fits with the feel of the game. they may not be to everyne's tastes but honestly, what is nowadays?\n\nOVERALL: space farmers is a blast to play with a friend and the wide variety of missions almost always mean something new.\n\nI give space farmers 8.9/10","January 25, 2015","true","14.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, "If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately." Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- "Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.","June 20, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Once you've beaten it once, there's really no difficulty in beating it again, most just have one mediocre puzzle, some having no puzzle at all and just requiring you to run.\n\nAt the price point of you and your friend needing to spend $10 (previously said $20, but you get a double pack) to play this game (There is no single player), it is absolutely not worth it by ANY stretch of the imagination.\n\nThe issue with the level design is there is no varience, it is using the two items given to you at the start to solve the singular gimic. It's like getting a power up in other games, such as in Metroid Prime when you get the power shot upgrade, you already immediately know that the next solution is to use the power shot to solve it. Fortunately, in a game like that, the length allows more opportunites to use what you have in combination or solve puzzles or beat bosses, but in a game with this design, where the levels are 5 to 6 minutes long, there is no puzzle on a lot of levels, it's use the new introduced item to clear the level. The level with the potato bomb or whatever launcher and the gloves that let you pick up bigger things are clear examples, I didn't bother playing the other 10 or so that are randomly given to you until you beat so many levels or whatever the stipulation is to choose your own levels, freeing you from the chains of random selection that can force you to play through the same simplistic levels. I wouldn't recommend this game if it had 100 levels in the same style.\n\nI'd highly suggest anyone looking to pick up a co-op game to explore other titles such as Hammerwatch or Risk of Rain at similar price points.\n\nIt's a ♥♥♥♥ poor game that promises more, but has no reason to give anymore. I don't recommend this at all.","October 10, 2014","false","0.9"," 28 of 58 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","28","58","0","2"

Long missions that are unenjoyable and easy are just not the kind of puzzle solving you want to be doing. Shop lacks items and are extremely cheap so it is easy to obtain high end shop items.

How a regular person can even play, let alone enjoy this waste of time is beyond me.\n\nFirst of all, if you were looking for space farmers, you're in the wrong place. This game has little to do with space or farming whatsoever. It's about some "farmer"-looking Minecraft Steve lookalikes traversing through some isometric-view action platforming.\n\nSure, it was 90 cents in money wasted, but to get this POS even working for local co-op took half an hour of wrangling; not with the two Win 7 PCs on the same network to talk to each other, but through this game.\n\nAudio issues (i.e. no audio at all) were apparent on one PC; WASD controls were not registered on one PC; with regards to the networking issues, after finally connecting successfully, a change in server from the host PC required a complete restart of the game from the other PC to even recognise a game; otherwise it just sat there saying "connected" and not doing anything on either computer. Another would not even load the splash visual custimisation screen and the only way to play was to hover over the taskbar icon and double tap Enter, which loaded the game in windowed minimal resolution mode. Without sound.\n\nAlso, the gameplay really sucked. The 90 cents are gone, but the frustration of me and my friends stays with me.\n\n2/10, it's not even worth 90 cents on Steam and writing this review was a catharsis.\n\n","May 19, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are some clever elements in it. Biggest issue is the lack of controller support. Its only really deep into the game that you get to sit on the couch. For the rest of the time, you have to use the mouse. Other than that, having to go right back to the start of the level is frustrating as you only have to get hit once or twice to die, but I guess this is similar to many other co-op style games.","March 22","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mostly because it was slowly moving away from me into the mouths of chomping robots on the electrical floor in the dark while my torch just died\n\nHonestly though, my boyfriend and I raged a lot. A whole lot.\nBut, in my opinion, it's a really fun game. It has cool ideas for levels although they definitely take a while to do and get right.
