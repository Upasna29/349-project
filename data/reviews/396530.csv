I was sort of charmed by the whole thing! Then came the first jump scare - as cheap and context-free as an old Youtube "maze" prank. I started to lose patience with the many cut-and-paste cabins scattered around, and the lack of a map. I read a bunch of journals, pulled a couple levers, and then - after an hour-and-a-half - I was lost, with no indication of whether I was 2 minutes from a solution or 2 hours. The game told me I couldn't quit (in words that had always suggested I might eventually), so I had to shut it down and pray for an autosave. But, when I booted up again, I was back at the start and p&%$d.\n\nI hate to trash a promising labor of love by a small development team, but the game didn't bore me, it aggravated me. I hope the team saves the day with a save feature, and maybe a map. Until then, I would advise against spending money on it.","September 8, 2015","false","2.3"," 40 of 45 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","40","45","3","3"

This game has been panned pretty hard, but it did look cool enough for me to have it on my wishlist for a while. Thankfully, it came up in a recent bundle, making it the perfect opportunity to try it out. My experience was a bit of a mixed bag.\n\nVisually, it was pretty standard Unity engine fare, meaning it looked cool, but certainly not ground breaking at all. I have found personally that this style of graphics and sound does work quite well for the more dramatic and conceptual horror titles, so definitely not a bad thing, and I thought the devs actually utilized it well.\n\nHowever, another standard of the Unity game are rampant bugginess as it pertains to screen tearing, lag, and clipping, all of which are present in this game. Not to a game breaking extent, but it definitely got annoying at times. Also, another thing I have noted with a lot of these games is difficulty with hit detection, like when you are trying to pick up an item 40 or 50 times before it actually recognizes that you really do in fact have the cursor over the item you are trying to pick up. All of those things do serve to break immersion in the game.\n\nAs far as the story itself, it is basically as stated in the store page. The story is revealed via notes you find and the occasional on screen message (although those really serve more as hints). It's interesting enough and although sparse, does convey what it intends to quite well.\n\nSpeaking of the notes, you definitely need to find all of them before you can move on (from my own game experience anyway). That will take a bit of wandering. They are in the buildings, so dont waste your time looking around the forest floor.\n\nThere are a few puzzles in the game, and none were too complex. However, I did run across an issue with what I assume is the last puzzle in what amounts to the third chapter that brings home an actual game breaking issue. No saves, and in fact, no game menu whatsoever. For this game, it would have been ideal to include at the very least, auto saves before critical moments so that, if you mess up, you can go back and try again, because....at least in my play through, messing up a particular puzzle resulted in not being able to progress any further, and unfortunately, once you leave the game, you also have to start over from the very beginning of the game, which isnt cool at all, and in fact, did mark the end of my playthrough.\n\nThat is unfortunate, because this game actually is pretty cool despite all its flaws, but given those flaws, combined with no saves, I find it difficult to recommend this game. I rate it as a 3 out of 10, and that rating would increase to a 6 out of 10 if it had saves, for perspective.","October 31, 2015","false","2.3"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","23","23","0","1"

In some moments I was really annoyed by the fact that there is no main menu or pause menu but also, I kinda got over it.\nThe idea of this game is good, I like the story quite a lot, but there are many things that should be fixed as trees penetrating through some object(branches), and dumb AI for example.\nMy conclusion is that for a small price this is a solid game, you can actually feel the breeze while playing which I like.\n7/10 for indie game!!","October 9, 2015","true","0.1"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","21","3","14","0","0"

I've just played the game and I found several issues. Most of the flaws were regarding the design itself, it was a bit sloppy and I've noticed you were using free assets which did not make me feel that happy about the game. Also there were some logical mistakes some of which are probably left there intentionally for players to find... I think it would be great if you added the save option because I had some stuff to do and had to start the game all over. The story itself did its job by keeping me interested for the jumpscares to take place. I do in the other hand support your work and want you to stay motivated so we could expect even more and even better games in the future...","September 10, 2015","true","0.9"," 5 of 19 people (26%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","26","5","19","0","0"

Above average when it comes to horror mostly because it does not have much story connection between the scenes, except the letters, but the dark scenery, music and let`s not forget the scares, are very nicely done. 7/10\n- Art. Beautiful graphic in the scenes and detailed structure. It`s very obvious that the team that created this game watches a lot of horror movies, plays a lot of horror games and has studied all the aspects of horror making games, but it still needs more imagination. 9/10\n- Music 10/10\n- Puzzles and characters. The puzzles are hard to understand sometimes which in fact makes it a good puzzle, so no point criticizing the puzzles to much, except to have a bit more character interaction to do a puzzle would benefit the game even more and having a few more puzzles would not hurt anyone. The characters like the zombie and the ghost are how can i say to plain, which in fact i can conclude that you don`t have your own model creator. So if you plan on making a next game, which i think you do, you will need one or two who can do that part of work. So puzzles 9/10, characters 6/10.\n\nIn conclusion the score of the game, from the above listed facts, would be 8/10, but considering that this is your first experience in game developing and the first time you publicly announced a game i have to say that it is really good made and no one can make something perfect in his/her first time trying or without practise. So in future developing i wish you success.\n\nBest regards,\nTx.","September 8, 2015","true","6.0"," 7 of 46 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","7","46","0","2"

Sometimes, it does lag in small amount when it comes to rendering big terrain but it disappears quickly. To be short, this game is as good as it can be for indie developers, and also, I had a nice time playing it.\nP.S more puzzles next time :)","September 7, 2015","true","1.6"," 6 of 62 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","6","62","0","6"

It has the player experience a story. There is no ingame options menu, I guess the developer did that to make the player feel more alive, that might be offputting to some. I've had a few frame drops here and there but the overall experience was nice. It got me interested in a few things. In my opinion, a great indie game.\n\nPS : The developer is a friend of mine, I tried to be as objective as possible.","September 7, 2015","true","1.8"," 17 of 95 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","17","95","0","5"

It looks nice enough. The sounds were okay. It just doesn't WORK! When I have to restart the game about 4 times just to be able to FINALLY pick up the book for the first puzzle, there is a problem. And watching the sword glitch through the floor is only funny the first time. It loses it's charm when you can't progress unless you take tiny steps up the stairs just to make sure the object stays with you and isn't lost into the depth of gaming hell.\n\nLet's not forget that the story is also sub-par (when you can actually find the notes and figure out what's going on) and the scares are pathetic at best. Then again, maybe the story would have gotten better and I missed it. I ended up quitting just after I found what I think was a cemetary by the cabins, but I couldn't take how broken it was to stick to it and find out.\n\nDevelopers, keep trying but make sure it works first.","March 22","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
