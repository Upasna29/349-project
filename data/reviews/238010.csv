Be warned that if you're at a personal point of no return then you may wish to hold off on getting this version.\n\nAn amazing redux of the original title it does have its flaws. The first of which being that the implimentation of integrating the DLC mission was rather poorly handled and its entirely possible to accidentally leave your guns and even Praxis (the upgrades to augmentations) points behind without meaning to as I had nearly done this had I not gone actively looking for them. For those curious, they're to the left at the end of the mission before getting onto the boat but positioned as such that it can completely escape the eye when crossing by it.\n\nThere is also NO balancing for New Game Plus. You don't get to carry over your weapons (why?) but your augmentations carry over, which is an odd choice since by the end of the game even a casual player can almost peak out the character and almost break the game when launching into a new game, which wouldn't have been the same had inventory carried over as weapons and items don't have quite the same effect on gameplay that some of the augmentations do leading to some awkward moments where you've long since passed an area and the dialog is minutes behind on registering because you're flying through levels faster than anticipated.\n\nThe graphics did get a neat little boost, but having come from playing the original version straight to the new one, its hard to really tell unless you know exactly what you're looking for. Lighting effects are perhaps the most noteable and easiest to miss unless you're familiar with specific areas of the game that would have otherwise been completely overlooked.\n\nBoss fights are perhaps the most  changed out of everything since there are now alternate ways to take out a boss rather than resorting to using up your ammo or praying you outdamage them. They're still rather frustrating however as their AI hasn't really been modified to accept these changes in level design leading to a rather awkward moment where the Boss paces in just a small area attempting to find you in a room they are completely unfamiliar with, or have to rely solely on bull rushing to get to you before you're able to hack a panel.\n\nOverall though the game still stands up, but if you're looking for an amazing Cyber Punk experience and don't mind some dated graphics, seek out the original Deus Ex as it has the most in terms of balance, but for the modern era of gaming there really isn't an experience like Human Revolution.","November 25, 2013","true","53.0"," 967 of 1,051 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","967","1","0","34"

And now that I've finished it, I must say that I consider this is easily one of my most favorite games of all time.\n\nIs it perfect?  Of course not.  But what this game *does* have is, interesting settings, compelling and very possible vision of a world in the near future, fascinating storyline and memorable characters....and all of that will stay with you long after the game's done.  There are multiple ways of going through each area to suit just about any playstyle out there; nooks and crannies to explore, secret areas to discover, emails to read, people to talk to, and sidequests to complete.  The game does not lock you into a specific playstyle, but rather makes it possible, through giving the player the ability to pick and choose their augmentations, to cater to and enhance, various ways of play.  Like to sneak around, hack into things and be virtually undetectable?  You can do that.  Like to just mow everyone down with explosions and heavy weapons?  You can do that too.  Don't like killing anyone?  Yes, you can be a pacifist and just knock people out.\n\nOne of the most interesting themes the game offers is the subject of the progress of technology and how it relates to us as humans.  Refreshingly, the game doesn't have a pre-determinted opinion on this and doesn't clobber you over the head with whatever it thinks is the right answer.  Rather, throughout the game, it allows you various glimpses and insights into different views from people you interact with, which affect your perception of the matter at hand, and, ultimately, play a huge role in how it all plays out in the end.\n\nTL;DR - highly recommended, buy it and play it if you haven't already! :D\n\n","November 27, 2013","true","44.7"," 261 of 299 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","261","299","0","16"

Said lore is expansive and actually very interesting to read. So is all the dialog, with very well done voice acting especially by the protagonist. The sounds are great too, including the weapons.\n\nThe game is first person and seamlessly moves to third person whenever you hug a wall or climb a ladder. You can use a variety of weapons from pistols to shotguns, rifles and crossbows, even rocket launchers. There are non-lethal weapons too like tazers and a tranq rifle. You have an inventory you have to manage which holds your weapons, ammo, and everything else you might want. There are plenty of lootable objects, including your enemies.\n\nThe game works like this: you are given a goal and are free to get to it how you wish. And I mean really free. Not like some other games which try to make you believe their attempt at stealth actually counts, because in the end you just kill the guys anyway. No, here you actually do have a choice. It is quite possible to avoid contact with any enemy in the game (except bosses), and doing so actually earns you more rewards than if you killed everybody. And if you're real good you can silently take everyone out and earn the ghost rewards. You do this by utilizing alternate routes, many of which can only be accessed if you take non-combat perks. You can also talk your way through certain areas, or hack certain things so you can slip by. This is far from a linear game.\n\nPerks you can get include higher jumping, more strength (to pick up that vending machine revealing the vent behind it, or use it to access a high ledge, or even as a shield from gunfire or to throw at your enemies for lots of damage), poison resistant lungs (to move through contaminated areas), hacking, stealth perks, and more. And of course there are perks to aid in combat like less recoil, damage resistance, ability to see through walls and mark targets too.\n\nYes there most definitely is replayability. You are given choices throughout the game which does have a minor impact on what happens along that avenue, including what some people will say to you. If you choose to go in guns blazing your first time, you should probably try it a second time as a stealth person; you will learn things about the game you never would otherwise. There is also a new game plus so you can keep your perks from last game and eventually have everything unlocked during your second, if you so wish. Some people don't like achievements, but if this game didn't have one for beating it without killing anyone and another for never setting off an alarm, I most likely never would have bothered and therefore would have missed out on some fun and challenge.\n\nClosing remark I would like to say that this game is a very worthy successor to the original masterpiece of Deus Ex. If you enjoyed that classic then you are all but guaranteed to enjoy this too.\n\nIf you want a very in depth game filled with many hours of memorable gameplay, then do yourself a favor and buy this. At 20 bucks it's a great deal, on sale you have no excuse to pass it up. Buy now!","May 16, 2014","true","51.1"," 259 of 298 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","259","298","0","9"

The game's story in addition to the way you choose to proceed through it and the gaming style you choose to follow complement one another deftly to provide you with an exceptional experience.\n\nThe good things\n* Story: It mainly revolves around the ethics of "augmentations", that is cyberntic extensions that can be attached to a human being to improve the body or/and the mind. You are Adam Jensen, one who was recently cybernetically augmented. Yes, you are the the main character but you'll quickly see that you are part of a very big story with multiple secondary characters having their own agendas. The ending is satisfactory as there is no loose plot, and everything falls nicely into one place.\n* Level design: There are many ways for you to complete an objective. There generally is the main way (rambo), and many other paths. There is always a secondary path that will allow anyone to get inside a building without requiring special augmentations, while other may require you to level up a cybernetic part of your body. Being curious is a good thing. Also, being a "hacker" is great: it's a bit difficult to invest on this from the start but it pays off quickly as you are able to get to places you couldn't reach easily otherwise.\n* Stealth: You can finish the game without killing anyone, except the bosses. I wish more games do that.\n\nThe less good things\n* Boss battles: it's certainly the weakest point of the game. Yes, you can use the environment rather than weapons to kill them, but all boss battles (except the last one maybe) left me underwhelmed.\n* Difficulty: If you go the "hacker" way, you'll find that the game gets much easier. I had only one playthrough (too many games to play to do it a second time) so maybe it's true only for the hacking part.\n\nIt's also supposed to be an action game, as you can play it "rambo" style... But you would miss a lot by doing that. I suggest anyone wanting to get the best from this game to play it in stealth mode: also, try to avoid killing anyone (Pacifist achievement) and avoid starting off alarms. And, play in on max difficulty. This combination should arguably be the best way to play the game.","May 18, 2015","true","20.1"," 147 of 157 people (94%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","94","147","157","9","3"

After youve found  a considerable safe spot, weep for a few seconds while panicking over the millions of possible ways you might die as you regenerate\n\n6.

Respawn and stay in your previous safe spot and wait for them to come get the b8\n\n10. When they fall for the b8 gun them down or use a takedown, repeat steps 1 - 10 (hopefully avoiding step number 8 if you already got the hang of it)\n\n11. Keep repeating steps 1 - 10 until you meet up with a boss\n\n12. Panic and run the ♥♥♥♥ for your life because you have just entered a boss fight without knowing there was going to be a boss fight and you were probably not even prepared for this and you probably didnt ask for this\n\n13. Realize that theres about 100 powerful weapons (or 1,000 regular weapons) with enough ammo conveniently placed there because even if you didt prepare for the boss fight the game lets you prepare for the boss fight in the middle of the boss fight\n\n14. Kill the boss and realize that all your panic and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t for this boss fight was unnecessary since the boss fights here are honestly so easy they feel like overly dramatic tutorials on how to run for your life and shoot while doing such\n\n15.

Get your augs and weapons back, and get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off over the fact that you dont get all your praxis points back for all your augs\n\n22. Continue with The Missing Link *insert spoilers here*\n\n23.

Watch the "surprise ending" at the end of the credits and yell out "I WANT A SEQUEL, I NEED A SEQUEL, IF THERES NO SEQUEL I WILL DIE" for about an hour or so and get mind♥♥♥♥ed over how this just might connect with the original Deus Ex, just about as mind♥♥♥♥ed as one can get with Bioshock Infinites ending and its relations with the original Bioshock, but thats a whole 'nother story or as mind♥♥♥♥ing as on how the worlds of Portal and Half-Life are supposedly the same.\n\n28.

These increasingly high stakes result in a growing focus on corporate espionage and security – enter Adam Jensen – an ex-SWAT Commander hired as head of security for Sarif Industries. The opening credits detail Jensen’s brutal execution-style killing during a break-in at Sarif Industries, his resurrection through cryogenic augmentation and drops you into the shoes of the Part-Man, Part-Machine, to piece together the fragmented memories of the past and uncover the cause of the attack. An engrossing, deep campaign takes you around the world, on sprawling open world levels where the broader storyline is broken up through the distractions of a richly atmospheric world, numerous side quests, and lots of collectibles and readable background lore scattered around the maps.\n\nGameplay | Graphics | Sound: Gameplay is aligned around the game’s 4 pillars of FPS based-combat, Stealth mechanics, RPG elements (of character customization) and Player Choice in story-telling direction – and the game seamlessly switches from one mode to another. You are allowed considerable breadth of choice in approaching every situation – Frontal Assault, Stealth or even Smooth-Talking your way past the opposition - building in replayability into the title as well. Several different situational outcomes, great graphics with a trademark orange machine-hue, a brooding pulsating score, responsive K&M controls and controller support round out a well polished title.  Note that this review is based on the ‘Director’s Cut’ version of the game which includes all DLC integrated directly into the overall campaign – resulting in close to 75-80 hours of gameplay to complete the campaign, track down all side-quests, see through multiple endings, read all the lore etc (but your mileage may vary).\n\nFlaws: Minor quibbles with the game include the occasional scripted boss battle that while serving to move the broader narrative along, tend to stifle the freedom otherwise celebrated throughout the game. Other issues include longish load times, an inordinate disk space requirement (of 20+ Gigs) and being particularly resource heavy, resulting in some framerate drop issues.\n\nOverall however, ‘Deus-Ex: Human Revolution’ is a triumphant blend of story-telling and disparate game genres. A visually stunning and immersive world, a deep, layered campaign, large open world levels, multiple endings determined by player choice, and very good replayability make this one of the best story-driven titles of recent memory. While the game’s broadly Sci-Fi / Cyber-punk theme will admittedly not be to everyone’s taste, for fans of the genre and classic sci-fi flicks such as RoboCop and BladeRunner, this is essential gaming and overall, a shining example of Gaming Evolved.

As far as multiplatform games go, this is probably the best you can get to recreate the old Deus Ex atmosphere.\n\nLong version: Deus Ex: Human Revolution is the third instalment in the Deus Ex series, and it’s also the prequel and the spiritual successor of the highly acclaimed first game from 2000– mostly disregarding the existence of the not-so-popular second game.\n\nDeus Ex always liked to promote freedom in play styles. All missions, be it plot-critical or just a side quest, have at least two solutions: go in guns blazing, or be sneaky. Although there is a decent arsenal in the game, and a few lethal augmentations (this franchise’s version of spells), the designers clearly favour the latter: there are hidden routes everywhere, you can bypass security systems, and there are several ways to dispose of the guards in a non-lethal, silent manner. You even get a large praxis (experience) boost when choosing these solutions.\n\nThe story involves yet another conspiracy, but without any clandestine organisations secretly trying to topple the current society. The scale is smaller: you deal with corporate espionage and political movements resenting the human augmentation technology. You will still encounter soldiers working for the secret government, but the most common enemies are thugs and private security.\n\nThe Director’s Cut, the only version available now, integrates the formerly separate expansion into the storyline, which unbalances the endgame, but creates a more coherent narrative. The boss fights, the bane of the original edition, also got revamped, but they are only slightly better now. Still, all and all, this is the superior version (despite some technical issues), the one recommended for all cRPG fans, be them new or old.","October 27, 2015","true","100.1"," 101 of 108 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","101","108","5","0"

Unfortunately, small annoying bugs and game breaking exploits brings a lot of frustration to the player. The main question to ask is: Should the owner of the original Deus Ex: HR and TML get the Director's Cut? What about new players who want to play it? The answer shall be reveal.\n\nFor newcomers, Deus Ex: Human Revolution takes place in the year, 2027, in a cyberpunk universe where the debate about human augmentation vs human nature gone horribly out of control, drawing people from both sides arguing over this controversy. You play as Adam Jensen, an ex-cop and lead security for Sarif Industries, who will unravel a hidden conspriacy among individuals who want to seek a hidden agenda. The background stories in the game is genuinely impressive when reading EBooks (or scholarly articles). The main plot is well paying close attention to, allowing you to make certain decisions in the game that will benefit or hinder you.\n\nOne of the best parts in the game is dynamic dialogue  and persuasion. Arguably, this dialogue system is well-written and your dialogue choices would not always work in multiple occasions when talking to important characters in the game. The stealth system is really, I mean really, really outstanding. Sure, you can "Pew pew pew, I can shoot people", but being stealthy and conduct "passive" takedowns feels great. I strongly recommend doing stealth and passive takedowns to get the best experience in this game. I guarantee it. The hacking mechanic is good at first, but the reward system is...too easy to achieve. However, hacking can really make a difference and ease a lot better to passby enemies without too much difficulty.\n\nThe negative aspects in this Director's Cut are the overwhelming number of bugs, exploits, less optimized than the original DE:HR and TML, and lack of attention/patches from the developers. This is absolutely unacceptable from the developers. At times, the Director's Cut version is a cash cow for owners who have the original DE:HR & TML. It really is for the original owners, including myself. In my personal honest opinion, people who have the original copy should not get the Director's Cut since there's little change and no game fixes for the Director's Cut. However, if you want to support the developers to make future Deus Ex sequels/games, you can.\n\nDeus Ex: Human Revolution was released in August 2011 and received rave reviews and awards. There's no doubt that Deus Ex: Human Revolution was a fantastic game that every gamer should experience. For those who never play the franchise, you must get this game (best get the Director's Cut at -75% or -80% off for $5 or $4 USD or regional equivalent). For those who have the original copies of DE:HR and TML, I suggest that the Director's Cut is not worth getting due to unaddressed technical and in-game problems, but you can still buy the Director's Cut if you want to. The Director's Cut has my highest recommendation for newcomers and "cautious" recommendation for the original owners.","April 4, 2015","true","44.8"," 98 of 105 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","98","105","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/238010/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Deus Ex as a series has since its inception in 2000 been synonymous with its commitment to player choice. Though the freedom it proposed to offer only extended as far as the game had been designed to allow (as does every game by their very nature), its strength was in concealing these limits well enough that your actions still felt independent.\n\nHuman Revolution (and its Director’s Cut, which is what I will be reviewing and has been my first exposure to the game) intends to carry this torch forward, but rather than simply revive a franchise that has been dormant since the less positively received Invisible War in 2003, Human Revolution presents itself as a fresh start and a chance to redefine Deus Ex. In the process they’ve created a game that often feels ready to fall apart at a moment’s notice, but is uniquely fascinating in that despite all its faults Human Revolution still seems to accomplish virtually everything it intended to.\n\nWhat Human Revolution does best is keep the player in the dark without telegraphing this with obvious plot holes or unavailable mechanics. As Adam Jensen, previous head of security for Serif industries brought back to life through an experimental human augmentation surgery, I felt from the very beginning sufficiently capable for what the game threw at me. I was informed, technologically and physically superior to my enemies, and clear as to what my role was in all of this.\n\nHuman Revolution manages to keep this up an astoundingly long time, keeping its narrative tightly concealed even when it seems to be spilling open before you. This is largely accomplished through Human Revolution ultimately being less about individuals, but organizations and ideas. The comically evil villains teased at the beginning of the game are quickly eclipsed by motives and plans far bigger and more radical than their mundane attempts at intimidation which are little more than a front. Human Revolution is a game with big aspirations that excels at asking complex, difficult questions with the intelligence they require and a lack of simple solutions to choose between.\n\nTranshumanist and metaphysical debate as to the ethical implications of humanity accelerating its own evolution are at the center of all of this, but rather than creating two sides characterized by extreme extrapolations of their ideologies for the player to choose between, Human Revolution intentionally muddies the water so as to require the player to come to their own conclusions as to whose (if anyone’s) side they should choose. The ideas it presents are complicated and logical in a way that is rarely seen in games, which more often fall back to black and white views of morality even as they assume to be more intelligent than a collection of tired, easy clichés.\n\nHuman Revolution never falls into this trap, going so far as to omit many of the gaming’s standard illustrations of choice and consequence to avoid simplifying itself for the sake of convenience. There are no morality bars which swell and dip with each conversation, no side quests locked out by binary choices or indicators informing you that your decisions have consequences. In this way Human Revolution feels refreshingly unhindered by the freedom that ironically tends to lock games down, allowing you to approach situations and conversations on whatever terms you feel appropriate, and then requiring you to deal with whatever happens later.\n\nUpgrades in the form of unlocked augments serve as a much more reserved skill tree than we have grown used to seeing, but rather than narrowing your options for growth Human Revolution has gone to great lengths to trim its progression system down to its most meaningful components. Skill points came very slowly throughout the game, but each time I received one it presented an important choice that had the potential to extensively alter my style of play. I found myself paying a great deal of attention with how I spent each of my points, giving me a greater attachment to my play style and a more noticeable sense of improvement than I initially expected.\n\nWhether I was smooth talking a guard to let me by or opting to slip in through an air duct, my actions created natural ripples which often extended further than I even realized. This feeling that I was a part of a world which reacted and changed depending on how I interacted with it, made Human Revolution exceedingly engaging and surprising. It’s rare for me to feel like I’m inhabiting an actual developed world when I play a game, but no matter how long I spent with Human Revolution I rarely saw the edges where that illusion breaks and I’m reminded that these are just images on a screen.\n\nUnfortunately though that means when those edges do appear, they’re that much more jarring and disappointing, even more so in this case as when Human Revolution fails it does so in ways you can’t unsee and which don’t go away. Bugs and glitches abound, from spotty hit detection to excessive clipping to instances of guards seeing/not seeing me when they should/shouldn’t to weird animation hiccups and general issues in presentation. More pressing than technical breakdowns though is how disconnected enemies felt from their environment. Repetitive patrol patterns and alert cooldown timers I could deal with, but looking at enemies standing above a stairwell unsure how to proceed, or having them crouch idly outside a vent I had just crawled into rather than proceed in after me made it hard to view my adversaries as people rather than models running on scripts with some very narrow parameters.\n\nHuman Revolution makes up a lot of the slack created by its incapable patrols with level designs I loved exploiting and experimenting within, often discovering routes where I least expected it and feeling incredibly clever each time I found a new solution to a problem I’d been stuck at. This is stripped away completely though in each of the games widely criticized boss fights, which amount to giant warts on a better game than they deserve to be a part of. They’re boring, simple, allow effectively no room to experiment, and are typically so easy as to make me wish they had simply been replaced with a cutscene that would at least have taken less time.\n\nThe worst offender in regards to wasting your time however isn’t a boss fight (or not entirely, that is), but the mini campaign originally released as DLC, The Missing Link. In the Director’s Cut this is integrated directly into the story as you play, but it is so abundantly clear it wasn’t originally a part of the game that you’d never mistake it for anything but an underwhelming add-on unceremoniously popping up at a pivotal point in Human Revolution proper. It’s a very tedious, meandering mission which essentially resets your progress in the game up to that point and takes several hours before it’s even clear why you should care about what’s going on, at which point it’s very nearly over.\n\nThere are so many rough edges to Deus Ex: Human Revolution that it would be easy to pick it apart bit by bit as half-baked and overambitious. Doing so though would miss what makes it so impressive and interesting. It’s a game with so many layers, of interconnected systems and the  dynamics that crop up between them, that even when one element breaks down it is held up by everything working together with it to create an experience that feels so uncharacteristically AAA. Human Revolution takes a lot of big risks with its design, not all of which work and some will likely fail to resonate with certain players, but its willingness to commit to itself feels inspired in a way I haven’t felt from a big budget game in quite some time.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","June 28, 2015","true","25.0"," 92 of 100 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","92","100","2","6"

This is essentially a glorified (and badly-executed) patch/cash grab, which reworks a few things (mainly boss fights and DLC integration), but breaks a lot of things that were already fixed in patches.\n\nThe reworked boss fights are great, especially for those who prefer the stealth/non-lethal approach and had trouble dealing with the bosses in the original version. The Missing Link DLC's integrated into the game now, though it still feels disjointed, and an option to skip it or launch it from the menu instead of having to go through it on every playthrough would have been nice.\n\nUnfortunately, in everything else, this "ultimate" edition of the game falls flat on its face compared to the original DXHR. Performance is worse, the game takes up nearly twice as much space (18.2 GB vs 10.6 GB for the original + DLC) for no apparent reason, and bugs that were fixed in the original version are back, along with some that weren't even in the original release (look here for a list: http://steamcommunity.com/app/238010/discussions/0/810939350891608249/), lending credence to the idea that they used an older build of the game for development. The much-complained-about gold tint's gone, but I'm not certain that change was intentional, because post-processing (which includes the gold filter) simply does not work. Depth of field doesn't work either, and a lot of the textures have problems appearing correctly.\n\nI've uploaded a few comparison screenshots here so you can see the graphical issues I'm talking about: http://imgur.com/a/AjaRg\n\nIf you don't own Human Revolution yet, find a retail copy of the original if you can; it's not available on the Steam store anymore. You'll miss out on the DLC, but at least you won't have to play through a bug-infested main game. If you already have the original, don't bother buying this unless you _really_ want to see the updated boss fights, do a New Game+ playthrough (you'll have to start from the beginning, though; saves from the original don't carry over), and/or listen to the developer's commentary, because that's all the Director's Cut really has to offer.\n\nEDIT 2014-03-29: kamil950 shares that while the original game's been removed from the Steam store, other digital stores still have the standard edition + DLCs which can be activated on Steam.

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME !!!\n\nDirector's Cut is a scam. The game uses an old version of the original game, which means it has all the bugs that were patched years ago in THE ORIGINAL GAME! Only handful were fixed in DC. In addition to the new bugs players have found, this version also seems to have downgraded graphics, such as low quality SSAO, broken Post Processing, streched textures, missing colors etc.\n\nGame's forums on Steam and on Eidos site shows no one in the company - including moderates - care about this game. Steam discussions page shows at least 144 unfixed, missing features/bugs for this game.\n\nThe only "enhancement" in this version is the toned down yellow tint a.k.a. ♥♥♥♥ filter, which IMO was too much in some areas of the original game. It's an artistic question. I personally prefer it off just because I have finished the game and found it hiding details in otherwise dated looking game. I also like more vibrant colors in general. They could've just toned it down in the areas where it was too much, not in the whole game. There should've been at least an option to turn it back on if desired.\n\nIf you like the toned down yellow tint in DC, you are better off with the original as you get far better results by trying out different SweetFX profiles.\n\n\nTo people who own the original and TML:\n\nPlay those instead. You save HDD/SSD space, have the best bug-free experience with less chance to get graphical glitches. Yes, the boss battles were questionable, but you are only missing slightly more open areas in boss battles that were probably done by some trainee in one weekend anyway.\n\n\nTo people who don't own the original nor TML:\n\nFind a boxed copy on your local store's bargain bin or get an activation code for Steam from a legitimate cd-key market site. Don't worry about TML (The Missing Link). It's like the fourth episode in Duke Nukem 3D. Unnecessary. Just a nice extra. TML only explains "three days in statis" and is attached to the main story in DC.\n\nThere was no need for explanation really. I didn't even notice days were passed at that point of the game. You can get a key for TML online, e.g. Amazon if you really want.","September 16, 2014","false","1.4"," 364 of 497 people (73%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","73","364","497","15","7"

The Missing Link's boss encounter was a much better example of how this idea should have been approached. The revisited boss fights are interesting, but not worth the price of admission alone. The true reward is simply playing the game again, Missing Link included, all the way through in this updated format.\n\nI wish there were a few new side quests on offer here (outside of the Tong rescue mission - which was great to play for the first time).

This game gives you something to think about in regards to the morals and ethics of technological impacts on society. This concept is part of the core of the story. The one drawback regarding this is you'll have to use your imagination to fill in some of the gaps. A lot of information regarding this concept in the Deus Ex world is gotten through emails, ebooks, radio, TV, and random people talking on the streets. The story definitley had potential to be more. There wasn't enough character development for many of the characters in the game. All the antagonists were pretty shallow, even some of the people in the side-quests had more personality than these guys.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, if the thought of sneaking around gives you joy, then you'll like this game; however, if you're looking for some solid stealth gameplay, this may not be for you.  The enemies are generally easy to sneak by. They patrol back and forth in an area, but they never go beyond the area where you may be hiding. I like being sneaky, so I didn't mind so much, but it could have been better.  Going lethal is fun though, and may even be more challenging than stealth because your character is not immortal like in other modern FPSs.\n\nFor $20, the game is worth playing, and if you're interested in a dystopian, stealth, FPS, RPG style game, you'll find plenty of replay value.","November 8, 2014","true","82.9"," 83 of 100 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","83","100","2","0"

I also have not found any bugs related to graphics.\nGameplay is a mix of first and third person shooting with cover and rpg elements. From stealth takedowns, advancing through enemies cloaked, shooting tranquilizing darts, to hardcore combat with a variety of firearms, explosives and scenarios elements to use at your advantage, the combat in this game couldn't be better, it's as if the game says " hey, choose one of these, and do it your way! ". It will often give you choices, for example : at the first mission, you could go straight to the objctive, or try to rescue the hostages among the way, an option speaking of wich, has more then one way to be accomplished. It's one of those games where you're given freedom inside a linear level path, and this is called replay value!\nThere is an Augment system, each time you gain a level or buy a praxis kit, you can upgrade something that might have a huge impact on gameplay : reaching higher places you otherwise wouldn't be able to, skipping a set of enemies by going invisible, breaking through walls and moving heavy objects to reveal shortcuts and rewards, it encourages you to play again and again in different ways and once you finish the game, you enter NG+ with all the previous augments you had.\nThe story is well written, I won't spoil anything, the plot makes you want to search for answer at all moments so expect twists, also, there are four distinct endings depending on your choices, and in case you can't get enough of it, hit the wiki for more Deus Ex universe.\nSound effects are okay, voice acting is great, Elias Toufexis made Jensen come alive as well as the other actors with other characters.\nThe game can be maxed out on mid-end machines and run smoothly, I'm running at 1080p on 650ti Boost, i5 3570 and 4GB Ram.\nI'd recommend this game for everyone, in fact...

Is it right or wrong?\nDeus Ex: Human Revolution is one of those games that are a must for FPS, RPG, and cyberpunk fans. It even brings up Transhumanism, which has been debated for a very long time.\n\nI already finished the game with Pacifist and on the Give me Deus Ex difficulty.\n(I just felt like bragging here :D...keep reading)\n\nSTORY:In the year 2027, technology has advanced to great lengths and corporations are increasing in greed. You are Adam Jensen, an Ex-SWAT working as security for Sarif Industries. A company that plans to change human evolution for the future. When a special faction raids Sarif Industries, Jensen's whole career changes. As Jensen, you will explore Detroit, Hengsha (in China), and some other locations around the world, discovering new secrets and finding truths.\n\nVisuals:While DXHR might look a bit dated, there is still a ton of attention put to detail. Want an example? When you go inside any room, look up. The ceilings are designed with a lot of different abstract patterns. Hengsha is very impressive as the developers were able to take modern day China and put a cyberpunk twist to it. I'd recommend even stopping for a bit and just looking at the statues and architecture of the buildings. "Future Detroit" might not look as interesting, but put on some headphones and enjoy the city sounds.\n\nSound:Michael McCann is like a God for "futuristic-vibe" music. All the music that plays goes very well with what is happening on screen. While playing, you will also overhear many conversations by civilians and guards. Many sounds in the enviornment will help immerse you into this dark futuristic world such as aircraft passing by and just feeling the wind blow.\n\nVoice acting is also well done. Jensen definitely sounds like a character who is eager to find the truth behind everything and the people you engage in conversation with will have realistic diaogue and body movements.\n\nGameplay:This is where the game shines the most. You can choose if you want to go in guns blazing or be sneaky peaky like. More often, you will want to stealth since sadly, there is not much incentive to go loud (besides finding some ammo and credits). Stealth opens up many different ways to finish an objective.\n\nYou can hack a turret to turn it against your enemies. You can find a vent and just avoid all combat. Hell, you can even finish the game without killing a single person.\n\nThe Director's Cut also has a mode called "New Game +". Once you beat the game, all your augmentations will carry over in your next playthrough. (This makes Hard difficulty rather easy). The only thing about the Hard difficulty is that enemies are more aggressive and have more.\n\nShould you buy Deus Ex: Human Revolution?If you want a Cyberpunk FPS game, with a yellow color theme (this is not supposed to be offensive), then you will love this game.\n\nThis Director's Cut includes the DLC from the original game, improves the games graphics (the yellow filter from the original game is gone though), and includes developer commentary.\nThe game goes on frequent sales for $4-$5, which is an absolute steal for a game like this.\n\nBegin augmenting your first person experience by purchasing this game.","December 21, 2015","true","51.7"," 52 of 60 people (87%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","87","52","60","8","3"

It took around 46 hours to beat, which is a little faster than my combined 49 hours in HR and The Missing Link.\n\nIf you're familiar with HR, the big question you're wondering is probably "is the DC worth it?"  I'd say it is, but it's not without its hitches.  There's also the fact that you can't buy the old HR at all on Steam, though it's still sold through other retailers like Amazon or Green Man Gaming and so on.  If you've never played the original Human Revolution, CTRL+F "for those new" since I can give a review of the base game here as well.\n\nThe boss fights were noticeably improved as far as catering to people building Jensen as a stealthy hacker.  Excepting the final boss, the three other fights had additional rooms added where you can access a security system to turn turrets against your enemy or activate other defenses.  You can win these fights without firing a single shot now, but you need specific augs to do it all.\n\nThere's a New Game Plus feature, but you obviously have to finish the game to be able to use it.  And you can't use your old HR saves, which I whined about a little, but I still went through the whole DC anyway.  You don't get to keep your weapons from your last game, but you can keep your augs at least.\n\nThe DC incorporates The Missing Link where it falls in the story, when you leave Hengsha for the second time.  You're still subjected to having your augs reset and weapons taken away, and while you get everything back once you clear that part of the game, some people might find it annoying to start from square one so near the end of the entire package.  The preorder DLC for HR is here too, though it's a lot more subtle in integration.\nThe AUD “grenades” are a godsend for the new boss battles, even if you're a master hacker.\n\nI'd suggest not listening to the commentary your first time through since it spoils some of the story, but it also really disrupts the flow of the game.  There's no visible marker of where you're to stand to activate the commentary, but you get a little Infolink icon and a prompt to start if you're in the right place.  They seem to stop if you move away from the area enough or get an in-game Infolink transmission, so you unfortunately are gonna have to stand around a bit if you want to listen to everything.\nAnd there's eight hours of it.\n\nAs for the hitches, I found the game ran a bit worse than the original HR at times for no real reason, mostly things like frames suddenly dropping or things getting stuttery.  The audio also got extremely quiet at times like there was commentary playing, except I had that feature disabled.  And there were apparently a lot of bugs added back into the game for the DC, but I only really ran into one other than above and it was minor.  Some people have had worse issues, so it's a “your mileage may vary” situation.\n\nBut yeah, in summary, if you liked HR and want an excuse to go through it again, you can generally get it for $4 when it's on sale which is ridiculous for what you get.  The additions are nice, but you're buying something you own already for just a few changes and DLC integration.  If you've never played HR, $4 is a damned good price for what you get.\n\n----\n\nAnd for those new to the game, Human Revolution is a first- and third-person stealth-based shooter-RPG.  Despite that description, you're given a pretty wide range of methods to deal with whatever situations you find yourself in.  Such as, you're hiding in a room full of armed mooks and boxes.  You could just pop up and start firing, or you could watch your radar for their patrol patterns and systematically knock out each person and hide their bodies, or you could just turn invisible and skip fighting everyone by ducking into an air vent.  There's no right way to play, but some ways are easier than others.\n\nThe story starts with an attack on Sarif Industries which results in the death of a scientist team as well as nearly killing Adam Jensen, the protagonist.  The game cuts to six months later and Jensen, now an augmented human, is called out of sick leave to deal with the thugs who have taken over a Sarif manufacturing plant.  He runs into a hacker who promptly kills himself and then Jensen has to get into the Detroit Police's morgue to retrieve the hacker's cranial datavault, and things progress from there.  Will you try to sweet-talk the desk sergeant and get unrestricted access to the police department...or just sneak in and risk being shot by the police?\n\nYou're given a lot of freedom to build Jensen in the way that suits your playstyle best.  Doing quests and dispatching enemies gives EXP which leads to Praxis points, or you can find/buy Praxis Kits in the world, and with those you're able to activate/upgrade your augmentations.  You start with a small selection which gives great room to grow.  Will you bolster your hacking aug to cut through security with ease?  Maybe invest in the jumping aug and the Icarus Landing System to safely explore areas?  Arm stabilizers to improve gun accuracy even while moving?  Or maybe you'll max out your battery and cloak to just sneak through areas.\n\nEven though the game is largely played in first-person perspective, you can take cover and sidle along walls which shift you into third-person view.  You can then blindfire while in cover, peek out for better accuracy, or just stick to a corner to be able to see around it.  It's very hard to play this like a typical first-person shooter since Jensen is so fragile and loud guns will draw more enemies to shoot at you.  You do naturally heal and can reduce damage with augments, but you still can't stand in the open and expect great results.  Not easy, but still doable.  My first time through HR I went the loud lethal Rambo route, and I went through the DC as a stealthy non-lethal hacker.  The experiences were quite different.\n\n\nYou'd probably like DEHR for its near-future cyberpunk story full of conspiracy, or if you want a game with a variety of ways to dispatch enemies and handle situations, or maybe if you really like customizing a playable character in a variety of skills, or maybe you just want to explore the world and hack into computers to read everyone's emails.  You might not like it as much if you're going to play it like a typical FPS, but it works for a cover-based shooter.  It's still a bit of an RPG, so if checking a skills screen to manually increase skills and having to remember that you can now turn invisible or see through walls is a challenge, things might be a little difficult for you.  Even then, if you like the idea of a stealthy game, I'd suggest this.  It wasn't my first stealth game, but it was the first one I really got into and enjoyed.","May 2, 2015","true","51.3"," 37 of 38 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","37","38","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/238010/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","The original Deus Ex is widely considered to be an iconic game – its scope, ideas, vision... it was ahead of its time, and gaming conventions first seen in the first game have reverberated within the game industry ever since. Seems like a tough act to follow, but Human Revolution has not only managed to be a game that's worthy of the name, but a worthy game. Period.\n\nHuman Revolution opens with the protagonist, Adam Jensen, being brutally attacked and downright nearly killed as mercenaries invade the headquarters of his employer, Sarif Industries. In Robocop fashion, Jensen is rebuilt and augmented with the latest in biomechanical technology. Jensen doesn't get long to rest though, because six months later, another attack is made on Sarif and he is sent in to handle things. In true series fashion, what starts out as a local terrorist attack spirals wildly into a global adventure as Jensen uncovers the pieces of a global-scale conspiracy to influence the future of humanity.\n\nAs you would expect, choice is the name of the game. From basic things like whether to do a particular side-quest or not, to conversation options, to what augmentations you want. There's plenty of flexibility when it comes to your choices. Choice even permeates elements like what weapons to take with you, as even with an expanded inventory you can only carry so many weapons at a time and so much ammo. My favorite setup was a pistol and assault rifle combo, customized with silencers so I could maintain stealth, but there's a wide variety of weapons from rocket launchers, to laser guns, crossbows to stun guns, along with various grenade and mines. The pace of combat frequently shifts, and patience is not just a virtue, but is completely a must. Unless you want to try and blaze your way through a level, waiting, watching, and attacking from behind is the order of the day. In the beginning stun weapons are useful for a stealthy take down. There are some sections that force you to go all gun-ho, but usually you can suss these out ahead of time, and prepare accordingly. Sometimes you may not have the right skill-set or augmentation to get by unnoticed, so you will have to fight your way through.\n\nThe environments are huge, detailed, and full of secrets. The developers sought to "tell a story" with the environmental details, and they have succeeded. Looking around in an apartment can tell you an entire story of its occupant without ever hearing a single line of dialogue, and in today's "in-your-face-obvious" world of game storytelling, I can't commend Eidos Montreal enough for this. The audio fares equally well, combining a stellar sci-fi score with immersive environmental ambience and sound effects that truly draw you into the world. Combined with the huge amount of detail in the graphics, you have a game that truly creates a place for you to get lost in. The voice acting is solid, though the Asian accents are goofy and borderline offensive at times. Adam Jensen is expertly cast, offering a gritty performance that is equal parts JC Denton and Chris Nolan's Batman. Where the actor truly succeeds, however, is in showcasing that Adam isn't a one-note wonder. He does sarcasm, humor, and compassion equally well, which is something I was worried about before I played the game in its entirety.\n\nPlaying through Human Revolution, it was hard to find anything truly wrong with it. In terms of technical polish, it was one of the most polished release-builds I'd seen in a while, with few-to-no glaring technical hiccups. The only time where I felt genuine disappointment was in the last area of the game. I won't go into specifics, but unless you've been one of those people who've been trying to blast their way through the game, this last section can be very jarring. Almost uncomfortable. Still, the actual 'ending' ending, apart from a strange boss fight, does really hit home what the game is all about. Personally I felt the ending could have been a bit better and more conclusive in some respects, but the game does set things up so that the choice you have to make at the end really makes you stop and think. Coming from a background of having not played the original Deus Ex (don't hurt me!), I can't comment from a fans perspective. Make no mistake though, franchise fan or not, this is a good game – challenging, addictive, immersive...provided you like stealth-based action – there hasn't been an action/RPG this good in a while.\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","February 10, 2015","true","20.7"," 62 of 83 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","62","83","3","0"

Which brings me to my next thing: if you dont own this game, you are probably doing something wrong with your life.\n\nSeriously, in my opinion, this is a top ten all time great game. It has everything....great gameplay, great story, and even now, great graphics. Additionally, the Directors Cut did a great job of optimizing everything, making the graphics look even better, seamlessly integrating the DLC into the campaign, and generally making what was already a great game a definite all timer.\n\nOne of the main issues I had with the original version was that, although you are encouraged to craft your Adam Jensen in whatever way suits your gameplay preferences best, when it came to the boss battles, you could easily be completely dominated over and over because they forced you into stand up fights, which dont work well when you are playing a completely stealth build. Even with the OP Typhoons, it was still pretty cheap. What the Directors Cut did is create new areas and program the boss battles a little bit differently so that, should you choose stealth and planning over might and brawn, you could still come out on top. I really appreciated this change above and beyond all the other tweaks and adjustments. It also, by virtue of this fact, increased its replay value by quite a bit.\n\nAnyway, I will just leave it here: I have played this game on all platforms, and it has been and always will be one of my favorites. With the new Deus Ex slated for release in the not too distant future (no pun intended), you owe it to yourself to try this one out if you havent already.","May 23, 2015","true","45.9"," 41 of 49 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","41","49","0","6"

He is mortally wounded and converted later into an enhanced cyborg.\n\nThere's a high graphic detail, which allowed me to admire some beautiful landscapes. Among them one in particular is still in my memories. The secondary characters are poorly characterized, and this is a shame, but the choice that is given to us to respond to the various dialogues on the basis of what we want allows us to give some peculiar personality to the protagonist.\n\nFurthermore, the possibility to choose the skills of the protagonist based on the type of game you want to play (ranging from the action to stealth) is quite guessed, so we can complete the game several times in different ways, although not influencing the ending, unfortunately.\n\nThe only flaw? The difficulty! Do not get me wrong, it is quite high in the general gameplay, especially if played in stealth mode, but I personally found the boss a bit too easy to overcome!\n\nI loved to play this game from the beginning, so I recommend it to everyone.\n\nItalian Version:\nPartendo dal presupposto che sono una fan sfegatata della saga di Metal Gear Solid fin dal primo capitolo, ritrovare un gameplay che se giocato in maniera stealth sia profondo quanto quello evocatomi anni fa da MGS ha reso la mia esperienza di gioco più emozionante.\n\nLa trama è intrigante e parecchio intrecciata, cosa che spinge il giocatore sia a completarlo sia ad incuriosirsi anche nel compiere sidequest per capire al meglio il mondo di gioco e le tematiche trattate quali, ad esempio, il transumanesimo e le implicazioni etico-morali del progresso scientifico.\n\nRacconta di un uomo, Adam Jensen, che ritrovatosi coinvolto in un attacco terroristico rivolto verso le industrie per cui lavora come addetto alla sicurezza, le Sarif Industries, viene ferito mortalmente e trasformato, successivamente, in un cyborg potenziato.\n\nIl dettaglio grafico è elevato, il che mi ha regalato alcune splendide panoramiche da ammirare, delle quali ne ho conservato una in particolare. I personaggi secondari sono poco caratterizzati, e questo è un peccato, ma la scelta che ci vien data di rispondere ai vari dialoghi in base a ciò che vogliamo ci permette di dare una personalità nostra, al protagonista.\n\nInoltre la possibilità di scegliere le abilità del protagonista in base al tipo di gioco che vuoi effettuare (dall'action allo stealth) è parecchio azzeccata, così da poter completar il gioco più volte in modo diverso, nonostante non influisca nel finale, purtroppo.\n\nUnica pecca? La difficoltà! Non fraintendetemi, è abbastanza elevata nel gameplay generale, specie se giocato in modo stealth, ma ho trovato personalmente i boss un po' troppo facili da superare!\n\nHo adorato giocarci fin dal primo momento, per cui lo consiglio a tutti.","April 9, 2014","true","118.0"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","31","36","0","6"

The biggest issue is in looks, where the gold filter has been massively toned down. Even if you disliked the gold however this change disrupts a lot of textures, effects and backgrounds and makes the game look odd in several sections. Also since the game was originally designed around the gold you're suddenly navigating endless grey hallways without much unique about them, which is disappointing. There are also scattered texture glitches, and on my PC the loading stutters are back, though they were originally fixed. In short it looks and performs worse.\n\nThe DLC being integrated is poorly handled. The silenced sniper rifle is available almost immediately and is way too powerful for the game. The automated unlocking mechanisms are plentiful enough to make investing in the hacking tree much less important than it originally was. The Missing Link add-on mission still resets your augmentations, then the game clumsily gives them back to you at the end along with what you just earned again, making you way overexperienced heading toward the finale.\n\nGame design and balance is a tough thing. Throwing in weird overpowered items can throw off this carefully made balance, and changing art styles via a simple processing change can't negate years of work designing the game around a different style. The Director's Cut changes the game in ways detrimental to the intended experience, and even the added boss options feel pasted on to a different skeleton. The best way to play Human Revolution is the original version, and to play the Missing Link add-on separately, as was intended. This version is an added expense for a lesser version.","March 25, 2014","false","8.7"," 43 of 58 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","43","58","0","2"

Since I had already put the precursor to this title on a pedestal and was hyped to all hell, how does this game fare in comparison?\n\nNot bad, actually.\n\nBecause this game is a prequel, it is totally fine to jump in and start playing it even without playing the previous games, although I caught many references and call backs to Deus Ex throughout. In fact, I’d probably recommend most players today to start with this game, as Deus Ex hasn’t really aged all that well in terms of graphics/ mechanics.\n\nDeus Ex was a Cyberpunk dystopian FPS/RPG hybrid that was full of deep choices and free-form gameplay. The storyline dealt with world spanning conspiracies and epic world ending narratives, but Deus Ex: Human Revolution takes a smaller, more focused approach, mainly dealing with the basic morality question of human augmentation, corporate espionage, and how technology positively and/or negatively impacts the “natural” human experience. This smaller approach was somewhat disappointing at first as it’s not nearly as “epic” as the first game, but it still told an interesting story, full of little peeks at the larger conspiracies overall. The main character has the  pretty cliché motivation of revenge and delves into a complex web of intrigue that’ll keep you guessing until the very end. The ending is somewhat lackluster, but the upcoming sequel Mankind Divided promises more nuanced endings that depend on factors through the game. All in all, the many different character’s motivations and the many moral choices you make in the game paint a convincing near future cyberpunk world that is easy to get immersed in.\n\nThis game isn’t the prettiest, being initially released in 2011, but even back then it didn’t look so great. 2011 was the year Skyrim, Dead Space 2, L.A. Noire, Battlefield 3, and Arkham City were released. Deus Ex: Human Revolution already looked dated back then compare to these titles. However, the game remedies this with clear art direction. Most locations are flush with a calming and surreal old yellowed parchment art style that bathes the world in amber-yellow hues. The effect was designed to give the world a Renaissance style, with people learning so much about the human body and augmentation that extreme advancements were occurring rapidly, without the necessary societal changes to keep up. There is also plenty of Icarus/ Daedalus parallels as well, with humanity flying too close to the sun and getting burned as a result. Animations are mostly decent, but facial animations are pretty wooden and everyone looks somewhat like plastic. However, this game’s strikingly distinct art style more than makes up for the lackluster animations and textures and is one of the more memorable parts of the game.\n\nThe great part of this game’s design is it’s free-form approach to quests. You can complete the game without killing a single character (except the boss fights), and in some situations you can talk your way into areas that would normally be considered trespassing. For example, a quest near the beginning of the game requires you to retrieve something from a police station, which is off limits to civilians. However, you can either talk your way in (using CASIE augmentations if necessary), stealth your way in through a back alley, or kick in the front door and start shooting people in the face. Anytime a game allows me multiple approaches makes me feel like I’m actually using my own wits and not just blindly following a waypoint, although there are some quests that boil down to just that, unfortunately. Nevertheless, this level of freedom does a good job of reminding me why Deus Ex 1 was so good, as there were multiple approaches in that game as well. Going in guns blazing is viable, although the shooting mechanics feel a bit clunky compared to other FPSes.\n\nThis is also an RPG in addition to being an FPS, and there are different augmentations(skills) to put Praxis Points (Level ups) into. For example, if you’re making a loud, guns blazing character, you may want to invest in recoil management, Dermal Armor, and the Typhoon Explosive System, essentially an AOE attack that blows everything up in a 360 angle around you. However, if you’re a sneaky beaky kind of guy you may want to upgrade your ability to see enemy’s cones of vision on your minimap, as well as cloaking yourself. If you want to explore all the nooks and crannies the game has to offer you may want to upgrade your legs to jump super high and land from great heights without taking fall damage. There are many different things to level up, although I wished there were a bit more. It looks like Mankind Divided will have many more skills to try out, which I’m very excited for. One thing I felt was pretty OP was the cloaking in this game. Enemies can still hear you running around, but as long as you have plenty of cyberboost proenergy candy bars, you can make your way through most levels just by constantly gorging yourself on candy bars with cloak activated and running through the levels, awkwardly sidestepping enemies like Harry Potter with his invisibility cloak. Hopefully in Mankind Divided they nerf this, or at least make special enemies who can see through cloak or something.\n\nDeus Ex: Human Revolution is a great Cyberpunk FPS/RPG that everyone who has an interest in the genre should play. It’s a prequel to one of the best games ever made in my opinion, and while it doesn’t quite live up to the first game, is still a fantastic experience in its own right. This game often goes on sale for $5, and at that price, it’s a no brainer considering you’ll get 20-25 hours of solid entertainment out of the experience. I’m very excited for Mankind Divided.","May 4","true","28.5"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","0"

Set 25 years before the original, Human Revolution is a very convincing take on the FPS/infiltration/adventure genre with yet another compelling story whose ramifications deepen as you progress through the game. The numerous characters are supported by a very solid voice acting cast, and the quality of the writing helps create a strong feeling of immersion.\n\nThe game gives you a degree of freedom in how you handle situations, but in spite of providing you with a vast array of weapons, it greatly rewards stealth and non-lethal takedowns. You are also given multiple choices in how you approach interactions with other characters, and can sometimes persuade them to help you a little more than they were prepared to. As the plot thickens, so does the level design: between the first mission and the later stages of the game, the areas you have to work your way through become more and more complex, and stealth becomes more and more of a challenge.\n\nLuckily, progress through the game allows you to upgrade your character's abilities with a simple-yet-rewarding XP system. Will you invest points into your hacking abilities? Enhance your social skills with a body language analyzer? Upgrade your dermal armor in anticipation of unavoidable combat situations? The choice is yours! This system succeeds in giving you more options without ever turning you into an overpowered killing machine. On the highest difficulty setting, combat will always be hazardous as you can die very quickly: all the more reason to go for a stealth-based approach.\n\nThe Director's Cut version is supposed to offer revamped boss fights (the original ones were an abomination). A commendable effort that is supposed to give you more options, but shooting them in the face remains the most viable one. A more convincing selling point is the integration of the game's only DLC campaign (The Missing Link) into the adventure. Good DLC, bratán - intriguing story elements, good characters and some well-designed new areas to infiltrate will provide for a very welcome extra few hours of gameplay.\n\nThe Missing Link almost makes the final two areas of the game a bit bland in comparaison. The penultimate one feels a lot simpler than what you've just been through, while the last one is simply disappointing - necessary from the story's viewpoint, but entirely forgettable when it comes to gameplay. Nonetheless, Director's Cut is a solid excuse to give this modern classic another go and, why not, get back into the Deus Ex universe in anticipation of Mankind Divided's release.","January 14","true","36.2"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

First, the integration of missing link into the main game is very smooth which makes it a better game as a whole. And some game mechanics are re-worked for example energy cell and enemy AI. Right now Enemy will notice you more easily and Jensen can regenerate two energy cells except the highest difficulty level.  The overhauled boss fights will allow more tactical approaches. The new level designs for those boss battles are quite interesting although I felt it's still easier to blaze your guns through. Overall this game is a very good if not the best action/role-playing games in recent years. Stealth/action/RPG lovers should try the game and the older players should get this upgrade too.","June 22, 2014","true","27.3"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","23","30","0","1"

It remains very faithful to the original game in all of the areas that mattered. Best of all, it has completely overhauled the series' weak spots into some of its strongest features. The cover system makes stealth through the levels possible and even rather fun. The melee takedown system is nicely balanced and clears up the stragglers a satisfying, conclusive manner.\n\nI've never liked the idea of robots or futuristic games, but this one gets it right. It grounds itself in reality by predicting where new and up-coming technologies will be in 15 years' time. It's evident that the developers have put a lot of thought into making this a grim but believable world. I get all smug every time I hear about augmentations on the news and how we're one step closer to the depressing orange world of Deus Ex. In a way, I want it to happen!\n\nDeus Ex's main strangth has always been the choices it presents to you and how it faithfully follows your decisions to the end. You can kill as many or as few people as you like and the game will continue to carry on as if what you did was how it was meant to have been done. Brilliantly, failing an objective won't result in a 'game over' screen but will instead fill you with so much guilt that you'll be tempted to lose several hours' worth of gaming to try and do it right. For example- a couple might be executed by terrorists and you'll think nothing of it. The second time you play through the game, you may be able to save both and they're so thankful they invite you back to their apartment for tea and biscuits. The third time, one might die and you have to give the news to the other one, which is more heart-breaking than it should be.\n\nThere are still lots of pointless areas for you to explore should you want to. The levels themselves aren't as large as in the original game, but are still large enough to give you a decent amount of freedom. Occasionally the environment feels 'levelly' but for the most-part it feels like you have the freedom to do as you please. You can develop your character as the game progresses in basic but meaningful ways and it adds even more replayability to an already exciting game. Oh, and the music is brilliant and very memorable. I particularly like how you can hear songs from the original game on in-game radios.\n\nThe game itself is a little rough around the edges and I fear that it may age worse than other games, but for now it's the king of the Deus Ex genre. Now that the boss fights have the same degree of freedom as the rest of the game there is absolutely no reason not to give this game a go if you haven't already. I believe that this game has rebooted the series in the same way as Doctor Who has done in recent years and I'm willing to accept sacrifices and changes to the game if it means that today's generation can feel how I did when I played the original all those years ago. That being said, to say that this game is merely a shadow of the original would be an injustice. It's a step in a new and exciting direction and I can't wait to see what they do with the franchise next.","December 7, 2013","true","31.6"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

Cyber punk games are really interesting because of the philosophy of the cultures. The factions of people who are for augmentations and those who are against it because they think its inhuman to do and against nature itself. A society always questioning the benefits and tradeoffs of disregarding some of your flesh in order to speed ahead of those around you in competitive areas.\n\nDynamic Design\n+ Dynamic Navigation from point to point\n+ Upgrades contribute to navigation\n\nGame is very dynamic with many interesting ways to get from Point A to Point B. The way you move around the environment depends up to you and what upgrades you get. The stealth in the game is great, and so are the ways you can sneak past enemies or use an object in order to lure them away from their defensive post.\n\nBosses\n+ Multiple ways to take down bosses\n\nThe bosses in Director's cut actually have multiple ways to take them down instead of just shooting and running and more shooting. You can actually use hacking and stealth to take down your enemies and there is various different ways to do it. This was a huge improvement over the original game and the main flaw it "used" to have now this game is easier to recommend thanks to the upgrade.\n\nConversations\nThe conversations are very interactive and can be quite hard at first to get what you want from the characters, however it feels really rewarding when you do smooth talk them into it.\n\nConclusion\nOverall i would say this is a very unique stealth game with  a great story.","November 27, 2013","true","49.8"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","0"

For atmosphere purposes: The game is best played during the evening and night. I talked to almost every individual that walks in the cities, read all emails, hacked all computers and read all e-books in the game. It costs a lot of time, but they contribute well to the brilliant story. I think in reality we are getting close to what happens in the game. For that matter the game is even more interesting and makes the time reading stuff worthwhile.\n\nPlaystyles\n\nThe first time I played the game by sneaking most of the time, and when appropriate use Q to put the guard in a deep sleep. I hardly killed anyone, except for the bosses of course.\n\nThe second time I used to be a ghost and sneak through every mission. Helped by my first time I finished the game, I knew exactly where all the vents and roofs were to avoid the enemy. Also you know how to use the augmentations for maximal potential. I managed to finish the game as pacifist and only knocked out Burke (from the missing link). I also managed to finish the missing link without using any augmentation. Unfortunately, although I was never noticed once, I didn’t get the foxiest of all hounds achievement. The second time I didn’t read the emails, books, didn’t talk with civilians anymore, and could finish the game in 15-20 hours.\n\nThe third time I changed the setting to “Give me Deus Ex” and I went in to go as a FPS, to kill everyone. The gameplay is totally different if you use another style, what makes the game worth to replay in a different style. The shootings are somewhat difficult, since a direct confrontation with a soldier, especially a heavy, is not easy. You will be killed easily, even if you have armor upgraded to the max. If you sniper a heavy, or sometimes even other soldiers, in the head, they turn around in a second and shoot directly at you, and they rarely miss. That is not very realistic in my opinion. I am used to shooters like Medal Of Honor: Allied Assault, Doom, CoD, Duke Nukem, but this is different. To my opinion this game is not really suitable as a shooter, although it is fun.\n\nMost of the augmentations/upgrades make sense and make the game better for Adam Jensen. All augmentation can contribute to improve a certain playstyle. And with all augmentations the game is really open to finish a certain situation on different ways.\n\nAtmosphere/Music/Visuals\n\nThe atmosphere is what makes the game so good. The music is outstanding and really creates an atmosphere to be soaked into. Every level and situation has different music what really fits. The cyberpunk lovers really got what they are looking for here!\n\nDeus Ex is a game about choice and unlike other games that advertise choice as a key aspect of the game and fail to deliver, Deus Ex delivers it. Many choices can have later in the game huge implications. I won’t spoil too much in here, but I definitely made some decisions I regretted later on.\n\nThe game looks really finished. I hardly encountered any errors while playing the game.\n\nNot so positive/negatives:\n\n- To cloak makes the game too easy. They could have let that out of the augmentations. If you cloak you can kill guards/enemies easy, walk away and hide. The soldiers most of the time only look around for some seconds but almost never are really going to explore the area to search for you. And if they do you cloak again and can kill them easily again. You can just stand before them with an upgraded gun and pop them in the head. No skills involved there.\n\n- The boss fights are far too easy. The Typhoon ammo is far too strong. 3 of the 4 bosses didn’t even struck me once and the battle sometimes lasted less than a minute. If you go into the fight with full battery, go into cloak-mode, use 2 typhoons and 1 or 2 rockets it is most of the time enough. The end-boss doesn’t even see you so won’t shoot you. You can add F4 (silent running) to it, so that it makes it even more impossible for an enemy to fight you.\n\n- The endings are a bit easy to choose. I would rather have seen that decisions in your style of playing would influence the ending. Now you can just hit one of the four buttons.\n\n- The hardest setting is hardly any more difficult than the normal mode, a bit disappointing. The second/third time you play the game, it is really easy since you know all the situations and the layout of the maps.\n\n- The movies/video could be a bit better. Personally I don’t care that much, but that would make the game even better than it already it.\n\nI can really recommend to play Deux Ex Human Revolution, but only if you want to invest some time in it. If you just finish it quickly, I think you miss out of a lot. Have fun playing this game!","April 19","true","123.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","3"

Missions allow you the freedom to complete them according to your preferences: You can choose to infiltrate a building with lethal or non-lethal means, to sneak around and never engage the enemy or to use hacking and turn existing security features to your side. From the outset, you're given all of the tools — guns, a takedown move (in both lethal and non-lethal flavors) and the skills to hack into systems — and let loose into the world.\n\nYou also have choices when it comes to your skills and abilities. You earn "praxis points" by gaining XP from main quests and side quests, which are good for spending on the "augmentations" you'd like. Earning XP has a lot more different minor ways — you’ll be more interested to explore more through secret paths to gain traveler/explorer/pathfinder XP and using non-lethal take down to your enemies to earn expedient and merciful XP really brings this game to the more maximum stealth game. There are abilities associated with each kind of play style — stealthy upgrades like a limited-time invisibility cloak (which I think is the most important skill that is super helpful to pass through guards waves, lasers, cameras, robots and etc. like a ghost if you like to play with non-lethal style), thicker skin for the pugilistic, hacking skills and etc.\n\nThis emphasis on choice — along with often brilliant level and mission design — makes playing Human Revolution a powerful experience. I went into missions tense, worked my way through waves of guards, talk and investigating people with people like a detective and challenges methodically and always felt satisfied by my progress. Human Revolution made me feel like a smart genius resourceful spy.\n\n\nPERFORMANCE\nThe game draws remarkable atmosphere between the sterility of the corporate world and the grit of the city with its cyberpunk, transhumanism, futuristic style. Office interiors feature clean lines and metallic surfaces; in trash-street corners, the sewer, the homeless huddle around flaming barrels for warmth.  It all comes back to that gold and that black. The color combination rivals teal and orange for its known visual appeal, but the color palette's impact goes beyond its attractiveness. In China, the term "black gold" refers to political corruption and corporate greed, key narrative elements in Human Revolution. The colors recall the brightness of modern machinery and the darkness of Detroit's alleyways, and evoke the works of Botticelli and Da Vinci, who ushered in a renaissance, just as David Sarif hopes to lead the world into a new era of enlightenment. There is so much meaning in this single detail.\n\n\nGAME TIPS\nAlways take a cover! — Combined with the stealth augmentation can provide with some excellent flanking maneuvers\n\nUpgrades! — Look for weapons upgrades or buy them. Remember to focus on upgrades that would help you not only offensively, like Recoil Reduction, but also defensively such as Dermal Plating.\n\nCarry around other weapons along with extra ammo; you never know what upgrades you may find for your extra weapons or what kind of situation you would need it for.\n\nUnlock Cloak System to give you temporary invincibility. It’s the most useful praxis in my opinion. It will let you pass undetected from guard waves and all the security systems such as camera, lasers gate, robots, turrets and etc. It will help you to earn extra 500 XP if you can get through the wave undetectably in each missions.\n\nDrink alcohol! — Whiskey, vodka, beer, spirits, and etc. I only know that alcohol drink in this game is to increase your health capacity almost in the end of the game. It’s kinda odd in that way but it’s cool and unique.\nTry to use the vent as often as possible, it sometimes leads you directly to the mission point and remain undetected as well as without needs to look for the security gate password to pass.\nREPLAYABILITY\nMight be sometimes will get it try with the “Give me Deus Ex” difficulty (hardest). Moreover, they have four different endings ! And you will unlock new game+ after you ended the game. Surprisingly, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is one of the best ending game ever made.\n\n\nVERDICT\n8.8/10\n\nIn addition, as the newbie in Deus Ex series, which Deus Ex: Human Revolution is my first Deus Ex series game; I’m eagerly looking forward with the upcoming sequel of Deus Ex: Human Revolution,  Deus Ex: Mankind Divided  next year, 2016. Moreover the main character name is almost similar with my name. Jensen <> Jhonson. It’s a pleasure when they are calling Jensen in the game. It’s like I’m interacting with them directly.

It talked about realistic things. The entire franchise was based around augmentations. Every thing the player was of their own choice. You can be stealthy, or go in guns blazing. You could be a pacifist, or a murderer.  The game kind of tells people to be pacifists. (You get more XP for being a pacifist). There are a lot of different ways to play the game. Do this, or don't do this. It *usually* has an eventual impact further in the game. Thus, it has plenty of replay value.  10/10 would get augmented again.","November 10, 2014","true","214.7"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","0"

The director's cut claims changed boss-fights, which would've been really nice, since they were one of the major weak points of DX:HR, but unfortunately what they've changed is equivalent to an afternoon's worth of work for 1 developer.

There is just nothing like it\n\nThe plot is very well written and story is told in such a brilliant non-linear fashion it is something that is to be admired. Not only are you searching for redemption but the sub-plots which focus on darker side of technology, what it means to be human, the guilt, reason, hunger for power, manipulation, humanity, conspiracy the game tells so many things which is just brilliant.\nIt's not just a game where cyberpunk genre is slapped, the events that happen are actually realistic and could happen in the future. Little details about how the technology is used and is implemented is very well done and clearly the developing team paid very close detail to the actual technology and how to implement it in a realistic fashion. Dialouges are great too.\n\nGameplay is very unique and excellently executed, variety of weapons, the way they are handled and used in different situations is excellent.\nThe way you choose to progress is bloody brilliant, you may choose the stealth approach or could go guns blazing, you could explore hidden paths and reach to your destination without going through so much trouble or you could simply do a combination of both. You can kill or just knock enemies down or simply just manage to avoid them or hack your way through with minimal combat. Objects could be used to hurt enemies or be used in puzzle solving. You can literally choose the way you want to play the game and every method is well executed.\nThere are augmentations which will enhance your combat, you can become super-strong or become invisible or know more about your enemies locations and so much more.\nControls take a while to get used to but it's okay because the gameplay is just so different naturally the controls will be different too. Also depending on how you are progressing, the outcomes can be different ultimately affecting everything that happens in the journey.\n\nThe game looks good, the art style is well done as it gives the dark distopian tone of the near future and enhances the atmosphere, the sounds are well done and the music which is all electronic just adds more to the vibe of the distopian future they wanted to create.\n\nOverall, a splendid game staying true to the spirit of previous games in the franchise as well as doing something different, it pays homage to it's predecessors as well as intoduces new people into the franchise. A casual gamer will love it and so will the hardcore one. It is just utter brriliance and a well executed game.","January 7","true","49.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

What a phenomenal game, and it sure did not disapoint my expectations either! Keep in mind, I have have only played the director's cut edition, so I will be basing my review on that version alone.\n\nLet's begin:\n\nAesthetics 8.25/10\nThe game looks very good, and the unique orangeish-hue scifi color is obviously present as well. The soundtrack was composed by a person that has receieved great appraisal, Micheal McCann. The music fits a very diverse set of locations, ranging from the iconic chinese jingles in Shanghai to futuristic stealthpumping action music. The game knows it's setting well, and shows it. The voice acting is great, but the lip-sync is kind of awkward and the animations for various npc's are reused over and over again, if you can overlook the usual shrugs by the females, then you'll be dandy.\n\nControls 9/10\nThe controls are near perfect for Deus Ex. Besides the usual flip flaps and glitchy control support, the game on keyboard and mouse is perfection.\n\nStory/Characters 9/10\nWords cannot describe the masterpiece that is the story, however the characters are somewhat bland, excluding Jensen. The story revolves around an augmented spec that works for a tech-company. As the game progresses, we see the various changes that have effected the world due to human augmentation. The game plays with the minds of the scientific illititerate, so as long as you have some standing knownledge of the original sequel to the game, you might get slightly lost.\n\nGameplay 8.50/10\nThe game is around 35-50 hours of gameplay. Not too long and not too short, a perfect margin. The game will try to force you to stick to stealth, however. As it does not condone nor reward you for killing people, you don't want to be a bad apple. The stealth system is so much fun, it's actually better than most stealth games actually! The hacking mini games are unique in the start of the game, but if you max out the hacking skill early on, it get's boring late-game. Lastly, the RPG system is a bit flawed, but  it does reward exploration. If you like to explore, you'll be treated to some augpoints.\n\nFinal Verdict 9.30/10\nThe game deserves the praise it is recieved. Buy the game, it's cheap and if you're into scifi and dystopian-esque societities, this is for you.\n\nTL;DR: Robo-Cop\n\n\n\n\n","May 16, 2014","true","53.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

It's the story, and the story's presentation. The original game introduced the villains quickly, and always kept them -- and their motivations -- just inside the shadows, giving players a delight in discovering the depths of their schemes. HR's villains are either so deep in the darkness that their motivations, even at the end of the game, are inscrutable and their methods obscure, while others are so front-and-centre that they border on the comical. Even the cast of protagonists flail about like marionettes, their strings being clumsily pulled to and fro by the writers with no idea of how to tell a compelling story.\n\nThe out-of-touch boss fights are the most direct merging of the bad story-telling with the poor gameplay, and the "alternative stealthy solutions" to those fights in this Director's Cut edition boil down to nothing more than some hackable turrets or sentries with which to gun down the bosses, clumsily added to levels without even bothering to update the minimap for the new level areas\n\nIt's true that you can choose to shoot, hack, subdue, or sneak, but the game clearly favours sneaking, hacking, and subduing, with massive XP loss if you fail to hack every terminal (even when you know the password!), search every vent, and knock out every guard. Do all this, and the XP rewards ensure you will be a veritable God by the endgame, invulnerable to the pathetic attempt at shock and horror in the final level.\n\nNo matter how you choose to play Adam Jensen in the game, he will never be as stupid or as incompetent as he is in the cutscenes, which serve to ham-handedly enforce idiotic plot twists. And whereas the original gave three interesting solutions to humanity's future, with different, equally valid reasons to select, presented by different, generally equally likeable characters, offering differing mission challenges, and brief, direct, and meaningful conclusions, this game gives us a choice of four buttons to press in the final room, followed by vague philosophical meandering to a vague montage that wouldn't look out of place on a YouTube conspiracy video.\n\nLong story short: The gameplay is disappointing and the story is not compelling. It's a mediocre ride at best, and does a disservice to the Deus Ex name.","January 5, 2014","false","30.2"," 27 of 42 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","27","42","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/afbg1/recommended/238010/","afbg1","ABG","http://steamcommunity.com/id/afbg1/","141 products in account",""Transhumanism (abbreviated as H+ or h+) is an international cultural and intellectual movement with the goal of fundamentally transforming the human condition by eventually developing and making widely available technologies to greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities."\n\nThe 3rd entry to the Deus Ex franchise, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a cyberpunk themed stealth RPG. Developed by Eidos Montreal, the original Deus Ex is considered one of the most influential games of all time, pioneering on player choice, RPG mechanics and stealth. With all this said, Human Revolution has quite a bit to live up to as part of the Deus Ex series. Prior knowledge to the Deus Ex series is not required to play Human Revolution, apart from a few nods and easter eggs to the original game, you can safely play Human Revolution without knowledge of the first. So how does Human Revolution stand on its own?\n\nSet in 2027, 25 years before the events of the first game, the world is on the brink of a human revolution. Augmentations, human enhancements that allow people to improve themselves through the use of cybernetic limbs, neuroenhancements bionic eyes. Humans are now able to improve themselves through augmentation technology, some simply using it to replace a lost leg or fading vision, while some augment themselves into super-humans, replacing their limbs with cybernetic ones, turning themselves into more machine than man. Multinational corporations now have more control over the people than their governments (sounds like the world today), from the rise of augmentation technology. But not all organizations support the notion of humanity reaching beyond their limits through augmentation technology.\n\nOne one side there are those who see augmentation as the next step for humanity, allowing mankind to break free of their natural limits and using augmentation as the next step for human evolution. On the other side are the "anti-aug" or "pro-human" groups, who fear the ethics of augmentation, and the power it can give to augmented individuals, believing humanity should never have that power. Deus Ex: Human Revolution has done an excellent job of presenting the augmentation debate into a coherent and believable story. The game presents many overarching themes, such as the ethics of transhumanism, human survival, poverty, the power organizations have over people, and most importantly, questioning what it means to be human. It can sound all pretentious on paper, but Human Revolution at no point feels like it is trying to be more than it is not. Do humans lose part of themselves when they replace their limbs with cybernetic prosthetics, even when it may give them a better life? Is a person that is more machine than man still a human being? The game asks these questions but does not give any answers, instead allowing the player to form their own opinion.\n\nThis cannot all have been done without the fantastic effort gone into the world building of Deus Ex. All characters you meet have something to say on the argument, whether they are for or against augmentation. You find newspapers scattered across the game, with stories ranging from anti-augmentation protests, a fully-augmented pop-star winning at an awards ceremony, the next games for the "National Enhanced Hockey League." You hear a husband and wife arguing with each other, upset that they no longer love each other because one had become augmented, less human in the others eyes. News reports coming from the television talk of U.N debates on whether to regulate augmentation. These are all such small details, but it makes the world of Deus Ex: Human Revolution so much more than just an open world to explore.\n\nYou play as Adam Jensen, a private security officer for Sarif Industries, one of the worlds leading biotech corporations. After an attack on the company, Jensen is severely injured, forced to go through augmentations throughout his entire body to survive. Throughout the game, you can upgrade your augments through XP, which is awarded for completing quests, eliminating enemies, successfully hacking an object, finding hidden paths and areas or sneaking through an entire area undetected. The progression system is extremely well done, with all augments being extremely different from the other. There are several "paths" in which augmentations are categorized, namely "combat," "stealth," "hacking," and "social." All of these offer different playstyles in which the player has the option of customizing as they please. Combat augments are as expected, allowing maximized armor, less weapon recoil. Stealth augments range from cloaking, to silent footsteps, to seeing enemies and objects through walls. Hacking augments allow players to hack doors, sentry turrents, cameras and robots, allowing players to find new hidden areas or potentially disabling/turning robots and turrents on the enemy. The social is the most interesting augment. and one that is extremely well done. Throughout the game, you can engage in "dialogue battles," and "boss conversations." With the social augments, these allow you to see the personality of the person (Alpha, Beta, Omega), and a psychological profile listing that persons psychological traits and personality, which give hints to how the person may react to certain dialogue options. Using the information given and paying attention to the reactions of the person, you are able to "win" these dialogue battles.\n\nLevel and art design is masterfully handled. You have several open hub areas, namely Detroit and Hengsha, where you can explore the city, get side-quests, find hidden areas and buy equipment from merchants. In both side-quests and the main story, you are given a free reign on how you wish to approach it and get from point A to B. All missions in the game have various direct and hidden routes, such as entering a guarded complex from the sewers below, approaching it straight from the front, or climbing the roof and entering from a neighboring building. This freedom allows all players, no matter what style of play they chose to make their own decisions on how to complete an objective, and one of the games best features. Art design in the game is aesthetically appropriate to the games cyberpunk theme. Both Detroit and Hengsha are filled by towering buildings with large electronic billboard advertisements, neon signs pointing to the nearest attractions, the slums and sewers below filled with the homeless and those who have chosen to reject augmentation. The black and gold hue of the game suits it well, being able to evoke the futuristic atmosphere of the game very well.\n\nDespite all this, there are a few flaws in Human Revolution that deserve mentioning. While the progression system is generally well done, it is a little imbalanced, favoring the "stealth-hacker." Throughout a level you can find pocket secretaries in drawers or hidden elsewhere, which often contain passcodes or passwords for computers in the level. However even with this information, the same result can be achieved by simply hacking into the computer or door, which can give both XP and cash/credits, while entering the passcode/password does not. Finding hidden paths and alternative routes to the objective is one of the main elements of the game and is one of the best, however it is unbalanced by the XP reward given by finding these areas. Finding a hidden area is always rewarded in giving 100-300 XP, a huge amount relative to the other alternatives. Lastly, the boss battles feel out of place, despite the Director's Cut allowing hacker oriented players to beat the bulletsponge bosses by hacking nearby computers to turn the robots against the enemy. That being said, these a minor aspects which do not detract from the larger game itself.\n\nDeus Ex: Human Revolution is one of the best games I have ever played. A must buy game for RPG, stealth and cyberpunk enthusiasts.","October 12, 2015","true","41.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Talk about "won over by a game"  or "missing out for too long".\nI did play the original Deus Ex wayyy back when, but for some reason I wasn't interested in the sequels, and didn't try them. And this one... I had heard good things about it, but for some reason, either some other game kept me busy, or I simply wasn't interested.\nUntil now. Boy, did I miss out.\n\nStory\n\nHR is IMO quite in the spirit of the original DE... there is stealth, but you can also try to fight openly. There are different methods of solving a situation, there are secrets, and...there is a great storyline.\nIndeed, the story is quite fascinating, and even though The Fall sucked, you might wanna consider reading "The Icarus Effect", a novel that is kinda set in between The Fall and HR (no spoilers though!)\n\nAnyway, so the story is rather deep, and there is a strong Mass Effect vibe to it all. You get sucked into it, and your answers in conversations do make a difference. If you want to, you can enhance yourself to be able to "read" people and manipulate them.\n\nStealth\n\nWhich leads me to one of the coolest parts about the game - the stealth approach. Stealth in this game works great, and it is so satisfying to sneak through a large area, dodging all enemies, not alerting them. If you fail, you can still fight openly or try to get away, so it's not as frustrating unless you really want to avoid being detected or killing anyone... if you wanna do that, it can be quite challening, but o so satisfying once you nail it.\n\nThe augmentations can be very helpful, allowing you to fall from great heights, find alternative routes or even becoming invisible for a short time.\n\nThe stealth-system, to me, was insanely fun. You can try to play this Rambo-Style, and I think that can be fun too, as the cover-system works well (IMO even better than in the more recent The Division), but to me, it was all about being a ghost.\n\nThe Director's Cut makes quite a difference - because the boss battles now have new methods of winning them. In the past, before the DC, if you were fully specced and equipped for stealth, the boss fights felt pretty frustrating and not like fun. I mean, you spend 90% of the game trying to be sneaky, and then have to do an open fire-fight with a strong boss?\nEach boss has a method you can use if you are more into stealth or using tools (again, no spoilers). It doesn't make them totally trivial, as using those methods still can be tricky or risky. With the first boss, I didn't find the "stealth method" at first, and felt totally put off by that fight, until I experimented and suddenly found... again, no spoilers.\n\nExploring and always looking for alternate routes (vents) will allow you to avoid most fights.\n\nGameplay\n\nControls work great (used a controller), but I did switch to a mouse for hacking. Hacking is a mini-game which is essential for the game, as it unlocks doors, shuts down security traps, unlocks secrets etc. Fortunately, it isn't that difficult (again, I found doing this with a mouse quicker and easier, compared to the controller), unless you wanna pick up special bonusses you get from nodes in the hacking grid... it's your choice.\n\nI recommend to save often, and use the quicksave (F5) a lot. If things go wrong, reload and retry.\n\nThe AI is not incredibly smart, but it's decent, and I had fun taking the guys out with the stun gun.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics ARE showing the age of the game a bit, but they're still decent and add a lot to the atmosphere.\n\nMusic:\nJust great, nuff said.\n\nPros:\n- Fun stealth system\n- Lots of optional methods to solve situations\n- Enhancements\n- Storyline/writing\n- The dialogue game\n- Alternate methods for bosses, especially the "stealth solutions" added in the DC\n-  Challenging, depending on your difficulty settings and your own goals (Non-lethal, stealth etc)\n- Lots of optional secrets and "lore"\n- Atmosphere\n- Good performance even on older systems\n\nCons:\n- Showing it's age a bit\n- A lot of running forth and back on rather small maps\n- Clunky management of the small inventory imo\n- If you pick up a weapon you already have, you only get the ammo. No way to pick up the wep and sell it for profit. Money isn't all tjhat essential, but allows you to buy more skillpoints, so if you're a packrat, this fact and the small inventory might be a downer\n\nVerdict:\nAt full prize, 8.5 of 10, at anything between 5-10 EUR (sale) I give it a 9-9.5. Yes, it's showing its age and has some flaws, but the stealth, the story, atmosphere and protagonist make up for all of that IMO. It's really really good, and if you can't get into the much older DE because it feels a bit too old school, please consider giving this one a try. I love it.","April 3","true","16.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/238010/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","Well-made remix of the original Deus Ex, presenting beautifully crafted backstory and solid, entertaining gameplay. It is wise, it is made of nothing but best efforts and good intentions. A brilliant of the game. I see truth in every sane positive review, in every high mark that title got. Superb stuff, which is worth every penny.\n\nYet, I’m not satisfied with it. For some reason, I feel that game is too tied to the past, to be something I call cyberpunk.\n\nDeus Ex Human Revolution has everything I could only ask from cyberpunk game. It calls itself so. But that’s a lie. Not completely, of course. You know, the standard definition for cyberpunk sounds like “Hi tech. Low life”, and that’s that we see a plenty in our game. But I’ve got another quote for you, from our precious W. Gibson: “The world has never had so many moving particles and so few labels for them”.\nI think the label “cyberpunk” is not fitting Deus Ex HR completely, because it is way too caring about what’s going on, in a global meaning. It is way too conscious for an action game. And it is praising a human life so high, that it makes me sick sometimes. In Hengsha events, to be precise. And even worse – in that embedded, crushed into the flesh of the original game, DLC Missed Link. I know I’m facing the bad guys, who are not caring about human lives at all. Why should I care for their lives? I don’t know. But all those bonuses to Exp points, all those achievements like Pacifist or Factory Zero, all the given pre-history of my protagonist Adam Jensen, insisting I should leave them be. And that leaves a mark.\n\nOkay, I know that does not convince you about my point. Have another: the creators of Deus Ex HR were too attached to the original Deus Ex of the year 2000, to create really new game. I understand them, surely: were they too innovative, and all those fans would destroy a game’s name in the media, made a lower metacritic score, and that would be a disaster, of course. But again, cutting off  something new and of hi tech because someone cares and could dislike you – does it sounds cyberpunk to you? For me, it’s  plain and pure conservatism there.\n\nSo many good things in this game:\n\n1) brilliant level design, there you always have the choice of routes, for every tactic you would like, would that be stealth, assault, some kind of “social engineering”, or mix of those.\n\n2) Delightful hacking mini game and all interactions with computers in general. It is certainly quite natural and adding much of context in the game. Wish we had something like that in the new Shadowrun series...\n\n3) Speaking of context, I also enjoyed the level of detail through all the game. For example, when I suddenly decided to kill some merks on my second walkthrough, I couldn’t find their leader later in the game. Because he was expecting me, for one, and was feared that I won’t spare him, secondly. Damn right he was! Funny thing was  that I remember in my first trip when I knocked him off, I was deciding, whether to kill him, or leave him be… and obeyed the Pacifist rule, to get an achievement.\n\n4) Not only every situation in the game could be untied in various styles. There are some options which I believe was not even predicted by the designers! Like: there are two guards and turret. I can crouch behind guards, but if I want to deal with them, to have clear backside, I need to deal with turret first. I can switch it off, but guards will notice me doing so. I can sneak behind the turret and shove her into a corner, where it can’t be a problem anymore. But once I just picked that turret and threw it into the guards. And knocked them both by that throw! Pure luck, I guess.\n\n5) Music is nice, I still have some of soundtrack in my playlist. Voicing is gorgeous, can’t wish for better. All the visuals part is good, even if some details are look exactly like in the first Deus Ex.\n\nBads list is small:\n\n1) Even with all good effort on details, there are some very generic elements which I can’t tolerate, like the looks of offices, office decks and, worst of all, damned faxes everywhere! Oh, why?\n\n2) Implementation of the “Missing Link” dlc in the middle of the base game is furies me. I really don’t think this was a good idea, and good implementation. I like that dlc the way it was. It reminds me of the Sleeping Dogs Definitive edition, where they messed all the fun both from the game AND dlc stuff by implementing it.\n\n3) That game takes too much effort “to make it right”, in Pacifist way. It is so persistent with that “what’s right” thing, even (especially) in the endings… I can’t bear it. The game supposed to be multiplexed, fit every approach… but no, all that freedom of choice is something of illusion. I know people who like Dishonored more, for their choices make a bigger difference in the end. Me? I prefer Alpha Protocol.\n\nOverall mark 8.99/10, for the amount of work, and with handsel to the next game, which, as I knew already, will do better.\n\nNB: check this article: http://ludo.mwclarkson.com/2011/10/adam-jensen-dmpd/","August 26, 2015","true","208.9"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","3"

(See the bottom of this review for a TL;DR)\n\nSo, I will attempt to give as unbiased an opinion of this game as I can, by category to make it easier.\n\nFirst is the gameplay: I have to say that the gameplay is good in the fact that is offers you an array of options to choose from with any given situation, you can either go in all guns blazing, or go sneaking around all stealthy, or find a balance between those 2 styles. I liked the fact it gave you the freedom in this regard. However, to be honest, I just didn't really find the combat particularly fun, I'm not quite sure why, perhaps it was the whole switching out between first and third person shooters that did it. Unlike other games, I never really felt like a badass while taking bad guys down, and I felt the combat is a little unforgiving (I was playing on normal difficulty) but given that stealth is an option that is acceptable because otherwise the stealth approach would be a little less inviting. In terms of how the stealth mechanics play out, I thought they were quite well executed, when you keep your wits about you, you can slowly, but surely make your way past pretty large groups of bad guys, but if you trip up you may find yourself forced into a fire-fight, but that is how a stealth game should be, so that is not a problem. Additionally, I thought the hacking mini-game was extremely well done, unlike many hacking mini-games (such as Mass Effect 1 or 2) it is not tedious and boring and you enter into it thinking "uh...better hack this damn terminal..." The hacking mini-game in Deus Ex requires some planning, strategy and quick thinking, the hacking mechanic was masterfully implemented.\n\nPlayer Progression: Player progression is pretty good in this game, without going into any spoilers, you get xp points in which you can upgrade both passive, and active abilities at a reasonably regular basis, you can also buy xp for credits at certain stores. the game has a pretty extensive amount of upgrades and I think you would be hard pressed to upgrade all your abilities by the end of the game, this is good because it forces you to make decisions on prioritising upgrades for what your play-style is, for example: do I upgrade my stealth vision or do I give myself more armour? However, the amount of xp you get is not too prohibitive, you don't get so little xp you are forced to do go down one tree and you are stuck there, you can branch out over several ability trees to suit your style, just not all of them. The game seems to have plenty of weapons and items, and introduces them at a rather nice pace, you don't get 1/3rd of the way through the game and find you have already unlocked all the guns like some games, you get new guns right up until the end. In terms of purchasing equipment, it's a pretty standard RPG kind of set up; you do quests, loot various things, sell items off at stores, you get credits for it, you can then buy various upgrades, ammo and weapons at stores. Stores...*shudder* i'll open that bag of worms later in thie review.\n\nInterface and Navigation: This games interface is quite nice, it has a nice high-tech feel to it and is rather well done, apart from one aspect, Navigation. The navigation in this game is horrible, although you have a map, it is never really useful for telling you where to go, the map is made up of un-detailed blocks that don't show you anything of the terrain or buildings in the area, so you don't know where to go to get to where the quest marker is. Remember that can of worms about shops I mentioned earlier? yea, here it is, sure, this game has shops, but they are NEVER marked on your map, you can only find them by remembering where they are, and given how useless the map is, and how the city hubs all look quite similar, it's damn tricky to remember, it also gives you no indicators as to where other points of interest are, such as your apartment.\n\nSound design and soundtrack: I know not everyone is as concerned with these two things as I am, but for those few who are; the actual sounds in this games sound design seemed pretty good, but they always seemed somewhat delayed by a few miliseconds, like, I would fire my gun, but it didn't quite match up with the muzzle flashes, perhaps it was just my imagination, or perhaps not. The soundtrack for this game served its purpose, it created the desired atmosphere, so I guess thats a plus, but it didn't really do much more than that. The soundtrack isn't bad but don't expect any amazingly epic soundtrack orchestrated moments.\n\nPlot: Now, plot is a big part of this game. It's hard for me to be to critical of this games plot because, I can't really find anything wrong with it...but at the same time, I just didn't really find it all that engaging. It has everything one wants from a plot, a good concept, decent lore and an interesting world in which it is based in, some good plot twists, revelations...but...it just never seemed to get me particularly engaged in it, sure, there were a few moments where I was like :o but only a few. In all truth though, now that I think of it, there isn't anything wrong with the plot, but the characters. The characters all seems so two-dimensional, even the character you play as seems like he has no personality at all, he just seems like a bit of a robot, I guess, perhaps if that's how you wan't your character to be thats great, but I don't. I personally don't like his voice actor, he seems like he's trying to do some kind of forced batman voice most of the time, and he never shows any expression or emotion in his voice, there was only one point in the game where the character actually had any kind of decent voice acting. As for the other characters, the only one I came remotely attached to was the chick who flys you around in a helicopter, at least she had a little bit of personality. As for villains, they seem a little basic and somewhat generic for villains, theres nothing about them that really makes you think "gee...that guy actually has a point?...is he/she really the villain I have been led to believe?" Perhaps I have just been spoiled by the characters from games like Mass Effect and Starcraft II, but I just didn't really connect with any of them.\n\nGraphics: For a 2011 game, they seem about what you would expect, nothing really good or bad about them.\n\nBugs/Issues: I did have issues with my screen flickering white until I turned the game to direct X 9 rather than using 11, which is somewhat unfortunate because I would have liked to get the benefits of using DX11. I also got low frame-rates in few-second bursts every now and then, and my system can more than handle this game. I have a hunch that you probably are safe from the screen flickering issue on an AMD graphics card, given that this game seems to be optimized for it, but it should still run fine on any Nvidia card.\n\nAll in all (A TL;DR/Summary): This is a decent game with a few different gameplay styles to choose from, it has pretty standard and character progression that is neat in the fact that it forces you to chose a play-style. it has pretty standard sound design and soundtrack. It has a nice interface but has terrible navigation. It has a very interesting world in which it is based and an intruiging plot, but is let down by rather two-dimensional characters.\n\nMy final verdict: Do I recommend this game? well...it honestly depends on the price, and the full $19.99 listed here, I would have to say no, however If it is on special, say $10.00 or under It might be worth picking up, if nothing more I will keep you occupied for a good 20-30 hours.\n\nHopefully you find this review useful :)","November 8, 2014","false","26.3"," 127 of 231 people (55%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","55","127","231","7","14"

It became an instand classic and a must play, and frankly- quite deservengly so.With that being said, it still has some minor issues.\n\nHR is a prequel to the first Deus Ex, taking place 25 years before the first title of the series. The setting probably, is the strongest part of the game: it's art direction, music, visual representation and overall style are simply breathtaking. It is worth playing, simply to experience all of it.\n\nThe gameplay is reminiscent of the first Deus Ex with 2 significant changes:\n\n1.Chest hight walls\nYes, I am afraid that trends of modern gaming didn't pass HR completely by, so get ready to shoot people from behind cover. While shooter part is diminished by ever present chest hight cover, the stealth part is actually enhanced- it is extremely convenient to be able to see behind corners, and plan your approach accordingly.\n\n2.Level design\nWhile Deus Ex provided HUGE open ended areas, with a lot of freedom, HR' s levels look more like corridors. We are still able to choose from a verity of approaches, (vents, breakable walls, sewers and so on), but the illusion of freedom of movement has been diminished somewhat. We are still however have an absolute freedom in game play aspect of problem solving: stealth or  direct approach, lethal or non lethal, guns or melee  takedowns.\n\nThe story  itself I will break into 3 parts: plot, setting, and  philosophical context.\n\n1.The setting.\nSimply amazing. Frighteningly realistic, it menages to build a bridge between our reality and the bleak  dystopian future of the first Deus Ex. Geo-political disputes, ethically bankrupt  corporations, shadow governments and rampant abuse of technology create a world almost as believable as it is repulsive.\n\n2.Philosophical context\nHR's main focus is on  transhumanism and the plethora of questions around it: The ethics of human augmentations, self controlled human evolution and the line between the man and the machine.\n\n3.The plot\nThe weakest link in HR. While the plot itself is serviceable, characters don't  have arks, motivations are lacking, and  by the end the plot runs out of steam, disconnecting you from the story and characters completely.\n\nThe missing Link DLC included in the director's cut provides about 2 hours of gameplay and indeed  enriches the story, but itself consists of nothing but straight corridors with even less freedom to explore.\n\nIn conclusion: A masterpiece. Highly recommended.","May 11","true","46.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Mainly unsatisfied with the 'Missing Link' DLC being completly seperated from the main game, I looked forward for this complete package.\n\nWith the integration of the 'Missing Link' DLC and some other small Pre-Purchase DLCs into the main game this would just have been a simple 'GOTY edition', but you get a bit more. Beside some better facial animations and the redsigned Boss fights you also get a full developer comentary for the whole game.\n\nThis changes and additions combined with a big standard discount for owners of the original version (and 'Missing Link' DLC) on Steam make this a must have for everyone who plan to play this game again.\n\nTo the game itself is not really much to say. The setting, the visual style and the sound/music are wonderful and make the world believable. The only negative point for me is the not real existant free decision in terms of ways to solve the problems/missions in the game (the stealth and hacking way gives you way more exp points).

Acting as a prequel to the first game in the series and taking obvious inspiration from classic cyberpunk movies like RoboCop, you play as ex-SWAT Adam Jensen who ends up unraveling a conspiracy behind the death of a team of scientists that were on the brink of revealing one of the biggest breakthroughs in science yet, one that could potentially merge man and machine for good. Though little does he know that his trip down the proverbial rabbithole has barely begun.\n\nThe game is very much a seamless blend of stealth and action and like the first game leaves how you play the game entirely up to the player. You can sneak your way in, you can hack your way in or hell, grab a gun and kill everyone in your path. It's all up to you.\n\nI highly recommend checking out the Director's Cut if you're a big fan of Human Revolution or haven't played it yet. The added developer commentary, DLC integration, and not to mention the improved boss fights makes this the definitive version of the game in my opinion. The boss fights was one of the biggest gripes with the game and this version adds far more tactical options to them for players who use different playstyles. It also helps that the graphics look far better in this version since the yellow filter is more toned down allowing for more colour variation. I also wanna mention the addition of a New Game+ mode that makes replaying the game on harder difficulties a bit more fun and achievable.","June 27, 2014","true","233.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Human Revolution takes place in 2027 and is a prequel to the original Deus Ex.  Playing the original is not required at all to understand the story, but I do suggest playing it simply because its a great game.  The story of Deus Ex: Human Revolution tackles the subject of Transhumanism in a way that really makes you think.  The subject matter is complex and is an issue that we will likely face in the not to distant future.  The gameplay is really solid but there is a lot of room for improvement.  The game gives you plenty of tools and lets you approach a situation however you like.  However the game favors certain types of play styles more than others.  Playing stealthy and taking everyone out non-lethally will give you the most XP, which means you can get more upgrades.  You can upgrade Jensen with praxis kits.  You get these praxis kits by getting enough XP or buy buying them in clinics.  There's plenty of stuff to upgrade but some of the augments you get are pretty useless.  For example "Smart Vision" allows you to see through walls.  Sounds pretty useful right?  It would be but the game has a Metal Gear Solid Style radar that lets you see enemies and their field of vision(with an upgrade) so it's actually pretty useless.  The only problem I had with the original HR was the boss fights.  Luckily the Boss fights have been fixed to an extent in the Directors Cut.  The PC port is good, no real problems except that tessellation can cause faces to be covered in white and black dots.\n\nScore: 9/10","October 24, 2014","true","16.0"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","14","21","0","0"

It's funny because I got this game for the xbox from Eidos themselves, my dad worked in the anti-piract business and I never beat it on there. Then, I bought the game again, for the PC, never beat it, AND then I bought the Director's Cut and I waited a whole 8 months to play it, and I recently beat it\n\nDeus Ex, is about a man named Adam Jensen, he's an ex-swat member, who is now a security guard for a big, augmentation corperation called Sarif Industries. In his line of work, he has two co-workers, Megan Reed, a scientist that has made a breakthrough in augmentations and Francis Pritchard, a computer person or whatever. Then, Sarif Industries was attacked by augmented spec ops, who kidnapped Megan and 4 other scientists. You were trying to save her, but in the process, you get gravely injured and have to get augmentations. After you get them, your mission is to find out what happened to Megan and her team and get them back.\n\nThis game was crafted so well, the gameplay was fluid, a FPS shooter mixed with an RPG styled level up system. You put points into augments to upgrade and make better and upgrade the ones that better suit your play style. Stealth or go head on. Mine was going head on, I hate stealth. This game had a various amount of weapons, grenades, abilities, etc. All were different in their own ways. The quest system was quite, course directed, besides the one or two side missions in each mission location. The interaction with people was fun, you could get information out of them or you could just go up to them and knock them out. I like doing that.\n\nThe DLC, Missing Link, comes with the Director's Cut, incorperated into the game, was absolutely horrible and was not needed. Who wants to know about the time he got all his augments stripped from him and he has to fight his way to get them back. It was really boring, a lot of running back and forth, and not to mention all the damn biometric scanners. I wish I could have chosen to play the DLC at the end. But, putting it, into the story, made somewhat of a difference. It does work well with the story, but honestly it wasn't what I was looking for in a Deus Ex DLC.\n\nI know this is a shorter review than normal but, I'm not really feeling well, but this game was a masterpiece, this is the only Deus Ex game I've ever played, but I plan to play The Invisible Wars. But, for now, I loved this game, I can't believe I never finished it. I beat the game in about 15 hours, plus watched all the endings. So I give this game a 9.5/10 :D","August 4, 2014","true","15.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dyldag47/recommended/238010/","dyldag47","Double D","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dyldag47/","453 products in account","Deus Ex: Human Revolution is set in one of my favourite universe: the Cyberpunk universe, set in a near future where all is black and there is no more hope. Even if a lot of games use that universe, Deus Ex: Human revolution makes it look fresh and new. And this time you play as an overpowered Cyborg ex SWAT with bionic arms with bombs and swords in them!\n\nThe story is set before the original Deus Ex, and just like his predecessor, Deus Ex: Human Revolution has an addicting story and you will immerse yourself in after only a few minutes of gameplay (at least for me). The game also has really good soundtracks that perfectly fits in the game.\n\nThere are a multitude of lethal and non-lethal guns, rifle, shotguns, pistols etc.. that looks unique and different, and almost all the weapons can be upgraded with weapon mods. there is also a multitude of explosive weaponry such as RPGs, grenade launchers, grenades and remote explosives. Or you can go with the takedowns, which allows you to kill or knock out an enemy when close to them. And you can also hide their bodies afterwards.\n\nThere is also a small hacking mini-game which allows the character to hack multiple electronic items such as keypads and computers. There is also a persuasion mini-game which allows the character to persuade other characters to do special favors which can unlock other side missions. The mini-game are fun to do and are not overused.\n\nThe game is an action based game mixed with stealth with multiple choices of mission completion. The game takes about 20h to complete and there are multiple side quest at certain points in the game. The missions are all unique and mixed with multiple choices of gameplay which adds variation to the game.\n\nThere are multiple augmentations for the character to acquire, almost all of them are varied and creative. per example, you have one that allows your character to see through walls, or another one that allows you to deploy multiple small bombs that instantly kills all the enemies around you which make you feel like a total badass.\n\nThe game also has a lot of Unique NPCs, bosses and enemies to encounter all included with Robots and Cyborgs.\n\nWith the Director's Cut, the game now has a New Game+, Which allows the character to carry over his augmentations in a new game, which is really awesome. The Director's Cut also added the DLC: The Missing Link in the game instead of making a separate game like in the original Deus Ex: Human Revolution, which makes it feel more natural. There is also multiple small additions and tweaks added in the game.\n\nHowever the game has its flaws, first of all, the character isn't that powerful at the beginning of the game. The new body of the character uses energy, so some equipment that the character has such as the invisibility cloak, the advance vision or the sound suppressor will use energy, which makes sense, and the character can regain energy over time or by eating food or vitamins, but the thing is that energy is also used when doing a takedown, so your going to end up waiting 30 second for your energy to fill up just because you punched a guy in the face to knock him out, which is kind of pathetic for a Cyborg ex SWAT. But the character can acquire augmentations that will give him more energy and that will make the energy fill up faster, which allows him to do multiple takedowns before using all of the energy available.\n\nThe game has no Multiplayer, which would have been awesome, but the game makes it up with its awesome Singleplayer.\n\nAlso, any save of the original Deus Ex: Human Revolution won't carry to the director's Cut version. Forcing you to start alll over again.\n\nYou will need to buy the game again if you already bought the original Deus Ex: Human Revolution once in order to have all the bonuses that the Director's Cut offers, so you are going to end up with the original game, the separate DLC, and the Director's Cut version with the game and the DLC combined, which is kind of pointless.\n\nThe Goods:\n+ You're a Cyborg, nothing more to say!\n+ Unique and creative augmentations for your character.\n+ Now with New Game plus, which allows the character to carry his augmentations to a new game.\n+ Improved textures over the original Deus Ex: Human Revolution\n+ Now with the developer commentaries.\n+ Reworked bosses over the original Deus Ex: Human Revolution.\n+ Addictive storyline.\n+ Good soundtrack\n+ Fun and varied missions.\n+ Unique and different NPCs and enemies.\n\nThe bads:\n- Loses energy when doing takedowns.\n- End up with three games if you already bought the original one and the separated DLC.\n- No multiplayer.\n- Any save of the original Deus Ex: Human Revolution won't carry to the director's Cut version.\n\nI recommend it if you're a fan of the Cyberpunk universe, and the action stealth type of game if you haven't already bought the original one with the separated DLC, or if you simply want the small additions and tweaks that the Director's Cut version offers.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n9/10.\nMust Own!","April 8, 2014","true","20.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saitorr/recommended/238010/","saitorr","SaiTorr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saitorr/","105 products in account","Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a story-driven action adventure RPG, taking place in a cyberpunk future ruled by scientific breakthroughs and corporate greed. You play as Adam Jenson, an ex-cop turned fully-augmented head of security for one of the worldwide leading companies in technological advancement, Sarif Industries. You'll travel the globe, sneak into top-secret enemy facilities, and eventually unearth a conspiracy hidden to the public eye. Needless to say, the story of Human Revolution is very deep; the game deals heavily with themes regarding humanity, freedom, and limitation, and has you questioning the morality of scientific advancement in post-modern society. While it takes a while to set up an engaging story, the game keeps you playing based simply on its fascinating vision of the not-too-far-off future. The choices you encounter along the way effect the story in meaninful ways as well. In short, Human Revolution may not feature the most emotionally compelling story ever in a video game, but easily one of the most intriguing.\n\nHuman Revolution can be completed in two differing ways; by sneaking past all your enemies stealthily, or going guns-blazing into every encounter. Because the level design is incredibly well done, both approaches are commendable. I usually prefer the stealthy approach, but only because it's more rewarding and has more features available. As you level up, you'll earn Praxis Kits, which  upgrade your augmentations. Let me just say that no game I've played has offered as many useful upgrades as are available here. The game also has a hacking element, which is basically a simple minigame. However, hacking also acts as one of the unsung approaches of Human Revolution; you can disable cameras, gain access to secret files, and even turn programmed turrets on your enemies. Enemy AI as well is usually pretty intelligent. Any time that I think I've been spotted while stealthing, enemies will most definitely have spotted me. Overall, the gameplay here is fairly well thought-out and challenging.\n\nOverall, Deus Ex is the cyberpunk game that I've always wanted, but never had the chance to play. While it's definitely built as a stealth title, players used to the combat approach will still have a fun time. The soundtrack might I add is also amazingly good. On a final note, the Director's Cut merely includes a DLC expansion into the main story, adding about an hour or two of additional gameplay, though it's still worth it. If you're into conspiracy-heavy plots, cyberpunk settings, or just a well-built stealth game, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is the ideal game for you.\n\n9/10 - Worth it at current asking price (Definitely get during a sale of you're not too sure how you'll enjoy the game).","August 18, 2015","true","45.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","1"

They've changed up the boss fights a bit so hackers and other nondirect combat characters have a way of winning (although there are still no non-lethal methods to deal with these bosses)\n\nThe rumors that the devs restored a lot of cut content such as the Montreal and India hubs is simply not true, the only "new" game content is the merging of the missing link into the main game, so it's not a separate thing you run anymore. Your equipment will carry over after you finish, as well. Once you beat the game, there is a new game + mode that lets you keep all your augments (but I don't think there is any additional difficulty beyond what you choose, as I haven't ran into any yet)\n\nOverall I feel like it's a good buy and a bit of an improvement over the original, despite these fixes being something that could have just been released in a patch.","December 31, 2013","true","33.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

So what's new? To be perfectly honest, not very much. This is pretty much the same game we got then. I can only really list 3 notable changes: A slight alteration in the look of the game so it is less "yellow" than before, some new (mostly hacking related) options for the first 3 boss fights (the final one is still the same as before), and the merging of DXHR with it's DLC Missing Link. That's it. The boss fight one is probably the most notable, but truth be told since anyone with a brain maxes out their hacking skill very early on, this makes the boss fights alot easier since you can get turrets and robots to join in and lay on extra firepower. Namir in particular was hit by this because I got two robots to blow him away. A fight I used to have some difficulty with I breezed through with no trouble whatsoever. And yes, I was playing on Hard.\n\nThere's also new game plus, but i've not checked that out yet. From what i've heard though, it simply lets you carry on your augments into a new game. As if you need to be more overpowered...\n\nSo yeah. Not very different. The boss change is sorta nice, but that's just about it. If it wasn't for the fact that the base game is damn good as is, this wouldn't get a recommendation from me.\n\nBut it's still good and still fun.

This is more a stealth action shooter with RPG elements. Decisions you make WILL influence how you have to go about things but the entire game doesn't rely on it. You will pretty much get to the same points as you would have done, it just about how you get there.\n\nGame-play is a great mix of stealth and action, with a large range of weapons, both lethal and non-lethal. The game offers many strategies you can follow in order to defeat enemies, you can either go in guns-blazing, which wastes really great stealth mechanics which are some of the best aspects of the game, or you can sneak pass or sneak up on enemies. The latter is much more fun, as the game rewards you for dealing with a situation with discretion (e.g. non-lethal, stealth), where as just shooting everyone up can actually prove quite difficult.\n\nThe visuals and soundtrack are beyond amazing, it’s so rare now-a-days to find a game with a truly unique style and atmosphere that flows throughout the entire game.\n\nIf there is one area where this game falls slightly short, it’s the mechanics. On the whole, there decent, guard move where they are supposed to move, all fine. But the A.I can act a little dodgy, with enemies not noticing quite obvious movements, but it rarely crops up when playing the game and doesn’t tend to affect the stealth system at all. The gun mechanics are also somewhat clunky, but they are fine after you get used to them.\n\nThe story is great, following the life of Adam Jensen, Sarif Head of Security, after an incident at their HQ. Jensen is effectively killed in the attack but is “saved” by his boss, David Sarif, by being pumped full of power augments, some necessary to his survival... some not so much. I’ll leave it there so not to spoil anything, but if you’ve played the original Deus Ex games you’ll notice a number of links.\n\nA word of warning though, the Director's Cut Edition which solved perhaps the only real problem with this title, the boss battles, does up the specs and will require a better system than the original. Don't let that put you off though, you can always just drop the graphics a bit when you load up and you should be fine. There have also been a few reports of slight stuttering on the Director's Cut version (which I think steam forces you to buy now) but many fixes are available online, all of which helped me. [EDIT: These issues appear to have been patched out, but again, many fixes also exist online]\n\nIf worse comes to worst and you are worried about if this will run on your specs, you can always pick up a hard copy of the original which is still excellent.","February 23, 2014","true","47.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

And explains very much how the game was developed. Which difficulties and such.\n\nAnd you ALSO get "Developer Commentaries" like in the games from "Valve". You can optionally activate them in the options. So in the game world are now the commentaries and you can listen to them.\n\nDeus Ex: Human Revolution gives you nearly always a chance how to handle situations. You can kill everyone, you can stun them or you sneak. And in dialogues you have also chances how to react, angry, nice... like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Also how you handle some missions can affect the line of the story, not completly but some dialogues and such are changing.\n\nIt's a RPG game with a cyberpunk setting. The RPG aspect is really great. Besides your inventory you also have "Augmentations" which gives you bonuses, like you don't make any noise when you walk, or you are invisible for a few secs, knocking 2 enemies unconscious instead of only 1, you can hack more computers and security systems, jump heigher, sprint longer and much much more.\n\nBut you don't have all these upgrades from the start, you need to earn them with "Praxispoints" you get them if you search the enviroment for "Praxiskits" or when you have enough XP.\n\nYou get XP when you kill an enemie, knock him unconscious or just exploring the enviroment, as well when you complete mission targets.\n\nThere is no "Level" system like in other RPG games, also the XP limit you need to earn an another praxis point is always constant.\n\nAnyway, one of the greatest games i ever played. Just buy it and play it. I currently playing it for a second time through, there is much to explore and it still makes fun, until now i played 37 hours. Really even when you straight run through it you need a minimum of like 12-14 hours.","February 22, 2014","true","66.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

Так называемое "Недостающее звено" было благополучно портировано и стало "Достающим звеном". Кто-то говорит что был убран золотой фильтр, лично я этого особо не заметил.

Да, сие действительно есть, теперь нельзя нагло выглянуть на мгновение, чтобы враг не встревожился, а в особых случаях не "спалил", ну если только он на вас не смотрит.

It revolutionized gaming as a whole especially FPS games and action RPG's. Naturally when I came into Deus Ex Human Revolution(which will now be referred to as DXHR because it's just way easier) I had a lot of expections and I'm happy to tell you all that the game delivered! The game takes an "have it your way" style approach with the diverse skill tree it gives you which is basically activating your cyborg augmentations(I get to that once I get to the story)giving you many challenging situations and even more ways to complete them. Are you the kind of guy who likes to go into battle guns blazing? Well then you should pick up the dermal armor and recoil reduce upgrades! Perhaps you would rather take a stealth approach, or you just want to hack a few security turrets to kill off your enemies for you, or even just punch a whole in a wall or climb through an airduct to avoid confrontation all together. This is one of the games biggest strenghts and what makes it all the more better is the fact that the developers put a ton of thought into level design and teach you the rules of the game very well that if you can think of a way to overcome obstacles there is a %99.99 chance that it could work should you execute your plan effectivley. Now right now I'm sure any of you who haven't played the game are drawing comparisons to another great "have it your way" kind of game, Skyrim. Well the key difference is that Skyrim focuses more on where you want to explore(it is open world after all) but doesn't provide to extreme variety in play styles or how you choose to play that kind of style. What I mean is that in DXHR you can be a very stealth oriented player, but not be confined to that style of play because the skill tree is very friendly to players and allows you easy access to the basic skills required for any play style. This even carries over to the boss battles,unfortunatley non directors cut players will be very limited when it comes to how you take down a boss. Rather sadly though this doesn't mean the boss abttles are great. They are by no means bad or terrible, but they can be a little, how you say, confining. As I said before the Directors cut gives you more options when it comes to battleing bosses. By that I mean it gives you 1 more option when in most other scenarios there are several options to take down the baddies. Not to mention I found the boss battles to be boring and kind of pointless other than being used for the story of course. I think I've spent enough time on gameplay at this point, how about we turn our attention to story?\nDXHR packs an impressive story about Adam Jensen, Head of security for the BioAugmentation company Sarif Industries who used to be S.W.A.T but quit after being given a questionable order. He soon finds Sarif under attack by heavily augmented mercenaries who leave him for dead after brutally attacking him and scientist in one of Sarifs labs. He miracously survived at the cost of getting heavily augmented over the course of about 6 months I believe. This gives him access to every upgrade in the game, but his body needed time to naturally turn them one one at a time unlocking praxis points to spend on said augmentations as you gain expierence by completing quest, killing enemies ect. From here you follow several leads to find the mercenaries and where they fit in the bigger picture which takes you to places like, Detroit, China, and Montreal to name a few. There are also a lot of moral decisions to make through the story especially at the end giving you three tough options to choose between. Another nifty feature is conversations with branching dialouge options that actually have an effect on the game. For example early on in the game you are tasked with getting to a morgue in the local precicnt. You have the option of sneaking in, killing everyone(that strategy is not reccomended), or you can just talk the guard out to have him let you in. That's what I love about this game. It does so many interesting things with its gameplay that affect the story and vice versa. It makes the game unique and helps it to stand out from other games. In the end DXHR packs an impressive story into the mix too, but unfortunatley it doesn't show us the worts of it. When we hear about all of this gross things like harvesters who kidnap people to strip them of their augments and sell them we don't see that. It should have followed Blade Runners example and shown us everything. The last comment was made by Angry Joe in his review and I drew to the same conclusion and whole heartedly agree with what he said. Thankfully thought that is the only negative when it comes to the story.\nAs far is presentation goes the game looks and sounds fantastic. The soundtrack fits the futuristic theme quite well, the color palette consist mostly of gold and black, and the sound design in general all come together and fantastically emersed me into the games world. One small gripe I have with the graphics though is that facial animations are very stiff which doesn't do much for the wonderful looking game. Speaking of wonderful the backgrounds in the game look gorgeous and make the world all the more real. Also I forgot to mention voice acting so I'll do that now. All of the voice actors do an incredible job reading the scripteven Jensens voice actor although I found his voice to be a bit to raspy like Batmans but that is just a minor nitpick. Overall the game does incredibly well and stands up there is one of the best games I've played in a while which is why I'm glad to say Deus Ex Human Revolution earns an 8.5/10 it was worth the $60 dollar price line as it is but now that you can pick it up for $20 you'd be crazy not to pick it up.","September 6, 2014","true","72.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/256color/recommended/238010/","256color","michael","http://steamcommunity.com/id/256color/","315 products in account","This game is outstanding by more than one parameters, but I think its best side is the multi-choice storyline. To a reasonable extent the game offers you many ways to reach goals, and to slightly alter the storyline with your decisions, while keeping the integrity, not turning the story into a mess like some RPGs tend to do. You can play the game like a shooter, or avoid killing people. You can use stealth or go into a direct confrontation. You can hack doors or break through walls or find secret passages. Designers managed to push into the levels so many ways to reach the destination, without turning it into a chaos. Writers managed to do the same with the story. It's a clever game made by clever people.\n\nThe Director's Cut version of the game, however, is one step forward, two steps back. Although it does introduce alternative ways to defeat enemies during boss fights, but also, it introduces many bugs not present in the original version. I think that it also makes the game easier, at least I had more upgrades than I needed. It might be a nice thing for people who found the game too difficult, but I wouldn't say it was necessary. The worst thing is that it integrates The Missing Link DLC into the main game story. This decision was evidently NOT made by the game's director, because the DLC does not fit the main game. It was made afterwards, probably written afterwards, and was intended to be played afterwards. It's less polished, has a different feel to it, requires different tactics and has its own story arc. It should have stayed as a DLC. Luckily, I own both original and director's cut versions.\n\nIn spite of flaws introduced by Director's Cut, it is still a very, very good game. It is a shame the makers didn't have a budget to polish it and get rid of the bugs, and were forced to include The Missing Link DLC as a marketing measure.\n\nSo, I give the game itself 10/10, but the Director's Cut version gets 8/10.","September 2, 2014","true","77.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Sure, you can argue that it doesn't have a specific gameplay mechanic at all, considering it's a mesh of different genres such as being a sandbox, or an rpg, or just a straight-up fps. But, no matter what you're doing, no matter what genre you play this game for, it always requires you to do one thing:\n\nThink.\n\nDeus-Ex is a FPS with RPG elements that somehow feel balanced and extremely well fleshed out. One moment, you're in a facility, either sneaking around or killing, soldiers and terroists on the look-out for you. The next moment, you're in a city-hub, being enraptured in a world full of dark secrets to find in sewer vents or apartments. It's truly a game that can appeal to anyone!\n\nThe story of the game is that you play as an Ex-Cop named Adam Jensen, who, after handling a few terroist attacks with his new augmentations, send him on a quest full of conspiracy and political tension as he looks for a close friend of his. I can't say much after that, because then the story would be no fun! :) Let's just say that you're in for a fun ride, and we'll leave it at that. :)\n\nOverall, I recommend this game to any gamer of any kind. It's a game that is a perfect blend of a variety of genres that requires you to consider all of your actions, even those outside of dialogue sequences!\n\nSo, yeah, you may have never asked for this, but trust me: You won't regret it! <3","May 26","true","56.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It wasn't perfect (due to some bugs and glitches here and there), but otherwise, it was pretty damn close. May contain one minor spoiler.\n\nThe story itself was absolutely phenomenal. It was nice and deep, and explored a forbidden territory. Yeah, I suppose it can be a bit stereotypical where [Future Technology] is used by a government to militarize it and then [Religious] group/s riot and organize their own terrorist groups to fight it. We've seen it in many sci-fi games and movies. Regardless, the story was still very enjoyable and captivating, and it always kept me wanting more. I never skipped any of the cutscenes or cinematics, and I really liked the multiple endings at the end of the game. I also really enjoyed the side quests. They didn't contribute directly to the main story, but they showed how other people are being affected by it, such as certain girls being forced to get augmentations for their "job".\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, it reminds me a lot of Mass Effect, because of the conversation system (it looked almost identical) as well as the cover system. That's not a bad thing, though. Both of those things work very well with this game and let you pursue three main types of gameplays (though you can alter them as you go): Ghost, Pacifist, and Rambo (as I refer to them). Regardless of what you choose, the gameplay mechanics work well, hardly there is ever an issue with them, and there is just so much you can do in the game, such as hack terminals, or convince people to spill information, or stay in cover and kill enemies without them ever knowing where you are. The possibilities of what you do in the game are virtually limitless. It even has an open-world map that is divided into sections, so you can always explore it as you wish without having to be confined to tiny areas and be forced to do the main story missions, which is always a bonus for me.\n\nThe sound design was brilliant, too. The sound effects were decent, but the soundtrack was absolutely to die for. One of the best game soundtracks I have ever heard in my life. They never felt out of place; rather, they always complimented the gameplay, regardless of where you were, i.e. exploring the city, stuck in battle, watching a cinematic, or even just screwing around for fun. I will admit there were a few points where the soundtrack "froze" and was stuck in a tiny loop, but that was just a minor bug that was easily solved by just saving, restarting the game, and loading. A minor inconvenience, if you will.\n\nAll in all, this game was absolutely amazing. I'd easily give it a 9/10.

I really love delving into this cyberpunk world of human enhancement technologies, mega-corporations, mysterious figures behind the curtains and conspiracy theories. It's definitely a game for the curious and explorative type and those who like some older game theory mechanics like limited inventory management. Playing this through with the developer's commentary has been a blast; It's been great to discover just how much love and care went into this game, the little details that people paying close attention could notice (some of which I did and some I had no clue about) all over the place - I absolutely love the philosophy of a game world telling the story, their philosophy of "show, don't tell". It's just such a shame that technical, resource and time constraints limited the vision of the developers because despite DEHR being an already good game, I would have loved to have seen that full vision.

And things become more perfect since you can choose what style suits you best. Do you like stealth? sure to avoid camera and enemy, hacking into places, doing things unnoticed while taking down enemy one by one (and make a human pile with it). Or you love shooting enemy in the nuts and going uproar, the choose is yours.\n\nStory (10/10)\nEvery. single. action you take have different outcome. You like to kill? it's fine, you like to save people? you can do it too, you want to make someone get busted? there's an option for it. and not to mention those option is only for single event.\nThere's so many option you can do, from bragging, lowballing, anything. that makes you feel you're not tied to a single linear story. Different ending makes this game even more replay-able\n\nCharacter, Sound, and Narrating (8/10)\nSound effect absolutely awesome and well made. Meanwhile in every game you may skip every chit-chat because it's so boring, but not in DXHR, the character sub was very excellent, that you will sucked into and obviously don't want to skip it.\n\nGraphics (8.5/10)\ngraphic is subjectively depend on the person and objectively depend on the system. but for myself, graphic was well made, characters detail was top notch. City landscape, ship, labs, and every other place, including elevator, totally awesome.\n\n\n\nTL;DR\nAWESOME STEALTH ACTION GAME, if you never try deus ex before, go for this game first. it sums up every other deus ex game to date.\n\n","April 13, 2014","true","32.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The Directors Cut includes the controversial Missing Link DLC. I think the extra plot information added by the Missing Link DLC is important, and the level layout is very good, but the transition mechanic they decided to use (you automatically get captured and lose most of your augmentation points until finishing the DLC) was kind of a cheap cop-out from the designers. Players invest alot of time building up their character and taking all that progression away, even temporarily, is frustrating for a player.\n\nHowever you do get your augmentation points and other gear back after you finish Missing Link, and the story added by it is important, and thought provoking.\n\nThe game is definitely worth getting, just be sure to focus on the excellent story when you're playing Missing Link DLC and remember the pain of losing your augs will be temporary.","September 26, 2014","true","35.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

This game also has quite possibly one of the best soundtracks I’ve ever heard in a game. Michael McCann delivers some incredibly detailed and beautiful soundtracks that would make the game feel noticeably devoid of atmosphere without. The storytelling, rich narration and ability to choose your path, as well as the fate of others really makes each experience feel like your choices, and consequences mattered and have substance.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/238010/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","This game is simply brilliant.\n\nThe story starts out with Adam Jenson, a security officer, doing tours around his company's labs. Mercenaries strike without notice and steal some key technology regarding augments for the human body. Worst of all, a doctor that was leading the research is either dead or has disapeared with the attack. The story begins to get a lot more interesting and offers some serious ethical and moral issues behind merging the body with machines. I finished the game and from start to end there is no shortage interesting dialogue.\n\nThe game play is simply stunning on this one. What I liked about this Deus Ex having played previous versions, is that they didn’t decide to completely forget what the old games looked like. Rather, they put in place a modernized version of what used to be without too much of the shiny glitter you see in newly developped games. What I absolutely love about this game is that the environment is able to be manipulated. There is always a direct course of action, but there will be options available to go around conflict VIA vents or ladders. Some quests will require the player to stack some barrels in order to climb them to jump over a fence. Some quests there will be enemies in your way and you’ll be comtemplating about throwing the dumpster you’re taking cover behind. To throw heavy objects such as the latter object mentioned, the player needs to upgrade Adam’s arms to be able to pick up such weight.\n\nPraxis points are upgrade points that allow this to happen. Not only can Adam’s arms be upgraded, his eyes for example can be upgraded to see enemies through walls or see where they are looking. His strength can be further upgraded to punch through walls (that are slightly cracked) to hurt an opponent on the other side. Other body parts can be upgraded but not simply for more strength, attack abilities can be added or movement abilities. Some upgrades require 1 point while some take 2. To fall from any height requires two points, but is a great ability to have when jumping off a ledge running from multiple enemies (or if your just impatient and would rather jump down ladders). That is only the start of what can be upgraded, and it is only the start of adding a new depth to the game. The one minor complaint I have is that there is a limited ability to melee. The player requires certain energy cells to be at full power before Adam can use his special abilities (such as punching through a wall, a silent kill or knockout, or an explosive ability). The same applies to a melee scenario. Unless you want to use all your upgrade points on power cells, stealth speed is definitely limited. It is a good idea but when it comes to having the option of a melee button, it isn't there which sucks when your under pressure. The game is a beautiful in it’s FPS/RPG elements, but they’ve added a third person element when it comes to taking cover. Pressing LT will put the camera over the shoulder of Adam and allow for a Gears of War shooting style.\n\nThis is greatly appreciated as the player can quickly get overrun by enemies. If that’s not enough depth, they’ve added hacking features. This isn’t limited to hacking simple computers, camera’s, turret’s, heck even giant mechs can be hacked. It isn’t any boring hacking game either, the count-down timer and the art styles they chose to display the hacks can really make a player nervous when it comes to cut-throat last seconds. When not in a mission, the player is allowed to free roam and explore the area. Area’s can be tampered with and civilians or thugs (or even police) can be knocked out or killed. Once you do this though, that is it, you’ve made your bed and if anyone caught you, they may hate you for the rest of the game. There definitely is no shortage of game play here. Be careful in choosing when to use a gun as the game watches how you act morally (whether you kill or knock out opponents). The AI enemies also are quite brilliantly done. They will not go one dimension on you and attack from one spot, they will move around and often will try to ambush you from all sides. Really well done here.\n\nThe player can choose to follow the main story line missions or choose to do side missions.\n\nThe sounds are appropriate and the visuals are quite stunning. The setting the put the game is absolutely suits it. One minute you feel like your walking through a rich neighborhood and the next your looking at a gloomy sky from some sort of ghetto projects. The dialogue is excellent and the voice acting is far from cheap.\n\nThe saving scheme was done absolutely right for this game. There is an auto save feature but there exists a saving feature where if you save it, that’s exactly where you’ll be loaded. If your in the midst of being shot, and like saving in a heated situation, by all means go for it. Even if you forget to save the auto save has your back ! I wish every game had this. The menus are all neatly organized and easy to navigate. This game absolutely nailed it when it came to interface.\n\nI would absolutely recommend this game on sale or not. I wish that they made an online multiplayer mode and would be something to work on for future Deus Ex games. Heck, even local coop would add a lot of re playability here. I would love to see them keep this sort of concept when making the next one, but I wouldn’t mind a few surprises. The environment can be manipulated and at times broken but I’d like to see real world elements of where if a explosive goes off, I’d like to see a few walls or floors rip.\n\n\nRATING : 8.2/10\n\n\nScreenShots :\nVisual screenshot. I used a controller the entire game but as shown below, you can easily switch to keyboard. Inventory is very easy to manage in-game\n\nMe, carrying a turret while a turret I hacked is watching my back\n\nAnother visual, with a throw-able flammable object in view","April 26, 2015","true","19.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Where to begin?\n\nWell, the basic premise of the game is that you take the roll of Adam Jensen: an ex-cop and current security manager of Sarif Industries, a leading developer of controversial augmentations, which allow a person to be genetically and mechanically enhanced in almost any way possible. You are witness to a massacre and mysterious raid on a Sarif Plant where he and his girlfriend work, and you search to find out what happened, and where the scientists and Megan, your girlfriend, have gone, if they are even still alive. And as you go on, encountering key players in the government, augmentation industry, and military powers, the conspiracy grows deeper, starting to reveal a darker intent that expands into almost every facet of human society.\n\nNeedless to say, the story is phenomenal: with gameplay and conversation based-choices that impact how the story progresses, and what others think of you, this game lets you play it the way YOU want to, not just as some on-rails shooter like Call of Duty, both based on Story and Gameplay. This game will make you think, not just about how to approach obstacles, but about what is 'right and wrong' in how humanity must evolve, what actually makes us human? How far must we go to get what we want, even if others might get hurt in the process, and more.\n\nSpecifically about the gameplay: you can play this game, much like the original, in just about any way imaginable. Lethally or non-lethally, stealthily or guns-blazing, or even solving problems without having to knock anyone out or killing anyone, just by proper communication through the persuasion of who you are talking to. Outnumbered and outgunned, you can use many routes to accomplish your goal, using vents, moving heavy objects, back alleys, even hacking computer terminals to open doors, disable cameras, and turn turrets and robots off OR against your enemies.\nThere are a variety of weapons and tools, from standard weaponry like pistols and rifles, to laser weaponry and even non-lethal guns like the Tranquilizer Rifle and Stun Gun. Each weapon can be upgraded through weapon mods you buy and find hidden in levels, and also, just about every aspect of your character can be upgraded: from health, to shooting, even hacking and taking out multiple enemies with melee attacks.\n\nPut into simple words: this game is played how YOU want to play it, performing actions and making choices based on your preferences of playstyle and even ethics. You do what you feel is right, and what you feel needs to be done to reach your goal in a world full of risks, people who will lie, decieve, and manipulate, where conspiracies are abundant in a technologically advanced world, that shows that even with advances in the world around us, humanity itself will always face the same problems that they must overcome, in trying times of uncertainty.\n\nA instant classic that you simply NEED to play. Especially if it is on sale. This game is worth playing: it's a smart, sexy, classy FPS and RPG hybrid that nails the story, atmosphere, soundtrack, and gameplay in just about every way imaginable, and is my all-time favorite game that deserves to be experienced.","August 31, 2014","true","57.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Every situation has multiple ways of solving it. You can play as a pacifist stealth player, or you can mount an all-out assault. The augmentation system is well-done and gives you plenty of bad-*** moments.\n\nMy only gripe is that the story is so-so. The overall theme is thought-provoking -- is the idea of human augmentation good or bad? -- but the writing itself is pretty cliche. We have big evil corporations, Illuminati, subplots within subplots ad infinitum, and so on. The actual gameplay is super-fun though and makes this a must-play game.","November 8, 2014","true","59.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Sure, you can, and is in my opinion the funniest way to play this game. As a bonus, every bosses in this game can be killed/knocked out while staying in the shadows. This way, you can even finish the whole game without firing a single bullet.\n\nOr maybe do you prefer those frontal assaults, doing ♥♥♥♥♥ons of noises and killing every enemies on your way ? Well, you also can, thanks to the complete arsenal at your disposition, rewarding every play style, such as sniping targets from afar, or going all-in with that heavy rifle, along with a couple mines/grenades.\n\nWhichever play style you choose, the levels are incredibly detailed, and often full of computers you can hack to discover secrets, hidden doors, stories about the background of the game, or even mails telling you that this guy went to the bar with some friends some days ago, giving life to the characters, even the minor ones. Exploration will also be highly rewarded, such as giving you alternate ways to take care of the bosses, unlocking some side quests, or providing more information on your surroundings. Additionally, there are ALWAYS more than one way to do something.  For example, I especially loved the part where the prisoners and the scientist you had to save are being killed by the gas, and you are prompted to quickly choose between saving the scientist or the prisoners. Most players didn't realise that there is an other way, which is to find and destroy the hidden gas tank really fast (of course, the game doesn't tell you that such a possibility exist, neither where the gas tank is), rewarding you with help later in the plot.\n\nAlso, it is important to say that your actions have consequences on the future of the game. Thus, if you let that guy live out of mercy he might come back to try to kill you once more. Or maybe will he help you, it's up to you to choose.\n\nTo achieve your objectives, you will be able to choose from a wide number of augmentations, helping you jump higher, fall from any height, immunising you to gas, making you tougher, able to see through walls, or even changing you into a master hacker.\n\nFinally, as usual in the Deus Ex's, the devs make the player doubt, making him question the morality of his actions, and also raising quite a lot of philosophical questions related to the development of the human race.\n\nA major problem about this game is that if you actually explore every levels carefully and unlock these secrets, you will quickly realise how easy it is to gain experience to level up your augmentations, thus making you able to get every augs in one single playthrough, which is kinda game breaking.\n\nTL; DR: #buythisgame\n","August 5, 2014","true","46.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

However, the voice acting can be sometimes dull, being a fan of voice acting in every game, I can say that this particular one is rather questionable. In terms of gameplay, Deus Ex: Human Revolution has done it's job, it's smooth, challenging and you need to act fast in every situation.\nTo top it off, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a step forward for the cyberpunk RPG genre.

The boss battles are a little different and The Missing Link is now integrated, but other than that there are no other changes or improvements to the game.\n\nWhen you're put into the Missing Link portion, all of your upgrades and items are taken from you. You then build up what you want and at the end of the Missing Link portion everything is returned. I hope that doesn't spoil anything.

Technology that blends man and machine has allowed "augmented" humans to run faster, think quicker, grow stronger, and rise above their genetics to be the person they want to be -- provided they have a lot of money and don't mind requiring lifelong medication to ensure their bodies don't reject the enhancements.Oh, and they'll have to endure contempt from everybody who isn't like them, fear growing civil unrest, and live in a world rife with unchecked corporate power and corrupt political machinations.Yes, the world of Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a miserable one. However, you won't want it to end.Deus Ex: Human Revolution tells the story of Adam Jensen, head of security at Sarif Industries, an American corporation making huge strides in augmentation technology. However, not all of humanity is appreciative of Sarif's dabbling in human progress, and after a group of mercenaries attacks the company headquarters, Jensen is mortally wounded. He doesn't quite die, however, becoming both the beneficiary and victim of his own company's latest step forward in human modification. He returns to the world of the living better than he ever was, but that doesn't mean he has to be happy about it. After all, he never asked for this.Thus the scene is set for a game that travels around the world, weaving social commentary and philosophy on the nature of transhumanism throughout a tale that touches on corporate espionage, global conspiracy, and well-intentioned extremism. As well as living up to the sacred legacy kickstarted by the original Deus Ex, Human Revolution's narrative takes the very best of Metal Gear Solid, merrily pinches elements from Blade Runner, and adds its own unique blend of fascinating characters and satisfying plot twists. It is, in short, one of the most intriguingly written, thematically ambitious games I have ever played.In no small part does Human Revolution owe its narrative success to an absorbing atmosphere. This crapsack world, driven by stunning advances in technology but stifled by class conflict and growing social resentment, is an absolute joy to navigate despite being so utterly depressing. From the tightly designed action stages to the overwhelming hub maps, there's a consistency to the game's world that one only rarely sees, and everything from interactive newspapers, hacked emails and conversations between non-player characters creates a compelling ambiance for a world that is hard to want to leave. It's most certainly a world nobody in their right mind would ever want to live in, but it's an intoxicating place to visit.Human Revolution is mindful of the huge weight that the Deus Ex name carries, and I am thrilled to report that it lives up to the daunting demands that such a pedigree entails. As with the original classic, this is a game designed to let you play it your way, with a variety of upgradable augmentations to create an Adam Jensen that suits your personal idiom. Whether you want to be stealthy or aggressive, lethal or merciful, you have the tools to do the job. Combat is a unique blend of first-person and third-person gameplay, where forward-thinking and pragmatic actions are rewarded. While there is a run-and-gun option in the first-person perspective, such activity would be suicide. Even when one fully upgrades their ability to absorb damage, Jensen is far from immortal and will drop in seconds when exposed to gunfire. With a right-click (or shoulder button press), however, Jensen will stick to a wall and the camera will shift to a third-person perspective. This is not only crucial for stealthy play, it also gives a great vantage point in what can become a very intense cover-based shooter.Success in combat is determined by careful planning. Securing an exit should things go wrong, choosing (and changing) advantageous positions, and identifying which target to fire upon first, as well as which weapons to use, are crucial. This is not a game that just lets you open fire and trust in your reflexes; this is a game in which strategy is just as important as skill. Adam Jensen may be an augmented human, but he is still a human, and the game never lets you forget it.Stealth is simply superb, and players who wish to remain subtle will find that the game is perfectly tailored to their secret-agent fantasies. The third-person viewpoint in cover gives players an excellent view of the surrounding area and allows them to memorize enemy movement patterns without becoming exposed. Even with this benefit, however, stealth is no cakewalk. Enemies don't just march along patrol routes, oblivious to their surroundings. They love to intermittently walk backwards, or stop at crossroads in corridors to check all available directions.Whether players choose to be stealthy or violent, they will find that the "Takedown" ability is a lifesaver. When Adam gets close to an enemy, he can instantly neutralize him with a single keystroke. The camera will switch to third-person and Jensen will take down an opponent with a beautiful, empowering combat animation. Simply pressing the "Q" key will see Adam knock an enemy unconscious, whereas keeping it held will cause him to extend some vicious blades from his arm and put the poor victim away permanently. Do not think that this skill is a game-breaker, however. Adam can only perform takedowns if he has at least one full energy bar, and only the first bar ever recharges automatically. Hacking is by far one of the most essential elements of the game, and it's highly recommended that hack augmentations are equipped early. Not only does hacking net significant amounts of XP and cash, it also unlocks doors to vital equipment and plot-sensitive areas, rewards players with heaps of cool information and Easter eggs, and eliminates various security measures such as lasers, alarms, cameras and turrets.The only downside to the hacking is that various cool skills, such as the ability to control enemy turrets and robots, aren't all that useful. Their applicable uses in the game are minimal due to the limited number of computers that actually control such items, and the sheer effort it takes to reach them.Finally, we have the social gameplay. This aspect is presented as a variety of "Social Boss Battles" in which Jensen must verbally outwit an opponent in a debate. This represents one of the game's most accomplished innovations, and also its biggest missed opportunity. In short, these conversational fights are incredibly well done, with the player needing to anticipate which responses will work best against characters, using whatever they've learned about their personalities and how they react to Jensen's words. Each of these sequences is engaging and unique, just as accomplished as anything found in RPGs like Mass Effect.There's no question about Human Revolution's sheer volume of content. There's lots to see, even more to do, and multiple ways of enjoying both. While one could theoretically blast through Human Revolution in eight or ten hours, there's much, much more to be getting on with. City-based hub areas contain side quests that are as lengthy and intricate as any of the mandatory tasks. I managed to spend a whole five hours simply wandering around the Detroit hub, soaking in the sights, exploring every square inch, listening to enthralling NPC conversations, and beating all the quests.What truly impresses isn't so much the scale of the game, but its staggering consistency of quality. Every quest is a compelling story; every level is beautifully, ingeniously designed; and not once does the game ever become dull or lose its pacing.Deus Ex: Human Revolution, like its augmented hero, is a step above its mundane peers. With its flowing, open approach to mission structure, thoroughly engrossing story and gorgeous visuals, this is the kind of game that all others should strive to be.","March 30, 2014","true","352.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

A stealth-FPS-RPG that's was well worth the two playthroughs (So far) I've given it. It's a little janky due to the fact it's age is showing a bit, but this game definitely lives up to the praise I've heard for the Deus Ex series.\n\nFor your information, here's the changes the Director's Cut has. I firmly believe that the Director's Cut is definitely the version you should buy due to some of the reasons listed below:\n\n-Apparently, worse graphics. I don't really give much of a damn personally, but there it is. It's almost certainly solvable if you're willing to install mods.\n\n-Altered boss battle design. If you haven't heard, the original HR's bosses pretty much forced the player to go guns blazing. This meant that if you were a stealthy, hacker character, you still had to carry some lethal weapons in your pocket in preperation for the boss, or you'd die very, very quick. This has been fixed to an extent; The game still forces you into lethal (I'm pretty sure you can take the bosses down with nonlethals, but it's very ineffective and they die in terms of the narrative anyway, not to mention they're excluded from no killing achievements), buuut every boss has a few secret areas you can access if you're a smarter player that will defeat the boss easily without you having to really fight them yourself.\n\n-The Missing Link DLC has now been seamlessly integrated into the story. For those who don't know, The Missing Link actually takes place during the story of HR's plotline, not after or before it; So, in the Director's Cut not only is Missing Link included, but you start playing the DLC when it actually happens during the narrative rather than as a seperate experience.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned the boss battle redesign and the Missing Link's integration offsets the graphics downgrade, though the downgrade isn't appreciated. If you're hankering for a nice first-person stealth game, this is a nice choice.","April 11","true","62.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bordje/recommended/238010/","bordje","Bordje |-/","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bordje/","350 products in account","TLDR VERDICTDE: HR is really the definitive Cyberpunk RPG of today, and I don’t see that changing until the already announced sequel, Mankind Divided, releases. That, or CD Projekt Red starts talking about Cyberpunk 2077 again. An absolute must buy on sale if you haven’t played it.\n\nFULL REVIEW BELOW\n“I never asked for this. If you want to make enemies, try to change something. The year is 2027. It is a time of great innovation and technological advancement. It is also a time of chaos and conspiracy. I don’t even know whose side I’m on.” – Adam Jensen\n\nAdam Jensen is a retired SWAT specialist and current chief of security at Sarif industries, a leading biotechnology company that is in the business of human evolution. A sudden attack on the company’s Detroit laboratories leave Jensen all-but-dead and brought back from the brink through mechanical augmentations. Six months later, Jensen returns faster and stronger than ever to hunt down those responsible…\n\nThis review is written from the perspective of a massive fan of stealth action games with an emphasis on multiple approaches to scenarios. Also a fan of story driven RPGs with ambiguous morality, however I have not played any previous Deus Ex games. It may also be worth mentioning that this was my favourite game of 2011.\n\nGAMEPLAY AND DESIGNDeus Ex: Human Revolution is… well it’s whatever you want it to be. It can be a cover-based third person shooter, a first-person shooter, a violent stealth action game, a silent ghost stealth game or some sort of weird amalgamation of all of those things. The level design is absolutely stellar and accommodates all of the options listed above. The game gives you a start point, an end point and lets you figure out how you want to get there yourself. It’s down to you to investigate all the hidden nooks and crannies for that air vent or item stash and exploration and player intelligence is definitely rewarded. You get the option on how to approach combat too. Naturally, murder grants the most options and non-lethal or complete pacifism limit you more for an increased challenge. It still feels rewarding to have traversed a level without anyone knowing you there until after the fact, similarly to Hitman.\n\nUnfortunately, some players may feel limited despite the number of options, due to the nature of the character progression system. Jensen starts the game with a fraction of the augmentations he is supposed to have, requiring you to “turn on” the rest of them over the course of the game. These grant pretty cool bonuses that suit various playstyles like better armour for gunfights or seeing through walls for stealth. Unfortunately, these upgrades are tied to an XP system where you get a point every time you level up. Non-lethal and stealth playstyles are rewarded with more XP than loud and lethal playstyles. This can make players feel pressured to do everything stealthy just to keep up with upgrades even if they may not want to.\n\nThe boss fights were also a pretty big gripe for a lot of people playing this game when it originally came out. They broke up the narrative as the player was force to kill them, meaning those focussed on non-lethal stealth runs couldn’t beat the game with a 100% clear conscious. It also affected gameplay as stealth players had to waste inventory space and augment upgrades on lethal weapons just for bosses. This was annoying, as most people wouldn’t use that stuff in any other context. Luckily, the Director’s Cut version of the game has reworked the boss fights, allow you to sneak around the arenas using hacking and stealth to take out bosses. Unfortunately, all the bosses still need to be killed, except for the DLC one who can be subdued non-lethally.\n\nSTORY AND NARRATIVEThe story in DE:HR is wonderfully crafted. It starts as a fairly compelling justice/revenge story (depending on how you roleplay) that ends up turning into a worldwide conspiracy hunt. You go from location to location, following lead to lead without it ever feeling stale. It constantly keeps things fresh by throwing more and twists and deception without really overdoing things. There are dialogue choices which can influence things to a degree, but Adam Jensen remains very much his own character as opposed to a blank slate to imprint yourself on. There are some pretty neat sections in the game where dialogue choices have to be used carefully in order to coerce certain characters to do things by reading them and telling them what they might want to hear. It feels refreshing to have an RPG protagonist with an actual past and a place in the world as opposed to being an empty vessel with the sole purpose of driving the story forward. Of course, if you are into customisation and heavy roleplay you might be a bit disappointed.\n\nAs much as people like to make fun of the “I never asked for this” line, the voice acting in the game is pretty good and serves its purpose well enough. It’s not exactly exceptional and it can be pretty jarring when Elias Toufeix (Adam Jensen) delivers lines that are supposed to be compassionate, cold, convincing, pleading etc. in the same raspy voice. Granted, it is a pretty awesome voice. The strength definitely lies more in the writing itself rather than the actors delivering it. The game is able to tackle a lot of complex themes, with a very prevalent one being the ethical implications of artificial human enhancement. I found that it really made me think quite deeply on world issues that haven’t even happened yet, but I was still considering what side of the argument I might want to fall on by the end of the game.\n\nThe world and atmosphere is built up pretty nicely through NPC banter, ebooks, newspapers, pocket secretaries and emails scattered everywhere for you to dive into or ignore completely. Side quests are also done very well, with the developers having opted for quality over quantity. There are only a few of them per hub area, but they are all compelling with their own self-contained story. Regarding DLC, the Director’s Cut version of the game is the definitive one. It incorporates the DLC into the game where it chronologically goes rather that making it a separate install like in the base game. The DLC is also a very good one (they only made one) and that alone makes it totally worth getting the Director’s Cut version of the game.\n\nVISUALS, PERFORMANCE AND PC PORTDE: HR came out in 2011 and is a decent looking game for its time. The Director’s Cut version did improve some textures, but the game does still look pretty dated overall. The character models look pretty nice, but awkwardly done lip syncing on the faces during conversations is pretty jarring. The animations are all pretty well choreographed and the melee stealth kills are super satisfying as a result. The pre-rendered cinematics are a bit off putting, considering that in game engine actually looks better than most of them. Fortunately, there are only a handful of them throughout the game.\n\nThe world design is where this game really shines. The game really prevails in its visual design and art style rather than raw graphical fidelity. All of the environments are designed and come together really nicely to create this ideal cyberpunk feel that no other game has really come anywhere close to. Every area looks unique and vibrant and it was more than once that I had to stop running around and just look out the window to appreciate the background of whatever future city I was in.\n\nThe game performed well for me, on several systems ranging from a HD 7770 to a GTX 970. I rarely noticed any drops from a stable 60 if there were any at all. Graphics options were all acceptable with everything you would expect. The game has full support for both M+KB and controller, but you'll want to opt for the former if you can.","September 16, 2015","true","33.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"Five bucks to fix the boss fights?" I yelled at my computer. "Go to hell and take your cheap augs with you!" This is why I'm just getting to playing it now, and I really wish the publisher didn't pull this move. Charging people money to fix parts of the game that are sub-par is something I expect from small developers who genuinely need the dough, not from multi-national publishers who complain that six million sales of a video game constitutes a financial failure. There's a lot of stuff in here - the Director's Cut unifies the game with all of its pre-order content and DLC packs, puts the DLC chapter "The Missing Link" where it's supposed to be positioned in with the story, and FIXES THE AWFUL BOSS FIGHTS. Also there's upscaled textures, commentary, blah blah blah, like a game from 2011 really needed upscaled textures.\n\nIn my original review for Human Revolution, I called it 75% good because the boss battles kept ruining the atmosphere, and the end of the game is just basically little more than a zombie level with a big room where you push a button and get an ending. Massively disappointing given how high the game was flying.\n\nBut unfortunately, time has not been kind to Human Revolution, much like time has not been kind to Deus Ex. I've just realized how much the structure of the game ♥♥♥♥s with the atmosphere and I ended up skipping past entire (not very well voiced) conversations to get to the part where I get to figure out the best way to troll soldiers and gangsters. (The best way to troll them is by dragging a vending machine into the room and using it as a big corporate capitalist battering ram, I've found). The game is not as smart as it thinks it is, and talks all these issues over transhumanism and whether chopping off your arm for a robot arm is a blah blah blah I'M BORED MR. VENDING MACHINE WANTS TO SELL YOU SOMETHING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥\n\nIt's a big, fascinating game with lots of secrets and things to play around with. You can mix and match your playstyle with the lovely augmentation system. Whenever it tries to talk SERIOUS, THOUGHT-PROVOKING ISSUES I just tune the ♥♥♥♥ out.\n\nIf you want to play Human Revolution, get the Director's Cut if you don't have it already. If you have the original, you're not missing out on much, but you will have to play with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss battles, so don't lean too hard on your non-lethal playstyle. Whichever version you get, I have some advice for you: Before you enter Panachea (the last section of the game), quit. Start a new game if you like. Just pretend Adam Jensen says "♥♥♥♥ this, ♥♥♥♥ you, you're all doomed", and goes to Aruba to beat everybody at competitive speed limbo competitions with his augmented body.

I even want to play through it again for more achievements that I missed on the first play through and most games nowadays fail to in interest me that much like COD Black ♥♥♥♥♥ (cough cough Activison sucks). Most games don’t have play value but this one did. This game was intense and kept me on the edge of my seat because of the amazing storyline and how well this game was compiled. The excellent graphics added to a more immersed experience to make me feel like I was there snapping a man’s neck behind a wall. The stealth mechanics were outstanding for a game that also focused on an extensive combat system with an upgrade system. I really enjoyed the boss fights as well because you had a choice to how you wanted to defeat them using hacking, pure strength and fire power, or using the environment against them, it gave a sense of freedom. The futuristic feel this game had was amazing and it was an amazing experience overall. It even inspired me to write a paper about biotechnology and how it is stealing fire from the gods for my college professor that got an A. This has to be my favorite “modern” game of the decade and I recommend that anyone who has a soul to play this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rxlict/recommended/238010/","rxlict","Relict","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rxlict/","607 products in account","Quick Note: The original Deus Ex: HR entry has now been replaced by the newly released Director's Cut edition, so I will write my recommendation on this.\n\nDeus Ex: Human Revolution is an action RPG set within a modern cyberpunk world in the year 2027. You enter this world as Adam Jensen, a private security officer working for Sarif Industries. As you initially start the game, you'll see it is a time where humanity is split due to their contrasting views on human augmentations, but of course, that's not all there is to it.\n\nStory-wise, this game is absolutely perfect. The game is set before the original Deus Ex game (25 years earlier to be exact). The script is very thought-provoking and quote-worthy. As you proceed through the game, you'll be able to read scattered e-books lying around, as well as e-mails on specific computer workstations. This will give you more insight into the story. If you approach random NPC's, they will tell you their own personal views. There are 5 main locations that you'll be able to visit, all of which have their own side quests scattered around that'll also give you even more insight within the outstanding plot of this game. There are many organizations, such as the aforementioned "Sarif Industries" that serve their own specific purposes. There are also references to certain mythologies that serve a subtle connection to the original game.\n\nGraphically, the game has a wonderfully intense gold and black theme that is present throughout. There is a somewhat common issue that you may experience where certain glitches such as tearing and stuttering may occur, as well as character models (both face and body) acting quite irregular. However, I am pretty sure this has been corrected within the Director's Cut edition of the game. (Don't quote me on this). Textures have generally been improved also.\n\nIn regards to gameplay, you essentially have two approaches: stealth or non-stealth. Hell, you could go for the mixed bag, but I wouldn't recommend it. Both styles have their own advantages and disadvantages, but I'll leave you to decide your play-style for yourself. The game showcases specific weaponry tailored to either style that you'll come across whilst playing. There are boss fights within the game that the new DC edition has reworked completely to allow players to use different play-styles instead of being restricted to a non-stealthy approach. There is also the addition of a new documentary and commentary by Eidos Montreal. Previous DLC expansions and missions have been fully integrated within the game and another new and exciting feature that has been implemented is the 'New Game+' mode. This mode allows you to carry over your augmentations and weaponry from your first play-through. For anyone who likes collecting achievements and trading cards/backgrounds/emoticons, those have also been implemented.\n\nPersonally, this game is a firm 10/10. I absolutely adore this game and I could not recommend it enough. It is worth the full price-tag by far. This game is a firm number two on my top-ten list of games. Also, if you happen to own the original version of DE:HR, you'll receive a 50% discount for the Director's Cut edition. Furthermore, if you own the 'Missing Link' DLC expansion, that will add 25% to the discount giving you 75% off the entire game, which should work out as $5 for those of you in the USA and around £3.25 for the British.\n\nI implore you to buy this game. It is outstanding.\n","October 25, 2013","true","0.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

However you want to mix it up is perfectly viable. Sneaking pacifist, gun slinging psychopath? It's up to you, but fair warning, there are portions where stealth is absolutely mandatory and the game will straight up murder you for run and gun. The story is interesting and thought provoking. The zones are fantastic looking, and the upgrade system lets you customize but will leave you wanting more upgrade points (which it should).\n\nIt is an absolutely fantastic game that is horribly, horribly let down by it's ending. It's ME3 levels of bad, or at the least incomprehensible and baffling. It's a very unfulfilling way to end Adam Jensen's story. My advice, buy the game, play it, love it, and just try your best to forget that the last 0.1% of the game was such a letdown after how good the first 99.9% is.\n\n9/10","November 10, 2014","true","42.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaosorigin/recommended/238010/","chaosorigin","OriginAtrocity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaosorigin/","208 products in account","After Invisible War, vast swathes of people who enjoyed the original Deus Ex clung to the common hope that Human Revolution would be a return to form. While the initial release of DX:HR in 2011 went some way to accomplishing this feat, it didn't emerge from its development completely untainted by the effects of the modern day.\n\nThe story and the world were certainly much closer to the original game than its predecessor, allowing multiple methods of accomplishing the game's objectives and a near-future setting depicting the burgeoning transhumanism that the original game - set 25 years later - would have embraced.\n\nHowever, the main gripe that the fans had with the DX:HR of 2011 was the boss battles; the unavoidable fights into which the story shoved you which could only be done a single way: utilising brute force. This simply wasn't the Deus Ex way and, as expected, the outcry was quick to begin.\n\nThankfully, with the advent of the Director's Cut edition, this gripe has very much been ironed out. While the fights themselves are still present - due to the adversaries being somewhat pivotal to the storyline - the arenas in which they take place have had themselves an overhaul, allowing a player to finally use their Jensen's strengths to dispatch the enemy.\n\nNow, the "brute force" approach is just one option of many as opposed to the mandatory route of progression. While it's not possible to simply sneak out the door and bypass the fights, those players who went for the stealthy hacker route will finally have a way to use those strengths directly, whether by controlling turrets, awakening mechs or opening up lockers full of additional supplies.\n\nThe Director's Cut edition also comes with the Missing Link DLC fully integrated, meaning that instead of having to load up the DLC separately as required previously (the original editions of both come up as separate "games" on Steam), the Director's Cut will simply transition into the Missing Link content at the appropriate point in the base game's story, making the complete game a more cohesive whole as well as more convenient to play than the original release.\n\nAnd, at only £12.99, it's definitely worth it if you're into the Deus Ex series. While many will argue that the original Deus Ex, coupled with mods such as New Vision, is the better game, the Director's Cut version of DX:HR is by no means a bad entry in the series. If you were holding off on account of the boss battles or the DLC being separate from the base games, now's probably the time to jump in. It often ends up getting discounted in Steam Sales too, so there's that.","December 16, 2014","true","28.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In a scientific clarity and realism, situations and persons are contrived which epitomize the philisophical challenges of these new technologies. The questions such as; what are the inherit qualities of nanotechnology, robotics, and artificial intelligence? Do they leane towars the positive or negative? Are they like other tools, in which then it is mearly defined by how they are used and seen? You see this game is filled with these intellectual riddles. Do you help direct humanity, by examplifying the usage of this technology in a positive manner? Or do you exemplify the risk of such technology going postal? In turn, situation after situation, you define the answer. You create your future.\n\nOne cannot disregard story in games. It is quintessential to a quality product. This game epitomizes that. The characters, their depth, their intricatcy. Their human nature and its ability to exploit any environment and situation. It shows you humans tryin to deal with this new technology. It shows how the black market and why, it would develop. It shows you how, with so much power, it would without a doubt produce 'abuse of power.'\n\nThe graphics are clean and crisp. The environment has a color tone consistent with the mood and atmosphere that the game creators were clearly trying to portray. They also never failed in producing a stylistic, yet technology robust environment. Simulateneously, they effectively showed the cotnrast of socio-economic status and their concording types of technology. There was no atmospheric shortage of visual stimulation. Although some NPC could of used better models, it is essentially irrelevent.\n\nThe gameplay is a mixture, the original deus ex fused with MGS/GearsOfWar style stealth and cover. The PC is most definitely the best way to play this game. I have played it on the PS3 and, while it was fantastic, it was even better on the PC.\n\nIt is still, easily, one of the best games I have played in a long time. Even though it has it's flaws, the story is so good at sucking you into the world of Deus Ex, you forget all technical wrongs and focus on finding Dr. Reed. You quickly learn it is bigger than a mere rescue mission. It becomes a question of humanity and society's right to guide itself or be guided. The philisophical depth of the game forces you to consider every move and every word, for every action has an equal re-action. So sit down, smoke a cigerrate, and get ready becauase this game will do more than entertaine. It will make you think.\n\nI must of played atleast 50 hours on this game. That time is including the original Deus Ex Humar Revolution. The game doesn't bore or disincentivise. It fosters inquisition into the truth. You want to know what is happening and why, your not forced, like so many games feel. Furthermore, what the truth is...well that is relative.\n\nThis is the newly released Director's Cut, which has also been patched and is fully functional. I had absolutely no problems after the patch.\n\nStop reading a bunch of nonesense, stop doubting yourself.

Though some may wish that therewere more options to choose from, anything is much better than the linear shooters we have come to know, where all one has to do is hold a button, run down a hallway. and aim for the head.\n\nThe other part of this is game is heavily plot driven, giving ~40 hours of story which is very engaging, but unfortunatly a little predictable.  Dealing with the morallity and ethics of cybernetic enhancement, the true meaning of freedom, and the role of corporate greed in both, the game provides thought provoking scenarios and opens up many topics that humanity should probably start thinking about in the near future.  Personally, I found that the only setback story-wise was the inability to roleplay, or even feel like your character is developing with the information you are discovering.  Many times in the game I found that my natural reactions to events were not presented by the games main character, who tends to be either extremely sassy, or just ignorant and impatient.\n\nThis game is a great play and definetly worth checking out, and I would recommend it to anyone that isn't deterred by the fact that it is ~40 hour game about sneaking around with robot limbs trying to stop the ILLOOMINAUGHTY.","September 2, 2015","true","43.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game begins in 2027 with Adam Jensen, an ex-SWAT now working as corporate security advisor for a large bio-tech company, Sarif Industries. During an attack at Sarif HQ by an unknown military unit, Jensen is critically wounded, and is forced into surgical procedures to remain alive. While Adam survives the incident, his body has undergone enormous changes due to the cybernetic augmentations. Now made a true super-soldier, with his new set of skills he must find out who was behind this attack and what were the reasons for it to have happened.\n\nThe world the player meets is one with a massive duality. On one side, biotechnology and cybernetics have been taking man to new extremes, with augmented senses, intellect, abilities and giving normal lives to once-disabled citizens, painting a bright picture for some. The less fortunate, however, are faced with poverty and an economic crash with massive worldwide oil shortages, as well as the augmentees who could not pay for maintenances and a necessary drug to avoid implant rejections often end with being driven into insanity and other drug overdoses, causing a tone of tension, apprehension and uncertainty about the future. The population is polarized between those who support the improvement and usage of augmentations, as a hope for a brighter future, and those who oppose this, as it's being exploited as a mean to control the population, and blurs the line between human and machine beyond a reasonable point.\n\nJensen's actions-- and views on this world, are only for the player to take.\n\nPlot\nHuman Revolution's story progresses from what seems to be a tragic incident of corporate warfare against Sarif Industries, as the bio-tech industry sparks animosity between population to the point violent demonstrations occur from both sides. These attacks, and violent demonstrations prove to be different parts of a grand scheme, as Jensen finds out the truth and the plot unravels.\n\nThe story decidedly had some thought and care put into it. Details both small and large are to catch the eye and this unique world-building provides an interesting base for a debate on the matter of what measure would be human as the augmentations in the game both show how far new abilities can take augmentees, and how high the cost is when the barriers are pushed too far and start to blur between a decided human and a machine.\n\nGameplay\nIn Human Revolution, players are provided with a variety of skills and tactics to play through and a number of different methods to play. Lethal, actiony combat, nonlethal combat, stealth infiltration and approaches, are among some of the possible gameplay tactics a player can adopt. Having done a Pacifist, a mixed and a guns-blazing run on the maximum difficulty, it's somewhat safe to say the combat and overall gameplay value will depend on how the player chooses to act, and how well they do at it.\n\nA skill tree with cybernetic augment abilities and a variety of weaponry provide the player with a number of choices. Sensing enemies through walls, optical camouflage, physical strength among others are some of the abilities the game offers, along a selection of sniper rifles, crossbows, sub-machineguns, handguns and assault weapons.\n\nGraphics\nThe game is rather dated, so admittedly, graphics didn't exactly age the best. In my personal opinion, it's nothing to write home about but they do an acceptable work of conveying a good visual experience along the gameplay.\n\nMusic and Sound\nEnvironments such as factory and laboratory interiors as well as warehouses provide this variety of industrial machinery and computer sounds, while the streets and alleys of the city hub areas give the player a sense of a busy urban center.\n\nThe soundscape is paired with the original soundtrack featuring lead composer Michael McCann (also known for leading soundtracks of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent and XCOM: Enemy Unknown) provides a sense of mysterious tension and a suspense among Human Revolution's world of dualities, as it's filled with a fast-paced mixture of heavy percussion and synthesizers along orchestrated pieces for combat tracks, and synth ambient tracks for non-combat situations.\n\nPersonal favorite pieces include Sarif Industries' ambient theme, Derelict Row's Combat theme, "Hengsha Daylight" on both the ambient and combat segments, the title song "Icarus" and the finale's theme for the Hyron Core Fight.\n\nOther Notes\nFor old-time fans of the original Deus Ex, this game has seemed to be polarizing due to its major differences between the original game and this piece of the continuity. While I cannot give a proper opinion yet as I haven't had the chance to fully play the classic and compare the two fairly, this should be taken in consideration. In my opinion, Human Revolution on its own merit has earned some credit despite a few issues such as some cut content.\n\nPersonally, I am looking forward to see what Deus Ex: Mankind Divided has to offer into the scene.","April 7","true","99.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Personally I didn’t see much difference from when I first played the original version a few years back. DE:HR is similar to the Hitman games because it seems like “smart” players would have a lot more fun. I usually like to run and gun so I don’t really look for different ways to exploit the environment in a game (like tricking an enemy into a room and gassing him).\n\nThe story of DE:HR is pretty complex and if you read all the literature in the game you’ll probably spend about 30+ hours on a single playthrough. In the near future, prosthetic technology (like artificial limbs) has become very advanced and widespread. In fact it’s become so advanced that most people with “augments” are getting them by choice. Basically they’re just upgrading themselves in a bunch of different ways. This is leading to a huge conflict between people who think augmentation should be outlawed to preserve humanity, and people who think augmentation is the next step in human evolution. And of course it also turns out that the military is creating augmented super soldiers. You play as Adam Jensen, a corporate security chief who gets augmented “against his will” after nearly dying in an attack (kind of like Robocop). The game is all about hunting down the people responsible while the world tears itself apart around you.\n\nThe game is mostly stealth although there are a ton of different ways to kill people (sniping, rocket launchers, machine guns). Your augments give you various advantages such as seeing / punching through walls and hacking devices (you’ll spend a large percentage of the game doing the hacking minigame). I’m trying to get the Pacifist achievement this playthrough, so I’m using only non-lethal takedowns and hiding the bodies while working my way through the story. That probably adds about 5 hours to the game time though, so if you’re impatient just blast your way through and leave the corpses. I believe the game averages 25 hours to beat so if you bought this game in the recent Humble Bundle you’ll definitely get your money’s worth.\n\nPros:\nExcellent stealth game. You can play through the entire game and not kill anyone (except bosses). I tried playing a non-lethal runthrough but must have killed someone accidently because I didn’t get the achievement.\nExcellent story - the highlight of the game.\nVery cheap game, I traded 1 TF2 key for it when it was part of the recent Square Enix Humble Bundle.\n\nCons:\nKind of dated graphics. The game came out in 2011 and really it doesn’t look much better than Half Life 2 (which came out 2004).\nThere really isn’t much use for money in this game other than a few times when you buy upgrades. I ended the game with like 80k credits and nothing to spend them on. Inventory space is limited so I couldn’t just load up on ammo.\nIf you do not like stealth games, don’t play this! It’s a large download (more than 10gb) and you might just hate it anyways. If you try to Rambo your way through you’ll get shot down pretty fast.\nI don’t really care for the way the “Missing Link” DLC was integrated into the game. I understand there wasn’t any other way to do it, but it’s jarring when it happens. The Missing Link was a DLC that was “standalone” which means you don’t share the save files from the regular Deus Ex HR. When you start Missing Link, you have no skill points and no weapons. In the Director’s Cut, this is a problem because when you reach that point in the story, you lose all your skills (including the skills that expand your inventory so half your loot drops on the floor).\n\nOverall, Deus Ex: HR is a definite Must Play if you don’t mind stealth. The graphics can be a little dated compared to modern games but it’s really all about the story. I’ve heard that they might be making a movie based on the game, and I can certainly see that happening. You hear about movies based on games all the time and mostly they’re bad ideas because video games are all about interactivity and accomplishment. A movie based on an awesome game like Bioshock Infinite would be like watching your brother play the game and he doesn’t let you play. Deus Ex on the other hand has such a rich backstory and realistic premise that a movie would tell the story wonderfully. I can totally foresee cybernetic augmentation as being a real world hot topic in the not so distant future.\n","August 27, 2014","true","44.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/238010/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","Deus Ex is a cyberpunk-themed, action-adventure sci-fi game developed by Eidos. It is an FPS but shows our character from the third-person perspective once behind a cover. The game, thus, puts a lot of emphasis on stealth-based approach taking down enemies one by one without allowing them to see us. The more silent approach you pick the more experience point you obtain after a successful takedown, therefore, the easier to level up. Once at a new level you can spent your hard-earned Praxis points on various skills further enhancing your capabilities: you can learn taking down enemies by smashing through walls, you can run and jump almost silently or if you want you can just become invisible for a short period of time.\n\nThere are two areas where Deux Ex shines:\n1) Story: You need to find out why Sarif Industries, the world's leading nanotechnology firm was attacked by an unknown group of mercenaries. You look for clues in Detroit and overseas in China, Singapore and even Australia. Each city offers a lot of side missions for you to further develop your skills and to get to know more of the story or just the world Deux Ex takes place in. It is common that you can make a decision as to how you want to accomplish a mission: if the requests are coming from more people you can decide who you'll favour eventually. There are collectibles in the form of e-books providing you with further background of the year 2027.\n2) Gameplay: As mentioned, while running and gunning is also an option the game is best played by picking the silent approach: each section offers extra bonus if you do not eliminate anyone and if nobody sees you coming. I also liked the hacking sequences - I hacked each and every panel in the game even when Jensen was in possession of the code to unlock a specific door or to turn off the turrets aimed to protect a certain area.\n\nNow, the Director's Cut is a newer version and has been available for a while instead of the vanilla edition. It comes bundled with the game's DLC and offers some graphics and AI improvements. As you can see from the store page patches were released as the DR version suffered from some pretty annoying bugs. Personally, I did not encounter any of these and I liked how they changed the boss battles in favour of those who decided to remain silent assassins throughout the game. The Director's Cut employs more vivid colours - I can understand this irritates some people. We have some documentary videos, audio commentaries and the good old new game plus mode which is so famous nowadays.\n\nOverall, I was satisfied with Deus Ex and with the Director's Cut I completed the game 3 times. That's 3 times 30-35 hours if you complete all side-missions and talk to everybody and explore every corner just to see if there are some extra equipment or Praxis Kits lying around. What's more is that the game offers 4 endings but in order to be able to see all of them you need to complete a lot of missions in the last segment of the game.\n\nIf you want a story-oriented, long-lasting cyberpunk experience then Deux Ex is for you. With the Director's Cut coupled with a discounted price you cannot make the wrong decision by purchasing Human Revolution.","March 23, 2014","true","72.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

One of my favorite anime - Ghost in the Shell, and one of my favorite movies - Blade Runner, it's no surprise that I appear a big fan of this series of games. Here it is possible to feel oppressive and depressing atmosphere of the future, filled with dark secrets and war corporations. The game world is saturated with dirt and despair, as part of the story is a good detective story. Unfortunately GOTY edition contains technical errors, and they can interfere with the normal game. But if you omit them, and minor flaws in the gameplay, you get a great role-playing game in the entourage of cyberpunk with interesting dialogue, ambiguous moral choices and entertaining storyline.","June 15, 2014","true","37.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Exploration is fun and rewarding. Every situation can be solved in more than one way. And honestly, I can think of plenty more pros. It just has so much going for it.\n\nThe only real complaint I have with the game is the poorly balanced skill tree. There are several skills that are just completely worthless (countdown timer) and others which are super essential (cloaking). It doesn't feel balanced in the slightest, but not everything can be perfect. And if that's the only bad thing this tough critic can say about it, then it's pretty damn good.","January 9","true","37.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Hell, even the name has a certain ring to it that makes it sound so imposing.\nI immediately fell in-love with the story.\nI love how you have choices about how you'd go about your mission, choices about Adam's augmentations, choices about what weaponry you carry with you and what upgrades you put in it, and choices about what to say.\nI loved how even with all the augmentations you have, you'd still be vulnerable and mortal.\nI loved how the Side missions unfolded, i loved the not so hidden pieces of lore and secret areas where you find free praxis kits and of course the END of it all.\n\nIt accomplishes what it set out to do in my opinion. Tell a gripping story, engage the player and show me what being human truly means when you are now thrust into a world where man becomes half machine. A vision of what might be in the far future and a sort of warning to those with the intellect to make augmentations in the future. Traditional morality and humanity fight a seemingly hopeless battle against the lust for power and the darker side of technological advancement. Absolutely gripping.\n\nI have some qualms about it though:\n\n-The citizens don't seem to feel believeable, its like they're generic NPC's. This disappointed me because of all the technological advances in gaming, they could not make it feel like i was in a techno centric world filled with interesting randomly generated NPC's.\n\n-I keep hearing about harvesters in-game. They apparently take augmentations from people and sell them, literally ripping and harvesting them off people. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO EPIC TO FIND AND FIGHT OFF HARVESTERS.\nSomething like "The more you get aug'd the more they'd come after you" kind of thing.\n\n-For an augmented person, Adam Jensen's movements were quite stiff. Minor issue but an issue nonetheless.\n\n-I feel that this would have been great if you could choose to shift between third person and first person view. WAIT. Hear me out. I know the deus ex games have always been FPS games. Sure. But look at Fallout 3 and New Vegas, the ability to choose makes a lot of difference. I'm the kind of guy who likes to see his character do some cool ♥♥♥♥ and sometimes i'm in the mood to see it in first person so i feel truly immersed. To each his own but yeah you get the point.\n\nAll in all, this game is something you must play. Period.\nDamn, if you feel like the price is steep, wait for the sales. But the Devs deserve the money so buy it even if it isn't on sale.\nI give this game a solid 9.5/10. If this game was a chick, i'd totally bang her.\nIn all seriousness, get the game, play it, play it again afterwards. and again and again and again.\n\nAnd again and again and again until augmentations become available to the general populace and then you get to live the game.","January 27, 2014","true","32.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Now you have to find all the preorder weapons in the world, and the Missing Link is fully encorporated into the main game.\n\nNot only that but they added a few interesting new features. Boss battles have been reworked inorder to allow for multiple ways to kill them. Such as hacking turrets, allowing for non-lethal and stealthier players to get past those sections. As well they added New Game Plus and Developer's Commentary. Allowing just enough content justification to warrant another playthrough.\n\nWhether it's worth your extra money remains to be seen.

A game that I love for a multitude of reasons. But as per usual, I want to quickly place a little disclaimer for those planning to buy this game with a LOW-END PC. You'll be able to run this game perfectly well with no issues. Maybe 720p or hell, native resolutions. My old laptop didn't pass the minimum requirements (it had a 1.8GHz Dual Core CPU) and it ran the game with 30FPS at it's native resolution (1366x768) with minor slowdowns at times.\nBut the game is well optimized and not really a bother in that department so don't worry about that.\n\nNow. Let's get into the meat of this review.\nDeus Ex Human Revolution is the prequel to 2000's Deus Ex. There were no other sequels (Don't mention the Fall or Invisible War, they don't count in my book) and it plays out the story of Adam Jensen. A former SWAT member that got ''kicked'' out of the team for taking part in the Mexican Town Massacre. This leads to Adam becoming the head of Security at Sarif Industries. Recommended to David Sarif by his ex-girlfriend, Megan Reed. I'm not going to spoil much of the story as the game's story is a brilliantly crafted experience.\n\nThe gameplay\n\nIt works and is easier to understand than 2000's Deus Ex in my opinion, but then again, I'm an idiot and took me a while to understand Deus Ex (2000)'s UI. The gameplay has been a bit simplified but the enemy AI is quite dumb at times but are accurate. There is infact Health Regeneration (which is meh in my opinion when it is done wrong which means that you're basically immortal), but it only heals you after a battle so you don't worry about running around looking for Medpacks, but that means that Devs can skimp over the level and not have to bother with Health Packs. The gameplay let's you do the usual ''Play it your way'' that most Stealth games let you. I'm calling this a stealth game as the game rewards you more for stealth rather than the original rewarding you equally for any sort of playstyle. The controls feel quite fluid in my opinion as it worked well. At first it was a bit awkward but then it became easier for me to play and was easier to see why they chose the default keymappings as they were. I also recommend having a 5-button (or more buttons) mouse due to the fact that the Augs themselves are mapped to F1-F4 like the original, but at times, it's easier to just press a sidebutton on your mouse to activate the Stealth Cloak Augmentation or the Smart Vision Augmentation.\n\nThe Audio\n\nThe OST itself is a brilliant one with tracks that consistently fit the mood of the area or situation you're in. The main menu track itself is a beautiful one that brings joy to me each time I boot up the game.\nThe opening theme itself, named ''Icarus'' is amazing to listen to in both in game and outside the game.\nEither way: The OST is lovely and awesome. That's always a plus in my opinion.\n\nEnviroments and Levels\n\nThe game will often recycle areas but for reasons within the story, you'll go to Detroit and Hengsha twice. But that doesn't mean that the game is just being cheap and making it seem awkward. It's just reusing the same areas but with some sort of reasoning within the story and has some new areas to explore or new side missions to play around with, or even a new bunch of characters or existing characters that have new interactions with for your past actions.\nThe enviroments seem realistic and yet futuristic. Most areas have atleast two or three ways of traversing around or fighting your enemies. The thing I hate about the areas and gameplay is that you can camp in the vents and just pick off the enemies one by one which makes it a giant camp fest if you're not bothered to try thinking to defeeat your enemies.\n\nWell, in my personal opinion, you should most definitely play this title for all the positives. And the Boss Battles are reimagined so they're not giant turds like they were in the original version of this game.. BUT this game has more glitches. (none that I encountered but some others have)","June 22, 2014","true","62.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The story doesn't make sence in the Deus Ex universe as apparently it takes place before the original Deus Ex, and yet all the augmentations are years ahead what we saw in the original game. It's not bad if you don't consider the older games though. The characters are interesting, and the quests are far from being boring. Moreover, the audiovisuals are great! But the style changed and black and gold dominate now what was blue and dark in the old games. Unfortunately, the combat system is terrible and a real nuisance. Every fight I thought how much of a better game it would be if there was less of it. Then I encountered bosses and asked myself what were the developers thinking, putting a Final Fantasy crap in Deus Ex. You cannot avoid combat with bosses, because fk yu. Fortunately you can stealth your way through other encounters, which is more fun and - on hard difficulties - sometimes quite challenging. Overall, it's a very good game save for combat, which holds me from replaying it.

At what point does someone stop being a person and start being a machine? Will the human being ever be 'upgradable' and what happens when those upgrades are rendered obsolete? Deus Ex 3 puts these questions to the player all whilst providing a roller-coaster of a gaming experience.\n\nDeus Ex 3: Human Revolution is a Cyberpunk First-Person Shooter / Role Playing Game with a heavy emphasis on Stealth, thinking through problems and giving the player enough different ways to solve those problems.\n\nThe year is 2027. You play as Adam Jensen, Chief of Security at one of the largest biotechnology corporations in the United States. On the evening your girlfriend is about to make a speech that will change the face of biotechnology forever, your headquarters comes under attack from an unknown force. From here on, Adam will be, in traditional Deus Ex fashion, thrown into a world of secret dealings, sinister plots and corporate espionage.\n\nFor a first game from a new studio, what they have done here is absolutely amazing. Eidos Montreal took a look at what made Deus Ex such a phenomenal game, what made Deus Ex 2 a controversial game for the fans of the original, and they've managed to create a game that not only feels like a Deus Ex game down to its core, but also modernizes the mechanics with amazing polish and care.\n\nThe story is very nicely written and well paced. Since the game is set in the year 2027 and the way our technology is progressing, the story has a very real and 'close to home' feeling that the human race could well have to deal with some of the issues that Human Revolution portrays regarding biotechnology and the ability for humans to control their own evolutionary path. It's very clear that the team behind the game have been researching heavily on where biotechnology currently is and where it is going, they use terminology that you may have never heard of before but it just helps to add to this amazingly built world which they have created.\n\nThe game also has a visually unique art style. The settings and costume design for characters is like nothing anyone has really seen in a game before. Don't think however that Eidos Montreal have sacrificed game play over aesthetics, this game is amazing to play.\n\nThe only way to Game Over in this game is, like all Deus Ex games, when you die. There is no wrong path to take and your decisions will stay with you throughout your entire experience. This has been a staple through the series and Deus Ex 3 does it no differently.\n\nThe stealth in the game is cover based. I've never been much of a fan of cover-based stealth games but Deus Ex 3 does the mechanic so well, I had no problems adapting. All the levels and the AI are so well thought and planned out, you'll be ducking and rolling between guard paths with ease in no time. Every level has enough chest-high walls, ventilation shafts and general cover that stealth is a viable option throughout the entire game.\n\nThe levels are huge in size with lots of hidden elements to find and lots of areas to explore. Finding most of them is rewarded with Experience Points which don't contribute to a 'level' but a Praxis Kit instead. Praxis Kits can be used to upgrade and switch on your augmentations. Augmentations that will allow you to take down multiple enemies at once, turn invisible, drop from any height without taking damage and even punch through walls!\n\nThe Director's Cut also includes the Missing Link Downloadable Content which is at least an extra 6 hours of game play. It is nicely woven into the original experience and will force you to make some very tough decisions. The outcome of the DLC doesn't really affect the outcome of the overall game but it is still quite entertaining to play.\n\nFor all the things Deus Ex 3 gets right, its fault are largely centred around its boss battles. For the Director's Cut, they have been opened up to allow people with different play styles to have a better chance of beating them. Unfortunately, they seem to suffer from being inconsistent; one boss battle took me 5 attempts to beat in which I only won because the boss ended up killing themselves with a badly thrown grenade. One boss I killed with the Stun Gun of all things and one boss even conveniently managed to kill themselves when I was running in the opposite direction and not even firing at it.\n\nDon't let the boss battles put you off playing though. This is a smart and powerful game with powerful messages behind it. I was hooked right until the very end and seeing a world crafted with such love and attention to detail made me all the more sad when the experience was over. Oh well.. there is always 'New Game +' to play!\n\nGet this game and play it your way!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Krawna/recommended/238010/","Krawna","furtive","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Krawna/","73 products in account","[This an elaborate/analytical review from the perspective of Deus Ex 1. If you haven't played DX1, don't read the following - just buy the game, you'll absolutely love it]\n\nSeems like Eidos Montreal decided they could never equal or better the first game, and given the colossal mess that was DX2, they made DX3 a tribute to the first, instead of an independent prequel. The number of similarities to DX1 are overwhelming, and so many elements are copy-pasted that as a die-hard DX1 fan, it makes for a bittersweet experience; it's a reminiscent mashup of things most people love: DX1 + Batman + or other games, yet it lacks depth and originality.\n\nDeus Ex\nAdam Jenson from DX3 and JC Denton from DX1. Same syllables in name. If that sounds like a silly similarity, relax, I'm just easing you in. The list is endless: [spoilers] being captured, getting set free by an anonymous hacker, your pilot's chopper gets blown but you had a chance to prevent that fate, ladies-restroom scene, identical ending choices; Illuminati; Dark Age; "Merge and Rule," conspiracy theories, Francis - your hacker colleague. Even the so called "Purity First" group look like a graphically enhanced version of NSF personnel\n\nBatman\nThe original DX3 was orange/gold bearing a stark resemblance to the general theme of the movie The Dark Knight. They went overboard with that, but normalized it in the Director's Cut edition. If you pay close attention to the Detroit music, there is that famous intro theme to Batman TAS, which I'm surprised they would throw in there and expect to get away with it. Moreover, a lot of people have even commented that Adam Jenson talks like Batman; you know, that unique half-breathing, half-speaking way of talking.\n\nHints of other games\nI was reminded of Metal Gear Solid even before the mission on the ship. Hiding behind corners, dragging bodies around. There were times I felt wanting to "knock" on the wall to divert the attention of enemies (a feature of MGS Sons of Liberty, and I haven't played that game in a decade). There is even one scene that screams of Half-Life.\n\nPros\nThe hacking mini-game is a terrific change, Typhoon augmentation, tons of "easter eggs," holstering your weapon, overall the music is very cinematic and atmospheric, with cultural influences too such as the zhong-hu instrument in "Hengsha LIMB Clinic", and vending machines are finally made useful, environments are much more "fuller" than doors/vents on an empty canvass, different ammo takes up inventory space (instead of one kind of ammo for everything), which is realistic. There is still a lot of detail in the world, which is great as it makes the world immersive. Critical conversations actually require you to listen to the other person, analyze their personality, and at times even their body language, which is brilliant.\n\nCons\nBut 13 years have passed since DX1 but the AI still says, "huh, what? nevermind I'm hearing things" after you drop something in front of their face and successfully hide. I threw 5 cartons on top of several open cubicles at a police station and everyone only said, "what was that?" and got "suspicious." This even goes for sound. Takedowns don't alert an enemy standing 2 feet away, even when the person you're taking down squeals. I felt that was weak. Any alarmed state can be nullified if you simply "walk away" from the scene, which is manipulative it becomes unfun, and I think is an element largely influenced from the batman games. Of all the games whose AI they imitated, if only they would have sampled Metal Gear Solid\n\nDX1 broke boundaries, was The "Revolution." DX3 is just a revision of the first, and a concoction of things that all gamers would love. It's unfortunate that Warren Spector was excised from the DX3 project by Eidos Montreal. Silly how the world works, doesn't it? He made a mind-blowing blockbuster of a game (DX1), but DX2 fell short of that standard, therefore he was boycotted. Cruel, given that he was the main brain behind this whole series, how could you leave such a man out completely? If DX3 has a 9/10 rating, then relatively DX1 should be 11/10. Eidos played it safe when making this prequel, and I guess you can't blame them. Not everyone can improve on perfection, but many can merely honor or mimic it, which is precisely what they've done","July 4, 2014","true","53.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The whole game connects to you because you are special. I am not giving any spoilers so find out yourself. But sometimes it can be confusing because there is so much detail and miscellaneous things. You should focus on the main problem and the main story. Of course there is side quests which give more experince points and some information about the main quest but you don't have to do those in order to complete the game.

To go guns a blazing or to be a ghost seen by none. Often the way it is done is so obvious that the illusion of choice is broken. This is where this game shines. I was able to play the way I wanted to throughout. If I wanted to sneak around and crawl through grates to get through to the room I wanted I could. If I wanted to speak to someone and convince them to let me in, more often than not, I could. If I wanted to hack the door to let me in undetected I could. Those are only some of the ways that the developers  employ  in progressing through the game. There are some drawbacks however. During the bossfights you would have to exercise some sort of violence against your enemies. Otherwise, this game was a lot of fun. It wasn't just a polarizing good or bad story line but it felt like I could really choose my own path in this cyber punk world. This inlcludes the leveling system. No matter which way you go you'll find that there is no bad power.

DEUS EX !!!\n\nFortunately, the massive hype surrounding 2011’s “Deus Ex: Human Revolution” was matched by an equally outstanding game. With its beautifully-realized cyberpunk world; stealth gameplay that rivaled top-shelf espionage titles; enough conspiracy theories to shake a tin foil hat at; and, best of all, its return to the “play how you want” formula that made the first game so good, “Human Revolution” was a success.\n\nDespite its brilliance, “Human Revolution” was far from perfect, bogged down by unfairly difficult boss battles that were skewed towards specific play styles, the occasional bland texture, and sometimes wonky enemy A.I. The Updated Version of this game "Director's Cut" has solved these problems and polished the game so much more.\n\nThe main complaint of the game, to date, is its color choice while looking through Adam Jensen's augmented visor. A hew of yellow coats the screen. Acourse this can easily be solved with any one of the many many graphic mods for this game revealing it's true colors. The color choice, for me, was never an issue.\n\nWith its flowing, open approach to mission structure, thoroughly engrossing story and gorgeous visuals, this is the kind of game that all others should strive to be. While there are some elements that don't feel quite as developed as they should have been, and augmentation is more Hobson's choice than true choice, Human Revolution provides a level of quality that only the most adamant cynic could fail to be impressed by.

Biggest changes in DC is the fact that boss fights are doable pretty much by hacking. There is still no non-lethal way to beat the bosses like in Metal Gear games, but that's not such a big deal. Also new game+ and developer commentary are great added features. On lower difficulties than "Give me Deus Ex" the game is now slightly easier, because two energy bars get charged automatically. The energy system is still flawed, but at least it's now a bit more fun when you can combo stealth cloak in to double takedown in every situation.\n\nThere aren't that many "pure" cyberpunk games around (there are some cyberpunk elements in a loooot of games), so the scenery is very refreshing. The world Eidos Montreal has created is very believable and the characters from their looks to dialog are great.\n\nThat's on my short 2 cents on DE: HR Director's Cut.","November 30, 2013","true","24.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

To go guns a blazing or to be a ghost seen by none. Often the way it is done is so obvious that the illusion of choice is broken. This is where this game shines. I was able to play the way I wanted to throughout. If I wanted to sneak around and crawl through grates to get through to the room I wanted I could. If I wanted to speak to someone and convince them to let me in, more often than not, I could. If I wanted to hack the door to let me in undetected I could. Those are only some of the ways that the developers  employ  in progressing through the game. There are some drawbacks however. During the bossfights you would have to exercise some sort of violence against your enemies. Otherwise, this game was a lot of fun. It wasn't just a polarizing good or bad story line but it felt like I could really choose my own path in this cyber punk world. This inlcludes the leveling system. No matter which way you go you'll find that there is no bad power.

DEUS EX !!!\n\nFortunately, the massive hype surrounding 2011’s “Deus Ex: Human Revolution” was matched by an equally outstanding game. With its beautifully-realized cyberpunk world; stealth gameplay that rivaled top-shelf espionage titles; enough conspiracy theories to shake a tin foil hat at; and, best of all, its return to the “play how you want” formula that made the first game so good, “Human Revolution” was a success.\n\nDespite its brilliance, “Human Revolution” was far from perfect, bogged down by unfairly difficult boss battles that were skewed towards specific play styles, the occasional bland texture, and sometimes wonky enemy A.I. The Updated Version of this game "Director's Cut" has solved these problems and polished the game so much more.\n\nThe main complaint of the game, to date, is its color choice while looking through Adam Jensen's augmented visor. A hew of yellow coats the screen. Acourse this can easily be solved with any one of the many many graphic mods for this game revealing it's true colors. The color choice, for me, was never an issue.\n\nWith its flowing, open approach to mission structure, thoroughly engrossing story and gorgeous visuals, this is the kind of game that all others should strive to be. While there are some elements that don't feel quite as developed as they should have been, and augmentation is more Hobson's choice than true choice, Human Revolution provides a level of quality that only the most adamant cynic could fail to be impressed by. More importantly, it is everything a fan of Deus Ex could want in a game.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who loves Si-fi worlds and rpg based games. A "Must Play" game for sure.\n\n- XeroSyphon","December 27, 2013","true","189.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I suggest trying to hack as much as possible to gain all the bonuses. Eidos Montreal can't for the life of them create a map display that is easy to understand & navigate, they should outsource mapping to a different studio imo. This game to me was a worthwhile experience from start to finish, which I never asked for this.\nDeus Ex: Human Revolution - Directors Cut has my recommendation.","March 25, 2015","true","27.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a FPS RPG set in the future where cybernetic augmentations have created a rift between the people in society who can afford them and those who can't. You play as Adam Jensen, a bad ♥♥♥.\n\nPros:\n+ Level design(except bosses): Human Revolution's levels and maps are ridiculously flexible, as there are hundreds of ways to go through the levels. You can sneak past everyone, not harming a soul, or leap in, guns blazing. I've seen a video on Youtube where someone went through the whole game with nothing but a box as a weapon, throwing it to deal damage.\n+ DLC: The DLC is integrated into the game - I didn't even realize it wasn't part of the regular game.\n+ Gameplay: There are many kinds of guns and many mods for those guns, which allows you to supplement your chosen playstyle with your preferred weapon(s). You are also offered "augmentations", or, in other terms, a skill tree. These can significantly affect playstyle, as you can leap higher or take no fall damage, punch or see through walls, shoot rockets, take less damage, etc. There are also parts of the game where you talk to people. These scenes are relatively fluid, as you choose your dialogue options in an attempt to persuade or interrogate. It is very similar to an actual, real life conversation.\n+ Story: Your typical action-packed conspiracy theory rich Deus Ex story.\n\nCons:\n- Uneven FPS(maybe just my problem)\n- The graphic aren't very good, but the cutscenes look nice.\n- Boss battles: "Boss" battles are a pain in the ♥♥♥, as it forces you to go "guns blazing" playstyle and feels out of place.\nI can add more to this list, but that would be nitpicking an otherwise solid game.\n\nI rate this game 7.25/10 - recommended to just about anybody.","November 1, 2015","true","27.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It helped me see things different and finally I could be in a universe which really interest me: our world. I believe that this game shows the truth. The fate of mankind both in the present days and in the future.\n\nThis version includes all the extra content you can get, the Missing Link DLC (see below) and many hours of developers' commentar. I played through the regular version in 24 hours, while this one took more than 40. Worth the extra money?\nDefinitely!\n\nBut don't worry, I'm not going to chant odes about how great this game is, simply because it isn't. From a technical perspective, mostly.\nFirst of all, this Director's Cut version uses an older build of the game, so the many bugs they fixed in the normal version are still present. These include graphical issues, like presented here, here, here, and here.  The character animations - especially during dialogues - are also ugly, and it seems they forgot mimics too. Although they said they had a lot technological limitations, it's a shame considering it came out in 2011. I found one npc fail as well. Also, I had problems with getting a decent fps. It dropped many times below the playeable limit. It was nice to see how they improved the visuals in the DLC. It was stunning . The "improved AI" as they promoted is still dumb as a rock. Once you get into a fight they can hunt you down, but as far as you prefer stealthing, they're easy to fool. Too easy.\n\nOther than these, it's an outstanding piece of art.\nAs I listened the developers I kinda realized how much effort they've put into this game. Level designers, voice actors, story writers, everybody did an honest and dedicated job.\nThe story, is by far the most complex and well-written I have seen. It always keeps the tension, has many twists and makes you play more only to see what'll happen next. They hit the nail on the head with this cyber-renessaince design. It fits very well to the atmosphere. I mean, it creates the atmosphere. A dark near future world full of transhumanist aspirations and the contrary between technologycal advancement and human dignity. Takedown animations are badass, the weapon arsenal is diverse, the stealth mechanics works as well as combat situations. There are plenty of ways how you can achieve your goal. I discovered many (and I mean MANY) other alternate routes for the second playthrough.\n\nOne very important thing I can not go past without a word is the music. Michael McCann is an amazing talent, his melodies define my every day life. I listen to this album regularly, and yet\nI can not get enough of it. It's a masteriece.\n\nTo sum up this review, you must really play this game if you're interested in the topics mentioned above. It worth every minute you spend with it.

Terrible bossfights used to be it's downside but now it's completelly rewamped and allows you to kill bosses with bit more of variety.

As much as he tries to look like a victim his augments makes him BAMF.

I suggest trying to hack as much as possible to gain all the bonuses. Eidos Montreal can't for the life of them create a map display that is easy to understand & navigate, they should outsource mapping to a different studio imo. This game to me was a worthwhile experience from start to finish, which I never asked for this.\nDeus Ex: Human Revolution - Directors Cut has my recommendation.","March 25, 2015","true","27.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Invisible War was a mess. BUT, Human Revolution rejuvenated the franchise after returning to the core roots and pillars of gameplay which were founded in the original. Stealth, action, meaningful choice and consequence events, and of course many other role playing elements. Adam Jensen, ex-SWAT and military, is an awesome protagonist, and is easily one of the franchises best characters, just as JC Denton was in the first game. Augmentations are back, and are as awesome as ever. These give Adam a slick feel, especially as time progresses, and allows endless possibilities with character development. Augmentations give the player new avenues into approaching objectives which allows the game to feel more open ended and replayable.BE WARNED, not all augmentations can be purchased in one playthrough so choose wisely depending on your playstyle.5th time playing it myself (1st time on PC), and I was still discovering new and rewarding approaches to tackle my objectives. The dialogue system, which is very similar to Mass Effect, works extremely well in giving the player more choice and is intricately designed, much like the new hacking system. As far as the story goes, it absolutely works with the themes of the game. Conspiracies, secret organisations and of course...the Illuminati. And not to mention, the writing in the game is impeccable. One of the best scripts I've seen in a video game.\n\nThe "Directors Cut" tag has added quite a few benefits over the original, the most noticeable being the New Game+ mode which was widely requested by fans for a long time. It's here and it absolutely works. Being able to continue on from where the game ended and keeping all augmentations just makes the game more enjoyable and also a little bit easier, allowing the "Give me Deus Ex" difficulty to be quite manageable, as it is very tough (1 or 2 hits and its "See ya later, Frank"). Only weapons and other inventory items will have been discarded if New Game+ is activated, which is not a very big hassle as it would have made the game way too easy, and that is not at all good for a game like this. The new "Directors Cut" also adds developer commentary which is quite insightful as it delves deeper into how different aspects of the game were considered and made.\n\nIn conclusion, Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Directors Cut is one of last generation’s best games, in MY OPINION. The rewarding gameplay, multiple approaches to objectives, and just the sheer amount of replayability along with the engaging and well written 20+ hour storyline makes for an extremely enjoyable and immersive experience, especially for fans of the franchise, like myself. The only downsides, which I haven't yet mentioned have to be that the game only rewards one approach of gameplay, stealth and non-lethal, which is actually fine because ultimately this is how Deus Ex should be played, and it’s the way I played it. The other disappointment is in the boss fights. Although the "Directors Cut" added more flexibility to these encounters, they still lacked in the multiple approach department, especially taking these bosses down non-lethally, which isn't very much like Deus Ex. Lastly, the inclusion of the "Missing Link" DLC, adds to the games total play time, but nothing more as it is quite a disappointment. The "Missing Link" should not have been embedded into the main game, as it seems rather forced due to the tedious objectives that need to be completed in a constricted hub, which ultimately results in rather stale and boring gameplay. All in all, I wish I could go over everything, but this was a short review. Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Directors Cut is one hell of a game and can easily be respected as one of the series' best. Hardcore fan or newcomer, this game should be played by anyone who enjoys lasting and rewarding RPG's. Having played the PC and console version, the PC version is far superior.\n\n9.2/10\n\nNote: I managed to do everything in the game, including most achievements and the DLC, in around 17 hours (speedrun, kinda). If it is your FIRST time playing the game, expect to put in at least 30-35 hours to finish the story and do some of the side quests. I just memorised MOST of the games layout and approaches, and also knew where the main interest locations were.","July 5, 2015","true","20.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a FPS RPG set in the future where cybernetic augmentations have created a rift between the people in society who can afford them and those who can't. You play as Adam Jensen, a bad ♥♥♥.\n\nPros:\n+ Level design(except bosses): Human Revolution's levels and maps are ridiculously flexible, as there are hundreds of ways to go through the levels. You can sneak past everyone, not harming a soul, or leap in, guns blazing. I've seen a video on Youtube where someone went through the whole game with nothing but a box as a weapon, throwing it to deal damage.\n+ DLC: The DLC is integrated into the game - I didn't even realize it wasn't part of the regular game.\n+ Gameplay: There are many kinds of guns and many mods for those guns, which allows you to supplement your chosen playstyle with your preferred weapon(s). You are also offered "augmentations", or, in other terms, a skill tree. These can significantly affect playstyle, as you can leap higher or take no fall damage, punch or see through walls, shoot rockets, take less damage, etc. There are also parts of the game where you talk to people. These scenes are relatively fluid, as you choose your dialogue options in an attempt to persuade or interrogate. It is very similar to an actual, real life conversation.\n+ Story: Your typical action-packed conspiracy theory rich Deus Ex story.\n\nCons:\n- Uneven FPS(maybe just my problem)\n- The graphic aren't very good, but the cutscenes look nice.\n- Boss battles: "Boss" battles are a pain in the ♥♥♥, as it forces you to go "guns blazing" playstyle and feels out of place.\nI can add more to this list, but that would be nitpicking an otherwise solid game.\n\nI rate this game 7.25/10 - recommended to just about anybody.","November 1, 2015","true","27.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is absolutely awesome. True you can go about killing everyone, but scarce ammo placement (again in higher difficulties), and harder enemies make stealth sometimes not just an option but a necessity. True, it can be a bit cumbersome trying to sneak around 8 guards without having them see or hear you, but that's what this game is all about - The challenge of remaining undetected.\n\nThe lack of Open world maps rather than separate parts that require loading (Eg.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tnhoff/recommended/238010/","tnhoff","TN Hoff","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tnhoff/","190 products in account","TL;DR:\n\nThis is an *excellent* game that I highly recommend - but the presence of a few bugs dents its otherwise gleaming presentation.  They are hardly dealbreakers and shouldn't stop you from giving this game a shot - but you should know about them before you dive in so you won't get surprised or disappointed.  Pick it up on sale and enjoy many hours of stylized clandestine cyberpunk fun.  I think you'll be glad you did.\n\nPSA WARNING:  Do not install the laser sight on the silenced sniper rifle!  You'll have a bad time.\n\n\nDetails:\n\nWhile I DO highly recommend this game, I can only really recommend it on sale - as it has a few fairly annoying little bugs.  The game itself is worth full price - but given that the game has run its course in terms of sales and given those bugs never saw a final patch, you'll get more satisfaction picking this one up at a discount.  This Director's Cut version is made from an older, unpatched version of the game (apparently the orignal source code was lost - ouch) and while it improves some graphics like textures and tesselation, adds a couple (really cool) weapons, and improves the boss fights, it leaves out some pretty important fixes - and NO - they will never be patched.  These bugs are by no means dealbreakers for me, but they are enough that I still wish they would have just patched them.  Let's talk about the two that bug me the most:\n\nStutter:  Any modern rig should be able to run this game smooth as butter all day, but many users including myself experience some pretty annoying lag / jitter /stutter.  Nvidia users seem to be able to fix this with a regedit tweak (multiple guides here on steam about that) - but most AMD users like myself seem out of luck here.  I've seen a few that have managed to solve the issue, but so far none of the fixes have solved the stuttering for me and my R9 280 3gb.  It isn't terrible - the game is totally playable - but a game this old just shouldn't have it.  (The game runs pretty consistently at 60 fps, but every couple seconds there are often micro-stutters / jitters in the flow of time that can be a little distracting.  It's minor, but noticable enough to irk me at times.)  The older (non directors cut) version patched this out - but for some reason, no patch ever came along for what is now the only version available on Steam.\n\nSniper Rifle Aiming Bug:  Find that super awesome silenced sniper rifle?  Read the item description that says a laser sight dramatically improves accuracy?  NOPE!  Installing the laser sight will essentially break the weapon - and you can't take it off.  (Luckily, there are a few opportunities to pick up another if you mess up your first one like I did.)  It offsets the scoped aiming reticule - the bullet will hit somewhere below the crosshair.  I have found no fix for this.  There's a warning about this on the Wiki, but I don't think most players will think to check there first.\n\nThere's also a small bug with the revolver in that the ironsights aren't aligned quite right - but in this case, a laser sight is actually very helpful: having the red dot negates the need for ironsights, and makes the weapon accurate from the hip.  Fully upgraded, it's a supremely fun weapon for causing chaos.  (EXPLODING BULLETS - AW YEA)  Shooty-boom-boom.\n\nOkay.  Ranting aside, this is a *fantastic* game that I have thoroughly enjoyed - and even with the one broken weapon and the fairly annoying stutter, I completely recommend playing through it - especially if you're the type of player that likes to investigate the details.  Taking the time to find / read everything really fleshes out the exeprience, and makes for a satisfyingly meaty game experience.  All the little emails, pda's, etc. really flesh-out the world they've created here, and it's fascinating.  The game was much longer, and with much more content than I expected from a 2010's first person game - and that was a refreshing surprise.  The gunplay is competent enough, and the weapons are super cool.  Most of those are upgradable in multiple ways - just like the original Deus Ex.  While dated nowadays, the graphics are good enough - certainly lightyears ahead of the orignal - and I really dig the art style.  The moody main character is a little angsty at times, but that's part of who he is.  Some games let you make your own character - but in this one, you step into the shoes of a person with a particular past who has been affected by it in a particular way - but you get to chose what happens from here.\n\nThe game allows for a varied approach to almost any situation, and provides multiple paths to get there - allowing the player to take advantage of various skills or upgrades.  You can hack, sneak, cloak, move through the sewers or across the rooftops - or just waltz right in the front door with machine guns and rocket launchers blazing.  Bosses aside, you can even go through the whole game without killing a soul (and get a hefty xp bonus in the process).\n\nThere are four possible endings - don't worry no spoilers here - and you essentially get to chose which one right at the end.  None of them are particularly awesome in their own right - pretty typical these days - but the game itself is so good, I ain't even mad.  (In my personal opinion, only one of the four sits well with me - but I guess that's the point of chosing!)  Now - I will say - this is one of those times where it's worth it to sit through the credits.  What would have been a slightly disappointing conclusion turns into one that sets up the next game (chronologically) and left me hyped for Deus Ex in general - and really tied the whole thing together - at least for me.\n\nPersonally, I think replay value is excellent - I just beat the game, and I'm jumping right back into New Game + on hard mode - and so far, am loving it even more the second time through.  (It's amazing what a lack of magical crosshair in the middle of the screen does for immersion.)  The variety of weapons and approaches the game offers really keeps things interesting.  While the endings themselves are multiple-choice at the end, there are various times in the game where choice / performance / path taken has an effect on the future - story and gameplay - which makes me want to go through again and try things different ways.  Lots of fun to be had here.\n\nThe people who made this game did so with a lot of passion, and it shows.  It's just a real shame that Eidos somehow lost the original source code leading to this slightly crippled final version of the game.  The Director's Cut does an otherwise great job of integrating the DLC content in a cohesive way, and I actually prefer the way it is integrated here vs having the orignal game plus the DLC.\n\nAll in all, this has become one of my favorites - flaws and all.","January 4","true","54.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

There are a wide range of skills which you can upgrade as the game progresses, a range of weapon choices and a multitude of side quests. Even if you try to rush the campaign it would likely take you well over 20 hours but once the story takes hold you'll find yourself completing every side quest you can find.

The Director's Cut is available, offering even more missions and options including stealth aspects to boss battles.\n\nYou can make choices as the game goes on and every choice matters, your skills will limit your choices too so depending how you upgrade will depend how the story plays out, offering multiple endings.

Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a FPS RPG set in the future where cybernetic augmentations have created a rift between the people in society who can afford them and those who can't. You play as Adam Jensen, a bad ♥♥♥.\n\nPros:\n+ Level design(except bosses): Human Revolution's levels and maps are ridiculously flexible, as there are hundreds of ways to go through the levels. You can sneak past everyone, not harming a soul, or leap in, guns blazing. I've seen a video on Youtube where someone went through the whole game with nothing but a box as a weapon, throwing it to deal damage.\n+ DLC: The DLC is integrated into the game - I didn't even realize it wasn't part of the regular game.\n+ Gameplay: There are many kinds of guns and many mods for those guns, which allows you to supplement your chosen playstyle with your preferred weapon(s). You are also offered "augmentations", or, in other terms, a skill tree. These can significantly affect playstyle, as you can leap higher or take no fall damage, punch or see through walls, shoot rockets, take less damage, etc. There are also parts of the game where you talk to people. These scenes are relatively fluid, as you choose your dialogue options in an attempt to persuade or interrogate. It is very similar to an actual, real life conversation.\n+ Story: Your typical action-packed conspiracy theory rich Deus Ex story.\n\nCons:\n- Uneven FPS(maybe just my problem)\n- The graphic aren't very good, but the cutscenes look nice.\n- Boss battles: "Boss" battles are a pain in the ♥♥♥, as it forces you to go "guns blazing" playstyle and feels out of place.\nI can add more to this list, but that would be nitpicking an otherwise solid game.\n\nI rate this game 7.25/10 - recommended to just about anybody.","November 1, 2015","true","27.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Except for the final boss fight, which you can beat in literally 10 seconds if you have the laser rifle. Nope, I'm not kidding. However, the flexibility this game allows you is quite amazing. You can take pretty much any path to beat the game, and there's so many side quests you probably won't ever beat the game. And if you open up the game, play the prologue, and think "this sucks", remember, the game normally has an ammo counter. Only issue besides the boss fight is that after you get  taken on the boat and strapped into the EMP chair	 in about chapter 15, you lose all of your weapons. Probably not a disaster if you had a 10mm pistol and a stun gun, but a bit more of a disaster if you had a laser sighted, tracking bullets, silenced, damage upgraded combat rifle, a laser-sight damage upgraded silenced armor piercing 10mm pistol, a silenced sniper rifle (which can only be found in one place to my knowledge), a grenade launcher (again, you  can only find it in one place) and a laser rifle with 600 ammo like I did.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tnhoff/recommended/238010/","tnhoff","TN Hoff","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tnhoff/","190 products in account","TL;DR:\n\nThis is an *excellent* game that I highly recommend - but the presence of a few bugs dents its otherwise gleaming presentation.  They are hardly dealbreakers and shouldn't stop you from giving this game a shot - but you should know about them before you dive in so you won't get surprised or disappointed.  Pick it up on sale and enjoy many hours of stylized clandestine cyberpunk fun.  I think you'll be glad you did.\n\nPSA WARNING:  Do not install the laser sight on the silenced sniper rifle!  You'll have a bad time.\n\n\nDetails:\n\nWhile I DO highly recommend this game, I can only really recommend it on sale - as it has a few fairly annoying little bugs.  The game itself is worth full price - but given that the game has run its course in terms of sales and given those bugs never saw a final patch, you'll get more satisfaction picking this one up at a discount.  This Director's Cut version is made from an older, unpatched version of the game (apparently the orignal source code was lost - ouch) and while it improves some graphics like textures and tesselation, adds a couple (really cool) weapons, and improves the boss fights, it leaves out some pretty important fixes - and NO - they will never be patched.  These bugs are by no means dealbreakers for me, but they are enough that I still wish they would have just patched them.  Let's talk about the two that bug me the most:\n\nStutter:  Any modern rig should be able to run this game smooth as butter all day, but many users including myself experience some pretty annoying lag / jitter /stutter.  Nvidia users seem to be able to fix this with a regedit tweak (multiple guides here on steam about that) - but most AMD users like myself seem out of luck here.  I've seen a few that have managed to solve the issue, but so far none of the fixes have solved the stuttering for me and my R9 280 3gb.  It isn't terrible - the game is totally playable - but a game this old just shouldn't have it.  (The game runs pretty consistently at 60 fps, but every couple seconds there are often micro-stutters / jitters in the flow of time that can be a little distracting.  It's minor, but noticable enough to irk me at times.)  The older (non directors cut) version patched this out - but for some reason, no patch ever came along for what is now the only version available on Steam.\n\nSniper Rifle Aiming Bug:  Find that super awesome silenced sniper rifle?  Read the item description that says a laser sight dramatically improves accuracy?  NOPE!  Installing the laser sight will essentially break the weapon - and you can't take it off.  (Luckily, there are a few opportunities to pick up another if you mess up your first one like I did.)  It offsets the scoped aiming reticule - the bullet will hit somewhere below the crosshair.  I have found no fix for this.  There's a warning about this on the Wiki, but I don't think most players will think to check there first.\n\nThere's also a small bug with the revolver in that the ironsights aren't aligned quite right - but in this case, a laser sight is actually very helpful: having the red dot negates the need for ironsights, and makes the weapon accurate from the hip.  Fully upgraded, it's a supremely fun weapon for causing chaos.  (EXPLODING BULLETS - AW YEA)  Shooty-boom-boom.\n\nOkay.  Ranting aside, this is a *fantastic* game that I have thoroughly enjoyed - and even with the one broken weapon and the fairly annoying stutter, I completely recommend playing through it - especially if you're the type of player that likes to investigate the details.  Taking the time to find / read everything really fleshes out the exeprience, and makes for a satisfyingly meaty game experience.  All the little emails, pda's, etc. really flesh-out the world they've created here, and it's fascinating.  The game was much longer, and with much more content than I expected from a 2010's first person game - and that was a refreshing surprise.  The gunplay is competent enough, and the weapons are super cool.  Most of those are upgradable in multiple ways - just like the original Deus Ex.  While dated nowadays, the graphics are good enough - certainly lightyears ahead of the orignal - and I really dig the art style.  The moody main character is a little angsty at times, but that's part of who he is.  Some games let you make your own character - but in this one, you step into the shoes of a person with a particular past who has been affected by it in a particular way - but you get to chose what happens from here.\n\nThe game allows for a varied approach to almost any situation, and provides multiple paths to get there - allowing the player to take advantage of various skills or upgrades.  You can hack, sneak, cloak, move through the sewers or across the rooftops - or just waltz right in the front door with machine guns and rocket launchers blazing.  Bosses aside, you can even go through the whole game without killing a soul (and get a hefty xp bonus in the process).\n\nThere are four possible endings - don't worry no spoilers here - and you essentially get to chose which one right at the end.  None of them are particularly awesome in their own right - pretty typical these days - but the game itself is so good, I ain't even mad.  (In my personal opinion, only one of the four sits well with me - but I guess that's the point of chosing!)  Now - I will say - this is one of those times where it's worth it to sit through the credits.  What would have been a slightly disappointing conclusion turns into one that sets up the next game (chronologically) and left me hyped for Deus Ex in general - and really tied the whole thing together - at least for me.\n\nPersonally, I think replay value is excellent - I just beat the game, and I'm jumping right back into New Game + on hard mode - and so far, am loving it even more the second time through.  (It's amazing what a lack of magical crosshair in the middle of the screen does for immersion.)  The variety of weapons and approaches the game offers really keeps things interesting.  While the endings themselves are multiple-choice at the end, there are various times in the game where choice / performance / path taken has an effect on the future - story and gameplay - which makes me want to go through again and try things different ways.  Lots of fun to be had here.\n\nThe people who made this game did so with a lot of passion, and it shows.  It's just a real shame that Eidos somehow lost the original source code leading to this slightly crippled final version of the game.  The Director's Cut does an otherwise great job of integrating the DLC content in a cohesive way, and I actually prefer the way it is integrated here vs having the orignal game plus the DLC.\n\nAll in all, this has become one of my favorites - flaws and all.","January 4","true","54.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Invisible War was a mess. BUT, Human Revolution rejuvenated the franchise after returning to the core roots and pillars of gameplay which were founded in the original. Stealth, action, meaningful choice and consequence events, and of course many other role playing elements. Adam Jensen, ex-SWAT and military, is an awesome protagonist, and is easily one of the franchises best characters, just as JC Denton was in the first game. Augmentations are back, and are as awesome as ever. These give Adam a slick feel, especially as time progresses, and allows endless possibilities with character development. Augmentations give the player new avenues into approaching objectives which allows the game to feel more open ended and replayable.BE WARNED, not all augmentations can be purchased in one playthrough so choose wisely depending on your playstyle.5th time playing it myself (1st time on PC), and I was still discovering new and rewarding approaches to tackle my objectives. The dialogue system, which is very similar to Mass Effect, works extremely well in giving the player more choice and is intricately designed, much like the new hacking system. As far as the story goes, it absolutely works with the themes of the game. Conspiracies, secret organisations and of course...the Illuminati. And not to mention, the writing in the game is impeccable. One of the best scripts I've seen in a video game.\n\nThe "Directors Cut" tag has added quite a few benefits over the original, the most noticeable being the New Game+ mode which was widely requested by fans for a long time. It's here and it absolutely works. Being able to continue on from where the game ended and keeping all augmentations just makes the game more enjoyable and also a little bit easier, allowing the "Give me Deus Ex" difficulty to be quite manageable, as it is very tough (1 or 2 hits and its "See ya later, Frank"). Only weapons and other inventory items will have been discarded if New Game+ is activated, which is not a very big hassle as it would have made the game way too easy, and that is not at all good for a game like this. The new "Directors Cut" also adds developer commentary which is quite insightful as it delves deeper into how different aspects of the game were considered and made.\n\nIn conclusion, Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Directors Cut is one of last generation’s best games, in MY OPINION. The rewarding gameplay, multiple approaches to objectives, and just the sheer amount of replayability along with the engaging and well written 20+ hour storyline makes for an extremely enjoyable and immersive experience, especially for fans of the franchise, like myself. The only downsides, which I haven't yet mentioned have to be that the game only rewards one approach of gameplay, stealth and non-lethal, which is actually fine because ultimately this is how Deus Ex should be played, and it’s the way I played it. The other disappointment is in the boss fights. Although the "Directors Cut" added more flexibility to these encounters, they still lacked in the multiple approach department, especially taking these bosses down non-lethally, which isn't very much like Deus Ex. Lastly, the inclusion of the "Missing Link" DLC, adds to the games total play time, but nothing more as it is quite a disappointment. The "Missing Link" should not have been embedded into the main game, as it seems rather forced due to the tedious objectives that need to be completed in a constricted hub, which ultimately results in rather stale and boring gameplay. All in all, I wish I could go over everything, but this was a short review. Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Directors Cut is one hell of a game and can easily be respected as one of the series' best. Hardcore fan or newcomer, this game should be played by anyone who enjoys lasting and rewarding RPG's. Having played the PC and console version, the PC version is far superior.\n\n9.2/10\n\nNote: I managed to do everything in the game, including most achievements and the DLC, in around 17 hours (speedrun, kinda). If it is your FIRST time playing the game, expect to put in at least 30-35 hours to finish the story and do some of the side quests. I just memorised MOST of the games layout and approaches, and also knew where the main interest locations were.","July 5, 2015","true","20.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Human Revolution is incredibly immersive; the enviroment is beautiful, the characters well rounded (even the side characters), and the story compelling (espeically if you take time to read the avaliable material and track down clues off the beaten path). The gameplay is fun, especially if you enjoy stealth games. The soundtrack is amazing; check out the cinematic trailer if you want a good example of this. If you're a stealth player, this game will really allow you to shine.\n\nThe bad: Human Revolution encourages you to take a stealth approach, which runs a little contrary to the prior Deus Ex games, in which multiple paths were equally rewarding. You get more in-game rewards for stealth and non-lethal approaches. I'd have liked to see a more balanced approach. Also under bad, the boss fights were developed by a different company, so they really don't fit the feel of the rest of the game.\n\nDirector's Cut specific notes: The Director's Cut attempted to fix the boss battles, and they are certainly much better than they were in prior versions; however, you still have to kill the bosses, which is jarring in the midst of a non-lethal run. Many people have experienced performance issues with the Director's Cut. Those with Nvidia graphics cards seem to experience more difficulty on the whole; however, a lot of it is down to your configuration. I'm running a Nvidia card in a laptop and I'm able to play the DC without any framerate or stuttering issues. However, your mileage may vary - something to be aware of.\n\nGeneral info: All of the DLCs available with the original Human Revolution have been integrated into the Director's Cut (except for the 10,000 credit bonus). The extra weapons are now available in-game as opposed to being dropped into your inventory from the beginning, and the Tong mission and Missing Link are both part of the story line.\n\nOverall: This is my favorite game, to be honest, and I would strongly recommend it to absolutely anyone. The story is great, and if you care to spend any time seriously contemplating it, can raise some interesting questions about technology and humanity. If you haven't played the Deus Ex games, do yourself a favor and play them ASAP.\n\nSystem Specs Used: Intel Core i7-3610QM, Nvidia GeForce GTX 670M / 3GB GDDR5, DDRIII 12GB RAM, Windows 7","December 31, 2014","true","61.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So I skipped these games...\n\n... and I got more than positively surprised, without knowing what I had to expect:\n\nThe gameplay with all his diversity is awesome. It's always your decision how you play (upseen from the boss fights). You can be a stone cold killer, a tactician, hacker or a sissy. That's also depending on the cool assorment of augmentations ("skills") from which you can choose.\n\nThe atmosphere/graphic/audio is amazing. You get literally drawn into the world of cyberpunk.

The game is set in a fully immersive new-age cyber-punk world.  This game is the third produced in the series but is actually the prequel to the first two games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brovah/recommended/238010/","Brovah","Brovah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brovah/","57 products in account",""I never asked for this"\n\nA lot like some of my other favorite games of all time Deus-Ex Human Revolution started out as one of those games I had heard of, but had never gotten why people loved them so much. I picked the game up along with the original and the two other games for around $7, a pretty good deal considering how amazing I consider this game to be.\n\nStory\n22 years in the future from right now mankind has created augmentations, essentially robotic limbs and prostetics, a field we are actually exploring right now for birth defects, veterans, and work place injuries. With the creation of more and more advanced augmentations the public starts to worry that with the steady increase of aug users, will people begin to abuse it? The actual game story (and not the backstory) starts after waking up from a 6 month coma, where you wake up heavily augmented as to save your life. You play as Adam Jensen, the head of security of Serif industries. After an attack on your company which was the cause of your coma, your new augmentations, and the supposed death of your girlfriend and 5 other scientists. As you systematically track down the perpetrators of the attack it leads you into an even bigger bunnyhole on a global scale.\n\nGameplay\nThe cover system and stealth mechanics feel a lot like the Metal Gear Solid series. With guards and enemies responding to every noise and thing they see. If you're jumping around trying to find a route past them, they're going to check it out. If you leave a body laying around by another guards patrol area they're going to call it in and raise the alarm. Actual combat is a bit lacking though, if you want to go all in and just shoot everything you're just going to get holes shot in you as you die in about 10 shots. Boss battles, (excluding the last one) are a bit lacking, as one battle just has you shoot the guy in the head and that's it. He taunts you for a good 30 minutes and once you get to him, bang, zoom, 6ft under. While silencers for your pistol and assault rifle are rather hard to find in the beginning, they come around later along with damage, reload, target seeking, lasers, armor piercing, and even magazine upgrades. You can even upgrade your augmentations to be able to carry more items (the inventory has a set size which is kind of BS), be able to punch through walls, be able to takedown multiple enemies, fire explosive ball bearings out of your chest and more.\n\nGraphics\nMy laptop is a bit ♥♥♥♥ but even as it was on my computer it looked pretty good for a game released 4 years ago. You can argue that Skyrim came out around the same time but that probably had a much bigger budget than this game.\n\nVerdict\nAmazing game, one of my favorite single player games along with Dishonored, Dead Space, and Wolfenstein. The game itself, and not the bundle, was on sale for less than 5$. If that discount ever comes up again or even if it doesn't I highly recommend getting the game.

The Director's Cut edition offers an extra set of missions in the middle of the original story.\n\n8/10\n\nPROS\n- Polished gameplay, very few bugs\n- Visuals are nice\n- Content-rich world\n- Fun storyline and side-missions\n- A wide range of useful and interesting character upgrades\n- Reasonably good AI\n- Well-designed environments and levels\n\nCONS\n- A somewhat limited amount of weapons and weapon upgrades\n- Not quite a true open-world experience due to the storyline, which hurts the replayability a bit\n- The director's cut story can be frustrating to play as you temporarily lose your character's weaponry and hard-earned upgrades.\n\n\n\nFull Review	Deus Ex is a FPS with an RPG element where in you unlock and upgrade an array of built-in cyborg capabilities. You can even upgrade your weapons with modifications like laser sights, ammo capacity increases and explosive rounds just to name a few. This aspect stays somewhat true to the original.\n\nGameplay is smooth, but may feel a little clumsy at times when aiming with guns. Sometimes in the heat of a shootout it can feel a bit sluggish trying to gun down enemies whilst strafing around. So keep in mind this is not a shooter like Halo or CoD where you can move around very quickly dodging fire. You need to pick your positions carefully to ensure a clear shot and safe cover.\n\nThe way Deus Ex is meant to be played is taking cover behind objects in your environment, and either gunning down your enemies - or stealth. The stealth mechanics of the game are brilliant. Enemies are very aware of noise and are smart enough to check areas thoroughly if they suspect an intruder is there. If you accidentally alert enemies to your presence, you often have to back out of the whole area unnoticed if you want to remain hidden.\n\nNot only is stealth fun, but the game is highly rewarding of stealth tactics. Enemies are typically easier to kill if you can sneak up on them, you can slip through areas quickly if you plan your movement correctly, and you get bonus experience points for stealth kills and mission objectives. This allows for faster character levelling.\n\nIf you prefer to empty your guns in each room, that's also very fun, but the enemies don't make it easy. Very rarely can you pull a rambo in this game and get away with it. Enemies shoot accurately and will quickly make easy work of you if you are not adequately positioned or equipped with sufficient firepower.\n\nThe visuals are great and most elements in the game are nicely detailed. The environments are awesomely put together. The atmospheric places of America, China and the fictional Panchea create an immersive experience which feels exciting, disturbing, suspenseful and curious all at the same time. In addition to the graphical detail, the areas have many avenues for exploring which can reward you with hidden items, such as powerful weapons and bonus upgrades. Many areas are only accessible after acquiring certain upgrades to your character (e.g. jumping higher and withstandning electrical damage) which adds another entertaining level of complexity to the game.\n\nIt is led by an in-depth storyline with many twists and turns. The main storyline involves hunting down several super-powered soldiers, using similar technology to yourself, in an attempt to find the protagonist's girlfriend (ex... sorta... you'll see) as well as following the suspicious orders of his boss. There are plenty of side-missions which are a good source for extra content and bonus experience and cash.\n\nOverall, Deus Ex: HR - DC is worth the current price of $20 as it does provide some good replayability. You can play through the game using different styles and upgrades and it provides a different experience with each way. If it goes on sale, it is definitely worth picking up to play through at least once.\n\n8/10","December 3, 2015","true","28.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

That having been said, I feel as though there was heart, polish and lots of effort put into this project, so I can overlook that and still say it's good and worth a play. Deus Ex levels of great? No. Still good and worth experiencing? Absolutely.\n\nAs for the Missing Link, it is standard fare as far as DLC go. Very short, it challenges you by limiting your resources and has (mostly) good rewards. Oh, and ends on a very ambiguous and vague note.\n\nShame the endings are all still terrible.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XxSoldier993xX/recommended/238010/","XxSoldier993xX","Lady Black Heart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XxSoldier993xX/","92 products in account","Deus Ex Human Revolution is a very fun FPS/RPG game with, just like the first game in the series, many varieties to approach the situations, either stealthy or run & gun with many weapons & gadgets.\n\nThe gameplay is where it shines but also plummets what it comes to complexity.\n\nDumbed down gameplay mechanics\n1. Augmentations\n\nTo unlock & upgrade your augmentations, you need Praxis points.\nUnlocking costs 2 Praxis points & upgrading 1 for each upgrade.\nThat already is a red flag.\n\nYou can get some good augmentations quite early, especially if you are stealthy & go for pacifist run since you gain more XP.\n\nThere are four ways to get Praxis points:\n- By acquiring required XP points\n- Buying them in LIMB clinic (5000 credits each (you get quite a lot of credits really fast))\n- Completing some side-quests\n- Exploring the world\n\nExample: Cloaking requires four Praxis points to be unlocked & fully upgraded & if you have a lot of candy bars aka CyberBoost ProEnergy Bars, you are already op pretty much plus if you are conservative, you use cloak only between covers.\n\nIn original Deus Ex, skills & augs were two separate things & with augs, you couldn't get powerful ones early. You had to explore for them, find MedBots to install them, plus find the aug upgrade canisters by, again, exploring.\n\nAs for skills, every time you upgraded one of the skills, the next upgrade cost even more points.\n\nSo there is that. It clearly shows simplified rpg elements with that comparison.\n\n2. Takedowns\n\nMelee weapons don't exist. What you do is you kill or knock out a person\nwith a single button press (or holding it to kill). While in quite cool animation, the time stops, so you are safe during that time.\n\nIn the original Deus Ex, you had a baton & other lethal melee weapons.\nYou actually had to aim at the back of the enemy & knock him out or kill him, while being vulnerable & prone to being detected.\n\n3. Doors being locked only by a keypad\n\nWish there could be a better variety of doors or safes being locked with.\nLike locks or something.\n\n4. Too many air vents\n\nIt took me out of the immersion to see so many air vents in the game.\nSure, you don't have to use them but it doesn't change the game being dumbed down like crazy.\n\nYou'll be like "Oh, there is a vent? Now, I can safely sneak past the guards."\n\nThese dumbed down gameplay mechanics can be a matter of an opinion.\nSo, it's either plus or minus for some people.\n\nBoss battles\nEverybody have already said their thoughts on bosses in this game.\nFor me, first boss was indeed terrible work but the other two weren't that bad, though they were easy.\n\nThing is, you are forced to kill them while doing the pacifist approach.\nIt's not about carrying a gun with you against them, since the arenas have more than enough weapons & ammunition to kill them.\n\nBut the fact that, it's Deus Ex. You ought to have choices to either fight them\nor let them live to help you or not.\n\nWhat does Director's cut change? Well, the arena you fight them, is expanded & presents you more opportunities to defeat them, so it ain't only with weapons.\n\nNot great but it is something. I heard Mankind Divided will change this by giving you a choice to fight them, or talked to them & convince them not to fight you & what not.\nHopefully, this is true.\n\nI'd like to point out an extra issue, though. They have no background stories whatsoever, so they aren't something you should care about.\n\nVending machine endings\nThis is a spoiler-free issue I'd like to point out.\n\nLike the original Deus Ex & unlike Invisible War, your consequences during the game don't affect the endings at all.\nIt's literally a select-the-ending button & nothing else.\n\nI heard it's because of the budget & time restraint, so hopefully they will bring a change to Mankind Divided.\n\nPeople may crap on Invisible War but at least that game had something improved over its predecessor & successor.\n\nOther flaws\n- There are two kinds of people. Those who prefer stealth & others, who prefer run & gun.\nThe issue is that run & gun rewards you less than stealthy approach.\nThis can be quite a turn off for action players as they would see that there is no point of playing\nit that way if they don't get rewarded as equally as the other play-style.\n\n- In the load screen, if there is text, then give me a choice to continue after the game is loaded.\nNot put text there for people to read & let game load fast & continue automatically.\nWhat's the point of placing text in the load screen & not being able to read it?\nThis goes to every game that does this.\n\nThings I liked better than in the original game\n- Hacking is a mini-game now\n- Better AI\n- Jensen can talk during your control of him, like during transmissions\n\nConclusion\nStill a fun & back then refreshing from these "Call of Dooty: I can't believe u r buyingz saem gaem annually" with quite few flaws & dumbed down gameplay mechanics.\nHopefully Mankind Divided will bring these issues to the table & think of solutions.\n\nGood game & quite enjoyable story too.\nOh & The Missing Link implemented into Director's cut, has one of the most disturbing content & quite intriguing stories & I LOVED IT!","November 21, 2015","true","95.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The characters are memorable, layered, the conversations feel very natural, the writing is awesome.\nThere are many moral choices and all lead to different conclusions. There are different endings and overall the lore of the game is somewhat ironically feels like it's pointing the finger to our real world. You will see some of teh best looking endings in gaming history.\nThe gameplay is polished, the rpg elements are simple to understand and well implemented.\nYous simply have everything here...

Yep you can be like Hulk, Rambo, Leon the professional, or Sam Fisher to tackle your missions, using your enviroment in many different ways.\nI strongly recomend this game to any gamer regardless of what type of game you like to play, it feels like there si something and everything for anyone here.","February 8, 2015","true","34.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Augmentations are not the advanced nanotechnological augmentation used by the two protagonists of the previous games, JC or Alex Denton, they are mechanical augmentation, the type of augmentation used by Gunther Hermann or Anna Navarre for example in Deus Ex. The philosophical subject of the game is like the epic cyberpunk movie "Blade Runner" how is meant to be human if you are completed by cybernetics and how dangerous is this power given by technology against the human freedom, as proven by history that can become abuse. Constantly harping on a moral-dilemma theme of humanity's troubling interface with technology\n\nMary DeMarle(narrative director) wrote a well-written story, with reallistic and humanized dialogs. Due to the RPG element of the game the answering options of every conversations are really good and can also alterate and effect the storyline of the game. There also many moments that you are called to take ethical decisions making you uncomfortable, of course if you are sceptical-philosophical human being. The ending (no spoiler dont worry) is one of the best and well-written endings i ever seen-read and that is one negative in this, i just seen-read not played like the first Deus Ex. But for me it was so literature and well-written that satisfied my erge for playable ending like the first one. Generally is not good as the first Game of the franchise but is more phillosophical and close to our future dystopian world that comes faster and faster.\n\nThe graphics are decent and the art-atmosphere of the game is JUST STUNNING. JONATHAN JACQUES-BELLETETE (Art Director) made an incredible world, merging the cyberpunk element of movies such as Blade Runner and Ghost in the shell and Renaissance. Is one of the best artistic styles i ever seen, the outcome of these two elements with a tone of sepia in the colors of the world is absolutelly mesmerizing, making a cyber-noir vision of our world. It also remarkable the architecture of EVERYTHING in this game. Every street in the cities, buildings, rooms, even furnitures, lamps, computers... are pieces of art.\n\nThe gameplay of Deus ex: Human Revolution is like a classic FPS game added with the stealth element. It's much improved from the first game in many things but doesnt gives you the option to focus in one gameplay style. You can play as an FPS monkey type gamer shooting here and there everything in the game or  play stealthy along the missions giving you the oportunity to explore and discover a variaty of pathways that are hidden on the map of every place you are. Also you can combine these two gameplay styles. It has a kind of open world with a lot of stunning sceneries and hidden places for you to discover. The skilling system is interesting and gives you a lot of fun stuffs, options to unlock and upgrade, some of them can also enrich the dialog options and alterate the storyline. The hacking element also is present in this game like the first and ofcourse is different.  The inventory is pretty hardcore, cause every item you add in to it gets a certain amount of space and every same item cannot merge with the other. For an example if you have two magazines of any weapon, doesnt  take one space-slot.\nFinally i wanna notice about the BEST soundtrack i ever listen in a game. Michael McCann was thought to follow the main art idea, marying the future and the past and to add an acoustic side in a electronic based music, which took the form of vocals / acoustic instruments. He made a really good job on that and this thing is noticable because he actually was impresed by the very strong philosophical / religious / political themes that permeate the story.\n\nSummary\n+Great story\n+Stunning Art-Atmosphere\n+Mesmerising Soundtrack\n+Stealth element\n+Augmentation/hacking elements\n\n-Some silly voice acting (Lead character sounds like Batman)\n-Linear boss fights\n-Long load times","January 24, 2015","true","36.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A huge amount of passion went into the making of it and it really shows.\n\nI've played through this version twice on PC, plus three times when the original was released on consoles, and I have to say that after 5+ playthroughs of the game the director's cut dramatically improves the experience and for me it is now the only way to play it.\n\nThe story is truly fantastic and caters for the player's style and choices made throughout the game.  The game's graphics and gameplay is also wonderful, albeit have a slightly dated feel to them due to the age of the game's engine (created 2007-2011), but in fairness these limitations are explained by the developers in the included commentary; either way, this does not ruin the game whatsoever and I thoroughly recommend it.","January 26, 2015","true","74.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I went into the control room nect door hacked into the security hub and turned them on to attack enemies. So i went outside picked one up and held it in front of me like a minigun and COMPLETELY overkilled the first boss!!!\n\nThe stealth system is also really good featuring noise as a factor and using cover to try and hide yourself can make it very interesting.

Its plot is deep and intriguing, it will put you in front of many moral choices and you will have to face the consequences of those choices. You can tailor your characters to your preference -- either stealthy, tough and heavily armed or a mix of both. You can even finish the game without hurting a single person, if you exclude the bosses.

Actually the game provides many ways of approaching it's challenges, in my opinion if you want the full experience go for stealth, most of the perks acquired by the lv. up system will give you a boost regarding the stealth approach. Also this is one of those games that playing in the highest difficulty is actually fun rather than frustrating (again, with a stealth approach), it is all about patience and studying your enemies patterns. Now the story while based on science fiction is not that far off on what may occur in the future, it raises many philosophical dilemmas and shows the varios sides and opinions through different characters.

It is one of the best stealth games that I have come across in the last few years. Yet, it's not just a stealth game. It provides several playstyles in which you can utilize during the game. The replayability factor simply rises because of it, as you naturally are tempted into playthroughs targetted to specific goals and playstyles.\n\nThe graphics are solid, yet don't tax mid-range systems. Even some low end systems should be able to run with this title and still look decent. It's very easy on the eyes and the gpu at the same time. The story line is a cut above for it's genre, in my opinion. It has depth, color, imagination, and well-thought out twists and turns. When it's time to decide your stance in the world, you really feel like you're a part of this world. My advice is to not rush this game; don't view it as stages to be completed. Go everywhere, do everything... explore and take your time at each stage of the game... get lost in the character you're playing instead of the goal you're trying to achieve.\n\nThis game doesn't fall short many places, but that's not saying it's perfect. There's room for expansion and improvement. I, for one, am really looking forward to any news of a sequel worthy of to succeed this game and see where they go with this amazing creation. I say one that is worthy of this game, because this game is quite literally the best entry into this franchise and the other titles that bear it's Dues Ex mark can't even stand in the same arena as this entry in my opinion.\n\nAll in all, I give this game a 9/10 overall and highly recommend this game to anyone!","October 30, 2014","true","130.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a deep, rich storyline and setting that fans of cyberpunk--from Blade Runner to Ghost in the Shell--will greatly appreciate. The gameplay is smooth and challenging, and players of games such as Metal Gear Solid, Mass Effect, Thief, and the original Deus Ex will find themselves right at home with this fantastic title.\n\nWith the Director's Cut, a few changes and additions have been made. The most notable of these are the inclusion of the DLC missions into the main campaign--the Missing Link is no longer a separate game--the improved boss fights, and the developer commentary. There were other minor changes, but many players may not notice these. The inclusion of the Missing Link chapter helps round out the storyline, as well as give the player the opportunity to redo his or her skill points, which was something missing from the original 2011 release.\n\nThe improved boss fights were appreciated, though the additional avenues of defeating the bosses will still take some quick thinking, or trial and error, to truly take advantage. For fans that want a more balanced approach to the game, where any style of play is rewarded, this is the edition to purchase.\n\nDeveloper commentary in this version of the game is an interesting and valuable addition. It can be toggled on or off at the player's convenience, and many of the nodes offer intriguing insight into the minds of the game's creators. The only minor irritations with the commentary involve the nodes themselves. They are not always apparent in the game world, and once a node is playing it cannot be stopped without going into the main menu options and toggling the commentary off. Still, in spite of that minor oversight, the commentary is exciting to listen to and veteran players will appreciate it.\n\nI highly recommend that new and old fans of Deus Ex: Human Revolution grab a copy of the Director's Cut.","June 28, 2014","true","46.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is fairly linear by nature, but it does offer different playstyles (shoot people vs don't shoot people), and there doesn't seem to be much in the regards of "gray area" in moral development. Either you're an unrelenting murderous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and you're treated as such, or you're a saint (or ♥♥♥♥♥, according to others). Moreover, the game's regarding of your moral standing is fluid in the sense that people don't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about your past, only about what you just did 5-10 minutes ago. And, there's a lot of decisions that you make that you'd think would come back to bite you in the ♥♥♥, but there's really only a select few that will serve to impede you in any way if you make the 'wrong' choice.\n\nThe game is somewhat difficult if you're playing it for a stealth-based game, and pathetically easy if you're not.

Without spoilers, the storyline was engrossing, weaving all the characters together into a network of conspiracy and intrigue. The time I needed to play through the game first-time was about 50 hours, so you're getting your $$'s worth in gaming content. The characters you encounter are memorable and unique in their own ways. (The Chinese still have bad voice-acting, but thats no negative). Social persuasion was a part of the interaction with key characters as well as in the storyline. I'll admit, some of the conversations to convince somebody got pretty intense; hearing what they have to say in response to your own.\n\nThe Combat is an interesting place to address. The mechanics are largely successful in allowing varied gameplay across the missions. If you want to stealth, there are ways to stealth. If you want to be Rambo, you can be Rambo (just expect a bit tougher experience). While going Rambo can get you through a mission, the game rewards the player for being "ghostly", or not detected by the enemy. The maps and locations gave many different approaches to get to an objective or in a firefight. Vents are sometimes seen in walls to allow the hiding of bodies or escaping from fight heat.\n\nThe vast array of augmentations allows the player to shape Adam Jensen into the character you feel comfortable playing as. One of the things I liked about the augmentation system is that it didn't force any down your throat. When you collect Praxis Kits for augmentation upgrades, you have the choice to apply them or not. An interesting game playthrough worth considering is a No-Aug run, where you never upgrade (out of the thoughts of Jensen's aug-opinions).\n\nOverall, after completing the game myself, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys story-driven gameplay and well-executed stealth mechanics. Combining engrossing storyline with gameplay mechanics and player-choice, I rate this game a 9.5/10.","July 24, 2014","true","86.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

This gives it a lot of replay value ( at least for me). The stealth system is pretty well done, i've seen better stealth games but it's still a great stealth game, the more violent way of playing isn't the great part of this game as its not really enjoyable at least if you play it on the hardest difficulty. The story is superb and I love how this is a openworld game but still linear. Oberall the normal version of this game is for me one of the best game of the last 3 years and i would highly suggest it.\n\nNow the question is, is this marveallous game worth it if you already own the normal version, firs of all if you havent played this game yet I highly recommend you buy this version and not the normal version because it also includes the dlc. This upgraded version comes with 3 mayor upgrades: first it includes the dlc, second it has the developers commentary which I find highly entertaining and it just gives you more depth in the game and thirt boss fights can be done stealthly. It also upgrades a bit the graphics and some game mechanics. I recommend this version if you dont own th dlc, but if you dont own it  recommend it because of the dlc and developers commentary because it gives your new playthrough more depth at the cost of just 5 euros.\n\nI find this version superior to the normal version and a must have on your gaming library","August 5, 2014","true","37.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even though it was promised they would be rebalanced for stealth, each of the bosses were kept to shooting them to death. It is possible to do non-lethal kills but it still goes down to shotting a bullet sponge. Although this does not detract from an over all enjoyable experience.","November 29, 2013","true","30.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In my eyes, the weakest part was the "Missing Link" quest line, that was a DLC/Add-on in the original game and "built-in" here in the Director's Cut (repetitive and with hardly any consquence on the main story). It just felt out of place while playing it.\nPlayed it the stealth way on "Give me Deus Ex" (hardest difficulty) and was very pleased with it.\nThe cover system works, augmentations are interesting and using them is fun.\nAlso, there is plenty of optional lore detail hidden on datapads and computers. The issue of human augmentation, with progress, purity and morality in between, managed to captivate me like no other in any other video game lately.\nGraphics and audio are satisfying (really liked the soundtrack), most animations are fluent and good looking. On the other hand: cut scenes vary vastly in terms of quality (some seem old and some might have been freshly added with the Director's Cut) and a lot of face textures and animations look like PlayStation2 imports.\n\nWell presented, immersive and fascinating vision of the future with some story lengths and gameplay flaws you can easily overlook if you let yourself in for it. 8/10","June 9, 2014","true","25.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's mostly for the newcomers, not for you.  The integration with all the DLC is a bit better too.  You don't get all the DLC weapons straight away like before but they're still present in-game.\n\nFor those newcomers:\nIt is a GREAT way for those looking to get into Stealth games.  It is easy to pick up and challenging to master while still not making things EXCLUSIVELY stealth-oriented.  The dialogue battles are also pretty great and tense, and I was amazed to see how they weren't just "do these options in this order".  It does really well at giving you a variety of choices, whether they be diplomatic or aggressive.

It has a deep, rich storyline and setting that fans of cyberpunk--from Blade Runner to Ghost in the Shell--will greatly appreciate. The gameplay is smooth and challenging, and players of games such as Metal Gear Solid, Mass Effect, Thief, and the original Deus Ex will find themselves right at home with this fantastic title.\n\nWith the Director's Cut, a few changes and additions have been made. The most notable of these are the inclusion of the DLC missions into the main campaign--the Missing Link is no longer a separate game--the improved boss fights, and the developer commentary. There were other minor changes, but many players may not notice these. The inclusion of the Missing Link chapter helps round out the storyline, as well as give the player the opportunity to redo his or her skill points, which was something missing from the original 2011 release.\n\nThe improved boss fights were appreciated, though the additional avenues of defeating the bosses will still take some quick thinking, or trial and error, to truly take advantage. For fans that want a more balanced approach to the game, where any style of play is rewarded, this is the edition to purchase.\n\nDeveloper commentary in this version of the game is an interesting and valuable addition. It can be toggled on or off at the player's convenience, and many of the nodes offer intriguing insight into the minds of the game's creators. The only minor irritations with the commentary involve the nodes themselves. They are not always apparent in the game world, and once a node is playing it cannot be stopped without going into the main menu options and toggling the commentary off. Still, in spite of that minor oversight, the commentary is exciting to listen to and veteran players will appreciate it.\n\nI highly recommend that new and old fans of Deus Ex: Human Revolution grab a copy of the Director's Cut.","June 28, 2014","true","46.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You learn of a special-hidden-secret society, that seems ridiculas at first, but it is well integrated into the game, and seems more plausible further along.  The game is built on how you play it, if you decide to go "gun hoe" and moe down all your enemies the ending will be impacted, versus a silent take-your-time approach that pays off in the end.  There are multiple endings with following cinematics, not only 2, or 3 endings, but 4 complete endings.

Deux Ex is a decent game, blending concepts of stealth, shooting, and social engineering.  Unfortunately, it doesn't really excel in any area.  The stealth sequences are very old-fashioned, in that they work well enough if you choose to stay concealed but fall apart badly if you prefer to kill quietly.  The shooting mechanics are hindered by poor controls - left trigger dives for cover instead of aiming down sights, etc - and by guns that just don't feel good.  It's great that the weapons can be upgraded in all manner of ways, but it's all for naught if they don't feel good to shoot.  Case in point: the round from a sniper rifle shouldn't drop in flight by 18 inches during a 25 yard shot.  Also, a guy that gets hit in the head with a finger-long projectile traveling at roughly 700 mph shouldn't immediately snap to attention and try to figure out who shot him just because he's wearing a helmet.  Finally, the parts of the game that attempt to challenge players by way of dialogue choices feels like LA Noire - the clues and responses that you're given don't correspond very tightly to the desired outcomes; two players making the same choices won't necessarily get the same result - it's stupid.\n\nAll that said, the game features an intriguing story and is good enough (barely) at what it does to be worth playing.  The director's cut (poorly) incorporates the Missing Link DLC into the main campaign and adds some optional DVD-style commentary.  Unfortunately, because the upgrade exists as a separate title in the Steam library no saved games or achievements carry over into the new game.  I'd say that it's worth grabbing, but only if you don't already own The Missing Link.","March 14, 2014","true","17.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's got all the DLC (Including Missing Link) preinstalled and neatly weaseled into the main story so it's really just one fluid playthrough of the entire game. I've played some 45 hours which got me two full playthroughs (one for fun and one for achievement-whoring) and an additional four playthroughs of the Missing Link-part because I'm an idiot and forgot that automatic unlocking devices count as grenades, when I was trying to get "Factory Zero".\n\nAnyways, I've read a lot of crap on the forums about people having absolutely TERRIBAD framerates with this version of the game, so if you do not want the commentary and don't really care about playing it all in a fluid playthrough, then you can get the original + DLC instead.\n\nPersonally I find this version way superiour because of what is mentioned above, and for the fact that you now have options for fighting the bosses. You don't HAVE to invest in combat skills in order to beat them. Much appreciated!","August 10, 2014","true","44.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This gives it a lot of replay value ( at least for me). The stealth system is pretty well done, i've seen better stealth games but it's still a great stealth game, the more violent way of playing isn't the great part of this game as its not really enjoyable at least if you play it on the hardest difficulty. The story is superb and I love how this is a openworld game but still linear. Oberall the normal version of this game is for me one of the best game of the last 3 years and i would highly suggest it.\n\nNow the question is, is this marveallous game worth it if you already own the normal version, firs of all if you havent played this game yet I highly recommend you buy this version and not the normal version because it also includes the dlc. This upgraded version comes with 3 mayor upgrades: first it includes the dlc, second it has the developers commentary which I find highly entertaining and it just gives you more depth in the game and thirt boss fights can be done stealthly. It also upgrades a bit the graphics and some game mechanics. I recommend this version if you dont own th dlc, but if you dont own it  recommend it because of the dlc and developers commentary because it gives your new playthrough more depth at the cost of just 5 euros.\n\nI find this version superior to the normal version and a must have on your gaming library","August 5, 2014","true","37.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Original, however, doesn't seem to be available on Steam anymore, so if you've never played it, this is your best (and only) chance!\n\nNow, let's get on with the review.\n\nNever played Human Revolution? - Get it!\nAlready played HR, should I get Director's Cut? - Got money to spare? Want trading cards/badges? Missed DLC? Sure, go for it. Otherwise, not really.\n\nPros\n- amazing story\n- dialogue and other choices have effects later on\n- you can choose stealth and not kill a single enemy or go on an all-out killing spree. You can also combine those two approaches\n- multiple solutions to various situations\n- custom select your abilities (augmentations) to fit your playstyle\n- a lot of playtime for purely single-player experience (first playthrough is likely going to take you 20-30 hours, how many single-player games offer that nowadays?)\n\n\nCons\n- a lot of moving between objectives and your sprinting doesn't last all that long\n(Wow, that's all I could come up with. I may add some more later but right now, I can't seem to think of anything else that could bother someone. Note: See the Differences section below for potential cons)\n\n\nDifferences between regular and Director's Cut [+/-]\n+ re-worked bossfights, making them less harsh on players who choose stealth\n+ integrated DLC\n- colors seem washed out, can be fixed with ENB\n- may encounter some performance issues and/or bugs.

The idea of freedom of choice in this game is a joke "Oh, you can kill him but we will give you a 1/5th of the experience that you would get if you let him live", "very nice headshot! Here is 1/10th of the experience that you would get if you just stunned him".\n\nYeah... the game is made so that you get way lot more XP if you play the pacifist route, and you finish the game way lot faster if you go all Rambo... well in the game's "defense", the Rambe way of doing things requires way less upgrades to work, so you could call that "a balance".\n\noh, and the ending is a joke, you get three buttons, that's it, the ending is the same video just with a diferent voiceover, that's it, this is not a game you should play for the ending but just for the ride.

The game expect you to stick with a the same weapon, if you wish to keep the new weapon, then you need to drop and forgo one of the upgraded weapon, as there are no garage or place to keep your, at least in Borderlans game, there is a garage to keep old weapon that u do not want to dispose yet.\n\n3. Limited Mods for weapon upgrades, if u missed out to collect or buy from certain location, then you have no chance to buy back the previous mods again. Eg. there are total of 6 Damage mods available in game, and there are numerous weapon allowed to upgrade damage stats, if you missed out the 2 mods , then you only left 4 chances to upgrade later on.\n\n4. It was a pain to forgo a almost fully upgradeed weapon to swtich for a new unlocked weapon, because there is limited capacity in your inventory and no garage available to keep weapons.\n\n5.

You learn of a special-hidden-secret society, that seems ridiculas at first, but it is well integrated into the game, and seems more plausible further along.  The game is built on how you play it, if you decide to go "gun hoe" and moe down all your enemies the ending will be impacted, versus a silent take-your-time approach that pays off in the end.

Among the new features are the improvements in Boss Fight where you are not limited or forced to front armed combat, and the integration of The Missing Link DLC.\nPutting the Director's Cut tag to a side, and having played on Normal, I must admit I was faced with one of the dumbest AI. The story, clichéd as it is, it's also interesting enough to get you hooked the whole game. Controls are awkward as shooting mechanics, but once you get used to them it becomes a much enjoyable experience.\nGraphics are very nice, and characters are coupled with good quality voice acting, but it's in the music department where this title really shines. Character levelling and the choices you make give replayability to the different stages and situations.\nIn short, nothing too outstanding, but in spite of it's flaws I still recommend this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HollowCam/recommended/238010/","HollowCam","HollowCam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HollowCam/","235 products in account","The highly anticipated follow up to "the best pc game ever made" and "the worst sequel ever made" is Deus Ex 3 or Deus Ex: Human Revolution. The story focuses on Adam Jensen, a man forced to deal with augmentations on account of his past and present endeavours. In the first Deus Ex the story focuses on JC Denton, a man forced to deal with augmentations based on the time and place he was born. This dynamic offers a more interesting style of storytelling and presents a series of different connections that can be made within the Deus Ex Universe. Human Revolution revolves around the famous quote turned meme " I never asked for this" which although many claim "sums up" Adam's character, it may or may not in some cases. Something that this game did very well was offer players the choice to flesh out Adam's character in their own way. Often with games that focus on non-linear storytelling their biggest downfall falls into the fact that dialogue options are usually very black and white. While I am a big fan of the Mass Effect series, we notice that those games take advantage of the paragon and renegade system. Although that system is not bad, it doesn't leave a lot of room open for player involvement. This game allows the player to grow, learn, and adapt to the obstacles pressed upon you by society partly based on the immersive and breathtaking environments. Simultaneously, you can become your own person: conform, oppress, comfort; a lot of different ways to approach people.\n\nDeus Ex 1, Invisible War, and Human Revolution are all 20 years apart so clearly there needs to be some change in direction. DX1 is a government controlled future influenced by private corporations, ideas and philosophies. Human Revolution perfectly sets up the world leading to Deus Ex 1 and leaves lots of room for Mankind Divided to step in. The game plays like a Deus Ex game. It tackles that perfect style of non-linear gameplay where you don't have to go on one path. Instead, you can crawl in through a vent, go through the front door, take a side door, avoid the area completely, crawl above, and much more. This style of non-linear gameplay was started with Deus Ex 1;  here it is definitely present and based on the improvements to the augmentation and inventory system, we have ourselves the definitive Deus Ex experience.\n\nOverall, I reccomend this game based on it's nearly flawless level design with only a few issues shown during later levels where the gameplay is forced to slow down. It's less of an issue with level design and more with AI placement, however it is extremely rare. The gameplay is perfected here and does not get repetitive based on the non-linear approach you may take. Many complain about the boss fights throwing you out of the immersion of the titles stronger aspects, however, the fights themselves (in the director's cut) are well rounded and not overly simple. I recognize flaws with the bosses, however I feel that people are forgetting that boss fights existed in some manner on Deus Ex 1 along with Invisible War, if you compare that to this title's ability as a sequel, you see a better result here. The game is difficult and fair unlike many modern shooters. Human Revolution immerses you in the story and allows you to build your own character, while it is not confirmed if your save will carry over to Mankind Divided, Human Revolution set up it's sequel with a line of perfection that I look forward to more than any other title in 2016.\n\nPlay this game, play Deus Ex 1; you won't regret it.","July 20, 2015","true","24.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is really standing out in every aspect and everything is executed in the right way.\nThe story is great, varied, with many twists. The characters are memorable, layered, the conversations feel very natural, the writing is awesome.\nThere are many moral choices and all lead to different conclusions. There are different endings and overall the lore of the game is somewhat ironically feels like it's pointing the finger to our real world. You will see some of teh best looking endings in gaming history.\nThe gameplay is polished, the rpg elements are simple to understand and well implemented.\nYous simply have everything here... Queasts, sidequests, different collectibles, reading materials. You can solve missions in many ways, somewhat reminding you of games like the Hitman series just in a Cyberpunk enviroment. Yep you can be like Hulk, Rambo, Leon the professional, or Sam Fisher to tackle your missions, using your enviroment in many different ways.\nI strongly recomend this game to any gamer regardless of what type of game you like to play, it feels like there si something and everything for anyone here.","February 8, 2015","true","34.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have the option to either kill the enemies like a killing machine(literally) or sneak around like a ninja. Difficulty is okay at first and then they slowly raise it as you unlock more and more augmentations, and some parts require you to think hard and make use of the objects in your environment if you want to be a ninja. Boss fights are interspersed at appropriate intervals, so even ninjas have a chance to kill. Stealth in this game can sometimes be an adrenaline rush and hacking wise, I have to say that I find it interesting, especially when you hack higher level terminals. Outside of story missions, you can roam the streets and pick up side quests as well hack into everything you see that has a security terminal, making the game not just limited to main missions, but allowing you to explore and also get achievements. All in all, a 9/10 and I really highly recommend this game if you are willing to dedicate the time to explore the areas of the game.\n\nP.S: Have not finished the game yet but these are my thoughts so far.

This game changed that. Deus Ex Human Revolution is by far one of my favorite games of all time. The pure aspect of the game being a game almost without a genre is appealing to me. The reason I say a game without a genre, is because the game is open, and literally can be played anyway you want. The progression is stellar, both gameplay and storyline wise. The other thing I like about this game is just how open it is. For example, I had to get into a bar to talk to one of the contacts helping me with a mission, there unfortunately was a bouncer outside who wouldn't let me in. I looked for other entrances, and found one but I had to move a dumpster, and my strength wasn't high enough to move it to let me in, hence I pick up another side mission promising me more piraxis points to level up so then I can revisit the club and continue with my story mission. This is the reason why this game is great, there are literally so many different ways and possibilities of completing your mission it warrant multiple play throughs. On top of all of this, the storyline is fantastic, personally I love the voice acting of Adam Jensen (Elias Toufexious) and his grizzled demenour, and the stroyline is just so thick and rich filled with twists and turns and questions, its a very well put together game. Gameplay, Storyline, and Pacing are some of the things that make this great. I can't wait to see what they'll do in the sequel. The only cons I would list, are that the game isn't the prettiest, I understand this was made a couple years ago, but for example Adam Jensen's hair in game just looks atrocious. Only improvement I would request in the sequel.","April 24, 2015","true","76.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At this point, I doubt it'll ever come our way, at least barring a "Super Director's Cut" edition.  Don't be waiting for it.)\n\nThe DE:HR Director's Cut integrates The Missing Link, a previously standalone story, into the original game, and adds in a New Game Plus mode which carries over all abilities (but no items, sadly) from a completed playthrough.  Some preorder-bonus missions are also added in, but the best addition here is a stellar commentary from the biggest names behind the game.  Seriously - give it a listen.  There's a ton of it (about 8 hours total), but quite a bit of it is insightful and interesting.  A new gold standard for commentary in video games (sorry Valve).\n\nNewcomers: this is an absolute steal for twenty bucks.  A playthrough of the Director's Cut will take you anywhere from 35-60 hours, depending on how much you see and do, and it's just a flat-out great game besides.  The art direction, soundtrack, and story are first-rate, as are the scenarios that accommodate a range of playstyles the Deus Ex universe is renowned for supporting.

DXHR is a tactical first person stealth shooter with several RPG elements. Like the original, DXHR encourages player choice with many branching paths all of which lead you to your objective. You could blast your way through guards, hack into and shut down the security, or simply hop in an air duct and avoid everything. However, the choices arent balanced which leads to one of the only issues the game faces. There is no incentive to fighting the bad guys. While there is choice, the game does lead towards the stealth option which has you crawling through ducts and sneaking around the perimeter of the map. However, that doesn't make the game any less satisfying. Avoiding all guards and cameras is every bit as fun as gunning through a room full of guards.\n\nAnother stregnth of the game is the preogression system. The augmentations are all useful and unique. Each one will give you a very useful tool against your enemies and as a result, the progression system is as rewarding as it could be.\n\nDXHR also benefits from a engaging and well written story which is aided by a superb soundtrack and top-notch voice acting. The story has you, Adam Jensen, traveling around the world in search of the people who led an attack on the Sarif Industries lab months earlier. The narrative never lets up and will keep you searching for the truth all the way through. All in all, DXHR is a worthing prequel the the original Deus Ex, and is worth having.","July 4, 2015","true","33.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Anyways onto the gameplay\n\nThe gameplay is a tps-fps stealth hybrid. Its a hybrid in a sense that you can go into every level or map guns blazing or you can sneak in take-out a few guards silently and complete the objectives wihout tripping the alarm. Each playstyle has its +s and -s but it really only suits to the player's choice.\n\nThe story in the game is by far one of the best played because it all makes sense but leaves you guessing like a really good mystery movie mixed with blade runner.

When I first started the game, I felt that the controls and interface was rather clunky. While the controls can be remapped in the menu, you would have to slowly get used to the interface, such as how to hack, how to upgrade your gear when you level up, and cleaning your inventory.\n\nThe story mainly revolves around the ethics of augmentations, that being when technology advances and when people have the ability to modify their own body (even their mind) such that they function better. This extends beyond mere prostheses for the disabled such as protagonist Adam Jensen, but also willing modifications on perfectly fine bodies. While the benefits are apparant, those who oppose come forward with arguments such as the misuse in crimes or the alteration of oneself away from the image of God.\n\nWhat really attracts me is how the game is open to multiple gameplay approaches. As mentioned, I started the game wanting an FPS, so I went in guns-blazing killing everything I see. Halfway through, I started to incorporate stealth after upgrading specific augmentations and in the end, the game offered me an ending that defined my time as Adam Jensen. There are a total of 12 unique endings and in the one I got, Adam says and I quote: Technologies are invented to make our lives easier -- not our choices. The problem comes when we forget that.\n\n9/10","September 21, 2015","true","23.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is moderately challenging, but still a fun playthrough for any casual FPS player.

You learn of a special-hidden-secret society, that seems ridiculas at first, but it is well integrated into the game, and seems more plausible further along.  The game is built on how you play it, if you decide to go "gun hoe" and moe down all your enemies the ending will be impacted, versus a silent take-your-time approach that pays off in the end.  There are multiple endings with following cinematics, not only 2, or 3 endings, but 4 complete endings.

Because it serves its purpose of making you choose how you'd like to play. From stealthing your way through a whole section, taking down badguys behind every corner, or going guns blazing- killing every one in sight; it's one of those games where choice is present. Although there may be choice, it does not affect your character or story (unfortunately). I played through this game twice and had fun playing it over again just to get the achievements.\n\nThe game itself has a wonderful story; one that opens its way into the earlier Deus Ex games. There are plenty of easter eggs from the previous game to be found here since this is chronologically a prequel to the other Deus Ex games. It was definitely thrilling towards the end where different endings appeared. I saved it at the time to make sure I went across each ending and those endings gave the game justice. I couldn't stop the goosebumps from popping out.\n\nAll in all, if there ever was a chance to get Deus Ex:HR - get it. Make sure it's the Director's Cut too because then you'd have the DLC (Missing Link) implemented in as well as for a few more added features. If not, just get the game regardless.","February 2, 2014","true","39.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Along with stealth combat, you can hack computers, terminals, gun turrents, etc., talk people into giving up information that they normally would not, and the game adds RPG elements in the form of perks or skills.

It has good replay value as well as refined controls, RPG and game changing elements similar to Mass Effect and lots of side quests. Lighting and textures have changed slightly over the original version and the integration of The Missing Link DLC is now more streamlined. Only negative side would be a few bugs that aren't addressed for this version that the original has already addressed through patches which is an awkward move by the developers, but based on the recent patch in november 2013 and a few posts on Eidos' forums, the technical team are listening to the fans in hopes of getting this game bug free.

I purchased this game because it was on sale, cost only $4.99. I watch some trailers and reviews reckoned i could give it a shot. And gladly its worth the money.\n\nFor starters, this game is somewhat like Mass effect + Dishonored hybrid, assuming you know both these games. You might not agree, anyways its just my opinion. But be warned, to me this isint quite a shooter game. It's an FPS, it has got a handful of guns and you can shoot things as shown in the trailer but most of the times you'll be doing lots of stealth, hiding behind covers trying to sneak past enemies. Sounds pretty familiar? (Hitman). Well if you dont like the stealth approach, you could go gun blazing, but i dont think this is the way this game is meant to be played, especially during the first half of the story which is after llike 10+ hours of gameplay (for me) mainly because you could be easily outgunned. Of course you could jump right infront of the enemies and shoot them in the face tough later in the game prior to sufficent upgrade of your carecter.\n\nSo..... If you are looking for fast-paced shooter like COD, your wont get it. Its a slow-paced game involved lots of thinking as in how do i get past this, how do i access that, something like that. If you're in it for the story telling and RPG experience then i recommend you to grab it. The voice acting might not be fantastic but it works and it surely gave me a somewhat unique experience that not many games could offer.\n\nI'd love to give it a 9/10 but -1 for the graphics/visuals, so it's 8/10 ! Dont get me wrong, its graphics aren't crappy at all, is just that i adore better ones.","December 27, 2013","true","36.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story , graphics and gameplay are well done and brings back that classic feeling of Deus Ex, however the director's cut seems to be quite another story for the following reasons:\n\n1. They included Missing link which is awesome , new boss level layouts and a few new missions, however I wish they did expand more of the game world, adding another sector to each city with a few more quests giving more insight to the Augment issues.\n\n2. There seems to be a lot of bugs, the original Human Revolution I didn't run into many issues however in Director's cut i had quite a bit of issues with enemies glitching out and a boss freaking the hell out in which they just stood looking at me and dead bodies flying across the map or sinking into the ground. Either way they are more of a good laugh but sad to see them in a updated/newer vision.\n\n\nIf you haven't played Deus Ex HR, then I do recommend this one as everything is tied together. The story is great and everything is still there or improved...with the side order of bugs/glitches. However if you already have the original version I would recommend to pass this until a sale...there isn't that big of a change to buy it again unless you really enjoyed it or never played missing link story.","February 14, 2015","true","28.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has good replay value as well as refined controls, RPG and game changing elements similar to Mass Effect and lots of side quests. Lighting and textures have changed slightly over the original version and the integration of The Missing Link DLC is now more streamlined. Only negative side would be a few bugs that aren't addressed for this version that the original has already addressed through patches which is an awkward move by the developers, but based on the recent patch in november 2013 and a few posts on Eidos' forums, the technical team are listening to the fans in hopes of getting this game bug free.

Great game play and level desgn leaving for the player to choose three ways to tackle each objective. Throughout the game you will be put against challenges where the only limitation is the skills that you have at the time. My major gripe against the game is that the boss fights are unchanged. Even though it was promised they would be rebalanced for stealth, each of the bosses were kept to shooting them to death. It is possible to do non-lethal kills but it still goes down to shotting a bullet sponge.

Either way being fun, leaving players wanting to redo a checkpoint to perfect a certain method to complete it.\nThis kind of gameplay has innevitably resulted in AI being a bit stuipid and too oblivious at times. Additionally, some boss fights are bit over the top and unnesccary.\nHowever, the variety of skills the player has to choose from and the unique environments of each chapter/level overshadows these faults.\nDeus Ex has been an example and of why games should be taken more seriously, and have alot more potential than being viewed as violent shoot em ups' as seen in the past.\n\n\n- 9/10","March 17, 2014","true","52.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I liked the customization of the weapons and the options of how to finish the game. You have a lot of side quests and options for play style as well (for instnace, guns a blazing or stealth killing etc.) Boss battles are in the game, I know some people do not like those. The boss battles might be complicated if you are playing a style that is more stealth based.\n\nThe game has great graphics, sound, controller support and I ran into no bugs. I enjoyed it and have played through it a couple times on the PC and on my Xbox 360. While it had the storyline and elements of the playstyle of Deus Ex.

This game is one of the best stealth games but this game doesn't provide you with the "♥♥♥♥ someone saw me im a dead man" type of stealth . In here stealth is something that you can do but nobody forces you to only go stealth you can go rambo with augments and murder every enemy you see ( wich is very fun) . Variety of weapons you can choose , buy or pick up . Each one is unique , some provide you with very fast rates of fire , incredibly high amount of damage , or the good feeling of "you didn't kill that person he is just uncouncious" or the oposite. Augments are pretty key feature in this game and the augments are well made and they provide you with new ways to play the game wich ads more diversity . The inventory can be upgraded with augments and it is very much like the Resident Evil 4's inventory you will have to manage it to have space for weapons and gadgets . Verdic : This game is fun works well and provides many ways to play it and it doesn encourage you to be diverse so i suggest you check it out .

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XenoDerpimus/recommended/238010/","XenoDerpimus","漫画 Xenos 漫画","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XenoDerpimus/","101 products in account","Deus Ex: Human Revolution has one of the most interesting and involved plotlines I have seen in a game for a long time. It keeps throwing new things at you every twist and turn, but it doesn't feel like it's just pulling things out of its ♥♥♥. For once in a game, I felt legitimately motivated to seek out and perform sidequests, just to see how they would be presented as a story. The journey was fantastic, but the destination was rather lacking. I'm dissapointed that this game, which always pointed out the difference between lethal and non-lethal means of taking enemies down, only had 4 standard endings. All of which literally involved a choice of one of three buttons or saying f*ck it and destroying everything around you. There are no differences for playing incredibly lethally or sneaking around and not killing anyone.\n\nSpeaking of sneaking, it is one of the hardest things to do in this game during later levels. It became less about "avoiding detection until you reach you goal", and instead became "Try and stealthily take out as many enemies as possible before it turns into another gigantic shootout." Enemies are positioned a bit too perfectly, making it impossible to take somebody down witout being seen immediately. Also, unlike other stealth games, instead of just having one person notice you, upon being spotted the entire building suddenly knows exactly which crate you hid behind and proceed to light the place up with gunfire. I do appreciate the fact that enemy bullets do massive damage just like they would in real life, but I despise how the armor upgrades barely change it. I want my damage negations to be effective, especially considering how much I am being shot at. Ignoring the stealth for a minute however, the actual shooting isn't half bad. Hiding behind a wall and shooting down a hallway always has a certain charm to it, and there aren't cliche'd chest-high walls everywhere. At least they did the decency of making it a potted plant, desk, or other random object getting between you and the bullets. However, the difficulty of the game decreases almost to zero if you invest into the default pistol. With a silencer and armor piercing rounds, a single headshot becomes a lethal, untracable death bringer that can clear out entire maps without being noticed. More often than not I found myself in a high area sniping people with the pistol until nothing moved. It also becomes incredibly effective against robots, which are a gigantic threat in the game reduced to just a heavily armored gun.\n\nAnother kinda notable feature is the "Talking Parts". Basically you have to strategically talk to somebody to convince them to give you something. It's a pretty interesting mechanic, but personally all it did was remind me how bad I am at talking to people. I can't give a clear like or dislike to that mechanic.\n\nAll in all, while it has its notable downsides, I felt the upsides, like the story and not having too much or too little ammo, in addition to fun combat made it a worthwhile purchase.","July 15, 2015","true","87.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, once I actually started playing the game, it took less than a half an hour for me to become completely immersed in the story and general gameplay. From a skeptic to a raging fan, I cannot praise this game highly enough. The quests are fun, the content is challanging, and the game gets extra points for the "New Game+" feature, which adds to the replay value.\n\nThe only complaint I can really offer for this game - when I finally beat it, I felt a bit disappointed that it was over. I realize that I had logged 31 hours into the game already, but a part of me felt like I should only be about halfway through the game.  Yep. That's right. My complaint is that I beat it.

My main disappointment is how it motivates you to play in a very narrow way (a certain stealth approach); rendering all of the cool gadgets you collect null. I’ll explain later.\n\nThe game throws you right into the middle of things, and you need to pay attention to understand who’s who and what’s what. There’s no slow prologue telling how the world came to be in the state it is and how you find yourself there. It's something I like, because it helps establish this sense of realism that sticks throughout the entire game - that this is an actual world, not dependent on your existence to continue moving. You are part of it, not the center of it. Still, I’ll help you with the basic orientation.\n\nYou’re Adam Jensen, former SWAT and currently chief of security at a biotech company, that is at the forefront of human augmentation (mechanical upgrades to humans) research and development. You are an existing and set character, not a blank slate, so the choices you make are limited to what is reasonable for Adam to do. Many people enjoy creating their characters out of scratch. This is not that kind of game. Personally, I prefer this format. It’s a fine balance that offers some amount of input, but not too much to the point that it sacrifices the depth of the story just to give you more choices that end up being shallow. Speaking of which, the consequences of your decisions are also pleasantly felt later on. I didn't find them to be too drastic, but the small nods were satisfying nevertheless.\n\nAugmentation is the main topic the world is embroiled in at 2027, and the debate about its pros and cons extends to ethical, political, economical and social aspects. It’s a nice take on sci-fi that manages to keep things still relatively grounded and credible, while also enjoying some creative liberties where the developers wanted to emphasize the subject. Suspension of disbelief is required in some places more than others, but overall the game manages to sell a believable, alternate world. And it’s a bleak one. Earth is in the midst of a cyber renaissance, but once you move away from the socialites to the streets and alleyways, you will feel an atmosphere that is opposite from the optimistic aura of revolution that is present among the upper class. The change the world is going through isn’t embraced by all, doesn’t grace all, and there is an obvious tension in the air. The title of the next game is Mankind Divided, but the hints and seeds of that segregation are already found here.\n\nThe progression through levels is linear. While you revisit some of them, they’re in a changed state, and you can never go back to a level you’ve finished. They’re divided into the regular hub areas you know from most RPGs – open areas for your exploration to restock, talk with people, do side quests, etc – and the hostile levels that are much more fight or stealth oriented. Less talk, more action.\n\nAugmentations are the source of your abilities, and they’re varied enough to make leveling up an exciting occurrence. DE:HR isn't plagued by endless passive upgrades (e.g. 4% damage increase) that leave you with nothing to look forward to. You have plenty of enhancements that are new abilities, which allow you to do things you couldn’t previously achieve. There’s an interesting dialogue system that triggers with certain, important NPCs. One augmentation helps you better analyze these key figures to find the correct answer. Hacking is everywhere, and the mini-game that seems confusing at first turns out to be simple and fun. You can choose to jump higher to reach new areas, punch through weak walls or move heavy objects to open additional routes. And on the RPG note, you even have an old-school inventory system that forces you to choose what to take and what to ditch. Weapons or stealth equipment? You can't have everything.\n\nAll these abilities and gadgets have their uses thanks to great level design. Stealth games can be compared to puzzles, and each room in DE:HR has multiple solutions to it. You can crawl through vents around your enemies, hack into the security system and turn turrets or robots against them, move huge crates that offer you a shortcut or jump up high to snipe them. You also have some cool tactical augmentations that make things easier and allow you to better plan or execute your actions. You can see through walls, turn invisible or run silently without alerting enemies. It’s all very fun, and part of the reason for my inflated play time – other than just enjoying the stroll slowly and taking in all the details of this beautifully crafted world (or, uh, alt-tabbing) – is because I always wanted to explore each region to its fullest after I cleared it of enemies, in order to see all the alternate routes I didn’t utilize.\n\nYou can also just shoot your way through, but here is my main complaint about the game, and it’s a fairly big one. DE:HR, strangely, offers you a huge array of tools, from lethal to non-lethal, loud or silent, but doesn’t encourage their use. You can silently kill people with your crossbow, loudly blast them with a rocket launcher, tranquilize them, stun them, throw grenades, set mines, use robots, or just engage in massive gunfights with several fun options in weaponry. And while the fighting mechanics aren’t top of the end, from what I toyed around with, they’re still fun. On the hardest difficulty you die very quickly if you’re reckless, but your enemies aren’t bullet sponges, either – and that makes for intense battles. The problem with all of this is that DE:HR rewards an extremely specific game style. It’s not even that it’s just stealth – it’s stealth takedowns (melee). Meaning that even all your stealth equipment might go unused.\n\nIf you don’t care about min-maxing, this won’t matter to you. But I have this suspicion that most gamers do want to unlock more powers, and when you get 10 XP for shooting down an enemy from afar, or 50 for taking them down in a non-lethal manner from up close, I imagine you’ll be inclined to do the latter. That 50 piles up in the long run. You also get bonuses at the end of the mission, depending on whether or not you were spotted, and whether an alarm was raised. Together, these bonuses amount to a huge sum that you’ll never enjoy in an aggressive approach, since it doesn’t offer some alternate reward for different achievements. This also caused me to quick-load over and over, since letting things develop dynamically felt more like a punishment. By the end of the game, a non-lethal, melee takedown playstyle will end up rewarding the player significantly more, mechanically, but will also become very repetitive. It’s disappointing that the game offers so many fun instruments, but motivates you with its XP distribution to use one single function alone throughout the entire playthrough. There’s an NG+ option in the director’s cut, and I might do a second run sometime in the future with my developed build, so I can enjoy fighting my enemies guilt-free and without that fear of missing out. But for a single playthrough, it ends up feeling like wasted potential. The gameplay offers you many options but draws a thick, red circle around a very specific one with a big smiley above it.\n\nIt’s a major complaint from my perspective, but regardless, as a whole, the experience remains terrific. For anyone interested in a stealth-oriented game with a mature and interesting story and awesome setting, DE:HR is highly recommended. For those who want a sci-fi action game, you can find it here too, albeit discriminated against. You need to approach it with a mentality that doesn’t fret about receiving the bare minimum XP.","September 20, 2015","true","64.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It oozes all 3 of those things at every opportunity. Every detail is perfected, heavily scrutinizable and relatable to the game world. It is by far one of the most immersive experiences in video gaming. All of these factors contribute to a perfect synthesis of what video games should strive for.\n\nBossfights sucked in the original version but thats why we have directors cut!\n\n\n\n","September 3, 2015","true","49.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although some of the missions can be very difficult even at the medium difficulty, I still find the missions fun, and IMO this game gets the best of both worlds from the shooter genre and the RPG genre. The soundtrack is pretty good, too, and the story is even better.\n\nThat being said, I do feel like this game lacks in the shooter part just a bit. One of the first things I noticed in the gunfights was how unnatural ADS felt. I also think the switching from first person to third person when taking cover could be a lot more smooth. Still, these complaints are very minor.\n\n9.5/10","April 3, 2014","true","22.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is amazing with mystery around every corner as you try to solve why your Sarif Industries is being targeted by an unknown group. On the way the game makes it feel like an RPG in the way that you can upgrade your character, your characters weapons pretty much everything. And during the whole game besides the in game guidance the game makes you feel very independant and makes you constantly question yourself "am I doing the right thing" "should I sneak attack or go in guns blazing on everyone". It also has alot of things to do on the wa,y such as looting bodies or hacking random computer just to get that little credit bonus or ammo that makes the game go for so, so much more longer.This combined with its amazing graphics and gameplay make for quite the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XenoDerpimus/recommended/238010/","XenoDerpimus","漫画 Xenos 漫画","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XenoDerpimus/","101 products in account","Deus Ex: Human Revolution has one of the most interesting and involved plotlines I have seen in a game for a long time. It keeps throwing new things at you every twist and turn, but it doesn't feel like it's just pulling things out of its ♥♥♥. For once in a game, I felt legitimately motivated to seek out and perform sidequests, just to see how they would be presented as a story. The journey was fantastic, but the destination was rather lacking. I'm dissapointed that this game, which always pointed out the difference between lethal and non-lethal means of taking enemies down, only had 4 standard endings. All of which literally involved a choice of one of three buttons or saying f*ck it and destroying everything around you. There are no differences for playing incredibly lethally or sneaking around and not killing anyone.\n\nSpeaking of sneaking, it is one of the hardest things to do in this game during later levels. It became less about "avoiding detection until you reach you goal", and instead became "Try and stealthily take out as many enemies as possible before it turns into another gigantic shootout." Enemies are positioned a bit too perfectly, making it impossible to take somebody down witout being seen immediately. Also, unlike other stealth games, instead of just having one person notice you, upon being spotted the entire building suddenly knows exactly which crate you hid behind and proceed to light the place up with gunfire. I do appreciate the fact that enemy bullets do massive damage just like they would in real life, but I despise how the armor upgrades barely change it. I want my damage negations to be effective, especially considering how much I am being shot at. Ignoring the stealth for a minute however, the actual shooting isn't half bad. Hiding behind a wall and shooting down a hallway always has a certain charm to it, and there aren't cliche'd chest-high walls everywhere. At least they did the decency of making it a potted plant, desk, or other random object getting between you and the bullets. However, the difficulty of the game decreases almost to zero if you invest into the default pistol. With a silencer and armor piercing rounds, a single headshot becomes a lethal, untracable death bringer that can clear out entire maps without being noticed. More often than not I found myself in a high area sniping people with the pistol until nothing moved. It also becomes incredibly effective against robots, which are a gigantic threat in the game reduced to just a heavily armored gun.\n\nAnother kinda notable feature is the "Talking Parts". Basically you have to strategically talk to somebody to convince them to give you something. It's a pretty interesting mechanic, but personally all it did was remind me how bad I am at talking to people. I can't give a clear like or dislike to that mechanic.\n\nAll in all, while it has its notable downsides, I felt the upsides, like the story and not having too much or too little ammo, in addition to fun combat made it a worthwhile purchase.","July 15, 2015","true","87.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The majority of the game is free roam and the choices you make during the game will effect the world around you. Based before the original Deus Ex you are placed in the role of Adam Jensen an ex-swat team member, who now finds him self in charge of security for one of the largest biotechnology firms in America.\n\nStory:\nThe Deus games have always been driven on conspiracy theory’s, Human Revolution is no different. All through the game you will be questioning who to trust and who not to, friends may become enemiesand enemies friends. The story really does a great job of keeping you suspicious, your never sure if your a good guy or a bad one. Add to that some of the choices the game gives you with no clear moral option, you’ll find yourself constantly second guessing yourself.\nBut the story does feel rushed at times and some questions it rises never really feel answered, some moments feel unexplained. In fact if you turn the commentary on in extras they them selves will tell you they ran out of time to fully realize all they wanted to do. Its a shame as it really does show, But what’s there is good and achieves exactly what they were trying to.\n\nGameplay:\nAs of late I’ve been struggling to get in to FPS games as the market is so saturated, but Deus Ex HRDC does truly offer something different from the norm. The controls are a pretty standard fair with one or two odd key placements, but nothing that hampers the experience. But its the augmentations that really put this game apart, some being basic things like faster sprinting or improving hacking skills. But its the stealth augments and things like punching through walls that really make this fun, and stealth is a big element of Deus. Its possible if your careful and cleaver to get through almost every mission without firing a shot, but at times you will probably have to so lucky even your weapons are upgradeable too.\nIf I have one major criticism of the gameplay, its the cover system. When you take cover or use a take down move you move into 3rd person view, this is great for a visual effect but feels really jarring in practice. It just doesn’t flow right and left me feeling like they should have ether made the whole game in 3rd person or found a way to do it in 1st person. Even the option like Skyrim where you can use ether view I would have welcomed over the way its executed here, I also feel that FPS vets will probably not use the cover system anyway.\n\nPresentation:\nThe graphics are great for a 2 year old game and really do give that futuristic atmosphere. Some maps do feel like your walking down the same corridor fifteen times as there all so similar, but this is to be expected. Thankfully most levels are in more open settings with a wider verity of surroundings. There at times is a almost Blade Runner feel to the game, this is really emphasized by the neon lit menus and displays in the game. The character models are great too, with every character seeming unique and fresh.\n\nConclusion:\nI really enjoyed Deus, more than I thought I would. If your looking for something a little deeper than the standard FPS then really look no farther. With a deep plot that to me seem heavily inspired by the works of Isaac Asimov and gameplay that’s a little different I found it a real breath of fresh air. There’s really not a lot here not to like and I would recommend it highly to anyone into FPS games.\n\nSee this and other reviews here http://www.cyberusuk.com/post/114658327513/deus-ex-human-revolution-directors-cut-review","March 31, 2015","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

By the time I remembered about the game, it was a few years after release and the graphics looked somewhat dated and I was foolish enough to give the game a skip based on that.\n\nThen a friend of mine offered me a spare copy of the game going free, so I thought 'Ack, why the heck not!' and installed with haste. I played it straight over the following three days, putting 25.8 hours into the game, completing it on the hardest difficulty (or at least, the hardest available. I think there might be an even harder level now available after completing the game).\n\nOh boy, it was good.\n\nProblem was, I went through the entire game without killing anyone. Or so I thought. Then I remembered I shot someone in the tutorial. Whoops. Oh well, just an achievement.\n\nThe game was rather easy to play, especially if you play non-lethal ghost. I've not tried out going loud - I suspect it'd be much harder, considering the amount of damage they deal on harder difficulties. So one might want to take that into mind.\n\nGameplay wise the game is above average - it's not exactly a great shooter, but the stealth is decent enough. It could be improved and I hope in the new game they make the combat a little more intuitive and/or realistic. But there will always be more one can want.\n\nYet what makes it great is the world and the story, and how people react to your actions. It feels nice when people comment about your lack of lethal use throughout the game - and, without spoiling anything, saving certain characters also happens to have a significant impact on the game too.\n\nObviously in my review, however basic it may be, I'm biased to a degree because I didn't actually purchase the game - but having played it, I would've bought it (at sale price, because I'm stingy) had I know what the game was actually like to player.\n\n\nP.S.

Then (and this is the big one) they fixed the three boss fights.  If you set up Jensen as a brawler and killing isn't an issue, then these fights weren't a big deal.

Like the original Deus Ex, it's very open world before open world games became all the rage. Although the game is still driven by quests, you are given alot of latitude in how you do them. You can be mega sneaky, or run and gun, or whatever.\nI thought that the story was particuarly well done. You are Adam Jenson, an ex-cop who was brought back to life with cybernetics (ever seen this plot before? =) and now works for the people who designed the augmentations that saved him.\nAs with many games of this genre, your past comes back to haunt you and everything is not what it seems, etc.\nThe story is very long, it took me about 38 hours on easy mode (almost certainly take longer on hard mode). however, I personally loved playing it.\nI've always been a big fan of the cyberpunk genre and Deus Ex HR delivers in spades, with tons of augmentations you can get (some of them rather useless imho, but I suppose it all depends on your playstyle.)\nThe plot is long and involved and eventually winds up with you having to decide the future of humanity (something else common in games I have noticed.. =)\nI personally thought the graphics, and especially the cutscenes were great, if you have a powerful enough computer, playing it in full 1080 is beautiful.\nI really can't reccommend this game highly enough, especially now that they have incorperated the DLC. My only niggle was with the inventory, which is kind of limited, but then I suppose that is sort of realistic.\nThere are lots of weapons in the game, some great, some useless without augs, but as I said above, because it's an open world game, you get the benefit of choice.\nThe characters are well written and the voice acting is really good, although you may find that the fact that Jenson has only one kind of voice (deep and husky, sort of menacing, like some action movie stars.. =) gets a bit samey after a while.\nStill the only things I can fault in this game are very small things that are really just a matter of personal taste.\nOverall, if you like cyberpunk and you like FPS and stealth, then grab this game.\n99/100 Would doom the world again.","June 15, 2015","true","50.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BackyBoyMemo/recommended/238010/","BackyBoyMemo","Backy~26+6=1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BackyBoyMemo/","185 products in account","I'm writing this review from the perspective of someone who's never touched the first game.\n\nDeus Ex: Human Revolution, to me, is the pinnacle of modern RPG games. It has super satisfying gunplay and extremely tense stealth moments when playing on the hardest difficulty. The areas are incredibly detailed and you are rewarded greatly for not barging though every room. Around every corner there's some kind of secret, a piece of lore in the form of an eBook, Email, Newspaper, etc., and there's always multiple ways to attack any given situation (With some exception to scripted boss fights, which still can technically be taken down any way you please, I took out the first boss with sniper headshots instead of using the explosives in the room)\n\nThe hub areas are massive and filled with unique stories and side quests to be done. The world is alive with police, gang members, and civilians, all able to share specifically two pieces of dialogue with you.\n\nThe combat in this game is extremely satisfying, as is the stealth, as are the persuasion moments, as are the non-lethal takedowns, as are the lethal takedowns. This game lets you approach in any way you choose and you can have a good time doing it.\n\nThat's being said, this game obviously is not without it's faults, and here's a quick pro/con list to help sort some of these things out.\n\n\nPROS:\n\nStealth and Combat are equally satisfying:  Though one option is technically better, and I'll get to that in a moment, neither is more satisfying than the other. The stealth mechanics work really well, where if one enemy thinks he sees you the others aren't immediatly alerted. They'll question whether the guy who saw you is going crazy or drunk or something before searching for you, if they even do. Enemies don't just instantly drop what they're doing, they go through a few stages of detection. Oblivious, Suspicious, Alterted, and Hostile. At each stage it will take longer for them to ignore you, and they will be more and more alert. The gunplay is also extremely well put together, with the guns feeling satisfying and being extremely fun to use effectively. So in the event you're caught, you won't feel dissatisfied (Other than with your lack of ability to stay hidden)\n\n\nThe areas are extremely detailed: There's something unique around every corner, and if you pay close enough attention you can find terminals to hack that lead to weapon mods, money, and ammo. This game rewards you for not rushing it, it rewards you for thinking, and it rewards exploration in a really nice way.\n\nThese are really the two main pros, obviously there's the interesting story backed with gamey voice acting that we're all used to. Some of the voice acting is pretty good, but most of it is pretty corny and obviously read from a script, but that's okay. Now onto the con.\n\nCon:\n\nStealth is clearly the superior way to play. Non-lethal takedowns and hacking reward extremely highly. Normal kills get you 10 whatever points, headshots get you 20, while non-lethal takedowns always get you 30 or more. Hacking also gives you points, so even if you know the code to a door or computer, you might as well just hack it for the extra points and upgrades. Using stealth you can easily unlock every augment in the game, which breaks a lot of replay value. The only reason not to use stealth would be to see how the story changes when you kill everyone, which is extremely difficult on the hardest setting. I wish that it wasn't such a clear choice to go for stealth if you're looking for all the money and upgrades, but it is.\n\nAnyways, this game is extremely fun, and very deep. There's tons of content and i've barely scratched the surface of the game 12 hours into it, because I can't stop finding new places to go and new areas to explore. This game does exploration and discovery in a uniquely satsisfying way and I highly recommend picking it up.","September 13, 2015","true","17.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198038932132/recommended/238010/","76561198038932132","MyGod MountainGod","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198038932132/","114 products in account","DE:HR is a fantastic experience with enjoyable writing and acting, mature themes and some of the coolest art direction I’ve seen. My main disappointment is how it motivates you to play in a very narrow way (a certain stealth approach); rendering all of the cool gadgets you collect null. I’ll explain later.\n\nThe game throws you right into the middle of things, and you need to pay attention to understand who’s who and what’s what. There’s no slow prologue telling how the world came to be in the state it is and how you find yourself there. It's something I like, because it helps establish this sense of realism that sticks throughout the entire game - that this is an actual world, not dependent on your existence to continue moving. You are part of it, not the center of it. Still, I’ll help you with the basic orientation.\n\nYou’re Adam Jensen, former SWAT and currently chief of security at a biotech company, that is at the forefront of human augmentation (mechanical upgrades to humans) research and development. You are an existing and set character, not a blank slate, so the choices you make are limited to what is reasonable for Adam to do. Many people enjoy creating their characters out of scratch. This is not that kind of game. Personally, I prefer this format. It’s a fine balance that offers some amount of input, but not too much to the point that it sacrifices the depth of the story just to give you more choices that end up being shallow. Speaking of which, the consequences of your decisions are also pleasantly felt later on. I didn't find them to be too drastic, but the small nods were satisfying nevertheless.\n\nAugmentation is the main topic the world is embroiled in at 2027, and the debate about its pros and cons extends to ethical, political, economical and social aspects. It’s a nice take on sci-fi that manages to keep things still relatively grounded and credible, while also enjoying some creative liberties where the developers wanted to emphasize the subject. Suspension of disbelief is required in some places more than others, but overall the game manages to sell a believable, alternate world. And it’s a bleak one. Earth is in the midst of a cyber renaissance, but once you move away from the socialites to the streets and alleyways, you will feel an atmosphere that is opposite from the optimistic aura of revolution that is present among the upper class. The change the world is going through isn’t embraced by all, doesn’t grace all, and there is an obvious tension in the air. The title of the next game is Mankind Divided, but the hints and seeds of that segregation are already found here.\n\nThe progression through levels is linear. While you revisit some of them, they’re in a changed state, and you can never go back to a level you’ve finished. They’re divided into the regular hub areas you know from most RPGs – open areas for your exploration to restock, talk with people, do side quests, etc – and the hostile levels that are much more fight or stealth oriented. Less talk, more action.\n\nAugmentations are the source of your abilities, and they’re varied enough to make leveling up an exciting occurrence. DE:HR isn't plagued by endless passive upgrades (e.g. 4% damage increase) that leave you with nothing to look forward to. You have plenty of enhancements that are new abilities, which allow you to do things you couldn’t previously achieve. There’s an interesting dialogue system that triggers with certain, important NPCs. One augmentation helps you better analyze these key figures to find the correct answer. Hacking is everywhere, and the mini-game that seems confusing at first turns out to be simple and fun. You can choose to jump higher to reach new areas, punch through weak walls or move heavy objects to open additional routes. And on the RPG note, you even have an old-school inventory system that forces you to choose what to take and what to ditch. Weapons or stealth equipment? You can't have everything.\n\nAll these abilities and gadgets have their uses thanks to great level design. Stealth games can be compared to puzzles, and each room in DE:HR has multiple solutions to it. You can crawl through vents around your enemies, hack into the security system and turn turrets or robots against them, move huge crates that offer you a shortcut or jump up high to snipe them. You also have some cool tactical augmentations that make things easier and allow you to better plan or execute your actions. You can see through walls, turn invisible or run silently without alerting enemies. It’s all very fun, and part of the reason for my inflated play time – other than just enjoying the stroll slowly and taking in all the details of this beautifully crafted world (or, uh, alt-tabbing) – is because I always wanted to explore each region to its fullest after I cleared it of enemies, in order to see all the alternate routes I didn’t utilize.\n\nYou can also just shoot your way through, but here is my main complaint about the game, and it’s a fairly big one. DE:HR, strangely, offers you a huge array of tools, from lethal to non-lethal, loud or silent, but doesn’t encourage their use. You can silently kill people with your crossbow, loudly blast them with a rocket launcher, tranquilize them, stun them, throw grenades, set mines, use robots, or just engage in massive gunfights with several fun options in weaponry. And while the fighting mechanics aren’t top of the end, from what I toyed around with, they’re still fun. On the hardest difficulty you die very quickly if you’re reckless, but your enemies aren’t bullet sponges, either – and that makes for intense battles. The problem with all of this is that DE:HR rewards an extremely specific game style. It’s not even that it’s just stealth – it’s stealth takedowns (melee). Meaning that even all your stealth equipment might go unused.\n\nIf you don’t care about min-maxing, this won’t matter to you. But I have this suspicion that most gamers do want to unlock more powers, and when you get 10 XP for shooting down an enemy from afar, or 50 for taking them down in a non-lethal manner from up close, I imagine you’ll be inclined to do the latter. That 50 piles up in the long run. You also get bonuses at the end of the mission, depending on whether or not you were spotted, and whether an alarm was raised. Together, these bonuses amount to a huge sum that you’ll never enjoy in an aggressive approach, since it doesn’t offer some alternate reward for different achievements. This also caused me to quick-load over and over, since letting things develop dynamically felt more like a punishment. By the end of the game, a non-lethal, melee takedown playstyle will end up rewarding the player significantly more, mechanically, but will also become very repetitive. It’s disappointing that the game offers so many fun instruments, but motivates you with its XP distribution to use one single function alone throughout the entire playthrough. There’s an NG+ option in the director’s cut, and I might do a second run sometime in the future with my developed build, so I can enjoy fighting my enemies guilt-free and without that fear of missing out. But for a single playthrough, it ends up feeling like wasted potential. The gameplay offers you many options but draws a thick, red circle around a very specific one with a big smiley above it.\n\nIt’s a major complaint from my perspective, but regardless, as a whole, the experience remains terrific. For anyone interested in a stealth-oriented game with a mature and interesting story and awesome setting, DE:HR is highly recommended. For those who want a sci-fi action game, you can find it here too, albeit discriminated against. You need to approach it with a mentality that doesn’t fret about receiving the bare minimum XP.","September 20, 2015","true","64.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zhaijuan/recommended/238010/","zhaijuan","zj","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zhaijuan/","79 products in account","I played this game right after completing Dark Souls 2, and all I wanted was to play a FPS title. When I first started the game, I felt that the controls and interface was rather clunky. While the controls can be remapped in the menu, you would have to slowly get used to the interface, such as how to hack, how to upgrade your gear when you level up, and cleaning your inventory.\n\nThe story mainly revolves around the ethics of augmentations, that being when technology advances and when people have the ability to modify their own body (even their mind) such that they function better. This extends beyond mere prostheses for the disabled such as protagonist Adam Jensen, but also willing modifications on perfectly fine bodies. While the benefits are apparant, those who oppose come forward with arguments such as the misuse in crimes or the alteration of oneself away from the image of God.\n\nWhat really attracts me is how the game is open to multiple gameplay approaches. As mentioned, I started the game wanting an FPS, so I went in guns-blazing killing everything I see. Halfway through, I started to incorporate stealth after upgrading specific augmentations and in the end, the game offered me an ending that defined my time as Adam Jensen. There are a total of 12 unique endings and in the one I got, Adam says and I quote: Technologies are invented to make our lives easier -- not our choices. The problem comes when we forget that.\n\n9/10","September 21, 2015","true","23.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As with every Deus Ex title there is a lot of reading and exploring to do for players who really want to dig further in the game's setting: doing so even awards you nice chunks of experience every time\nGameplay-wise, one must say that Human Revolution offers less freedom of action than its predecessor. While in the original Deus Ex you could go around destroying anyone and anything or decide to either incapacitate or plain evade both regular enemies without any consequence, truly allowing you to slowly build your own way to overcome the game's challenges, this sequel still gives you the same amount of freedom, but turns the table more in favor of an action-packed approach. Each boss encounter requires you to kill your enemy and every one of them are very durable augmented agents that will torn apart a player that relayed only on stealth and evasion up to that point. You can't run away either. There are also several instances in the game where going full killing mode against your enemies is required to achieve certain results\nThe Director's Cut DLC tried to fix such design choices by adding to the bosses arenas more way to eliminate them with indirect means. However, it's worth mentioning that you still HAVE to kill them and they have been severly buffed up from the first version of the game, to the point that even trying to off them with hacking or unconventional means is very hard without some protective or straight combat augs\nThe Missing Link DLC is a four hours worthy new content that was fully integrated in the main story of Human Revolution with the Director's Cut. The DLC takes place on a Belltower cargo ship, the Hei Zhen Zhu, and requires you to find and neutralize the local mercenary leader in order to continue your main story to Singapore. Whyle the ship features very crampy environments, the whole DLC still feels like a Deus Ex game, with plenty of alternative options to choose from. The final boss of the Missing Link is also much more Deus-Ex-esque than the ones from the vanilla game\nI would totally reccomend Deus Ex: Human Revolution due to its outsanding story and gameplay united with a huge replay value that allows you to experience a different kind of game every time you decide how to deal with the enemies and the other NPCS your own special way differently","March 6, 2014","true","29.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A gift, I was actually a bit hesitant on accepting as I've never been a big fan of FPS. The RPG part made me go through the download size and didn't quite prepare me for the stealth. I believe it's more accurate to call DX:HR a stealth with FPS and RPG elements, as the first is the most proeminent trait.\n\nAs Adam Jensen, you're tasked with security in Sarif Inustries, a top notch corporation specialized in augmentations. Not too long after you started, however, the matrix (located in a 2027 Detroit) is attacked by a mysterious black ops squad and a number of questions rise as you're basically resuscitated by your employer. Seems like your typical cyberpunk setting, except it feels more realistic, more relatable. The secrets you come to know during Adam's journey for answers and revenge easily get you involved while one question is answered and another one is made. And as any person asking the dangerous questions, Adam does so mostly in the shadows. Even though the game offers a large range of strategical approaches and paths, the stealth mechanic can be more rewarding and fulfilling, not to mention lore friendly. On higher difficulties keeping a low profile is actually necessary as augmentations aren't enough to withstand a bulletstorm. Fear not, though, as you can literally be a ghost by taking full advantage of the incredible level design!\n\nNot only the story is well written and filled with branches, but the artwork and soundtrack are some of the most relatable and beautiful in recent game history. The architecture feels unique and real, while the soundtrack tries to unite a feeling of old and new by mixing classic notes with electronic beats. It's easy to dive into Deus Ex's universe and get lost in its mature themes, such as transhumanism.\n\nEven though the experience is one worth having, it's still far from perfect. The Director's Cut came with a number of performance issues and bugs that -- after almost four years of the game's first release -- haven't yet been fixed by the developers. The game performers poorly on computers above its rcommended specifications and fixing it is no easy task. Still to this day there's no definitive method for AMD users to get completely rid of stuttering and small FPS drops, not to mention a proper (official or from the community) fix for the various bugs that lurk around the corners -- one of which got me frustrated and made me leave the game aside for more than a year. This might be one of those cases where you have to ignore the performance issues to fully enjoy the game, as DX:HR-DC is not a proper PC title/port.\n\nPros:\nFriendly to newcomers of the franchise\nVery sharp stealth mechanics aligned with a decent AI\nRPG elements with the augmentations upgrades\nThe player is not constantly forced to make use of the FPS mechanics\nLarge variety of paths and strategies within a single level\nIntelligent hacking mechanic\nImmersive cyberpunk setting with a deep story, mature context and complex, relatable characters\nBeautiful design and soundtrack\nHard and meaningful choices that matter\nMultiple endings\nAdam's dark past\nCons:\nPerformance issues\nBugs -- lots of them\nAMD users might have more difficulty in fixing problems\nNo "auto-sort" in the inventory\nToo many endings (a total of twelve)\nIf you like cyberpunk themes and stealth games, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a safe bet. And even if you're not particularly interested in what the game has to offer, it might surprise you!","June 5, 2015","true","51.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I give this game a 4.2 out of 5 because like I said some repetitiveness in certain things, but also the random frame drops that could occur which could glitch out the whole game making you fall out of the universe in some fashion like Assassin Creed Unity.

The majority of the game is free roam and the choices you make during the game will effect the world around you. Based before the original Deus Ex you are placed in the role of Adam Jensen an ex-swat team member, who now finds him self in charge of security for one of the largest biotechnology firms in America.\n\nStory:\nThe Deus games have always been driven on conspiracy theory’s, Human Revolution is no different. All through the game you will be questioning who to trust and who not to, friends may become enemiesand enemies friends. The story really does a great job of keeping you suspicious, your never sure if your a good guy or a bad one. Add to that some of the choices the game gives you with no clear moral option, you’ll find yourself constantly second guessing yourself.\nBut the story does feel rushed at times and some questions it rises never really feel answered, some moments feel unexplained. In fact if you turn the commentary on in extras they them selves will tell you they ran out of time to fully realize all they wanted to do. Its a shame as it really does show, But what’s there is good and achieves exactly what they were trying to.\n\nGameplay:\nAs of late I’ve been struggling to get in to FPS games as the market is so saturated, but Deus Ex HRDC does truly offer something different from the norm. The controls are a pretty standard fair with one or two odd key placements, but nothing that hampers the experience. But its the augmentations that really put this game apart, some being basic things like faster sprinting or improving hacking skills. But its the stealth augments and things like punching through walls that really make this fun, and stealth is a big element of Deus. Its possible if your careful and cleaver to get through almost every mission without firing a shot, but at times you will probably have to so lucky even your weapons are upgradeable too.\nIf I have one major criticism of the gameplay, its the cover system. When you take cover or use a take down move you move into 3rd person view, this is great for a visual effect but feels really jarring in practice. It just doesn’t flow right and left me feeling like they should have ether made the whole game in 3rd person or found a way to do it in 1st person. Even the option like Skyrim where you can use ether view I would have welcomed over the way its executed here, I also feel that FPS vets will probably not use the cover system anyway.\n\nPresentation:\nThe graphics are great for a 2 year old game and really do give that futuristic atmosphere. Some maps do feel like your walking down the same corridor fifteen times as there all so similar, but this is to be expected. Thankfully most levels are in more open settings with a wider verity of surroundings. There at times is a almost Blade Runner feel to the game, this is really emphasized by the neon lit menus and displays in the game. The character models are great too, with every character seeming unique and fresh.\n\nConclusion:\nI really enjoyed Deus, more than I thought I would. If your looking for something a little deeper than the standard FPS then really look no farther. With a deep plot that to me seem heavily inspired by the works of Isaac Asimov and gameplay that’s a little different I found it a real breath of fresh air. There’s really not a lot here not to like and I would recommend it highly to anyone into FPS games.\n\nSee this and other reviews here http://www.cyberusuk.com/post/114658327513/deus-ex-human-revolution-directors-cut-review","March 31, 2015","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's very fluid and keeps you identifying with the character.\n\nThere also seems to be some replayability as you can make different choices or have different playstyles that effect the way the story unfolds.\n\nAll in all I give it solid 8.5 / 10\n\nIf you like the SciFi genre and you like Action / FPS combat games pick this one up its a steal for the sale price.","January 1","true","36.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Either way being fun, leaving players wanting to redo a checkpoint to perfect a certain method to complete it.\nThis kind of gameplay has innevitably resulted in AI being a bit stuipid and too oblivious at times. Additionally, some boss fights are bit over the top and unnesccary.\nHowever, the variety of skills the player has to choose from and the unique environments of each chapter/level overshadows these faults.\nDeus Ex has been an example and of why games should be taken more seriously, and have alot more potential than being viewed as violent shoot em ups' as seen in the past.\n\n\n- 9/10","March 17, 2014","true","52.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HollowCam/recommended/238010/","HollowCam","HollowCam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HollowCam/","235 products in account","The highly anticipated follow up to "the best pc game ever made" and "the worst sequel ever made" is Deus Ex 3 or Deus Ex: Human Revolution. The story focuses on Adam Jensen, a man forced to deal with augmentations on account of his past and present endeavours. In the first Deus Ex the story focuses on JC Denton, a man forced to deal with augmentations based on the time and place he was born. This dynamic offers a more interesting style of storytelling and presents a series of different connections that can be made within the Deus Ex Universe. Human Revolution revolves around the famous quote turned meme " I never asked for this" which although many claim "sums up" Adam's character, it may or may not in some cases. Something that this game did very well was offer players the choice to flesh out Adam's character in their own way. Often with games that focus on non-linear storytelling their biggest downfall falls into the fact that dialogue options are usually very black and white. While I am a big fan of the Mass Effect series, we notice that those games take advantage of the paragon and renegade system. Although that system is not bad, it doesn't leave a lot of room open for player involvement. This game allows the player to grow, learn, and adapt to the obstacles pressed upon you by society partly based on the immersive and breathtaking environments. Simultaneously, you can become your own person: conform, oppress, comfort; a lot of different ways to approach people.\n\nDeus Ex 1, Invisible War, and Human Revolution are all 20 years apart so clearly there needs to be some change in direction. DX1 is a government controlled future influenced by private corporations, ideas and philosophies. Human Revolution perfectly sets up the world leading to Deus Ex 1 and leaves lots of room for Mankind Divided to step in. The game plays like a Deus Ex game. It tackles that perfect style of non-linear gameplay where you don't have to go on one path. Instead, you can crawl in through a vent, go through the front door, take a side door, avoid the area completely, crawl above, and much more. This style of non-linear gameplay was started with Deus Ex 1;  here it is definitely present and based on the improvements to the augmentation and inventory system, we have ourselves the definitive Deus Ex experience.\n\nOverall, I reccomend this game based on it's nearly flawless level design with only a few issues shown during later levels where the gameplay is forced to slow down. It's less of an issue with level design and more with AI placement, however it is extremely rare. The gameplay is perfected here and does not get repetitive based on the non-linear approach you may take. Many complain about the boss fights throwing you out of the immersion of the titles stronger aspects, however, the fights themselves (in the director's cut) are well rounded and not overly simple. I recognize flaws with the bosses, however I feel that people are forgetting that boss fights existed in some manner on Deus Ex 1 along with Invisible War, if you compare that to this title's ability as a sequel, you see a better result here. The game is difficult and fair unlike many modern shooters. Human Revolution immerses you in the story and allows you to build your own character, while it is not confirmed if your save will carry over to Mankind Divided, Human Revolution set up it's sequel with a line of perfection that I look forward to more than any other title in 2016.\n\nPlay this game, play Deus Ex 1; you won't regret it.","July 20, 2015","true","24.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The characters are interesting (although they sometimes have pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ animations, but *shrugs*), the main character is awesome and has a very interesting character design, I LOVE his german voice. I think the english one sounds too... rough, emotionless and monotonous, if not even bored. I loved the level designs, loved the different locations... And, like I said, the story is... wow. It does not happen often, but I am able to play this game again and again without getting bored of the story. The conspiracies, the stuff you learn about transhumanism,... Seriously.

It may also have something to do with the fact that I first played this on the Playstation 3, but I digress. The fact is, this game is probably unlike any other game I've ever played in my life.\n\nYou play as Adam Jensen, an ex-cop now working for Sarif Industries, a massive company that is pretty much the poster-boy for cyberpunk mega-conglomerates. When the company is about to move to a new location, it gets hit by a terrorist attack, leaving Jensen near-death while he watches his lover, Megan Reed, get killed. In typical Robocop fashion, he is rebuilt using  AUGMENTATIONS™  . Six months later, he is back at the company, and is now on a quest to discover the truth of what really happened that fateful night.\n\nAs far as presentation goes, I've heard a lot of people give this game a hard time for having a consistently yellow/orange aesthetic to it. Personally, I didn't mind this that much, and thought the game looked fine. Actually, I'd say that in a lot of areas, the game looks fantastic, especially on some of the later levels. (I personally thought that the penthouse level was absolutely gorgeous) There's so many fine details in every nook and cranny in this game, that it really makes the game look and feel like it's own universe. Of course, looking at the Final Fantasy games, this is to be expected from Square Enix. If I really have any complaints, I thought that the characters sometimes felt a bit robotic, and the lip-syncing can kinda get screwy at times. However, this is a pretty small problem that can be overlooked.\n\nI say that because, for the most part, the voice actors really do a good job; putting a lot of effort forth for some pretty riveting dialogue at times. I personally thought that the voice actor of Jensen, Elias Toufexis, did an amazing job potraying his role. As a matter of fact, the sound design in most of the game is actually really good; the guns sound like they have a punch to them, and of course, a bunch of little details here and there that, again, make this game truly come to life.\n\nNow, when it comes to the music, it ranges from "pretty good" to "♥♥♥♥ing incredible". Some of the tracks on here are an audible feast. I just hope that Mankind Divided has just as good of a soundtrack, if not better.\n\nIn typical Deus Ex fashion, you are given a wide array of choices and methods of getting past levels. You can go in guns blazing, sneak around Metal Gear style and take out enemies quickly and quietly, you can hack turrets, turn off security cameras, and you can even go through levels quietly without killing anybody, if you'd like. And that's not even all you can do. Throughout the game, you get Praxis points which you can use to level up your augmentations. You can spend these on new abilities, such as seeing through walls, being able to hack harder terminals, to fall any height without taking damage, lift heavy objects such as vending machines and dumpsters, and much more. Jensen controls pretty solidly, so you won't have too much trouble pulling off any play style you wish to go in with. Out of all of these, I'd say that Hacking is probably an essential skill to level up, as the game is extremely difficult without it. There's actually a hacking minigame this time around instead of waiting for the ICE Breaker bar to deplete. It's not incredibly hard, and it does add tension to the game at times, because the world around you doesn't freeze when you're in hacking, so keep an eye on your surroundings before you hack something.\n\nPersonally, I don't think you need to play the first Deus Ex in order to appreciate this one, as it is a prequel to the first one. Even if you aren't familiar with the first game at all, I think this game is well-crafted enough for a large number of people to enjoy.\n\nIf I have any other complaints, is that there are some sections of this game that do get extremely frustrating. This may have been a foul-up on my part, but still, some parts of this game had me FURIOUS.\n\nI personally think this is one of the best games of the 2010's. It's action-packed, it's smart, and it's a pretty lengthy game if you're into that sort of thing. I finally clocked in at about 16 hours when I did my first playthrough of this game. It's one hell of a ride.\n\n10 augmented, cyberpunk, haXX0r McLovin's out of 10.","March 13","true","30.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a different world now than when the orriginal was released and frankly, it shows: better gunplay, better graphics and better voice acting. The story lives up to the old game's pedigree but isn't (of course) quite as good. Full of characters I really like (no spoilers but the pilot is great).

The Pacifist Playstyle & Achievement! You can actually play through the game without killing anyone (except the bosses).\n2. Michael McCann's awesome soundtrack, plus samples of the original Deus Ex music hidden throughout.\n3. Fantastic voice acting that turned me into a fan of Elias Toufexis.\n4. Takedowns featuring futuristic blade-arms, pure cyborg badassery.\n5. The Missing Link: A fun detour towards the end of the game where you can experiment with the "Factory Zero" playstyle (see achievement description).\n6. Serious transhumanist theme that permeates the entire game, a breath of fresh air that tackles a serious topic in an interesting and enlightening way.\n\nIf you never played the original Deus Ex, play this installment first, give the second one a wide berth.","March 6","true","23.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not only a decent game, but it is a great Deus Ex game. Especially considering the failure that was The Fall, and the controversial Invisible War, DEHR is a fantastic installment to the series.\n\nThe graphics, the gameplay mechanics, the inventory, item construction and customization, the character upgrades, all of these are solid. Then we get into the story and dialogue. They are like nothing I have experienced before. Once you get the dialogue Praxis upgrade, it opens up a whole new gameplay feature, one that allows you to not only witness the effects of your choices during the dialogue sequence (not just after), but gives you a whole new way to play the game. It allows you to actually strategize during a conversation based on the individual person you're talking to and their personality, along with their emotional state at any given time, not just click one phrase and hope that the NPC has a favorable response to that particular selection.\n\nI am one of the few who actually like DE: Invisible War, but I have to admit that the inventory and (oh god) the dialogue and voice acting were bland and boring at best. Human Revolution doesn't fall victim to any of the failures of its older brother (and some would say a VERY distant relative). The voice acting is superb, the inventory is akin to The Conspiracy, item upgrades are more like the original, and the story and missions give you that sense of urgency that the original had.\n\nIt's not just a good shooter, but it is a fantastic RPG. I've got to say that this is one (pre)sequel that I am proud to own and experience. Definitely recommended. A solid 9/10","March 9","true","23.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JMCJEDI/recommended/238010/","JMCJEDI","jmcone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JMCJEDI/","95 products in account","I didn't ask for this...Deus Ex: Human Revolution is what you'd call a modern classic. It's one of the greatest games of our time, and will most likely stand the test of time. I've bought and played through it twice to completion, once on PS3 and now on PC, and the Director's Cut includes the fun and story-adding Missing Link DLC. This game is a worthy addition to any gamer's library, and now I think it's time to explain why.\n\nGameplay\nSurveying the warehouse floor, you see five guards patrolling. You could snatch the shotgun that lies, unattended, in the office, or you could hack the security system that will turn the turret systems against the guards. You could cloak and move silently past them. You could choke or stab each one, dragging them away from sight and picking them off one by one. You could unlock the doors, sneak through the vent, throw a concussion grenade, drop a box on their head... the possibilities are essentially endless. You want to try an approach in this game, go ahead. Sure, the pure combat approach may not be the most fun shooter you've ever played, but the stealth system in this game is great, and the free-form missions enable you to play multiple saves and never have the same experience twice.\nYou can augment your character with a large variety of different augmentations, which all have practical use in many instances throughout the game. There isn't really one that you will regret buying, though, still, spend wisely! The only thing that lets this section down are still the iffy boss fights. There still isn't a true stealth option, at least not to my knowledge.\n\nStory\nYou play Adam Jensen, security chief of one of America's largest biotech industries. One day, before going to present a new technology to the world, your offices are attacked, and you left for dead. Resurrected by the very biotechnology you protected, Adam now investigates the biggest conspiracy of the 2020s in an effort to bring justice to the people who murdered his friends and coworkers. It's a very good story and excellent mystery. Well worth playing just for the story.\n\nGraphics, Atmosphere, and Sound\nThe graphics are, perhaps, slightly dated, but still look crisp enough that you'll enjoy it.\nThe atmosphere of the game is spot on. Deus Ex paints a future that is worrying, but you'll still think that Adam Jensen looks damned awesome in those augmented shades. The gritty, cyberpunk world is well worth exploring every nook and cranny for.\nThe sound of the game is also spot on. The rattle of the combat rifle, the hiss as you reload the magazine, the subtle footsteps, the idle chatter of the enemies, and who can forget the incredible theme song, Icarus. Another great element to a great game.\n\nConclusion\nAn rollicking mystery with intriguing plot twists and interesting characters who you can't trust 100%, this game is most definitely worth playing twice, even more than twice... This game isn't perfect, but after all, it was only made by humans...","September 11, 2015","true","23.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The majority of the game is free roam and the choices you make during the game will effect the world around you. Based before the original Deus Ex you are placed in the role of Adam Jensen an ex-swat team member, who now finds him self in charge of security for one of the largest biotechnology firms in America.\n\nStory:\nThe Deus games have always been driven on conspiracy theory’s, Human Revolution is no different. All through the game you will be questioning who to trust and who not to, friends may become enemiesand enemies friends. The story really does a great job of keeping you suspicious, your never sure if your a good guy or a bad one. Add to that some of the choices the game gives you with no clear moral option, you’ll find yourself constantly second guessing yourself.\nBut the story does feel rushed at times and some questions it rises never really feel answered, some moments feel unexplained. In fact if you turn the commentary on in extras they them selves will tell you they ran out of time to fully realize all they wanted to do. Its a shame as it really does show, But what’s there is good and achieves exactly what they were trying to.\n\nGameplay:\nAs of late I’ve been struggling to get in to FPS games as the market is so saturated, but Deus Ex HRDC does truly offer something different from the norm. The controls are a pretty standard fair with one or two odd key placements, but nothing that hampers the experience. But its the augmentations that really put this game apart, some being basic things like faster sprinting or improving hacking skills. But its the stealth augments and things like punching through walls that really make this fun, and stealth is a big element of Deus. Its possible if your careful and cleaver to get through almost every mission without firing a shot, but at times you will probably have to so lucky even your weapons are upgradeable too.\nIf I have one major criticism of the gameplay, its the cover system. When you take cover or use a take down move you move into 3rd person view, this is great for a visual effect but feels really jarring in practice. It just doesn’t flow right and left me feeling like they should have ether made the whole game in 3rd person or found a way to do it in 1st person. Even the option like Skyrim where you can use ether view I would have welcomed over the way its executed here, I also feel that FPS vets will probably not use the cover system anyway.\n\nPresentation:\nThe graphics are great for a 2 year old game and really do give that futuristic atmosphere. Some maps do feel like your walking down the same corridor fifteen times as there all so similar, but this is to be expected. Thankfully most levels are in more open settings with a wider verity of surroundings. There at times is a almost Blade Runner feel to the game, this is really emphasized by the neon lit menus and displays in the game. The character models are great too, with every character seeming unique and fresh.\n\nConclusion:\nI really enjoyed Deus, more than I thought I would. If your looking for something a little deeper than the standard FPS then really look no farther. With a deep plot that to me seem heavily inspired by the works of Isaac Asimov and gameplay that’s a little different I found it a real breath of fresh air. There’s really not a lot here not to like and I would recommend it highly to anyone into FPS games.\n\nSee this and other reviews here http://www.cyberusuk.com/post/114658327513/deus-ex-human-revolution-directors-cut-review","March 31, 2015","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It stays true to the design philosophies of earlier installments, allowing the player to choose multiple paths to navigate the fairly sizable maps. While there are truly memorable moments (the excellent Hengsha hub), the script is inconsistent with a subpar third act.\n\nThe visuals have aged gracefully for the most part, but the playing areas do feel too confined (old hardware limitations, in all likelihood). Map design ranges from inspired (such as the Detroit area and the Tai Yong Medical tower) to very commonplace with bland industrial facilities.\n\nThe gameplay, however, is great fun. While not groundbreaking, the cover shooting is as enjoyable as the stealth approach. The hacking minigame could become potentially annoying to some. The augmentations could have been a little more creative, as you'll probably grab all the interesting ones by midgame. The boss fights, as has been extensively covered, are a pain in the ♥♥♥, even in the Director's Cut.\n\nAn exceptional game, but not as revolutionary as the original Deus Ex.","August 27, 2015","true","34.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most voice acting is good although adam's is to cliche of characters like snake and master chief.\n\nGame play\nAbility to play like a stealthy ninja, hacking computer geek or go in guns blazing gives you a lot of feedom and replayability. open world areas allow you to aventure and do some fun side quests but so often you are stuck in single mission areas with no shops or anything for a long time. Also do not upgrade the number of energy bars you have. only the last one or two will recharge depending on your difficulty.\n\nGraphics\noverall good graphics  although everything looks pixilated and when you talk to people they cant seem to stand still.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkRavenFilms/recommended/238010/","DarkRavenFilms","Anthrax Prime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkRavenFilms/","81 products in account","While reading my review, please keep in mind that I never played the original Deus Ex games.\n\nI went into this game thinking it would be your every day shooter game with average story and decent game mechanics. What I got was something much more pleasing. Deus Ex: Human Revolution has got to be one of my most favorite games of all time. Every penny I spent on this game was well worth it and I will never forget the experience Human Revolution has given me.\n\nThe game takes place in the future where robotic limbs and augmentation is possible. A lot of thought went into this concept as you've got the pro-life supporters stating that augmentation is wrong and that you shouldn't do anything to your body. On the other hand you've got those who support human augmentation stating that this is how the human race will evolve. You play as Adam Jensen- a security guard. You used to be "fully human" without any augmentations until a day came where you were attacked by an augmented human and left nearly for dead. Practically every limb in Jensen's body has been replaced due to the severity of the attack he barely lived through.\n\n6 months fly by and you are called in again to help stop those responsible for the attack on Serif Industries and get revenge on those that made you what you are. The story is rich and deep- and the characters are very memorable. Adam questions if he is still human, or something more. As mentioned- the developers put a lot of thought into the story of this game and it stands out. I haven't played the game in months and I still remember the story as if I played the game yesterday.\n\nThe game mechanics are wonderful. It's more of stealth game or taking enemies out one by one than anything. Adam is not a Call of Duty soldier by any means and can't step into a middle of a room unprotected. The game requires strategy. You can tackle a level in several different way whether you try and go in fully stealthy or take out enemies every time they are encountered. You are rewarded in XP for exploring or not being seen at all or not killing enemies but rather, knocking them out. The more you level or find certain collectibles to upgrade your augments, the more you can do with them. For instance, you couldn't fall from a certain height without dying unless you got enough XP to purchase the Icarus upgrade which would allow you to fall from any height and not be hurt let alone die. Or you can't lift anything with the exception of like a remote unless you put XP into an upgrade that would allow you to move heavy things such as dumpsters. A great concept that makes the game challenging or sometimes making you wish you put your upgrade into some other augmentation based on the current situation you are in.\n\nThe game has branching paths. You can choose certain dialogue options and some of these options do have an impact on how the mission progresses or ends. You'll have speech checks that if you fail- could be the death of a hostage or information being withheld from you. Speaking certain things or asking questions helps you understand the story more. I've never been more interest in doing side quests and reading emails and everything as I have with Human Revolution. This game makes you want to complete the side quests. This game makes you want to explore and find out every little secret that you can find out about. And if that wasn't enough, the soundtrack to this game is beautiful and well compose and fits Human Revolution perfectly.\n\nDon't go into this game thinking you are a super soldier who can soak up bullets. You might be a very augmented individual- but you are still human and can take damage like crazy if you are careless. The best strategy of this game is to go in stealthy or taking enemies out one by one when necessary. Strategy is going to be your best friend in this game. If this is not your play style or you aren't willing to play that kind of play style, don't get this game. However- if you are looking for a great story with lots of lore to get into along with great game mechanics, I cannot recommend this game enough.","December 28, 2015","true","43.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All I heard was that it was really good and was amazing. But that didn't seem like much to me at the moment. At first it was difficult. Rather than an average game this game offered  more  than it appeared to.\n\nGameplay & Detail\n\nWhat's nice about Deus Ex, is that it gives you different approaches. In the beginning of the game they give you a weapon of your choice. Ones like either a quiet, ranged, and nonlethal rifle (Tranquilizer Rifle) or a quiet, close-ranged, nonlethal gun (Stun Gun). But if your the type to go out full gun, there's that too. Your given the option also to take an automatic rifle and etc. This really is the beginning of the amazing stuff about Deus Ex. Instead of forcing you into a play-style, it really just offers you many different ones. Not only that, but after the first few missions you arrive in Detroit. The city feels a bit abandoned (you feel like there would be more people) but slowly after learning the atmosphere of Deus Ex (and looking up at the sky, of course), you'd understand that the city that you walk in is some of the lowest parts of the city. It all ties in and makes a wonderful game with wonderful mechanics. In the very beginning, you also learn about a very important thing. Hacking. Hacking is used a  LOT  to manipulate your enviroment, such as opening doors, turning turrets onto your side or completely disabling them, or even just taking over giant robots roaming the level. What's cool though is that hacking is a mini puzzle game that are short and sometimes difficult (you have a limited time to beat the puzzle). All these mechanics and decisions Edios Montreal and Square Enix made really make the game hit a homerun (Take my word... IT'S REALLY GOOD). But there are downfalls right? Yeah there is. There's bugs. There's an anonymous X glitch. It occurs later in the game when you meet someone and then it glitches and dosen't allow you to talk to anyone in the game. But thankfully there's a way to  fix it.  I'm sure there's more bugs, but I haven't run into much except a few funny ones, like if you throw a box at someone it will insta-kill them usually (Like really tiny boxes). Otherwise the gameplay is fine and nothing bad happens usually.\n\nStory\nOhhhhh.... this is the best of it. The Story. It takes an interesting topic about technology and messes with what's good about it. It's psychological and makes you think through everything. I won't spoil anything, but will just say this story alone is worth you buying. It makes you question about technology and just makes everything about technology seem corrupted at the same time feeling extremely useful. What's also cool is while you are going through the main story it allows you to make decisions that affect the game. You can choose to let  a terrorist  free  wth a hostage  or kill them. That affects everyone reacts towards you. It makes it interesting. As if it could not get any more interesting is that they made it where if you want to know and dive deep even more into the story is that you can go hack computers. So many things can be found in the computers. Computers have emails constantly on Deus Ex. They don't update, but you find emails that provide information on the story. Not just that but it provides sometimes codes for doors and etc. It makes it worth while hacking in.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are reasonably good. While it's not  amazing , it's still pretty good. People look good and everything performs fine. I have an Alienware x51 i5 and I can perform it at usually a steady 60 frames per second. I do though have frame drops when on a mission sometimes, but not  bad drops  (it went done like 7 fps for a few seconds). Sometimes I've had a farther frame drop down to 30 at times when first entering the city. But it hasn't happened much since. Otherwise the graphics are fine and work well.\n\nOverall\nDeus Ex Human Revolution is amazing. It's worth every penny. Right now its $3.99, and I would throw your money at it now. It's a great singeplayer game with an amazing story with great mechanics. IT's definetely worth buying.\n\n"Rating":  Buy It.
