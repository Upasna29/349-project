Also i have to notice the variety of the puzzles which are amazing. If you like the hidden object /puzzle games then I think it is a very good buy for 4 bucks (special promotion price). Here is the first 10 minutes, I think it will help you decide if you are thinking on to buy it.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hXiV39XRbY","January 28","true","0.6"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","23","29","2","0"

Slavic mythology centers around the hearth, the home, and the natural world.  This game does that extemely well in presentation, storyline and the creatures used, and is family friendly in theme.\n\nStoryline: Dr. Mary Gilbert, botantist and saviour of endangered moss in Maple Creek (Maple Creek - omage to Enigmatis) has received a letter from her grandmother referred to as Baba (Yaga Baba reference) urgently requesting her help to save a rare and endangered plant in the Slavic Park, an educational outdoor museum centered around Slavic mythological creatures.  Upon arriving Mary is attacked by a creature and her car is shoved off a cliff.  Escaping the car begins the quest adventure of saving her soon to be kidnapped grandmother, meeting the mythology creatures who have taken refuge in the park, healing the rare and magical plant, and ultimately defeating the villian in an apropos way.\n\nGameplay:  This game is more point and click then hidden object but plays as a combination of both.  There are basically three main areas of the game, the Slavic Park, the abandoned village and the castle with side quests into other areas.  There is a fast travel map but the player can not return to the Slavic Park once they cross the lake to the abandoned village.  So make sure all the extras finds (notes, etc and bestiary cards) are found before crossing the lake.\n\nHidden Object:  The Hidden Object scenes are mostly fragmented HOs (find the pictured pieces to create a single object), find "X" amount of objects, and near the end of the game are list HO finds.  The list HOs have "ghost" puzzle pieces beneath them that the player clicks on to complete the 'extra' puzzle and the HO scene.\n\nPuzzles: Nothing overly challenging and a variety of basic fun fare.  Sliders, pipe puzzle, picture puzzles, codes, telescope challenge, and a maze.\n\nThere are three extra find challenges in this game:\n1) 30 bright pink purplish flowers that are very hard to miss.\n2) Finding all the notes, posters, pictures, diplomas, signs, etc in the main game. Note: I am unsure exactly which ones are used to gain the achievement Bookworm, so do not be shy click on everything. Some are missable so click on notes, papers, etc first before any 'quest' object.\n3) Collecting the bestiary cards scattered throughout the main game.  Note: some are missable such as the one at the end of the maze since if not taken at the time the player can not return to get it later.  These cards can be accessed during gameplay and the player can read about 30 different slavic mythological creatures.  I do believe the cards must be read to gain the achievement associated with them.\n\nAchievements:  Most are gained through gameplay alone and all achievements can be earned in a single playthrough.\n\nFun game for the expert and beginner alike with three game modes to choose from.  If playing on expert mode the first time through here's a hint:  The list HO finds are found in the third part of the game (the castle and surrounding areas) these can be easy to miss so make sure to click on the background areas and places you have been before to find them.\n\nWell worth full price for an easy romp through slavic mythology.","February 2","true","11.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Unfortunately for you, this same creature kidnaps your grandmother and the friendly man that helped you betrayed you. Your only chance is to reach his castle in this park where slavic fables are honored....\n\nEventide: Slavic Fable is a nice story with elements from slavic fables: everyone around, apart for your Baba, is in reality part of the slavic folklore. Given the fact that you can collect cards about each creature in this culture, you can also learn about it.\n\nThe gameplay is quite common, though the hidden objects scenes are diversified: from rebuilding an object thanks to a list of pictures to a list of items to find, as they're hiding parts of a puzzle. The puzzles are also well-balanced and kinda easy when you're used to them. Even if the game isn't developed by Artifex Mundi, the gameplay is quite similar to their own games.\n\nThe ambiance is a surreal one and a nice one, even if the game is set during the night, in a dark forest but it's not the creepy type. The only thing that is weird is the grandmother's head: I don't know how to describe it but I think it's not as well done as the others.\n\nThe soundtrack is also correct and fitting to the story.\n\nThe bonus chapter seems to be out of the blue, however, you understand quickly that it's set in the past and that you'll meet again some characters. The bonus are also nice: minigames, soundtrack, etc...\n\nAnyway, Eventide: Slavic Fable is a nice way to learn about slavic bestiary and belief. It's also a good game published by Artifex Mundi and almost as the same quality of their own games. As usual, don't hesitate!","January 31","true","4.7"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","3"

Though the story is quite thin, it still manages to provide some character and a distinct Slavic fairytale flair.\n\nNote that it's especially casual: the game is quite short, even when including the bonus chapter, and the puzzles are all very easy. Also, there are only a handful of hidden-object scenes, so it's not exactly a hidden-object game.\n\nFinally, thank you, devs, for supporting Linux!","March 15","true","3.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

K.","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197973230221/","3588 products in account","The first Steam game from developer The House Of Fables and it has nearly Artifex Mundi Quality. The story is good-great like the enemy. The graphics are good, most time very detailed, some persons could could drawn a little bit better, but its good enough, the most picturs are well-fantastic designed (for hidden object games standard), the search screens make fun, some are really beautiful like the glass one. Sound is good. Game length is adequate. A nice extra for me are the 30 cards you can collect, they tell in the achievement menue about fairy tail entity, a really interesting little bonus. So for HO Games Lovers (hardcore fans of this genre) i give this game about 89 % (93 % myself because its the first Steam Game), for normal fans and/ or normal gamers 77-70 %, for people that dont like Hidden Object G. dont play it ;) Thank you for reading. Hopefully enjoy. P. S. i cant await Eventide 2","March 14","true","4.2"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","7"

Well, this game might just change your mind. Eventide: Slavic Fable is a game filled with magic and mystery as the hero, Mary, goes on an adventure to save her grandmother and the Slavic heritage park named Moorland that is filled with mythical creatures. This is a hidden item game with many enjoyable moments.\n\nThe story starts with Mary, a botanist, getting a letter from her grandmother to rush to Moorland. Things go downhill from there as Mary gets into a car accident only to be saved, only to then witness her grandmother being taken away by a giant moth-like creature! The only way she can fix things is by finding a mystical flower and rejuvenating it so that its magic can be used. The creatures of Slavic legend who live in the park aid her quest to restore peace to Moorland and save the world.\n\nThe game has many beautiful hidden object scenes to keep your attention as well as fun and sometimes challenging puzzles that you must complete to progress in the game. If you’ve played other games in this genre then you won’t be surprised, however this is a nice title for players new to hidden object games or even children. The music is very fitting. Though I found several of the mythical creatures creepy, the artwork is gorgeous -the vibrant colors and attention to details made this game a pleasure to play.\n\nThe game can be on the short side, even with playing the bonus chapter. However, the game also has achievements to go after and trading cards, adding a bit more to the game. This casual title is a fun and whimsical tale that is sure to please, I do recommend grabbing Eventide: Slavic Fable if you get the opportunity; beautiful art, smooth game-play, fully voiced and an overall great experience.\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproductions.tumblr.com]","February 20","true","3.6"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

It may tax your memory and observation skills at times, but the unobtrusive hint system is only ever a click away. No tutorial needed: I jumped straight in at 'advanced'. Along the way you get occasional pats on the back to reassure you you're on the right track.\n\nIf forced to point out flaws, I'd say that the developers could do with a thorough spell-check of the content; there are several phrases and words used that aren't quite right (in some puzzles the odd choice of words adds further depth). Apart from that, the program seems bug-free (except perhaps near the castle drawbridge, where the crossbow seemed to misfire -- I was forced to back out via the main menu to get around that).\n\nWell worth the entry fee.","April 6","true","6.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The fairy tale environment graphics are lush and bring to mind the grim legends releases by artifex mundi, which are among their best. The characters here are also well designed and well voice acted.  There are not too many hidden object scenes, which is fine by me.

The puzzles aren't too hard, and there's always the hint flower if you're getting stuck.\n\nThe thing I most liked about it was how it created a world of abundant nature, and mythical creatures.  You come away with a taste for a time when the boundaries between human and animal were much more blurred.  A nice tribute to Slavic folklore.\n\nRecommended.","March 20","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you've never played one before it's a puzzle and hidden object driven game with, to me at least, a reasonable storyline. I found that this one had a good mix of different puzzles and if you are practised with the genre it shouldnt take you long to comlete the story.\n\nAll in all it is a worthwhile couple of hours of fun.","March 22","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Really gorgeous music and lovely art. Cute voiceovers, extremely enunciated, hehe--I always love That Guy Who Plays The Bad Guy (he's a few characters in this one). The puzzles were good, if on the easy side. Collecting bestiary cards is a great idea. Also, I'm not sure this is a plus for everyone, but I laughed every time the word "Slavic" came up, like an exotic callout that doesn't actually mean anything. Don't go in expecting historical accuracy or anythin'. But it is cute, and they did borrow elements from real mythology, just toned down or modified and given really generic English names. It was a very cute game overall.\n\nMy only change would be to make the map a better map--rooms are gathered into chunks so map-teleportation is handy but not as handy as it could be.","March 21","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are different types of puzzles and HO scenes, so it doesn't get too repetitive, which is so often the case (and then I start using hints and skipping puzzles). This is also the first HO game in which I did not use any hints in the HO scenes and didn't skip any puzzles. The difficulty level was just right, so those didn't get frustrating. The story is interesting enough and I liked the graphics, especially the different creatures in the Moorland park. Finding the collectables wasn't too hard, although I managed to miss a few of the cards. I'm looking forward to the second part, which I will buy when it becomes available.","April 19","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
