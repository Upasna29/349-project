"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrakenKin/recommended/24480/","DrakenKin","Draken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrakenKin/","626 products in account","A mix between RPG and RTS, this game shines with its immersive adventure quests, yet technical problems spoil the fun.\n\nThis review was written February 8, 2012. It is based on about 20+ hours in the main campaign, and 20+ hours in the prologue (dead legion DLC). I will update this review when I beat the game if it changes anything.\n\nTHE GOOD\n\n- Text adventures make a welcome come back; they are pretty well done and are the main element that gives KA its flavor and uniqueness.\n- Voice acting has improved since KA1, at least this voice seems deeper and better at reading the text without rushing it. Sometimes however the voice acting becomes very bad, especially when the same actor tries to voice other characters (women, monsters) while telling a story.\n- Big improvement on the graphics, especially on the campaign map which is a lot more detailed, believable, and immersive. (Especially in the prologue DLC.)\n- New spell protection system is a welcome addition, no more having multiple stacks getting decimated in a blink because of one well-placed spell. Addition of a casting delay to spells helps by giving you a chance to react.\n- New diplomacy system with other factions. It adds some welcome depth to the game.\n- Pacing seems better than in the original. At least I didn't see any enemy going into an army spawning frenzy, or what the community called the "whack the mole" mechanic in the first game.\n- Estimated play time seems decent. It should take you about 40-50 hours on a challenging difficulty, maybe less if you auto resolve a lot of the battles. There is some replay value since you can do the text quests again with different decisions to see what happens.\n\n\nTHE BAD\n\n- Horrible performance even on beast machines. I was getting 9-12 FPS on high settings (on a 6 core 3.2gh), and finally managed to get 20-25 with everything on lowest possible. At lowest settings problems surface like being unable to see clearly which units are selected, winter time turns into a white light mess, and so on. This might be a deal breaker for a lot of people.\n- Loss of the province management aspect. No more management of gold and food incomes. In fact there is no more food in the game, and you only gain gold from quests and battle loot. Other elements like natural disasters (floods, plagues, etc.), and all the laws and decrees are gone too. As a result the whole "kingdom management" aspect of the game is mostly gone and reduces the depth of the game.\n\nREVIEW\n\nKing Arthur makes a comeback, and the result is overall "good enough" by being neither great nor bad. The text adventures are still fun as ever, adding a wild card to the gameplay which puts you in a wide variety of situations, and gives a unique flavor to the story telling in this game.\n\nThe biggest change seems to be the simplification of many aspect of the game, which results in a clear loss of depth and replayability, but at the same time makes the game more accessible to casual players. The first King Arthur was a trinity of battle, management, and text adventures. King Arthur 2 is a duality of battle and text adventure only since the management aspect is mostly gone.\n\nEven if regrettable, this change isn't all bad. The campaign seemed to have more "flow" to it than in the previous game. You will find yourself passing the turns faster since you don't have to take as many decisions, the game is now more comparable to a relaxing read of a book than a struggle to expand your realm, fight the enemy, and deal with the random events and quest spawning frenzy. In other words, the kingdom management is gone but the game is now a more refined adventure game.\n\nUnfortunately some of the more serious technical shortcomings present in the first King Arthur are still present. The random crashes seem to be mostly gone; thankfully I only crashed a couple of times so far. But the extremely low performance and framerate problem is still here. I also found quite a few bugs, like having the narrator reading the wrong text for a quest, campaign map objects flickering, reserve units disappearing, and archer upgrades from buildings affecting their melee damage instead of ranged damage, etc. Also I encountered 2 game stopping bugs myself, and other players reported half a dozen game breaking bugs just days after release.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nYour experience with the game will vary wildly depending on the performance you get. If the game runs well, you will probably enjoy it as it is a very charming game, and even if it has lost some of its depth I feel the game gives enough entertainment value for its pricetag.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are getting bad to horrible performance, the game will be near unplayable and it might be a deal breaker for you. I highly recommend you try the demo to see how the game runs on your machine. The first KA still gets 12 FPS on my machines after 7 patches, so if history repeats itself as usual a quick fix to the performance problem is not going to happen. However it is worth mentioning that the Neocore team is active on the forums and seems to be working actively on fixing bugs.\n\nOf course if you consider yourself a fan of the series, you will probably want to buy the game and play it even with the bad performance and the buggy release. I know a number of people will do this, as I did myself since the game is somewhat playable for me (25fps) on minimal settings.\n\nSo the bottom line is:\n\n1) If you are a fan of the series you will want to buy it and be patient while bugs get fixed.\n2) If this is your first King Arthur game you might want to wait for a couple of patches or a sale.\n3) In all cases trying the demo first is highly recommended since the performance issue is probably a big, if not the biggest factor in your purchase decision.","November 28, 2013","false","40.4"," 107 of 126 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","107","126","0","5"

It takes place (as is obvious from the title) During the mythical time of king arthur and his knights of the round table. This aspect adds alot of fantasy elements into the game and is a nice change of pace from all the historical strategy games on the market today.\n\nThe story and narration in king arthur are very well done. Quests feel fun to do with multiple ways to complete many of them.The only let down with the questing is that it generally falls into 2 types of quests: text based and combat quests meaning you either have to read tons of text or go to a set area with your army and kill something,Thats all you really do.\n\nThe fantasy elements come at a high price: Basic human units feel weak and lackluster when compared to high fantasy golems, dragons and shape shifting warriors.Therefore by games end you will have replaced the majority of your army with fantasy units rather than human infantry and archers.\n\nThe addition of magic into the game adds more depth to the way you fight battles, But sadly magic in both King arthur games feels overpowered to the extreme.It is possible to win battles without ever firing a single arrow or engaging in hand-to-hand combat.The enemy AI in the game also has to capability to decimate your entire army with magic.\n\nLastly heroes in the game are capable of winning entire battles almost single handedly.As a result the rest of your army is reverted to a support role,Taking damage so your hero can close the range to engage with melee or magic attacks.\n\nAll these things mean that you will be forced to fill your armies with as many overpowered fantasy units as possible. Because you can rest assured that the Ai armies wiil be packed with them.\n\noverall unless you find this game on sale i would say avoid it.The game constantly nudges you in the way it wants you to play rather than allowing you free reign to go where you want and attack whoever you want.","June 13, 2014","false","86.9"," 40 of 51 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","40","51","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thanatov/recommended/24480/","Thanatov","Thanatov","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thanatov/","377 products in account","The best way to describe this game is how the title describes it, the role playing wargame, that essentially boils down to a Total War game with RPG elements.  Unfortunately the units and battles are not very balanced at all, there is no incentive to having cheaper units as there is no upkeep or economy, so there is no point in not just stacking your armies with the best most expensive units.   The rpg elements in the game are pretty good though.   You essentially start out by choosing a class which gives you a bonus to either leadership, magic, or combat and gives you different spells to learn.  You choose how to level up your character and units by choosing different spells and stats to upgrade.  You then go out and fight armies and complete "quests" to gain new items and bonuses.  Your decisions effect your morality (akin to Medieval 2 total war) moving from tyrant to rightful or christian to pagan ruler.

A turn based strategy map where you move your hero around completing quests but unlike Kings Bounty during fights it switches to a Total War real time combat with armies. Being a fan of both games, i definitely enjoyed King Arthur II.\n\nI loved leveling up the various hero units and equiping all manners of artifacts to them. Regular army units can be leveled up and customized in various ways as well. The amount of unit variety and their abilities also made experimenting with different units fairly enjoyable although you could stick with the same standard units and still steamroll the enemies. I also liked the magic shield and spell mechanics in battle. The 'choose your own adventure' RPG quests also allows you to reap different benefits/penalties depending on your choices which is also fun.\n\nHowever, i did find the game somewhat linear and short. Beyond the main quest plots  you really can't deviate that much. Sure you could make evil choices during the RPG portions and become a tryrant but the main quests still remain the same. Enemies or allies are fairly scripted and don't really do much of anything that could alter your strategy. And the controls can be a bit clunky. My biggest annoyance was with the holdings/fiefdoms management. I had to constantly click through many windows to upgrade the buildings and to figure out who was the liegelord of which holdings etc.\n\nOverall i enjoyed the game and i think that if you liked Kings Bounty, you would probably enjoy this game as well.","March 22, 2015","true","49.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

A sad story, and thats exactly what this game is a sad sad story.\n\nTo begin with the positives the gameplay is nice units get some pretty nice upgrades when they level up and you can use a lot of different army compositions in this game. The heroes (or generals) also have some really nice specialities the wizard for example is adept at killing big masses of enemies in a split second or changing the weather in order to stop contain certain types of units from dealing massive damage to his army, the champion is really good in being at the front lines hack and slashing your enemies and providing CC to help the whole of his army maneuver or flank your enemies and last the warlord is...what one would expect, a good old classic general buffing his army and providing support for units while also fighting in the front lines. The units are really interesting, there are a lot of different upgrades for your units to check out and all of them have their uses and you can customise your army in any way you want.\n\nSo thats all nice right? A rather nice game with interesting gameplay and storyline a few puzzles here and there etc etc. Well yes, untill you realise that some units are just broken some certain builds have by far the strongest units the wizard class is just hands down over powered and you can also bring more generals along if you so desire allowing you to decimate entire armies while keeping your spell shield so strong that the enemy wont be able to cast a single spell appart from a few supportive ones. The cavalry just crushes everything they find in their way with enough momentum and suprise suprise they have a skill that maxes it instantly, monsters are kind of useless (archers and spearmen make short work of them due to the extra damage spearmen have and the damage archers have the ability to rain down on them in combination with wizard heroes in your army monster are just big fat masses of flesh that die before they manage to reach your light infantry which they are expected to take care of), there is absolutely no reason to upgrade any of your castles since you will never fight in them even if the enemy attacks you while you are defending them, you can not create more armies than what the game gives you, for example you get pendragon morgana and lancelot. THE END no more armies even though the game gives you somewhat about 12 more heroes. The strategic map has no value any negotiations with other kingdoms are 100% worthless and overall all there is to do is the quests... Thats it, you do the main quest choices do not matter appart from the ones that give you points towards you religious believes and wether you are considered a tyrant or not and thats it, anything else is compeletely pointless and if you want to do it you do it just for your own personal reasons like roleplay etc. they provide you with almost nothing appart from different looking units and thats it...\n\nOver all this game could potentially be a great one it really is a shame because I wanted to see this game becoming great the ideas in it are really nice and fresh, it's just a shame that the developers stopped supporting the game...Lets hope creative assembly makes a good job with their warhammer title.","May 2","false","16.2"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","0"

I can't say since I haven't played them before, but I have played the first King Arthur. This game plays similarly to the first game with a few exceptions. The developpers have tried to make a few balance changes from things that generally seem overpowered in the first game; namely magic, cavalry, and archers. There's now a magic shield that helps prevent your units from getting completely mashed before they even make contact with the other team, along with cast times for most spells. Cavalry now actually gets mashed by spearmen instead of the other way around, but they still pretty much trample everything else. Archers have a much lower starting accuracy, and you can't get skills to prevent decrease in shooting distance to take advantage of combinations such as Storm of Avalon to counter cavalry. Of course, by the end of the campaign, all of these points are moot anyway because units level up to 15 and destroy pretty much everything regardless.\n\nThe campaign has an interesting story, but runs into the same issues of the first game after a while. Namely that auto-batlle becomes an extremely appealing option regardless if it causes more casualties to prevent the tedium of fighting the same battle over and over again. This is especially an issue since you can only have 3 armies by the end of the campaign, thus giving you little room to vary your tactics.\n\nAll in all, it's a fun game, especially for the price during sales. I enjoyed the story and the puzzles in the campaign, but should probably have stretched out the game a bit more so battles didn't become a chore.","April 17","true","28.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

A ton of new choices, epic new fights and an improvement in literally every aspect of the game save two.\n\nThe first one is building.\n\nIn the first one, you got one city where you would build all your upgrades. In this game, you have multiple "villages" or "forges" scattered around everywhere. An enemy can walk over one and grab it easily because you can only have up to three armies and that's at the very end of the game. Nothing is centralized and it just makes you do a lot of extra button clicks to do the same thing.\n\nThe second part is story:\n\nThe Story is VERY forcefully linear. You can't attack or use diplomacy with neighbors until you enter a certain part of the story and by that time. Your own empire is so huge they are almost no consequence. You don't have a single challenge outside of one fight which is just stupid because of the restrictions they added to it.\n\nIf you like that building style and story method.

Never mind. Also may not be the best game for the  seriously paranoid as your magic seems pretty damned feeble  but what the AI is zapping you with is whamo straight off the main  grid.Music fine, voice acting ok,role play seems to be choose between ending up a really nice guy or a complete card carrying  prat and the only bug I have encountered so far is that start and end the game will lock up  promptly if you don't move your mouse.Other than that this is lots of pretty good wargamery for not much cash with the current deal.

The game doesn't have the same feeling to it as the original tho: units have sort of "tiers" where the crappy ones deal ~50 dmg and the best ones ~400 so the army progression feels kind of forced. In the first game you faced giants with human spearmen, in this one you run around with magical ubersoldiers (or die). The game also lacks the whole economy aspect of the first title, so enlarging your empire feels meh. Performance in combat is suboptimal most of the time, even tho it doesn't make me want to die. If you like RPG elements, and running around a huge map with a personal army, you might enjoy this game.

RPG and wargame...  It tries to be similar to the Total War franchise in regards to its combat.  Unfortunately, a number of the units are unbalanced, and so the combat can take a lot longer than it should.  It adds spells, which I found to be an annoyance, as my archers were always literal lightning rods.\nThe overarching strategy seemed deficient as well, as there aren't many ways to get gold so tech, infrastructure and army all suffer.  It also limits the number of armies that you can have roaming around, so wandering armies just take over buildings of mine, which admittedly didn't seem to affect me at all.\nAs far as the RPG factor goes, it again struggles.  For some reason the player is fighting Irish demons.  You don't get to see or use King Arthur, and end up killing multiple knights of the round table.  Other knights don't even appear, which would be understandable for most, but they cut out Gawain, and left in Agravain?  A lot of the leveling really didn't feel like it mattered for heroes.\nOverall, depending on what you want there are games which do what this game does, only much better.  I can't recommend this game.","April 2","false","14.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

AWESOME and KA 2 take places after those events. and you fight the Emperor !\n\nstorie- is AWESOME, now every quest is voiced, and you as a protagonist have to work with morgana le fay and lancelot to restore the kingdom.

Character and Unit designs are amazing, even if they do recycle some models with a different skin or effect. All in all, however the game is very good, even if it doesn't break new ground. I'd give it a 7.5/10","April 8, 2014","true","23.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Gain spells and abilities that are great and fun to use.\n\nNo bugs that i have found.\n\nCons\n\nbattles are a bit plain, like total war but not as good by alot\n\nno free mode, just one single story\n\nBut over all game is worth £1.50 by far, i would pay £10 for it easy\n\n7.5/10","October 6, 2015","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I forced myself to play through this game once when I first got it and just recently returned to try it again. The biggest problem with the game is that you cant auto battle fights. Some fights you can and some you cant. It is the fights you cant auto battle that kill the fun of the game. I used to like war games where you control the soldiers in battle until the games all became exorcises in graphics masturbation. I dont need to see the leaves on the trees or the expression on the individual soldiers faces. It slows the game and clogs up my screen. I just dont care about graphics. A lot of games make allowance for multiple types of gamers some of whom love graphics and some who dont. This game seems to feel that if they wasted their time making a pretty tree you will by god look at the pretty tree! I just cant make myself struggle through slow annoying crap to try a different roleplay option. It just doesn't have the replay value I want in a game for me to recommend it.","March 28","false","30.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
