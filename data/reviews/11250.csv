This game has more unique aspects and additions to what is losely a grand strategy RTS then any game i can think of. It's a dated game, very dated...but it's a risk sized grand strategy map, where you deal with battles on a RTS scale, with very realistic combat, nice graphics and the ability to take personal control of the units. This makes it sort of a grand strategy/RTS/Plane&ShipSim all in one. Seriously...why the hell did i not know about this game earlier?","August 22, 2012","true",""," 143 of 160 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","143","160","6","0"

It brings me back to PTO II on the NES system.  It can be a little overwhelming for beginners, but once you immerse yourself in the challenge, you won't be able to turn it off.  Grab some redbulls and enjoy.","November 8, 2015","true","0.3"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

If you are comfortable with the interface of Theatre of War then you will be fine with this game, otherwise just buy Battlestations: Midway/Pacific.","April 28, 2015","false","1.8"," 8 of 27 people (30%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","30","8","27","4","0"

Rest assured, I gave it its second, third, and fourth chances. I can safely say that this game is a piece. Of. ♥♥♥♥.\n\nBuy this only if you want to hear the words "FIYYUUH" over and over and over and over and over again.","April 6, 2013","false",""," 39 of 153 people (25%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","25","39","153","10","0"
