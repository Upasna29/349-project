A lot were bad however there was a lot of positive as well so I took a chance because I loved Disciples 2 so much.  Well let me be another that is in the bad review camp.\nI also read that D3-Resurrection was the game that should of been released in the first place.  They said they fixed most of the bugs.  If that is true then I would hate to play the hot mess that was before this one because there is still tons of bugs.   Some of those same reviews said how beautiful the graphics were, are they playing the same game as me?  Your move points are very low, so just going to get that gold pile that is about 5 inches away takes two turns. Its also really hard to logically see where you can move on the map without triggering combat.   Sometimes during combat there is no walking animation, the units just glide as they move.  Most of the time when an archer fires the terrain will block the camera view. Really cheesy!   The combat is slow, repetitive and boring.  The only real tactical dission is what unit to attack.  Then it boils down to just exchanging blows and hope you can win.\nI dont recommend Disciples III.  If interested get Disciples 2 as that is the game the fans fell in love with.\n","January 20, 2014","false","4.9"," 46 of 59 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","46","59","0","0"

At that point, i entered my key and managed to play a few hours. Those hours were not incredibly fun. The strategy would boil down in having werewolves as soon as possible because all the melee creatures were unable to touch them making most fights trivial.\nThe features they had changed from renaissance didnt look like good ideas balance wise so i ended up quitting the game. Fast forward 5 months and i suddenly cannot login the game anymore because it decided that my online key isn't valid. Nothing has changed in my setup. Since the game wasn't super fun last time around, i gave up. Couldn't recommend the game to anyone because of both the balance issues and the key issues on their server.","April 16, 2014","false","2.5"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","26","32","0","0"

I think the game was made a little dummer this time but the graphics are better. Story line will put you to sleep. Every map features a lot of objectives. Huge maps to explore. more advanced combat from the one we saw in disciples 2. Here both parties actually can move around during fight which is both good and bad. If a melee unit gets close to your ranged unit it will take heavy damage. If you take out enemy unit that has healing properties you will gain advantage.","June 24, 2014","true","26.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It adds a new faction and a new campagin but the leveling system is so slow you need to go though half the map before they level once... which means a lot of time spent running back and forth healing your troops.

The developers apparently thought that all you need to do is leave everything as it was in the previous games. The reality proved them wrong. The result is a bug-riddled game where gameplay is not fun (stupid AI) and full of unbalanced creatures. Okay, the game looks beautiful and is full of the series folklore, but nowadays graphics is not enough for a decent game. There is much unused potential in the title. But I don't recommend it in the current state. I hope they change the dev team and truly ressurect the title.","January 31, 2015","false","48.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There are two different types of magic, one for use in the battle arenas, and one for use whilst travelling across the world map, and if you don't have your wits about you, neither will make sense.  Apart from that the game unfolds nicely (play the main release first, as this is the expansion, even though it plays without the original) and has an involving, if very complicated, storyline.\n\nWatch out for crashes and other curruptions even in the updated version.  Always save before going to battle or visiting shops as these tend to create crash points.\n\nThey've made changes to the combat system in this exapnsion, and personally I don't think they're for the better.  Certain character types (mellee in particulart) now have two slots per battle round, rather than just one, and reinsert themselves high up the turn table when their first turn has been used.  This may have been done to balance the difficulty that mellee types normally missed their first round attack as they couldn't cover enough arena squares to reach an enemy.  However, mellee types have always had the extra advantage of delivering much more damage than a ranged attack, so this change really wasn't necessary.  It actually becomes confusing.  That, coupled with a revised "cover shot" system, whereby you get locked into covering yourself, not just other characters under your control, means the balance of arena battles has been seriouslly jarred and takes a while to figure things out.  You can also trap oppsition units into self-cover, so perhasps there is a small up side to this.  Like a lot of games, once you'be worked out the system you can play it to your advantage, but it's a tricky system and misjudgements are usually fatal.\n\nOn the plus side, Lambert has been brought back from what we thought was the dead,,,,","December 31, 2014","true","45.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
