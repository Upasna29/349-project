It pretty much plays like a NES game, though the graphics and music are *slightly* more modern. It’s hard, but not too hard. It gets easier if you keep practicing, and is very rewarding when you manage to finish a level. There’s also tons of references to NES games, which you’ll probably know from AVGN’s videos, and the music is awesome too.\n\nMy only complaint is that it seems to crash quite a lot, especially when I’m near the end of a level.

After a brief tutorial level to kickoff the game, it opens up to eight selectable levels. A few are far easier than others. There is a lot of parody going on here. Levels reminiscent of old Nintendo games like Castlevania, Metroid, Super Mario Bros 2 and Zelda 2. You'll even find an 8 bit parody of dirty Atari games. Once you complete those eight, then the final LJN style level gets revealed. It is all based on the comedy from the Angry Video Game Nerd web series that has been around for a decade. Its a good game that doesn't offer any unique features that aren't found in other Nintendo games. If you're looking for something fresh and original gameplay wise, you won't find it here.\n\nThe game plays a lot like Mega Man. Jump, shoot (with no autofire), duck and use a special item. The only difference is there is 8 way shooting like Contra. You can even hold the trigger to plant your feet so you don't walk as you aim diagonal. The items are few and far between. The tutorial level will walk you through all them. Glitch gremlin that I think kills everything killable on screen? Seven hours into the game and I still don't know for sure. Super Mecha Death Christ definitely kills everything on screen. Things like a rock that do little to no damage. Its just in the game so the Nerd can make a joke. The Nerd can even pick up a superscope weapon that does more damage, but one hit and you've lost it. A lot of times you'll find it in areas with unkillable enemies.\n\nEven as a torture platformer, the game isn't that difficult. Timing is key. More than missing a jump, its missing a jump at the wrong time might get you hit and you'll fall in a pit. Each level is around 10 minutes. You have health measured in beer. Pick up a beer to restore your health. On easy you can walk into enemies with no regard for your life. Normal difficulty and up you have to have skills to not die from health loss. Each enemy causes you to get knocked back which becomes deadly if a pit is around. With that being said, the majority of deaths come from death blocks. Mega Man 2 had spikes, AVGN has deathblocks. These are everywhere! Some are in the ground. Somme are moving. Some are on and off with a timer. Some appear only when you get close to them. If you're not paying attention, to where you step, you're dead!\n\nNin-Toasters get used as checkpoints. These are pretty frequent. When you die, you respawn, but not after seeing a death screen with a randomly generated death phrase that usually involves an animal, a fluid and an body hole. You cannot turn off these death screens. It could be to hide a loading screen. You need to see it for a few seconds before pushing jump to get back to the action. Most torture platformers just drop you right back into the action.\n\nEach level is pretty straight forward, but still allows for exploration here and there. You'll even find three extra characters to play as. Each has their own style and can be toggled on the fly with the shoulder bumpers. Mike has a high Luigi jump and can use a short range light sabre to break through walls that get highlighted as you draw near. He also makes invisible platforms appear. Couch Guy has a wave attack from his guitar that will go through blocks when the Nerd's gun can't. His jump is short, so he's better for SHMUP sections of the game. Finally '♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥' has a double jump and a short range arced attack, but can't jump as high as the Nerd. He's good for accessing different areas. For the most part, these extra characters are only used for finding secret areas, that have cameos from other ScrewAttack friends along with plenty of beer and 1-ups.\n\nThe enemies feel diverse, but there isn't a huge variety. Each level swaps out enemy sprites. High bouncing enemies, enemies that attract to you, wave pattern enemies, floor spikes that shoot up, hovering enemies, circular flying unkillable fireballs and so on. Each level has its own unique big enemies. Snowmen that belch giant snowballs. Giant turd balls that spit dookie at you in Hell. Axe throwers in the Castlevania level. Each enemy's death had particle effects that felt satisfying. At the end of each level is of course a boss, straight from AVGN's history of evil. Jason Vorhees, Satan, Dr. Jekyll / Mister Hyde, General Custer and so on. Most of the bosses just fly in a figure eight pattern.\n\nUnlike most torture platformers, there was dynamic gameplay. Going from a platformer to a sidescrolling SHMUP. Riding down a hill one a dead corpse, streaking blood behind you. Hopping on a giant laser shark and tearing through lava. These were all a lot of fun to break up the levels. Even with each level having its own theme, there were things gimmick wise to make them stand out. The Castlevania level has a series of timed on and off death blocks. The dirty Atari level has bouncing platforms under your feet. The snow level had ice to slide on. The Zelda 2 level had keys to unlock doors. The haunted level has moving block platforms like Super Mario World and darkness outside of a short illumination around the Nerd. The Mega Man future level had timed laser beams and timed on / off platforms. It was able to keep the challenges dynamic.\n\nIt is no doubt a good game for fans that like Mega Man's gameplay. There are just little things that get in the way. The text box at the bottom of the screen with the Nerd talking is a distraction and obscures the action. In fact, the entire game is just a distraction. There are laser lights panning through some levels. Things flying everywhere. Even a vomit inducing waterfall ala Super Mario Bros 2. Half a dozen fireballs flying in a circle, bouncing on platforms, while enemies float toward you! Its all very busy, but that's probably to keep your eyes off the death blocks! The comedy also misses its mark, but I feel a lot of comedy games aren't that funny. Maybe its lacking the Nerd's delivery. Its just not as funny in text form when I'm too busy playing the game to read it.\n\nPlaying normal mode first took 2 hours for the first 8 levels and 4 hours for the final level. I sank around 100 lives just for the final boss. Then I discovered how to plant my feet by holding the trigger to shoot diagonal without walking. Normal difficulty gives you unlimited continues and 30 lives. I felt the intensity when I had died 10 times on a boss and I was coming to my final life to beat him. Easy difficulty gives you more health and unlimited lives ensuring you'll get through the game. There are higher difficulties, but normal was enough for me. I have a feeling you can complete easy difficulty in under 2 hours.\n\nTo summarize, its the best AVGN game you could hope for. Easy difficulty makes it so everyone can complete the game. If it wasn't for easy difficulty I wouldn't recommend it. I'd recommend it more for fans of old Nintendo games than AVGN fans. If you're into 8-bit Nintendo games, especially Mega Man. Get it. Also take note that 50% of players have the 100 deaths achievement. So does that mean on easy mode they beat it in under 100 lives or did they just give up and not complete it?","December 12, 2014","true","8.1"," 50 of 56 people (89%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","89","50","56","8","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/recommended/237740/","ashdot","Callietrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/","1456 products in account","One of the most frustrating, yet fun to play platformers I've ever had the pleasure of playing. A game based on the hit, internet sensation the Angry Video Game Nerd, a character portrayed by James Rolfe whom reviews older games ranging from the Atari, to the SEGA Genesis to the NES and a bunch more.\n\nOff the bat, the game starts out by introducing the Angry Video Game Nerd (or AVGN for short) before he is sucked into the TV (by the balls no less!) and is forced to play through what he calls hell. The stages, quotes, etc are references to older video games and episodes he has done in the past. The game itself conveys a traditional 8-Bit art style for the majority of assets used in the game aswell as play the expected 8-bit style music to go along with them.\n\nNow, personally, I love this game and actively recommend it to everyone that loves/loved watching AVGN and likes tough platformers in general. The game plays out very similarly to classic MegaMan games and Mario Bros, since the Nerd has his standard jump, shoot and crouch, as well as a few nifty temporary power-ups you can pick up across the stages - these range from the Glitch Gremlin (a green creature that glitches the game and often helps with progression as it halts both stage hazards and enemies), the Super Mega Death Christ (Yes lol, a power up that destroys every enemy present on the screen at the time.), an upgraded gun for the Nerd (Has a much bigger hitbox than his standard light gun) and rocks (Yes rocks, like those found on one of his older episodes that he says is useless because of the low travel distance and low damage).\n\nThe game has a 3 damage health system and lives (unless you pick a higher or lower difficulty setting in which the game alters these). 3 beer bottles pretty much signal how many more hits you can take before dying, and the lives, like in older Megaman games, means how many times you can retry before being kicked out from the stages. There are also toasters (checkpoints) scattered across the stage to mark your progress on any given stage, but they are optional to activate as there are also beer bottles scattered across to help restore health to you - and there's also secret characters you can unlock all based on his show.\n\nStage Progression~ Generally, excluding the tutorial stage - you pick a stage in a similar fashion to MegaMan games, there are 8 in total. Each stage has their own deathtraps, some will take a point of damage, and some, like the golden skull blocks found across every stage, will kill you in one hit. Some zones are based around very careful and timing based jumps, movement, etc - like some zones will have an enemy type that is there to hinder you while you do a section, it's all very much reminiscent of the old formula of games back in the day - and like those games, this game isn't very forgiving.\n\nIn general, if you're a fan of the AVGN no doubt you'll already have this, but if you're a fan of tough NES-like platformers, get this game. From the obscenely ridiculous references to the appealing art style, this game screams AVGN charm.\n\nB+","November 26, 2013","true","3.0"," 78 of 108 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","78","108","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/recommended/237740/","infindima","A. Yeager","http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/","680 products in account","I'm a huge fan of AVGN and have watch every single one of his videos several times. To see a game based on his outrages is such a brilliant idea. This game really takes everything that he hates about bad games, or they take some of his comments and make them an actual idea. (Especially the "Super Pitfall" reference was brilliant.)\n\nIf you've watched his videos you'll easily catch the references through out the game and the appearences of popular characters. Some of them are so awesome it brought a huge smile to my face (like the fireshark) and it's also nice being able to beat up the boss on the Atari stage. They are in no way overpowering a whole stage, just a small reference placed perfect in some parts of the game.\n\nI liked that the stages had their own themes as well as that they tried to include his famous quotes in the game as a reference. I wouldn't have mind seeing more bats in the horror stage, as it always seems the old games have way too many bats than needed. I think my favorite stage was the Winter stage, just because of what happens after you defeat the first boss. Just brilliant and easily my favorite part of the game. Anytime you die, you get a randomly generated outrage from the nerd which is fun when there's a great mix up.\n\nThe graphics are well done and the music is very good. The controls for the most part feels very solid. I'm glad you can adjust the keyboard to your own liking.\n\nSo why don't I recommend this game?\n\nWell, unfortunately whoever designed all these stages obviously ran out of ideas after taking the nerds outrages that don't fill a complete stage. So half the stages consist of instant death blocks. More than half of the deaths within the game will happen due to these blocks that are everywhere. Placed in hard-to-reach areas, walls of death blocks that changes between invisibility and jumping over them with a sketchy trampoline techinques. Did I mention they are literally everywhere in this game?\n\nWhat would have been a brilliant platformer with great humor and references, ends up being a practice jump game to test your accuracy whether or not you're able to avoid these deathblocks or not. I guess the idea is making the game so utterly frustrating you will swear and scream like the Nerd, but even the games he played seem more fun than going through a stage of deathblocks. A lot of the games he did play featured some areas with frustrating jumps, but not to the extend that this game uses them.\n\nIf it wasn't for these tedious deathblocks, the game would honestly be very short. There isn't much variety to the stages other than being lucky enough to avoid deathblocks and occassionally shooting some enemies. It's like switching from one deathblock avoiding game to another. Just add some new sprites and backgrounds and voila, you are ready to make another test of frustrating accuracy. It feels quite sad that such a fantastic idea just ends up as a bland jumping game.\n\nI can enjoy a game despite them being difficult. This isn't one of them though. Anytime I completed a stage I didn't get that rewarding feeling. In other difficult games, you complete the difficult part, then move onto another different, yet difficult task. It really was like playing the same stages over and over, with the deathblocks making up too much of my playtime than it was enjoyable. I enjoyed the parts of the game where these weren't present and quite frankly, I wouldn't have minded them being a bit here and there. It just feels that they are all over the game as a way to extend a very short game into something longer.","December 15, 2013","false","4.5"," 178 of 287 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","178","287","0","9"

It does a great job of emulating the Nerd's typical brand of crude, geeky humour. The game is all about what the show is about: raging at old-school, hardcore gameplay that is often frustratingly hard.\n\nIt plays just like a classic Nintendo platformer, with levels poking fun at famous - as well as infamous - games of the 80's and 90's. What is great is that it throws these old-school frustrations at you without it being badly designed. It's done in such a way that it is hard not because it's poorly designed, like many of the Nerd's most despised games, but because it requires skill and some effort. It's not unfair if you start at the easiest settings.\n\nThe Nerd humour is recognizable in every element of the game: there's a randomly generated line of cursewords if you die, Mecha Jesus powerups, a laser-shooting shark in Hell, snowboarding on Santa's corpse, sh*t pickles and gratitious amounts of potty humour. Each level is distinct and full of geeky references to the show.\n\nIn the style of Capcom classics like Mega Man or DuckTales, you can start at any level you want, with an additional final level opening up once you beat all of them. Each one is based on different Nerd episodes and video games. At one point you are fighting Doom-inspired poop demons and a big-toothed Satan in Hell, the next moment you play through a colourful level reminiscent of Super Mario World and in another instance you find yourself shooting ghosts and zombies in a Castlevania-based world. There's even a level based on the 'Atari Porn Games' episode which really must be seen to be believed.\n\nHidden inside the game are three additional playable characters from the Cinemassacre.com universe as well as cameos of Screwattack.com stars. Fans of the Nerd will know what I am talking about. Power-ups include Super Mecha Death Christ and the Glitch Gremlin, two funny allies that attack all enemies on screen. There's also somewhat useless grenades, poking fun at that one useless power-up that every video game in the 80s and 90s seemed to have.\n\nIt's that parody element that makes this game so great. It's not just an old-school 'NES-hard' game, it's also a parody of every game ever made in that genre, both the classics and the ones that are the subjects of the Nerd's crudely graphic tirades. If you like that type of humour and are a fan of the show, this game is for you. If you are unfamiliar with the AVGN and the show's inside jokes, the game falls a bit short, however. Look past the Nerd twist given to classic gaming tropes and the levels turn out to be fairly similar in gameplay elements and are only different enough in the visual department.\n\nIf you like old-school, NES-hard platformers, you will feel right at home. You will die. A lot! At the easiest setting, you have unlimited lives, plenty of checkpoints and more health. The credits will roll in a few hours. Try normal, hard or one of the unlockable even harder (!) modes and you will face a much more meaty challenge that will leave even the most veteran gamer screaming in frustration.\n\nThere are plenty of similar old-school platform games available on Steam. Wether or not you want to buy this particular one ultimately boils down to the question of wether or not you are a fan of the Nerd. If you are, it's worth your ten bucks. If you aren't, it's just one of many games to choose from for fans of this genre. You won't get much of the inside jokes that make up much of what sets this game apart from others. Thankfully, the overlap between genre fans and the AVGN fandom is probably big enough to make this a game I can recommend.","April 7, 2015","true","3.7"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","23","26","2","0"

The game itself as a potential concept that brings me to say that the platformer element is there at any moment,\nSometimes unfair, sometimes really funny and addicting.\n\n2. Good, ♥♥♥♥ing, 8-Bit SOUNDTRACK.\n\n3. The ambientation is awesome, colorful and good looking.\n\n4. You can finish the game in one sit, so no problem if you are an hardcore player.\n\n5. Is worth all your money.\n\nThe BAD Things\n1. Blocks and traps. I'm sure that everyone is going to say that a platformer needs to have blocks and traps everywhere, but lemme say, that having a block is a thing, having a block that you can see only if you are near to it, is a ♥♥♥♥ING SUICIDE.\n\n2. Well, It's, short. Too much short for a game that values 10 euros, no offense.\n\n3. This is not too much of a bad thing, but prepare to ♥♥♥♥ing swear your balls off, because this game is HARD even on easy.\n\nFinal vote? Well, i don't like to give a rating to the games i play but whatever, let me do it.\nI'm giving\n\n8.5/10 to this game.\n\nAvoiding all the flaws, i'm sorry to give such a low raiting, the game itself is a LOT enjoyable, and you are going to have so much fun, but when you are near to the end, you can see that they run out of time and ideas. They made an entire map full of blocks that appears only if you are near of it, and that's unfair, pretty damn unfair.\n\nThe game itself is GOOD really GOOD!\nSo buy bud, grab some goodies and have fun.\n\nThanks for reading, Laguna's off.","June 12, 2015","true","13.9"," 31 of 43 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","31","43","2","2"

We play as the angry game nerd who gets trapped in Game Land. So he has to conquer all the levels to get out. So how is this game ? Personally i really enjoyed it. This game is a shooter platformer in the style of contra. The game also is quite difficult and one of the hardest games i have played. The game has a few problems. The level desing is pretty bad. The controls are kinda stiff at moments cause the game requires a split second reaction time. The game is also quite buggy.The game has this really annoying thing called Death Blocks which seems like all levels are made. If you touch em thats it game over and its quite annoying that youre jumps need to be very persise to not get killed by em. Overall Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures is a really fun platforming game with an exceptional soundtrack and its also really fun to play. Its also quite short and i suggest you get this game on sale.

Noob (Nightmare Lyra)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightmarelyre/","406 products in account","Before people get angry, yes I like AVGN, I like challenging platformers, I like chiptune music and 8-bit grapichs, etc. and I really really wanted to like this game.\n\nHowever, I am also of the opinion that if you are parodying something by doing the same thing ironically and then charging money for it, you are still doing the same thing as the thing you parody, and there lies the real problem: strip away the funny presentation and this is the very type of game that James Rolfe makes fun of in his videos, a game filled with fake difficulty to artificially pad out the play time.\n\nYes, I get it, it's meta jokes, and the jokes are fun... the first time, then comes the major grind to actually beat the levels with insane unfair difficulty. The levels are fairly well designed in of themselves and are amusingly parodying many of the games reviewed on the show, but the platforming controls are rather stiff, hitboxes are often bigger/smaller than they look and obviously the game does everything to kill you as much as possible, though not in a funny "invisible block near a pit" kind of way which would give it a bit of a puzzle element, here it's just by throwing a lot of ♥♥♥♥ at you at once and having you deal with it through sheer pressure.\n\nAlso while other fake difficulty parody games like I Wanna Be That Guy at least have the decensy to not throw you back to the beginning unless you pick the higher difficulties when you die, here it does just that on everything but Easy when running out of extra lives which I find to be a major flaw from a modern perspective, no matter how retro or thematically appropriate it is. And before you say "just go play on Easy then", I would if it didn't give me more HP than normal, make bosses stupidly easy to beat and lock off several achivements, which obviously isn't very enjoyable, and it still doesn't fix the hitbox and stiff controller issue.\n\nIgnoring the difficulty, the game is also rather short. If you get good at this I could imagine you would be able to beat the entire thing in 2-3 hours, though it does have a fair ammount of hidden secrets and replay value for the really really hardcore crowd when you unlock the truly ridicolous difficulty levels, so it's not that big of a problem, but still worth noting.\n\nBasically, if you don't mind NES games that beat your ♥♥♥ with fake difficulty to the max and aren't affraid to start from the beginning of a stage (or the game itself) every time you die, you will probably love this game. Fans of AVGN may also appreciate the referencial humor to both the show itself and the games that he have played. However, the game still isn't up to modern standards in many respects, and it is rather hypocritical, and therefor I cannot recommend it to everyone. It's basically an extremely niche title with a (relatively) mass appeal brand attached to it, but if you don't fall into that niche it might not be worth the frustration no matter how much you like AVGN. If Steam had a "middle" option I would have picked that, but for now I am sad to say I will have to give it a thumbs down personally.\n\nAlso, I think James did a disadvantage to the game by reviewing it himself and showing off all the best bits in the video, made playing the actual thing feel a bit less special.","June 26, 2014","false","1.3"," 55 of 95 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","55","95","0","4"

Unfortunately, AVGN Adventures falls into this category. The level design is lazy and uninspired. The enemies and bosses are boring and game relies much too heavily on instant kill blocks everywhere for difficulty in place of clever level design. I haven't seen that many AVGN videos, so I'm sure I missed out on some inside jokes, but if there are half as many poop jokes there as in this game, I'm pretty sure I'm not missing out. Overall, the game isn't terrible.

While it certainly is good for AVGN fans and it certainly is difficult, it is by no means fair. Rather than building the game around a particular structure and then making that difficult, the game is built around the difficulty itself. This means that almost every part of the game is designed to kill you, particularly in certain areas. Fantastic music and stylized graphics are overshadowed by areas that get so difficult, they no longer feel like levels but like a path of obstacles created in a predesigned level builder. Many of the faults that the AVGN has pointed out in numerous bad games have been built into this one, and by doing so it's less of a parody and more of a bad game itself. All in all, AVGN fans will be pleased by the pretty colors and references, but anyone else will find this a very frustrating experience.","November 27, 2013","false","9.0"," 31 of 54 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","31","54","0","0"

I like to see this game kinda similar to Mega Man or Alien Hominid. Actually, Alien Hominid is similar to Mega Man except the controls are better and you even get to charge up your attack. But high five to the creator and his sense of humor. When you die, there's a complaint generator but most of them are too weird or sexual and doesn't sound like something AVGN would really say, or at least the younger AVGN wouldn't say.

There's potential here with decent controls and above average spritework but it is quickly squandered in gameplay aside from the outstanding soundtrack and occasional fun reprieve. There's a heavy reliance on 1-hit kill tiles and trollish blind traps to create a crutch of artificial difficulty that takes the place of interesting and iterative level design. Enemies, jokes and references get recycled over and over through the game to the point of tedium. As a fan of AVGN and very difficult platformers I was very disappointed but played through to the end to see if it got any better, it did not.","January 6","false","4.9"," 41 of 75 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","41","75","3","0"

The Angry Video Game Nerd. For people who's don't know him he basically reviews ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games from the NES, SNES, N64, or any game that is from the 80's/90's/or early 2000's games.\n\nThe Story\nNow Usually I go into depth in to the game's story but unfortunately I can't as unless you know who AVGN is from the start of playing this game then unfortunately you want get any sort of story or context of this game.\nBut really even going into depth about some sort of story there really isn't much of a story but more of references to some sort of character from the Angry Video Game Nerd Universe in each level as a boss. Not only this but the level design is purposely designed to be what AVGN has been complaining about in most games. For example\n\n- things that kill you in one hit or mistake\n- Ice Stages\n- Weird/ Hard stage Design\n- And so much more.\n\nSo I Highley Recommend you watch the AVGN on Youtube before playing.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/JamesNintendoNerd\n\nGameplay\nAs you can tell from the game's trailer, the game is a horizontal 2-D side scroler which is a great feel for his type of game. The controls feel great with a controller, with a keyboard it feel weird more than anything.\nThe Level design is hard but this is genius as this can make us fell like how AVGN would feel for every horrible game he has ever played. It's that good that every time you die that you get a quote from AVGN that would also show how you would feel. Or at the very least make you laugh. And when you die. The death screen joke from the Friday the 13th NES Review is in this.\n\nOverallThe game is really intended for the common AVGN fan, and is once again highly recommended you watch the AVGN Series before playing. It's one cool, Hard, Unfair yet funny experience.","March 13","true","4.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Don't bother with the movie it sucks bad. This game is decent I guess. Most of its fun is weighed on heavily by its absurd difficulty. If you don't have oldschool platformer skills then don't bother with this. It is fun to watch the AVGN rip apart old games that were "NES hard" but it is not that fun to play them. I want to watch him play it so I don't have to and say funny things about them, I don't really want to play a game as stressful and hard as this one. In the end, it is maddeningly difficult trial and error on the hardest two stages that I saved for last since they were in that order despite being able to choose any stage: Beat it and Eat it, and BOO Haunted House. Games back in the "NES hard" days were so hard because the devs programming was extremely limited by the hardware, forced to make short games but make them super hard to seem like they had more content in which they did not. If that's not the case then I don't know what is, because I can't imagine that more than 1% of kids back in the NES days could even come close to beating games like TMNT and Battletoads. This game is just like those: enemies that show up at precise times to give you nearly unavoidable hits and knock you into death traps, back to back jumps that require split second timing, followed by more back to back timed jumps, further complicated with rotating objects near them that make platforming a nightmare. Then comes the biggest problem of all that they fixed with the second game: death blocks. They really take away from this game's fun big time. If you anger easily, for God's sake don't buy this game.\n\nSo if you are 30 and over and pine for the old days like James and his friends do, then this is your game. I am 34 and I grew up in the NES era and I hated how hard the games were back then and I still do, because of how they were programmed on old extremely limiting primitive hardware like the NES. I like difficult games nowadays because the hardware and control methods are far advanced light years past the old days. Or at least designed much more intelligently to give you a more fair challenge.\n\n6.5/10 stress/rage inducing, but some fun is to be had.","March 31","true","3.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cosmozerk/recommended/237740/","Cosmozerk","Cosmozerk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cosmozerk/","6 products in account","After finally completing The Angry Video Game Adventures for the first time i can only say...WOW.\n\nSTORY: The plot of AVGN Adventures goes like this: One day the Nerd and his friends were playing a ***** game, when suddenly the TV sucks them in, the nerd tries to escape, but he gets grabbed by the sack and he enters Game Land to complete 9 levels and find out who the **** is responsible for this.\n\nPRESENTATION: AVGN Adventures, like many other games, looks like an old retro-NES-SNES-game and by that i mean that the game has a mixture between 8 and 16 bits type graphics and sound (all tho you could argue with 32 bits for the sound, but that's besides the point). The sprites and backgrounds are well done and detailed, the framerate is consistent (at around 60fps) and the music ¡is kick-***!, everything in this game looks colorful, eye catching and different from one and other.\n\nGAMEPLAY: AVGN Adventures plays like a 2D platforming shooter from the NES era with a very high difficulty. You platform around and shoot the enemies with the NES Zapper to progress and you can get upgrades or sub-weapons to add to your arsenal.\n\nThe game has 4 Characters to play with and each of them has some especial attribute, tho you do have to find the other characters. First there's "The Nerd", which is my personal favorite, he's the most balanced character of them all with a decent run speed, a decent jump high and he does decent damage, BUT! he is the only character who can use the upgrades and sub-weapons + he can stand in place and shoot in 8 directions, he is personally my character of choice most of the time. Then there's the "The Guitar Guy", he might seem like an awful character at first since he cannot use any sub-weapon or upgrade, he can only fire straight forward and he's jump is very...meh, BUT! he is the fastest of the bunch and his proyectiles can go through walls, proyectiles and barriers and believe me that doesn't sound like much, but he is very useful later on, especially on the final boss. Next there's "************ Mike", he has decent run speed and his weapon has a little range, BUT! he can use that weapon to destroy certain walls and he can jump the highest. And then theres "********-Man", he is the slowest of the bunch and he's jump is TERRIBLE, BUT he's the strongest and he can do a "not-so-helpful-double-jump", personally i never used him, and i feel he's the worst of all the characters. You find these hidden characters (excluding the Nerd) by using the abilities that each of them have.\n\nNow while the game does have all of those characters, they are actually not required to beat the game. YEAH every level was designed in a way so you can complete all of them with just the Nerd, but while this is true, certain parts of the levels will be a **** ton easier if you have a buddy along with you, so keep that in mind. Speaking of the levels, the level design, for the most part, is pretty good...that's all i can say about it. This is certainly good level design, but i feel like sometimes got lazy when designing some parts of the levels. Each level has some sort of gimmick in them, but aside from that each level plays pretty much the same way. One of the things that this game loves to throw you is death blocks (pretty self-explanatory), there's like a bizillion of them throughout the game and the placement can be very brutal at times. The levels have some very fun set pieces and creative enemies (tho some of them are just re-skins of other enemies).\n\nOverall the level design for the most part is really good, but there are some parts that are designed to anger you AND OMG they succeed. The game is hard, in a Castlevania, Ninja Gaiden, Zelda II, Megaman type of way. Now don't worry it's not as hard as any of those, but some of them can make say the phrases that the nerd says every time you die. But quite frankly only 2 of the 9 levels legitimately angered me and by the 2-3-4-6-8 playthrough of the level...it wasn't that bad and i felt like most of my deaths were fair and even if you feel like you are having a hard time, the game has different difficulty levels. I recommend normal mode for your first playthrough, it gives you 30 lives and 3 beers (which are this game life bar) and even in the highest difficulty, there are a lot of checkpoints throughout each stage.\n\nAt the end of every level there's a Boss which will require a different strategy to defeat and you will have to memorize the patterns in order to beat them, tho some of them are very easy.\n\nThe game has a lot of references to the Angry Video Game Videos and any AVGN fan (like me) will feel right at home with the over abundance of references, jokes and even cameos from other youtubers and enemies of the Nerd.\n\nSo overall with great graphics, music, bosses, characters, controls, decent level design, references and much more, Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures gets and 8/10. Definitely worth your money...and i can't wait for the sequel!!!.","March 22","true","9.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And after a few days, I'm definitely not disappointed.\n\nThe game is very reminiscent of many old NES sidescrollers, mainly Mega Man, as it uses the "choose your level" kind of gameplay like Mega Man does. And there's also.. running while shooting a zapper like in Mega Man.. yey. It makes it rather fun to play, while being rather nostalgic at the same time, which is also added on by the 8-bit style of this game. I also like the bit of challenge within the game, as some of the levels do make you think what you need to do, and being careful in general, giving a bit of strategy.\n\nAnother thing I like is how it has references to the actual show, with the powerups like the "Glitch Gremlin" and "Super Mecha Death Christ 2000," as well as having some of the characters such as Mike Matei, and even the levels do reference some of the games he's played. Not to mention, some of the things he says within the game and the cutscenes add some decent humor as well.\n\nSo, overall, It's a fun game that is definitely a good purchase if your a fan of the Angry Video Game Nerd, or even if you're not a big fan, but you like to play old NES games like Mega Man. Either way, it's still a good purchase.","May 23, 2015","true","8.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

For the three people around who aren't familiar with AVGN, he's a character whose life mission is to play some of the worst video games from the retro era. The original focus was the Nintendo Entertainment System, but games for others systems have also been covered. The brainchild of filmmaker James Rolfe, the nerd is a loud, vulgar, beer-swilling cad who bemoans his need to play these horrible games. The pain is eased in no small measure by his love for Rolling Rock beer.\n\nAngry Video Game Nerd Adventure is very much a fan service game, so it's the dedicated videos of his web-based show that will get the most out of the experience. Borrowing heavily from the 8-bit Mega Man games, the gameplay is classic, tough-as-nails platforming with insane traps, waves of enemeis and frequent deaths. Fans of the aforementioned Mega Man, Metroid, Castlevania and Contra games will appreciate the old school difficulty. While one-hit kills are frequent, you do have a life meter (a line of beer bottles) and you can find health power-ups throughout the level. Searching the levels also unlocks new playable characters. Each level is based on a trope from the AVGN series, with various in-jokes to the series providing much enjoyment to hardcore fans.\n\nWhile your enjoyment of the crass humor depends on how familiar with the AVGN series you are, the gameplay is accessible for most retro game fans. Your goal is to get from one end of the level to the next and defeat a boss, very simple premise, but the difficulty makes it an endurance test of trial and error. This is by design, since the game is a homage to an era where video games didn't hold your hand and "Game Over" meant just that. There is an easier difficulty setting for those who want an easier ride, but the true risk and reward comes with the more challenging settings. Since the platforming needs to be precise, I highly recommend playing with a controller over the mouse and keyboard. The game plays beautifully with my Xbox 360 controller, with fast, responsive and tight controls making the game a blast...even if I'm constantly dying,\n\nAVGN Adventures is not a perfect game, but it's a joy to play if you're a fan of retro side-scrollers and especially fans of the AVGN show. The full price is a little steep for some, but those who make the investment are in for a great time.","December 26, 2013","true","4.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/undox/recommended/237740/","undox","undox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/undox/","4210 products in account","For more than a decade, James Rolfe, AKA the Angry Video Game Nerd, has been reviewing some of the worst games ever made.  Now, he is not playing the games, but is in the games.  While playing a bad game is one thing, being inside one is another story.\n\nWith the game being based on the Nerd’s show, the game uses material from the various episodes.  This is what will make the game most appealing to fans of the show.  Throughout the game, references to the show make its presence felt.   From stages like Boo! Haunted House coming from his comments to characters like Stuttering Craig as the Ghost of Christmas Past, everything about the game feels like an interactive version of the show.  Even things like the Super Pitfall deathtrap make its way into the game.  To go even further, some people from the show like Guitar Guy are playable characters adding extra variety and strategy.  If you are a fan of the Nerd, part of the fun will come into to finding and determining where all the references are from.\n\nOne thing that is surprising about the game is the quality of the music.  Even though this is supposed to be like an 8-bit game, the music is at a level above that.  The way that the music is designed could easily fit into any electronic setting.  For those that found themselves enjoying the music from the BIT.TRIP series, the music will be a perfect fit.\n\nSince this is modeled after 8-bit games, the game also has their challenge.  Excluding the tutorial, every level in the game is hard.  Even with the easy setting’s generous checkpoints and lives, trying to clear a single area can be unforgiving at times.  A prime example of this is in the Haunted House level.  In that stage, the player needs to walk through a long corridor.  While in there, a series of death blocks with make navigating difficult.  That would make it hard enough as is.  However, these blocks are only visible when within a few steps away.  On top of that, make of the floor blocks will collapse when standing on them.  This makes it that either the player has to have fast reflexes or memorized the layout.  With such steep challenge, only those with high skill or tolerance will be able to finish.\n\nNerd fans will definitely enjoy the game the most, but platforming fans in general will enjoy it.  Its high difficulty is a problem, so casual players might find it too much to handle.  Just remember that he was originally the Angry Nintendo Nerd, and this game personifies the expression “Nintendo Hard.”","June 25, 2015","true","3.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

But one thing is for certain, I'd rather play this game than have a buffalo take a diarrhea dump in my ear. And I'd rather play this game over having to eat the rotten butt-hole of a road-killed skunk and then down it with a beer. Does this game make me the angriest gamer you've ever heard? Well no. Am I an angry Steam nerd? No! Because this is just a great platformer created for the sole purpose of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off James Rolfe, better known as the 'Angry Video Game Nerd'. And if you happen to be a big fan of the nerd, like myself, then this game is a must play.\n\nTaking everything the nerd has complained about over the years, one fan decided to take all of his negativity and transform it into an entertaining and often frustrating platformer. Insulting you with a barrage of disparaging remarks each time you die, I found myself getting just as angry at this game as the nerd does to the games in his videos, which surprisingly made the experience even more enjoyable to me on some sadistic level. Other than that though, there really aren't any negative things for me to say about this game. It's addicting, the controls work perfectly with a controller, the music is great, there's plenty of levels and bosses, it's funny, it's entertaining, it's great. Definitely worth the price and I don't say that often.","February 25, 2015","true","5.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","5","8","3","0"

I accidently bought this game while I was high and I tried playing it. It was basically impossible. You know those wave like pattern enemies in the castlevania games? Yea well the smart asses who programmed this obvious have some illness that makes them 5x bigger. Dodging them is a big hassle and worse of all IT STARTS YOU OFF ON THE MAP POINTING RIGHT AT THE LEVEL. So obviously your going todo that one first. Basically what i'm saying is I didn't even get to a boss fight yet because simply the game doesn't want me to get pass it. It's a shame because it has the potential to be a good game but they need to find the things in videogames that make people so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and multiply it by 100. Like I understand that this game is ment to be hard but come on. You don't making impossible to dodge obsticals. Atleast the game is good with lives. BY GIVING YOU 30. Yeup so this game knows it's hard but the question is why make it hard? As the nerd said in Lester the Unlikely, "Isn't the point of a video game to feel impowered? To be someone who you're not? Well so far it's the complete opposite of a videogame" WITH PRECISION LANDING IN THIS GAME WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ IS A PERSON TODO? YOU CAN'T JUST SPEED THROUGH IT! THE GAME WANTS YOU TO BE AS TEDIOUS AS POSSIBLE AND WANTS TO WASTE YOUR GOD DAMN TIME. Well I love the nerd/james with all my life but this game is ♥♥♥♥. It's LJN ♥♥♥♥. It's dickcock ♥♥♥♥. Like whoever would program such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game I have one question for you. WHY? WHY WOULD YOU PROGRAM THIS ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GAME?! It may seem i'm overreacting over this one simple thing but it's not. This game is labeled at 15 dollars. I could have bought a ♥♥♥♥♥on of other games with that and I decided im high, im going to play some nerd. WELL GREAT BECAUSE NOW IM DOWN 15 BUCKS.\n\nTL;DR - If you don't want challenge and aren't expecting the game to ♥♥♥♥ing kick you in the ♥♥♥ right at the begining than don't play it.\n","September 21, 2013","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

I started out hating this game but quickly started enjoying it. Aside from the sluggish controls, the game is fluid and fun. Paying homage to the great and the horrible games of the NES era, the game has quite a bit of variety but never strays too far from its roots. Being an NES-style game, it's challenging and makes completing a level feel a lot more satisfactory for it, but it's not hard to a point of frustration, at least not on normal difficulty. Being based on James Rolfe's character the Angry Video Game Nerd, the game has a lot of immature humor and unnecessary vulgarity to a point of tedium but if you can look past that, you'll find an enjoyable platformer with a nostalgic feel.","December 30, 2013","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Remember: This game is harder than just about any other indie game you would normally play (E.G. Super Meat Boy, Fez) And that is because of the 30 lives per-stage limit. I would reccomend you play the game on easy mode for your first playthrough. Other than that, There is basicly nothing wrong with the game, Its fun, challenging, has an epic soundtrack, and an 8-bit art style. The game controls fantasticly on both controller and keyboard. Upon beating the tutorial, You are presented with 8 stages, Most of which are themed off of a "♥♥♥♥♥♥ game" or AVGN area. And the levels that arent very related are packed ton with references, and easter eggs. There are also 3 other unlockable characters, Which are all based on AVGN episodes. Each level plays like a mix between Megaman and Battle Kid, Consisting of tons of enemies to kill, and a ♥♥♥♥-ton of insta-death traps.

The graphics and sounds are all glorious recreations of our 8-bit past. And while the gameplay is enjoyable and intense, the levels are sloppily developed. For example, the ♥♥♥♥ demons that you fight in "Thy Farts Consumed" can easily be dispatched from a safe spot without any effort. Most of the enemies are simply blocking your path and provide no challenge to get past.\n\nHowever, the strength of this game is the straight up platforming. This is the kind of game that truly makes you feel badass when you get past a series of spike traps and death blocks without dying once. Speedrunning would suit this game well for that reason, which the game promotes by showing clear time and number of times died upon completion of a level.\n\nWhile I think the game is far too expensive at $14.99, the novelty of it being The Angry Videogame Nerd, awesome music, hidden characters, and challenging platforming still make it a worthwhile purchase for fans. I am currently writing this review while it is on sale for 55% off. So if you are a fan of the AVGN, I'd say get this game and support him.","December 2, 2013","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A game that does no handholding, throws you into the middle of a world where you have to time your jumps and platforming, and punishes you for failure.\n\nAlthough some issues with the game would be mechanics such as the instant-death blocks, which feel like a cheap and lazy way to make the game difficult. Also it is generally believed that the game is a bit too expensive for the amount of content it brings, which is arguable. There may not be a whole lot of levels, but they are all challenging in their own ways and provide a lot for what they are.

The game puts you in the role of the easily angered, foul mouthed, ill tempered Nerd as he travels through 8 levels of "Game Land" inspired by "Video Game Land" from the late 80s cartoon "Captain N: The Game Master" while the gameplay is inspired by classic retro games like Castlevania, Contra, Mega Man, Ninja Gaiden and others.\n\nEach level has various nods to games from the past as well as games that The Nerd has reviewed on his web series. For example, the level "Beat it And Eat It" is inspired by the Atari Porn games for the Atari 2600, and the level "Boo! Haunted House" inspired by the "A Nightmare On Elm Street" and "Friday The 13th" NES games!\n\nThe most satisfying thing about this game is the challenge! Yes, areas of certain levels can be difficult and will even get you to curse like The Nerd himself, but that is what makes this game fun! The process of trial and error while playing through the game and being rewarded for beating the level instead of having you're hand held with a useless guide that shows you how to beat the level or give you recharging health or anything else that current games do nowadays. The game is still very fun as well as rewarding to play and gives you just that right amount of challenge that makes you want to keep on playing til the end!\n\nIf you are a fan of classic "NES hard" games like Castlevania, Contra, Mega Man, or Ninja Gaiden or are a fan of the AVGN character and his web series, then you should definitely get this game!","December 10, 2013","true","11.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I'd say one of the best things in the game is the music. It redefines NES music. Way more chords and bass drums; enough for it to be awesome, but not overused. The amount of humor is incredible for a game that was designed to be very challenging. It gets me stressed, but just enough to influence me to keep going. The references to the bad games James reviewed are everywhere and the bosses are even bigger references.

From the look down to the gameplay of  those terribly hard and unforgiving NES games we grew up to love and hate at the same time. If you have a few extra bucks and want to relive the past or you are a fan of the show pick this game up.

I'd say one of the best things in the game is the music. It redefines NES music. Way more chords and bass drums; enough for it to be awesome, but not overused. The amount of humor is incredible for a game that was designed to be very challenging. It gets me stressed, but just enough to influence me to keep going.

The game is hard, and usually still doable with some rage to it.\n\nHowever, I can't recommend this game to most.\n\nThe difficulty is actually the reason I gave up playing this game, as I never even beat it on Normal.  All the bosses fly in a figure 8 pattern and many add projectiles into the mix for added dodging.  I never did beat the final boss, even after 300 lives dedicated to him and his final level (After a while, I could usually reach the boss after burning half my lives on the level - the final boss probably killed about 120 of those lives).\n\nThe power ups are rare, so rare that I almost never bothered using them when I found one.  The 'balls' powerup is terrible (as it is supposed to be), the glitch gremlin can freeze things in or out of your way (really depends on timing), and Mecha-Death Christ is usually out of the way (dangerously), and provides a screen nuke for enemies that I can gun down without assistance.  The Super Scope is a nice boost of power, but goes away after just one hit from any hazard... you won't hold onto it for long.\n\nDont' get me started on the number of insta-death DEATH BLOCKS this game throws at you. You can't even try to count.\n\nIt's not the hardest game out there, but only the truly dedicated will beat this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anema86/recommended/237740/","anema86","Anema86","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anema86/","71 products in account","In their zeal to make a game that features all the things the AVGN has complained about, they managed to make a game that is only slightly below average. One would expect that the novelty would make up for it--having useless power-ups, cheap deaths, and all that were intentional design choices, after all, so you know that you're buying into that when you buy the game. In addition to this, though, AVGN Adventures has clear problems that should have been fixed.\n\nSerious Problems:\n\nMovement. The characters move with all the precision of Meat Boy. This makes playing the level "Beat Em and Eat Em", which features a ton of slippery surfaces, even more frustating. The imprecise controls are one thing, but there is something else that combines with them that, honestly, threaten to make AVGN Adventures unplayable. And that "something" is:\n\nThe camera. Rather than centering the AVGN, AVGN Adventures has him just slightly to the left of the center when you're moving to the right, and just slightly to the right of the camera when you're moving left. Changing directions on the fly becomes borderline impossible, because the camera shifts, too, which can and will totally screw up whatever difficult platforming section you were trying to get through. And that's a problem because of:\n\nKnockback. The knockback in this game is weird. I'd tentatively say that the knockback consists primarily of you getting hit UP, not backward or forward. In good games, knockback is predictable, and can even be taken advantage of. There's none of that here, and the unusual knockback will be a source of many deaths, simply because it's non-standard and very difficult to get used to. And, naturally, there aren't very many platforming sections that don't feature enemies coming at you, because:\n\nThe level design in AVGN Adventures is horrendous. It's dull, uninspired, and boring. As ProJared rightly pointed out, there are actually only a few enemy types in the game, and what they look like simply varies based on what stage you're in.\n\nAnd, as ProJared also points out, the developers substituted instant death blocks instead of creative level design. Predictable disappearing/reappearing Deathblocks appear in almost every stage, and they're not really difficult to get past; it just requires you to wait. There's a lot of waiting in this game. Something ♥♥♥♥balls is the most obvious offender: half of the stage is filled with instant death beams that are ridiculously easy to avoid and accomplish little more than making you wait for 3 seconds every 15 steps. This will almost certainly be the first level that you beat without dying at all.\n\nAnd you'll be glad to not die often, because dying is tedious. Even though there's an obscene number of checkpoints, even on Normal mode, death is a pain in the ♥♥♥ because the developers thought it would be funny to have a random AVGN statement about what he'd rather do than continue playing--every. single. time. you. die.\n\nAnd you die a lot. That's kinda the point of the game, supposedly being Nintendo Hard. But it's not. This is AVGN Adventure's main flaw: it PRETENDS to be Nintendo Hard by throwing a lot of cheap deaths at the player, but it's actually a very easy game. This is no I Wanna Be the Guy, which throws up a lot of cheap deaths AND is Nintendo Hard. I can't quantify what the difference is.\n\nIt's a short game. It can be beaten in just a few hours, which makes that $9.99 price tag WAY too high. For $2.99 or $3.99, I could recommend this. But at $9.99? You're paying more than $1 per hour for an experience that... just isn't that good.\n\nPeople often say that the music in AVGN Adventures is awesome. But that's not true. The only level in the game that has good music is Something ♥♥♥♥balls, and I'll give it that--that level's music is incredibly awesome. But that's only one-ninth of the game; what about the other 8 levels? They're nothing special, and a few are actually annoying. One stage has really awesome music, but 8/9 of the stages have boring, uninteresting music, yet the game is still cited as having awesome music. It doesn't. It has one stage that has awesome music. The rest of the music kinda sucks.\n\nAlmost all of the bosses are the same, too, including the final boss. There are one or two exceptions, but most of the bosses just move around in a figure 8 while shooting things.\n\nSo here you have a game that would have quickly faded into obscurity if it didn't have the AVGN's name attached to it. There's a sequel coming out relatively soon, and my sincerest hope is that the developers took a few lessons in creative level design before then, because I don't consider filling a stage with death blocks, using only 5 or 6 enemies, and making players wait constantly to be "creative". Even the final boss is just a rehash of several other bosses in the game, with nothing unique or new going on anywhere at all. Take that $9.99 and buy the Mega Man Legacy Collection instead. You'll get way more entertainment out of Mega Man than AVGN Adventures.\n\nTo that, you're probably saying, "Well, duh!"\n\nAnd that's my point EXACTLY. They're both $9.99.\n\n","November 11, 2015","false","10.2"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","1"

The major problem with AVGN is quite simply "we forgot people would be paying money for this." the satire about a person being trapped in a bad game you play is largely lost when you have to shell out money to play a bad game.\n\nThat's really the feeling I got the whole way through the game, the tropes and nods to the AVGN series are funny and entertaining but the bad game gets in the way quite hard. I really think they tried so hard to capture the "crap nes era experiences" that they forgot not only would people have to play this game but people would be paying money. its almost like it'd been less offensive to me had I paid for a movie instead, to watch someone else suffer through the game for my amusement than play the game myself.\n\nWhat makes this game terrible? death blocks that kill you instantly just to touch them which are EVERYWHERE to the point it felt like "we couldn't come up with something here so we'll fill content with these cheap deaths". "I wanna be the guy" style tricks and barebones mechanics are all over this game, however IWBTG was free and this you pay money for, so it makes things a lot more sour.\n\nIf you are an AVGN fan you already own this game so I wont be convincing you, but to anyone else looking at this game as a person looking for a platformer to play I def say wait for a sale, because the only appeal of this game comes from the tropes and humor nods to the series, the gameplay is powerglove bad. when I beat the game I did not feel like a winner, I felt like I used drugs.","July 9, 2014","false","44.9"," 21 of 41 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","21","41","0","1"

As usual, I'm gonna take the bad things the game has out of the way first:\n\nFirst and foremost, this game can be hard. It depends on your skills on these kind of games. Have you played the old Castlevania games? The 2D Metroids? Megaman? Or even f#cking Super Mario World? If you have not, then you're going to die more than any nooblord in the PC version of Dark Souls, trying to play without the patches, AND USING THE KEYBOARD INSTEAD OF A CONTROLLER. I'M NOT KIDDING. Of course, the game has many difficulty modes, depending of how much of a casual you are, but I got to the last level of the game in almost 4 hours, trying to find everything, and in normal difficulty. Of course I died a lot of times, but you're going to die, it's how this game goes.\n\nThe second thing that it might make you regret buying it, is the lenght of the game. It is entertaining and fun to play it, but it's not that long. Dude, It took 4 hours to get to the final level, and I'm pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good at these things, it might take you 6 or so to beat the entire game. You can of course replay the game in other difficulties and all that stuff...But there's not that much reason to replay it, unless you enjoy torturing yourself like the Nerd. And that's the last bad thing the game might have:\n\nIf you're not a fan of the Angry Video Game Nerd, or you don't watch his videos, then you're not going to understand shi#t. Pretty much 90% of the game are references to his videos and old-school videogame reviews. ALL THE BOSSES ON THE GAME, ARE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SEEN ON HIS VIDEOS (except the Giant-claw, I believe). Before picking up the game, you should check out his Angry Video Game Nerd videos, get some pop-corn, some Rolling Rock beers, have a good time watching him destroy those putrid mother of an #ss games. That said...\n\nThis game is BALLS TO THE WALL! It's been long since I found a game with ACTUAL CHALLENGE! I find games like Dark Souls a walk on the park, but this game actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off at random times, because it's as ruthless as games used to be, back on those times. What, you're a casual and a p#ssy? Play it on Easy, you have infinite lifes, double the HP, but in normal, you can take 3 hits before you blow up to pieces, and can only die 30 times before getting a Game over screen. The game over screen doesn't actually make you play from the start of the game, just sends you back to the level select screen, so it's fair, you can beat any level on your first try in 30 levels, if you're competent and don't f#ck up too much. In harder difficulties there's a limit of how much Game Over screens you can take before it actually ENDS the game for you, so yeah, pick your poison motherf#cker.\n\nThe graphics, along with the music, are the best thing of the game, everything feels like a mix between NES and SNES graphics, and the soundtrack is just AMAZINGLY AMAZING! I won't lie, the theme for "Future F#ckballs 2010" is probably the best one so far, SPECIALLY WHEN YOU MIX HEAVY METAL ON IT:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_MXefuJ9UQ\n\nThe Boss themes are also quite good, an 8 bit remix of the classic AVGN theme.\n\nThe game is also quite truthful to the Nerd style: Everything screams b#llshit and swears, he breaks the 4th wall a lot of times, and the Death Screens manage to make me laugh without any reason. They're just random generated text that makes no sense, but stuff quite fun to watch ♥♥♥♥ like this:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=322735188\n\nThe game is worth like 10€ or so, you might want to wait for a sale...But for less than 6€?

Developed by FreakZone Games and published by Screw Attack Entertainment this game has been a long time coming and many have looked forward to its release for some time. AVGNA is actually really hard, and almost makes me wonder what the Angry Video Game Nerd himself would say. The game fits into the online series perfectly and any Angry Video Game Nerd fan will love everything that they have incorporated into it.\n\nCovered in nostalgia this game stays true to the 16 bit era, and doesn’t stray from the path at all. I could think of a 100 things that would make this game better, but by adding them in it would drastically change how the game is perceived. When I first started, it almost felt like 1991, coming home from the video store after renting a new Nintendo game. The AVGNA logo sits on a black background with 3 choices, Start, Options and Quit, and reminded me a lot of the old 8 bit style games like Dig Dug or Excite Bike. The language in this game reminds me of Farrah Abraham’s porno, a bunch of awkwardly placed swears revolving around the words ♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥, whereas in this case its actually funny on purpose. Adding to the awesomeness of the game, not only is your main weapon an old school Nintendo Zapper, but you have enemies like Rob E. Robot and a defecating Rudolph the reindeer.\n\nThe story starts off with the Nerd and his friends playing a “♥♥♥♥♥♥” game together, when suddenly his friends are zapped into the TV. The Nerd escapes into the basement but an arm comes out of the TV and grabs him but the balls and pulls him inside. The game begins in Gameland, 3AM. From there the game brings you into a small training level to learn the controls and dynamics. After the tutorial, you are brought to a map screen where you have the choice of 8 worlds. Each are individually themed and named accordingly. To name a few, “♥♥♥♥♥♥♥vania” is reminicient of Castlevania and holds many obstacles similar to the ones you would have encountered playing it, “Beat It & Eat It” has elements of the adult themed Atari game Beat Em & Eat Em. Your ultimate goal throughout the game is to beat the boss at the end of each level and try to get yourself out of GameLand.\n\nAt times during gameplay I found myself almost trying to like this game, because upon initial gameplay I was almost taken back by the tremendous difficulty, I feel like this is one of those games where its simplicity makes it almost impossible. Your health is comprised of beer bottles, depending on the difficulty setting you choose you will start with either 3 or 5 beers. Like most platformers the bottles are scattered throughout each level and usually appear after a seemly impossible section to help replenish your life before its so callously taken away. Your main weapon is a Nintendo Zapper and if you can find the upgrade you also have the SNES Super Scope which fires faster and more effectively. Each world has hidden secrets and you can even discover new playable characters with different weapons and abilities. 1UPs are scattered throughout the levels to help replenish the lives lost along the way, as well as a few one time use abilities that have a variety of effects.\n\nI think what it all comes down to with this game is price and how its not reflected in gameplay. I respect the old school retro effect and any of my readers will agree with that, but this game would be amazing and I would love it 10 times more for 4.99. Due to the marketing of the game and the already house hold name of AVGN amongst gamers this game would be understandable at 9.99, but the 14.99 price mark is almost a dig at the fans. What it all boils down to is the game at its base and if its good or not. The graphics are a little more pixelated than I would have expected, and the ratio is a little larger than your normal platformer. The controls are on point and flow well with the game. Overall The Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures is certainly worth checking out, and will leave you just as angry as the Nerd himself.\n\nGraphics: 5/10\nPlayability: 6/10\nStory: 6/10\nChallenge: 8/10\nReplay Value: 6/10","November 28, 2013","true","6.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As usual, I'm gonna take the bad things the game has out of the way first:\n\nFirst and foremost, this game can be hard. It depends on your skills on these kind of games. Have you played the old Castlevania games? The 2D Metroids? Megaman? Or even f#cking Super Mario World? If you have not, then you're going to die more than any nooblord in the PC version of Dark Souls, trying to play without the patches, AND USING THE KEYBOARD INSTEAD OF A CONTROLLER. I'M NOT KIDDING. Of course, the game has many difficulty modes, depending of how much of a casual you are, but I got to the last level of the game in almost 4 hours, trying to find everything, and in normal difficulty. Of course I died a lot of times, but you're going to die, it's how this game goes.\n\nThe second thing that it might make you regret buying it, is the lenght of the game. It is entertaining and fun to play it, but it's not that long. Dude, It took 4 hours to get to the final level, and I'm pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good at these things, it might take you 6 or so to beat the entire game. You can of course replay the game in other difficulties and all that stuff...But there's not that much reason to replay it, unless you enjoy torturing yourself like the Nerd. And that's the last bad thing the game might have:\n\nIf you're not a fan of the Angry Video Game Nerd, or you don't watch his videos, then you're not going to understand shi#t. Pretty much 90% of the game are references to his videos and old-school videogame reviews. ALL THE BOSSES ON THE GAME, ARE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SEEN ON HIS VIDEOS (except the Giant-claw, I believe). Before picking up the game, you should check out his Angry Video Game Nerd videos, get some pop-corn, some Rolling Rock beers, have a good time watching him destroy those putrid mother of an #ss games. That said...\n\nThis game is BALLS TO THE WALL! It's been long since I found a game with ACTUAL CHALLENGE!

Each world has hidden secrets and you can even discover new playable characters with different weapons and abilities. 1UPs are scattered throughout the levels to help replenish the lives lost along the way, as well as a few one time use abilities that have a variety of effects.\n\nI think what it all comes down to with this game is price and how its not reflected in gameplay. I respect the old school retro effect and any of my readers will agree with that, but this game would be amazing and I would love it 10 times more for 4.99. Due to the marketing of the game and the already house hold name of AVGN amongst gamers this game would be understandable at 9.99, but the 14.99 price mark is almost a dig at the fans. What it all boils down to is the game at its base and if its good or not. The graphics are a little more pixelated than I would have expected, and the ratio is a little larger than your normal platformer. The controls are on point and flow well with the game. Overall The Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures is certainly worth checking out, and will leave you just as angry as the Nerd himself.\n\nGraphics: 5/10\nPlayability: 6/10\nStory: 6/10\nChallenge: 8/10\nReplay Value: 6/10","November 28, 2013","true","6.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I don't always find it funny, and I generally enjoy Jame's videos more for the information and content than his "angry" rants.  However, this game has it's funny moments - and the cameos always made me laugh.  But most importantly is that THIS GAME IS INCREDIBLE.   If you play on the easiest setting, and are an experienced platform gamer, you should be able to play through it withing a couple hours of game time (if that).  But then this feels like a classic "go back, play it again, do it better, find everything, beat it on higher difficulty" style of game play.\n\nThe controls are incredible - and I use a Logitech F310, so nothing perfect, but the game feels amazing.  The contoller support is wonderful, as well.\nIt plays in a similar manner to a Mega Man game with it's intense platforming... but it runs much faster and much more smoothly.

What makes this one different from all the other retro style platformers is that it is based entirely around the concept and exploits of the Angry Video Game Nerd.\n\nAVGN decides to play a pretty bad game, as he usually does. However, this game decides to pull him through the TV, sucking him into the world of terrible videogames and bad videogame tropes. The plot is very simple, and only really serves the purpose of giving you the setup to actually play through the adventure.\n\nIf you're not really a fan of the AVGN series of videos, then this isn't for you; the whole game is designed to be a playable homage to the Nerd and everything that the fans love about him and what he does. The whole game is jam-packed full of references that most people familiar with the series will get and appreciate, as well as a number of deliberately bad game design choices that make their way in as a result of his frequent complaining of said issues in many of his reviews. It all adds up to a game with themes that are very faithful to the titular hero.\n\nThe levels are deliberately very tricky, and oftentimes you'll find you die a lot in each one. Most of the levels often have instances of trial and error. You will most likely die not knowing how to navigate certain obstacles the very first time, or not react quickly enough not knowing what's about to come. To offset this style of difficulty, the player is given a total of 30 lives to work with. This is usually enough to make it from beginning to end of a level. But it's in this feature that lies my main criticism with the game.\n\nThe system of 30 lives to make it through any given level is fine, however my main issue with this is that upon completing a level, your remaining number of lives will carry over to the level you play next. This means that unavoidably you will always start subsequent levels with significantly fewer lives to work with, and you might find that you won't even have anywhere close enough to beat a level the first time. Get a Game Over, and you lose your checkpoint progress.\n\nThere is no way to reset your lives count except by getting a Game Over, either. I've tried to save, quit and come back into the existing save to see if that would work. Sadly the save does save your current lives count, meaning it was intentionally designed that way. So if you begin with a meager 5 lives, you will either want to just kill them off at the start or use them for practice in the early part of the level, because you're probably not going to get too far with them.\n\nThat issue aside, AVGN Adventures is a really fun game for fans with great graphics and awesome 8-bit music.

It's not groundbreaking, but it's still an experience.\n\nI think that in order to like this game, you need context of who the AVGN is, and more specifically, what he most often complains about in video games. If you don't have enough context, this game IS MOST LIKELY GOING TO  come over as bad.\n\nPros:\n\n- The writing is whitty\n- The controls are tight\n- The music is ♥♥♥♥ing great\n- The visuals are incredible.\n- The gameplay is fun and challenging\n- There are a nice handful of easter eggs\n- No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t\n- No ♥♥♥♥ing DLC\n- Faithful to its source material.\n- The powerups are awesome and useful\n- It has a lot of AVGN references, but not too many. It doesn't try way to hard to be faithful to its source material.\n- The array of characters you can play as who actually have useful abilities.\n- Well programmed and almost flawless in performance minus some user triggered glitches.\n\nCons:\n- The level design is suppost to troll you and be like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games the AVGN plays. He always complains about that kinda ♥♥♥♥ in his videos so it makes concept crucial.\n- Sometimes it can be very unfair. Some parts of the game can really ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ you off\n- Way too much trolling\n- Bosses seem to be more luck than skill when beating them\n- Some segments you are required to take damage. It's either that or I'm just really ♥♥♥♥ at running along 10 second long floors where spikes occasionally pop out of the floor, and the roof and jumping into the roof spikes, hoping I won't take any damage.\n\nOverall, it's a really fun game. I'd recommend playing with a controlled, because afterall, it is a platformer game. These kind of games are made to be played on controllers.\n\nOverall rating: 7.5 shitpickles out of 10\n\n","February 24","true","3.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheOneTrueVisi/recommended/237740/","TheOneTrueVisi","Visi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheOneTrueVisi/","396 products in account","Every gamer has heard of AVGN, and almost definitely seen at least one episode. Excessively vulgar, harsh, and, well, angry, the Nerd debuts in his first official video game, "The Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures". This is just going to be a brief overview of the game.\n\nThe game consists of a total of 10 stages à la Mega Man style. There is a brief intro stage, followed by 8 stages that can be done in any order, and a final stage available after the previous 8 have been completed. Each stage parodies one or more games/themes, with countless references to AVGN videos. Said references range from in-your-face things like lava sharks, to things as subtle as unremarkable enemy patterns that were only featured in a single video of the 100+ episodes. There are also several secret characters from all of Cinemassacre that can be unlocked once located, and switched to at any time during gameplay. In addition to all of this, there are plenty of cameos that are strewn throughout the game featuring internet personalities like Egoraptor, Angry Joe, and The Completionist.\n\nThe graphics are a fantastic recreation of the classic 8-bit era, and the overall design  of the characters and levels is just incredible. The music though... wow. The game really shines in this department. Every song is absolutely amazing, and there's even a kick ♥♥♥ little beat that plays whenever you pause the game (a reference to the Battletoads episode). "Future ♥♥♥♥balls 2010" is probably my favorite track. The controls are very tight and about as perfect as a platformer's controls can be. It's really difficult to describe, but as soon as you start playing, you'll understand. The one thing that took some getting used to is the positioning of the Nerd. The Nerd sticks his gun out, and it's completely to the side of his sprite. The area where the gun is takes no damage, but the character sprite does, but because of the size of the gun I naturally see the point at which they connect as the middle, which caused a lot of misjumps and deaths early on.\n\nOne thing has to be made clear... this game is hard. Very, very hard. Some of the difficulty stems from complaints AVGN has made about games in his episodes, and were seemingly intentionally put in the game to cause anger and frustration. A relatively skilled gamer can get through it on Easy with some patience, but difficulties beyond that require much more skill, patience, and dedication. This game is truly challenging, and will seriously ♥♥♥♥ you off at times... but strangely in a good way. Like, just enough to make you want to beat it, so as to prove to it your superiority. There are several difficulty levels that are unlocked by beating the game on the previous highest difficulty setting. To beat the game on the very highest difficulty would probably take the caliber of a demigod.\n\nOverall, the game is a kick ♥♥♥ platformer, but damn is it hard. At it's current price, it's hard to recommend it to someone who isn't a AVGN fan. I beat it on Normal in around 5 hours, but I died about 500 times and I'm pretty skilled at old school platformers. To me, there's pretty high replayability, as I want to try and beat it on the highest difficulty settings, but to someone who isn't into old school "♥♥♥♥ you" hard platformers or aren't a fan of AVGN, A single run through (if that) is probably enough. If you like AVGN, you should pick the game up. If you don't, but you like extremely challenging old school platformers, you might want to give it a shot, but all of the show references will go unnoticed, and there's an enormous amount of humor and nostalgia there, as this game is a hate-filled love letter to AVGN fans. If you're casual... stay away. Far, far away.","September 25, 2013","true","9.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The worlds consist of mechanics , level themes and references to other video games. (It even has a porn level)\n\nHowever as much as I personally enjoyed this game I feel if you aren't an angry video game nerd fan you wont enjoy it very much. However if you can ignore the language and you like games you can die in a lot over and over again and takes time and memorization to get good at it then this is the game for you.. but I can't see to many people enjoying this.

Let me try to be as objective as possible here. AVGNA is a game that, let's face it, is designed around the problems that James Rolfe has pointed out in his over 100 videos for his popular web series, the Angry Video Game Nerd. AVGNA is mainly a tribute to his legacy of video reviews, but which manages to capture the spirit of that show while also providing humorous dialogue and some pretty fun levels. The control is very good (best played with a controller), the graphics are appealing, the health pickups and one-ups are relatively plentiful, and there are numerous checkpoints scattered generously across the levels. The music is very catchy and gives the game a strong sense of energy. I also enjoyed how you can play as different characters who have different weapons and abilities, if you could find them.\n\nNow let's get to the major complaints. Yes, this game is full of cheap kills. That's part of the point. This game is full of meta jokes because you're playing as the Nerd who has to fight the summation of obstacles that have plagued so many of the terrible games from his youth. As I was playing, I was really thinking "Wow, this stuff really must've been horrendous" in reference to the games he had to beat for his show. But the beautiful thing about this game is that I feel it never exceeds the threshold. The "cheap" sections really aren't that long, and the difficult areas are always preceded by easier sections that are meant to teach you the tricks or gimmicks of each level.\n\nFor people who are debating whether or not to buy this game, I would say that if you're a fan of AVGN and you like platformers or played them as a kid, give this one a go. In terms of 2-D platformers that have come out recently, this is definitely one of the best. The level design actually had quite a bit of thought put in, and even though it can be frustrating, if you're smart enough to figure out basic patterns and patient enough to repeat certain sections, you won't regret getting this game. I've been a big fan of James for years and I think that this game stays true to the basic feel of the videos and the attitude he exudes as the Nerd. Plus I loved the humor and self-referential jokes.\n\nTo respond to negative reviews, here's what I have to say: There's no way I can understand complaints about this game being too difficult. Compared to some of the games people of James's generation played growing up, like Super Ghouls and Ghosts, Silver Surfer, and Battletoads, AVGNA is a walk in the park. AVGNA was made as both a parody of bad games and as a send-up of the games that defined "Nintendo-hard." Kids these days are coddled. This game isn't really that tough when you get down to it, nor is it unfair. As for complaints that the game is padded, you could say that for any platformer. The only platformer I've ever seen with a decent storyline was Braid, and this game is definitely not that. Is AVGNA worth $10? I suppose it's subjective, but I had more fun with this game than I did with several other more expensive games that may have technically better graphics and more of a story but fail at having an interesting character or unique feel. This game doesn't feel recycled, it feels new and different, in spite of its origins from past games. In other words, it synthesizes elements from both the AVGN show and from the games themselves, but I felt that when notoriously bad elements were included, it was always for the sake of humor, and they were treated in a relatively fair manner, even though some people find the game to be grinding.","August 29, 2014","true","4.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

It seemed like a fun game based on the visuals and concept. Being a fan of the AVGN series I wanted to support that as well.\nBut boy do I regret spending those buck.\n\nThe controls are so stiff that jumping on a platform fails in most cases. It feels like they were intentionally made stiff to subtract from the ability to steer the nerd. The truth I however fear is that the guys who made this  game are inexperienced game devs or simply have no skill in their trade whatsoever OR were so busy thinking of foul words that they didn't have time to test if the game was actually playable.\nThe good humor from the series is more or less absent in place of just swearing endlessly.\nIn regard to the indie AVGN fan games I've played (watch episode 115 if unsure of which I'm referring) this doens't present much original content.\n\nThe level design is really bad as well. I haven't played for that long because I more or less ragequit due to all these issues I'm adressing here. But I did play all stages. And they're the same: Unfair when they should instead be challenging.\nI've played and beaten tons of platform games. Especially old and hard ones. But this simply isn't fun.\n\nI wish there were more positive things to say about this.

It's filled with all of the things that make the Nerd the Nerd. He complains about various design choices along the way, and when you die you're given a randomly-generated complicatedly vulgar insult about how much he hates the game. Levels, enemies, bosses, and even the pause menu music are based on games he's reviewed. There are plenty of cameos from the Nerd's fellow Internet personalities, and various characters that have been on the show. And the final level and final boss are exactly what and who they should be.\n\nPlus, you know, the level design's pretty darn good, too.\n\nAVGNA is designed to delight through the frustration. It's not I Wanna Be the Guy hard, but it's a tough-as-nails platformer. And what would you expect, considering that this is not only an homage to the Nerd, but also to the frustratingly difficult and poorly-designed games that he's played over the years. But therein lies the mastery in this game. A good parody should include the things that made the subject awful, but without actually being awful itself. It's a challenge, but AVGNA pulls it off without breaking stride.\n\nI mean, it's not perfect. Most of the stages contain a number of the same enemies, only reskinned to suit that stage. Which, of course, is all part of the big parody. But the invincible things that fly in infinite circles start to get pretty tired by the end.\n\nAlso, the final boss will rock your world. Difficulty is gradual in the game. You can play the stages in any order you want (and can revisit completed ones, if you so choose), but if you play them in the order they appears on the stage select screen, you will find a pleasant steady increase in difficulty as you go. That said, the final boss was much tougher than anything else I faced. I got him eventually. But man did that take FAR more tries than any obstacle before it.\n\nThe music is great, and whatever you hear perfectly suits the situation you're hearing it over. The game is visually appealing and colorful. Controls are responsive, which is a must. The Nerd shoots as fast as you can tap the button, meaning speedier button mashers will have an easier time with most of the bosses (if I had just gotten two more taps in, I could have killed the first boss during his very first vulnerable period). The four different characters (three of whom must be unlocked) each have their uses, and I found myself using each one in different situations over the course of the game. There could be more powerups. By my count, there are four, and one of those can ONLY be used by the Nerd himself.\n\nAlso, you get to kill Navi 10/10GOTYAY","October 9, 2014","true","3.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The bosses are a tad lackluster, too, as they follow the traditional NES format and have a really, REALLY predictable pattern, with a form of artificial difficulty coming from the speed the boss moves at, and the tight space you have to maneuver in.\n\nIt's definitely worth its price, though.

People who don't like the comedy style of AVGN or don't know him will probably just get annoyed with the game and the story as a whole. There is swearing everywhere but its just text, there is no voice in this game and the story is told via text boxes with drawn art cards depicting scenes at the start of the game and the end. Honestly, story is negligible and really isn't to the concern of the player in these sorts of games. Its all about gameplay.\n\nYou play as the nerd or one of four characters you can find. You can hot swap between these characters and some may make situations easier but in all honesty all you need to beat the game is the Nerd and Guitar Guy. The nerd being perfectly fine with all situations aside from those the Guitar Guy is required. Each character has their own special stats/move so you can have some choice about how you accomplish a goal. But for the most part their is really only one way to get by most obstructions. Jump a second to soon or late and you die or get hit. This is to be expected with this type of game but it does get annoying as you progress and insta death blocks become more and more common.\n\nOh yeah, insta death blocks. Some of the biggest bs to ever grace this game and they are everywhere. I mean EVERYWHERE. They are just plain overused, like the dev couldn't figure out how to give a fair new challenge to the player so they just tossed insta death blocks in everywhere they could which is especially painfull as you get more and more stuff on screen and you have to pay attention to all of it to keep from getting hit. Once you figure out when to jump, run, or whatever it stops being such a challenge unless a glitch or so messes you up.\n\nWhat I found is the game has really strange hit detection. Sometimes things that clip into your character don't hit you (enemy attacks or insta death stuff) but sometimes you can be not even near it seemingly and it kills you. Exactly how close you can be to something before it kills you is something I still havn't figured out. It just seems like luck that you live or die, especially in the last insta death dissappearing and reappearing block puzzle. You just have to keep trying over and over until it lets you through. Of course skill does come into play but I can't tell you how many times I thought I was in the clear only to have the blocks appear and instakill me although I know I was clear of them. Its complete bull. This same problem can happen with platforms but it seems to be limited to falling platforms I think. You can jump and get stuck on the corner and then the platform falls.\n\nBouncing is a game of luck aswell. You can try and get good at it but even when you think you have it down your character desides to take a suicide dive straight into insta death. Its like playing with fire while soaked in gas, you have to have the patience of a saint and a surgeon in one to do it right.\n\nControls are solid aside from the bouncing mechanic which is like the wheel of misfortune. Your character controls very smoothly and solidly aside from times when you need to do jumps perfectly on a single block with an instadeath right beside your intended jump spot. At times like that its easy to overjump and die or under and fall to your demise but this maybe also something to do with the weird hit detection. I really wish I would have recorded it in slow motion to see exactly what was up.\n\nBosses are a pleasant challenge and once you figure out there pattern they are pretty easy, but thats after you die a good number of times though. Fred Fuchs, the final boss, is an absolute pain in the rear as he is right after the most horrible level in the game. Once you get past beginners traps and turtle your way to the end you will have no lives, but even with knowing the level well you might only get to him with 20 lives and let me tell you that you'll probably need them. What I did was crouch on the lowest right platform and when I could I would jump up and shoot him as he flew up until  he brought out his balls. When hes got his balls out (hehe) crouch on the left side of the platform when hes flying to the left side of the screen, and when he flies to the right side of the screen get on the left sideof the middle platform and crouch. When he starts crapping on you you have to pause the game to see if he is going to ♥♥♥♥ above you, then you have time to react and dodge him. I would advise shooting at him while hes above you then pausing fast as you can when under him. It seems like cheating, but honestly since the crap is random its fair in my opinion. When he brings out his wrecking balls or chain balls (whatever the heck you call them) get on the two platforms farthest to the left.\n\nThere you go, Freds dead baby!\n\nPowerups are fairly rare and and theres only 4 types, beer for health, the SNES gun, mecha jesus, and the glitch gremlin. The gun sucks because in one hit you lose it, and the gremlin is mostly useless as it only stops enemies and fire balls and similiar dangers like that from moving. It dousn't make them stop damaging you so its pretty useless aside from points where you get lucky and you line everything up so you can run through an area without getting hit at all. Mecha jesus kills everything on screen and is only really used around where he can be picked up.\n\nThe game is pretty goofy, just like AVGNs style but people who arn't familiar with this may become offput by that comedic style. But its all taken from the show and I even chuckled out loud when I saw some of the enemies, text, and levels in general. They nailed AVGN, maybe a bit to well.\n\nThe graphics are farily nice and colorfull. Not as good looking as Bastion, but still good looking. The music is also good stuff. I can't remember if its the same song throughout the game as I was to focused on playing the game. Which I think goes to show the music is good if it didn't annoy me and helped me keep my head in the game.\n\nAnother bad point is the acheivements, I don't think its possible to get them all. YOLO seems impossible and impossible seems masochistic. I died over a 1,000 times but I had to play through the game twice. Oh yeah, twice! Not even on purpose. I wanted to see other difficulties and without thinking and half on accident I pressed new game but I didn't select a difficulty. The stupid game deleted my save. THIS WAS IN A NERD VIDEO! This was one of the most basic things and they screwed it up. You have one save file and nothing else but you can go in and edit he save file I think in order to skip parts in the game. I didn't do this because I didn't feel like cheating and possibly disabling acheivments since I just don't know what it would do to them.\n\nIn summary and TL:DR\n\nAVGNA is a rather good game with alot of throwbacks to the old games featured in AVGN. Unfortunately it is somewhat flawed in some very annoying ways and takes to many of the things that just ♥♥♥♥ gamers and AVGN off and puts them in this game. Its much better though than most 2d Platformer games around these days as instead of trying to be someing silly like art it just tries to be a fun video game and succeeds for the most part. But technical hitches here and there do creep up at times and can be very annoying when they do but its hardly a constant problem.\n\nIt can be very challenging, but also very rewarding when you do finally beat a level and eventually the game. The only really big issues are hit detection (because when it does creep up and become a problem you can waste several lives with it) and some of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t jumps or puzzles that are just stupidly difficult. The game is pretty goofy, just like AVGNs style but people who arn't familiar with this may become offput by that comedic style. For better or worse they took everything from the show.","February 26, 2014","true","9.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

And while AVGN Adventures did at first, it quickly became one of my favorite indie platformers ever. While I'm not the biggest fan of AVGN, it's quite interesting to see a game with his type of humor. Controls are tight, graphics are appealing to the eye, sundtrack is great, and the game is quite solid overall. It's like Mega Man in that you can choose any level in a non linear order. While the game is difficult, practice makes perfect, and there are harder difficulty options that will make you pull your hair out (I don't know how anyone could beat YOLO mode). Overall, I really enjoy this game. Short enough to replay a lot, fun to play, and pretty solid game overall. I'll give it an 8/10.","September 3, 2014","true","10.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game will last you about 4-6 hours, depending on how good you are at platformers, This game is very similar to Megaman 3 when it comes to control, flow, and level design, but even more difficult. If you don't like to die a lot, then a game that is easy to get an achievement for dying 1000 times isn't for you.\n\nThe game lets you shoot in all directions, except down for some reason. This is a nit-pick worthy note to me, as he does claim to put elements of all his favourite side-scrollers together, which one of them is Super Castlevania 4.\n\nAll the great AVGN moments are referenced, with the Couch / Guitar guy, Bull-♥♥♥♥ Man and even Mike Matei, James' best friend and co-worker, being playable. You will see halarious moments, such as the "Pitfall first ladder" rant being heavily enforced. You go down the first ladder in one of the levels, and instantly fall to your death into a chamber of lava, spikes, and flame-sharks (which, by the way, you get to ride later!).\n\nThe humour is exactly what you would expect from a game written and designed by James Rolfe. Sarcasm levels reach 9001, as the nerd himself will comment on the "♥♥♥♥-factor" of the game. When I was playing the "Beat it and Eat it" level, which pays omage his Atari Porn Games episode available only at his website, I hit a slippery spot on theground and fell to my death saying "God damnit, stupid ice... wait. That's not ice."\n\nLevel design is very good, but enemies lack real depth. While the poop jokes were kind of novel in 2007, the just aren't best served wth a dish of platformer.\n\nOther minor issues I have found are that sometimes you don't get a chance to read the text. It took me quite a while to find out how to switch characters, as the only time it tells you without going to the option screen to my knowledge is when you meet your first alternate character. Another small problem I ran into was the music bugged out on Blizzard of Balls, looping indefinately until I closed the game entirely. This never reaccured, so it may have been fixed in one of the regular updates Mike and James roll out every few weeks.\n\nOver-all, if you are an AVGN fan like me or retro-loving gamers, it's a must-buy at a respectable 8.5/10. For non-fans and platform haters, it's a non-impressing 6/10.","September 11, 2014","true","29.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's really short, really repetitive and WAY TOO HARD. The enemies that you find in each level are all the exact same enemy but with a different look, and the music isn't very good. And the randomized rants at the game over screen are also really repetitive. The controls are also really unresponsive sometimes and really hard to play with unless you're using a controller. And, whenever you change the controls, you have to set them again after you quit the game! It's really annoying! My reccomendation is to get it when it's free or SUPER on sale. Like, 30 cents sale.

I have heard mixed reviews on the game but I would like to interject my ideas and likes about this game. As well as my dislikes.\n\nFirst of all, the game was designed to be a challenge, a hard game, designed from the AVGN's experiences with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games he had played on various consoles. As one would think, this game is more geared to those who are fans of the AVGN, to those who arent, they wont do so well with this game and will get angry fast.\n\nI'm not saying just non-fans would get mad, I did too at times but I found it funny. I felt the Nerds pain with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games and this was it. The game is unfair, very hard, challenging, and unforgiving on some accounts and that is why I like the game.\n\nThe inside jokes are awesome, if you are a fan of the AVGN like me, you would see all the jokes and laugh at them. Even the final level is a whole joke. Though to be fair that level is hard as balls.\n\nI dont recommend this game to those who arent fans of the AVGN, and I would recommend it to AVGN fans but if you are fan, you most likely bought it already.","February 13, 2014","true","20.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Next thing, he's iinside an 8-bit platformer getting nagged by "Naggi", the patronising firefly. Press A to jump? Thanks. "You're a ♥♥♥♥ing genius! Now leave me alone."\n\nAfter that tutorial, we get a selection of stages. Clearly, it's the largest AVGN game yet. I'm using an Xbox controller and the controls feel a 100% fluid. There is no doubt about it, this is a legitimate side-scroller; proving that the genre is still alive and strong. You don't even need to go back to the past, we're still in the past. And why is the music so ♥♥♥♥ing awesome?\n\nYou can play as hidden characters, like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Man, Guitar Guy, and Mike. ... Who the ♥♥♥♥ is Mike? I don't know anyone like that. Not to mention, there's lots of hidden cameos, see if you can find 'em. There's also powerups like Super Mecha Death Christ, which obliterates everything, and the Glitch Gremlin, who makes everything go berserk.\n\nY'know, I've heard a lot of people say this game is very difficult\n\nOkay, whoever came up with this is-- (The in-game Nerd's text says: "Whoever came up with this level is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!") --exactly. They read my mind, they're an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! Which means the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who made this game acknowledged that they're an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and that I called them an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! You ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nGreat, do I really need to be reminded of Silver Surfer again? Why does everything look like a ♥♥♥♥? Oh, no, not the where'd-you-learn-to-fly ♥♥♥♥♥! Then, there's the happy land where everything is smiling. No matter where I die, or how I die, there's always one of these things makin' fun of me! (Smiling, happy-faced sun-faces are bouncing all over the level.\n\nThe death screen always generates a random quote, saves me the work of trying to come up with somethin'. Let's try Dungeons & Dickholes. (descends a ladder, and the next screen scrolls down to reveal an impossible death trap! The become is horrified!) Now, this is goin' too far!! When the AVGN came up with this idea during my Super Pitfall episode, I didn't know somebody would actually create this exaggerated death trap! I can't even blame anyone but him! He came up with this! What was I THINKING?!\n\nWhat THE ♥♥♥♥? Nooo way. They didn't... It's the Giant Claw. It's as big as a battleship, how did it get in this game? It just barged right in, like a battleship crashing into a harbor. It's takin' so many hits, like bullets on a battleship. It's a flying battleship!\n\nThis isn't the first time the Giant Claw appeared in a video game, it was also in another FreakZone game based on another terrible movie: Manos: The Hands of Fate. So, it begs the question: When will the Giant Claw strike again? Hmmm.\n\nThe movie was filmed in Hollywood, Manos was filmed in El Paso, I originally broadcast out of New Jersey. Hmmm, I don't see a pattern.\n\nNerd: The next is a level based entirely on the Atari Porn games. Who would do that?! Don't look, kids! Then, there's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥vania, it's as if you took all the things that were frustrating about the Castlevania games and the Megaman games, and put them all together! The biggest obstacle are these Death Blocks: you touch 'em, you die. It's all about getting these patterns down, and there's hardly any room to ♥♥♥♥ up. Ugh, undershot it. AUGH, overshot it! You think there's enough Death Blocks?!\n\nThen, there's Blizzard of Balls, a Christmas snow level. Nothing says "Christmas", like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ chickens! The best part is killing Santa, and using his body as a sled. On the polar opposite: we have the Hell level: Thy Farts Consumed, where you fight Cacodemons. You ride on a shark shooting lasers! ... This is ridiculous. Then, of course, you fight the Devil himself!\n\nAnd don't you love the intentional typos? "Conglaturation!", is that the new, hip way to spell it? Is what the kids are doing now?! The remaining level is: Boo! Haunted House. You have to play the whole level in tunnel vision, and this is where they get really get carried away with the Death Blocks! Even when you know it's there, it's still hard not to touch it! Oh, WHAT?! Oh for ♥♥♥♥ing... Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh God! Oh, oh God! I--AIUHM, ♥♥♥♥!\n\nAfter you've conquered all the stages, one last, final stage appears: Laughing Joking Numbnuts, the bane of my existence! This is deliberately designed to be one of the most unfair stages in video game history. For example: You have to shoot this gear to make the platform move, but then, you're killed by the Death Block. So, you have to jump faster than your own bullet. And, after that, more Death Blocks appear out of nowhere! Meanwhile, there's all kinds of ♥♥♥♥, flying everywhere!\n\nThere's not one stable spot to stand to catch your breath. You gotta keep movin', you don't even have time to think! Look at this: LOOK AT ALL THESE DEATH BLOCKS! I hate 'em! I hate 'em as much as the ♥♥♥♥ing Medusa heads in Castlevania! Or the grass in Bill and Ted. Every game has its thing, and this ones' thing: IS TO ♥♥♥♥ ME OFF! It was made to ♥♥♥♥... ME... OFF!\n\nAnd at the heart of it all, the final boss: my arch-nemesis. It's... IT'S... Fred Fuchs. It's the programmer mother♥♥♥♥ing Fred Fuchs! (spelled "Fred ♥♥♥♥s" on the screen) ...Finally, I get to kick his ♥♥♥! Yeah, ♥♥♥♥ you, Fred Fuchs! URGH! ♥♥♥♥s you, Fred Fuch! AHHHHHHH! Got 'im!\n\nNerd: (He blows a heavy sigh of relief.) Feel like I played every bad game I ever played, all at once! And now others are playing it... because of me! It's like I shared all my horrible experiences! It's all my fault! ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME!","May 5, 2014","true","32.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's really short, really repetitive and WAY TOO HARD. The enemies that you find in each level are all the exact same enemy but with a different look, and the music isn't very good. And the randomized rants at the game over screen are also really repetitive. The controls are also really unresponsive sometimes and really hard to play with unless you're using a controller. And, whenever you change the controls, you have to set them again after you quit the game! It's really annoying! My reccomendation is to get it when it's free or SUPER on sale. Like, 30 cents sale.

The game will last you about 4-6 hours, depending on how good you are at platformers, This game is very similar to Megaman 3 when it comes to control, flow, and level design, but even more difficult. If you don't like to die a lot, then a game that is easy to get an achievement for dying 1000 times isn't for you.\n\nThe game lets you shoot in all directions, except down for some reason. This is a nit-pick worthy note to me, as he does claim to put elements of all his favourite side-scrollers together, which one of them is Super Castlevania 4.\n\nAll the great AVGN moments are referenced, with the Couch / Guitar guy, Bull-♥♥♥♥ Man and even Mike Matei, James' best friend and co-worker, being playable. You will see halarious moments, such as the "Pitfall first ladder" rant being heavily enforced. You go down the first ladder in one of the levels, and instantly fall to your death into a chamber of lava, spikes, and flame-sharks (which, by the way, you get to ride later!).\n\nThe humour is exactly what you would expect from a game written and designed by James Rolfe. Sarcasm levels reach 9001, as the nerd himself will comment on the "♥♥♥♥-factor" of the game. When I was playing the "Beat it and Eat it" level, which pays omage his Atari Porn Games episode available only at his website, I hit a slippery spot on theground and fell to my death saying "God damnit, stupid ice... wait. That's not ice."\n\nLevel design is very good, but enemies lack real depth. While the poop jokes were kind of novel in 2007, the just aren't best served wth a dish of platformer.\n\nOther minor issues I have found are that sometimes you don't get a chance to read the text. It took me quite a while to find out how to switch characters, as the only time it tells you without going to the option screen to my knowledge is when you meet your first alternate character. Another small problem I ran into was the music bugged out on Blizzard of Balls, looping indefinately until I closed the game entirely. This never reaccured, so it may have been fixed in one of the regular updates Mike and James roll out every few weeks.\n\nOver-all, if you are an AVGN fan like me or retro-loving gamers, it's a must-buy at a respectable 8.5/10. For non-fans and platform haters, it's a non-impressing 6/10.","September 11, 2014","true","29.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My old one had over 100 hours in this game when I switched last year, and in total now it's around 200.\n\nThe music and difficulty in this game is great. The gameplay is solid and is very similar to how the NES megaman games would play out.\n\nPlaying this game on the harder difficulties "Hard As Balls+" is a real challenge. Well done to you if you can manage to beat it on any of those, without exploting or going back for extra lives. It'll keep you busy for a long time if you set out to complete those.\n\nThis particular game is the one that got me into making my own 2D platformers. I wanted to make custom levels for this game so badly, but there is no level editor in-game. (And there doesn't need to be really, since this is targetting AVGN, it wouldn't make all that much sense.)\n\nHere's an example of a custom idea: https://zippy.gfycat.com/DesertedUnpleasantGuillemot.webm\n\nI can't say I'm as involved with it anymore now, but it's still a fantastic game overall. If you'd like to test out this game before playing it, I made a near-direct copy of the tutorial level in HTML5, which you can play in your browser using the link below. It's really funny to compare this to my original version of this, it shows how awful I was at creating things back then.\n\nhttps://frisk.itch.io/avgn\n\nAVGNA is well worth a buy if you like old school platformers.","May 14","true","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I really do. The game was clearly created with AVGN fans in mind, and is so filled with references to episodes that you'll really like how many cool touches they are to the game. From The Nerd's death trap from Super Pitfall, to the three spirits of Christmas from the Home Alone episode, you really wouldn't believe the amount of in jokes have been added to the game.\n\nBut I have to look at this from a gamer perspective, and honestly? It's one of my least favourite 2D Platformers to date. The developers fell into the Mega Man 9 pittrap of flanderizing Nintendo Difficulty by thinking "throwing down as much ♥♥♥♥ as possible" is all fair game. Unfortunately, it isn't. It isn't good level design, it isn't good difficulty balancing, it's simply fustrating, simple as.\n\nAnd I know the joke of the game is meant to parody the silly things in bad games, but that's the problem right there. The game can lampshade the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ design, and cheap layouts as much as they want, but it doesn't change the fact they're present in the game, and they're unbelievably annoying to deal with. From rooms filled with Death Blocks, that are in unbelivably idiotic layouts and locations, to the point where it feels like flat out luck to get past them.\n\nAnd if you have to play this game on a keyboard, get ready for even more pain, because the keyboard controls are even more of a pain to deal with, and unusally glitchy. For example, I tried to switch the layout to use W,A,S,D as the arrow controls, but as soon as I started the level Future F**kballs, The A button wasn't letting me walk left, instead just turning the character in that direction.\n\nThere are also four playable characters in the game, these including AVGN himself, Couch Guy, Mike, and Bullsh*t Man. Unfortunately, I only found myself playing as Mike, and Couch Guy for most of the game.\n\nAVGN isn't a bad character, and he's useful for situations where you need balanced jumping, but Mike has a very powerful ranged attack, and an extremely high jump, which makes platforming slightly easier, while Couch Guy has a very good long range weapon that arcs, and goes through walls, and he has the fastest speed of the characters in the game.\n\nThe worst character by far however is Bullsh*t Man. He has a double jump, but his speed is so terrible, his weapon is so useless because it isn't long range or very powerful, and his normal jump is terrible, with his double jump just giving him a very slight boost to make him have the normal jump of maybe Couch Guy (The third worst jumper in the game).\n\nThe cameos in this game are also kind of cool as well. Seeing Angry Joe, The Completionist, and Jim Sterling in the game was certainly a cool little surprise. That said however, there was some really glaring obmissions, and I'll give you AVGN fans one guess as to who it is.\n\nTHE NOSTALIGA CRITIC THATS WHO.\n\nI mean seriously, even if Nostalgia Critic hasn't done many game reviews, he's still done Blues Brothers, and Babe's Kids, and he's done a ton of video game movies/tv shows, and that doesn't even talk about the fact that NC is Angry Video Game Nerd's rival. They had a battle that the internet still remembers to this day.\n\nJames Rolfe himself has cameoed in NC's movies, as well as Doug Walker (The person behind The NC) cameoing in the AVGN Movie, so I was incredibly disappointed that he didn't even get a mention in the game, when other Youtubers like Egoraptor did get a cameo (Personally, I'm not a fan of Game Grumps, but that's more personal opinion more than anything.\n\nOn top of that, the extremely fustrating level design of the game also ends up ruining some of the jokes. For example, it seems very clear they created the game with a death toll in mind, like Super Meat Boy did, but where Super Meat Boy was a fast paced platformer with extremely short levels, AVGN Adventures takes more of a Mega Man style, which really doesn't suit the style. Mega Man levels are generally very long for a death toll kind of idea, and when the player is getting killed over and over by cheap layouts, rather than their own fault, then it only ends up fustrating them.\n\nIt doesn't help that when the player dies, they get a random quote from the AVGN talking about how the game is a pile of ♥♥♥♥. The problem is there's only about 10 to 20 of these in the game, and so, by the time you hit maybe the end of the first level, depending on which level you start on, you'll be so sick of these quotes. What makes it even worse is you can't skip past them until you've seen the text written out, meaning you have to wait about 5 to 10 seconds each time before you respawn.\n\nIf there's any positives to the game, the graphics are pretty good, and inspired by SNES games, and the music is surprisingly really awesome, and as I said, the injokes, references, and cameos are pretty cool to see, but in general, AVGN Adventures is a completely disappointing mess of a 2D platformer that falls into almost every pitfall that the Nerd has pointed out in bad games over the last  9 years.","November 29, 2015","false","3.6"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajpos/recommended/237740/","ajpos","Andy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajpos/","483 products in account","There is a hidden genre of game known only among the hardcore: "platform hell." Among its top echelon is the classic,  "I Wanna Be The Guy," which inspired Steam games Super Meat Boy and VVVVVV. Platform Hell games are identified by one simple trait: the game knows what you are about to do, and punishes you for doing something predictable. A cloud mighdisappear as you land on it, for example, or an apple may fall off a tree UPWARDS as you attempt to jump over it.\n\nAs a cataloguer of terrible video game tropes, it is natural that the Angry Video Game Nerds includes many, many, surprises in this game. However, AVGN-Adventures is nowhere near as difficult as these other platformers and is slightly less fun.\n\nThe Good:\n\n* Awesome level variety harkening back to several classic video games.\n\n* Dozens of allusions, cameos, and references to Angry Video Game Nerd episodes, classic video games, and video game tropes.\n\n* Your character's light-gun changes color depending on the difficulty level. Pink for easy, orange for normal, and gray for  "old school." (I was never able to reach one of the higher, unlockable difficulty levels).\n\n* Like Nintendo games of yore, there are plenty of secrets to find.\n\n* Great use of humor.\n\n* Each level ends with a unique boss from nerd-culture.\n\n* Fantastic pause music.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n* The levels are a bit short, although they make up it with their difficulty.\n\n* The "You've got Skill" Steam achievement is duplicated... there are two of them for some reason.\n\n* Control Issue: It is hard to fire your gun to the right if you recently started moving left, and vice-versa. This becomes very annoying.\n\n* Some enemies, like the reindeer on the snow level, have "magnetism" or something and stay right ON your sprite. since your gun can only fire outwards, it makes them lethal and unfair to fight.\n\n* The game uses the enter key as a pause button, but if you shift+tab out of the game to talk to someone, anytime you hit enter to send your message, the game pauses/unpauses.\n\n* The only level that is truly "really difficult" is the last one, which is only unlockable after completing all other levels.\n\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n* At times, the game felt more like a chore than a game. I got bored after playing through the first level, but only stuck it out to write this review.\n\n* The game only has a few special items: useless rocks, super scope, "glitch man," and "mecha Jesus."  (I'm making up my own names for these things, I forgot what they're killed.) I was expecting to discover more items as the game continued, but no, there are just the four of them.\n\n\nThe Verdict:\n\n* Pick this up if you like AVGN or platformers, but don't expect a rock-solid experience. I personally did not enjoy my time with it.","September 20, 2014","false","3.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Then I played it.\nFirst of all, this game isn't enjoyable. Not only is it so hard that anybody who struggles at completing a single stage from any Mega Man game shouldn't play it, (the difficulty didn't bother me), but it's just a genuinely BORING game. And that surprised me. I've never been bored playing a platformer, so that should say a lot about the game.\nIf you are passionate about platformers and love them like I do, chances are this game is going to make you never want to play one again, simply due to how... well, boring it is, when it shouldn't be boring at all.\nIn other words, boring and difficult (which is only a problem if you're not that good at platformers).","August 29, 2014","false","0.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It has great controls, but its level design is ♥♥♥♥-poor. There's a difference between being hard but fair (Castlevania, Mega Man) and just being cheap, especially with the kill blocks. When you die, you're presented with a randomly generated slew of cuss words from the Nerd, but that won't hold people off for more than a minute. There are plenty of platformers that are more fun to play than this, though I really wish the level design was better, because that with its perfect controls would just be amazing. It's basically a game that had a lot of potential and failed because they chose to make it hard, not knowing the difference between making something fair and unfair. And I've had plenty of experience with retro-style games (played Ninja Gaiden, Castlevania 1 and 3, Mega Man 2 Difficult mode [Can actually speedrun it in about 40 minutes with no game overs, a pretty good record]) so this is coming from someone with experience.","April 13, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xdancingmad/recommended/237740/","xdancingmad","xdancingmad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xdancingmad/","36 products in account","Let me start off by saying I'm a huge AVGN fan. I have been since 2005 or so when I was just barely 14. I support him 100% enough to buy his DVDs and his movie. I think he's a great reason why gaming on the internet is such a popular thing, especially the whole "I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off so I'm going to make up words to coicide with what I think about this game" fad. But this game... Not even remotely worth your time.\n\nFirst off, let me express my UNDYING HATE FOR SETTING UP THE CONTROLLER. I had a struggle just like everyone else, and it's almost a year past it's last patch. Every controller I plug into this PC is recognized by EVERY game I own. This game? Nope. I had to fidget with the advanced settings just to let the game recognize my controller. And as much as I wanted to use my Xbox One controller, I was limited to my 360 controller.Hell, even my PS4 controller worked, What a bunch of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nSecondly, this game does a great job at making you FEEL like the ♥♥♥♥in' nerd. I couldn't help but go through the game and say nearly the same kind of lines AVGN uses in his own reviews as I went through each stage just to cope with how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the levels are. But that's the only good thing it has going for it. Just because you FEEL like the ♥♥♥♥in' nerd doesn't justify a 9.99 dollar pricepoint and it's extrutiatingly difficult levels (especially the final level).\n\nThere's a difference between intelligent and clever level design that pushes the boundaries of difficulty (Kaizo Mario is a great example of this)  by utilizing every single mechanic to to be frustratingly hard, but you envy it because the way the level is set up is extremely smart and well-thought. This game? This game is just a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥. You like invisible blocks? How about death blocks that force you to die upon touching them. Hell, this game has INVISIBLE death blocks! Granted, it's tied to two specific levels, but the game is already hard enough. That's just a small sample of how the game forces you to cope with the ♥♥♥♥ it gives you. It isn't clever. Just a huge ♥♥♥♥.\n\nYou'll blaze through 30 lives like it's no one's business, but 30 lives is about enough to get through a single stage... Excluding the LJN stage. This is the only forgiving mechanic in the game, seeing as your only punishment is restarting the stage and not the entire game. Each live gives you three hits before you're done, but the game isn't very sparing of these magical ales. It's pretty ruthless. I've gotten to the final boss of the game and blaed through 75 lives. That's three seperate playthroughs of the level, by the way.\n\nFinal thoughts. The game does a great job emulating how The Nerd feels when reviewing games. That's it's biggest pro, and possibly the only pro. This game isn't clever or smart or forgiving or whatever. It isn't like Super Meat Boy where everything you do is your fault so you can't feel too upset about it. Nope. This game didn't justify it's original 14.99 dollar price point or it's 9.99 dollar price point. I'm more than glad I only paid 3.99 for this hunk of ♥♥♥♥.","October 3, 2015","false","3.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Make no mistake: This is one of the hardest games ever.\n\nAt its core, Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures (AVGNA for short) is a platform and action game; comparing it to Mega Man is a fair reference.  You carry a simple blaster fasioned after the old Zapper light gun peripheral for the original NES.  You can occasionally pick up a rocket launcher in the design of the old Super NES peripheral, the SuperScope.  The platforming is tougher-than-nails, and very few of the stages are what I might call easy, even after multiple attempts.\n\nThe overall atmosphere and level design are very well done.  It's easy to see the retro influence in the stages.  For example, the sky stage features monsters fashioned after the Air Tikkis in Mega Man II; another features a labyrinthine castle-like section clearly inspired by Zelda II: The Adventure of Link.  The enemies in these stages are suitably varied, as well, and much of the game's music is also well done.  From an aesthetic point of view, the designers did a great job.\n\nSo now we need to discuss the afore-mentioned difficulty.  I find the challenge in this game to be completely uneven and outright sadistic at times.  The game is clearly meant to be retried over and over and over again; why else would you start out with 30 lives?  You're only ever given three units of health (indicated by beer bottles, of all things...); there is no way to earn more.  You lose a full unit with each hit and can only ever recover one at a time by finding beer bottles within a particular stage.  One-Ups are also extremely scarce.\n\nThe old standby of getting hit to become invincible for a couple of seconds works somewhat in this game, as well, though certain hazards ignore your invincibility frames and can still kill you on contact, similar to how spikes ignore invincibility in the original Mega Man.  Often, enemies will hit you and knock you into such a hazard; when hit in this game, you do recoil, whether on the ground or in the air, making it very easy to fall into a pit, as well.  Additionally, if you have picked up the rocket launcher, a single hit from an enemy takes it away; you don't even get to carry it until you lose a life.  Given that it's almost always positioned in a particularly nasty section of a stage, this makes it almost worthless as you are almost guaranteed to lose it as soon as you get it.\n\nThe introductory stage is deceptively easy; in fact, I completed it in one life on the very first try.  Once I reached the main part of the game, it took me many tries before I even found a stage I could complete.  You luckily can tackle stages in any order you choose, and you only have to restart a level entirely if you lose all lives within it.  For the most part, the checkpoints are plentiful enough that you rarely have to repeat lengthy sections, and you always restart at a checkpoint when you die, provided you have lives remaining.\n\nOne of the problems I found with the game, however, is with collision detection.  Even this is somewhat uneven; sometimes, you can get right up on a hazard, such as the skull blocks, but other times, having even a single pixel touching a hazard is death.  I found this to be particularly true with the Rainbow Beams in the final level; many times, I couldn't even TELL I had a pixel within range of one, then suddenly found myself exploding in bloody death.  Play control also seemed tepid sometimes.  I would try to turn in one direction only to have the game not respond at all.  My inconsistent experiences with these aspects of the game only added to the overall frustration.\n\nBut the primary reason that I can't recommend this game is simply the final boss.  It is almost without question the most unfair boss battle I have ever played in a game (I'll revisit this opinion once I finally complete Dark Souls I'm sure...).  Even after I learned his patterns and put myself in the best position possible for the first couple of phases, his brutally strong defense, the trap-filled lair, and the near-impossible climax to the battle forced me to waste literally HUNDREDS of lives before I could finally win.  I ultimately felt that after all the time I had put into learning the individual stages and even being able to get to his lair within a reasonable number of lives, the effort was wasted as the final boss just decimated me again and again and again.  I feel like a small amount of luck was involved in the run that was ultimately successful.  I'm relieved that I never have to fight him again.\n\nAnother big issue I had was with random crashes.  I experienced more than a few during my playthrough, and all sent me back to the Windows Desktop.  This happened several times when I reached the boss of a level, or after I had managed to finally get through a particularly difficult section with many lives left in reserve, forcing me to do everything over again.  It even happened in the final stage after a particularly good run through the first few sections.  I would say I experienced roughly 10 such crashes.  Given that most games I play rarely, if ever, crash, this ended up being another obstacle to completing it.\n\nIf it weren't for the random crashes, and if it weren't for the almost impossible final boss, I could give this game at least a cautious recommendation.  But when the final challenge of the game makes everything you've done up to then feel pointless, that's when it goes from just a hard-core challenge to something more masochistic in nature.  After awhile, it just stopped being fun to try and overcome it.  As it is, I can only recommend this to the hardest-core gamers of this genre.  Just be prepared to want to break your controller in half.\n\n5.5 / 10","December 26, 2014","false","9.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

As in, badly designed. So making a game that is badly designed is "hilarious parody" I guess, but in general it's just poor overall.\n\nSome levels are ok. Others (the Halloween, Ice, and final levels in particular) are REALLY bad.\n\nPlenty of in-jokes for fans of the show, but honestly his rampant cursing with no substance behind it doesn't translate well into text format. It's funny to watch James lose his mind in a scripted, real-life setting, but having the AVGN persona just sort of spew random "hilarious" swears constantly (and mostly directed about how much he hates the game, which we are playing and hating as well) isn't satire or comedy. It's just...kind of sad, honestly.\n\nAs a masochore platformer it's ok but not great, mostly because of the aformentioned bad level design.

Anyway, you should know who the Angry Video Game Nerd is. He single handedly started everything to do with gaming videos online. He's a foulmouth nerd who has dedicated his life to warning the world of bad games, whilst being absolutley hilarious at the same time. If you have never watched him, what are you waiting for> Go watch an episode right now 'cause you're really missing out.\n\nAnyway, the game starts the Nerd being sucked into one of these terrible games and must get ou. Simple, right?\nLadies and Gentlemen, I now present to you my least favrioute thing about this game...\n\nTHE DIFFICULTY IS OFF THE CHARTS!!!\n\nI never usually loose my temper with games. However this one really started bugging me within 5 mins of boot up. Not trying to spoil anything, but I was in sweat and tears during the final boss fight. I tried for an hour and couldn't do it. I managed to develop a stratergy for part of the fight, but died something like 400 times. I gave up all red and in tears. The next night I went back and my strategy still worked, but I was still struggling. So I used a walkthrough, combined it with my stratergy and I finnaly did it!\n\nAnyway, the point is this is easily the hardest game I've ever played. Even on easy. I'm impressed just beating it once on easy only having to use a walkthrough once!\n\nBut, the real problem here...\n\nIf you watched AVGN for as long as I have, you probably will have memorised some of the things he complains about in games. And, without listing them, I can tell you this game has ALOT of these problems. Its like it took inspiration from bad games!\n\nWHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!\n\n(Sigh...)I usually decide whether I'll reccomend or not reccomend a game beofre reviewing, but this time I'm really struggling. This game almost ruined AVGN for me. I went through sweat and tears just to beat this game on the easiest difficulty! However, it has gogeous retre graphics, occasinally fun gameplay and, of course, the Nerd. Due to it taking too much inspiration from bad examples of games and not being entertaining 100% of the time, it is with great sorrow and regret that AVGN Adventures is the first game I dont reccomend on Steam. Still buy it, play it but not till the end. It is the most brutal and unforgiving game I've ever played.\n\nDid I mention the feeling when you finnaly beat it...?\n\n","May 13","false","4.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The game is intentionally bad, using various tropes from so called "♥♥♥♥♥♥ Games" as the nerd calls them. Such as death traps without warning, higher difficulty settings with generally unrealistic expectations.\n\nThe game is quite short with only nine levels. Nine very hard levels (Especially Laughin' Jokin' Numbnuts and Boo Haunted House.) There's only nine, the description says ten, but it's counting the tutorial stage, which I really wouldn't as it's that short and without challenges.\n\nA big part of the game is memorization, once you know where all the sudden death traps are and the trick to them. You can pretty much do it every time with the boss (There are a few with no rules outside of "Kill them before they kill you, ♥♥♥♥ dodging, just hope they die before you do) so it's more for the Nerd Inside Jokes. So as I said, if you're an AVGN Fan, pick it up when it's on sale (This game isn't worth 15, but 5? definitely.)\n\nYou'll laugh hard, so hard you'd rather have a buffalo take a diarrehia dump in your ear! In this game where ya die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die. Because the difficulty is LEGENDARY!\n\nOh and for those who do buy, play the game in this order, Future ♥♥♥♥balls 2010, Dungeons and Dickholes, and Beat It & Eat It. This will help you unlock the hidden characters. Guitar Guy will be needed for his speed, Mike for his jumping, and BS Man for when you need to kill enemies fast.\n\nAnyway, yeah, like I said, if you've seen AVGN, buy it when it's on sale, if you haven't give it a pass. I'd reccomend it at full price if it didn't use artificial difficulty (I get that it's part of the joke, but still), and was longer.\n\n\n\n\n","December 3, 2013","true","27.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's FUNNY, right?" (See: Evoland.)\n\nThis is an awful game and you should not spend any money or time on it. Go play the games it's "paying homage to" instead, because at least those had the excuse of being trailblazers when they screwed up, rather than sucking out loud on purpose. It's no fun and it's very telling that the people championing it, now that I can easily scan popular reviews, are sincerely using the term "casual" as derogatory comments about people who don't want to suffer through rehashed jokes that as far as I can tell, are just quotes taken from AVGN reviews verbatim instead of his actually writing new lines.\n\nAlso? I remember this era of consoles. If you're going to go far enough to rip it off wholesale, get the graphics right and put in a little extra effort rather than the mishmash of art design this nightmare works with. Absolutely nothing looks like it blends together and I'm pretty sure some sprites were ripped directly from old games and changed just enough to be ♥♥♥♥-coverage.

But after seeing the writing in this game, I doubt it’s for me. Different tastes and all.\n\nStill, this game suffers greatly from “Claptrap syndrome”. You see, Borderlands’ Claptrap is annoying on purpose, but he is still. Really. ♥♥♥♥ing. Annoying. Most of the time. This game’s writing, references, and humour are so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ [and I do hope, on purpose] -- and downright hate-filled [if you hate this kind of thing so much, why do exactly the same?] -- that even good platforming could probably not help it. And here comes the kicker, it doesn’t have good platforming either. You might want to fool yourself and call it “hard”, but this is not the ‘Super Meat Boy’ or ‘They Bleed Pixels’ good-and-hard kind of hard, it’s just the pretty-bad-and-thus-hard kind of hard.\n\nIf you’re not a fan of ‘AVGN’, best stay away.","August 27, 2014","false","1.2"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","1"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews - Game 9\nAngry Video Game Nerd Adventures\nPurchase Date: 8/25/2014\n\nThe first splash screen I see is "Rated F for ♥♥♥♥balls".  I did not realize at the time what valuable information I was being given.\n\nThe first thing I realize is, this game is clearly intended to be played with a controller.  The main menu flashes "PRESS START".  After some quick trial and error, I figured out that the Enter key means start.  After a couple of quick screens to explain the story (such as it is), the game starts with a tutorial level.\n\nThe main character provides some expletive filled commentary as you run, jump, and shoot your way through the level.  It didn't take me long to die due to a mistimed jump, which caused me to fall through the floor.  That means instant death in this game.  You also have a number of beers, which you can think of like hearts in a Zelda game.  Every time you hit something bad, you'll lose a beer.  If you lose all of your beers then you die, and get sent back to the last checkpoint.\n\nIt became very clear that the game intends for me to die.  A lot.  Every time I die, the main character gives an expletive filled comment about how much the game sucks.  After dying the 20th or so time at the same checkpoint, you start to get his point.\n\nThe graphics and sound are fine, and do a good job of evoking the retro feel the game goes for.  It does look and sound like a game you would have played on the old NES.  Which I think is also the point of the insane difficulty as well.  I should mention, the game does give you a choice of difficulty, so there is an "Easy" mode.  But it doesn't really make a difference.  Easy mode just means you get unlimited continues and more beer.  But more beer doesn't keep you from missing a jump and dying.  A lot.\n\nOnce I made it through the tutorial level, I was presented with a list of levels to choose from.  I appreciated the fact that I could make the choice myself, and the game wasn't completely linear.  Each level has a different theme.  For example one level is based on Castlevania, and contains a lot of the same traps and fiends you'd expect to see in a Castlevania game.  Another level is based on D&D and has an appropriately fantasy theme.\n\nI do have to give props to the workmanship put into the game.  I think it took a lot of work to make a game this hard.  The level design is very good in that regard.\n\nI only ended up playing about 40 minutes of this game.  After sampling a few levels, I realized I didn't need to play any longer to understand what I was in for.\n\nUltimately I can't recommend this game.  But I want to be clear that the reason I'm not recommending the game isn't because of it's difficulty, but rather I think it has a limited appeal.\n\nYou should buy this game if you are:\n\n*15 years old\n\n*A fan of the Angry Video Game Nerd\n\n*Are looking for a video game to take you back to the days of throwing your controller at the TV when you were trying to get past that level in Battletoads.\n\n\nIf you are not any of these things, then this game was not intended for you.","June 19, 2015","false","0.6"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","5","13","0","0"

The graphics are pretty sweet and the music is awesome. The control is good and unique in its way, comparable to Mario, but slightly stiffer. Be warned for very frustrating level design. Fortunately, there are many many checkpoints on the way and you get 30 lives to start with. That should give you a good idea of how this game is designed and I like it a lot.\n\nThe reason for not recommending this game is because of technical issues. This game does not play well on a keyboard so I highly recommend using a controller, but besides the Xbox 360-controller, getting standard Windows controllers up and running is way too hard to do and required the use of third-party software, plus there's a bug that introduces 8 seconds load time after every death when using the controller, which is horendous. These are issues that were mentioned a lot in the forums, so I am not the only one. As such, even though the game is fun and creative, I cannot recommend a game that is technically underdeveloped. I have tested version 1.7.1 from february 2014.\n\nOther than that, this game begs to be played on a tv with a controller in your hand, rather than on a PC. I would like to encourage the developers to make it run natively under SteamOS. This is one of those games that would benefit from an open console platform.","March 16, 2014","false","3.1"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

However, visually, the game does look very nice, with all the levels having different appeals and themes. The music is pretty good too, and the game makes lots of references to past AVGN episodes, except they stop being funny very quickly.\nIn short, don't buy this. Go google 'rage games' and click one.

Got all the way to the final @#$%ing level and face the final boss with 20+ lives lost all of them tried it again and did this until I hated myself. the problem is in general the bosses in AVGN adventures are so poorly designed that it really sours the feeling of the supposed hard but never unfair BS. All of the bosses and I do mean all of use a figure eight patten maneuver and it never feels very well planned out in fact the exact routes always feel random other than its a @#$%ing figure eight you got nothing else to go off of. Most of the bosses are passable and least somewhat forgivable for this crap until you play the cheep @$% final boss than your basically like @#$% this not like there a goddess getting ready to blow me if I beat this @#$%ing thing. I actually enjoyed most of the rest of the game the levels are hard as @#$% yes and their all trial and error but so is megaman the difference why I actually got through these levels I guess because on normal you do have 30 lives. I have heard that there's a YOLO difficulty which is exactly what it sounds like and I don't want to even imagine what that's like. however at the end if the day I guess the question is can one boss, even the final one, ruin a game for you so much that your just like @#$% this game? Well it did for me don't buy this unless your really into masochism even more so than Dark Souls (which is a hard @#$ game I did actually beat), do buy the soundtrack though its @#$%en awesome as hell.","February 28, 2015","false","8.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","2"

Anyway- There's a difference between hard and unfair. If a games hard, that means it's doing its job right, but, if a game is just plain annoying, that means that the devs just didn't really try. Lets take Super-Meat-Boy, for example. The game is hard, but not unfair, because every situation has a solution that can be solved by everyone, regardless of their age. Now, with the AVGN Adventures, it's just plain luck. You have to try 100's of times, and what is worse is the death blocks. They're just there to make the game seemingly harder. The Dragon Boss fight on Thy Farts Consumed would be a pretty hard-ish boss fights, but adding death-blocks? You can shoot the Dragon, sure, but you gotta move constantly, trying to fight him.

The early levels are actually reasonably fair with few surprises that can't be overcome with a bit of skill. The later levels however are designed to kill you over and over and only thorough memorisation will get you through.\n\nThe retro visuals and soundtrack are impressive and probably the best part of the game. The "Nerd" humour is frankly vulgar, childish and often disgusting. A better showcase of the steep decent the series has taken since it has begun, and not what made it so sucessful in the first place.\n\nThis is a hard one to recommend if you're not a huge fan of the AVGN. If you're looking for a deliberately punishing platformer than you'll want to check out Super Meat Boy. If you've done that and want something more, this probably won't be much more of a challenge.

Creating a game about the Angry Video Game Nerd seems like the next step in breaking the AVGN brand into a new medium seems like a natural progression. The end result, however, just ends up being a dull and charmless. The worst of it, just being downright dull.\n\nThe best way to take a look at the game would just be to start up at the top with the man whom the title is named after. The majority of the comedy of the AVGN is in his delivery, his facial expressions, and over the content of the game. That gets lost when the extent you see of his anger is a simple "This game is a bunch of diahrea ♥♥♥♥ coming out of a rabbits ♥♥♥♥." readout in a slow text. It is true that a majority of the nerd's history is present in the game but it suffers the problem of being a reference alone without really adding much of anything unique to the game. (i.e. The Robot Jesus Christ being a general screen clearing attack.)\n\nThis extends to the game itself, while it's true you'll find a challenge here that isn't part of the problem. Challenge in itself can be dealt with if the core of the game itself is interesting and fun to play and that simply doesn't apply here. Across a generic song backdrop the game it plays almost exactly like run and gun flash game you play on the internet with generic challenges, all the while reading Angry Video Game quips slowly sprawled across the screen. The problem I had with the game itself was the challenges to the game being repeated ("Skull deathtraps") with each stage being a homage without doing anything really different to the formula that changes the game up in any reasonable manner.\n\nIt strikes of an idea that sounds interesting in paper but not in practice. Angry Video Game Nerd playing all of his past games he's slammed? Sounds like a reasonable and interesting idea. Playing the stages without varying the levels up to a significant degree? That's when the game starts going downhill. What could've been an interesting formula just descends into a dull  and unexciting game that doesn't really justify spending the higher spending price. Angry Video Game Nerd fans will be mildly amused by the nods present in the game but as a whole the Nerd's style of humor doesn't translate well into text form leaving them dissapointed. People looking for a challenge will be turned off by the overall dull game play and design despite the colorful stages offering no incentive to continue playing. I'd skip this even if you are a huge fan of the Nerd.","January 19, 2014","false","0.9"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

Mechanically, it has a lot in common with classic NES Mega Man, but the dificulty curve is through the roof.  Its designed to be nearly unbeatable, except through reptition and learning to beat a level the hard way, much like super meat boy.  The art and music are great if you appriciate 8/16 bit era looks and sounds and there are lots of nods to both nerdy culture and classic games that any retro game fan is sure to love.  Sadly, the game is too lude and crude for its own good... It doesnt' try to be witty and instead hopes that you'll find tastless nonsince amuseing, but I didn't.  I'm sure the humor will appeal to someone, but not me, and it will likely appal the average person.  If you love dificult, retro stylized games and can enjoy or ignore course and disguesting content, you'll love this game, especially considering its low price point!  Sadly, for the average gamer looking for old school platformer thrills, i'd have to suggest you instead look to polished, longer, less offensive games like cave story+, super meat boy or rayman.","March 18, 2014","false","2.2"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

Game which is made official by Game Trailer themselves [and some other dev i guess]. Game  story is all about Nerd and his friends trying to get out from the world of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Video Game which sucked them right at the beggining. Is AVGN Adventures game is good or atleast passable? NO! But did it succeded? YES! Indeed the game is really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but that's the whole point. This game teaches you how games were back in a day, hard or really frustrating, though those are the good sides but game got it's own ammount of problems.\n\n+Good Visuals, 8-bit themed like it's 80's NES era all over again.\n+Music is great too, they are like more clearly arranged tracks. Nostalgia is all over the place.\n-There is literally no story in this game, nerd get's sucked into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game and tries to escape, that's it.\n-Glitches everywhere, oh and i'm not talking about glitch gremlin here. For instance i hope they will atleast fix the achievements.\n-Poor character skills and controlls, Mike is a worst character in the game, poor range and his way of finding secrets is a joke. You will beat this game as a Nerd anyway, there is absolutely no point to these characters.\n\nFinal Verdict: 5.0 Mediocre [Will NOT recommend for full price, and if you're AVGN fan..

Clearly, this game was designed to appeal to casual gamers as well as AVGN fans. The controls are very responsive and easy to pick up (I would argue, for all its simplicity, it's some of the best controls I've ever used), and, despite what many have said, the difficulty is balanced fairly, sitting on that line between easy and frustratingly hard to provide healthy challenge. Compare this to say, Worms Revolution or Pokemon Battle Revolution (nominal similaraties purely coincidental), where much of the challenge comes from how unfairly rigged the game and the AI are against you, and you can appreciate how good a game this is. As a fan of the Nerd myself, I also enjoyed the sheer volume of references and characters crammed into the game, and the many cameos from other reviewers (though no JonTron, Spoony, Yahtzee or Nostalgia Critic? REALLY?). The music is also fun to listen to and has a lot of variety. The main complaint I have with this game is also a warning: if you miss a level-specific achievement, you can't replay a level you've already completed or start a new game to go back and do it without your old file being erased. This caused some frustration and anger with me when I started a new game to complete the "No, you listen!" achievement in the tutorial level, only to then realise that the game had replaced my old save file. Given the simplicity of the game, a better saving system really wouldn't have been difficult to do. As a final note, gamers who aren't followers of the Nerd won't get the references (then again, would you really buy this game is you weren't a fan?). A great game, and very addictive.","October 13, 2014","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Personally, I'm more of an Irate Gamer fan (haters please don't spam me a bunch of hate), but since I still do in fact like the AVGN, I decided to check out the game. After playing it, I was amazed. The game takes inspiration from classics such as Mega Man and Castlevania. The graphics, music, nostalgic values, gameplay, humor and replay value were just remarkable. Even if you don't like the AVGN or his videos, I still recommend this game, because its a great stand alone game, even without the AVGN character. My only nitpick with the game is that there are only 10 levels, but the game resembles an NES game, so I'll let that slide. I see myself playing this game a lot in the future, and I won't regret it either. Now if we could only get the Irate Gamer game on Steam, then I would have a match made in Heaven. Thanks for reading this review. Check the game out and decide for yourself :)","July 15, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Any fan of AVGN will feel at home with all of the references and inside jokes that are packed into the game. The music is great, the graphics are fun (even with some reskinned images here and there), AVGN Adventures will put you into a fist clenching rage to finish.

After a few months I gave it another try (both this time and last time on Easy difficulty), and actually beat the game after I sat down and devoted a few hours to the game. Some parts you need to take a breath and gently pass by, and some parts you need to grab your balls and charge. Except on Laughin' Jokin' Numbnuts.

My only problems with the game are the uncreative death-blocks (I felt like these blocks could have been more creative or AVGN inspired) and that alot of the hidden cameos (such as Egoraptor), while they are cool, aren't really fitting. However, there ARE alot of cameoes and references to the show, such as the Nintoaster and the Glitch Gremlin. However, the best cameoes are the enemies you fight, such as the futuristic jellyfish, flying Medusa heads, Bimmy, defective NES robots, and the infamous "where did you learn to fly?" hologram.

A game much like   Megaman in gameplay and  difficulty. For the fans it will draw them in  with referrences and fan service. The  enemies won't  be much hassle , but the  deathboxes get to be frustrating at times ..which from time to time  just feel cheap.  All of the flaws with  the  game stem from the difficulty  with the  deathboxes, but when you finally succeed there is  payoff. The death screen is   always varied, but to me they got old fast. I'd rather had   them just  start me  further back instantly like No Time to  explain. Overall its fun and  worth the frustration.  Well worth the price for the 8 bit  megaman  feel. 8/10","June 11, 2014","true","18.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A spin-off made to p#@s you off. Story-The Nerd and his freinds get sucked into Game Land. Altough the story is basic, the humor  is amazing. Presintation-This game is a retro inspired platformer, but don't be fooled. The music and visuals are stunning. Gameplay-Inspired by Mega Man, this is a run 'n' gun platformer. You can unlock characthers like B.S Man, the now dead Guitar Guy and even Mike! You can get power-ups like Super Mecha Death Christ, Glitch Gremlin, a Super Scope and stones,but one thing I love in AVGN Adventures, It's fun and hard-Fard. So AVGN Adventures is a heck of a good time with a basic plot brilliant visuals, and Fard gameplay.

He's a really cool guy, so I try to support him in any way that I can. When I heard he had his own game, I jumped at the chance to get it.\n\nSimply put, this game is a blast. It's a tough as nails action platformer that perfectly captures the spirit of older gen titles. Kickin' music? Yes. Tight controls? Yes. Colorful, varied stages each with their own theme and challenges? Yes. A play experience that makes me feel like I spent my money well? Yes.\n\nIf you remember playing games like Contra, Journey to Silius, Mega  Man, and  Super Turrican, this game is for you. It's a simple premise: shoot and jump your way through each stage, all while collecting power ups and dodging an insane amount of obstacles. That's it. And it works. It's the high level of difficulty that makes this game so good though: a very balanced difficulty system allows players of all skill levels to get what they want from this game.\n\nAside from the great gameplay, this is also a fantastic low-brow homage to the games of yesteryear.

The only real downside is that the game is short and if you keep at it it can be beaten in a few hours, but it does have replay value if you want to try the harder settings. I recommend this game only if you are a fan of the AVGN series and enjoy NES style games. For the amount of content I'd recommend buy it while on sale, not at full price.","June 23, 2014","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Music is in 8-bit and in it's awesome glory. The game's graphics is all in classic 8-bit style that can reflect on the Mega Man games on the NES. The game has hidden cameos of other known internet celeberties and easter eggs. A lot of references reflected to the show. You even have the freedom of choosing which world you want to start off and complete in any order. It maintains the retro feel of playing a NES game that offers the challenge. Higher difficulties offer more challange to those who want to beat the game and make a name for themselves. Just like in past challenging games such as limited lives, removing the save feature, and the use of limited continues to replace the save feature if you plan to full play the game in the harder difficulties. So it has replayability.\n\nThe Bad: This game is hard to recomend if you're not a fan or never even heard of who the AVGN is. By playing the harder difficulties and the save feature turned off, you can't quit out the game and lose all your game progress. The game is short and can be finished in about 2 hours. The bosses feel somewhat repeatative and can be predictable when most of them move around the screen in a figure 8 pattern.\n\nI don't have a lot to say for this game. But the game will urge you to play it again time to time. You may have a lot of lives. But they will start to run out fast if you're not too careful. The game has to do with a lot of time and patience if you plan to get through it alive. If you try to speed run the game with no thought, you will die so fast before you can say game over. The hidden characters you find and play as can be useful sometimes to get from a point you can't reach, a hidden wall or passage, and help you out getting a few extra lives and power ups. Although you will be using The Nerd more than any other character when it comes to killing mostt to all enemies and bosses. The game maybe hard. But can make you come back just to beat the harder difficulties to prove you can beat them since the game is short, but sweet. The game recomends you get the full experience by playing it using a controler. The game is really unfriendly to those who use a keyboard. You can rebind the keys, but the jump timings can be hindered just by a bit when it comes to key timing. I don't recomend  buying this game at $15 full price. Wait for the game to go on sale. Still, it's a fun game not to pass up. A good game to play for yourself. But the game is much better when The Nerd plays it.

Time.\n\nIn conclussion: Pretty decent game, a must-have for an AVGN fan and a "You should try" for anyone who loves a good ol' hard platformer","June 22, 2014","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, despite having some really good aspects (music, styling,...), the game sadly resulted in being a precision/timing platformer, in which the smallest mistake will end up in an instant death. Unexpected and really fast moving hazards just end up in annoying trial & error and when there's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of stuff happening on your screen, it'll be more based on luck instead of skills that will help you get through it.\nThe game also doesn't reset your lives at the start of a new level, so if you have 8/30 lives left, you'll find yourself killing you over and over untill it's game over and the game givces you back 30 lives. Note that the easy setting has unlimited lives.\n\nIf you are a big fan of the series and you don't get frustrated fast, you might want to give this game a shot, as for all the others, there's just to much trial & error going on to be enjoyable (as it is not really a challange, but more of  course memorization).","January 10, 2014","false","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GabeNewellsFitnessInstructor/recommended/237740/","GabeNewellsFitnessInstructor","Clarky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GabeNewellsFitnessInstructor/","104 products in account","I intially went into this game with low expectations I have been dissapointed with licensed product before (having played a myriad of movie tie-in shovelware titles in my youth.) However I was very impressed with AVGN Adventures, a game that will appeal to both long-time fans of The Nerd and fans of hardcore retro platformers.\n\nThis title was released in 2013, developed by FreakZone Games and published by ScrewAttack. As shown by The Nerd in his episode "AVGN Games", games about The Nerd and his angry world have existed long before this game came out. Many of those titles were homebrew titles often created by one person and released on the Internet for free. AVGN Adventures is the first commercial AVGN game and certainly the title with the highest production value. Visually, the game features rich and colorful pixel art in additional to some smoothly animated effects (The Nerd exploding into several bits and pieces a la Fallout 3 is a highlight.) The soundtrack hearkens back to the video game days of yore, featuring an engrossing score that fits right at home with the games overall difficulty as well as sound effects that further  draw you in.\n\nThe gameplay is almost perfect for a game of this genre, it's hard but not unfair, and it's levels are fun and all vastly different from eachother. My only true gripe with the game is the finicky keyboard controls which unfortunately makes jumping and landing with precision challenging. This problem is of course erased when you plug in an Xbox 360 PC controller, however it does not erase the games overall difficulty. This game is not recommended for anyone who's not familiar with NES titles like Mega Man, Ninja Gaiden, and Castlevania as the difficulty of this game mimicks that of those classic titles. Also, the game doesn't have much replay value after you complete it for the first time which is acceptable for a $10 game but it would have been a nice feature to unlock additional levels or harder difficulty levels after you complete the game.\n\nIt's definitely worth your money if you like hard-as-nails, old-school platformers!","August 29, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For me so far, the game is very good (although I suck miserably at it...) and if you're a fan of The Nerd you're gonna find that the game is incredibly loyal to the series and it's very obvious that the developers put a lot of time into mashing in tributes to things said or done on the show.\n\nHowever, the game IS extremely hard, so take that into consideration before you buy it. I would not recommend paying more than ten bucks unless you're a really dedicated gamer. Also, I'm personally a huge fan of AVGN - But the jokes can be a little too much sometimes even for me - I'm mostly referring to the cursing on the death-screen, which isn't that funny in the show and just feels kinda forced in the game.\n\nEven if you're not a fan of The Nerd, or if you haven't watched AVGN, the game is a great homage to retro games and definitely worth playing.","December 7, 2013","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Tons of replay value, but not for younger gamers.\n\nStory - 4/10\nGameplay - 8/10\nDifficulty - 10/10\nVisual - 9/10\nAudio - 9/10\nReplay Value - 10/10\nFamily Friendly - 0/10\n\nIntroduction\nIf you dont know anything about the Angry Video Game Nerd, AVGN is a game review  web series where James Rolfe, the creator and star of the series, portrays an angry nerd who "Takes you back to the past" and plays terrible games from the NES, SEGA Genesis, and Atari ages of gaming. The reviews mainly point out flaws and mishaps with the selected games, and does so with the use of heavy profanity and poop jokes...A LOT of profanity.\nThe first line of the AVGN Theme song is\n"He's gonna take you back to the past\nTo play the sh*tty games that suck *ss"\nThe Nerd has reviewed  games, consoles, and even video game accessories throughout 100+ episodes.\n\nStory - 4/10\nThe intro cut scene tells the simple story this game has. The Nerd and his friends were playing a terrible game one night, and they were zapped into the game! The Nerd escapes to his basement, but he is quickly seized by a robot arm that comes out of the TV and pulls him in by his ball sack. You play as the Nerd and his friends trying to escape from Gameland.\nA pretty generic story. You are placed in a weird world, and you must escape. The reason that I gave the story a 4 and not lower, is because I can see this ridiculous thing happening in an episode of AVGN. Some of the more thematic episodes of the series involve the Nerd being chased by Jason Vorhees, fighting ROB the Robot, and even taking a dump on Bugs Bunny's face! Getting sucked into a video game sounds nothing out of the ordinary for the Nerd.\n\nGameplay - 8/10\nThis game is a platformer, but it offers some variety of gameplay. This game mainly consists of the player trying to get to the end of the level, but the difficulty is insane.\nIn the "normal" setting, you get three beers, which act as your health. along with 10 lives. The easiest setting gives you six beers with unlimited lives. Most enemies take off one beer, but there are insta-death blocks and lasers as well, in addition to the standard "fall of the screen" death.\nThere are eight different levels of Gameland to play in, each with a different theme based on an existing genre, including mid evil, sci-fi, winter, fantasy, and even a level based on the Atari porn games titled "Beat it and Eat it".\nEach level has different enemies and design, but they all have insta-death blocks, pits, and these annoying circular-flying enemies that are re-skins for each level. (In one level they are ghosts, in another, they are balls of electricity etc..)\n\nThe default Nerd is only armed with an NES baster gun as a weapon, but once found, the Nerd can get help from his friends who offer some special abilities. The other characters are also from the AVGN web series. While the game is able to be completed with just the Nerd, his friends come in handy at times.\nGuitar Guy can run faster and shoot through walls using his guitar.\nMother F*cker Mike can jump higher and longer, similar to Luigi, but his attack is a melee lightsaber. He cannot move while attacking. He can also see through walls, revealing lives, beers, and save points.\nThe B*llsh*t Man can throw turds at enemies, but only at a short distance. However, he can double jump by farting, which allows access to previously unreachable areas.\n\nThere are also special attacks that can be picked up throughout the game, including the Glitch Gremlin, who “glitches out” every enemy on screen, making them easier to kill. The Super-Mecha-Death-Christ powerup kills all enemies on screen. There is also a joke “rock” powerup. You can throw them at enemies, but the rocks arc over everything, which is useless, but is used in various real games the Nerd has reviewed.\n\nDifficulty – 10/10\nI have only beaten this game on the easy mode. With six beers and unlimited lives, it was still difficult. Literally everything in this game is trying to kill you. There are walking enemies, flying enemies, enemies that float in patterns, lasers, disappearing blocks, insta-death blocks, disappearing insta-death blocks, and more. I cannot fathom how anybody can beat this game above the normal setting.\n\nVisual - 9/10\nThe graphics in this game are superb. It really captures the style of the old-school NES. The animations are spot-on, and the color schemes of the levels are outstanding. There isnt much I can say about it without showing you the game itself.\n\nAudio – 9/10\nMuch like the visuals, I can't really give the audio justice without you actually hearing it. The music in this game is phenomenal. Each track is memorable and fits the mood of the game that you're in. The title screen is a chip tune version of the AVGN theme, the level select screen gets enhanced after unlocking the final level, each level track is amazing for a minute long loop. I don't know what else to say except for you to listen for yourself!\n\nReplay Value – 10/10\nThere is tons of replay value in this game. After discovering the other three characters, you can go back and find all of the hidden Sh*tpickles (another character from AVGN). They don't do anything besides you get an achievement for finding them all. After beating the game on easy, you can refine your skills in Normal, Old School, and the other advanced settings where the beers and lives become fewer, and the enemies become harder to kill.\n\nFamily Friendly – 0/10\nAs you have probably noticed from the names of the characters, this game is not for children. The nerd curses (all through text boxes) during different levels, character reveals, and sections of the game. Each time you die, the death screen shows a randomly generated phrase “I'd rather X X from a X's X than play this X game!” one of the less profane ones ive gotten was “I'd rather chew urine from a potato's butt crack then play this crummy game!”The Nerd flips you the bird if you leave him idling for too long, and when you start up the game, the first thing you see is “RATED 'F' FOR F*CKBALLS”\nThe worst part, is that there is no way to filter out these obscene things. I'm afraid to play this game in around my family because of all the profanity in this game. Sure, the AVGN series is filled with it, so I guess it fits to have it in the game, but I was shocked when I first played it. There was no warning or disclaimer telling me of this on the Steam store page. If you are heavily offended by profanity, do not pick up this game.\n\nSo there you have it! My review of Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures. Overall, it's a good game. It can be difficult most of the time, but what it lacks in easiness, it makes up for in audio and art style. I say that it's listed on Steam at a fair price.","December 23, 2013","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is full of cheap kills and vulgar language via this "Nerd" character who is nothing more than a cheap megaman knockoff who proceeds to whine about every single thing this stupid game has to offer. There are not very many levels and all of them are crafted with the level design equivalent of something an 11 year old boy drew on a piece of paper when he was supposed to be paying attention to math class. Tons of one-hit kill blocks muck up what could have at least been a mediocre yet fun little romp through the somewhat clever parody levels of other much better games. But that's it there are only 6 or 7 levels! That's HALF of one megaman game. Also this nerd is not your only character you play as. He has friends - go figure - a nerd with friends! Doesn't seem very nerdy if you A) have friends and B) have a cool gun that you fire at everything. That's what cool people have! In fact the only thing nerdy about this stereotype is that hes got glasses and whines!\n\nThe other characters all suck and do not help you out in any way and the collectible "♥♥♥♥ pickles" add nothing to the game. There is no reason to collect anything in this game unless you are really so bored that you'd want to play this atrocity again. Oh, and despite the pretty colors and simple gameplay, this game is NOT for kids. Heck I don't think its for adults either as the humor is an uncanny blend of juvenile and adult (see: "♥♥♥♥ Pickle"). This is a game that I can only reccomend for sick twisted minds of 20-something stoners and drunks who want something stupid to laugh at for about 30 minutes before getting tired of dying and need to go play GTA while they get high and blow up cars and run people over.\n\nDepraved, dawdling and unfunny.

If you already enjoy The Angry Video Game Nerd and his humor you will definitely love this game.","December 21, 2013","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It uses a lot of jokes that James has made in his game reviews along with his potty mouth lol. Be warned though, this game is HARD AS BALLS!!!! I'm playing with a 360 controller on "Old School" mode. Holy ♥♥♥♥balls is it difficult. I did get to the final world, but got my ♥♥♥ kicked. Oh well, I'll try again later.....","December 22, 2013","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are smooth as butter, the humor is spot-on to the AVGN's style, and the level design is excellent. Each stage feels just difficult enough to keep you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, but not enough that you just up and rage-quit... for the most part. Any avid fan of AVGN will recognize all of the things that makes the web show great, but where it truly shines are the cameos. Many different cameos show up in hidden rooms, including AVGN's friends and companions, as well as ScrewAttack celebrities and various other web personalities. Even if you don't recognize them all, it's still fun to find them. It's gut-wrenchingly difficult, but investing enough time in this game is well worth it. There's a great charm to be had in playing this game.","December 23, 2013","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
