Longpong","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dermtz/","1584 products in account","I've played the best part of an hour and thought I would leave my initial impressions.\n\nGreat music. I love it. It's a bit of a mix of the old school chiptune vibe with a twist of the contemporary.\n\nIt doesn't have the option to rebind keys but the default is a fairly common WASD setup. The native xbox controller support works like a charm and it makes use of the analogue sticks with progressive flight controls(push it a little to fly slowly, push it a lot to fly fast) so I would say a controller is the way forward.\n\nIf you've played a roguelike before you'll be familiar with the ?? pick ups. Instead of potions and scrolls you get alien artifacts and alien technology. They come in usual buff and debuff flavours but are all themed to fit into the world. Blindness/confusion potion becomes a Sensor Disrupting artifact etc. After you've use a ?? mystery pick up once, it's identified and the next time you get it, you'll know when to use it or if you just want to jettison it right away.\n\nThere's no XP system but there is equipment to loot, which is all procedurally generated a la Borderlands, which is great. I found a couple of different shields, one had a higher total capacity but slower regeneration, a low capacity shield with very fast regen and I found a few ship accessories. One boosted fire rate at the cost of shield regen and the other allowed me to regenerate armour.\n\nThe other way your ship progresses is through upgrade parts. They are like skill points you can find and then you can choose to add another weapon slot, the only gun I found on my run boosted my front fire rate a fair bit but also had a rear fire which was great or  you can increase your hull/cargo capacity and thrusters.\n\nThe "overworld" isn't too dissimilar to the FTL star chart. You move from left to right and you can branch off now and then taking a longer route to the goal to go hunting for loot and upgrades. While you are in the overworld aka space you can identify your mystery parts and potions.. I mean artifacts and you use your upgrade parts. The UI is simple but effective and very easy to work with.\n\nWhen you are done messing around in space you pick the planet on the star map and get down to business. I think I seen 4 different kinds of planet. Desolate, Ice, Forest and Water. There are some cool environmental effects like a Sandstorm type deal that blows in from the left or right and slows or speeds you up depending on which direction you are going. On the Ice planet I noticed a nice little fogging/frosting effect at the edges of the screen, while on the jungle planet I think I was attacked by some sort of space locusts.\n\nIt's really not as punishing as most games with roguelike elements. I was reduced to zero Hull(that's after 0 shield and 0 armour) a few times and was allowed to carry on but my equipment degraded. Shields regenerated at half speed, my gun lost x amount of power. So while you pay a bit of a price, there is enough loot that at least a placeholder item wont be far away. You can save and quit anytime, too. That's always good.\n\nAnyway, this is just supposed to be a bit of a rambling first impression seeing as there were no reviews at all when I got it. So far I really like it. I should add that the little writing I got to experience was well done.\n\n\n","May 16, 2015","true","7.2"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

Or maybe downloaded off of Jumbo Games or the like. It's the kind of game you sit down to play for an hour. Then come back the next day and play again. It's got that subtle addictive quality. It's a very good blend of easy, approachable, and challenging. Almost feels like an obscure game Apogee might have made back in the day. Every time I've played it I've experienced new enemies, upgrades, and obstacles.\n\nI love that I can collect items to unlock new ships, and these ships recieve completely different effects from the artifact/potion pickups. Each ship is a totally different game.\n\nMy only complaint is that in the very late levels I keep dying from being rammed, despite whatever collision damage reducing modifiers I've equipped. Even in the speediest ship, which I transitioned to by a chance powerup, later levels feature so many spawning enemies intent on ramming you that it presents a huge challenge. But of course, this a rogue-like, and daunting challenge is to be expected.\n\nStill, I wish there was a cloaking device with a timed cooldown cycle that when activated would prevent me from picking up anything or firing, but would hide me from the enemies. This would allow me to better tip toe around the later levels and cloak & heal when resistance gets too tough. Ballancing this, most upgrades are only found by shooting enemies, and some fuel has to be obtained from mini boss battles. For all I know this upgrade is already in the game and I haven't found it yet, that's how much neat upgrade loot is in this game.\n\nIf you like the idea of an action rogue-like with a sort of Fort Apokalypse meets Defender vibe, definitely check this out.","May 21, 2015","true","7.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

It's great for a quick run, but also has that addictive "one more try" factor. There's good variety in the environments and random loot. Seems well balanced. The music is great, but a few more tracks would be nice. A controller is definitely the best way to play this.

The planetary action reminds me strongly of Solar Jetman (NES), but the worlds seem to be made from scratch each time, so each one is always a new experience on dropping out of orbit.    There are several different sorts of worlds, each with its own hazards that only get worse as one progresses along the path to solving the mystery.     A wealth of powerups (and power-downs, some pretty severe) make each playthrough a real adventure.\n\nIt's basically a sometimes very tough free-scrolling shmup with roguelike elements.   Some acquisitions are "Collection" items that affect all future playthroughs.  The music is pretty sweet, and the sound effects are distinctive for each enemy and its fire.\n\n(This bit here contained a complaint about the "Teleporting Eyeball" enemy being hard to notice and showing up too close to the player's ship to avoid, sometimes, but the developer has addressed both those concerns on this first day of 2016, and made a previously somewhat cumbersome equipment system a bunch easier to use, to boot.)\n\ntl;dr:  GET THIS if you like solidly-done blasty gameplay and getting cool (and uncool)  items, with a nice bit of story on the side, and lovely music all around.","December 27, 2015","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Kinda has the feel of an updated Asteroids and/or Defender. But with better control and procedurally generated gameplay elements. Overall map, level map layout and visual, and items names are generated. Item effects and enemies are randomly selected. Visual issues with the game are now gone (headache mode is gone, thanks Ben!).\n\n\nPros:\n• Pyoo pyoo.\n• Procedurally generated maps.\n• Random loot.\n• o y am i ded again.\n• Very responsive developer. I reported three issues. Three issues were fixed. Quickly even. Got a personal response, too. And this, while other features and fixes are getting pushed out too.\n\nCons:\n• ???","June 14, 2015","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","5"

It's easy to miss things that happen onscreen because things are so tiny.\nAt first I got really aggrevated by the force fields and couldn't tell why I was losing damange.  The graphics are really subpar and there are much better rogue likes with similar themes.  I don't really feel immersed in the game like I do with other roguelikes and this is probably because of the low budget graphics and sound.","July 25, 2015","false","0.9"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

With this game I felt like it was entirely up to chance.  Maybe after youve found all the mystery pick ups its easier but I don't like having to die this much just to learn how to play the game.","August 7, 2015","false","0.6"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","2","8","2","0"

I have played many rogue-likes and I found this one on the easy side which is okay. This game is in the style of Defender(Atari) and Aqua Kitty.  The music and atmosphere is the standout. The different planets could stand out more by having different monster sets.\n\nFor the price i recomend it.\n\nI am looking forward to giving co-op a try.","May 28","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
