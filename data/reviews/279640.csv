It's from Troma.\n\n"WHO THE HELL IS TROMA?" you might ask yourself.\n\nTROMA Entertainment.\nThe purveryors of crazy, zany, sick, twisted, hardcore, grindhouse, action/scifi/horror/romance cult movies in the universe of B-movies. That's who. They even had a Saturday morning cartoon show at one point. Their fame stems mostly from the movie: "The Toxic Avenger", a fugly, but "lovable good guy superhero mutant", and an assort of other movies, with other characters that have developed large cult followings. They've been around for about 40 years now.\n\nSO now these guys have a PC game. ACTUALLY, about 15 years ago; said they didn't release it then, figuring the game would get totally banned.\n\n*Update: "DrSpikee" shared this was originally a 1999 Polish game called "Rezerwowe Psy"*.\nThanks dude! :D\nIt appears Troma was able to use it to make their own game. (seems minus the original sex/nudity!)\n\nTHE GAME:\nStarts with a disclaimer; and Lloyd from Troma pointing out you don't need it: you already bought the effing game! LOL, NICE! :D\nThen, a "Troma" intro, a collection of clips from their many old movies: gross, gory, hardcore grindhouse, with boobs in one scene (more on boobs later). There's the menu, pretty straightforward. Start a New Game.\n\nThe game is an isometric, tactical, turn-based, squad-based shooter.\nYou start out with 3 dudes: The Toxic Avenger (Toxie), Sgt.Kabukiman, and The Stranger.\nYour goal: to wipe out the Surf Nazis (see the movie "Surf Nazis Must Die").\n\nThe game is very similar in handling to the original Fallout game, but with complete emphasis on COMBAT only. Even the inventory menu looks inspired, so fans of Fallout 1/2, will find some familiarity. When you bag someone, they die, leave a bloody mess, and their loot in a nice pile for you to pick-up through the inventory screen.\n\nEverything costs action points. Action points to walk, action points to shoot, action points to reload, to move things in your inventory even.\n\nThe game is divided into "missions". The level areas aren't big, this is not an RPG, this is a pretty straightforward clean and sweep game: GO AND KILL ALL OF THE BAD GUYS.\n\nFrom this point, that is all you do. There isn't anything to interact with, but you can blow away all the different pedestrians with names with the likes of:  "Hooker", "Freak", "Fat Guy", "Crazy With A Shotgun", etc. Some will randomly draw weapons and shoot you. Shooting a "overworked office worker" might yield you some loot, like booze, drugs, money, a mobile phone, a porn mag, or whatever. Most of the loot appears to be just "novelty" items. The only things of value are any weapons/ammo they have. Like Fallout 1/2, you can waste ANYONE,  but there is no "karma" penalty in this game.\n\nYou can also target individual parts: legs, torso, or head. Just right cilck on the target to get a small menu with attack options. Works well.\nHowever, it doesn't seem to really do anything. For example, you can't blow off legs or heads.\nHaven't seen any animations other than the character falling to the ground, and then a pool of blood appearing. I noticed when I shot someone with alot of strength still, in the head, they died immediately.Other times, I aimed for the head, and they were just lightly wounded.\n\nI suspect this is probably something they never had time (or budget) to finish or properly implement.\n\nTo complete the missions, you only have to snuff out the BAD GUYS (with various weapons).\nOnce that is done, there is a "Thumbs Up" button that appears.\nClick it, and you are done.\n\nBetween missions, you are treated to the narrator telling the story.\nLOL. Man this is so bad. Sometimes, you will see a random, non-sequiter video clip. One, shows the creators of South Park in a fake commercial about hermaphrodites. Another, of Lemmy from Motorhead doing a weird PSA type thing. Another is a metal music video. Another is a montage of super-gory moments from Troma movies.\n\n(**NOTE, you will miss these if you "left-click". I tried "right-clicking" and then they played. However, the game glitched-out when the next level started.)\n\nGraphics:\nNot bad for a game 15 years old. There isn't anything to interact with, there isn't a load of detail in the hand-painted backgrounds/levels, but the areas are diverse and seem to look better as you progress. The animations were good.\n\nSound:\nThe sound FX are alright, a couple times, they didn't play, but was rare and only in an instant.\nA couple of sounds, seem to be right out of Fallout, like when reloading or messing with the menu. Hmmm. When you kill someone, they let out a really long, over-the-top blood-curdling scream. The characters/NPCs will make funny comments or noises at times. Like, Toxie might run out of action points while trying to go somewhere you told him to, and will stop and say something like:"Yeah, I'll get to it as soon as I finish taking my toxic waste dump!"\n\nMusic: Varies, from PORNO music, to alot of  SKA and METAL, with R or X rated lyrics. It's like they couldn't afford GWAR and got some other bands who weren't as extreme. The narrator might pop-in once in a while to give a game hint. Whatever.\n\nPROS:\n-Straight-forward, old-school Turn-based Squad Action\n-Good bloody, dark humor\n-Interface design is simple and efficient at the same time\n-Novelty of playing classic cult characters from the TROMA movies and fighting other characters from the movies\n-If you like games like POSTAL, you'll feel right at home\n-Great music\n-the game proudly doesn't take itself seriously\n-Tons of bonus features, including old CD-ROM style Macromedia player interface (will be in your Steam folder), where you get a bunch of "behind-the-scenes" stuff. A lot of blood, boobs, and booty. There is a whole section of the "Tromettes", hot, naked/scantly-dressed chicks in sexy or PORN-Y poses.\n\nCONS:\n-Seems like you never get enough action points to do things\n-Some lite-RPG elements would have been nice\n-Inventory system is glitchy as heck!!!! I recommend when clicking an inventory/ground object, to click REAL FAST (tap) and do this in the upper-left corner of the object. Glitchy inventory system can cause you to easily pick-up/put-down an object costing you valuable Action points\n-How managing your inventory is never explained well. For example, took awhile to figure out character's "backpacks" can hold seemingly infinite amount of items!!\n-For a "Troma" game, it greatly lacks the gore; it feels dare I say: unfinished? Fallout, Arcanum, Postal, and just many others games even from that time, were bloodier, gorier. So this was a disappointment.\n-Sometimes, you'll spend TOO MUCH time hunting for that ONE LAST ENEMY on the map\n-Game mouse-scroll is way too fast and there is no way to use the keys or to slow it down\n-Wished the world was more detailed and fleshed out\n-Rough around some edges\n\nMAYBE:\n-Permadeath! If one of your first 3 guys gets wasted, they're OUT.\nYou advance into the next missions with whoever survived. OR, if you can reload from your last saved (you can save whenever)\nSome people will like this, some will not. So far with my game, I got a hot chick added in one mission.\n-Doesn't seem to be anyway to restore health during a mission, so might be too challenging for some.\n-Sick, Troma style humor isn't for everyone (gosh, maybe anyone, LOL)\n\nOVERALL:\nRemember, it's not an RPG or even some big epic game.\nAND DON'T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY!\nYou go out and kill the bad guys (and whoever else). That's it.\nIt would be interesting if they make a new game where they implement more things to do, more gore, more interaction, etc.\nSome will FAP to the (mostly partial) nudity in the game (or tons in the bonus features), others might FAP to the silly, ridiculous violence.\nIf you're a TROMA fan, you'll probably FAP to all of it.","October 30, 2015","true","1.9"," 52 of 55 people (95%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","95","52","55","6","8"

If not, pass on this.\nCan you stand or do you enjoy the gameplay of the Fallout and/or Crusader games? If not, pass on this.\nCan you forgive a game for being obviously made around 1999 and for having numerous glaring faults? If not, pass on this.\n\nFor everyone else, this is truly the gaming equivalent of a Troma movie, narrated by Lloyd himself and featuring music and clips pulled from Troma's vast library. This is so not a game for everyone, but really would it be a true Troma game if it was?\n\nMy main gripes: It feels overly difficult. Combat's clunky, and the gameplay can be really non-intuitive, especially menu interaction and item interaction.\n\nBeyond that... I feel I got what I'd expect from a game from one of my favorite film companies.","October 30, 2015","true","0.5"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","17","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HitGod47/recommended/279640/","HitGod47","HitGod47","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HitGod47/","791 products in account","Growing up I became quite familiar with Troma movies. Our trips to the video store would often end with one of us bringing home "Class of Nuke 'Em High" or "The Toxic Avenger", or another oddball Troma film. The AAA movies were usually picked over (this was before a dozen copies of the same movie existed at one place) and nobody wanted the piece of ♥♥♥♥ Troma movies that were always lurking in the horror section. They were cheap, easy-to-find, and they horrified clean-cut tight-♥♥♥ ultra-orthodox families. In other words: these movies were made for degenerates like me.\n\nThe best way to describe a Troma movie is by imagining a steaming turd left to sautee in a vat of brown toilet water in a public restroom and occasionally puked on for a month. After that they take it out with a pair of pincers and dip it in fondue, then sprinkle it with confetti and truffle oil. It's Trash folks. But it's gold-encrusted trash made by sick-minded filmmakers for trash-loving fans; and when you grow up with that kind of art you learn to appreciate it like a fine French wine.\n\nLloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz really tapped into something original when they started making these movies. I mean how do you categorize a film that has a handicapped kid getting slaughtered for points or a buxom beauty getting her butt burned by a mutated monster? A buffet of violence complimented by rock 'n roll music and sexual humor? This is the wonderful world of Tromaville and it is clearly a genre of its own.\n\nThe video game is your basic RTS without the advanced tactics stuff. Honestly I could only stomach a short play. But its full of violence, foul language, pictures of naked women, and classic Troma songs (which can also be found as MP3s in the root folder). So what am I complaining about?","December 17, 2015","true","1.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","100","8","8","6","0"

I like both so I enjoy this one. If you are not a fan of turned based games and or the Troma movies, then this game isn't for you.\n\nI only played the first two missions so far, but it is fun. Control Toxie, Sargent Kabukiman and a new character the stranger and show why Surf Nazis musst die!\n\nLoyd Kaufmans narration is great, and the soundtrack is nice too (It consists of the soundtracks of the movies, and various metal and punk music, very fitting and fun to listen too, again if you enjoy that type of music). There is also plenty of Troma movie clips. Again highly recommended if you like turned based tactics like X-Com/Fallout/Jagged Alliance and if you like Troma.","December 6, 2015","true","1.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

If you are a fan of the Troma films and are looking for a good nostalgia trip, I'd highly reccomend this game.
