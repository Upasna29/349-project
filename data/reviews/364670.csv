"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dzumeister/recommended/364670/","Dzumeister","zooboo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dzumeister/","308 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSkyflower is an Early Access arcade shooter with roguelike elements. You traverse through procedurally generated dungeons while shooting at enemies and collecting powerups. Unfortunately, there's not much to it.\n\nGranted, the game is in Early Access, but it looks (and feels) like it's the developer's first game. Much of the game is unbalanced, especially in the enemy projectile patterns and character skillsets. The artwork is all pixelated, but it lacks the charm and polish of other games in its genre. Furthermore, the developer doesn't seem to be too invested in updating the game.\n\nTo be fair, for $3, it seems like the kind of game you would expect at its price. However, you'd be better off playing the multitude of other arcade shooters on Steam. Vintage Year, for instance, is more polished and interesting, and is only a couple dollars more. Nuclear Throne is still the best in its class, even though it's also in Early Access. Those are just a couple examples of purchases more worth your money.","September 20, 2015","false","0.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

Still find it fun, but not playable beyond NG.\n\nFun twin stick shooter that is entertaining, if yet incomplete. The controls are pretty tight, and the initial slow movement of the characters is offset by some of the items' effects. I'd say "think of this as a stripped-down and still in early development Nuclear Throne," but they seem to fill different niches, at least to me.\n\nThere are some ui and graphical issues, like the lightning effects not leaving the screen in some cases, or the player character and some static objects changing size (very minimally, perhaps because of how they are rendered?) when moving the cursor while standing still or moving slowly. The main menu and in-game pause menu need to be worked over (as the dev has said he plans to do in the next update).\n\nOverall, I feel it's definitely worth the money (whether full price or on sale) to pick this up.","December 2, 2015","false","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Dev seems to have abandoned it. Don't waste your money on this.\n-----\nOriginal review:\n-----\nAt the time of writing it's already a fun game, but it's still very early in it's development and needs a lot of work. The multi-player for example will notify you that it will likely crash. So keep that in mind if you're considering purchase. I'd still recommend it though, especially since it's cheap.\n\nOh and, no doubt this will get patched soon, but right now, hold O to get all the items in the game.

This doesn't mean it's bad, though it does seem like a possible Unity asset flip (I don't know personally if it is or not). It's got plenty of pretty colors as well, three different classes categorized by their special attacks, and a score that is catchy at times, but also can be barren or non-existent. Hopefully the audio is just due to being early access 1.1.\n\nI have no idea if some of the things I think are glitches are meant to be there though. There's no options menu or anything that explains the controls over than a quick explanation on WASD and how the mouse works in the game. I hit O and P at times, and random things happened, as if I were using special items, not to mention sometimes hitting Z or T and teleporting to the next level.\n\nIt has potential, and I'm anxious to see further builds. I don't regret the purchase and suggest it while it's on sale if this is your kind of thing.\n\n","June 25, 2015","true","0.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

We have enough with huge teams of devs rushing their games to release in order to make money as quick as they can. We don't need that practice to be encouraged.\n\nWhat we have here is a pretty decent game with absolutely game breaking design choices and bugs.\n\nThe first design choice that is extremely bad is after each boss, the weapon choices pop up...during the stage. You are being shot at while you must choose a weapon. How can one even make that choice? It's idiotic.\n\nAnother is stunlocking. If you get surrounded by enemies, you're stuck. And that's easy to do since enemies can spawn all around you. You become stuck and take tons of damage.\n\nThere are also sniper enemies that are virtually impossible to dodge. I got killed the moment I entered a stage just now. And at this point, the game mocks you which further proves how young the dev is and that this game was made to just mock us all and the industry as a whole.\n\nEach character has a power. One is a spread weapon which is pretty alright and has multiple variants that spray bullets all over the screen or in a more concentrated beam. Another is a shield that lasts for 0.01 seconds. It's useless. What's balance? If I chose the shied, I probably wouldn't get anywhere. I definitely would not be able to destroy the purple whatever since it's too far for the regular attack unless I wanted to get killed and only slightly hurt it.\n\nFor the bugs, we have the above and a few more. There are healing points scattered throughout that do absolutely nothing at all. Then there are little red orbs of some kind that do absolutely nothing.\n\nWe need to be able to report these games for all of the above. A quick look into the forum revealed that the dev is probably very young and not at all feeling inclined to keep working on the game, despite being paid. He claimed to release an update in one week. That was months ago and nothing happened. Finally, he responded and said that school is in the way. Put down that common core garbage and get to work. You've sold a product now and it's your job to make sure that product isn't a broken mess.\n\n(also, the description claims that you can solve puzzles. There isn't a single puzzle. False advertisement is also funny.)","January 12","false","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cakes1/recommended/364670/","cakes1","ʕგҚვֆ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cakes1/","1174 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst Hour ImpressionsSo I like to play the first hour of Early Access games and keep (rather pessimistic) notes about my experience: what I'm thinking, what I have a problem with and what I enjoy. I'm posting these notes for the developer to see to hopefully give them a good idea of how a completely new, unbiased player experiences their game for the first time. So this is mostly for the developer but if you're looking to try this game out, feel free to read through my notes. Warning: this will most likely get lengthy.\n\n\nGameplay NotesI know it's Early Access, but basic options would've been nice (like a music mute so I can play my own)\nThrows you right into it with no mumbo-jumbo, good\nThe teleport should prompt the player perhaps, so they don't just leave tons of money/whatnot on the ground and leave the level prematurely on accident: I had no idea what the teleporter did, maybe a quick hint?\nTeleporters are a bit random actually, I just hit one right after starting a level and it just teleported me to a different one in a random spot, what's going on?\nSort of slow-paced for a bullet-hell, at least movement-wise\nNo clue what this cross statue does or is, no clue what this red ball trophy does or is, no clue what this ethereal floating gray ball does or is, a TINY bit of explanation would be nice (alright, the ball hurts me, but how do I interact with the statue/trophy??)\nInstead of SHIFT being a walk function, shouldn't it be a sprint? This is a bullet-hell\nI guess there's something good about just learning as you play, but asking me to purchase items I know nothing about is a bit far, guess I'll just have to gamble...\nToo easy\nFirst boss WAY too easy\nNice progression in introducing new enemies, still don't know how the level progression works though\nItems feel kind of like Risk of Rain-style, I like them\nAlright, difficult isn't too easy, it's too spiky, first playthrough was easy as hell, second was insanely difficult, it should be balanced a bit more delicately\nHINT TO NEW PLAYERS: The shield spell blocks one hit, it is NOT time-based\nI'm having a lot of fun now, but I fear this will get very dull and repetitive quickly... There really isn't much variety at all\nGame is way too easy now, get one lucky upgrade and you win\nSome enemy designs are creative while others are just downright random or unfitting\nWait, I lost a key by going to the next level??? But not every level has a locked door, nor does every level that has a locked door have a key. Or at least I thought?\n"Chance of Lightning" item is a bit OP, the range is insane and it hits so hard\nMaybe bullets are too bit or the range of attacks is too far, but I barely get to see any enemies, they're all dead by the time I get within range, and I would just stop shooting from so far out but their bullets are so big I can't approach until I blind shot in their direction until they're dead\nThere should be more variety in the main character's weapon\nI'm assuming levels are randomly generated, if so the generator needs a bit of work, I've been put in some poorly-designed levels, as well as downright boring ones\nIs it just, or is there no way to approach the lady boss who shoots the rotating lines of green bullets? No matter what I do I can't approach without getting hit\n\nAesthetic NotesVery pretty and sleek, easy on the eyes\nShiny, glowing, very lovely art style but nothing too unique; this pixel style's been done many times in the recent past\nDeath animations are cool\nCool way to show the character die as well\nMusic is fitting, but could be better\nThe screen shake during combat is very well done and makes the game feel intense\nMusic is now unfitting, very calm while game is hectic and violent\nSound effects in general work, I like them\nSpikes a bit hard to notice, they don't look like something that would cause damage or even have a relevance: they blend in and move so slowly\nWhy do health packs sound like they're hurting you? The screen even shakes like they caused damage\nThe actual artistic ability demonstrated is rather low, however\n\nTechnical NotesMusic splice when transferring levels is off-putting\nThe perks are cool, but the boxes should pause the game, enemies could shoot at me while I was trying to decide which one to get\nGame uses my special ability if I minimize it, click on something else, and go back to game (???) (I think it may have been one of the buttons I pushed to minimize the window, it's probably a special ability hotkey)\nBUG: The game froze and crashed after I entered the first portal after the first boss\nBUG: When I use my special ability "bullet wave" while up against a wall, even if I'm facing away from it the bullets all hit the wall and dissappear\nYou can get the enemy who charges you easily stuck on the wall making it a 100% safe fight\nBUG: If you brush against walls sometimes you get stuck on them even if they're flat\nUm, the shield power-up didn't work. I RMB, got a shield, walked through a bullet immediately, and it killed me, just one bullet, not two\nThe menu doesn't even have an exit button?!\nGame desperately needs the bare minimum before it should be made any more complex or be given any more body\nThe balancing is absolutely broken\n\nConclusion: Overall, Skyflower is pretty fun, but very repetitive and won't be able to be played for long amounts of time. It's one of those games you play to fill up a few minutes of free time, not something you really get into and try to progress in, because it's frankly too dull for that. I do recommend it, however, since it has a very fair pricetag, and can be quite enjoyable if you just mindlessly wanna  shoot things. It's main flaw is the balancing: the difficulty goes all over the place, the abilities aren't balanced, items can be downright OP or useless: it needs a lot of basic playtesting and foundation before it'll be better than DECENT.\n\n\nTo Developer: If you ever release a large patch and/or change some mechanics or big parts of the game, or simply just want some playtesting for bugs, feel free to contact me for further testing and input!","January 4","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
