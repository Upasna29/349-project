Available now with overpowered Gehaburn DLC!\nFor those who are new with the series and worries about having to play the first one or not, I can assure you it is just fine to jump straight here, as this one is on diffrent "Dimension" from the first game, unless you're big fan of Neptune, then GO GET IT. You can never have enough Nep.\n\nHere's why, the first game explains more about Neptune and her party, this one will be focusing the story with CPU Candidates, with Neptune's little sister, Nepgear as the protagonist!\n\nAs for Neptune and her goddesses-mate, they will be... unavailable for a while.\n\nGameplay wise, it's mainly have pretty much similar gameplay to R;B1, but this time you got 4 party members to battle with rather than 3!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zhulov3rz/recommended/351710/","zhulov3rz","zhulov3rz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zhulov3rz/","29 products in account","I thought this game was relatively average until now. (Average is different from bad!)\nThen there was conquest ending, and the game went from average, to absolute masterpiece.\nI fully recommend this title for that ending alone. Truly an experience unlike any other.\n\nDisclaimer: Conquest ending may not be suitable for the faint of heart. It may cost you a night's sleep, or your dignity, or your manliness, or whatever. Consult your doctor to see if conquest is suitable for you.\n\n\nSUPER Lengthy version to sell you on Conquest End:\nI'm going to great lengths to sound as ambiguous as possible and avoid spoilers. So if it sounds weird and the phrasing is strange, it's likely intentional. Or me being stupid.\n\nI felt like for the most part the game was playing out like a standard JRPG, gather a party, go beat up a bad guy and save the day for the most part. Which made it average, but not great (mostly due to the large amount of AAA games that already use this formula over and over). The interesting character to character interactions and quips felt like they were cut in favour of the darker overtone and the story focus.\n\nThis brings us to the subject of the conquest ending. The darkest and edgiest of endings in a darker and edgier sequel.\nSo in conquest, the world once again needs saving, but now there's a great cost that one must pay to save the world. In most games, this generally means the thousands of faceless enemy mook that you killed to get there, or whatever. Not this time. A hefty price must be paid, as the characters are put in a situation where there are no winners. One of them must walk the path and suffer a fate worse than death. This is the incredible weight of emotional baggage involved in this tear-jerking emotional experience. The guilt from walking the path just to prevent the end of the world. Due to the setting, it tells a tale of a highly relatable, but painfully tragic story. (This is probably the reason why it's also regarded as the most traumatic ending. Its simply our reaction to knowing that you never want to be put in a position like that ever in real life.)\n\nConquest is essentially a downer ending. But a very well executed one. Frequently there are shows, movies or stories with downer endings that just feel like a cheap cliffhanger or a "and then everyone died the end". Conquest sets itself apart by being different. There's resolution, but is it the one you expect? There's peace to the world at last, but will it hold? The world was saved, but does the end justify the means to do it? The beauty of the writing slowly opens up to you the further you get.\n\nConquest is though invoking. It makes you really think about the things we often take for granted or simply take at face value. What is saving the world? How tangible is saving the world? Does the world matter enough for you to go to ANY length to save it? Would you rather let the world end and enjoy the remainder of it with your friends? Why did you choose this path for the world? To prevent others from doing it? Or to ensure your own survival? Who's the real villian here? If you've lost everything you hold dear, does saving the world even matter anymore? The boundaries of gray morality and ethics are pushed in this ending to further make us question what's really going on.\n\nConquest is a masterpiece, a work of art, and a gaming experience like no other. It has changed my opinion on this game, and has shown that is far from mediocre. For an excellent game ending that's different and puches you hard in the gut, you simply have to experience the conquest ending of HDN:RB2.\n\n(Disclaimer: There are many games that are similar in certain, highly specific ways, and or may be better in some aspects. Your mileage will vary, discretion advised.)","July 12, 2015","true","75.9"," 85 of 88 people (97%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","97","85","88","23","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/psiwindftw/recommended/351710/","psiwindftw","PSI Wind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/psiwindftw/","141 products in account","Well, the second Neptunia game for PC has finally been released. And, as IFI's second PC port, I think they did a better job in terms of basics like optimization and even graphics.\n\nHyperdimension Neptunia Re;birth 2 is, much like Re;birth 1, a remake of the second game in the series, Mk2. Normally, RPGs nowadays require a run of the first game to understand some of the plot details without spoiling the first game, but because the first game for the PS3 was so bad, IF and CH decided to reboot the entire series, so Mk2/Re;birth 2 is actually the first canonical game in the franchise.\n\nGameplay:\n\nIf you're familiar with the first Re;birth game, you'll feel right at home with the standard battle mechanics. You first do a basic attack, and then have up to 3 extra attacks with varying mechanics on their own. You have Rush, which deals multiple hits and is helpful for increasing your EXE Drive. Power is the heavy hitters of your standard attacks, and Break deals tons of damage to your Enemies Guard bar. When an enemies guard is broken (A Guard Break), they take more damage until your turns are up and they attack again. Partners still give you special attacks if your EXE Drive gauge is at or above the required amount along with their Lily Ranks. You also have Special Attacks that use up your SP. These attacks range from doing a good amount of damage, healing your allies, or Support by either raising your own and/or your allies stats temporarily or lowering your foes stats. Finally, EXE Drives are your Super Moves. They deal tons of damage but you need to unlock them through the Story, level ups, or Events on the World Map via Chirper in the city menus and require 1 or more level of the EXE Gauge to be filled. You have 2 different types of EXE Drives: One that requires just the character using it and one that requires 2 or more characters who are partnered or out in battle along with everyone else as well as a specific Lily Rank number. New to Re;birth 2 is the fact that you now have 4 characters out on the field, giving you more options to bring the pain to your foes. Dungeons and the World Map are still the same, but Re;birth 2 was not built with the Jump button in mind. This makes the dungeons pretty linear and kinda boring, like Final Fantasy 13, but the battle system is still solid.\n\nFinally, a new addition to the game is Stella's Dungeon. It's a real time, Mystery Dungeon/Spelunker-like mini-quest of sorts that involves the personificiations of the remake's developer, Felistella, going through the dungeons you've unlocked via Plans or Story. You choose a dungeon, how many floors, equip Stella with a Weapon and Armor and Felis with an Orb and Cat Necklace to increase your stats before sending them off. They always start at Level 1 once you send them out, and they'll either fail or succeed after a certain amount of real time. Succeeding gives you new items, plans, and other goodies. Failing, much like Mystery Dungeon or Spelunker, results in all of your equipment you equipped for that dungeon to be lost. I cannot stress this enough: BUY THE HISTY'S RESCUE PLAN DLC! It makes Stella's Dungeon MUCH less annoying as, once you activiate the plans given through this DLC, halves the amount of time a dungeon requires and lets you keep all your equipment if you fail,\n\nIf you haven't played a Neptunia game since Mk2, the AP system is gone, meaning you don't have to think too much about what your next plan will be. I admit that I actually miss the AP mechanic as, while it did cause some rage from some pretty difficult fights, it made you think a bit more on what attacks and items to use at a given time. The battle system is fine as is, especially with Re;birth 3 adding more options, but the AP system added a bit more strategy to the battles. Otherwise, everything is the same.\n\nStory:\n\nLet's be honest, you're not really playing Neptunia for a "gripping" storyline. The story here, while decent, is not as good as Re;birth 1 and not even close to Victory/Re;birth 3 or even V2 on the PS4. The Goddesses have been defeated by the leader of the Four Felons, an organization that promotes piracy to dwindle down the Four Nations Shares and gain enough shares to revive their own goddess, Arfoire. IF and Compa, sent by Histoire, go to the Gamindustri Graveyard to attempt to bring back the goddesses from a now 3 year sleep due to their shares now being next to nothing, but can only revive the Goddess Candidate of Planeptune, Nepgear. It's up to Nepgear to recruit the other Goddess Candidates of Lowee and Lastation (Poor Vert doesn't have a sister), gain back the shares and faith for each nation, and obtain the Mascots of each nation to bring back the Goddesses and defeat the Four Felons.\n\nAs a warning to those who complain about translations not being 1:1 to the Japanese audio or original text, this is not a faithful translation. It is a localization. I find that the writing itself is better than Mk2's, but if you want a 1:1 translation, you will not find it here. The Neptunia franchise is not one that honestly needs a literal translation. The games message is still the same and the comedy is still there. Either buy the Japanese Vita version, or wait until a fan translation or Japanese Text mod of sorts.\n\nAudio:\n\nThe OST for Re;birth 2 and Mk2 are okay, but it didn't feel as good as Re;birth 1's original tracks or Victory's overall soundtrack. The most I can say is that the game has the best battle theme in the franchise. It gets your blood pumping, it's fast, and has a wonderful composition. As someone who's loved the English voices from the start, I have not played the games in Japanese, but from the anime, the Japanese cast is good. Neptune is a bit too high pitched for me for her age, and the Candidates are just....eh. The English dub track is a great dub track, and has at least 75% of the game fully voiced in English. Melissa Fahn is still the best Neptune voice, giving a zany but mature-like voice to Neptune whenever required. If you've played Skullgirls, you'll also recognize a lot of the amazing actresses featured in that game, such as Erin Fitzgerald being an outstanding Noire to this day, Christine Miller making Nepgear sound mature, but still young, innocent, and nerdy all at the same time, and Sarah Williams delivering great lines as Uni among all the other voice actors and actresses just being plain outstanding. If you have the chance, I highly recommend giving the English audio a try at least.\n\nPC Port:\n\nAnd last but not least, the PC Port as a whole. IFI still needs to work on some kinks like adding more graphic options other than resolution and Window type, make Borderless and Fullscreen different from each other, and better optimization for various cards, CPUs and RAM requirements, but I feel like this is a much better port than R;b1. The game stays at 60 FPS much more and doesn't lock up as much, and the character models look MUCH better in battles. The portraits during cutscenes are still low quality, but this is due to Tsunako drawing them for the Vita screen, not PC. Keep reporting to IFI if you have issues in the fourms and they should fix it quickly like R;b1.\n\nTl;dr I recommend buying Re;birth 2. While it's not as good as Re;birth 1 in some aspects, it's still a good game in its own right. As a disclaimer though, I played through and helped out with the PC Beta.","May 29, 2015","true","15.5"," 85 of 103 people (83%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","83","85","103","9","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/351710/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","The original plan for this review involved an FBI interrogation, complaints about the "streets being awash in Nep-Nep", and a man in a black & pink fur-coat with matching boots. Oh and he's wearing a Hatsune Miku shirt. Plan #2 was a written account, of a failed attempt at doing a co-operative video review, between an ordinary gamer critic and fur-coat guy (aka the anime waifu warrior). Plan #3 was inspired by one beer, an existential crisis, and I had just finished watching the David Cronenberg movie "eXistenZ".\n\nYikes.\n\nSo instead of all that nonsense, you're going to be reading a straight review of Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth2: Sisters Generation. Can you feel the irony? As it burns through your skull?\n\nGamindustri is in trouble once again. Our heroines of the previous game, the CPUs, have been captured by an obviously evil woman who is dressed appropriately provocatively evil. Compa and IF arrive to make the daring rescue, but only succeed in helping NepGear. GeGe is as unlike Neptunia (NepNep or Nepu-Nepu) as you can imagine. Her personality can be summed up as "Um...I...I need to become stronger!", she actually takes her job as CPU Candidate seriously, and doesn't feel the need to break the 4th wall at every opportunity (which at times is detrimental to this game). She will eventually team up with Uni, Rom, Ram, Cave, 5pb, and nearly everyone else with a unique portrait. Their mission? Save Gamindustri from pirates....or was it piracy...hm. I think this game takes place in an ever-so-slightly different dimension than the previous title. Why? Because Gamindustri is a vast and complicated multiverse...or Idea Factory just loves writing stuff that makes no sense.\n\nLet's throw all that out the window and focus on what's most important: Underling and her plot to do bad things. She dresses like a rat, wields a pipe, and refers to chicks as broads. How is that villain-quality? She teams up with an actual rat, that fantasizes over Compa. This is all just an exercise in absoludicrosity. It feels like half the game, is spent chasing her around, attempting to stop her Team Rocket BS. Along the way Ge-Ge meets the other CPU Candidates. They don't get along very well, which leads to arguments, boss-fights, and kids...well..acting like kids. Ram & Rom have a combined age of what...10? Decades of JRPG-playing has forced me to accept that as normal but still...jeeze.\n\nMost of the unlockable characters and endings require share-manipulation. This feature from the previous game is more fleshed-out, but not really improved. The first play-through is liable to produce headaches, until you get smart and just use the colosseum to get the shares you want. However, while you can and probably should make constant saves at critical points, in order to get every ending in one play-through, NG+ is required in order to get everything (plans for additional dungeons mostly).\n\nOne of the most welcome features in a JRPG (or any genre) is New Game+. Nep2 delivers a quality NG+ experience. Between the option to fast-forward through the plot, and the strength to one-shot everything, it doesn't take long to get to the specific chapter you need. However, if you spent a lot of time unlocking everyone in your last play-through um oops? Yeah you have to unlock them again. This means you have to go back to the Colosseum for more share-shenanigans. There really should have been a simpler option. This can be especially frustrating if all of your favorite characters, are the unlockables. Plus when you run around the dungeons, you have to stare at the backside of the same chara-ack! Oh gosh! I mean their back, because dungeons are explored in 3rd-person.\n\nFanservice. Neptunia 1 had less, this game has more. Neptunia 2 also has more kids. It's not a good combination. There are a couple scenes -- one of which that shows up in every NG+ -- that just make me uncomfortable. In the end it's all supposed to be semi-innocent humor, but...I don't know. Some of the other scenes also play it a bit too close to "It's like one of my Japanese animes." Sure, Nep1 was moe, but Nep2 is like...moe cubed? I could just be overly-defensive. Back when I played through No More Heroes, I realized I was sitting in a chair that looked exactly like Travis Touchdown's. That's the kind of meta-nonsense that'll mess with your head something fierce.\n\nThe dungeons are still lousy. In fact, some are even copy-pasted from the prequel. I've given up dwelling on this aspect, because it might as well be a part of Neptunia's design. The dungeons serve their purpose: there are monsters to grind on, goodies to collect, and an object to touch that triggers plot-advancement. I'm not going to bother asking for anything more. I've got other RPGs I could play if I want dungeons with atmosphere, puzzles, depth, and whatever else. Stella's Dungeons...well...I hope to all that is everything that they're improved in subsequent games, because they're terrible.\n\nStella doesn't have an understanding of self-preservation. While you're out saving Gamindustri, she's going on excursions of her own. It's something of a rogue-like, as Stella loses everything if she dies in a dungeon. In order for her to survive, you have to send her out on short, incremental visits, so that she can acquire better equipment. But I, you, and hopefully everyone else bought the DLC that strips the massive penalties for death. Now Stella's minigame exists to say "What? You want 100% achievement completion now? Kiss my ♥♥♥ and wait!"\n\nAlso while fingers are being pointed at the localization, I have to wonder about what happened to Nep-Nep. She's become a caricature of herself. In Nep1 she was already a caricature so....Now she's something of a try-hard*, and her wackiness is less endearing as a result. Maybe it's that alternate-dimension at work. It would explain why (spoilers!) Iffy x Vert is no longer a thing. Also, as I mentioned way back, NepGear plays it a bit too on the nose. She's the heroine trying to become stronger, make a lot of friends, and say "Goodness!". Most of her best moments involve her pairing with someone else. That's fine, but a large chunk of the game is just Nepgear, Compa, and IF. Compa is the only one who comes remotely close to not playing the "straight-woman".\n\nAltogether, Neptunia Re;Birth2 is a textbook sequel. In a way it comes off as semi-cynical, like being forced to buy new college textbooks because they're the "latest edition".

Your job is to become stronger to beat up the baddies in order to restore the state of the world.\n\nIn concept, it's a parody and satire of the gaming industry and it's history. Nothing too much about ideals and higher cause -- and it constantly reminds you of it with cheeky jokes and wall-breaking interactions. Not as many jokes as Re;birth 1 so far solely due to the absence of Nep, but Red does a decent job as her replacement for a comical character.\n\nSo it's not all about the loli fantasy harem that naysayers claim it to be ( there will inevitable a bit of that, but it's within reasonable doses ;p)\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nExactly the same as Re;birth 1, but now with four characters in combat.\nThey've done a much better job with balancing difficulty curves early on in the game and considerably lessened the need for a grind.\nYour party gets useful, but balanced skills much earlier in the game to help you out with the boss encounters without needing to outlevel them by a huge margin or coming back with overpowered gear.\n\ne.g Red gets an AoE STR buff before level 18 , Compa gets paralysis removal and AoE heal before level 18 as well\n\nTherefore, the pace of the game feels a lot better than the previous game - even if it feels so much easier than the first game.\n\nGAMEPLAY PT2\n\nThis part concerns Maps and Stella's dungeon minigame\n\nMaps aren't atrocious as the Re;birth 1 with clear-cut paths to the event sign. They now have branching paths that encourage you to go to all ends to look for that loot.\n\nUnfortunately they made a deliberate decision to remove maps with elevation - the only sole purpose for jumping in a technical context.\n\nit could still be a lot more complex, but it's a considerable improvement.\n\nStella's Dungeon is a new minigame where you send off a cute little girl into a dungeon for your own benefit (*cough* Recettear)\n\nIt works in real-time and she will go through the various floors of the dungeons you've explored in hopes of getting progressively stronger gear for herself and loot for you.\n\nA fun mini-game to initiate while nepgear and her friends wander off into a dungeon.\n\n\nSOUND\n\nVery catchy new overworld music - better than Re;birth 1. New battle themes are also quite refreshing and in-line with the game.\n\nOne of the issues that I had was Nepgear's voice being muffled during special attacks (mirage dance, etc) and in certain cutscenes.\n\nAnother is the unbalanced audio volume. The overworld theme is overpowering everything else in the game when you're out there. It will drop in volume whenever a character idles and starts errant chatter, but in general it is still too loud\n\n\nso far for $14.50 , it's a steal for this cute game\n\nhave a nepping good time ~","May 31, 2015","true","19.9"," 51 of 54 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","51","54","4","2"

The maps still get recycled (and the new forest map is just a retexture of the snowfield map), but less often.\n- Idea chips aren't as frustrating to get - they don't appear in hidden treasures anymore, every harvest point now has 1 regular item affected by harvest shift, and 1 idea chip unaffected by harvest shift.\n- 4 characters in party, finally allowing you to use all 4 CPU's/Candidates in your team.\n- You get some free Lily ranks from Chirper events, alleviating the grind a little.\n- HDD activation cutscenes are faster (Plutia isn't in the game though, that helps this one a lot)\n- Characters feel more useful overall - Re;birth1 had the major issue of introducing a lot of Maker characters after you already got all the CPU's, making them relatively weak. Other way around in this game. Cave best girl <3\n- Difficulty curve is better, there's no real spike early on like that accursed Noire fight from Re;birth1 (you know the one)\n\nProbably a lot of other stuff I forgot, this was just off the top of my head.

No? Then F&!$ off.\n\nUsing an identical system to Re;Birth1, navigating this game will be like riding a bicycle if you've played any other Hypdimension Neptunia game. The combat, lily rank, remake and game dev systems are identical. If you haven't, it'll be pretty easy to pick up. Join CPU Candidate Nepgear on her journey to rescue the CPUs, and save Gamindustri once again from the evils of game piracy, low shares and ultimate destruction!\n\nAdmittedly, Nepgear is nowhere near as likeable as Neptune. She has probably the most unimaginative and cliched personality they could (not) think of. But making returning appearances are all of the developer characters, with the same endearing (and annoying) personalities, delivering the same hit and miss humour as before. Overall, the story and characters have passable writing and decent pacing, even if it is nothing new and has definitely been done before. Most notably in its prequel. But who doesn't like a game in which a SEGA takes (extremely valid) potshots at the PlayStation, XBOX and Wii?\n\nBut let's get down to the actual bad. This is a functional PC port, but it has problems and lots of them. Where Re;Birth1 ran like hot butter for me, Re;Birth2 had problems right from the off. Memory leaks, unreliable framerates, occasional UI lockups, screen tearing, buggy text wrapping and eventual crashes that sometimes required the task manager to shut down plague the port. I was able to complete the game with these issues, as none of them actually managed to break the game. But it was at times aggravating, nonetheless.\n\nUltimately, I'm giving it a 7 out of 10. It's a good JRPG, for those that are interested in the genre and don't mind a completely female cast. Without the technical issues I would give it a 7.5, maybe an 8. Hopefully Idea Factory, Compile Heart, and Felistella do something about these issues in future patches.","June 8, 2015","true","36.1"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","86","32","37","11","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/recommended/351710/","vallinek","Vallinek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/","82 products in account","Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth2: Sisters Generation is a remake of a 2011 RPG game released on the PS3, and a sequel to the first Re;Birth game. Originally a PS Vita game, it was later ported to the PC and released on Steam.\n\nJust like with Re;Birth1, it's a unique take on the idea of "Console Wars" with every console being anthropomorphised into a "Goddess". However, in this world, called Gamindustri (which should be mentioned is not the same Gamindustri we know from the first game) the four Goddesses battled the Arfoire Syndicate of International Crime, however they all lost to CFW Magic, the leader of the organisation, and together with the main heroine, Neptune's sister by the name of Nepgear, were sealed and kept in a coma in Gamindustri Graveyard. After three years of ASIC running rampant and ruining the economies of all the nations, Compa and IF with the help of Histoire manage to wake and free Nepgear, and they begin their journey to find the Mascots, other CPU Candidates (based on portable consoles), and free their older sisters.\n\nThe gameplay is basically your typical turn-based jRPG with minor tactical elements. Your characters and enemies take turns performing attacks, using abilities or items. It's rather simple to get a grasp if you played any other turn-based RPG. Outside of dungeon exploring and fighting, you can use shops, view the gallery, accept and complete quests, or use special "Plans" to add or modify existing content in the game. The difficulty feels just right - it's not as hard as old-school jRPGs, but also not easy enough that you will be bored (unless you specifically overlevel your characters for the upcoming fights, or use the horrendously overpowered Gehaburn - Anime sword). The game even hands you certain Plans that make the enemies tougher or easier, so there's always some way of tuning the difficulty a bit if you want a challenge or - the opposite - want to focus on the story. Majority of the content is grind-based, however, so if you care about exploring everything, you'll have to level up your characters quite a lot. That being said, the general progression has been improved upon in comparison to the first Re;Birth game - you don't have to grind nearly as much to get past certain boss fights.\n\nThe story is quite engaging, with you traveling and exploring different lands, attempting to get the help of the Mascots to gain enough power to free the Goddesses from their prison, interspersed with jokes about gaming cliches, breaking the fourth wall, and all sorts of humor. Of course, it's full of fanservice in one way or another, but what would you expect from a game that creates Moe Anthropomorphisms of game consoles?\n\nThe graphics are good. You might notice blurred textures here and there, but it's nothing big, and it's pretty to look at. The only reason you might not like it is if you don't like anime style.\n\nIn the sound department, we get mostly electronic music or rock, with quite a lot memorable or downright awesome themes. It's definitely worth listening to even outside the game.\n\nAs far as the DLC goes, it's kind of a mixed bag. The "additional content" DLC, when all of them are purchased, introduces a lot of new dungeons and Colliseum battles, while extending the level cap from 99 to whopping 999. But, as you can guess, all of this content is purely grind-based, so if the only thing you care about is the story and not watching your characters grow stronger, I would suggest against buying this DLC. Also, there are a lot of DLCs that make the game easier in one way or another, like giving you plans that increase the EXP you gain and such.\n\nThe game also pretty much requires New Game+ in order to unlock everything, since one playthrough does not yield enough MB (Megami Bytes) to craft every Plan you can get.\n\nOverall, this is a great game, featuring adorable, likeable characters, nice graphics, great music, interesting storyline, as well as lots of humor and content. I heavily recommend it to anyone who likes jRPGs that don't take themselves too seriously or cutesy games.","November 4, 2015","true","46.8"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","23","24","3","1"

First of all, I have only played a little bit of Mk2, which is what this game is a remake of, so I can unfortunately not point out any smaller differences between the games. Despite my playtime here I have played Re;Birth2 quite extensively on Vita previously however. Regardless, what I do know is that:\nDialogue between characters are now 2D animated portraits instead of 3D models, like they are in Re;Birth1.\nSome playable characters are gone and replaced with others. More specifically, Nisa and Gust are both replaced with the Oracles of each continent.\nWe get another ending.\nAnd I believe that’s about it for the major new features. If you’ve already played Re;Birth1, you will have a fairly good idea of what to expect from this game. So, let’s start with the actual review. Like I mentioned, the game plays out extremely similarly to Re;Birth1. When I say that, I am referring the overworld navigation, similar menus and design layout. The Remake System, which lets you tinker with the enemies and items of dungeons, is also here. While not necessarily a bad thing that stuff are similar, some might be let down by the lack of changes.\n\nCombat also plays out the same way, with you having three different customizable styles of combos (Rush, for building the EXE gauge, Power, for doing raw damage, and Break, for taking down shields). As I mentioned Rush, that also means that the EXE gauge, which lets you fire off cool looking ultimates at enemies is also here. The main difference is that you can now have four characters on the field at a time instead of three, with four more as support, which is a welcome addition.\nAlso, (for me at least) there aren’t any major difficulty spikes in Re;Birth2. I know the majority of you who played Re;Birth1 got obliterated by Black Heart in Chapter 2. I can say that I did, no shame admitting it. After all, the game did a bad job at explaining the necessity of grinding. Thankfully, Re;Birth2 is much less grindy, and has a much friendlier difficulty curve.\nThat’s not to say you won’t have to grind however, you will simply have to do it less.\n\nJudging by what I’ve written up until now, the game is seemingly a straight up improvement over Re;Birth1. I wish I could agree with that, however that is not the case. The writing, which most of you probably liked the most in Re;Birth1, is a bit lackluster. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not bad by any means, it’s just… Not of the same quality. The better jokes are few and far between, and without the original four goddesses for the most part of the story things start to derail a little. In the next game in the series, Victory, which we will get a remake of under the name Re;Birth3 in fall, there is even a running gag in how people didn’t take to Nepgear as a main character.\nPersonally, I have nothing against Nepgear, Uni, Rom and Ram. In fact, I like them very much as individual characters. It’s just that the fourth-wall-breaking-comedy is for the most part gone and the writing as a whole comes off a bit flat at times. It’s not a deal breaker by any means, but it’s worth keeping in mind.\n\nOne of my favorite new features is Stella. She is a cute little girl which is the main character of a small minigame called “Stella’s Dungeon” which plays out in real time. Here, you are able to assign Stella to explore previous dungeons you’ve beaten. If she succeeds, she will get rewards for your party and earn better equipment for herself, which will help her explore deeper dungeon levels. On the other hand, if she is defeated, she will lose everything she’s earned up to that point.\nWhile it’s a minor addition, I adored it personally and I hope that it’ll make an appearance again in future titles.\n\nWith all that said, I can definitely recommend this game if you’re a fan of anime and JRPG’s in general. However, if you haven’t played Re;Birth1 yet, do yourself a favor and play that beforehand.\nSure, levels can also feel a bit bland, and the game plays out for the most part just like Re;Birth1 did. However, if we put it into this perspective: If you liked Re;Birth1, I can guarantee that you will also enjoy this game. With a return of our beloved 2D portraits, the Victory battle system and 1080p, this is in my opinion truly the best way to experience Hyperdimension Neptunia Mk2.","May 29, 2015","true","86.5"," 49 of 70 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","49","70","5","4"

It can be a sequel in name only, be loosely connected on the first title, or be a direct sequel, and a few other options.  Hyperdimension Neptunia is a little bit of one and two, in that you have to play the first to understand anything as the game sure doesn't take the time to introduce you to everyone again('If you're playing this, you've played the first' is the logic) and pretty much everything's changed, as the game takes place in another dimension, so every event that you remember in the first game goes out the window.  Some facts are still the same though, such as characters and personalities.  Since this game is trying to be a sequel, it's only fair that we look at it as a sequel, with comparisons to the first game.  The 'feel' of the game is the same, so graphics, sounds, those are pretty much the exact same, this will be more focused on the differences in gameplay and story.\n\n\nSo the story feels a little shorter in this one, but there's more to it as well.  Characters are introduced earlier and have much more time to get their personality fleshed out..  Although one-dimensional characters are always one-dimensional.  The well-written nature has only been improved.  In fact, there are optional characters that you can scoop up along the story that have no story presence, but plenty of optional scenes that showcase their own personality.  It's a good solution from the previous game in where you suddenly got 6 characters who have a total of 9 lines.  This way you have all your characters show their personality and quirks.  However, characters unlocked through special means that also aren't related to the story still get shunned.  It was a bit of a shocker when my party almost doubled in size in the span of a few hours of gameplay.\n\nThe plot could be described as "Team Rocket is trying to destroy the world, and Jesse&James try to ruin your day, every day."  The Jesse&James in this game are fought about 10 times as you two have to be at the same area, so you always run into each other.  Pretty much every part of the story involves them somehow.  They're pretty bothersome, but needed to move the story along.\n\nLater in the game, depending on certain objectives that you complete(Possible to achieve without realizing it, but unlikely) you can branch out the story conclusions, and one of them is just heart-wrenching.  The feels felt like I was watching Clannad, but everyone dies instead of just having sad stories with happy endings.  Just sadness and feels in this ending.  The basic plot isn't better or worse, just different.\n\n\nGameplay hasn't changed much.  Battle system is the same, but has the addition of a fourth character, so fights are even easier.  As long as you kill every monster you see, you’ll have a hard time losing a fight.  The 'use Ram to get perks' is still there, with one important perk added: Exp and gold gotten when you use the ‘destroy enemy’ perk.  Otherwise, the enemy dies and you get nothing.  Conversely, the jumping star perk(2x jump height) is used for nothing at all, except to look at Uni’s underwear for a tenth of a second longer;  Feels like they improved it while leaving the old stuff there. Also, unlocking tougher dungeons follows more of a path this time, as opposed to extra bosses being all over the place and level 100 monsters in basic upgraded areas;  General improvements all-around in that area, although relying on hidden items to give plans to upgrade dungeons dungeons is a terrible idea, as the low chance of it appearing means that you HAVE to read a walkthrough to continue to upgrade dungeons.  Next to no chance of bumbling into it.\n\n\n... Of course, there are still 10,000 hats for you to get, but the amount of unique♥♥♥♥♥♥ence costumes seems to have gone down in favor of recolors.\n\n\nOne of the new things introduced was Stella's Dungeon.  This little game is best described as an idle game.  You give Stella some equipment and send her off to a dungeon.  After some real-time has passed, she comes back and if she beat the dungeon, she gives you cool loot and keeps everything.  If she fails, you keep the stuff you found but lose all your current equipment.  Pretty cute idea on a little bit of extra farming and some bonus equipment, but the problem is actually that it takes too long.  I downloaded the DLC which made the dungeons take half the time needed and Stella doesn't lose equipment upon failure.  Even with this, it still took almost a week and a half to do all of her dungeons.  Without the DLC, it'll take about a month.  Sure, it's an idle game designed as a little coffee break, but it should at least be timed so that by the time you're super powerful and done everything, it still doesn't take two weeks just to finish it.  Good idea, ultimately pointless.  If you want the achievement, just get the DLC.\n\n\nLastly, I listen to the game in Japanese voices, and have -some- idea of what they're saying sometimes, and the jokes aren't quite as ham-fisted as they were in Rebirth1, where sometimes characters would have an entire dialogue box full of words while the voice went "Un."  More effort was put into dialogue this time around, which is pretty nice, but still isn’t perfect.  Strangely, in the box Compa refers to Nepgear as Ge-Ge(Like calling Neptune Nep-Nep), but she says Gear-Chan.  I guess that's okay.\n\n\nFor me, these are pretty much the big or most notable changes going from Rebirth1 to Rebirth2.  Everything else is pretty much the same, and I'm fine with that, as it should be pretty much the same with more improvements.  So would I recommend this game?  I do!  I'm sure that there will be more improvements to come, and if you didn't like it and you saw the reason in the above, well it's fixed so you should go play this then.  ONLY PLAY THIS IF YOU'VE PLAYED THE FIRST THOUGH!\n\n\nOn a side note, they changed the special attack "Desu, Desu, Desu!" to "Yes, Yes, Yes!", and that it something I can never forgive them for.","June 10, 2015","true","70.8"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","22","25","3","0"

People are expecting you to be better than the first game and if the first game was outstandingly good it is even more hard to make a great successor. In this case, Rebirth 1 was challenging, funny, cute and had a great story line. And is Rebirth 2 also that great? Well, yes and no. Even though it does everything exactly as good as Rebirth 1. That is maybe also the problem. It is recycling the most animation, character design, etc and this is the problem. Yeah it might be also a great game, BUT if you are facing the same mosnters as in the first game, what is remaining? Only the story plot which is at least good enough to justify a successor. But there is still this dull aftertaste of recycling everything.\n\nConclusion:]But well, if you do not mind the recycling that much and you would like to see more of the same then you will get an awesome game here. It is still a great game, jus the graphics recycling makes it feel weird ( at least for me ). Never the less, I had tons of fun with this game!\n\nRating: 8/10","June 15, 2015","true","55.5"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","3"

I felt compelled to write this as a word of warning before people buy the game:\n1. This takes place in an alternate dimension, so don't be confused with the lack of continuity between this and Re;Birth\n2. The main character is Nepgear, Neptune's younger sister, who is much more serious than Neptune. This doesn't mean the game isn't funny; it is, just not as random as Neptune makes it.\n3. The storyline is more serious, but still has lots of gaming references and is still enjoyable. There's a balance between humor and drama.\n4. This is the main timeline in the series, so Re;Birth 3 takes place as an immediate sequel to this game. Even if you don't like this game's seriousness, Re;birth 3 is much more funny with less drama and it helps playing this game to understand character relationships in the sequel.\n5. Stella's dungeon is annoying without the DLC, so hopefully you either don't mind spending an extra $1 for that or that you don't mind skipping it.\n\nI'm going to split this review here between people who haven't played Mk II and those who have:\n\nFor those who haven't played Mk II:\nThe game is a solid upgrade from Re;Birth 1 (at least, the Vita version was). You get to enjoy a familiar cast of characters along with new ones. It is set in a different universe, so there may be  a few raised eyebrows concerning character relationships. The storyline is more deep and the true end doesn't come entirely out of left field like in Re;Birth 1. That being said, be aware that Neptune, Noire, Blanc, and Vert don't show up until halfway through the game, as this game is about their little sisters (save Vert, who doesn't have one, that poor woman). I love this game. I felt that Neptune is a bit too silly as a main character and that Nepgear does really well as a leader in bringing people together. She also sees a bunch of character development, unlike Neptune who didn't really change much the entire game. This opinion might be biased by my playing Mk II which had a much slower pace, so the character development might not be as gradual in this version (even though I've played it, I already knew how it occurred so I wasn't really paying attention to it this time around). If you liked the first game, you will most likely like this game. The biggest issue is whether or not you'll appreciate Nepgear. That being said, even if you dislike Nepgear, I recommend playing it so you'll know the characters for when Re;birth 3 comes out (which has Neptune as the main character).\n\nFor those who have played Mk II:\nFor starters, the pace of Re;Birth 2 is much faster than the original, which can be good or bad. The story of the game kind of makes it feel like you have to gather support to and then save the world which feels like it should take a long time, which, with the way shares worked in the original, I felt like I was actually making a difference. In this version, it's so easy to manipulate shares that I feel like it breaks the flow of the game.\nSomething I view as flawed is that they replaced the 3D animated models from Mk II with the new sprites (the same sprites from Re;Birth 1). While I like the sprites, they aren't as animated as the 3D models, which gave the game more life.\nThat being said, the Remake system is definitely a massive upgrade from Mk II. The music is improved as well. Mechanically speaking, the game is much better. As I said above though, I wish for a slower pace and for the 3D models to come back.\nOh right, one more complaint: They removed Nisa and Gust and replaced them with RED and Broccoli. This is deeply upsetting to me because Nisa was amazing. I liked Gust, too, but about as much as Broccoli, so they even each other out. RED on the other hand... well, I like her appearance but I want to shove a fist down her throat whenever she opens her mouth (Probably due to her English voice).\n\nMy Opinion:\nOverall, it's most likely my favorite game in the series. It's tied with the game it's based on (Hyperdimension Neptunia Mk II) because each have elements that the other would benefit from.\n\nNepgear is SO gonna be my waifu!","May 29, 2015","true","11.6"," 39 of 57 people (68%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","68","39","57","5","0"

Make sure you read whole review so you understand what I mean.\n\nNow due to the fact that I really didnt have high hopes for rebirth 2 cause mk2 on PS3 wasn't the greatest because of PS1 graphics and FPS issues but I didnt care because I thought this time would be different and all those issues would of been fixed. Well The graphics were just like rebirth 1 so no problem there but FPS issues oh boy let me tell you this was a slap in the face. Rebirth 1 had no issues what so ever with FPS like none always 60 fps. Now rebirth 2 had some really bad FPS issues. Most of the time the game was at 30fps even though my screen wasn't at 1920/1080p. Now you think after MK2 they would of learned from their mistakes? Guess not.\n\nBut enough of the hardware fails and on to the story and characters. Well right off the bat when I bought this game they gave me a DLC for a very overpowered weapon that killed almost everything in 1 hit. Now because of this I barely leveled any of my characters because nepgear killed everything almost instantly this kind of took the fun out of the game just a little because the game didnt have that much of a challenge. Now the story is little different from MK2. The story wasn't too bad I beat the game once without skipping anything like text and events then after that on my second and so on playthroughs I found myself skipping everything even battles because of the same old things. Now just like MK2 you have tons and tons and.... tons of endings to get 100% achievements on this game. Let me tell you I wasn't fond of this on MK2 and wasn't fond of this on rebirth 2. Plus on top of that the lilly ranks really did ♥♥♥♥ me off because you need to level them up for the endings which rebirth 1 didnt need for the endings which made the game even less enjoyable for myself.\n\nIf you're reading this and thinking why did he recommend this game even though he's telling everyone how bad the game is? The truth is I am a very hardcore fan of the hyperdimension series and even though I might hate a lot of things about the game I always find myself going back to them and finishing them up and beating everything.\n\n\nPros\n\n- Graphics were alright just like rebirth 1 nothing new.\n- A ton of things to do in the game from leveling and getting every single item drop in the game (Which takes days) -_-\n- Cute characters and funny moments. (RED is pretty annoying just saying)\n- BOOBS BOOBS BOOBS BOOBS\n- Keeps you busy for at least 2 weeks if you grind everyday.\n- 100 million gold achievement was easy.\n\nCons\n\n- DLC sword made leveling pointless (Kill everything way too fast).\n- Too many ending's.\n- Lilly ranks are dumb.\n- Not enough challenge to the game.\n- Uni needs bigger boobs\n- Aside from Nepgear the other cpu candidates seem weak as hell (No point on using them)\n- MarvelousAQL Has bigger boobs than vert\n- Bad FPS issues\n\nIn the end this game wasn't too bad but rebirth 1 was way better and I hope rebirth 3 will be even better.\n\nCheck out my review for rebirth 1\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198193064026/recommended/282900/","July 7, 2015","true","42.0"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","71","20","28","6","4"

It's my second favorite of the Re;Birth trilogy. I had some crash issues in the beginning, but I fixed it easily with the help of some community guides. It didn't take any of the fun for me.\nFor some confused people, this game doesn't happen in the same dimension as Re;Birth 1, the SuperDimension. This timeline passes in the HyperDimension.\nPros:\nGreat story!\nLOTS of endings (9, if I remember correctly).\nNew characters!\nFun dialogues.\nMore story and personality given to the CPU Candidates. In the first game it was just "oh here take those lolis, they came from the shares you got", in this one they are the focus of the plot.\nStella's Dungeon. It's like a sidequest where you send Stella (Felistella's maker character) to the dungeons you visited to collect cool items in a certain period of real world time. You can send her to do a cool mission while you sleep! I recommend buying the DLC that includes Felix Insurance for this, though. It's a plan that lets Stella keep her items even if she dies in the dungeon.\nNEP!\nGood replay value (New Game Plus adds new colosseum bosses, more dungeons and plans, etc).

This game is neither a prequel nor a sequel. It helps to know a little about the characters and the world though.\n\n~ A lot more endings than Re; Birth 1. Some are more complicated than others.\n\n~ It's not a direct translation from the native language. In fact, some lines are just plain ridicules (mostly Nep-neps). Some major "artistic freedom" was taken advantage of here. This has some people all bent out of shape. Overall the story is the same and flows well despite some overzealous attempts at injecting a certain form of humor that wasn't present in the native language.\n\n~ Grinding. Some people like it, some hate it. I never had to specifically "go level up" in order to get past a certain point if I failed. If you're a completionist you will be doing a good amount of missions to influence "Shares" and also gathering materials for crafting Plans.\n\nI'm not going to label any of these as pro's or con's. I'm not even going to give it an arbitrary numerical rating. I am enjoying this game as mush as I enjoyed Re; Birth 1.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Remyyy/recommended/351710/","Remyyy","Remy~","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Remyyy/","71 products in account","This review is mainly meant for those who played Re;Birth1 since I draw a lot of comparisons between the two games based on my immense enjoyment of Re;Birth1.\n\n-- If you want to see my first impressions after like an hour of gameplay you can scroll down a bit. --\n\n\n[Updated 06/01/2015]\n\nSo now that I have about 20 hours under my belt I figured I would update my review a little.\n\nI am currently in late chapter 4 and have take the game quite slowly by making all the dungeon plans as I go and grinding for materials, doing quests as they unlock, reading all the chirps, etc.\n\nI am still really enjoying the game and think it is comparable to Re;Birth1 as far as quality of entertainment goes. As I mentioned previously the system remains the same, but is much more polished and the game is balanced better. You get Gear's EXE drive through storyline so you can't just cheese bosses and hard enemies as readily as you could in Re;Birth1, but it's still a very easy game if you overlevel a bit, which you will if you activate the EXP Up plan early on and grind even slightly.\n\nThe game looks a bit better than the first installment. It's mostly little things like Gear's skirt and hair being animated when she jumps. For the most part the art style and quality remains the same.\n\nThe storyline is not a continuation from Re;Birth1, but is a totally new story. Things like Compa and IF knowing eachother their whole lives and the ending(s) of Re;Birth1 being totally disregarded. The story is pretty similar to parts of the story of the anime, but is still pretty far off. It's definitely a stand alone story. Plenty of nods towards the rest of the franchise though.\n\nI mentioned in my inital review that the game is not as fully voiced and while that is true I've only run into a small number of scenes that aren't fully voiced and they're all optional character scenes accessed through the information menu in the cities. So, hardly a con at all.\n\nThe only con I can really say the game has is a lack of costumes and that likely doesn't matter for a lot of people. The PS3 version of the game had a number of costumes for Compa and IF and they don't have a single one aside from their defaults in Re;Birth. Meh. They have plenty of headpieces though. I am just a sucker for character customization.\n\nOverall the game is fun as hell so far. I'm really enjoying myself.\n\n-----\n[Original Review from 05/29/2015]\n\nSo far a fantastic successor to Re;Birth1.  The system remains mostly the same with a few polished things here and there.\nThe party now consists of four girls instead of three which was something I always wished for in Re;Birth1. There are four CPUs so it makes sense to have four slots in your party!\n\nThe story so far is interesting and I am really loving the darker feel. It doesn't just feel like an addon to the end of Rebirth 1, it really has its own feel of a unique game with a good story so far. The art is the same, but some characters looks slightly different such as Histoire. The graphics when on the field and in battle are improved and the camera control is nice.\n\nOne small disappointment is that the game isn't voiced quite as fully as Rebirth was. There are some minor scenes so far that aren't voiced at all. Really not a big deal and most scenes are still fully voiced.\n\nI also grabbed all the DLC and it adds the 900 levels you would expect as well as some trivial starting items like nepbulls and whatever. The best thing about the DLCs so far are three starting weapons for Gear and three headpieces. Mostly they're references to the Neptunia anime and if you've watched that I'm sure you'll enjoy them. I expect that the added coliseum fights and plans will be awesome later.\n\nAll in all with just a taste of the game so far I would say it's going to be a fantastic game like the first one.\nI'll, of course, update this review after beating the game once and probably again after getting all achievements.","May 29, 2015","true","22.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","3"

You do not need to play the first game to understand this one. The first one is about the main four CPUs. This one is about their sisters' adventures.\n\nDo note, because this is an IF/Compile Heart game. They tend to re-use a lot of their assets. Other than that...\n\nOverall, it's relatively the same like Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;birth1. Only difference is, you can control four characters in combat instead of three. The story this time around revolves around the CPU's sisters which are personifications of handheld devices. Combat is relatively the same as the first one in the series being a positional turn-based RPG with lots of Visual Novel dialogue sequences. Several more endings in this one a lot more than the first one, so there is some replayability.\n\nIt's a cutesy RPG with lots of female characters, silly plots, and jabs at several things in the video game industry like it's predecessor in the series.

Even though it has a few game breaking bugs, but hey, RB1 also had those when it first came out and they've all been fixed over time. Anyways, review time:\n\nPros:\n\nAdvanced but easy to understand battle system: turn-based battles with attack, defend, items, skills, escape, ultimate skills, but: you can move during your turn to position yourself on the battlefield (to, for example, hit multiple enemies with penetrating skills), and after you attack once you can do combos.\nThis is what makes this game good even for people like me who don't like to play turn-based RPGs because the fighting is boring. There's more strategy and interaction involved in HDN.\n\nHumorous, semi-serious plot. Also fanservice.\n\nAnimated visual novel-like cutscenes and, though very rarely, 3D cutscenes.\n\nNice graphics and retro music, sometimes mixed with epic music. You know, with a chorus 'n' churchbells 'n' stuff...\n\nSteam trading cards: If you get one, go to your Steam inventory, click on it, view the badge progress, click on the thumbnail there to view the full image. Pretty nice. For example: 1 card shows 1 character cosplaying, if you view the full image you'll see all 4 characters cosplaying. :3\n\n\nStep-ups from the last game:\n\nA bit more 3 dimensional cutscenes, in RB1 there was only 1, at the beginning. The 3D cutscenes in RB2 after the intro mainly consist of animations used ingame (which are naturally looping), but it's something. I like it. I like it alot. Wish there were more than just 3 of them, tho. :|\nBetter effects, smexier UI\nLarger dungeons which aren't being reused as often as in RB1\nA more serious plot\nLonger story\nYou can fight with 4 characters instead of 3.\nMore characters, you may know some from the anime and missed them in RB1.\n\nCons:\n\nOn occasion the voice acting may stop in visual novel-like cutscenes, together with the mouth animation.\n\nBefore starting a battle the game might crash. It only happened to me once, at the very beginning. But, depending on how well the game runs on your computer, it might happen more frequent to you.\n\nSome of the animations are just... bad.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nLike I said, buy it. Even though it has a few problems, it's an awesome game.","May 30, 2015","true","57.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","2"

This review is going to be about my experience toward playing Re;birth1 and this game up to certain endings. I may edit this review when I complete other endings.\n\nI'm going to start from the   cons   of this game...\n\n1) This is not the sequel from Re;birth1, it is more of another universe.\n\n2) It is not 100% full audio, but mostly. Because, well, steam does not has the "Most audio" thingy.\n\n3) The sound is quiet, need to turn it up a little bit while some of the sound are at normal quality, which results in loud noise.\n\n4) I'm playing at home(GPU su&ks), intel graphic GPU, mostly dropped to 30fps and sometimes 11fps during battle. My custom PC is at another place, sad.\n\n5) From number 4, I have disappointed my parents so much they never look at me the same way again.\n\n6)  Compa does not say "Desu" as much as she did in Re;birth1.\n\n7) (Edit) Be warn, if your are going to do conquest ending, prepare your emotion because it might make you cry and a big hurt in your heart. (Well if you care to read the story of course).\n\n8) After lots of playthrough, I have created swimsuit for each of my CPU candidates and the results? Boy, I don't know how to explain about this if my parents see it.\n\nAnd now....   the Pros   ...\n\n1) Although not much, you got to see the more ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) than Re;birth1.\n\n2) In re;birth1, my waifu is Compa, but my life has changed because of Nepugear <3. She will be my waifu.\n\n3) Very quality song, would want it for my ringtone, but other people might think of me in the negative way.\n\n4) Nepugear.\n\n5) Kawaii as always :3.\n\n6) Some scenes are very emotional, they might make you cry.\n\n7) Audience voice during concert was hillarious as sh%t.\n\n8) Nepugear.\n\nRecommend this game? Why?\nNepugear is enough reason why i recommend this game.\n\n10/10 looking forward to see more ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) in Re;birth3.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=577224881","December 18, 2015","true","124.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

On PC, it's buggier than a big bug bugging out in a dune buggy:\n\n-General performance issues causes inconsistent framerate that can tank from 60 to 9 FPS when the game loads during a dungeon.\n-CG scenes are potentially hobbled by lagging audio and skipping video. Currently, I have not been able to fix this.\n-Enabling select DLC (I've found the Additional Content Packs and Histoire's Rescue Plans to be hassle-free) may cause scripting errors.\n-Crashes are not frequent, but can happen at critical moments where saving is not possible. Bear in mind this is my account as someone who uses an AMD GPU. Should you use an Intel one, your experience may be different and potentially worse.\n-The game may not load on start-up, prompting a trip to Task Manager to end the process. Also, it may simply cut the knot and crash every time instead. These issues have not been patched.\n-The game may suddenly stop recognizing controller inputs. To fix this, open up the config menu, then switch your input of choice from controller to keyboard and back again.\n-Memory leaks, ho!\n-If you're unlucky, you will always crash past a certain event in the plot, usually after the prologue. I had this issue for a long time, which eventually went away for no apparent reason. NO, THE GAME HAS NOT BEEN PATCHED.\n-Some artwork has not been upscaled for HD resolutions, resulting in pixelation of otherwise terrific backgrounds and artwork.\n-The sound mixing is awful. Dungeon music is too quiet, world map BGM is far too loud, and effects are always leaning on the extreme ends of the scale from "pen drop" to "Linkin Park concert".\n\nAnd those potentially aren't the last of the issues that exist.\n\nThe game has been patched in June, but resulted in even more problems cropping up. As a result, the patch was undone a day later. The devs have remained quiet since then, and with the release of Re;Birth3, it is unlikely Re;Birth2 will ever be fixed.\n\nI was able to soldier on through all the issues and fully complete the game on all my avaliable free time over the course of two months. It's still got the irreverent charm the series is known for, with addicting gameplay and a short-but-sweet length that compels you to come back and get all nine endings. But as a Vita owner, I have to question if it was really worth my patience.\n\nRe;Birth2 as a game is great. Re;Birth2 as a PC port is simply dreadful.\n\nThis review will be updated should patches come out.\n\nP.S. I've spent around 10 of my 75 hours simply finding solutions to fix my issues. On a side note, Re;Birth2 has repeatedly caused my computer to overheat and automatically shut down to avoid damage to internal systems. This is likely an issue relegated to myself, however.\n\nOne advantage the PC version does have over the Vita version is the ability to have mods. For those that find the dialogue intolerable (I personally find it fine but wish Neptune's lines were completely altered), you can mod it out with a retranslation here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=542831125","October 19, 2015","false","75.6"," 24 of 45 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","24","45","3","0"

My japanese is 0 to none, but i do notice several mistranslation in the dialogue, mostly replacing simple word with more meme flavored sentence.

If you're looking for an RPG with solid gameplay and depth, this game is definitely not for you.

Which may sound bad to a select few but it works really well.\n\nMusic\nmmmm nothing really new a lot of tracks were re used from the first game so i can't say to much about this.\n\nPresentation\nEasy to navigate menus makes rpg's a lot more enjoyable then people think. When your playing an rpg you want to know where everything is and you want to be ableto get to it easily this g ame eacomplishses tha. I have played some rpg's where the menu system just sucks.\n\n\nVoice acting\nI generally done care about voice acting in games but i will give credit when it is good. The voice actors give colorful characters  life and do it well. You can tell each character has thier own personality.\n\nGame difficulty\nHonestly a lot easier then the first game i pretty muched breezed trough it without having to look up a guide to find out where stuff was or how to get things.\n\nLevel cap\nThe level cap in the game (main story) is 99 but.... Im pretty sure you have to buy the dlc to get your level cap to 999! Which is nuts but if you want more enjoyement out of the game and plenty of grinding well then the dlc is for you.\n\nOverall a decent experaince but the final boss was kind of meh ...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Didymuss/recommended/351710/","Didymuss","Didymuss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Didymuss/","194 products in account","I should have wrote this review months ago but got distracted.Overall\nYeah, it's pretty awesome. My love for the Neptunia series only grows with every installment and this is no exception.\n\nIs is the best game ever? Of course not, that title is still held by Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth, and this shall continue forever.\nBut Neptunia 2 is damn fun.\n\nThis review is, I imagine, going to be talking about the first game alot as, for the most part, they are extremely similar. This is more a review of the game as a sequel than as a stand alone title.\n\nI'm still referring to the game as Neptunia 2 because I'm no less lazy than I was when I wrote the review for Neptunia 1.\n\nPort Quality.\nNot much has changed since the port for Neptunia 1, aside from that patch that killed the game for roughly twenty minutes before Idea Factory panicked and reverted it with an apology. (Good on ya, for paying attention, guys, everyone would have gone nuts without their daily Nep Nep dose and as a programmer myself I know how easy it is to overlook what it is you're not fixing.)\n\nI did notice what I believe to be a memory leak, but it took such a long time and so much tabbing out to come into effect I don't really consider it worth mentioning.\n\nThere is, however, a problem actually worth mentioning.\nI'M STILL DEAF, GUYS. WHY DO SOUND LEVELS DEFAULT TO MAX? THIS IS BAD, STOP IT.\n\nSounds should default to half, at most, and settings should be remembered on boot, not on load.\n\n(This has, fortunately, been sort-of fixed as of the Fairy Fencer F port, which does tie sound levels to save files. I assume they read my amazing review and realised what to do.)\n\nSo, onto gameplay\nAgain, this is very much like Neptunia 1. The story does, however, begin with 100% more Lady Heart bondage in the ever-grim lands of the Console Graveyard.\n\nIn Neptunia 1, you're running around with a three Goddess party, slapping everything in sight. This isn't bad but there's something lacking, something more. A fourth slot, to be precise. Which is, rather wonderfully, part of the battle system in Neptunia 2. Though the extra slot brings you up to only four party members, everything feels better while still retaining challenge. This is such a small change but personally I find this wonderful. Three man parties don't feel nice to use and five can be too many, four is the sweet spot for many JRPGs.\n\nOther parts of the battle system have been improved upon. You may remember me talking about how some things, such as super moves or other spells are introduced extremely early, but the moves themselves are so late to the party that you've long since forgotten they exist. The devs did it right this time and everything is introduced properly. I did already know how everything would work but from an objective perspective, the battle system is explained in a far superior fashion in this installment.\n\nMuch of everything else is the same. Dungeons are better, they're mostly more than one stage long unlike the first game, which was probably the most dissapointing part of the first game. The dungeons look better, as well, which is nice. All the post game is still locked away in the Plan System but this time there's slightly less Googling to find that one dungeon unlock you're missing. It still happens, but less so.\n\nEverything is generally better. Except for Ai-chan (IF) who got nerfed for some reason. Presumably because she carried your party untill you got the Goddesses in Neptunia 1 and IF themselves didn't want to look too awesome too consistently. I thought it was a shame but Red, to a lesser extent, fills IF's shoes. Then you get the Goddesses back and they all get relegated to the party menu forever more anyway (except for Cave, who is wonderful in every possible way). Conversely, Neptune herself is alot better in this one. She was a little lacklustre in Neptunia 1, ironically, and the other Goddesses were just better. Neptune is much more than worth having on your party this time around.\n\nThere's also a minigame called Stella's Dungeon, which is totally brilliant and has tonnes of character for something that just fetches you items occasionally. Definitely worth a go, especially if you want those achievements.\n\nThe Story\nSadly, the story takes a bit of a hit to make room for the generallybetterineveryway rest of the game. The idea is cool and the baddies are interesting (phwoar, CFW Magic), but too much of the story is around Nepgear's self esteem issues. Which are boring. It's all well and good that Noire (and the others, I believe) tell her to pull her socks up and get on with it, but its still boring. The ending is good, there's more to get this time around, including a bad ending, which is really rather dark, and not just because they apply a monochrome filter to everything as a result. Mildly related, The final boss is a furry, instead of Arfiore proper.\n\nOverall\nThe game is loads of fun, moreso to play than it's predecessor, less so as a story than it's predecessor. I'd still pay full price for it and all the DLC anyway and will do when 3 comes out because this series is fantastic. I highly recommend it to all.\n\nAlso, it must suck to live in your older sibling's shadow. Especially when your older sister is Noire and is absolute perfection, in your own game, no less.","October 24, 2015","true","172.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Which may sound bad to a select few but it works really well.\n\nMusic\nmmmm nothing really new a lot of tracks were re used from the first game so i can't say to much about this.\n\nPresentation\nEasy to navigate menus makes rpg's a lot more enjoyable then people think. When your playing an rpg you want to know where everything is and you want to be ableto get to it easily this g ame eacomplishses tha. I have played some rpg's where the menu system just sucks.\n\n\nVoice acting\nI generally done care about voice acting in games but i will give credit when it is good. The voice actors give colorful characters  life and do it well. You can tell each character has thier own personality.\n\nGame difficulty\nHonestly a lot easier then the first game i pretty muched breezed trough it without having to look up a guide to find out where stuff was or how to get things.\n\nLevel cap\nThe level cap in the game (main story) is 99 but.... Im pretty sure you have to buy the dlc to get your level cap to 999! Which is nuts but if you want more enjoyement out of the game and plenty of grinding well then the dlc is for you.\n\nOverall a decent experaince but the final boss was kind of meh ... I took it out in a few turns at level 75ish There are multiple endings super bosses ect.","February 7","true","18.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game strongly encourages grinding since levels give so much stats.\n- Hardly any strategy involved, just grind levels until you start crushing every enemy\n- Weak, nonsensical story\n\nVERDICT:\n\nIf you already know you're in for (i.e. the Neps), go right ahead and get this game. If you're looking for an RPG with solid gameplay and depth, this game is definitely not for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lexifox/recommended/351710/","lexifox","Finding Namor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lexifox/","297 products in account","Like the game before it, Rebirth 2 tells the story of four CPU goddesses and their fight to save video games.\n\nThe story is set in an alternate universe from the original. The angle of the four fighting to decide best console is dropped to focus more on their war with piracy. Also unlike the first, the subtlety is dropped: the villain is the embodient of piracy, sin, and destruction, and the evil organization seeks to fill the world with bootlegs and illegal downloads. When the game begins, the CPUs are subdued and held captive. Without the four to protect their lands, their sisters, fittingly inspired by handhelds, are forced to take up the cause.\n\nThe game itself is very much a sequel. Much of it remains unchanged, if only because Rebirth 1 was inspired by its sequel, but much more focus and polish has gone into the game. The game's humor and quirkiness remains intact, and even more self-aware than before, even eager to lampshade the younger moe cast and take shots at the otaku fanbase. The world, art, locations, and enemies are reused from the older game, but a good number of new environments and monsters are added. The music just as strong. The grind is also lessened from before, particularly if you invest in the DLC and get some helpful bonuses off the bat.\n\nThe battle system still involves choosing between attacks that focus on reducing enemy guard, dealing heavy HP damage, or building a combo meter for special attacks. Characters have unique techniques that drain their SP (MP) or powerful attacks that drain a certain amount of the combo meter. A notable change is that the party limit is now four, allowing for a larger meter and more combination attacks between certain members.\n\nThe Remake sytem also returns, allowing players to craft recipes that add new items to stores or dungeons to the world map, alter dungeons, their items, and the monsters within, or even add new characters to the party.\n\nA new function is Stella's Dungeons, which allows you to assign an NPC to expolore dungeons you've discovered. She can find new items for herself or you to use, or possibly fail and lose everything (without the proper DLC, anyway). The exploration is done in real time, which can be annoying for players who don't want to toy with their computer's clock.\n\nHowever, while the game itself is sound, the port is not. FPS drops when Guard Break triggers are common (check the guides for a fix), cutscenes can lag, loading can sometimes be Iffy, and many report freezing around a certain Castle. Most of these issues are minor or only seem to affect the minority, so you'll probably be safe. Probably.\n\nOverall, if you enjoyed the first game, you'll enjoy this one, too.\n\nalso noire is still best waifu and conquest ending hurts","March 24","true","66.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Ah, and with lovingly crafted art, music, and the ability to control the action, vidcons are the ultimate combination of the high arts. While I tend to play the stoic, I will be the first to admit that vidcons have driven me to cry, to scream and shout, to feel actual hate; such is the power of this force beyond our wildest reckoning. And here I am, before you, to tempt your tongues with the taint of such a tantalizing topic. And the Japanese, the true geniuses behind the world of video games. Pah, I throw my scorn upon such incompetents of the West who would mock the true art of the Japanese with "games" such as Baldur's Gate and Madden. Perhaps the West is not as intelligent as the East, but this is a matter for another day. Japan has given us such masterpieces as the Final Fantasy series, Star Ocean, Wild Arms, and of course, Arc the Lad. Yes, some of the finest vidcons in the world were created by the Japanese. I come to you today to ask you in all earnesty, what is your favorite vidcon?

Nepgear will 1 hit kill bosses for 40k damage when you are level 2 or 3, she will do about 40x the damage of other party members the same level.  So either don't equip them early on, or just chalk it off to her being Neptune's sister who of course is an over the top badass.\n\nThe DLC is optional, can be enabled or disabled at any time. So if you hear complaints about OP items or the controversial LVLUP plan, remember you can reserve those for when you think they fit your style. With 999 levels available(assuming you have the DLC), having something to speed that up isn't a bad thing at all.\n\nYou will be playing this for multiple playthroughs if you want to really unlock stuff.

Or give up and give it a nasty review, one of the two.\n\nThis last one is the biggest issue. The game feels terribly underdeveloped compared to the first and third. The devs must have realized they were short on content so they made the bonus unlockable characters & "True ending" require multiple playthroughs to accomplish.\n\nI have heard people claim you can get all achieves with 3 playthroughs.

Having a four member party, for instance? Way better than 3.\n\nHowever, the endings are a lot less fun to chase after. Having to futz with all of those lily levels so much can get really frustrating, and unlike in 1, maps do not stay unlocked when you replay. So if you NG+ and forget to get some item for a plan you didn't have yet, you have to wait until the plot loops.\n\nNepgear is also not really as good at being a protag as Neptune was. She isn't unlikable or anything, but she lacks a strong personality. She's just wishywashy about everything. This makes her the "straight man" (none of those meanings are accurate besides the less funny one who is somewhat serious) which she is okay at, but is not really as enjoyable since this means all of the other characters are who you have to rely on for humor or a strong personality.\n\nOn the other hand, the gameplay is improved for having four people, Stella's Dungeon is a neat thing if you have the DLC to prevent wasted time, and once you get past some of the fetch quest beginnings, it does become more enjoyable. I'd just say that overall 1 was a better experience, even if 2 has better systems in place for some aspects.","September 3, 2015","true","65.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Otherwise play something else.\n\nRe;Birth2 reuses very much things from the Re;Birth 1. New Characters are few and the old ones have remained the same. They look, sound and even their moveset has remained exactly same. Of course characters are unlocked in a different order, so fighting in the early part of the game feels a bit different. However, most of the areas are new. Most new stuff is in music and voice acting (duh). New  music tracks are nice, but they are inaudible or will drown under every other sound because of  botched up sound levels. Unlike Re;Birth1, this one isn't fully voice acted and perhaps 10% of scenes are missing sound. Because of high reuse, Re;Birth2 doesn't really feel like a new game after Re;Birth1.\n\nRe;Birth2 has its stand-alone issues and annoyances. Some game-design choises are really hard to understand. The biggest problem of the game is bad scripting and it is worsened by a very awful english translation. When the first game was absolutely nonsense and therefore great, this one is clichéd growthstory of timid a girl into the role of world savior. Also making piracy focus of the story doesn't really work. This is especially because without humour the topic turns easily into preaching. Good side of the script are new side characters. However making only fun of character's one-dimensional personality doesn't work on the fifth or sixth encounter.\n\nInteresting feature of the game is that it has 4 unique endings. Two of those endings change storyline of the last chapter and one adds extra chapters. This means there is maybe 20 hours of (alternative/additional/hidden) game content.\n\nHowever there are some huge issues considering the endgame and those chapters. First of them is that there isn't even a single hint in the game about how to obtain those endings. Because of that the player is forced to seek answers from the internet which is always negative thing for a game.\n\nSecond problem is forced NG+. In order to be able to view next ending, the game has to be completed again. Only inventory, character lvls and plans are carried over. This  means that all of the characters have to be recruited again and effectively most of the late game characters become useless. Also several hours of gameplay is required to reach areas already visited. In worst case you might want some material for a plan from some late area but are playing NG+.\n\nIn Re;Birth2 case NG+ doesn't add anything to the new to the game, it is only forced running through of underleveled enemies and it gets tedious. Second time might be manageable, but fourth forced playthrough is really a task... I watched quite much tv while playing Re;Birth2\n\nIn addition one really weird thing in Re;Birth2 is clothing. In Re;Birth1 vanity items were a huge feature; literally several hundreds pieces of clothing to make your girls prettier/original looking. In Re;Birth2 those same pieces of clothing cost 50 times more. With the price of a single hairpin you could often decent new weapons, armors and accessories for the whole party. And outfits... they cost more than final weapons of the main game.\n\nAbout the DLC: The stuff in those is very very late game related (everything else is done related). Consider buing those only after you have played 100 hours or more and still want to start grinding exp.","September 14, 2015","true","114.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

BEFORE YOU BUY THIS GAME YOU MUST KNOW!!\n-The gameplay is pretty much worse than Re;Birth1 with less refined and arranged (expect where you get to play 4 characters in the battle scene rather than 3 which I personally though is great).\n-The game system changes from Re;Birth1, Lily is now more harder to level and exp-boost required you to buy DLC. The plans of the game mostly required you to find it from monster (including basic customes plans which in Re;Birth1 just simply give it to you).\n-The cost of all items in game is much more higher than Re;Birth1 so becareful spending you credits and plan where to farm your quest for you credits\nAND MOST IMPORTANTLY!!! RE;BIRTH1 HAS FULL AUDIO DIALOUGE ON EVERY CHARACTER SCRIPT BUT RE;BIRTH2 HASN'T AND NOT TO MENTION THE TRANSLATION IS WAY WORSE THAN RE;BIRTH1, SO PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!

First of all i don't agree with automatically activating the DLC Pippin Set (thank you for still reminding Fairy Fencer <3), Eye Maks and that ridiculously OP sword from the beginning. In fact i refused to play with such advantage and i acted as if nothing was there. Also i admit that despite this detail, this chapter wasn't as challenging as the first one, it was very easy and the bosses weren't tough. However the storyline is way more complicated in this title, there are many different endings and they are very long to achieve. While talking about the gameplay and the graphics (and again... some bosses), they are still the same of Re;Birth1. However i don't blame this aspect, because i really cared about the plot, strengthened with the new cute CPU Candidates.\nSo... nothing else to say, if you enjoyed Re;Birth1 then i suggest you to follow this awesome series (maybe waiting like me for a pretty Steam Sale :D).\n\nPs: Despite i fell in love with Nepgear, liked a lot Chika, Falcom and 5pb, i have to admit that Neptune is Neptune, NEPNEP IS WAY TOO KAWAII ^^ (Noire and HDD Neptune are currently my best Hyperdimenion Waifus).\nOh i was almost forgetting... WHERE DID MAGES GO??? DID SHE FOUND HER DR. PEPPER? WHO KNOWS... EL.....PSY......KONGROO......\n\n[ITA] Ed eccoci con questo secondo fantastico episodio :D Mi sono davvero divertito a giocare sia il primo che il secondo capitolo, uno mi è piaciuto più dell'altro per diversi motivi e viceversa per l'altro.\nPrima di tutto non concordo con il fatto che sin dall'inizio del gioco si ha la possibilità di avere il DLC del set di Pippin (grazie per aver ricordato ancora Fairy Fencer <3), gli accessori e quella spada ridicolmente OP. Infatti mi sono rifiutato di  giocarmi questo titolo con questi vantaggi e mi sono goduto il tutto facendo finta di niente. Ma nonostante questo dettaglio, devo dire che a differenza del primo capitolo qui per tutto il gioco non c'è stata una grande sfida, è stato tutto fin troppo scorrevole senza intoppi. Comunque la trama risulta molto più complessa e infatti ci sono molti più finali da conseguire, e il tutto richiede davvero parecchio tempo. Parlando di gameplay e di grafica, è rimasto tutto invariato (e di nuovo... anche certi boss). Ma non critico questo aspetto, anzi, il punto chiave di questo gioco è la trama, aspetto che viene rafforzato in questo capitolo ulteriormente con la comparsa delle nuove kawaii candidate CPU :D Quindi... non c'è molto da aggiungere, se il primo capitolo vi è piaciuto allora vi consiglio altrettanto Re;Birth2. (Magari ad un prezzo un pò più ragionevole, aspettate come me per i saldi!)\n\nPs: Nonostante mi sia innamorato  di Nepgear (soprattutto!), Chika, Falcom e 5pb, non c'è niente da fare ma Neptune è Neptune, NEPNEP E' TROPPO KAWAII ^^ (Noire e Neptune in forma HDD sono attualmente le mie Waifu preferite di Hyperdimension Neptunia).\nQuasi dimenticavo... CHE FINE HA FATTO MAGES??? AVRA' TROVATO LA SUA DR. PEPPER? CHI LO SA... EL......PSY......KONGROO.....","January 10","true","22.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Otherwise play something else.\n\nRe;Birth2 reuses very much things from the Re;Birth 1. New Characters are few and the old ones have remained the same. They look, sound and even their moveset has remained exactly same. Of course characters are unlocked in a different order, so fighting in the early part of the game feels a bit different. However, most of the areas are new. Most new stuff is in music and voice acting (duh). New  music tracks are nice, but they are inaudible or will drown under every other sound because of  botched up sound levels. Unlike Re;Birth1, this one isn't fully voice acted and perhaps 10% of scenes are missing sound. Because of high reuse, Re;Birth2 doesn't really feel like a new game after Re;Birth1.\n\nRe;Birth2 has its stand-alone issues and annoyances. Some game-design choises are really hard to understand. The biggest problem of the game is bad scripting and it is worsened by a very awful english translation. When the first game was absolutely nonsense and therefore great, this one is clichéd growthstory of timid a girl into the role of world savior. Also making piracy focus of the story doesn't really work. This is especially because without humour the topic turns easily into preaching. Good side of the script are new side characters. However making only fun of character's one-dimensional personality doesn't work on the fifth or sixth encounter.\n\nInteresting feature of the game is that it has 4 unique endings. Two of those endings change storyline of the last chapter and one adds extra chapters. This means there is maybe 20 hours of (alternative/additional/hidden) game content.\n\nHowever there are some huge issues considering the endgame and those chapters. First of them is that there isn't even a single hint in the game about how to obtain those endings. Because of that the player is forced to seek answers from the internet which is always negative thing for a game.\n\nSecond problem is forced NG+. In order to be able to view next ending, the game has to be completed again. Only inventory, character lvls and plans are carried over. This  means that all of the characters have to be recruited again and effectively most of the late game characters become useless. Also several hours of gameplay is required to reach areas already visited. In worst case you might want some material for a plan from some late area but are playing NG+.\n\nIn Re;Birth2 case NG+ doesn't add anything to the new to the game, it is only forced running through of underleveled enemies and it gets tedious. Second time might be manageable, but fourth forced playthrough is really a task... I watched quite much tv while playing Re;Birth2\n\nIn addition one really weird thing in Re;Birth2 is clothing. In Re;Birth1 vanity items were a huge feature; literally several hundreds pieces of clothing to make your girls prettier/original looking. In Re;Birth2 those same pieces of clothing cost 50 times more. With the price of a single hairpin you could often decent new weapons, armors and accessories for the whole party. And outfits... they cost more than final weapons of the main game.\n\nAbout the DLC: The stuff in those is very very late game related (everything else is done related). Consider buing those only after you have played 100 hours or more and still want to start grinding exp.","September 14, 2015","true","114.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;birth 2 takes place in a different dimension.\n\nSo what's new in this game? Its's not too much of a change from Re;birth 1. Same battle system as the first game which was inspired by the battle system in HDN Victory. There is a 4 person team (with 4 more as backup) instead of 3 (with 3 as backup). There's a new little feature where you send a character to go get items for you while you quest. That's pretty much it.\n\nIf you haven't played a Hyperdimansion Neptunia game, it's pretty simple. A fun JRPG with lots of cute characters, fan service and a nice battle system. When I say lots of cute characters, I seriously mean it. You will be flooded with characters to choose from in your battle roster.

Gameplay wise, Re;Birth2 offers just that. It's practically the same game as its predecessor at the core, with a few minor chances.\n\nCompared to the first game, Re;Birth2 has a better presentation, it looks more refined and polished. The gameplay is exactly the same with just one change - you can now bring one additional party member to the field, for a total of four.\n\nUnfortunately, the content seems to have taken a turn for the worse. The characters and the story look less involved and more superficial than before. The goddess candidates aren't quite as fleshed out as their elder counterparts were.\nThe main antagonist for the first half of the game, while never particularly menacing to beging with, keeps recurring time and again to the point where nobody could take her seriously anymore. Granted, the previous game didn't really have a threatening villain either, but seeing the same character try for another round after a dozen failed attempts to sabotage us, one can't help but wonder what's going on in their heads. Similar levels of incompetence are displayed by the heroines, who manage to let their enemies get away with it each and every time, despite outclassing them on several levels.\n\nThe leveldesign (more specifically, the copy-pasted dungeons), one of the biggest drawbacks of the predecessor, has been improved quite a bit, but ultimately it still leaves to be desired.\nOn the other hand, Re;Birth2 is much more linear. While about half of the dungeons in the previous game were optional side content, this one barely offers more a handful, which forces you onto an almost completely linear path. However, Re;Birth2 does have multiple different endings, and some dungeons are restricted to chapters only accessible by certain endings. Which, unfortunately, brings me to another point: materials from these dungeons are required for certain "Stronger Enemies" Plans, which in turn drop materials required for other Plans, and so on, to the point where almost half the items and Plans in the game are gated behind dungeons only accessible in one particular ending.\n\nExcept for the seemingly obligatory early game roadblock, which you'll meet much sooner than Blackheart in Re;Birth1, the difficulty looks very consistent, with another exception in the form of one incredibly difficult encounter during one of the endings, which can be very tough even for overleveled parties. Overall I found the difficulty to be slightly lower than in Re;Birth1.\n\nAbout the localisation... as someone who places great importance on accurate translations, I'm just going to pretend it doesn't even exist. Fortunately, there's a fan-made retranslation patch available. Unfortunately, while it applies some much needed improvements, it's far from perfect. If you understand some japanese, you'll notice that what the characters say and what you read is often quite different.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're looking for another dose of cute girls doing cute things, you'll find it here, and the gameplay is practically the same as in the previous game. But most of the content Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth2 has to offer seems to be a level below its predecessor, which makes it an overall slightly less enjoyable, but still fair experience in my opinion.","March 28","true","91.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The difference in this one is that you are using the younger sisters of the charecters from the first game. Those sisters got put into a trap and you(as Nepgear) have embarked on a quest to get them back. In the mean time game industry is being plagued with piracy and cheats breaking the economy.\n\nSo what to say about this then, well firstly the storyline is shorter then the first game, with 1 playthrough i took 23 hours to finish the original campaign, this took 18 hours. That being said the first game had two endings, i believe this has six or seven each with their own requirements. Beyond that the whole of the roster from the first game make a stand(apart from peachy and plutia as far as i know) but you have to earn them instead of them just being thrown at you as part of the campaign, there are a few graphical changes to the recurring charecters as well and a few more combo ex skills for our protagonists.\n\nGenerally the formula hasnt changed much, some will like that while others will not, pretty much all of the features from the first game return in addition there is a new charecter by the name of stella which you can throw into dungeons and she will give you all the crap she finds, she works in real time even if you arent playing the game so for example if you send her off for 12 hours and then sleep for a day when you launch the game she will be done searching whatever she is doing, a neat feature but not amazing. There appears to be more plan content however as for clothing it could just be me but it seems like there is less of that.\n\nThe general banter and stupidity between the charecters is still there also which is great as it is just as hilarious as the first game, its still dubbed and subbed so you get to pick what you like more. A small issue is that there are a few areas which didnt get dubbed, this isnt the end of the world and it doesnt effect the storyline or quality\n\nA minor issue that i would like to point out is that there is a cache issue with the game and it turns into a problem, basically the game will crash when you try to enter a dungeon, seems quite game breaking, well whatever it is there is a simple solution, change the shortcut that steam uses to the exe in the game directory, no clue what its about and you would think that this is the link that is already being used.\n\nThe game runs at 60fps 99% of the time(you can push it higher in an ini file easily) anyways when you break the enemy defence the game will drop to 30fps for about half a second, sometimes you will notice it sometimes you will not, i have no clue why that happens, it something that i would like fixed however it really isnt gamebreaking.\n\nIn the end i still think that the first game was better, i believe that is because i like the personalities of that game a little better however this is a worthy sequel to that game without a doubt, there are many hours of fun in this game, if you like anime, rpgs, jrpgs, hack n slash or comedy in general the hyperdimension series is one hell of a buy.\n\nWhile it works fine with keyboard it works better with a controller.","August 6, 2015","true","23.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I would say a definite yes at $15\n\nI like this game better than the first. I think it's the protagonist, and the sisters. It's not because Nepgear's Japanese voice is Yui Horie, a famous singer and anime character voice in Japan.\n\nNepgear is probably the most boring character in the series, but as a protagonist, it works. Chrono of Chrono Trigger really isn't that interesting, but that doesn't matter as much because the player is the one that makes him interesting. The same I feel goes with Nepgear. You actually feel like you are Nepgear. This is unlike the first game, where I felt like I was just along for the ride with Neptune. Nepgear is the girl next door-type character, but she also is a pretty blank slate. Because of this, I feel that she is allowed to grow as a person in this game\n\nThe conquest ending would almost only be possible with Nepgear, and I bet the creator of the game felt like it would be a good opportunity to write it. I would recommend doing that ending because it's actually an incredibly well-written arc. You can see the many reactions it has already gotten in these reviews\n\nIt feels like the main CPUs/goddesses are made by a "how to design a Japanese cartoon character personality" book, especially in the first game. So, the sisters add a good dynamic to the story. They aren't as stuck into ideals and prejudices that their older siblings may have grown into. Also, the interactions they have with their sisters are very amusing and add a lot to the story.\n\nBecause this is a remake, many animations and victory voicings have been recycled between this and the first game.

It's a very nice touch that they probably didn't need, but did anyways. Playing 4 characters instead of 3 is also nice, especially how large your party can get\n\nThe sword DLC actually made the game incredibly easy. It was too easy to rely on Nepgear.

The game shines more so however in the characters.\n\nIf your a pretty big anime fan, or fluent gamer, this game is filled with references to popular animes, and video game-related products. The entire concept of the Hyperdimension series is four goddesses; representing an old cancelled Sega console (The Sega Neptune), Xbox, Playstation and the Nintendo Wii, which ironically enough are engaged in a war coincidentally called "The Console War"(sound familiar?). And this game in particular focuses on the goddess's younger sisters. Which represent the "portable" versions of what the CPUs represent, such as the Nintendo DS, PS Vita, and the Sega Game Gear. Aside from the obvious references, there are a plethora more that are hidden and can be found if you know your someone who in the past has played nintendo, xbox, playstation or any other video game platform aside from steam.\n\nAll in all, in order to enjoy the game to it's fullest, you need to be able to recognize a bunch of the references it has. And since the game was developed as a monument to console gamers and anime fans alike, simply buying the game without any past experiences on playing on game consoles or anime shows can make the game seem pretty stale like your average moe cheesy RPG. So in other words, if you watch anime, and have played other gaming platforms, you'll find it that you can relate to this game quite a lot.\n\nThis sequel retains much details from the previous games and basically the same graphics. It is however, much much more darker should take the conquest ending path. I would explain it, but doing so would tarnish the feels that come with it.\n\nWatching the conquest ending nearly brought tears to my eyes, and I wouldn't recommend skipping through it as it's like basically spitting on a good book.","August 13, 2015","true","413.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you haven't played Re;Birth 1, check that out first as this game's story will make a lot more sense if you do.\n\nDifferences between this and Re;Birth1 are:\n- 8-player parties instead of 6-player (you use 4 active characters and have another 4 at the 'back' who act as assists and can be switched in if needed)\n- More of a focus on the CPU Candidate characters (Nepgear, Uni, Rom and Ram). You only really get back to the original CPU cast later, depending on your actions\n- Way more endings, you'll need to complete this a lot of times if you want to see every ending.\n\nPersonally I prefer Re;Birth 1 because of the story. The second game is decent but some things feel very forced (such as fighting Underling/Warechu almost all the time). The game actually pokes fun at this but it doesn't make it any less dull. I don't really think the story for Re;Birth 2 is as strong as the original but that shouldn't stop you playing it. The battle system is still fun and there's still a wide variety of characters to experiment with.\n\nWould recommend but only if you've played the first Re;Birth game beforehand.","June 27, 2015","true","22.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story is somewhat interesting and the combat is fully fleshed out, compitent, and thought invoking. The animations are high quality and the Sp skills and E.X.E drives are beautiful and look breath taking. The game also spices it up with a consistant amount of humour that some may find annoying, I usually ignore the humour but sometimes i do get quite a kick out of them, such as Uni's Charley Horse ability (Plus it's damn hot <3)\n\nOverall this game is fun, time consuming, and most importantly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FUN! For anyone who has previously played a Hyperdimension Game this is an instant buy\n\nMy final score for Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 2 is a : 9/10 This game is amazing engaging and never lets the pace down, and if you have the money lying around this is definetely worth a buy! I can't wait to see more ports from the PsVita to steam of the Hyperdimension Franchise!","June 10, 2015","true","13.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This is more, but this is Nepgears time to shine, good ol' Nepgear gets to become a main character instead of Nep-Nep herself, and combined with the other CPU Candidates makes for a pretty entertaining story, stil containing tons of references, collectables, clothes for your characters, combos, the whole lot, now with Stella's Dungeon, Enjoy that. With many new characters not in the first game, you get to experience meeting them and learning about them, Overall, Still as fun and entertaining as the first game and of course, if you enjoyed the first game, you'll probably enjoy this, unless you don't like Nepgear?!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SmartsSH/recommended/351710/","SmartsSH","Smarts","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SmartsSH/","107 products in account","For the following review, I will be referring to Re;Birth1 and Re;Birth2 as RB1 and RB2.\n\nIn terms of story, I feel RB2's is much better than RB1's. RB1 I would consider a happy go lucky adventure, although it did have its moments. RB2 on the other hand, it felt darker. Don't get me wrong, there were a fair share of silly moments, but the game did have more dark and emotional moments than RB1. I felt more engaged in this story. I wanted to see what happens next. It had me hooked, and I love games that do that.\n\nThe protagonist this time around is Nepgear, Neptune's younger sister. While some don't like her, I actually find her to be a good lead character. She's a shy girl with confidence issues who has a heavy burden placed on her shoulders. Actually, all the candidates have some kind of issue that plagues them. In my opinion, this makes them all the more relatable and likeable. You want to see these girls overcome their fears.\n\nFor gameplay, it's pretty much the same as RB1's but with some changes. The first and most noticeable change is that you can have a party of four now. That right there is a simple change, but a much welcomed change. Having a four person party really opens up the floodgates for potential strategies. Another thing I like is that human characters feel more useful now. In RB1, I would mainly just stick with CPUs because I felt the human characters were a bit too weak for my liking. In RB2, I find more human characters on my team now. They feel stronger than they were previously, and some are just outright awesome (Cave). Finally, this is a bit difficult to explain, but I find this game to be more balanced. I don't feel that it throws any curve balls at the player in terms of difficulty. The difficulty itself seems to progress with the player.\n\nNext up is the soundtrack, which to me is really good. From the relaxing tunes of the resort and forest levels to the upbeat tunes of the CFW and normal battle music. It's all great and worth listening to.\n\nGraphics are as colorful and organic as ever.\n\nThis game is worth every penny.","June 12, 2015","true","36.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Just click 'add to cart' already dude\n\nPros :\n- All aspects in Neptunia Re;Birth1\n- 1 More slot party, make your team more overwhelm the enemy (LoL)\n- New Minigame, even i don't know which use of this minigame except for Medal (maybe will give you great plan later?)\n- Nepgear there\n- I said nepgear there? yeah nepgear there\n- Once again nepgear there\n\nCons :\n- I just wonder, why steam give free DLC for Nepgear weapon, it will ruin starting game if you use that.\nI mean without that, this game pretty much easy rather than RB1 (Maybe you should activate Fortify Enemy)\n- The joke sometimes seems off (i love how neptune and noire back then at RB1, or with blanc and vert). Thanks to puchiko for her nyu.\n- I just annoying how the story can be different or not connected with Re;Birth1, for example when first time Neptune meet Compa and IF for first time.

Having said that also, the game is from japen, so some scenes might seem alittle strange For example, one of the Main Villians wanting to Marry two of the Youngest Sisters, and i mean young!  And there is a groping scene where our party gets attacked by goodogs.  And of course there is the Hot springs scene too.\n\nVoice acting is top notice, but the characters avatar, doesnt lip sync well, And there is a huge lack of cutscenes Due to the game starting on psVita i believe most Cutsences are in Pictures, with "Jiggle" around\n\nThere is also a mini game "Stellas dungeon" where you send a npc off, to dungeon crawl, dungeons you done before to find you gear, and treasures but at later stages it gets super hard (specially the last when the floor 1000 boss can crit for 9999 damage!)\n\nAnother Aspect of the game is the "Plans" part, this will allow you to make certain things, if you have the Materials such as Weapons, Armor, Outfits for the girls, Bonous to xp, credit drop weaker monsters.  And the best part, Gain plans that will Add Dungeosn, Make Dungeosn Tougher, Drop different loot from Gather nodes, Or even Replace all monsters with super buffed monsters, This being useful for people who do "Newgame+" alot, since some dungeons even at level 400 take forever to kill a mob with the best gear!\n\nOverall, I bought this game on a whim, and didnt regreat one moment of it.  Its a fantasic game, with good game play, Voice acting, Visuals, story And replyablity.  And with the third game going to steam, in the fall of 2015 Im looking super exicted!\n\nI recommand this game to anyone who loves JPGS but also recommand you look up some guides for the best ending the "True ending" There is guides for all the endings that people posted here\n\nAnd as i said The "Conquest" ending, is a real heart breaking and super depressing so best to get that out the way!..\n\nThe DLC also helps ALOT so i recommand that also!\n\nGreat game and has earned a loyal fan from me!","July 12, 2015","true","82.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

An event in chap3 gets the first meeting of Compa, IF, Nepear and Neptune COMPLETELY wrong!)\n\nThe story:\nIN MY EYES Nepgear doesn't fit a protagonist, she is so whiney that dialogues often get a drag to read, opposed to the fun conversations of the first part. Overall the story itself feels worse and and overall lacks effort, the Team-Rocket-esque antagonists don't help....\n\n\nConclusion:\nOverall good gameplay - like Rebirth 1 had.\nHowever, if you played Re;birth 1 you might as well replay it.\nPlayers who are new to the franchise should definitely purchase Re;birth 1 instead.","July 17, 2015","false","30.7"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","1"

This remastered version, which was optimised for the PS Vita portable platform, is definitely an inferior version to the original game, with less movies than in the PS3 version and the lack of the Keiji Inafune's cameos (and subsequently the lack of the infamous Inafune sword and beam attacks for NepGear). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXAl8skbocQ\n\nThe replacement of NISA and Gust with RED and Broccoli, while seamless, also removed a couple of coupled EX skills that are apparently not replaced. Personally, I'm still quite sad to get no prinny and atelier references without the two companies.\n\nNegativity aside, Neptunia Re;Birth 2 is still a pretty good game game filled with comedic moments. The story remain true to the original game, which still make it the best of the series IMO. Definitely a must-play if you'd always wanted to experience the craziness in a light-hearted JRPG.","May 29, 2015","true","15.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

This means that if you haven't already played the prequel to this game, you might find yourself a bit confused on who is who and what the setting of this story is. So before you even bother to play this game, please do yourself a favor by playing the first to get a grasp of what kind of a world you are getting yourself into. But lets be serious... the only reason you should be getting this game in the first place is because you've played the first game.\n\nLet's assume you've played the first game and have seen everything the first game has had to offer... This game has absolutely nothing new to offer besides a few new characters and a slightly different storyline compared to the first game. Gameplay is completely the same, except you can have 4 people on the field instead of 3. Only reason you should be getting this game is because you are a fan of the series. If you are actually buying this game because there may be new features and things to do, you are setting yourself up for disappointment. Only thing new here is probably Stella's dungeon, which is completely unentertaining and you'll probably just not bother with it at all, like me. Overall, everything felt recycled from the first game.\n\nIf you were a sucker for the CPU goddesses in the first game (Neptune, Noire, Vert, or Blanc), you will be highly disappointed because you will not be able to play them straight off the bat. In fact, the goddesses have to be unlocked through achievements and only during a certain chapter onwards will you get to lay your hands on them for the first time. Instead you'll be mostly playing as Nepgear, the new protagonist, for a large majority of the storyline until you unlock more characters.\n\nNew characters don't have as much of an impact compared to the characters you were introduced to in the first game. So you'll probably find it a lot harder to grow attached to the newer characters (exception of maybe the CPU candidates). As with the first game, your main goals in this game are probably to complete as many achievements as possible and grind yourself to unlock plans and end-game/strong gear.\n\nTL;DR Really not much to say about this game... Nothing new, recycled features and content, more characters, mediocre storyline, and a trophy/achievement fest. Honestly preferred the first game over this one.\n\nRecommended only if you are a fan of the series. If you didn't like the first game, expecting new features, or are not a fan of the series, this game offers nothing new and you should turn away and spend money elsewhere.\n\nSide Note: Noire is best girl. This game needs more Noire.","June 19, 2015","false","33.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The map doesn't get nearly as obstructed when you start unlocking lots of new items and enemies. Some rudimentary materials such as Herb drop more often so you can actually finish your item plans before you stop needing them. Stella's Dungeon is a nice minigame and you can get useful items/materials that way too. You can put four girls on the field instead of three so you can actually have all four goddesses/candidates out at the same time.\n\nThe most common problem people are having is the game choking up whenever there's a Guard Break (multiple times per battle), which destroys your framerate for 1-5 seconds. I'm expecting this to be fixed soon.\n\nEnglish voices are hilariously bad, Japanese voices are hilariously good. The translation has some glaring localization issues.\n\nRB2 is quite easy (perhaps a bit harder than RB1) so I recommend you dont use all those broken items and plans you get right at the start. The game has been very enjoyable so far.","June 4, 2015","true","19.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The characters are really incredible voices are really great but its a bit appreciated for the Lip synching to be worked on. The jokes they make is really great but if you turn on the japanese translations the jokes will feel dull unless if you actually understood Japanese. Locations and the whole world have been improved and now looks better than rebirth 1.The combat itself is really great it is a bit repetitive but it removes the repetitiveness because you can edit your combos. The story can get you confused however because of what happened in Rebirth one at the beginning it has you saying "huh?" its like the world in rebirth 2 is completely different from rebirth 1 I dunno. Overall its a really great game, great voice acting but bad lip synching, great music, incredible looking world but dungeuon designs are almost the same, great combat, great characters but some are confusing and the endings are great but in how you get those endings are a bit confusing because you have no idea that you were contributing to a bad end or a good end because of the littlest things you do can contribute to bad or good endings like hearing a rumor that a sword can get more powerful the more you kill godesses something like that.\n\n\n\nLittle spoilers below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning: Save first before you go to an event and choose if whether or not you want to advance after seeing that event.","June 4, 2015","true","26.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dichotomication/recommended/351710/","dichotomication","Dicher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dichotomication/","264 products in account","I'm quite a fan of the franchise but Neptunia Rebirth 2 is something that I cannot recommend as much I wanted to love this game. Some technical problems, unecessary gameplay additions, and boring story is what makes this game falls short compared to its predecessor.\n\nIt's the same game as the previous installment with only minor additions. But that very minor additions is what makes the game worse than it predecessor, at least if you're aiming to get all achievements. Take, for example, stella's dungeon. It's suppossed to be some kind of 'passive income' since stella does net you some plan materials but it's just not worth it in my opinion as it adds almost nothing to the gameplay. Hell, it can be ignored altogether and i think no one will miss a thing. And on top of that the achievement for it feels like a test of patience, and it's even worse if you don't have the dlc. Other than stella's dungeon there's one more addition of character slot for battle and i guess that's nice for anyone who wants to see more imoutos on action. Everything else, gameplay wise, is pretty much the same.\n\nMoving on, let's talk about technical problems, i've heard some people having crash and/or black screen problem but personally i've never encountered such problems. I don't know if it's already been fixed or not but still, if you're going to pick this up, take cautions. Another thing to note is that the optimization is worse compared to Rebirth 1. Everytime I broke the enemy guard, the framerate will drop from ~50fps to ~22fps though only for a brief period. It's not game breaking, but definitely jarring. General performance also feels worse, I got mostly around 50fps and that's with a GTX 970. In Rebirth 1 it's almost constant 60fps even when I was still using the older GTX 760. I'm not trying to be a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ but the fact that Rebirth 1 doesn't have this problem at all is what baffles me considering both games are probably running on the exact same engine and assets.\n\nNext, we have the story. To be honest, I think Nepgear just doesn't cut to be a protagonist. Don't get me wrong, I think she's cute, has okay personality, and great voice actors both for the japanese and the english version. I even liked her more compared to Neptune. But I think her personality is the problem. She's like...I don't know how to describe it accurately but I think it's righteous? Let's just say she's generally helping and a nice girl who admires her sister. I mean it's fine when she's the supporting character but when it's her as the main character it feels generic and doesn't match up with the series' tone.\n\nAnd this is the part which I have the most problems about. Character interactions in the story is basically everyone talking about or with Nepgear, how nice she is, how mature she is, and all that thing. There's little interaction between everyone else, so much so that Nepgear is the only one that actually got character developments. All of that made worse by the repetitive bgm. Some bgm is just so overused that it lost the ability to emphasize the situation. It frustrates me so much when someone is sad or get motivated and I already know what kind of tune will be played. All that brought the end result that is a predictable and lifeless story.\n\nAnd finally, the usual branching ending route. If you look at the achievements, there seems to be nine endings but it's actually just three endings that of normal, true, and conquest ending with leanbox, planeptune, lastation, lowee, and human ending just as some kind of prologue to the normal ending and holy sword ending being a slightly different version of true ending. Mind you, each nine ending has the share requirements that takes some grinding but the holy sword ending requires you to also have good lily ranks which will have you to grind even more. It's a tedious and boring process to get all of the endings. Adding to the fact that conquest ending is a really sad and dark one which is something unexpected for the franchise. I mean it's nice to have some twist to the story, even more so for a game with a catchy and playful tone like this one. It's just kinda unfair for Nepgear to be treated that way even if it's not the canon ending. In actuality I know this is not something to complain about. I was just kinda devastated when I saw the ending that's all.\n\nTo sum it up, I think Rebirth 2 is not a worthy successor to Rebirth 1. It's more grindy than already grindy Rebirth 1, it has technical problems that Rebirth 1 doesn't have, and the story is just...sad, both literally and figuratively. Even Nepgear got bullied in rebirth 3 for being a protagonist. If you're looking for more nepnep, I recommend to skip this one and go straight for Rebirth 3. It has some genuine improvements both from the technical, mechanical, and storytelling perspective and definitely my favorite one.","January 11","false","75.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","3"

You can read all the positive aspects of the game elswhere, I'll just list all the problems I found. (Some of the next ramblings are a little older)\n\nTHIS WAS WRITTEN ON DIFFERENT FORUMS, SO IT MAY BE WORDED ODDLY!\n\nOk, I don't quite agree with the people above me.\nNepgear being an awful character is more about personal opinions and assumptions, she's just more like an angsty kid instead of the cheerful and random Neptune (which I liked a lot more too).\n\nThe game feels a lot less polished than one, there are apparently a lot of crash issues, which I haven't encountered yet because I applied the fixes preemptively. Then there's the guard-break lag, every time you break the guard of an enemy the game lags for a second or two, no know fix for this. At the start of every level the game lags because it's loading all the monsters at once, even if you can't see them (including overlapping spawn sound). I'm only 5 hours into the game and I am already asking myself why I'm not just playing the Rebirth1 endgame and the only answer I have is "maybe it'll get better".  (And it did, a little bit. Chapter two is just very badly paced)\n\nThe quests so far seem boring, instead giving you renamed dungeons with new monsters in 'em they make you visit old dungeons which you may have out-leveled by then. Furthermore The balance seems to be all out of whack in comparison to the first one. I'm level 30 currently and Red (The first character you acquire) constantly hits the damage-cap with her Skill and her other abilities (AOE-heal and strength buff) are great too, couples with little SP cost and then there's IF little SP, few not very effective AOE spells that cost a ton of SP and terrible defenses, making here very susceptible to being one/two-shot.\n\nContinuing on, the story at the start (please don't forget I'm only 5 hours in) is terrible. You try to ask some things for help and then there's this "Underling" who always one-ups you whilst losing, even worse than Afiore in my opinion. She at least always destroyed you, the Underling just seems to have a plot-armor.\n(More complaints)\nT̶h̶e̶ ̶s̶t̶o̶r̶y̶ ̶a̶l̶s̶o̶ ̶s̶e̶e̶m̶s̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶g̶e̶t̶ ̶c̶h̶a̶r̶a̶c̶t̶e̶r̶s̶ ̶f̶r̶o̶m̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶l̶a̶s̶t̶ ̶g̶a̶m̶e̶,̶ ̶I̶F̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶C̶o̶m̶p̶a̶ ̶m̶e̶e̶t̶ ̶F̶a̶l̶c̶o̶m̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶P̶u̶c̶h̶i̶k̶o̶/̶B̶r̶o̶c̶c̶o̶l̶i̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶d̶o̶n̶'̶t̶ ̶r̶e̶c̶o̶g̶n̶i̶z̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶m̶ ̶a̶t̶ ̶a̶l̶l̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶y̶ ̶j̶u̶s̶t̶ ̶r̶e̶i̶n̶t̶r̶o̶d̶u̶c̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶m̶s̶e̶l̶v̶e̶s̶ ̶a̶s̶ ̶i̶f̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶y̶ ̶n̶e̶v̶e̶r̶ ̶m̶e̶t̶ ̶b̶e̶f̶o̶r̶e̶.̶   (Alternate Universe)\n\nI could ramble on and one and on about it, but to sum it up, I've played through HDN R1, got the true ending and wanted to see how they continued and expected the same game with a new story (since they came out only one year apart, not enough time to create a whole new game) and what I'm getting so far is a worse and unpolished version.\n\nI'll write some more when I'm about 10-15 hours in, so far I'm not very happy with the sequel.\n\nEDIT: Oh I hope you liked the five times recycled factory from Rebirth 1, you'll get some more of 'em. In addition to that you'll get your all-time favorite enemy the Killing Machine again... and again and again and again, because everybody loves the generic and often-times reused robot boss, that's still as boring as he was in the first game.\n\nEDIT 2: I guess I forgot to mention that one of the reasons I say this feels unpolished is because the UI seems to look worse too, in addition to the amalgamation of other problems.\n\nEDIT 3: Oh, I nearly forgot the dungeons, they're all bigger, bigger platforms, broader pathways, etc... Problem is, they look ever worse, much less effort was put into them and they're pretty empty, because the amount of enemies remains the same as in Rebirth 1, additionally this makes Hidden-treasure hunting a pain in the ♥♥♥, because there's more space\n\nEDIT 4: Oh I just saw that you only asked about the battle system, it's pretty much the same, other than four characters there' not much to it. Exe rush seems a little ineffective (5 hours in) and my characters haven't learned their exe-drives at level 30 yet. Previous mentioned things about balance of certain attacks is still in effect. I find myself skipping guard break moves, since most mobs die before you empty their gauge, my main damage source is flanking the enemy and then unleashing a Mirage dance and Red's skill on it. Deals consistent 12K damage to my all-time favorite boss the Killing Machine anyways.\n\n\nI guess I'm on a roll now, last message didn't have any characters to spare.\nHere's more:\nThey significantly upped the amount of small talks (Like the Ms.Manual events on the chirper(?)), you essentially get 50 of those every time you complete a part of the story and only about 5% of those talks give you an item or item plan. Meaning you have to go through all fifty three-sentence pop-ups to get about 2-3 item-plans. Most of the dialogue is boring as hell too.\n\nEDIT 1: Don't want to count too high now. I'm only saying this because I want to give the best possible outline of the laziness in this game, if you want to hear all of the story voice-acted, you're out of luck. They voice-acted most of the story in Japanese (have come across about 10 dialogue frames that weren't voiced in 5 hours) and I've read that if you play with English voice-overs you get even more unvoiced main-story. Furthermore, costumes that were in Rebirth 1 haven't been ported over like all the stages and enemy models, some characters (Like the first character you acquire) don't get any outfits.\n\n\n\nI can't quite agree to that, better story? I can see why you would say that, actually I could agree to that... IF ignoring that your MC can be summed up with "I...I...I need to get stronger" or "I...I...I was not strong enough *sniffle*".\n\n"better villians" I cannot fathom what has made you write that, the main villian is an androgynus girl that dresses in a black hoodie, shorts and uses a lead pipe as weapon, additionally her only real villian quality is that she calls the cast "broads" and ... does stuff that always fails, she reminds me of Team Rocket only far less likeable. She never get's caught, always runs away and throws you some recycled boss fight in the face and talks big after that. Don't even get me started on that friggin' rat that's obsessed with Compa.\n\nThe only good villian in the true ending was CFW Brave, he was quite a nice guy, a gentleman if you will. He had a motive and didn't run away when beaten (Well let's ignore the first fight, he didn't really run).\n\nAnd then there's CFW Pedophile that wants to lick Ram and Rom and CFW Plot Armor that somwhow beats all goddeses at the start and then get's easily owned at the end with no apparent reason. Oh and what happens after you beat her... welp, didn't she have a great roll in the story >.>\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked the first game and want less polished more of the same, then by all means, buy it.\n\nAfter 18 hours of this game I went back to Re;Brith 1 to 100% it, was much more enjoyable.","July 9, 2015","false","17.5"," 13 of 29 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","13","29","0","13"

So similiar, yet with some minor differences.\nI'll be honest, Re;birth 2 is very similiar to the first game of the franchise, the gameplay system\nis pretty much the same. But on the other hand the main character cast gets flipped - main four this time around consists of 4 very  very  underraged girls.\n\nThe story is a tad more complex. Though it still retains it's sillyness with huge amounts of video game references and other fun stuff, this time around the game has more than 3 different endings.(While grinding for them may sadly feel like a chore, it can be worth it).\nGraphics remain the same colourful anime-ish as before, and the Music/Sounds mostly remain the same as in the previous game with some additions.\n\nAnd now to highlight the good and bad parts:\n\nPros\n(?) Main characters are Loli (Cute and very young petite anime girls)\nSlightly deeper, yet still light and fun story (More endings too)\nWhile grinding is still here, it's not as gruelling. (the game is bundled with free DLC that\nallows the player to more easily level-up if he wishes to do so.)\nSimiliary with farming, there are few ways in the game that allow easier farming such as\nrandom encounter insta-kill.\nThe game's a JRPG with fun combat elements\nLily system - bonding with teammates now has a purpose (more or less) in this game!\nCons\nThe amount of items you can create is massive and will require multiple game completions\nto fully create all of them. That also means spending time farming all the materials.\nRich story lovers may be dissapointed with the game's story, if they are looking for\nsomething deep and strong.\nJust like with the previous game, there are various monster and dungeon assets re-used.\nWithout researching online it's almost impossible to know how to get different endings\nin the game, which some will want to do to fully beat the game.\nA very similiar gameplay to the first HNRe;birth1.\nTo nitpick: The overworld background music is obnoxiously louder than all the other BGMs\nwhich may cause serious hate against this particular one after long gameplay hours.\nAnd also not all of the main character costumes were imported into this game. Kind of weird.\nTo summarise, Re;birth2 is certainly not a direct clone of the first game, but it is quite similiar in many aspects.\nEven so, the fans of the franchise will certainly find something to love in this game. If you weren't turned-off by the game's bad points, or if you haven't experienced Neptunia before and want to start with  young  protagonists - by all means, try it out. Sadly, if a friend asked whether I'd recommend to play this as a sequel to Re;birth1, I would have to say - no. So bear that in mind when buying.","October 3, 2015","false","63.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I hardly finish any game nowaday but I completly breezed through the 1st game in less than a week, Been a while since I had this much fun playing a game.\n\nHowever this game disapointed me. To me it's not even a 2 it's basically a DLC of the first game because the battle system is literally the same... and battles are like 85% of the game. I loved the combat system but at the end of the 1st, the combat was getting old due to the fact that it's fairly easy, simple and repetitive. The battle system could've used some polishing but they didn't bother making any change at all.\n\nEven though the story isn't the same and there's new characters, you will feel like you're redoing the same game over again. Maybe due to the fact that a lot of enemies are similar and even some dungeons are copied from the first game. The  guild / store / equipement are also the same for the most part and even the map feel like the same.\n\nIt feels lazy and rushed to be honest.

Such as aesthetics, and some gameplay tweeks. I played re;birth one on vita and I have to say, I love the art. Looks so good at 1080p. I love how quick the menus are.\n\nHowever, this port is poorly optimized. I've ran games such as Sonic Generations at max 1080p 60fps with no hiccups. That game has more texture detail and over all more going on with it thann this game.\n\nThis game chugs and becomes choppy consistantly.\n\nI also am disappointed to see the continuation of re-used content. Dungeon layouts are copy pasted from the first game, and this game has several dungeons that are duplicates with different enemies.\n\nThe story once again is not deep or meaningful. It's a ligh hearted adventure with references and fanservice. If you are into that, cool. I'm pretty ok with it. COMPA BEST GIRL.\n\nBattle system is still good, with the added 4th character it becomes very chaotic, in a good way.\n\nIt's an average game, I hear V-Generation is better so I'll get that sometime.\n\nIf you're into this type of game get it.

Because JRPGs are not games in the proper sense of the word, a JRPG sinks or swims on the quality of its main cast as charismatic characters, and this game has no single character I could root for. Neptunia's formula was an "Abbot&Costello" thing, and without Neptune to act as the Costello to everyone else's abbot, you end up with a cast of:\n\n1) Awkward teen.\n2) Wangsty teen.\n3) Unsufferable brats.\n4) Muggle supporting cast.\n\nNot only none of them have enough redeeming quailties to hold the narrative's weight, as a formula, the team isn't funny, period. The comedy was stale, and Neptune arrived much too late to rescue the act.\n\nNow, for the second problem. While the previous Neptunia game was already a "Nintendo Power game" (i.e a game you forcefully require an internet guide to finish to completion, because the Japanese are stuck in the 80's and they still think it's cool to "earn your fun" and trial-and-error everything, but back to the point...), there's a big difference between a game withholding bells and whistles without a guide, and the game denying you ACTUAL CONTENT without a guide, and unless you do a -very specific- set of things you can easily miss out, the game denies you the last two chapters, which is BS and sapped me of any enthusiasm to even try a replay.\n\nI really hope Rebirth 3 does better than this.\n\nTL;DR: Don't waste your time and money here, the series follows no continuity so you can go straight for Rebirth 3 and you'll have missed nothing.","July 12, 2015","false","118.3"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","2"

I bought this game because I thought I would rather enjoy a new story than grinding my way to lv.999. How wrong I was.\n\nI have to say that the story sucks. It's more like watching kids arguing with each other. Boss battles are of the same pattern. They try to dramatize the plot, but that fails miserably so far.\n\nThe worst of all, these sisters are annoying. Nepgear lacks confidence and humor. Uni is downright irritating. She's a Tsundere like Noire, but wayyyy too much Tsundere on a not-cute side. Rom and Ram are, well, just a shy and a trolling kid. I was thinking about dropping the game half-way until CPUs were rescued. Suddenly, the game has some good ol' LoLs from Neptune and friends.\n\nNow that I have Neptune, Noire, Vert, and Blanc back in the game, I guess I can pull through the end. But if you have played Re;Birth 1, I recommend you stay clear from this one. Just wait for Re;Birth 3 or do something else.

The previous game was amazing and I had huge hopes for this one. However, it crashes like crazy and the manual fixes are hit-or-miss at best. Consider yourself blessed if the game works for you at all without needing to fix the major crashes many of us are experiencing. The cutscenes are glitchy and the FPS is ridiculously unstable in dungeons and battles, jumping around randomly for no reason that I can discern. My computer more than meets the recommended requirements, yet it feels like I'm trying to run it on a low end laptop. This port was very lazily executed and I can't honestly recommend the game until it has had some work done, in which case I will gladly change my review. I think it's terrible that so many people are giving the game a positive review over trivial things like cute characters when that's only going to make the developers think not as much work will need to be done. They'd be far more likely to work on making it playable more quickly if the reviews actually reflected how playable the game is.","May 31, 2015","false","23.7"," 18 of 50 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","18","50","0","3"

It just shows that I'm right.\n\nWhy this game is overrated\n\n- Half of the dungeons are low level copies of the original ones in Neptunia 1. Recycled maps would retain their quality with some differences here and there, but none of it remains here, and the rest are just no fun either. Some of them are plain painful to even look at.\n- The Lowee Expo stage flatout looks like it was modeled after an industrial deep freeze storage room with only the pieces of meat missing from the ceiling. Just what kind of level designer would come up with something like that?\n- Over half of the cast have no craftable outfits at all, which is just unacceptable. What's the point of having innumerable accessories if there's nothing to put them on with?\n- Many of them fall short on damage later on from not having good equipment, and sometimes mechanic, which makes otherwise awesome EXE Drives worthless in Colosseum fights.\n- Falcom's character redesign is just awful.\n- Share juggling is a blatant waste of time, as acquiring the required amount at least eight times is incredibly tedious, and is only there for the sake of grinding, since the so called ending aren't really endings at all. They are only extra scenes at most and not very good ones at that, not explaining the time and effort demanded to see them.\n- Conquest ending. Enough said.\n- The whole story is not even close to what it was like in terms of entertainment to the previous installment.\n- The music tracks which had a huge part in making the gameplay fun in Neptunia 1 was replaced with awful tracks, to the point where you wouldn't even notice if you turned it completely off.\n- Red is so annoying, she should be an enemy, not a playable character.\n- Stella's Dungeon is a nice minigame, but making something you have so little control of into an achivement is a messed up move, because even if it runs in the background, it takes days in itself to complete and that's if she succeeds in exploring on her first try. If not, you'll have to send her in until she does.\n- Translation quality shows up again, taking quite some liberty at localizing the original text since you can understand at a glance that what the girls are saying and what you are reading are often very different. Sometimes entire lines get added or removed, which is anything but acceptable.\n\nWhy this game is fun\n\n- Cave\n\nAs you can see, there are plenty of reasons not to buy this game at full price, only when it's on sale.\n\nEDIT: Downvotes from fanboys and trolls don't mean anything to me if they won't even try to say why they didn't agree with me.","May 4","false","69.6"," 1 of 14 people (7%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","7","1","14","0","0"

Then, I walk through some dungeon and fight a boss. I've done this about 15 times. Where I'm at in the game there still isn't any customization to do. There isn't really any dungeon exploring, you just go from A -> B, engaging enemies if you feel like it. The combat feels pointless and repetative. The quests are just kill enemy x number of time or collect x of this item.\n\nI've liked games like Final Fantasy 1, 10, 12, Tactics Advanced, and Makai Kingdoms.\n\nThis game reminds me a lot of the Xenosaga series, which I didn't particularly like, but I don't remember Xenosaga being as terrible as Hyper Dimension Neptunia. And that is coming from someone who will acknowledge the cast cuteness/hotness of HDN > KOSMOS.\n\nMaybe people would buy this game instead of torrenting it (and I wouldn't have to listen some passive aggressive story about torrenting) if the game actually had real redeaming qualities aside from anime jiggle.

Nope it's practically the same as the last one. I actually can't stand playing it because I feel like I lost all my stuff from last game by starting a new save. You can hunt me down and dislike this review but seriously, this is the equivelent to a DLC, it's a continuation to the story but the gameplay is the same, the mechanics are almost identical, the only difference is really the HUD and a few little things on the side that really can't make enough of a difference for me to enjoy this and see it as a new game. I haven't played this enough to experience crashes because I just wasn't enjoying how  blatantly copy and pasted it is.\nThe only real improvement I have seen is the background looks a lot more lush and creative along with the map.\nThe story as you can guess I haven't seen much of but I am terribley bored with Nepgear I much rather prefer Nep.\nIf you liked and want a game that plays identically to the first this game is perfect for you but otherwise it's just same game a little increase on background textures and some new characters.\nIf you are looking for big changes in gameplay so far I haven't found anything and haven't heard anything about big gameplay changing overhauls or changes.","June 1, 2015","false","0.7"," 9 of 43 people (21%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","21","9","43","3","7"

This game looks awesome. It looks grand, big, full of wonderfully made imagery and overall, a fun game to play, but it's just the technical aspects that really do my head it.\nI'm a cut-scene kinda guy, and enjoy watching what goes on in between the gameplay, and the main problem for me is that it's stuttering is pretty bad. By that I mean, the audio continues while the video stops, they both stop momentarily and try to catch up to each other, and it's not just the cut-scenes. Even the opening credits has this problem! Throughout the 5 minutes I've played this, I've noticed this is a constant issue, and I hope it'll be addressed soon.\nJust fix this one tiny problem, and I can get around to enjoying this game in whatever way I intend to.\nAlso, the voice acting is alright, but during the first fight scene, the actresses sound like they weren't putting much effort into it. The grunting sounds during the fight scenes sound half-♥♥♥♥♥, and when the girl notices her friends have been knocked out, she brings this point forth in a somewhat confused tone with some quick breath, rather then actual sadness and fear that her allies have fallen in battle, and now she's facing a demon by herself. I know you won't fix the voice, but next time, try and get your actors to emote more. That can impact the characters in a huge way if done right or wrong.

I don't like visual novels.\n\nThis is a visual novel JRPG... thing. I love it. Why? The characters are relatable because you have to live through their struggles with them as your proxy. But why is the gameplay tolerable?\n\nWell...\n\nThere's a sword in the DLC that totally destroys the progression curve in the game, and its ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic. No, seriously. I'm not kidding. I'm a gamer of two realms, one of action and one of story. I like multiplayer competitive games such as World of tanks, and story-driven games like Bioshock and System Shock 2. Grinding for hours and hours on end isn't something I have time for.\n\nVery minor spoilers ahead, stuff you'll see in the first five minutes:\n\nThat DLC sword cut the entirety of the game's grindtastic feel out, made me feel like a baddass and I roleplayed (ACTUALLY ROLEPLAYED) as NepGear, the protagonist, being actually powerful enough to take on the big bad from the get-go, but she didn't have the confidence.\n\nThis actually plugs up a few plot holes, such as why NepGear was the only one to go with the other main CPU goddesses to fight the big bad in the first place. The very first cutscene in the game shows the main CPU characters being stomped into the dirt when you (probably) spent the entirety of the last game, which took me 50~ ish hours to complete. Most of that was boring slog grinding.\n\nOne has to assume that battle-hardened warriors wouldn't take a squishy newbie into such a critical battle, so therefore she must have been talented enough to risk taking her to the big bad fight. No, you can't say that it was for a numbers advantage, because they didn't take the other CPU canidates.\n\nIts also worth noting that litteral goddesses should be able to outright crush low-level monsters and people with minimal effort, delegating other characters to support roles.\n\nThis is the first time I've ever seen DLC improve a game in such a profound manner.\n\n10/10, would pay2win again.","November 2, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, occasional fanservice, yuri, ecchi and just general lewd jokes.\nLook, the game is great. I love it. I recommend anyone who enjoys RPG's and anime to buy it.\nIs the price fair? Probably not. It's a tad more expensive than I'd like it to be. It should be around 20€, maybe even as low as 15€. Why?\n\nAlright, time to point out the game's flaws. (Or rather, Re;Birth1's flaws, since, I didn't buy the game, so I can't review Re;Birth1 here on steam. But! I digress. Re;Birth2 doesn't seem too obviously different it's predecessor, so, I'll base this review on my experience with that game. If I notice that the sequel is any different once I progress further, than I shall come at a later time and edit this review.)\n\nHyperdimension Neptunia (Which I will now begin calling HDN, or, jokingly, HDTuna for shortnening reasons) is, like I said, great. But I, on many instances, felt bored when playing it. Bored, and annoyed. Why?\nFirst of all, the "Information" system. Y'know, the one where you have to go to the map and either select the message pop-up on the map or select a world and read through every single bit of "information" everyone has to offer. Seems simple, right?\nWRONG.\nThere are people that give you items to alter the way dungeons work (The so-called Plans, and the remake system). And, at the beginning, it's all fun and simple, the game is slow-paced, so, we're not encountering too many dungeons to which we could have those plans.\nThen you get to the late game. AKA, the "5 dungeons per story-related-action" area. And the "Here's 50 people offering NEW dungeons other than the story-related ones" area. Now, you get 2 plans for each dungeon. One for changing the items in it, the other for making enemies stronger. Let's multiply that 2 with the theoretical 15, assuming I progressed a bit in the story without pauses. Now let's sum the result of that, with the product of multiplying 50 with 2. So, (15*2)+(50*2)= 130.\n\nOne hundred and thirty.\nOne hundred and thirty people you have to talk to just to get that obnoxious "NEW!" message to stop appearing on every world.\nOne hundred and thirty LONGER-THAN-NEEDED chats with IRRELEVANT-TO-STORY characters.\n\nBut, that isn't even my biggest peeve with HDTuna. From my experience in the first game, enemies scale HORRIBLY. And I mean, HORRIBLY\nI died on the second dungeon, from a normal ghost enemy. And I had no idea that I would. After all, I was pretty much gliding through the enemies in the first dungeon.\nThen we have the "semi-bosses". The orange icons you encounter on pretty much every area in the late-game. These guys should be easier than the main bosses in that area, so, these guys are here basically just for me to grind, right? WRONG!\nI have had to re-do half an hour worth of gameplay due to making the mistake that semi-bosses would be easier than the boss itself. I had already defeated the boss in the area, and thought "Y'know what let's go ahead and defeat this dude. I'm sure after that boss, it won't be that hard."\nIt was.\nIt almost one-shot me after I did close to 0 damage to it due to it regenerating health every turn. And this is WITHOUT the "tough enemies" plan you can make after gathering certain items.\n\nSpeaking of making and gathering, the remake system in the game is kind of extremely annoying. The ammount of items and dungeons and plans you can make/get, make the list GIGANTIC, almost IMPOSSIBLE to even memorise, and some even ask you for items you couldn't get until much later in the game, when that ornament you wanted to make with said item is obsolete due to one you bought. It'd FEEL more worth it if the developers had let us known the actual stats and usages of the weapons/items/armour/et cetera. That way we'd know if the investment of time to grind for the items would be worth it. But instead we get what I can only describe as an unboxing simulator due to the nature of unknowing what we'll get.\n\nBut, I'm nitpicking.\nI really am.\nBecause, if you exclude the one or two times where the things I mentioned above actually HINDER you progress, the game really is fun to play.\nIt had me actually laugh to one or two jokes the writers slipped in, it has tasty references, and the characters are adorable and lovable.\nFor the price I paid for it (14€ + an extra 1 or 2 € for the helpful, but not needed AT ALL DLC), it's well worth your money. The trading cards alone made me my money back once I got foil cards on all the 4 drops (each card sold for 3€, holy guacamole). For the full price?... Maybe not so much. If you want to give it a shot, by all means.\n\nI give this game 4/5 tacos, with a side-dish of tortillas.","June 6, 2015","true","40.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The rules and craft and boss fight is also still the same.\nWhat to be highlighted is there's a bug in the game that is sound and crash issue.\nI can only help on 1 part that is the crash issue during starting the game, that is by not skipping until you were directed to the main page (new game, continue, dlc, option n etc.). I didn't across any other crashes other than the opening part.\nAs for another one is, sound problem. Supposely, all the dialog and event conversation, there should be voiced by the character. But, sometime it didn't work out as if its mute. In awhile its is back to normal, then it happens again.\nThus, for those who are kinda down about it, I advice don't worry about it. Its kinda normal for japanese game being christianed, and these kind of problems occurs. Sooner or later, there's gonna be a patch for it and yes it is still new on Steam.

This game turns to the CPU candidates as your main characters.  It is about 60% dialogue, 40% playing. Nothing new from the first Neptunia but those starting their Neptunia journey with this one should be aware it is a visual novel / turn based game mix. It contains a bunch of comedy and parodies throughout. It is fun while it lasts and enjoyable to an anime fan so if you liked the first, get this one. There is not a lot to this game to point out for positive points because it has two simple concepts and a basic story, nothing unique aside from the anime game style. It is good and you are either a fan of Neptunia series or aren't.\n\nThis one is Shorter than the first and has only half the dungeons approximately howerver. Those who liked the CPU's may feel unhappy if they can't appreciate the younger sisters taking the lead. The game feels a lot easier than the first was with much less grind time needed. It seems like there was a lack of thought as a large chunk of the game turns out to be fighting the same person over and over and over.......This becomes quite dissapointing as there really is no creativity or much change to the battles aside from extra stats. Balance becomes questionable at points where you fight one battle with little difficulty then the follow-up is hard and losing means having potentially wasted 20+ mins on the previous fight.\n\nThe character "Red" is rather annoying and her constantly talking about wifeys would have been best left out of the game. As mentioned in the review for the first Neptunia, trying to push same gender stuff heavily into peoples faces is a really poor choice. This type of material should be left minimal as 75% of people are not truely supportive of such concepts. It would be fine had it been mentioned maybe 2-3 times but it is really pushing it pointing it out at least 30+ times and that being the main dialogue she constantly throws into the game.\n\nPersonal experience score: 7.5/10\n\nStory: 8/10 - Pretty standard. Amusing and works for the series but nothing brand new.\nSound: 10/10 - Nice soundtrack actually. LAN Castle dungeon is the most epic\nGraphics: 7.5/10 - Decent for an anime game. Could be more detailed and looking less like it was made in the 2000's but it has its charm and fits fine.\nControls: 10/10 - Nothing out of place here, hardest control aspect may be trying to maximize mobs within an attack zone radius, especially for ranged weapons.\nGame Length: 7/10 - For a single play through with doing some collection, it will be about 20 hours. There are additional dungeons in NG+ though and the 2nd play through will most likely be where you go for the different endings which means at least 40 hours. A lack of dungeons compared to the first though is where the problem lies.","December 5, 2015","true","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat is fun, I like the game / industry humor but not so much the fan service. It's kinda like Disgaea but with a more ..'kawaii' wrapping and without the large panel based map battles.\n\nWhat I like:\nIt's more of the same but expanded, dungeons are larger to explore, there's more variety to character moves and more characters in general. The game keeps what was good but improves upon the first in terms of gameplay. The new characters reflect the companies they spoof well, Cave being a very amusing one who represents a company who makes bullet hell shooters...and her specials all reflect this. There's also a lot more characters and more focus on the non-CPU (transforming) characters.\n\nThe combat is fun, more so with a 4th character in battle allowing you to feel less cramped with battle options. Feels like you're more able to dishout damage while having 1 character handle support.\n\nWhat I don't like:\nThe game takes on a more darker tone from the get go, which loses a lot of impact when you find this is NOT the same universe at all. Shortly after the start a character recounts how she met Neptune and ...that's not how it happened. So this game has absolutely nothing to do with 1 story wise. Yes you still care for the characters but you have to wonder why they'd spin off in a series of games that already has (at the time of writing) 4 spin off titles on the Vita. There's more 'fanservice' which is less appealing because if you happen to look at the screens ...you'll notice there's 2 very young girls and they aren't shy with pushing some really dumb perversion with them.\n\nThey reuse a lot, I mean a bloody lot. Some music, characters & moves, the animated portraits, some maps are straight up lifted from the first game. There are new maps but you'll be starting a dungeon and hey, you were here in 1!\nI'm currently on chapter 3 and it's been very repititious, the same Underling character getting in the way and getting away. It feels like they dumped their efforts into the new characters vs adding interesting enemies. Maybe this changes later.\n3 chapters in and I really feel like I've done nothing because you just don't stop this 1 dumb character, or it's subordiantes. Near the end of it someone else FINALLY drops in.\n\nCurrently the game is bugged too, the world map music is unbearably loud and the rest of the music despite being jacked up well above the other sounds is too low. Which is a shame since the music is fun.\n\nI'm not saying this is a bad game, though I do seem to have more complaints than praise. I do like the first game better in ways...kinda like how Disgaea 1 had better story and characters and Disgaea 2 had superior gameplay, this is a lot like that. But if this game seems a bit wonky and you're interested in the new one coming out, Neptunia Victory...I wouldn't blame you for skipping this one since as I've stated it has nothing to do with the story of 1, maybe not Victory either.","July 10, 2015","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The rules and craft and boss fight is also still the same.\nWhat to be highlighted is there's a bug in the game that is sound and crash issue.\nI can only help on 1 part that is the crash issue during starting the game, that is by not skipping until you were directed to the main page (new game, continue, dlc, option n etc.). I didn't across any other crashes other than the opening part.\nAs for another one is, sound problem. Supposely, all the dialog and event conversation, there should be voiced by the character. But, sometime it didn't work out as if its mute. In awhile its is back to normal, then it happens again.\nThus, for those who are kinda down about it, I advice don't worry about it. Its kinda normal for japanese game being christianed, and these kind of problems occurs. Sooner or later, there's gonna be a patch for it and yes it is still new on Steam. So, you don't need to be regret once you bought it on SALE. Just get it while you can.","June 16, 2015","true","135.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a fan of fantasy games, and turn-based RPG combat in general, this pretty much ticks all the boxes for me. Gameindustri is under attack from an evil organization bent on destruction (aren't they always), and they've beaten the mightiest heroes -- the CPU's already. Cue the CPU candidates -- the younger siblings of the rulers of Gameindustri.\n\nWonderfully voiced characters take you on a more freeform journey across Gameindustri, with places to explore and items to be found. The crafting system let's you make everything from items to 'plans' which can add enemies to dungeons, change the items therein, or even unlock new dungeons.

Jump I have not found a use for yet aside from just wanting to make your character bounce in the air... or panty shots, if you're into that. Combat is fairly fluid and easy to learn, and you get new skills at a fairly regular pace. There are 3 different types of attacks, Rush, Power, and Break. Rush fills the EXE gauge, Power does more health damage, and Break does more guard damage. That along with 4 elemental properties, statuses, and being either physical or magic makes for a rather interesting mix for combat. You also have a reserve character slot for each character in your party, which you can swap out to if the party member is alive.\n\nGraphics are nice, not the best but definitely good for an anime style game. Some of the areas and characters look amazing, and some EXE attacks are just beautiful to watch. Music and sound effects are good, nothing you will remember, but fitting for the atmosphere of the areas or what you are doing. Voice acting is pretty decent, with most of the characters having well written, if sometimes cheesy as all hell, dialogue. There is also plenty of tongue in cheek humor and breaking of the 4th wall simply for the fun of it. Various enemies are reused over and over, with only palette swaps to really mark the difference in how they look, but that is standard for many RPGs.\n\nThere are a ton of playable characters. I have 13 right now and I am fairly certain there's at least another 7. Party size is 4 characters, with another 4 in reserve. Thankfully ALL characters that are alive get XP, regardless of if they're in the party or not.\n\nStella's Dungeon is a very nice little addition to this game, even if you do not control Stella directly it is entertaining to do. Equip her gear, send her on her way, and do whatever until she is beaten or comes back with loot.\n\nNow the bad...\n\nThis game is almost a direct clone of Re;Birth1, if you did not like 1, you are not going to like this. Combat, a list of characters, and various other things are all the same, and if you played the first one you are going to be going "haven't I done this before" every now and then.\n\nI mentioned the large amount of characters earlier, if you plan to keep them all up to date on gear you are going to be spending an obscene amount of currency. Another slight issue is with so many characters many will level up at the same time, and wanting to keep their combo abilities and finishers up to date can be annoying when 5+ characters all get new abilities after a single fight.\n\nIt is incredibly easy to overlevel your characters. And I mean insanely easy. I have not farmed for money or XP, just items now and then to finish off quests (quests give currency and items, not XP). I just got a new character and my characters are a good 12-15 levels above her. It should be noted you can use the plan system to weaken of strengthen the enemies.\n\nThat being said the story is different, there are new characters, new enemies, and I would buy it again.","June 11, 2015","true","35.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I want to believe, from what I remember, that I prefer the story from R1 over R2. That said, I don't mean that R2 is bad, it was fun and just as enjoyable as the first one.\n\nBoth games are pretty much the same deal with a different story and a few different elements. The main difference between R1 and R2 is that R2 has A LOT of endings and a mini game called Stella's Dungeon.\n\nFor whatever reason, Stella's Dungeon ended up being the thing I liked the most about R2.

The Stellas Dungeon mini game is... Kind of obnoxious, in that it utilizes the timer mechanic that is so popular in mobile F2P games.

However screw all that because it's got Nep-neps.\nBut now...\n\nYou can have 4 members in your party\nThere are a buttload of new endings which are mostly actually just extra scenes after the credits\nLily ranks and EXE Drives are introduced much earlier\nA lot more new potential waifu party members are available for a choosin'\nA little "mini-game" where you send someone off to a dungeon for a period of time where they barely bring anything useful to you.

That was really exciting for me, cause in Re;Birth1 I always wanted to have all 4 CPUs, as well as the candidates, in one battle but that was never possible. Now it was, and I thought that was a nice addition.\n+ I liked that the dungeons weren't all recycled versions of the dungeons we saw in the first game. Some look similar to those but most of them were new designs. Even the 4 cities were redesigned, and I think they look way cooler.\n+ Plenty of different endings and outcomes to add to the replayability value. One of the endings in particular, the Conquest Ending, was DARK AS HELL. I mean holy crap, I've seen bad endings in video games before but this one was like, really intense. Not even Nep's humor was able to soften it for me.\n+ Stella's Dungeon was a nice new feature as well. You're able to send Stella off to dungeons to find items while you continue on with the game.\n+ Just like in Re;Birth1 with the sisters, you can bring in the Oracles of each city into the game to join your party. I haven't done that but I'm working on it. The requirements are pretty high, but I'm determined. They have very cool designs.\n+ I guess I should put that there's a lot more boobage in the game. I mean it's not really my cuppa tea, but y'know. For all you pervs out there, I'm sure you'll be happy to know that the game wastes no time in shoving everything in your face, so to speak.\n\nCONS:\n- Besides the extra person in the party, there's really no new additions to the combat at all.\n- Less customizability was something I noticed. The outfit selection in particular was a lot more limited. In Re;Birth1, there were a ♥♥♥♥ ton of outfits in the shop. Now, though, they seem much fewer.\n- Not enough Nep-Nep! I don't know about you guys, but Nepgear was such an underwhelming heroine to me. She's just so... I don't know. I mean she's likeable and all, but she doesn't have as big of a presence as Neptune did. I was gleeful when Nep-Nep finally appeared and started talking, but it wasn't enough. :c I know Nepgear was supposed to be the star of this game but she didn't feel like one at all. I just kept waiting for Nep-Nep to appear. If you're a huge fan of Neptune herself, then I'm sorry to say she's not in this game much at all.\n- This is sorta tied with the not enough Nep-Nep thing. The game has much less funny moments or humor at all. Besides Neptune, Red is pretty much the only FUNNY character in my opinion. Besides that, the plot itself isn't all that engaging. Not that the first game's plot was amazing or anything, but y'know, at least it was fun to sit through due to the character interactions. In this one the characters are just meh, I think. Nepgear especially.\n\nOverall there are many things they could've done to make this much better than the first game, as a sequel should be, but I'm still pretty happy with it and having a blast playing it so far, so I definitely recommend it despite its flaws. Plus, I saw several trailers for Re;Birth3 and it seems like they're renewing a lot of the features with that game, so I'm pretty excited!","June 2, 2015","true","39.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played the very first game, as it came here to EU. It was not bad...but had great potential. The companies behind neptunia used it. Continued the series and improved it... They did remakes. I played original and remakes so far....in my 26 years gaming history...i have never seen such a good turn and i wish it will continue further. I played this game until i got nearly everything. I just love it...\n\n\nok here for the Positive points:\n\n+ great graphics\n+ great music\n+ many characters to play, with different strengths, character traits and lovely animation (about 20++ chars)\n+ funny references to movies, games, anime and other stuffs\n+ great and funny story\n+ nice quests and after-story content\n+ nice\n+ great feeling overall\n+ japanese voice acting is always superior...\n+ easy controls\n+ easy to understand\n+ gamicons (chibs) are cute (i even got 2-3 cups from neptunia with gamicons)\n+ many endings (played through 4-5 times already)\n+ played about 100 hours in total....

As a fan of fantasy games, and turn-based RPG combat in general, this pretty much ticks all the boxes for me. Gameindustri is under attack from an evil organization bent on destruction (aren't they always), and they've beaten the mightiest heroes -- the CPU's already. Cue the CPU candidates -- the younger siblings of the rulers of Gameindustri.\n\nWonderfully voiced characters take you on a more freeform journey across Gameindustri, with places to explore and items to be found. The crafting system let's you make everything from items to 'plans' which can add enemies to dungeons, change the items therein, or even unlock new dungeons. At it's heart is the combat, which is fun and, at times, quite funny. You haven't lived until you've beaten a monster half to death with a yoyo and some maracas!\n\nIf you like JRPG's, you'll absolutely love this one.

Whoever come up with those scripts, fire that guy. Super crappy translation. If you knew enough Nihonggo, you'll get by without reading the script but for the others who don't, it obscures the message as well as the personality of the character(s).\n\nStory-wise, completely unrelated to Rebirth1 as they say it happens in a different dimension (well that explains why it is called Hyperdimension per se). Though I kind of understand why they did it since it doesn't make sense to have powered-up imoutos when your onee-sans are strong enough to deal with issues (ala Rebirth1). They need to rewrite it so that the sisters would become the core in the game.\n\nGame play is the same as Rebirth1 with inclusion of another party member. Not sure why they added another slot since I didn't feel underpowered when there just 3 in a party in Rebirth1 but hey at least you could now roll-out with 4 CPUs at the same time. Word of advice, just put off the DLC weapons if you want a more genuine experience during battles in your first playthrough.\n\nEndings, with the emphasis on the 's'. We now have multiple endings depending on the conditions you've met while playing instead of just normal and true in Rebirth1. It requires share manipulation and lily rank levels which IMO is okay. Same goes with unlockable characters as well. Some people are usually put off with the 'amount' of work you need to accomplish this but IMO that is part of the game. You want something, you work for it. You want the game to hold your hand and be spoon-fed, look elsewhere. Anyway, once you get the gist of it, you'll start preparations to adjust the shares early in the game to get your desired outcome. Multiple playthroughs are encouraged but not required.\n\nIssues.. we'll I occasionally encounter crashes especially when entering dungeons before but I managed to deal with it by setting the compatibility to Windows XP.","July 4, 2015","true","136.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The main difference between R1 and R2 is that R2 has A LOT of endings and a mini game called Stella's Dungeon.\n\nFor whatever reason, Stella's Dungeon ended up being the thing I liked the most about R2.

I have 2 games out of my 600+ where I have completed 100% of steam achievements. One is this, the other is Agarest 2.\n\nOn to the review. I loved rebirth 1, and although I read some reviews saying this wasn;t as good, I;m glad I tried it. It;s every bit as good, and better in some key gameplay areas. The familiar format of epsidic story progression is there, and the end-game grind is there too. If you don't have that "gotta collect 'em all" mentality, this might not be for you. If you do however, there are a myriad of endings, plans to collect to your heart's content, and challenges to get you playing again.\n\nThere are some real improvements to the end-game grind as well. The colosseum isn't quite as challenging as Rebirth 1, there is an extra option on the dungeon plans, and  as usual, a lot of this can only be obtained in NG+.\n\nI took 6 playthroughs to get everything, it;s doable in 4, but I missed a couple of things. There's plenty to do, it's fun and actually despite first impressions there is a gem of an RPG here.

RESEARCH ACCORDINGLY BEFORE PURCHASING-\n\nThe sequel to Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;birth1, but this time with Nepgear, Sister and Sister candidate to Neptune, as the protagonist.  The mechanics are very similar to the original game, but are different enough to feel fresh. Many characters that were included in Re;birth1 are back, along with several new characters.\n\nPros\nLots of improvements over the original, and you can still have a personal army of waifus.\n\n\n-Loads of new characters, while still keeping (most) of the originals. (21+ characters if all are unlocked)\n\n-More (English) voice acting than the original\n\n-For most characters, voice acting quality is good (You will know the bad ones)\n\n-More endings than the original\n\n-Dungeon plans are simpler than the original (Original has giant webs of plans that make missing certain events easy.)\n\n-Combat is very similar to the original, but provides enough to feel fresh\n\n-Progression difficulty spikes are toned down a bit (In the original, you'd often have the grind heavily to fight the next boss, notably (Spoilers) Black Heart around chapter 2\n.\n-Story is trying to be a bit more serious, and even side characters are given a bit more lore\n\n-4 characters to a party opens up a lot more strategies\n\n-Dungeons feel larger, and the change dungeon plans give a lot more depth\n\n-You find interesting items more often (original often gave boring items from treasures)\n\n-Quest rewards are more interesting.\n\n-You can gain little extra rewards through the use of "Stella's Dungeon", an unlockable in-game feature.\n\n\nCons\nMostly minor, except for performance problems. I'm mostly listing little pet peeves.\n\n\n-PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS\n\n-Odd technical glitches (World Map volume is incredibly loud for example)\n\n-While most of the voice acting is good, bordering great, certain voice-acted characters are immersion breaking and downright cringy. (Dogoo and Killachines being the worst)\n\n-Early on, it is very easy to get locked into a single party composition and not use other characters.\n\n-Outfits for the sisters are fairly dull (So far, I can only get them from the shop, and they are just city-colored reskins of the default)\n\n-Bosses are heavily recycled ((spoiler) An early boss, Underling, is recycled a painful amount of times. If memory serves, I've fought her at least 8 times, with little variety)\n\n-Almost all the outfits obtainable require New Game+ items\n\n-Many random information events give very little knowledge to the player, and are practically carpet bombed on you after some major events and at the beginnings of new chapters (You may have to spend 5-10 minutes going through them all, some of which are major character events)\n\n\nNeutral\nThings I feel people could feel one way or the other about\n\n-Story is apparently an alternate-dimension side story...?\n\n-(SPOILERS) Ending requirements are difficult to prepare for without prior knowledge.\n\n--Conquest requires Nepgear to have a Lily Rank of 7 or less with all characters (Except Oracles?), and for all characters to be recruited before the last chapter (no prior warning).\n\n--Normal ending can even be difficult to get if you have the requirements for another ending, which may require a New Game+ to get. (Normal ending is anticlimactic as sin.)\n\n\n-Share management is a bit different from the original. Quests give more.\n\n-Colosseum battles are harder\n\n\nOverall a good game, but has a few frustrations, my biggest being the ending requirements (prior knowledge is required to avoid a forced New Game+).","August 22, 2015","true","53.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story was better, the characters were less insufferable, there was a little bit more balance.  That game flowled rather smoothly.  This game, however, has some rough edges, and some uncomfortable parts in it.\n\nBut it's still a fun game.  And some of the things they added are quite nice.  There's a new mini-game involved, in Stella's Dungeon, which mixes a game time I rather loathe ("Mysterious Dungeon" etc.), with the automation of "My Life as King".  YOU don't go through the rogue-like dungeon, you send someone else in to do it.  Though it's very random, and can be very frustrating at points.\n\nThere's more overall to do in this game.  But there's a lot of periods where it seems the devs didn't consider balance or chain or progression.  For example, you'll get a PLAN for a weapon at one point fairly early, but not the pieces until after you've already picked up something better.  Making the plan completely useless.  They also made some of the hidden dungeons very rare, and annoying to get until later on when you can detect hidden treasures.\n\nThey also introduced a rather game-breaking plan that lets you auto-win fights, with the rewards thereof, if you're powerful enough.  Which can help you power level, and thus STAY at that "powerful enough" stage from that point on, making the game play rather trivial overall.\n\nStill a good game, nowhere near as good as the first, but I've got lots more to do now that I've beaten it once.","September 14, 2015","true","80.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are more Chirper Events, more systematic built, more progressive than the first game, but in the end, both games have the same line of heroic quest, saving Gamindustri. (Btw, you get to have 4 people on the field at the same time. 4 People, how cool is that!?)\n\nHowever, contrasting its older sister, there is a bad ending, (although you will not encounter it simply) and we need to replay the game at least once (and work harder) to experience the full extent of the contents the game brings. Some research or experiments may be needed to fulfill this requirement, simply playing the game wasn't enough.\n\nThe only thing that doesn't fit in is that the Chirper Events occur doesn't match the hassle and busy mood the game proposed. Other than that, there are too many Chirper Events piling up on a certain point that we may get tired of reading it through. Blanc, Vert and Rom might enjoy this, but I'm pretty sure NepNep & Ram doesn't, since they prefer to smash and bust the concrete of those buildings with evil intentions.\n\nComparing to the first game, some of the map designs were unoriginal. But most of it feels like having its own backstory from its design, like epic, ya know. It's maps were more structured than the first game.\n\nMusic is a blast! (If you aren't comparing with the first game, mood is different, less action, more atmospheric) The music were refined as if it was designed for an older action gamer audience, its composed of more structured roots than its randomness.\n\nCharacters design and progression were original, pretty well set and preserved from the first game. Nothing much to say here other than the game adds more beloved characters to vanquish the monsters with!\n\nThis review may sound critical, but the game is awesome as much as the first game, like sisters, both have different sets of cognition, and I love both of them. (But NepNep is still the best.) If you enjoy the first series and gameplay style, you will truly enjoy the second.\n\n\nHowever, this game lives in a parallel universe from the first game. And comparing to the first series, this game has more fanservice. Good or bad, you decide.","September 15, 2015","true","32.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I went into this game knowing that the gameplay wasn't going to change much.  And I was right a few things were tweaked like the stats on humans which were garbage in Nep1.  But the one thing that really did me in was that the story was laking.\n\nThe story didn't feel as fun as it did in the first largly due to the fact that Neptune isn't a big part of it.  Instead of giving the other characters some spotlight they instead introduced a new character.  It was very obvious RED was only made to replace Neptune and recreate the chaos that was Neptune. There was also a lot of useless text.  More than the first. I found myself skipping story text because it was so repetitive and boring.\n\nThe gameplay is still fun. Again humans are actually pretty useful in this game they have a lot of aoe spells but with the draw back of not having HDD and gaining some temporary stats.  There are now 4 slots for your team which makes room for a lot more strategies but it seems like the enemies have gotten tougher too.  Big enemies take a lot more damage to kill. As for pretty much everything else its the same.\n\nThis game is fun but the story was just too bland and boring for me.\n\n**Not to mention the not-so-obvious requirements to even progress past the normal ending.  Rebirth1 never had that issue. If you got the normal ending in Reirth1 you just missed out on some different cutscenes and artwork.  In Rebirth2 you miss out on 2 full chapters including new dungeons, plans and story.  In retrospective that's like 20% of the game.","September 2, 2015","true","83.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The jokes and references are pretty bad (and it doesn't help that the translations saw fit to write in their own references in places where there were none to begin with) but the characters are entertaining and the jp voice cast is pretty stellar. Unfortunately, if you do know Japanese the game can be a bit jarring to read because of how much the english text differs from what is actually spoken. Kind of weird but the translation actually over sexualizes and cutifies almost every line. The spoken dialogue will say, really cute and the translation will become really cute and a tinsy bit sexy too! or I can't wait to see our video will become I can't wait to see our gyrating hips in glorious hd.. And then don't get me started on the cutsie language written into the dialogue.\n\nAnother problem I have with the game is that the whole anti-piracy premise is kind of condescending and a bit much. I get that it is meant to be a playful and quirky premise about the games industry as a whole but that kind of gets lost as the plot descend into good versus piracy, and most of it doesn’t even make sense. It's like every line about piracy in the game is written by some faceless corporate drone who sees each instance of piracy as a lost sale and uses it as a scapegoat for the companies own failings. When the game starts to feels like publisher propaganda it gets on my nerves a bit.\n\nThat aside though, it is a fun game, if a bit repetitive. There's actually more challenge to it than I was expecting and I’ve got no complaints about the games system, graphics, and characters.\n","October 15, 2015","true","56.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

HN Re;B2 is game play wise essentially the same as it's predecessor, mass grinding to level yourself against a challenging setting with turn based combat, very little is different from the previous game except it has more cut scenes, a few more movies, and DLC that dubs down the challenge. The story has some similarities to the previous, save the world from a fifth power that is trying to destroy everything, the main difference is that instead of playing with the 4 CPU's (the goddess' of the world) you play as there sisters, players from the previous game will see a lot of return characters, but the over all list isn't quite as big, other then that the game flows more or less the same with a major difference being the ability to have 4 characters in use for a battle. Other changes seem to be a dubbing down of some of the challenge, more plans and quest are far simpler, accessories can be found with ease, and dungeons tend to get revisited in the story, a major draw back to this game is the DLC, while the previous game gave you 2 extra characters that could use HDD it didn't kill the challenge, the DLC for this one however gives you an accessory that makes a character as buff as if they where an end game character as well as not 1 but 3 ultra powerful weapons for the main character which can easily kill almost all challenge even from the tough enemies, overall it was still fun but lacked as much challenge especially so thanks to the DLC, 6.5/10","June 4, 2015","true","40.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, occasional fanservice, yuri, ecchi and just general lewd jokes.\nLook, the game is great. I love it. I recommend anyone who enjoys RPG's and anime to buy it.\nIs the price fair? Probably not. It's a tad more expensive than I'd like it to be. It should be around 20€, maybe even as low as 15€. Why?\n\nAlright, time to point out the game's flaws. (Or rather, Re;Birth1's flaws, since, I didn't buy the game, so I can't review Re;Birth1 here on steam. But! I digress. Re;Birth2 doesn't seem too obviously different it's predecessor, so, I'll base this review on my experience with that game. If I notice that the sequel is any different once I progress further, than I shall come at a later time and edit this review.)\n\nHyperdimension Neptunia (Which I will now begin calling HDN, or, jokingly, HDTuna for shortnening reasons) is, like I said, great. But I, on many instances, felt bored when playing it. Bored, and annoyed. Why?\nFirst of all, the "Information" system. Y'know, the one where you have to go to the map and either select the message pop-up on the map or select a world and read through every single bit of "information" everyone has to offer. Seems simple, right?\nWRONG.\nThere are people that give you items to alter the way dungeons work (The so-called Plans, and the remake system). And, at the beginning, it's all fun and simple, the game is slow-paced, so, we're not encountering too many dungeons to which we could have those plans.\nThen you get to the late game. AKA, the "5 dungeons per story-related-action" area. And the "Here's 50 people offering NEW dungeons other than the story-related ones" area. Now, you get 2 plans for each dungeon. One for changing the items in it, the other for making enemies stronger. Let's multiply that 2 with the theoretical 15, assuming I progressed a bit in the story without pauses. Now let's sum the result of that, with the product of multiplying 50 with 2. So, (15*2)+(50*2)= 130.\n\nOne hundred and thirty.\nOne hundred and thirty people you have to talk to just to get that obnoxious "NEW!" message to stop appearing on every world.\nOne hundred and thirty LONGER-THAN-NEEDED chats with IRRELEVANT-TO-STORY characters.\n\nBut, that isn't even my biggest peeve with HDTuna. From my experience in the first game, enemies scale HORRIBLY. And I mean, HORRIBLY\nI died on the second dungeon, from a normal ghost enemy. And I had no idea that I would. After all, I was pretty much gliding through the enemies in the first dungeon.\nThen we have the "semi-bosses". The orange icons you encounter on pretty much every area in the late-game. These guys should be easier than the main bosses in that area, so, these guys are here basically just for me to grind, right? WRONG!\nI have had to re-do half an hour worth of gameplay due to making the mistake that semi-bosses would be easier than the boss itself. I had already defeated the boss in the area, and thought "Y'know what let's go ahead and defeat this dude. I'm sure after that boss, it won't be that hard."\nIt was.\nIt almost one-shot me after I did close to 0 damage to it due to it regenerating health every turn. And this is WITHOUT the "tough enemies" plan you can make after gathering certain items.\n\nSpeaking of making and gathering, the remake system in the game is kind of extremely annoying. The ammount of items and dungeons and plans you can make/get, make the list GIGANTIC, almost IMPOSSIBLE to even memorise, and some even ask you for items you couldn't get until much later in the game, when that ornament you wanted to make with said item is obsolete due to one you bought. It'd FEEL more worth it if the developers had let us known the actual stats and usages of the weapons/items/armour/et cetera. That way we'd know if the investment of time to grind for the items would be worth it. But instead we get what I can only describe as an unboxing simulator due to the nature of unknowing what we'll get.\n\nBut, I'm nitpicking.\nI really am.\nBecause, if you exclude the one or two times where the things I mentioned above actually HINDER you progress, the game really is fun to play.\nIt had me actually laugh to one or two jokes the writers slipped in, it has tasty references, and the characters are adorable and lovable.\nFor the price I paid for it (14€ + an extra 1 or 2 € for the helpful, but not needed AT ALL DLC), it's well worth your money. The trading cards alone made me my money back once I got foil cards on all the 4 drops (each card sold for 3€, holy guacamole). For the full price?... Maybe not so much. If you want to give it a shot, by all means.\n\nI give this game 4/5 tacos, with a side-dish of tortillas.","June 6, 2015","true","40.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat is fun, I like the game / industry humor but not so much the fan service. It's kinda like Disgaea but with a more ..'kawaii' wrapping and without the large panel based map battles.\n\nWhat I like:\nIt's more of the same but expanded, dungeons are larger to explore, there's more variety to character moves and more characters in general. The game keeps what was good but improves upon the first in terms of gameplay. The new characters reflect the companies they spoof well, Cave being a very amusing one who represents a company who makes bullet hell shooters...and her specials all reflect this. There's also a lot more characters and more focus on the non-CPU (transforming) characters.\n\nThe combat is fun, more so with a 4th character in battle allowing you to feel less cramped with battle options. Feels like you're more able to dishout damage while having 1 character handle support.\n\nWhat I don't like:\nThe game takes on a more darker tone from the get go, which loses a lot of impact when you find this is NOT the same universe at all. Shortly after the start a character recounts how she met Neptune and ...that's not how it happened. So this game has absolutely nothing to do with 1 story wise. Yes you still care for the characters but you have to wonder why they'd spin off in a series of games that already has (at the time of writing) 4 spin off titles on the Vita. There's more 'fanservice' which is less appealing because if you happen to look at the screens ...you'll notice there's 2 very young girls and they aren't shy with pushing some really dumb perversion with them.\n\nThey reuse a lot, I mean a bloody lot. Some music, characters & moves, the animated portraits, some maps are straight up lifted from the first game. There are new maps but you'll be starting a dungeon and hey, you were here in 1!\nI'm currently on chapter 3 and it's been very repititious, the same Underling character getting in the way and getting away. It feels like they dumped their efforts into the new characters vs adding interesting enemies. Maybe this changes later.\n3 chapters in and I really feel like I've done nothing because you just don't stop this 1 dumb character, or it's subordiantes. Near the end of it someone else FINALLY drops in.\n\nCurrently the game is bugged too, the world map music is unbearably loud and the rest of the music despite being jacked up well above the other sounds is too low. Which is a shame since the music is fun.\n\nI'm not saying this is a bad game, though I do seem to have more complaints than praise. I do like the first game better in ways...kinda like how Disgaea 1 had better story and characters and Disgaea 2 had superior gameplay, this is a lot like that. But if this game seems a bit wonky and you're interested in the new one coming out, Neptunia Victory...I wouldn't blame you for skipping this one since as I've stated it has nothing to do with the story of 1, maybe not Victory either.","July 10, 2015","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has its own pluses and minuses. Here's what I thought they were:\n\nPROS:\n+ 4 people in the party now! That was really exciting for me, cause in Re;Birth1 I always wanted to have all 4 CPUs, as well as the candidates, in one battle but that was never possible. Now it was, and I thought that was a nice addition.\n+ I liked that the dungeons weren't all recycled versions of the dungeons we saw in the first game. Some look similar to those but most of them were new designs. Even the 4 cities were redesigned, and I think they look way cooler.\n+ Plenty of different endings and outcomes to add to the replayability value. One of the endings in particular, the Conquest Ending, was DARK AS HELL. I mean holy crap, I've seen bad endings in video games before but this one was like, really intense. Not even Nep's humor was able to soften it for me.\n+ Stella's Dungeon was a nice new feature as well. You're able to send Stella off to dungeons to find items while you continue on with the game.\n+ Just like in Re;Birth1 with the sisters, you can bring in the Oracles of each city into the game to join your party. I haven't done that but I'm working on it. The requirements are pretty high, but I'm determined. They have very cool designs.\n+ I guess I should put that there's a lot more boobage in the game. I mean it's not really my cuppa tea, but y'know. For all you pervs out there, I'm sure you'll be happy to know that the game wastes no time in shoving everything in your face, so to speak.\n\nCONS:\n- Besides the extra person in the party, there's really no new additions to the combat at all.\n- Less customizability was something I noticed. The outfit selection in particular was a lot more limited. In Re;Birth1, there were a ♥♥♥♥ ton of outfits in the shop. Now, though, they seem much fewer.\n- Not enough Nep-Nep! I don't know about you guys, but Nepgear was such an underwhelming heroine to me. She's just so... I don't know. I mean she's likeable and all, but she doesn't have as big of a presence as Neptune did. I was gleeful when Nep-Nep finally appeared and started talking, but it wasn't enough. :c I know Nepgear was supposed to be the star of this game but she didn't feel like one at all. I just kept waiting for Nep-Nep to appear. If you're a huge fan of Neptune herself, then I'm sorry to say she's not in this game much at all.\n- This is sorta tied with the not enough Nep-Nep thing. The game has much less funny moments or humor at all. Besides Neptune, Red is pretty much the only FUNNY character in my opinion. Besides that, the plot itself isn't all that engaging. Not that the first game's plot was amazing or anything, but y'know, at least it was fun to sit through due to the character interactions. In this one the characters are just meh, I think. Nepgear especially.\n\nOverall there are many things they could've done to make this much better than the first game, as a sequel should be, but I'm still pretty happy with it and having a blast playing it so far, so I definitely recommend it despite its flaws. Plus, I saw several trailers for Re;Birth3 and it seems like they're renewing a lot of the features with that game, so I'm pretty excited!","June 2, 2015","true","39.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't like visual novels.\n\nThis is a visual novel JRPG... thing. I love it. Why? The characters are relatable because you have to live through their struggles with them as your proxy. But why is the gameplay tolerable?\n\nWell...\n\nThere's a sword in the DLC that totally destroys the progression curve in the game, and its ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic. No, seriously. I'm not kidding. I'm a gamer of two realms, one of action and one of story. I like multiplayer competitive games such as World of tanks, and story-driven games like Bioshock and System Shock 2. Grinding for hours and hours on end isn't something I have time for.\n\nVery minor spoilers ahead, stuff you'll see in the first five minutes:\n\nThat DLC sword cut the entirety of the game's grindtastic feel out, made me feel like a baddass and I roleplayed (ACTUALLY ROLEPLAYED) as NepGear, the protagonist, being actually powerful enough to take on the big bad from the get-go, but she didn't have the confidence.\n\nThis actually plugs up a few plot holes, such as why NepGear was the only one to go with the other main CPU goddesses to fight the big bad in the first place. The very first cutscene in the game shows the main CPU characters being stomped into the dirt when you (probably) spent the entirety of the last game, which took me 50~ ish hours to complete. Most of that was boring slog grinding.\n\nOne has to assume that battle-hardened warriors wouldn't take a squishy newbie into such a critical battle, so therefore she must have been talented enough to risk taking her to the big bad fight. No, you can't say that it was for a numbers advantage, because they didn't take the other CPU canidates.\n\nIts also worth noting that litteral goddesses should be able to outright crush low-level monsters and people with minimal effort, delegating other characters to support roles.\n\nThis is the first time I've ever seen DLC improve a game in such a profound manner.\n\n10/10, would pay2win again.","November 2, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I do have three complaints when comparing this game to the first one:\n\n1. ) It is a little buggier, but there is a workaround (Go to the Steam library, right click the game, go to properties, then local files, then view local files. Right click the .exe and set it to work in XP mode. I don't know why this works, but it does.)\n\n2.) The fanservice seems more gratuitous this time around and it could have been toned down. If I wanted giggly Anime boobs, there are better sources to get them. Strangely, one of the main bad guys is a super perverted monster. That's sending mixed signals.\n\n3.) Final complaint, there's way too many info boxes that just waste time. You can't ignore them, because some give you plans, or items, or even MBs to complete plans, but way too many of them are completely skippable.","November 13, 2015","true","69.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here is what I thought was good and bad about the game:\n\nPros:\n-Funny and serious at times.\n-Story is mainly focused on the CPU candidates, however the CPUs are present and obtainable in the game.\n-Kawaii CPU candidates with their own unique personalities.\n-60 FPS!(Most of the time)\n-Lots of endings for you to choose.\n-You don't have to grind as much as in the first game.\n-Aquired new waifus.\n-A little easier to get all the achievements.\n-Bosses are fairly easy and only a few are rigged to make you lose.\n\n\nCons:\n-Issues, performance and occassionally crashing(most of the issues are addressed in the Steam Guides and a quick Google search should fix your problems.)\n-Developers don't seem to care about this particular game anymore to fix the issues.\n-Not that much accessories(atleast the ones I wanted) for the CPU candidates.\n\nNeutral:\n-Dungeons look very similar to the ones found in R;B 1(with the exception of a few)\n-Soundtrack was okay, but nothing really stood out.\n-Grinding(which should be expected in these types of games)\n-Felt less polished than R;B 1.\n\nFinal Analysis:\nIf you are a fan of the other games or just want to play a awesome JRPG(and aquire a waifu), I would recommend Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;birth 2 and the other games to you.\n\nP.S: Uni is best waifu. 9.5/10","May 7","true","44.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played the first game and absolutely adored it. The second game took the characters and used the plot to sharpen as well as depen them. This game was a lot more serious than the first, which was sort of depressing if you're like me. Nonetheless, it has its goofy moments.\n\nThe game is great, just like the first game. It uses all the same little bits and bobs like the Plan system, the Nep-Pedia, the Lilly Rank system and the Coloseum. The game has a good plot, but these little pieces are what really make this gem sparkle. It really shows the time and effort the developers put into the franchise.\n\nAlmost all of the characters you meet in the game were met in the first game, so you don't need to keep meeting new ones all the time. The characters in this title are deepened, and the change is even more hard hitting because of the more serious storyline. Their abilities in battle are also more or less the same, with a few tweaks to spice things up. This title also uses the EXE Drive Gauge, so prepare to unleash some awesome boss nukes!\n\n","April 24","true","24.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
