It's beyond Portal.\n\nIt takes Portal's approach to first person environmental puzzle solving and, standing on its shoulders, reaches higher, offering you much more sophisticated puzzles of various kinds that sometimes have several layers and sometimes even inter-operate. The reality you are operating in is filled with messages and secrets, not unlike the world of Animus from Assassin's Creed, telling you a story and fuelling your brain. And just like in AC, you get some secondary things to do when you get tired of the "main" puzzles.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic. Landscapes are gorgeous. Controls are perfect. Music is superb. Voice acting is impeccable. Length is ideal. Puzzles are mind-bending. Progression is non-linear. This game might be officially "indie", but its quality is triple A. Or quad A. To call it non-trivial is like to say that a rocket is non-slow. And what's most valuable, is that you don't feel that profits were the top priority for the makers. The game was.\n\nThe things I love about it the most:\n• Assisted jumping. Just brilliant. If only Quantum Conundrum had it.\n• No fake puzzles based on arcade elements.\n• Weather effects.\n• I can get as close as I can to a wall and still see no blurred textures.\n• Wherever I go, I never get stuck in terrain.\n• Skippable intro movie and sensible menus.\n• Runs on my Macbook Pro.\n• Has a free demo.\n• It's so clever, it feels alive.\n\nThe things I dislike:\n• Loud "Death" sequence can give one a pretty good scare when comes unexpected.\n• It ends.\n\nIf you like puzzles - buy it. If you like first person games - buy it. If you like philosophy - buy it. If you like lasers - buy it. If you like finding secrets - buy it. If you like clever writing - buy it. If you like computer games - buy it! And if you don't like computer games...

I liken it to Dear Esther, but twenty times longer and filled with actual gameplay, while keeping the beauty of the world and the philosophical overtones intact.\n\nThe game consists of walking through majestic-looking outdoor areas to find closed-off puzzle areas, then solving puzzles using only a small handful of simple and easy-to-understand machines. The puzzles themselves are eloquent and very well-tested. There are over a hundred of them in all, but each puzzle introduces a new idea or uses old ideas in new ways, so they never feel repetitive or stale. The game’s environments are simply breathtaking with their huge draw distances and ridiculous detail, while the puzzle areas feel aptly like claustrophobic rat mazes while never losing the area’s sense of atmosphere. The puzzles get very challenging near the end, but expert level design makes them all very rewarding to solve. And if you’re particularly clever, the game’s third ending requires you to figure out how to break the level design and take items out of their designated areas to find secrets hidden in closed-away or out-of-bounds places. It’s rather mind-blowing and something that I’ve never seen incorporated into a game intentionally before.\n\nThe icing on the cake is the storytelling. The story is that you’re a robot who wakes up in a garden and follows the commands of a god-like figure constantly talking in your head. It quickly becomes apparent that the whole world may or may not be a virtual reality simulation, which may or may not have been programmed by humans for a specific yet unknown purpose, and you are given the choice of blindly following the god’s orders or trying to unravel the mystery of who exactly you are and what lies outside of the simulation. The game has three different endings, and you will find whatever answer you seek if you search hard enough.\n\nThe game poses a few difficult philosophical questions and studies them from countless different angles. I know that some people will find the philosophy pretentious and trite, and I know it’s completely up to personal preference, but for me it really, really worked. I was hooked on the story the whole way. I think that even if some of the game’s lines fail to impress you, there’s enough material here that you’ll find at least something that will strike a chord and challenge the way you think. Besides, if you don’t like the story, it’s easy enough to skip everything by ignoring the computers, but you might miss out on the brilliance of some of the game’s endings.\n\nI give The Talos Principle a perfect score. It’s got sublime puzzle design, mind-blowing secret collectables, gorgeous environments that put Dear Esther to shame, above-average voice acting, a professionally-written and well-presented story, nearly zero glitches, and depths and depths of content. It’s truly one of the best games I’ve ever played. Go play it if you haven't already; you might come out feeling like a different person.","August 8, 2015","true","55.8"," 609 of 627 people (97%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","97","609","627","30","6"

There is a reason why "The Talos Principle" is a hit among critics and the player reviews are "Overwhelmingly Positve." For me this is a new classic. A game that catches lightning in a bottle.  One of those games that scratches an itch I didn't even know I had.\n\nNOTE: If you think you might get this game, I'd recommend against watching video and looking at player  screenshots. They are both highly likely to contain spoilers and inadvertent puzzle hints, both minor and major.  I only played the demo going into the full game and I feel the experience was better for it.\n\nThis is a first person, sci-fi themed puzzler in which the player, an artificial intelligence, is left to complete puzzles by using a series of tools that are introduced throughout the game. The first tool is the Jammer, a tool that jams electronic devices and force fields. Another tool connects to and aims laser beams.  You'll also learn that tools can be used in combination, keeping the progression interesting. Solving a puzzle rewards the player with a sigil (tetromino) which are then used as puzzle pieces to unlock new areas when arranged correctly in puzzle mini-games.\n\nThe only conversational contact the player has is with another AI program that often presents itself at computer terminals as the game progresses. The player is also, through communicating at the terminals and reading information displayed on them, left to ponder the role of the disembodied voice known as "Elohim", as well as the meaning of life, consciousness, being human, being alive, free will, and the afterlife.\n\nThe game itself is solid. Easy and tight controls. Very nice music, sound effects, and voicework. Clean, often beautiful graphics. Intelligent writing. No profanity or violence. Menus with many options like FOV, character speeds, FPS display, time display (something I never used as I chose to take my time), etc. This is a quality "product" every way I see it and a fantastic game from a company that respects it's PC customers.\n\nMany have compared this to the Portal games, which is high praise. While both offer clever puzzles and a high quality experience, "The Talos Principle" only rarely depends on any sort of physical dexterity or reflexes.  With those few puzzles that do require quickly timed movement, even the most casual of players shouldn't have any issues whatsoever.\n\nWhile the presentation and story are high quality, it's really about the puzzles. What makes them so satisfying?  First, puzzles do not need to be finished in an exact order. Leave one alone for a while that you are having trouble with and try again later.  I found it interesting how I'd find myself struggling with a puzzle but after a day or two, the solution would become clear. It was almost "scary" when realizing how hard at work my subconscious was. I would also think about certain puzzles when not playing and come up with new things to try out.  I  found myself overthinking many times when the solution was much simpler. Also, just when I thought I had a handle on a "recipe" that certain types of puzzles used, the game would throw me a curveball, forcing me to deviate from previous "patterns".\n\nSome puzzles, even of the harder variety, can be figured out quickly depending on the player's frame of mind, while "easier" puzzles (those without numerous elements) can be trickier. You know the puzzles are good when you find yourself wanting to do "just one more" before ending a session.  And puzzles can often be completed in more than one way. I found out later that some solutions I used were much much more complicated than they needed to be. This dynamic of overthinking vs. underthinking is what helped make my time with "The Talos Principle" so interesting, as well as thinking out a solution before acting vs. using a lot of trial and error at other times.\n\nThis game also encourages and rewards exploration. There are stars to collect, which unlock additional content in the form of more puzzles and ultimately an additional ending choice (there's a main ending and two possible side endings). These stars are often "puzzles within puzzles" and gathering them is rewarding and can be quite challenging. It's not just a matter of "hide and seek". For example, a star may be within a puzzle and behind a door (force field). It is up to the player to figure out how to reconfigure his/her solution so that an additional door can be opened. There is also an ample amount of "Easter eggs" to find, many of which are interactive and well worth seeking out. Many are references to other games, like Portal 2 or Papers Please. Pink Floyd is honored with one as well.\n\nKeep your eyes wide as you traverse the puzzles and worlds. Even just finding ways to exploit the simulation is fun, for example, finding a way to climb over the outer walls of a puzzle and into "out of bounds" areas (where there are some Easter eggs to find). Or  "breaking" a puzzle by finding an "unintended route" to the finish by climbing over a wall, or walking above one. (This accounts for a lot of my game time).\n\n"The Talos Principle" should appeal to a wide variety of players. I spent about 80 hours on my first playthrough and a less thorough playthrough will of course take less time. I then replaid  for 100% achievements (which I usually don't do). I suspect that many of the people finishing Talos in "20 hours" are not doing everything (reading files, getting all stars/doing the puzzles they unlock, looking for easter eggs) and likely to be using a walkthrough here and there. You can play this game as you want. Complete the puzzles in order or don't. Do them fast or slow. Solve star puzzles or don't. Don't read every piece of information at the terminals if the story side of the game doesn't interest you. Look closely for Easter eggs or don't worry about them at all. Try out the side endings or don't.\n\nThe support is very good with developers active on the Steam forums should anyone have issues and updates have been released to fix and add things (like an added special settings menu for "motion sickness", a speed time function, additional language support, etc.). This company, Croteam, does it right. You should give them your money just "based on principle."\n\nNOTE: The demo is also good, yet only a taste of the full game. It ofters a solid introduction to gameplay and some clever puzzles. There is even another free game called the "Sigils of Elohim" that is made of tetromino puzzles. Solving them will reward you with codes that are then entered into the menu of "The Talos Principle" for bonuses. These do not change the core game at all but, for instance, you can get stars with these codes.\n\nAll the regular stars will still be in the game to find. If you get the codes for bonus stars (three in total), you will start with three stars in the full game. So, you'll be free to leave three stars unfound if you wish and still receive the bonus content for finding all of them. In other words, if you start with the bonus stars and then go on to find every star in the game, you will finish with an extra three stars.\n\nPS: If you get and finish the game, check out my screenshots if you want (NOT before you play). Some hint at additional "challenges". Like getting a picture of the blue man visiting the greedy man and living to tell about it.","February 16, 2015","true","103.4"," 439 of 459 people (96%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","96","439","459","10","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterevilace/recommended/257510/","masterevilace","A Fancy Fridge Magnet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterevilace/","707 products in account","A first/third-person puzzle game with beautifully themed environments and captivating original soundtrack.\n\nYou solve world puzzles to collect Sigils (Tetris pieces, essentially), and you use those collected Sigils in Sigil puzzle locks (which unlock doors or new puzzle mechanics.) To solve a lock you must arrange the Sigils in a preset rectangular pattern. Along with Sigils there are collectable stars which are used to unlock more difficult content. The stars themselves are often fairly difficult to collect, but are very satisfying.\n\nThe game plays at your own pace, as puzzles are solved with theory and execution as opposed to timing and platforming. Due to the design of puzzles being self-contained experiences, you can play casually, only completing a few puzzles during a session without worrying about losing progress and having to redo a bunch of them. You can't manually save in the middle of a puzzle, but progress is saved as events get triggered, and your last puzzle/world location is kept track of, so it's easy to continue where you left off.\n\nThe game does not hold your hand as you play... you aren't told how to use puzzle mechanics, but rather you learn how to use them through natural play and experimentation. The learning curve is very gradual but you will find yourself dealing with fairly complex puzzles later on in the game as you become accustomed to the mechanics. The game isn't a linear progression of puzzles so if you get stuck on a puzzle you can skip it and come back to it later (and often solving it after having an epiphany.) The only barriers are Sigil Locks, which do require you to collect at least certain  "easy" Sigils before advancing too far.\n\nThe story of the game is conveyed through various means... through ELOHIM (the voice in the sky), audiologs (from a female scientist), journal entries (archived data in computer terminals), and messages written on the walls (by various characters.) A big, unique part of the story is done through interactive events in the terminals, where you will interact with an AI character through dialogue trees. The AI will make you think, articulate your thoughts, and ultimately question yourself. If you wish to partake in the story and get the most of it, you'll find yourself having a lot to read, but it's all completely optional and can be skipped if you really just want to solve puzzles. The writing and voice acting are all super high-quality with perfect execution.\n\nThe level design is based on real-life environments and themes primarily from Roman, Egyptian, and Medieval architectures, with a few "fantasy" environments thrown in. Weather and time of day add a lot of variety to the worlds and keep them fresh and feeling unique from one another. Environmental textures and models are very detailed and are made from real life photographs and 3D scans, as I understand it. Puzzle mechanics clearly stand out from the detailed environments by being pristine and more technologically advanced in nature, as to not get in the way of solving the actual puzzles. Puzzle areas are designed to feel open and allow you to see to other areas so you get a good sense of what all you have to work with and the area you have to utilize. Areas such as walls, fences and stairs feel natural while still retaining very distinct purposes, often aiding you in coming up with the solution without you necessarily realizing it.\n\nThere's a ton more I could say about this game, but all in all you're looking at around 20 hours or more of content spanning around 120 puzzles (not including Sigil lock puzzles or additional secrets.) A second play-through is likely if you're wanting to explore alternative dialogue trees, get all the achievements, find all the secrets/messages, or attempt speed-running. There is also a level editor included as well as Steam Workshop support for user-generated content. The PC version of this game has more settings than you have ever seen before, so it can run smoothly on rather low-end hardware, and you can adjust to your liking.\n\nFull disclosure: I was a volunteer beta-tester for this game for ~3 months prior to release, and I have ~180 hours of play in ~4 playthroughs. I highly recommend this game and supporting the developer, Croteam!","December 11, 2014","true","255.2"," 448 of 472 people (95%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","95","448","472","10","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EnigmaticInterChange/recommended/257510/","EnigmaticInterChange","The Cockroach King","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EnigmaticInterChange/","333 products in account","Comparing The Talos Principle to a game like Portal is unfair, but immediate. The first time I manipulated a gadget to set off a part of a puzzle, I muttered how much it reminded me of the amazing and witty Portal 1 and 2, and that trying to replicate it was unwise. However, I removed my premature opinions and discovered a whole new world of puzzle and story, placed perfectly in what is called The Talos Principle.\n\nThe game starts out in ruins, immediately piquing interest and curiosity. This first person interaction makes it impossible to know who you are, or what you are doing in the deserted grounds of what seems like Rome. The land is littered with broken pillars and faulty statues, most of which are missing their heads.\n\nVery shortly after running around, an all powerful voice beams from the skies, introducing himself and welcoming you to his garden. The puzzles ahead are a test to see if you are worthy (of what is unclear) and to strengthen your faith in him, "ELOHIM."\n\nWithout going into spoilers, I must say that the story is my favorite part of this game. Despite everything right about The Talos Principle, I’m a sucker for a great story, and very few games have the tone that this one carries beautifully and makes one question the nature of humanity. Almost every word spoken or typed holds a deeper meaning. Nothing is there without reason, and everything is set up in such a way that I didn’t feel left out of anything. There will be no regrets to finishing this game and seeing everything tie together.\n\nGameplay is very simple, which is nice, because the puzzles are not. Having the option, I opted for controller, assuming I could sit back, relax, and enjoy a nice, scenic mind game. I was wrong. Despite the scenery being beautiful and the music peaceful, my anxiety levels were high, attempting to freeze the laser gun that will shoot you down and sneak past the bots that will blow you up. And that’s within the first puzzles. You can’t do much on your own, only using what is provided to pass each task. It makes learning controls easy, which is nice when you have to take most of your focus into the puzzle.\n\nThere are only a handful of gadgets as well, each with a specific task that they do. Don’t be fooled though, because sometimes they are good for more than what they are intended. The puzzles themselves are short, only getting a little longer with time. Difficulty levels vary, but progress nicely with you, rather than slamming you with something impossible. There are also several puzzles per section, which gives you some options in case you get stuck. This attribute is great as the story is a heavy part that everyone should be able to complete.\n\nWhat the game lacks in wit and comic relief, it replaces with promise and charm as that nagging curiosity presses you forward. There is a lot of content, which can be overwhelming if you want to follow the story, but luckily the audio tracks and journal entries are logged and easy to access at any time.\n\nAnother nice feature is the hunt for stars, which can be within the puzzle or just randomly hidden on the selected map. It had a lingering feel of Mario 64 about it. It also gives you a break from some frustrating enigmas and allows you to enjoy the landscapes. The signs are helpful to look at as well, so use them. They even mark off what you have completed, though who does it for you is unknown. Kind of spooky, right?\n\nThe Talos Principle doesn’t let down on graphics, either. Each stage and each little world is beautifully done, with sounds and music to match. Voice acting was very well done, allowing you to stay immersed in the game. The settings are almost too good to be real, which makes the game ever more creepy. Keep a look out when just walking around. There are some questionable sights on the rocks, in the water. You are clearly the only one around which raises the question, “where is everyone else?” Though questions like this will be answered, the theories I came up with thanks to the surrounding areas wwere a little unsettling.\n\nWith all of the story, the background, creepy settings, and subtle hints, I’d say this game is very replayable, especially if you are like me and forget how to do the puzzles. I know I’m one to miss things the first time around, so going back is always good.\n\nDespite the eerie feeling I got every time I turned the game on, I was so compelled to read the QR codes on the walls, left by others before me. I wanted to understand the notes in the computer library and I wanted to know who ELOHIM really was, and what he wanted with me.

Though it is, at it's core, a puzzler. The puzzles are often complex, a few head-scratchers, but sometimes require a more reductionist approach. What may seem complex at first may turn out to be very straightforward. At times it requires you to question the assumptions it has itself given you. Good exercise for the whole brain, as it doesn't train through repetition but demands both creativity and reason, both abstract thought and technical logic. Along with the puzzles a story gradually unfolds. Concepts of self, place and time begin to dawn while another mystery deepens. I like that the story is only hinted at and alluded to, so that you formulate the idea on your own. It makes it that much more meaningful and powerful. It is likely the most existential and eternally relevant topic one could imagine, and the story itself would make a fascinating novel or film. My only complaint is personal, that the game seems to make assumptions concerning beliefs, more specifically, that having them is a universal quality of humans. But this is not at all the case. At times it seemed as though the authors had an agenda to express their own beliefs, but perhaps this was just my suspicion of beliefs in general. The dialogue trees where multiple choice and never once did I actually agree with any of the choices. So it felt like being pigeon-holed and I ended up arguing for a point I didn't actually think was correct. Other than that minor brow-furrowing frustration, I really enjoyed spending time in the beautifully rendered game world. The music was lovely and atmospheric. Extremely smooth play with a good variety of menu options. It's rare that a puzzle game addresses both hemispheres of the brain as well as the subconscious mind. I strongly consider it a work of genius. Oh, and if you decide to play it, I left some messages for you. ;)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=575360255\nEdit for dlc: While a bit on the pricey side for a dlc, it is well worth it. For those seeking greater challenge, many of the puzzles in RtG are considerably more difficult than in the base game. With greater challenge comes greater satisfaction at solving them. Themes from the base game are carried over, and somewhat expanded upon, in a way that I found both humorous and enlightening. It seems to me nothing short of a mirror held up to human nature itself. My earlier point about feeling pigeon-holed in the interactions is rendered moot by new understandings and realizations. So it goes with real learning, when something this worthwhile makes it's dawn across the mind, all one can do is smile. :)","March 29, 2015","true","55.3"," 263 of 278 people (95%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","95","263","278","10","24"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/257510/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","OverviewThe Talos Principle is a puzzle indie game developed by Croteam and is in my opinion one of the best puzzle games out there and although not comparable to games such as Portal, it's certainly not too far off. The game is well-polished, with a great storyline that will test your brains even when not completing puzzles.\n\nThe Pros: Many Puzzles - Probably the most important aspect of puzzle games, and where, unfortunately, many disappoint, is the length. Not here. This game rocks a whopping 129 puzzle levels, enough to keep you busy for several hours! The trickiest part is the bonus "Star Sigils" that are hidden or hard to reach, and in order to do that you have to think outside the box and interact with items from different puzzles at once to obtain them.\n\nInteresting Lore - I won't spoil the story much, but around levels you will find terminals which give you access to a library containing many readable text files so you can learn about your purpose and the backstory to the game. These are optional, but offer a good read, and often times include easter eggs and gags.\n\nBreathtaking Characters - The peculiar thing about this game is that it made me feel like it had characters within it, even though you never actually see them. There is Elohim, a god-like voice in the Sky, Milton, a PC program and Alexandra, a mysterious woman who left recordings for you to find. Even though the former two are not real, but artificial intelligence, the way you interact with them and the dialogues you can have with Milton really make you feel like there is someone you are interacting with. Croteam managed, using only text messages and voice recordings to give you a sense of wonder. Around the world you can also find QR codes (which I've tested, they are actually real) that are the thoughts of other "players" from the past. Some of them appear often and you can even distinguish their personalities. Wonderfully done.\n\nMultiple Endings - A thing I find very important in games is choice. Here, you have an open world, and can complete any puzzle you want, at any time, granted you have enough sigils to unlock the area. After you have enough, you have four possible endings to discover. A nice touch.\n\nThe Story - I promise, no spoilers. This should probably be the first on the list, but without managing to say much about the story so you can enjoy it, I will just say this: It is amazing. You just wake up, not knowing what or where you are and from that point on you just discover - pay attention to your surrounding, read the library entries, collect the sound files, read the QR codes left by those before you and get to a conclusion yourself. The story is also a reinterpretation of the Bible's Genesis chapter, and after you play the game, you will know why.\nThe Cons: No Custom Levels - The game features Steam Workshop, but it only has a few mods and not really any levels, nor does the game come with a level editor. This could have really extended the lifespan of the game, and I hope it will be implemented in later versions, or at least a free DLC. This does not take away from the gameplay experience and should not stop you from buying it.\n\nLevel Diversity - Don't get me wrong, the levels are all unique in their own way and each serve a challenge, but the game items are only so many. You have the following logic items: Gates, Turrets, Guards, Lasers, Jammers, Fans, Buttons and Cubes... that's about it. While they are combined in wonderful, different ways, some tricks that are learned through earlier levels almost always give a very big hint on how to solve the difficult puzzles in later gameplay. I would have hoped it is not the same.\nConclusion:The Talos Principle is one of the best puzzle games I've encountered so far and definitely worth a purchase if you like a good mind game with suitable backstory and lore. Purchase with confidence, this indie game has better quality than some AAA games.\n\nAlso check out my review of The Talos Principle: Road to Gehenna\nIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

(or read below if you're in doubt, ofc)\n\nI don't use the word lightly, but The Talos Principle is TRULY a masterpiece!\n\nThis game is definitely among the top 3 I've played in my life. Actually I can't remember any better game from the top of my head right now, so, yeah, that's a lot.\n\n+ This game is DEEP, mainly in a philosophical way, and that's where this game really shines (don't get me wrong, the puzzles are awesome). Really, not the usual superficial philosophy you usually get on videogames--real philosophy! You'll spend quite some time reading files and listening to records, discussing theories with a computer terminal, proving your point, being contested etc.\n+ The story is very rich, and obscure, and starts making sense little by little, not having to resort to plot twists, which tend to be a little too cliché.\n+ At least 3 endings that I can think of.\n+ Will keep you entertained for many,many hours (my first playthrough was like 30h, the second was about 5h).\n+ Very nice puzzles (and a lot of them, over 120), and they usually escalate in difficulty very smoothly. But they're all solvable with enough effort. Also, they're probably where you'll spend most of your playtime if you're not checking guides.\n+ Tons of side-quests -- easter eggs, secret stars, hidden levels, which will also keep you busy for a long time.\n+ Music and graphics are pretty impressive, too.\n+ Easily customizable settings and controls for the perfect experience.\n\nWARNING: To fully enjoy the game, you'll have to read a lot. Of course, if you just want to go through the puzzles, you can do that, and ignore all the text files and recordings.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/akatarzynak/recommended/257510/","akatarzynak","AKatarzynaK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/akatarzynak/","388 products in account","Due to the fact that The Talos Principle is a science fiction based first person puzzler, it’s hard not to make comparisons to Portal. However, while Portal is a more lighthearted game, the Talos Principle is more somber and thought-provoking. Drawing inspiration from writers like Isaac Asimov, Philip K. D*i*c*k (Apparently Steam doesn't like his last name), and John Milton, as well as a number of philosophers, it takes a much different approach to the puzzle genre.\n\nWith heavy philosophical undertones, you will find yourself thinking beyond the puzzles as the very world around you is questioned. This, in combination with a visually stunning environment, creates one of the most wonderful and unique experiences that I've had in a game.\n\nPlaying as an android, you must solve puzzles while at the same time being posed a series of increasingly introspective questions about your existence. I am going to refrain from saying anything more about the story so as not to spoil anything. This is a highlight of this game and is best experienced by going in to it knowing as little as you possibly can.\n\nThe puzzles are very unique, with various elements being added throughout to provide for an experience that never once felt repetitive to me. In these puzzles you will collect sigils using boxes, jammers, crystal prisms to connect lights, avoid mines, and float high up in to the air with fans. The most notable tool at your disposal is undoubtedly the ability to record yourself, allowing you to create what is basically a clone of yourself, which will act out your previous actions while you work with it in real time to solve the puzzle at hand.\n\nThe puzzles are very scattered in difficulty. Most were able to be solved in very little time, with a select few that I found myself having to really think about. If you want some more difficult puzzles, or you’re like me and want to squeeze every second out of this game that you possibly can, then I highly recommend doing the extra puzzles which are marked by the stars. These are not required to finish the game, but I found them to be some of the most enjoyable ones to complete as they can be more challenging and mind-bending, forcing you to really think outside of the box (or designated puzzle areas).\n\nThe world is huge, often times even a bit overwhelming. There are quite a few secrets hidden around, so you will be rewarded for exploring. There are also messages and words scattered throughout which provide backstory as well as give you insight to other characters. These can be found on computer terminals, audio logs, and QR code graffiti, and really do add something special to the story. I really enjoyed finding these, and felt that it added a nice touch.\n\nNot only are the graphics superb but the music is lovely and perfectly suited for the various environments as well as puzzle solving.\n\nThere is also a huge amount of customization available in the options menu, which is always to be appreciated. This allows you to change the size of the game hub (or remove it entirely), remove cross-hairs, change from first-person view to third-person, etc.\n\nThis is a lengthy game, and at my time of completion of the storyline I have clocked about 37 hours of playtime. For this length and the high quality of this game, I feel that the current asking price is more than fair.\n\n10/10 would erase from my memory and play again.","December 21, 2014","true","37.7"," 219 of 235 people (93%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","93","219","235","18","9"

So, if you're worried about your computer not being able to run the game, then fear not. I have a crappy integrated graphics card, and I can still run this game and its silky smooth.\n\nNow, lets get to the gameplay.\n\nAs others have said, you are just dropped into the world, and expected to figure things out for your self. There is no 'tutorial' on what objects do what or how you are supposed to solve a puzzle. You just figure it out.\n\nOne of my other favorite things about the game is the little QR codes that are strewn about the levels/world. Past 'test subjects' would leave notes for future 'test subjects'. Now, you can point your cursor at the QR code in game and it will display it, but I decided to download a QR code reader on my smart phone and scanned it with my camera and it reads it. Which I find is a really nice touch.\n\nAll in all, this is a fantastic and beautiful puzzle game. If you are a portal fan, then you'll deffinitely want to get this game. And remember, it will run smoothly on the crappiest of rigs.\n\n*Addition*\n\n-Since this review is gaining more attention, I decided to add a little more to my origional review of The Talos Principle.\n\nOne of the things I failed to mention the first time, is how the game is sort of non-linear.\nThere are 3 'for the sake of this review, lets call them sections' sections. A, B, and C. in each section, there are multiple worlds. In each world, there are multiple puzzles. If you're stuck on a puzzle, and can't figure it out, then you can just walk away and go to a different puzzle. When you're in the worlds, you can solve the puzzles in any order that you want and at your own pace, which I find really nice.\n\nMake sure to fully explore the worlds as well. There are many hidden QR codes and terminals and secrets to discover.","December 11, 2014","true","14.9"," 261 of 292 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","261","292","5","13"

Believe the 10/10 net reviews. They are the truth.\n\nI hadn't heard of The Talos Principle and frankly can't remember where I heard of it. I think the PC Gamer RSS feed. No matter. I'll be the first to admit that puzzle games aren't in any way my genre of preference - I'm much more likely to be found playing games such as Unreal Tournament, Mechwarrior Online or a hard-core flight sim. Puzzle games, until now, really haven't captured my imagination or interest.\n\nThe thing that drew me to the Talos Principle was the notion that it combined a puzzle game, and a beautifully rendered one at that, with notions of the meaning of intelligence, the question of how "life" can be defined, what "artificial intelligence" would look like. I have a keen interest in philosophy, something that the reviews stated was very much at the center of the Talos Principle. So, I decided to take the plunge and I'm *extremely* glad that I did so.\n\nThe game is beautifully presented. The Serious engine (as in the FPS game Serious Sam) presents a very nicely rendered world. Each of the puzzles is set in themed ancient Roman, ancient Greek or medieval settings. Having recently spent a week in Rome the ancient Roman themed portions were very familiar and very well representative of ancient Roman remains.\n\nThe puzzles themselves ramp up very well in terms of difficulty, with early ones being very simple to solve. Later puzzles and in particular special puzzles that grant access to bonus areas can be absolutely fiendish. That being said, unlike most puzzle games I've never given up in disgusted frustration - the puzzles and tools that you unlock to assist you are intuitive enough to make you want to solve the puzzle to progress or to unlock more of the thematic content.\n\nSpeaking of which, this game is superbly grounded in philosophy, well presented themes from science fiction and indeed theology. Far from being a simple solve-this-puzzle-then-on-to-the-next, this game makes the player really think about such questions as who they are (in game), what they are and whether you are in fact merely a metaphorical rat in a maze. It should be noted that the game absolutely does not require any knowledge of philosophy or sci-fi tropes, but if you are familiar with the concepts developed by the likes of Soren Kierkegaard, Lev Shestov, Carl Sagan or A.C. Clark the game is absolutely that much more immersive and enjoyable.\n\nI'm really, really impressed by the Talos Principle on many different levels. This is one of the most intelligently designed and presented games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Everything from the graphics, quality of the voice acting, in-game presentation, music, even the controlls have obviously been developed with a lot of thought.\n\nBored of yet another generic, mindless, so-called "AAA blockbuster" game that was identical to the last 5? Give this game a try, you'll be amazed and impressed by how fun it is to play and perhaps more importantly how it makes you really think.\n\nAbsolutely 10/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelios/recommended/257510/","xelios","Xelios","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelios/","4978 products in account","I’ve been pleasantly surprised by games before, but never have I been so biased against a game prior to its release then subsequently impressed by every aspect of it upon playing. “From the developers of Serious Sam, one of my least favorite franchises. I bet I will really enjoy this,” I sarcastically said to myself when the pre-order page went up. I did enjoy it. It is wonderful. It is easily one of the best games I’ve played.\n\nThe Talos Principle is one giant existential question that can be answered through solving over one hundred smaller, physics-based puzzles under the guidance of your maker, Elohim, whose intimidating voice attempts to influence you from above at every turn. This might seem a strange way to label the game’s genre, but it’s accurate and the story manages to never feel at all pretentious despite addressing philosophical subject matter. While the majority of your time is spent solving the smaller puzzles, it always feels as if you’re doing it for a higher purpose or to unravel the larger mystery looming overhead, so the game successfully maintains a careful balance where both the story and puzzles are one and equally important.\n\nThis journey takes you through several temple-like environments, each containing a number of doorways leading to distinct worlds. In each of these worlds, you’ll find several self-contained puzzle areas that can also occasionally interact with each other in an advanced way to reveal secrets, and you'll access computer terminals to gradually uncover lore, important context and bits of the story. Completing puzzles rewards you with pieces used to solve tetromino puzzles that unlock doors to new environments, even more puzzles, and new tools used to steadily increase puzzle difficulty and prevent them from becoming stale.\n\nSolving puzzles requires manipulating and avoiding mobile mines, turrets, laser beam connectors, fans and cubes, as well as cooperating with recordings of yourself replaying your actions, but it never gets frantic and you’ll never feel hurried. There’s no real dexterity or speed requirement here, so you can relax and figure things out at your own pace.\n\nInitially, puzzles aren’t very challenging but you’ll come to appreciate how increasingly clever they are. At some point, I thought I’d outsmarted the game only to discover later this isn’t possible and it was always meant to be so open and unrestrictive. The most difficult puzzles are only required if you want to find all of the secrets within the game and discover as many answers as possible, which is highly recommended and completely worth the effort.\n\nThe Talos Principle takes itself seriously and explores concepts like faith, free will, humanity, loyalty and purpose, with your journey unfolding much like that of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden: In the beginning, you don't know or question much and simply follow instructions but, by the time you wander around and have your first taste of knowledge, you may develop a thirst for it and begin to question everything around you. It's easy to become completely engrossed in the setting.\n\nIf you don't enjoy reading in games and skip through text, you'll miss out on a lot of what makes The Talos Principle more than just another good game, but it's still worth playing even for the puzzles alone. On a technical level, the game is impeccable: graphics, sound, voice acting, controls and optimization are all top-notch, and there are even settings for proper AA and field of view. The environments are beautiful, as is the soundtrack.\n\nOn a final note, QR codes that reveal text are left behind on walls by NPCs and friends who have played the game before you, and you can also leave these pre-written messages for your Steam friends. One of these messages claims you’ve discovered the most beautiful spot in the game and, as there is a number of beautiful landscapes, I had been trying to decide where to leave that message for quite a while. I had been playing in first-person the entire time and ultimately left the message somewhere I never expected to: next to a mirror I encountered late in the game. It’s something that will only make sense if you end up loving the game as much as I do, but it was completely appropriate.","April 19, 2015","true","25.2"," 91 of 99 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","91","99","0","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/257510/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","The Talos Principle is a puzzle game developed by Croeam and published by Devolver Digital. It was released on Steam in December 2014, before later being released on PS4 in October 2015.\n\nThe game play within Talos could be considered very similar to that of Portal. You can play in either first person or third person, as you are presented with tons of puzzles on every stage. Each stage you complete, you unlock a new tool that you will need to use in some form in the following stage. I really liked this way of introducing new mechanics to the game as it lets you get to grips with the previous set very easily before dumping a ton of new stuff on you again. The puzzles start off quite easily as you would expect in the game but they soon take a very high difficulty rise, meaning I was completely stumped for the most of my play through. There is an element of trial and error with a lot of the puzzles as there is a quick reset button to use that takes you right back to the start of the puzzle and you will end up having to do this a lot.\n\nGraphically I was very impressed with The Talos Principle; it looks clean and fresh with extremely high production values. The lighting and weather effects in the game are stellar and really take it to a new level of quality. I was playing at 4k with the majority of the settings turned up to the max, apart from antialiasing. I did however get motion sickness whilst playing in first person view; I think it was a mixture of the speed that the character was traveling at and the motion blur. I had to eventually switch from first person to third person and this solved the problem. The game runs on Serious Engine 4 – this is the only game to use it so far, but it is almost identical to serious engine 3 and 3.5 which were used in the latest Serious Sam titles.\n\nI found the plot to be very interesting, having really enjoyed Greek mythology from other games, my interested was peeked from the get go. There are a lot of extra bits of plot and lore to learn about through collectables and computer terminals for you to access as you explore the different levels. I took a lot of time to seek them all out to learn as much as possible.  The game has various different endings as well depending on how you progress throughout your play through.\n\nLike I said above, the difficulty really scales quite highly as you get past the first or second stage of levels. I had to use walkthroughs to even come close to finishing the game and even then I struggled and had to refer to videos as well! Whilst I found the game play to remind me a lot of Portal, the difficulty is certainly on a different scale compared. If you plan on playing this game without the aid of guides or wikis, then you are in for a real brain twister as some of the solutions to puzzles are so far out of the box that they were not even on my radar.\n\nI finished the game in just over twenty hours, so there is a lot of content, even for someone who thought I was completing the puzzles quite quickly with the guides. Not to mention the game’s various different endings you can explore too. There are a lot of achievements you can unlock in each of the puzzles throughout the game, which may add some replay ability on as well.  Personally I find myself not wanting to go through again purely because I am normally not a massive fan of puzzle games.\n\nI didn’t have any technical problems apart from the motion sickness issue as noted above, the game runs very well on 4k resolution at 60+ fps. It looks to be a very well optimized engine that I will be eagerly anticipating what else comes out of it. The game can be played with a controller but given the movement and preciseness of some of the actions you have to take, I would strongly recommend using a keyboard and mouse.\n\nMy conclusion on The Talos Principle is quite simple. If you are a fan of mind bending puzzles with really obscure solutions to them, then you are going to absolutely love this game. If you are like me and are only going to manage the first two stages without a guide, you may want to err on the side of caution with your purchase. Whilst I am going to recommend this game, it definitely gets a lot of bonus points from the extremely high productions values on show from the start right until the final scenes. As someone who has the brain like a sieve and finds the puzzle side of the game to be difficult I didn’t enjoy it as much as other games.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

However this is very much the case as The Talos Principle is a fascinating and mentally invigorating experience with clever puzzles and a highly intriguing philosophy laden science fiction backdrop. The game slowly generates an atmosphere of mind-bending contemplation unlike anything I have experienced before in games thanks to a potent mixture of clever writing and music that starts to get under your skin. I think only 2001 A Space Odyssey has given me the same feeling before.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are the star of the show however with a good difficulty curve and consistently excellent design. Some puzzles which have you dodging floating mines can be annoying, but the vast majority require clever thinking rather than quick reflexes or good timing. The puzzles are short but require you to use existing mechanics in new and surprising ways. The game lets you figure almost everything for yourself, from the story to the mechanics, but the world and puzzles are laid out in such a way that this is generally not a problem. There are loads of secrets/optional challenges that help add further substance to the game after you finish working through the main set of puzzles.

Some I breezed through, some required some head scratching, and a couple required coming back a couple times with fresh perspectives - and all felt good and rewarding at the end. Super satisfying.\nThat's just the normal puzzles, though. The gold star puzzles wrinkled my brain in a good way - I'd say I got maybe 60% unassisted, and the rest kicked my ♥♥♥ (most of them in a good way, although there were a couple that I never would have gotten). A fantastic stretch if you really wanna go the extra mile.\nAnd the last layer on top of the puzzles and gold stars is the easter eggs - they're everywhere. Some are easier to find than others, but oh man, they're everywhere, very clever, and stealthily hid. I found three out of I can only assume dozens.\n\nPlotA puzzle game is all well and good, but how is it tied together? Portal did so in a comedic meta way - Portal 1 was pretty much all comedy, where Portal 2 did have a bit of a plot to piece together. The Talos Principle has comedy, but each puzzle draws you closer to piecing together the whole story, which is very compelling. It's a clever premise well executed that absolutely adds to the mechanic.\nAnd I really did love the story here. Plenty of little bits and pieces to keep you interested, building the world as you went. From reading texts to hearing audiologs to reading QR codes left by others, it all merges together to make a fantastic experience.\n\nAnd yes, I cried at the end. While there are games for which this wouldn't be a surprise, this one did surprise me. It's a puzzle game! But the whole thing was so artfully executed I couldn't help but get drawn in. Beautiful and poignant and sad and hopeful and amazing.\n\nI look forward to playing it again. <3","April 20","true","24.2"," 76 of 80 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","76","80","2","0"

I was pleasantly surprised by the ending.\n\nThe game foreshadows issues and ideas around artificial intelligence that could potentially become very real in the next century or so, and for a game that's very impressive.

It was as if this game was specifically made for me.\n\nThe most important things for me in single player games are:\n\n- the quality and inventiveness of the mechanics—and whether or not I can manipulate them in a meaningful way\n- immersion (which usually means first-person perspective, excellent sound design, etc..),\n- the writing/story\n\nRegarding mechanics, combat-focused games are the majority in the industry—especially on PC and especially in first-person games—so those that aren’t centered on combat often must work more creatively to be interesting—games like Myst (1993) and Portal (2007). This is also true of games which have combat, but also offer non-combative methods to play through the game (stealth/sneaking, for example)—ie., Deus Ex (2000), Splinter Cell (2002), and Dishonored (2012). These are my favorite types of games—especially the latter, perhaps because the avoidance of combat adds a further complication to the mechanics of gameplay. So, I was really excited about the First Person Puzzle design of Talos when I played the demo at PAX Prime 2014. It was love at first sight in the demo booth. I had trouble getting through the last couple demo levels on my first try, but it was still extremely satisfying and fun. As I sat struggling with the connectors and fans and boxes, of the fellows from Croteam warned me the Enforcers were coming to run everyone out of the Indie Megabooth, but told me to come back the next day to finish the demo—they’d get me back where I’d left off. So I went back the next morning, finished the demo, and gushed to Croteam about how interesting I found the game and how excited I was to play it on release. I tried to explain that it reminded me of playing Deus Ex and System Shock 2. It’s hard to articulate exactly how Talos relates to these types of games, but they all give me the same kind of satisfaction upon completing an area, even if the mechanics and design are quite different—the end feeling as a player is similar, so there’s some kind of overlap in how the gameplay works on the player. And the first-person immersion helps with that. (I should note here that you can play the game in third-person and easily switch between first- and third-person. I simply prefer first.)\n\nMore on gameplay: the puzzles were great. I found the most satisfying bits to be finding the optional stars because I had to find ways to “break” the game (or at least The Great Voice in the Sky’s intentions… hehe) to get them. The puzzles in general—sigils, stars, and easter eggs—had that kind of excellent satisfaction to them—some of them were teaching the player the possibility of the mechanics, while others encouraged the player to break beyond the narrow way in which puzzle/first-person mechanics usually work. As I mentioned, in some ways Talos really reminded me of experiences playing the original Deus Ex and System Shock 2; there were ways to play those games that literally did break them, just because of the limitations of game development/AI functionality at the time. That’s not to mention that they had multiple routes to play the levels built in already. Talos also achieved the same type of feeling that the Half-Life games produce where it feels like you’re breaking the game—pulling one over on the level designers and outsmarting the game—but in reality that is because levels were designed so well. They were built in a way to teach you to break the limitations and expectations of regular gameplay. I remember the first time I got stuck in Half-Life and after I searched every possible route out of the area, realizing I could climb on the pipes to escape where I was—like, I was so shocked that there was platforming in my FPS! I remember feeling as if I was outsmarting the game, but looking back, of course there really was no other way to get out of the level. Yet it was built in a way that made that fact satisfying instead of frustrating.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning: the QR codes. Without saying much, there is functionality built into the game to leave messages on the walls for other players (people on your Steam friends list) to see later. It might seem like a small thing—but it really was a great little touch and made the game even more immersive.\n\nSo I was super hyped for Talos’s gameplay, and it still delivered beyond my expectations. But I gotta say that the writing and storyline was on the same level, in really impressive ways. It was subtle but powerful, and—without saying too much—I liked how it played with the ideas of free will and game-imposed confines of “choice”. I guess what I mean is, the game—mechanics-wise—were already top notch quality and impressive. But the story—the character development through audio logs, the slow revelation of the story through classical literature and other text artifacts, the QR codes, the interactions with the terminals—made it even richer. Basically Talos combined all of my favorite aspects about video games in a really fresh, great way. And it also took advantage of some of the best avenues that science fiction opens up for those ever-important literary questions... “What is the world like, and what does it mean to be human in that world?” Despite the rambling nature of this post, I actually double majored in Literature and History at university. So this game just... I feel like this game was made for me. And I was made to play it! (All that said—if you’re not interested in story, you can completely ignore and not investigate any of that and still enjoy the game for its excellent mechanics. But I’d still recommend getting into the story!)\n\nAll in all, I recommend it 100%. Well designed, highly polished, and super cool devs!","January 29, 2015","true","65.7"," 81 of 90 people (90%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","90","81","90","8","0"

Эта компания всегда занималась мясными шутерами, с кишками, оторванными конечностями, кровью и т.д. Вдруг выходит игра "The Talos Principle" Сразу задается вопрос, что это? Это филосовская игра, с необычным сюжетом и атмосферой. Компания, которая всегда занималась мясными и зубодробительными шутерами, вдруг выпускает спокойную и миролюбивую игру? Этот факт навел на меня ооочень большое любопытство. Я начал активно следить за игрой, смотреть трейлеры и т.д. И вот настал момент, когда я её купил. Как только я появился в этом мире, меня охватило чувство таинственности. Кто я? Робот? Какого черта я робот?! Что за голос говорит со мной с небес? Что мне нужно делать? Именна эта особенность, делает атмосферу этой игры незабываемой! Всю игру нам предстоит не только тупо решать головоломки, но и следовать филосовскому сюжету и смыслу. А филосовские тексты в данной игре, могут даже дать пару жизненных уроков и поводов для размышления. Даже головоломки несут в себе смысл в этой игре. Играя в неё, вы одновременно думаете и наслаждаетесь этой игрой. Даже если вы не особый любитель философии, здесь вы все равно найдете потрясающе интересные головоломки, красочные и живописные виды (я их заскриншотил и поставил на рабочий стол), великолепное музыкальное сопровождение и удовольствие от прохождения! Это нечто больше чем игра...\n\n\nОценки особенностей игры:\n[Графика: 8.5 из 10]\n[Сюжет: 10 из 10]\n[Музыка: 11 из 10]\n[Дизайн уровней: 9.5 из 10]\n[Озвучка: 10 из 10]\n[Атмосфера: 12 из 10]\n\n{[ Общий итог: 10 из 10 }]\n\n\nВывод: Игра очень необычная и не похожа на другие игры, отличный филосовский сюжет, неплохая графика, интересные уровни и головоломки, великолепная музыка и незабываемая атосфера.

This is nothing like the uninspired, unoptimized cash-grabbing console ports we are used to nowadays.\n\nBut let me correct myself. This is not just a game, it is an experience. The talos principle will make you question your existence, your purpose in life. Even if you aren't really into philosophy, it will make you go look up some quotes of famous philosophers.\nEvery aspect of it is superb, the riddles, the visuals, the atmosphere, the music, everything works out.\nDon't expect it to hold your hand though.

Definitely worth checking out if you want a smart game that'll actually challenge you to think (outside the box too). It's actually rare to find a game experience like this nowadays that isn't all about linear action or a single "goal" but more progressing at your own pace and provoking thoughts about the world you're in. Well optimized with great graphics too.\n\nDifficulty is lenient unlike in many other puzzle games and you're not forced to complete every single puzzle which is a huge plus. Instead, should you face an "unbeatable" puzzle (as you no doubt will, there's plenty of them :P) you can just opt to go to another area for an easier puzzle instead. And the world to explore is huge and you have no shortage of various puzzles to engage in, so the possibility of getting "stuck" is much lower than in other games of its kind.\n\nAll this coming from a developer that previously made much simpler Serious Sam shooters, so give them some props, this game deserves your attention.

The puzzles range from just walking around doing them without having to think to complex brainteasers.  luckily you don't need to complete every puzzle to advance so if something is just taking up your time with no progress you can come back later.\n\nThe game is about being an android and solving puzzles for god, while questioning if you really are 'alive' or not.  I'm not going to spoil anything about the story except that there are multiple sides.  The game does require a significant amount of reading if you want to understand what is actually going on, and while encouraging exploration through the various mini-hubs there is no actual need to.

But, in reality Portal pioneered an entirely new genre mashup that had never been done before.  So, yes, The Talos Principle is in the same genre.  Once you get past that, the overall experience of Talos is unbelieveably entertaining, unique, and frankly mind-blowing.\n\nSome highlights:\n+ Puzzle difficuly progression is engineered to perfection.   Just like Portal! :D\n+ The graphics and ambiance aren't state of the art, but they are absolutely perfect for the game.  Art direction is Oscar worthy.\n+ The story from start to finish is a masterpiece of expectation engineering.  You think you know what the point is.  But you really don't.\n+ If you've paid attention to all the details of the various story arcs, you will walk away from the game feeling like you just experienced three distinct but bound stories.  This game is like getting three experiences in one.  It's a hell of a deal.\n+ There are fascinating side game mechanics that are really rewarding if you decide to spend the time.\n+ You can cheat.  But it's as if the engineers designed the cheating mechanics on purpose.  It's possible to get lost for hours trying to find ways to hack various challenges.  In other words, don't assume there is only one way.\n+ It's been a LONG time since I've played a game with refined movement mechanics and keyboard control of this caliber.  It's unbelieveably well thought out.  +5000 to the QA team for working this all out.\n\nNumber one reason to play:\nIf you REALLY take the time to ponder what's being suggested during the game, you will literally walk away from the game experience with an altered perspective on reality.  For the better!  IMO, this type of effect is priceless in a game.  A legit philosophical education wrapped in an unbelievably entertaining package.  Wow.

As the story progresses, Milton encourages the player to act independently, and motivates him to enter the tower and find out the truth for himself.\n\nGameplayThe game starts slowly by introducing gameplay elements (some of which are unlocked by solving specific puzzles) and the difficulty of the puzzles ramps up pretty fast, but they are never unfair - even if some of them may be excruciatingly hard. If there is a situation where the player may get stuck, it's because some specific mechanics and uses of elements aren't expected or explained beforehand. Example: some puzzles utilize your own body for intentionally blocking lasers, which the player himself might not think for some time. One thing that may get on some player's nerves is the reset ability, which you will use at some point to unstuck yourself from an unsolvable jam. It resets the entire room along with all the progress you might have made, which can be somewhat annoying in longer puzzles which take some time to progress through. Once you do solve a particularly tricky puzzle, you are glad you persisted and managed to solve it on your own. On most puzzles there is a shrine you can use to get a hint if you get stuck (although some hints are too vague and don't help as you might expect), but getting that hint requires solving some hidden puzzles which are not a part of the main story, but are worth exploring any ways as they have the most beautiful locations in the entire game. If you find yourself a bit short on hints, you may want to play Sigils of Elohim, a free companion mini-game in which you may get an additional 3 hints.\nThere are four worlds in the game, which go as follows:\nMediterranean - ancient Greek/Roman themed world\nEgypt - puzzles spread out in the desert, borrowed aesthetics from Serious Sam 3\nMedieval - typical medieval style with ruined castles in a forest\nTundra - the "main" world in which the tower and the three other hub worlds are located\n\nYou start your adventure in the Mediterranean world and gradually unlock the Egypt and medieval worlds with puzzles, which are spread out into different rooms in every world. You can play the puzzles pretty much in any order, which is welcome if you are stuck in a particular puzzle, so the player can skip that particular one for the time being and return later on with a fresh approach, unlike in fully linear games like Portal.\n\nVisualsThe game has some very nice visuals, particularly if you look at the texture quality (Example: look closely at the greek-style fresca scattered through the ruins of the first world, or just looking at the floor mosaic in the third world hub cathedral). There are some hidden locations with truly great visuals, so I definitely encourage anyone to explore the game fully, which will not go unrewarded. The game runs pretty well on older hardware, but don't expect wonders - the game likes stronger hardware, but it knows how to use it. If you played Serious Sam 3, you pretty much know what to expect, it's a visually slightly upgraded game, which is fine for my taste.\n\nSoundThis game has one of the best soundtracks this year, which you can listen for free in full here\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J2xolKQjs8\nIt's one of the few games where I didn't have to turn the music off after some time as it blends in fantastically with the game. If you buy the sountrack DLC now, you might be a little bit dissapointed to find out that there's Elohim's voice in pretty much every track, making it a bit weird if you listen to the game's soundtrack in the public or at work. The game's developers promised to offer a versions without voiceovers, but we'll see.\n\nConclusionI haven't had this much fun with a game in years, and Croteam did a stellar job with this game. If you like puzzle games, especially Portal 2, pick this game up immediately, you definitely won't regret it. For now the game the game doesn't have content beside the main campaign and the prototype maps DLC, but they shipped the game with the editor and full Steam workshop integration, and already the community started putting out stuff days after release, so we might get an abundant amount of content as time goes on.","December 24, 2014","true","30.4"," 38 of 40 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","38","40","2","0"

I feel like I'm missing things in places where I "shouldn't" reach.\n\nSecond of all, all the philosophical text and incomplete messages are weird and interesting. The whole vibe of the game - with Elohim (God in Jewish) is the narrator guiding you around with a very clear biblical intent that may or may not be helpful to the player.\n\nSo, to wrap it up:\nA stunning world with a strange vibe to it with interesting puzzles.\n\nIt's not as fun as the Portal games - which were faster and more comic - but it's way more interesting and make you think more than you thought you should think while playing games. In my honest opinion - this of it's own is a great achievment for a video game.\n\nHighely recommended for all of you thinkers who don't care spending hours wondering around in an unexplained world searching for stuff you didn't know you should have looked for in the first place.

I don't think I've ever had such an emotionally exhausting love-hate relationship like this with any other game I've ever played. It was like being in an abusive relationship. The first 10-15 hours of the game were exhilarating, narratively interesting, and created a strong motivation to see what was in each new puzzle room/world, but over the next 10-15 hours it gradually descended into a painfully dull, repetitive, utterly frustrating exercise in endurance. Towards the end I kept going back *just* to complete it, because sometimes it was *still* fun (and I was desperate for narrative closure), but most of the latter half of the game was just mind-numbingly frustrating, like nothing else I've ever played. I almost wanted to cry in frustration during the final levels.\n\nSo... at the start, the game sets up the world and teaches you the mechanics of the puzzles extremely well. The graphics are beautiful, the voice acting is superb, and the story is slowly unveiled to you through terminals and audio logs found throughout the world, which (initially) gives a strong motivation to explore everywhere in the hope of discovering little secrets about the overarching story. Each few sets of puzzles introduce new tools you can use to solve the puzzles, which keeps the puzzling entertaining and fresh during the first half of the game. I felt a real sense of progression and reward, and was itching to see what was in the next room and on the next terminal.\n\nProblems start to begin somewhere in the second world, about 10 hours in. It becomes clear that there are just WAY too many puzzles with too little variation. There is a very long time where no new puzzle solving mechanic is introduced, where it begins to feel like you're doing the same thing for almost every single puzzle, albeit in a slightly more complicated fashion each time. It's also during this time that the story starts to become stale and predictable. I won't spoil it, but believe me: very little of note is revealed to the player after the first half of the game. The exact same themes are covered over and over again, but the themes aren't exactly *that* complicated to begin with. It starts to feel like a prolonged philosophy 101 seminar debate. What is life? Are robots alive? What is consciousness? Can robots be ethical? Is God real? Should you obey God? Interesting questions the first time they are discussed, but pretty dull after being re-stated over and over (and believe me, they are re-stated so many times with so little variation). Also, the overarching point of the game world and the (main) ending are extremely obvious quite close to the start of the game. By the time I eventually completed it, I wasn't even slightly surprised. It felt like an obvious narrative going through the motions to reach it's obvious conclusion.\n\nAll of this is a monumental shame, because the first 10 hours were an absolute joy. I would have given this game a glowing review had I written this 15 hours ago. But now... I just can't. I never want to see another ♥♥♥♥ing connector, another fan, or another jammer again in my life. The developers took a beautiful thing and ran it into the ground.","July 6, 2015","false","30.6"," 288 of 458 people (63%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","63","288","458","37","28"

I didn't really believe it when people said it was a better puzzle game than Portal. In truth, it is. I brute-forced or even accidentally completed a fair number of Portal puzzles, but every single solution in the TALOS Principle arose from an "Aha!" moment. I was having such fun with the puzzles, that after completing the main story I went back and started hunting down more stars. I never do bonus objectives! I'll admit that I gave up a few puzzles into the first bonus world, but it was from sheer mental exhaustion. I may someday dive back in for 100% completion.\n\nAnd, I'm extremely proud to claim, I never once looked for help for a single puzzle. I think this was largely due to the relatively loose structure of the game. Stuck on one puzzle? There's a dozen more waiting for your attention. I could knock out a few other puzzles, and then return with renewed confidence to the difficult one. For especially tough puzzles, sleeping on it usually allowed for a trivial solve the next day.\n\nThe story is largely conveyed though text snippets found in computer terminals scattered throughout the worlds. It's mostly inferred, rather than stated outright. The "good ending" was quite satisfying, clarifying the central "mystery" while leaving still leaving a lot of the backstory to the player's imagination. The story is also heavily philosophical, and brought back many pleasant memories of my university Philosphy and Cognitive Systems classes. This game, puzzles and all, made my head hurt less than some dense philsophical essays we were assigned to read. In fact, I think you could design a pretty good class around this game, with each game section leading to additional readings and class discussions.\n\nHighly recommended.","April 29","true","16.7"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","29","31","2","0"

The screenshots and the game description made me think this way. But The Talos Principle isn't like Myst at all. Instead, this game is quite similar to Portal. That's fine. I enjoyed both Myst and Portal very much. The only difference is that The Talos Principle is magnitudes better than Portal. It's simply THAT good.\n\nAt the time of this review, I've played this game for 42 hours. And I'm only about 80% done. Plus I have the DLC to look forward to. I bought The Talos Principle during a sale, but it's easily worth buying it even at full price.\n\nEdit:\n\nOK, I've now played this game for about 71 hours, and I've completed the entire base game plus the DLC.  The Talos Principle really delivers on quality to the absolute end.  If anything, the last 5-10 hours of the game were some of the most fun and intriguing.\n\nRoad To Gehenna is a really good DLC that adds new elements to the game.  For example, the computer terminals are significantly more interactive, and the story is richer than in the original game.  Plus, some of the puzzles in the DLC are geographically enormous, spanning hundreds of feet in all directions, including vertically.  New characteristics like these are part of what makes Road To Gehenna seem much more like a sequel than a DLC.  It's definitely worth buying.","November 9, 2015","true","71.1"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","32","37","5","0"

They went and made a philosophical video game that explores the nature of humanity, defining terms and shedding light on important virtues along the way.\n\nJust as poetry can be beautiful when it embodies its own expressed sentiments, the Talos Principle's gameplay and story beautifully embody its messages. I am really impressed by it. I even consider it an exemplary video game.\n\nThe game's story and setting reveals itself to the player by allowing itself to be explored and investigated. It's completely mysterious when you start, but a curious person will quickly get a handle on what's really going on. The satisfaction of overcoming puzzles, coupled with the satisfaction of coming to new understandings about the game's setting (and perhaps new understandings of practical philosophical concepts!) is a very nice mix, and fits the flavor of the game very well. It's all about the search for truth.\n\nThe gameplay is about as good as a first/third person puzzle game gets. Mechanics are gradually introduced to the player, and their implementation increases in sophistication as the game progresses. No one mechanic is the focus of the game, and they all feel powerful when used, despite their variety. Hidden goodies are very well hidden, and it's genuinely rewarding to discover secrets in this game. Secrets are a thing that have been mostly absent from most video games as of late, so that's just one more to add to the list of refreshing things implemented in the game.\n\nThe graphics and music of the game are beautiful, and I am not using "beautiful" as a buzzword here; the text files and messages the player can find strewn through the game will do a good job of defining beauty as a term, as will the stunning sunsets and detailed terrain. Watching the light trickle through the greenery and authentic architecture never gets old for me. The music for each area is sublime. It's not distracting or grating at all, perfectly suited for having a nice think.\n\nSomething that the full game has that the demo didn't have is the well-written handful of characters (other than MLA and ELOHIM) that you'll see evidence of throughout the game. You'll find philosophical discussion between them written on the walls in QR code, or various arguments put forth by writers of text files that may be found on computer terminals strewn through the land. Each character is very believable; their personalities range from cynical to hopeful to genuinely curious. I found myself captivated by them, because they said stuff that I've heard from real people in real life. Whoever did the writing for this game is top notch. I'd even say it's a bit overkill for the medium of video games, and right now I can't think of another game that matches it.\n\nThe Talos Principle has become my favorite singleplayer game. I bought the full game after just a few minutes of exposure to the demo and I have no regrets; I really enjoy this game's heartening messages, and I can see myself just wandering around in it for a while. I'm jealous of the guys who conceived and developed this game, they should be proud. It is an absolutely authentic creation. I'd be happy if more people were exposed to this game. I think anybody who has an ounce of curiosity in them should give it a shot, and see what they can discover.","December 13, 2014","true","27.9"," 42 of 54 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","42","54","0","0"

And you do as you’re told. Why? That’s what you have to ask yourself over the course of the game.\nThe puzzles are very easy in the first two levels, but starting from the third level, they really step up a notch.\nYou start off by using a very simple tool (the jammer), with which you can shut down electrical devices, later on you can unlock more and more devices to bypass even more enemies or obstacles and sometimes you have to combine some of them in a completely new way or just change your point of view to reach the Tetris style jigsaw piece.

And maybe that's the idea. Maybe its all meant to fit into how the game reminds you that life is in itself a puzzle, that the nature of humanity is an aspect that's very tricky to translate into the languages we've come and developed over the many years of our species' existance, that even in our advances, even with all the new tools we'll come and develop or aquire for ourselves, even through all the knew mechanics we'll establish for us and our fellow man, life...is just always going to feel like nothing but a never-ending series of puzzles to ponder over, and no matter how many different ways you try to look at it, or how many ways you try placing that box or that jammer, and no matter how many times you'll wander around in the vain hope of finding just one last laser reflector...\n\nTHIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

Buy it and try it, without reading anything about it. Talos Principle is well worth your money. It would be if it was 60 bucks even. It's a crime to buy it at it's current price.\n\nNow for the proper review - Talos Principle is a puzzling game, in more than one way. It has incredibly well designed puzzles for the ones looking for a surface level puzzle game, but it also puzzles your mind - your beliefs, your thoughts, your humanity. If you want to go deep down the philosophical rollercoaster that Talos Principle offers, get ready for many loop-de-loops, spirals going down and many other things that will make you barf your mind out.\n\nGameplay wise, Talos is very solid. It offers incredible gameplay, with very well thought and increasingly challenging puzzles. If you're aiming for 100%, get ready for some massive out of the box thinking. 100%ing it without any help is NOT for the faint of heart and will require a LOT of thinking. With that said, if you're not THAT hardcore (like me), there are guides that will partially aid you in your quest. I recommend, as an easier challenge, looking up the star locations and trying to figure out how to get them at first. There is also a pack with puzzles that didn't make it into the final game - over 100 of them. I absolutely recommend buying that pack along with it, if you think the already big sized game isn't enough for your fix.\n\nStory wise, Talos is ♥♥♥♥ing impeccable. Each and every bit of story is impeccably done, and you're doing yourself a disservice if you don't explore at least the story contained in the main monitors. Reading is part of the game, if you want to understand the nuances of the story, a concise entanglement of many philosophical questions, theories and literatures that will make you think about how small but significant (or not) you are.\n\nOne BIG problem with it though, and that goes for all brazilians reading this review: This game has the WORST localization I've EVER seen. EVERYTHING is wrong. Then again, I blame the translation studio - Please, Croteam, don't EVER hire Studio Nixa or Gorgone Productions EVER, for ANYTHING.\n\nOn another hand, the voices of Elohim and Alexandra, Gil Cardoso and Zuleica Alem, did a fantastic job. HUGE props to them!\n\nMusic and sounds wise, this game is also spectacular. The tracks go from calming ambience to sort of sad and depressing   tunes - I absolutely recommend buying the OST along with the main game. It's ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.\n\nReplayability will eventually be high, as this game also has Workshop support.\n\nAll in all, this game will stand the test of time - it's puzzling nature and excellent writing will make it still be a cult classic at the very least 10, 15 years from now.\n\nThe only (and small) con with this game is that, in some areas, it was really easy to break. I could exit some puzzle areas with some unintended pieces and managed to get some stars via some unintended clipping.\n\nBut then again, I am a human being with free will.\n\nTalos Principle, 9,5/10!","December 22, 2014","true","46.8"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","24","29","3","0"

After reading the store page and reviews I was really excited for the game. I immediatelly downloaded the Demo version and just after some twenty minutes I knew that I absolutely have to have this game.  And I don't regret buying it at all.\n\nPuzzlesThe Talos Principle is logically challenging, starting with easy to solve puzzles but as you progress the difficulty slowly increases. However the real defficulty generally lies in the approach you take. Some levels may seem impossible to solve but once you make the first steps you realize that it was in fact easy all along.\n\nGraphicsThis game looks gorgeous even though the minimum specs are low. I played this game on a mid-range mobile GPU without any problems. I really like the games design and feel, it gives a special feel the game.\n\nHighly philosophicalThroughout the game you will be talking to the Milton AI who will be asking deep questins about your views uppon the world and some of your opinions. These were so fitting to the story and gameplay that they made me question not just the in-game world but our own real world as well. Sometimes I just had to stop playing and think about them. However there is one thing worth mentioning and that si: You don't have go through this part of the game at all but you will miss a lot.\n\nSoundtrack and voicesThe audio is deffinitely the best one I've had the opportunity to hear.

I have rarely been so inspired and interested in a puzzle game (or almost any game for that matter) before, including the Portal games that I am comparing it to so much. The puzzles in this game require very serious thinking and have many different parts and layers that you have to always be paying attention to if you want to be able to solve it. And, for such a small map that seems so confined and limited, there are many things to do and easter eggs to find and even 3 different endings you can choose from. I recommend you look EVERYWHERE if you want to get about half the achievments or to find any easter eggs. You are also able to do most of the puzzles in the game out of order. The voice acting (at least the two voices you hear in the game) is just as great as the puzzles or the rest of the game really. The graphics and textures are gorgeous and pretty much flawless. I just about cried about 20 different times listening to the soundtrack. The controls and the jump/placement helper in the game make it very much accesible for even the worst of mouse and keyboard gamers. The game isn't really about completing it as fast as possible or for fast-paced action, I can almost guarantee you my 58 year old mom would beat it in half the time I took.\n\nSo, you like puzzles and philosophy? Get the game, it's definitely worth the 40 bucks.

A journey which will I am sure live with me for some time.\n\nThis game comes with my highest possible recommendation, buy it buy it right now seriously!!  I cannot believe I purchased this on a whim during a steam sale and then let it sit in my library for two months before I started it.  As I came back to review this game one thing stood out, the tag associated INDIE!

I am impressed. I personally known Croteam as makers of Serious Sam ... run,gun,fun and seeing them joining forces with Tom Jubert (FTL, The Swapper) and Jonas Kyratzes (The Sea Will Claim Everything) to create a PUZZLE GAME was a surprise.\n\nNow I wont be talking about the story since its something that should be experienced though can say that the idea is something like Stanley Parable. Now lets talk about the puzzles.\n\nYour point in the game is to collect sigils(tetronimos) that you later gonna use in puzzles(Sigil of Elohime). There are 3 kinds of sigils serving different purpose: green are needed to unlock areas, orange - unlock tools, red - for the tower(its one of the endings,nugh said).Each area contains 7 islands filled with puzzles that you should solve.You start the game with jammer and with collecting orange sigils you unlock more tools. So on and so forth to the end. Puzzle's difficulty starts low and increases with each area.\nIf you like reading you can take a look at computer terminals on each island  to reveal more parts of the story in the game. Also in the world you can find time capsules with recorded message also serving part in the story.\nAnd for all hardcore collectors there are stars that are hard to obtain and often requires to link together parts from different puzzles on the island.\n\nGraphics : They are gorgeous and often breathtaking. You may stop doing puzzles for a moment to take a break and look at the environment around you. There are glitches in the texture but they are intentional because they have to remind you that you are in virtual world.\n\nSound : To be honest ... I was barely noticing it and the reason for that is it was fitting the moments.\n\nThere is one thing I didnt like in the game though : the fact that you cant save during puzzles so often you may need to redo something a lot of times until you figure it out.\n\nOverall if you want a tough puzzle game with a great story you need to get this when you can.

Its contribution to the genre is tantamount to perfection. Never before have my ideals, be they existential, philogynetic or otherwise attributed to the human existence, been so tried and yet affirmed. This game does not claim to have philosophical answers, in fact it acknowledges that such answers do not and cannot exist, but it still perpetuates bold and insightful philosophical commentary. If nothing else, I have scarce enjoyed semantics more than I did in playing this game and arguing with the damned library assistant.\n\nOn the gameplay side of things, 10/10. The intricacy and depth of the puzzle design in this game is remarkable. I was frequently reminded of Portal, not because of similar puzzle elements - though there were a few - but because of the precision of the puzzles in both The Talos Principle and Portal. However, I would venture to say that this game's puzzles outshine Portal's merely in numbers. I finished my first playthrough of Portal about an hour and a half in. I finished my first playthrough of The Talos Principle thirteen and a half hours in.

A "chamber"-based puzzle game featuring a philosophical story from a company that made games about shooting many, many, many aliens with crazy weaponry? Nonsense. Yet, for this exact reason, I think the game is all the better for it. Mechanically speaking, The Talos Principle is very simple: it only has about six puzzle gimmicks throughout the entire game: blocks, lasers, fans, platforms, cloning utilities, and pressure switches are the ones that immediately come to mind. Every puzzle contains on average two to four of these gimmicks. How does it not get boring? The answer is simple: impeccable level design.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this game has the favorite chamber focus to puzzle game level design that Portal started, but it uses this design focus to considerable advantage (something I'll talk about later with star sigils).  While I don't wanna go into the environmental design too early, one of this game's strongpoints is its ability to create very organic feeling worlds while still having very interesting puzzles involved herein. In total there are roughly 120 puzzles throughout the game (excluding star sigils), each one containing one sigil in the form of a tetromino at the end of the stage. These sigils are used for tetromino puzzles in which you have to fill in some form of a rectangle with the tetrominoes you obtain. This provides a nice aside from the environmental puzzle focus of the game.\n\nThere were only really three puzzles throughout the entire game that I wasn't a fan of, and that's solely because they were item babysitting levels. Other than that, there are some levels that have a bit of item babysitting, but the puzzle usually more than makes up for any potentially tedious backtracking, and there are some insidiously clever puzzles as well. Regarding the difficulty of the game, it's definitely got some puzzles that will stop you from time to time, but they're more toward the end of the game. Also, puzzles are roughly scaled by difficulty by the color of the sigil: green for easy, yellow for medium, and red for hard. There's also grey sigils in there as well, but these sigils are hidden behind star doors.\n\nStar doors are unlocked by the aforementioned Star Sigils, which are strewn throughout the stages. They can require you to complete the stage in a particularly efficient way, do some precarious platforming to smuggle items out of the stage, or just be hidden in a particularly hidden area. I had to look up a guide on some of these sigils as I am most definitely not one with the eagle-eyed individuals, but the ones that required puzzles/platforming were pretty challenging, but still fun. There really wasn't any "bad" star sigil to get, either. Star sigils aren't required to complete the game, but they are if you want one of the endings. Apart from that, they do add a pretty good additional challenge to the game if you so want it, and the way that it often requires use of elements from different puzzles - thus making it an area-wide puzzle - can be immensely satisfying to solve.\n\nThat pretty much sums this game in a nutshell: immensely satisfying. I've always said that any chump can make a game hard; it takes talent to make a game fun and hard. Croteam have that talent, and they've shown it in spades with this game. Despite only having six gimmicks, no puzzle really feels like the other, and they are all still very satisfying to solve. It's definitely a game I could see myself replaying, so if it's value you're wanting out of this game, you'll get it. Even without replays, you can still get a good 16-20 hours out of this game. Despite how much I love Serious Sam, I think this is my favorite Croteam game. It's just... sublime. 10/10.\n\nStory: I've got a thing for stories that go hard on philosophy. If you're looking for a straightforward plot, you'll probably be disappointed. This game *requires* you to think about the story in order for you to understand it, but it never feels so vague that you need to look up outside material to truly get a grasp of what's going on. Of course, I would be remiss if I were to spoil such a story as this one, but I'll just say that three seemingly benign lines from one of the ending have been in my thoughts for most of the past 24 hours since I've gotten that ending. Regarding the characters, there's three main ones, but a lot of other side ones. You meet some of the side ones from time to time, and they do a very good job of feeling "real" within the context of the story. As far as the three main characters, two of them seem like archetypes, but there's more going on than what is immediately available at the surface. The third is a very well-written scientist who has quite the character arc in my opinion. Overall the writing does a very good job of reeling you in with its vagueness while also feeling very real given the circumstances, the characters are all pretty well done, and the philosophical material will give you plenty of pause, provided you give it the effort. 10/10.\n\nGraphics: The page's screenshots do a pretty good job of illustrating that this game is quite the looker, but I've got one screenshot on my page that I'd recommend looking at if you want an example of just how good this game looks in some areas. As mentioned earlier, this game has some fantastic environmental design that you need only look at that one screenshot to really see. Trees and grass sway in the wind, water splashes down from waterfalls, distorting the light behind it, radiant beams of light blind you with their power... this game just looks stupidly good. It's also really well optimized as well, even if it does prove a bit too much for my GPU to handle at times. It often hovered around 45-50 FPS with my GTX 760 with everything turned up to ultra and AA on 4x (the game did this automatically, which I was quite thankful for), but I don't think that was because of this being a poorly optimized game. Perhaps there were other things I could do to increase the FPS or perhaps my GPU is just derping it up, but it didn't matter; the fact that a game this pretty would run on my system at all at those specs more than makes up for a bit of choppiness.\n\nSpeaking of lighting, I've always loved Serious Engine's ability to make a sunny environment actually look like a sunny environment. Y'know, the kind of sunny day you really want some sunglasses for. Yeah, Serious Engine has always been a damned impressive engine from a relatively Indie team, and it does not disappoint in this game. I can't wait to see it in use for Serious Sam 4. However, this review is about The Talos Principle, and this game is simply gorgeous. Let's just say that the screenshot I keep going on about is my wallpaper and will be for quite some time. There's a lot of wallpaper-worthy scenes in this game, but in-game they run in real time. Excellent stuff. 5/5.\n\nSound: The soundtrack to this game, much like so much else in the game, is absolutely fantastic. They offer the soundtrack for $5, and I can say that the soundtrack is absolutely worth it for that price. It's mainly medieval-sounding pieces with associated Gregorian chants, but it just works so well within the context of the game. I could also see this soundtrack being great for just relaxing and creating your own art as well. It's a hefty download through Steam (1.8GB), but that's because there's FLAC versions of the song included. There's only two characters with voice acting throughout the game, ELOHIM and the scientist, and they both have fantastic voice actors, especially toward the end of their arcs.\n\nEven without the header, I've ran out of space, so I'll have the tail end of this and my final thoughts in a comment on this review.","January 5, 2015","true","36.5"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/christx4/recommended/257510/","christx4","ChrisTX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/christx4/","1530 products in account","The Talos Principle is an amazing first person puzzler experience held together by a story building on elements of philosophy. However, if you're looking at this game, you probably know that already. Yes, one could summarize a recommendation for this game as: "Liked Portal 2? Get this.". In all honesty, it is damn good.\n\nInstead of reiterating the same things everybody says about this game, I'd like to present maybe a more differentiated opinion, discussing what I did not like - make no mistake, the game is fantastic and I'd recommend it without hesitation, but even such games have flaws. If you're just wondering whether you should buy the game: Yes; yes, you should.\n\nIn this case, you're being presented a puzzler with distinguished rooms, between which you can switch and which unlock you sigils that you need to progress. Essentially these sigils are tetrominos that form sets which in turn once completed can be used to unlock new parts or to open doors.\nMy problem here is that these tetromino puzzles sometimes permit a logical approach implying certain symmetry relations or similar, so you can solve them using a determined strategy - but most do not. Especially tetromino sets consisting out of 14 parts feel rather tedious and time consuming, as they detoriate to a matter of trial and error, and ultimately trigger frustration.\nMore precisely, the messenger's abodes have four or more sigil sets, of which some are very large. Given the reward, a single messenger's tip, that helps you with ONE puzzle chamber, I do not feel that difficulty is justified. Solving four tetromino puzzles in a row doesn't exactly make you want to solve more of them: They just turn annoying.\nHad they eased on that components I feel the game would have had a somewhat better pacing.\n\nNextly, some puzzles later on just become tedious. Especially those with multiple mines in them can be frustrating as a single misstep will result in a reset. Moreover, the recorder part is demanding a large deal of concentration. It's very well possible messing a recording because you forgot to carry out one single step or had a bad timing on another, requiring a new recording and consuming time. In general, I like the part but felt it was never genuinely difficult to see how they want you to solve a given a puzzles, but rather the difficulty was in actually recording that solution properly..\nIt's a bit weird as some extra puzzles introduce some new mechanics unseen in the main puzzles. Again, it appeared to me the game would have profited from taking these mechanics and moving the tedious extensions in the extra puzzles instead. Oh well, there's a grey sigil puzzle named "Nerve-Wrecker" - which is really a very appropriate description thereof.\n\nFurthermore, a lot of text - both from QR codes and in-game messages - is 'enciphered' by just showing their ASCII representation in hexadecimal numbering, for example "I like 54 49 54 53!". I don't see the purpose thereof: Either you are technically adept enough to know what ASCII is, in which case this is something you translate maybe one of the messages and then ignore that or it is just confusing. There are some easter eggs related to this, but given the vast amount of text encoded in this form, you are very likely to miss them.\n\nLastly, I found the collectible stars being too easily missable. They can be hidden anywhere, inside and outside of puzzles and some stars can only be seen if you are in 3rd person mode. It took me quite some time to notice there was such a thing and even longer to learn that the increased vision thereof makes some stars unseen in the first person view visible. As of such, if you've missed a star, but have already solved all puzzles in the given world, you're bound to revisiting things you've already seen. This is even more problematic, as there are 30 stars in total and with 10 stars you can unlock an extra puzzle world, of which there are 3. So, if you want to visit all extra puzzles and complete the grey sigil set you need to find every single star. This is made worse by the fact that three stars are hidden outside of any puzzle world and thus cannot be located using the panels indicating the amount of stars/sigils of the respective world.\n\nEven more problematic is in my opinion that some stars are being hidden by arbitrarily arcane mechanics. Some examples:\nThere's a star accessed by connecting two invisible laser connectors. A cryptic QR code in the vincinity of the star is supposed to tell you that you're being expected to take a connector out of another puzzle and connect the two points with it. I learned this by peeking in a guide and even then had trouble finding the exact spots due to their invisibility.\nOne of the stars outside of any puzzle area is also hinted by a QR code. You're expected to align properly between two points and then walk over an invisible bridge. Problem? This again requires precision. I tried the hinted solution when I passed there the first time but slightly missed the path apparently. Later on, after considering a guide, and knowing what I was supposed to do, I tried it several times and succeeded ultimately.\nA rather early star puzzle is hinted by a QR code that the in-game reader does not decode. The game actually expects you to use your own smartphone, then decode the ASCII code in there giving you a date and a time. Around that, there are columns aligned like a clock and numerated where you are supposed to press the ones relating to the time. However, the clock is segmented in an unusual way (the incements are 1/20th, iirc) so you're supposed to enter the time hinted in that QR code by pressing the buttons of columns that would yield the nearest approximation to it.I've listed these three examples for a specific reason each: The first two ones give you no indication that the the solution is what the game expects you to do. Since they require precision, it is very well possible for the player to discard the actual solution as not being what you're supposed to do. The last one is very unmotivated. Given the aforementioned ASCII flood, why would you bother to decode exactly this single message? It's somewhat specially placed, but still very possible to dismiss it as some easter egg or bug rather than a puzzle. I mean, it was the only QR code not partially concealed by foilage that did not decode: I seriously thought this was a bug.\n\nMy ultimate impression all things considered is that they wanted to squeeze in as many puzzles as possible. Per se, that would be a good thing but tieing them all in with the story and with extras leads to the aforementioned issues I have with the game. Furthermore, the story feels at some points badly paced because small fragments that progress the narrative are separated by long puzzle sequences.\nWhile playing the game, I felt this giving it some pacing issues. What I mean is that the story would have could have also been presented with much smaller sets of sigils. Since you unlock the last part - the platform - with sigils of world hub B, world hub C consists only out of acquiring red sigils without adding a significant amount of new core ideas. Had they cut it down to say fewer worlds per hub and extracted the other puzzles in some extra unrelated to the story, I suppose the story's occasional drought periods would not have been there, while the game would have provided the same content, just in a different arrangement.","December 25, 2014","true","43.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","2"

If you liked either, you'll love this game.\n\nIt's very good and has proper challenging puzzles. The gameplay has depth and secrets. It looks beautiful even on low settings. Plus it's extremely well-optimized for running natively on Linux.\n\nThe design team definitely walks the line well between "too challenging" and "just challenging enough to keep you interested." There weren't any puzzles I was stuck on for too terribly long -- usually a good night's rest would help me when I came up against a wall.\n\nLike I said, the puzzles are in the same vein as Portal. The puzzles have more elements than Portal does, and the solutions come in about the same amount of time. The challenge in later levels is applying what you know about one element to another, and getting them to work together. It's really well-thought-out.\n\nThis game is deep. There's a lot to be discovered, and the solution to a mystery is gradually revealed to you as you play.

Puzzle designs are inventive, and it has got a decent (though at many times, vague) philosophical narrative.\n\nIf you've played a game like Portal and liked the puzzle solving there, then I suppose you'd like The Talos Principle as well. Some puzzles will have you stumped for a while, but thankfully the game has an "open" system where you can play puzzles in any order you like, so long as you have unlocked an area. Many times, I'd skip a difficult puzzle after pulling my hair out for an hour or two, only to return after playing all other puzzles in a given area to solve it within seconds or minutes. Perspective matters.\n\nIt's nice how the game has multiple endings based on how many puzzles you solved (there are basic puzzles, advanced puzzles, and then collecting stars), as well as depending on how well you listened to or disobeyed Elohim. And say you get Ending A...the game has a unique save system that allows you to go back a little in time to experience another ending, instead of needing to start a wholly new game. Though in one case, if you do something, it wouldn't lead to one particular ending no matter what.\n\nI solved every single puzzle, and it took me 20 odd hours to complete the game. I didn't go hunting for the stars though, cause that seemed quite challenging and I thought I got what I needed out of the game by then already.\n\nThere's also a text based choice mine-game with the computer program, that is kinda interesting.\n\nMy singular complaint would be that the game kinda drags along around the 2/3rds point. It definitely could have been condensed a bit more, something which the devs have admitted in their post-mortem. Also, it was kinda disappointing that the 3rd area looked a lot like the first area...would have been nice if there was a whole new setting/landscape. The visuals as such while impressive, did get boring after a while.\n\nOverall, I would say this is a great game. It has got multiple tiers of puzzles, so you can choose to do the easy ones, or the challenging ones, or the hardcore ones (getting all stars), and get "rewarded" accordingly with different endings. The narrative at times also makes you to pause and think for a moment, ponder over what was just said. Oh, and the soundtrack...SIMPLY AMAZING!

Bush","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_technus/","312 products in account","The game is set in beautifully nuanced, digitally simulated world with a bittersweet backstory told through found texts and voice recordings. It presents a compelling commentary on faith, technology, philosophy, and transhumanism while not taking a galvanizing stance on any of them.  There's a few pop-culture references and computing jokes sprinkled throughout the narrative, and I also found a hilarious easter egg.\n\nThe voice actors for Elohim and the girl in the recordings deliver a spectacular performance. I found myself very strongly emphasizing with the latter, to the point where by the end I just wanted to be able to find her and give her a hug and tell her everything is going to be okay.\n\nIt has a surprising amount of content for a (pseudo) indie game, very open-ended and for the most part, totally nonlinear. The gameplay is addicting, and rewards clever, creative solutions and a keen eye.\n\nHowever, some puzzles have entirely counterintuitive solutions while others are stupidly simple but horribly tedious. But this isn't entirely unexpected in a puzzle game, so I can't fault the devs for that. However, they seemed to rely a bit too heavily on red herrings and excess complexity to make some puzzles seem harder than they should be.\n\nThe Tetris-like 2D puzzles required to unlock new areas and tools were novel and enjoyable... the first few times. Then they started to become tedious. I think the devs could have come up with at least one or two more puzzle types for these parts to add some variety.\n\nThe "hints" the messengers give are usually painfully obvious and not really helpful. I found that often by the time I resorted to getting a hint, I had already figured out the part the messenger was hinting about and was stuck on something else entirely. The hint system could have been made more intelligent so it didn't tell you something you already knew. And since you only get a few of them throughout the game, the hints could have been a lot more useful than a vague sentence or two.\n\nFailure, such as dying or getting stuck and needing to reset, is extremely inconvenient as it resets you to the very beginning of the puzzle, making you lose all your progress, inside and outside the puzzle. This is especially frustrating on long puzzles with many intricate steps. But some might argue that failure should be inconvenient, as it incentivizes the player to put more thought and time into their solutions. So I guess this should be more of an FYI to potential players than a criticism.\n\nI like reading as much as the next guy, but I found that there was way too much to read for a video game. I think there's more written text in this game than all the Elder Scrolls titles put together (hyperbole). By the end of the game, I didn't really bother to read anything unless it seemed important. I would have liked to have the story told more in voice recordings from more characters and maybe even video logs, essentially more stuff that I can have playing while I'm running around or solving puzzles, and less stuff I have to stop and read.\n\nIf you're still reading after all that, I hope you understand that the disproportionate amount of time I spent on the game's flaws doesn't mean I didn't like it. In fact, I loved the hell out of it. It was an extremely enjoyable yet thought-provoking experience. Just as good as, if not better than, Portal and Portal 2 put together.\n\nMy only real complaint is that it had to end.","December 27, 2014","true","13.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

But what it lacks in portals it makes up for with a slew of other game mechanics. It also takes the linearity of Portal and enhances it tenfold with a more open-world hub-like approach. The writing of Tom Jubert and Jonas Kyratzes is top-notch and delivers a very interesting and thought-provoking story of philosophy, spirituality, religion, and science fiction.\n\nThere are countless worlds full of challenges to satiate your eager puzzle-solving OCD nature and countless layers and levels of secrets and easter eggs to keep you busy for quite a long time. Add to that the bonus handful of extra worlds and full blown expansion (Road To Gehenna) in the available DLC and you've got yourself a puzzle-packed adventure of intrigue and enlightenment that takes everything Portal did right and runs with it for a fantastic experience you won't forget and will enjoy every minute of.\n\nIf you love puzzle games, this is for you.

Year 2014 wasn't really rich for good puzzle games and Talos Principle was definitely a lovely addition to the end of spoken year and, I believe, definitely the best puzzle game of it.\n\nNow, the comparisons with Portal 1-2 is pretty much inevitable a t this point. And while most of the reviewers and people tend to draw direct parallels up to the point saying "it is a good Portal clone" - I have to strongly disagree.\nGood? Oh yes, indeed.\nClone? Not so much.\n\nAnd it is not just about the usual argument "well, duh, first person puzzle is not an exclusive genre introduced by Portal" but more about the fact that Talos Principle feels rather unique and genuine. Essentially, the game uses the same tools and instruments to represent slightly familiar gameplay, but it resolves around original core concept so it feels fresh. And that comes from a guy who quite a sucker for puzzle games.\n\nThe story aspect of the game is somewhat original in its position as well. Videogames tend to explore mostly technical aspect of Artificial Intelligence and consciousness (System Shock, Deus Ex, etc), but deeply philosophical? Not very often. Game's lore masterfully blends existing work on the subject with a fiction that does not deviate so much from its base material.\n\nVisual and technical sides of the game is a quite nice showcase of something I can call Serious Sam 3.5 engine. It is pretty. It is lovely. It is fast and customizable. The engine is very scalable, supports a lot of API natively and someone even managed to run and play the game on old IGPU with 32Mb VRAM,\n\nAll that being said, most of the criticism Talos Principle receives for its price. And while I do agree with some of the arguments on the topic - I do not regret my purchase in the slightest. More than that, since it is all goes to SS4 budget as well... yeah, win-win to me.\n\nLong story short: do you love Portal 1-2? Did you have fun with Antichamber? Do you like good puzzle games in general?

Even more so at the fact that it causes you to ponder philosophical quesions. Serious Sam is a 3D doom shootemup, not so big on story and philosophy. But, since they haven't failed me since they started making games nearly 15 years ago, i bought it.\n\nI'm not even finished yet and its probably in my top 5 games of all time. Since its an adventure puzzler, I'll do a quick comparison to Portal 2:\n\nPros:\n- Best damn responsive mechanics/controls in any game ever. Perfectly simple.\n- Higher difficulty end-game content (at least in my opinion)\n- Classic Croteam secrets. Plenty of em and ranging from easy to impossibly hidden.\n- Nostalgic Serious Sam feel. Same engine, tons of documents that make it feel like Netrisca, and even a visit to Egypt!\n\nCons:\n- Witty, but not nearly as humorous as Portal 2.\n- Price is scary. A lot of games in the genre flop, and most dont cost as much.\n\nAll in all, I like it better than Portal 2, Qube, or any other game like it. Get it!\n\n","January 2, 2015","true","21.7"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aizawaa/recommended/257510/","Aizawaa","crowbAr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aizawaa/","342 products in account","rating: worth buying at full pricescore: 10/10 - masterpiece\nsimilar games: The Swapper, Portal 2\ntarget audience: fans of puzzle games, narrative games\n\nWARNING: The Talos Principle is the first game EVER where I felt motion sickness. There are many options like an FOV-Slider, disabling View Bobbing and third person view to prevent this. For me personaly not using the sprint button was the best way (because sprinting is extremely fast in this game, for good reason).\n\nCroteam, the devs of Serious Sam, deliver their masterpiece with "The Talos Principle", a game which does everything right, where you literaly see how much effort they put into this game, how much detail, how much love. Talos Principle is one of those games where you can safely say that it belongs to the best this artform has to offer. It´s a game only an indie developer with a very high budget could make. The Talos Principle is my game of the year 2014.\n\nGameplayThe base gameplay of Talos is classic puzzling. You have many different puzzle elements and you have many different levels. Like in "The Swapper" you can choose which puzzles you want to solve first, it has a more open level design than games like Portal 2. This means if you are stuck at a puzzle you can just leave it and come back later and because of this the game has a really good flow, because you have always something to do.\nMost puzzles are in small areas, so you can quickly understand what you are supposed to do and there wasnt a single puzzle in the game where I had no idea what to do and I never had to look up something on a walkthrough. However there are sometimes really big puzzles where you first think "what the heck am I supposed to do", but these puzzles are designed in a way that at the beginning of the puzzles there is only 1 or 2 things you can do which dont really challenge you, but these things are there so you get used to the enviroment and dont feel completely lost. And these big puzzles are the really difficult ones where you feel really smart after you beat them.\nThe puzzles themselves are designed extremely well and their difficulty increases slowly but surely.\nThere are many more things you can do in this game, but those shouldnt affect your decision to purchase this game.\n\nNarrativeEven if the game doesnt have a huge narrative, constant cutscenes and tons of dialogue, I was always motivated to continue and eager to find out what this game was about. Not only is there a big mystery which you try to solve, in between you are confronted with philosophical questions where you have tons of choices to answer which lead to really interesting dialogues and I was thinking and guessing till the end of this game. It really makes you think, I mean REALLY, especially if you are someone who is interested in these kind of questions. If you are not though, these questions might get a little annoying at the end, but the nice thing is you dont have to do any of this.\nThis game has multiple endings and its one of the very very few games where having multiple endings makes sense, because they are not simply 3 different paths and you choose one. They are all connected and even if you get one ending, the others still matter in your story. At the end it was satisfying, interesting, thought provoking but also intense, even epic to a degree and it was nice to see how they created a climax for a puzzle game that works not only for its story but also for its gameplay.\nThere werent many voice actors for this game, but all of them did a great job, but there is also a lot of reading involved in this game which wasnt a problem for me and Im usually someone who skips notes and letters and stuff you find in other games.\n\nAesthetics"Wow this game is beautiful". thats what I thought many many times while playing this. Every "land" has its own theme which not only looks beatiful, but also fits to the "super"-theme of the game. What I mean is that these themes are not chosen randomly which they appear to be at first. Especially the conflict between the theme of the enviroment and the theme of the puzzle elements. This was something which I didnt like about the game at first, but after you get used to and understand that it makes sense this way I appreciated it.\nThis game is not only fun to play, fun to listen to and fun to explore but its also simply fun to look at, its gorgeous.\n\nSoundtrackVery beatiful and fitting soundtrack. There is one track for every "land" and the tracks feel like they have been chosen very carefully. You will hear them a lot but they never get annoying, they actually make the puzzles even more fun because you can listen to great music while thinking about the solution to a puzzle or arguing about philosophical questions. Really impressive.\n\nGraphicsThe graphics of this game are also really impressive. There are no loading screens, only when you start the game, you have EXTREMELY huge view distance, performance is extremely good on maximum settings, though my PC might be overkill. Almost every texture is tesselated which looks so good and there is some extremely impressive scenery, like really impressive where you will just say "Wow.".\nThe only gripe I have are the animations of the character you are controlling, they are a little bit stiff but when you play in first person mode (which I recommend) then you wont notice this anyway.","February 6, 2015","true","20.6"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

Almost better than Portal, but Elohim can't beat GLaDOS. Croteam made an excellent work with this game, and showed, that we don't need guns to make a good logic-puzzle game. But the best thing, which I repsect them for, is the pricing. Since they live in Croatia, they KNOW how low is our salary, so they set the pricing according to it. 20 EUR for an amazing game is not that much in my opinion, and the DLC-s aren't things either, which were cut off on purpose. They made a game, no they made a COMPLETE game, and that's why I respect them. I will probably purchase Prototype DLC, because I love their skill in making puzzles. As for the game: It's made with Serious Engine 4, so the visuals are pretty good, but it has some performance issues starting from Area C. The puzzles are really well made, and they found the golden path, where you aren't frustrated if you fail at a puzzle, but you keep pushing yourself to solve it. A little negative: The computer logs were slowing down the flow of events a bit. I mean I wanted to solve the next puzzle, but had to read those logs. And the story wasn't that good either. It was good to connect the puzzles, but it wasn't THAT good. Anyway if you'll have the chance BUY THIS GAME you won't regret it. If you liked Portal and Quantum Conundrum, you should play this game too!\n\n+Amazing graphics\n+Well made puzzles\n+Good Story...\n\n-...which isn't really that good\n-minor performance drops\n\nOverall 9/10.

It is a damingly frustrating thing, a commensurately challenging one, and, if seen to its proper end, an almost incomparably beautiful experience. In an era in which interactive entertainment has relied on cut scenes, automated gameplay, stray design elements that betray interior logic, and obtuse ludonarrative artifice, we should feel an obligation to lionize an effort as ruthlessly attentive as this one, in which all these many pratfalls of interactive storytelling are considered cardinal sins, and though many of them exist here in a form, they are deployed with a high degree of mindfulness. This is a game that respects you--not just you as you've become, but you-as-you-were, the very primal, curious little thing you were as you began life, learning how to live. It demands your investment. It demands your patience. It demands your faith, your doubt, and everything that goes into making you you.\n\nThe less said in this public format about the nature of the game's effect and experience the better. There's room here to discuss the intracies of its design philosphy and the painstaking organization of its elements in many essays. I'll just say, that as it reads "Abandon all hope ye, who enter here" above many a door to a lead game designer's insecure vision of tomorrow, to many a dystopic vista of cloying outrage and cynical pandering, The Talos Principle instead chooses the hard way, which is to keep a little cinder of hope alive in its hand and invite you to give it a little puff of your own breath. Play Portal if you want cute, quotable glibbery. Play The Talos Principle if you've been inside your head too long and want something to tear open a hot, hungry hole in your heart.","April 21","true","21.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","0"

This game has just about everything going for it. A puzzler that has its priorities set right.\n\nPROS:\n* Don't have to be a puzzle-wiz to complete the game.\n* A huge range of optional, difficult puzzles for those who enjoy puzzling.\n* Well balanced, quality puzzles. Easy solutions aren't stupid, hard solutions don't require MLG skills. Every puzzle is carefully tested to prevent cheap solutions.\n* Rewards players who enjoy breaking games instead of obeying the rules. Easy recovery from broken/stuck states, no penalty deaths, and you get stars too!\n* Story is easy to follow and minimal engagement is required, yet still will leave you thinking for days and provides pages of extra content for those who are interested.\n* A candy store for completionists.\n* Beautiful lighting, textures, music, sounds, and voice acting.\n* Accomodates every type of gamer, even those who usually avoid FPS-style games.\n* Every customization option you ever wanted as a PC master race gamer.\n\nCONS:\n* Models and animations look 10 years old.\n* Music and sound effects can get repetetive and irritating by the 20 hour mark.\n* A few puzzles and mechanics will probably force you to consult at least a hint guide or a friend (hint: you can put boxes on top of drones).\n* Will make you question your intelligence, your eyes, your sanity, and your existence.\n* So few cons I'm nitpicking.\n\nThe Talos Principle skirted on the outside of my rader for an embarrassingly long time. At first I thought it was a community mod (no idea where I got that idea) of Serious Sam 3, and had no interest in playing it. Later I dismissed it out because SS3 surely a puzzle game made by the same creators would feature every frustrating timing/precision based puzzle tactic I hate?\n\nHow I regret my assumptions! The Talos Principle is a puzzler that knows what it's doing. No other game has ranked alongside Portal for quality before The Talons Principle. Not even Portal 2 got the key to puzzling correct - the best puzzle games challenge your assumptions and make you constantly question what you really have, and what you can really do.\n\nThe Talos Principle does it right, and throws in stunningly beautiful landscapes, sounds, and a story that is both deeply engaging and yet incredibly minimalistic. Add dozens of hours of extra content for the completionists, from extra story content to extra puzzles, to a rewind mechanic and stars that encourage you to break the game in every way possible, and you have a game that is well worth the price and then some.","July 25, 2015","true","52.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","1"

I'll elaborate...\n\nThis game is an excellent first-person style puzzle game, done in the style of Portal (no, it's not portal, and it doesn't try to be, so don't say it's a clone).\n\nYou awaken in a strange garden and hear the voice of one might presume was God telling you what you're doing and what to do. You're immediately thrust into an environment that looks like it came straight ouf of Riven and was mixed with a Pure Moods cd.\n\nThe beginning of the game is just learning how to move around and interact with objects, which will ultimately be used to collect Tetris-like pieces called sigils. Sigils play a big part in the game as you play on, where the object is to solve puzzles to unlock further areas to explore. Thrown throughout the game are random tidbits of information stored on computer terminals, complete with a somewhat intelligent computer program that will attempt to test your understanding of the physical world. Also strewn about are lots of QR codes with random blatherings and sparsely helpful information.\n\nAs you progress through the game (which can easily span 15+ hours) you will encounter puzzles that don't get terribly challenging, but just enough to test your wit, each getting harder as you go. There's even optional extra puzzles, if you know where to look. As you play on, you will unlock tools that make completing the puzzles a lot more fun. The best part is, there's no one way to solve them (ok some of them there might be, but not always). You can do whatever it takes to bend the rules to meet your goal. There's three different endings each with a message and a cutscene to explain why you are where you are and what's to become of you. Telling any more would just ruin the experience.\n\nThe last thing to mention, (also the first), is the music and visuals. This game has some of the best representations of serene landscape I've seen in a while. Coupled with a soundtrack that is on par with Enigma, you'll definitely not regret just firing this up and letting it sit there while you relax.\n\nI had a great time with this game, and even after it's over, it's not over. There's lots of user modded content that will keep you testing your skills against the toughest challenges.

In short, you solve puzzles by connecting lasers and push plates on your way to sigils, but that's only on the face of it. There's a deeper puzzle within, one that makes you question your own beliefs. Who is this voice in the sky? Should I trust him? Who's this person in the computer? Should I trust him? He certainly seems to have an answer against everything I believe in. Should I continue believing in the things I do?\n\nIt certainly is a unique experience that touches you on an intellectual level that is so rarely seen in gaming. The puzzles, while pretty easy in the first third to half of the game, grow increasingly more difficult, especially if you seek out all the star sigils as well. This game kind of came out of left field and I didn't even hear about it until it was already released. I bought it on a whim after enjoying the demo and am not disappointed at all. This is game of the year quality and I worry that it will slip through the cracks and become a hidden gem.

The comparison between the two is common, and I still have a certain favoritism toward Portal's core mechanics (the portals, which just feel cooler to play with than many of the mechanics in The Talos Principle), but the fact is that the two games have wildly different atmospheres. I still love Portal for its wonderful characters, voices, and its general feel, but The Talos Principle is thought-provoking, somber, and genuinely brought me to the brink of tears.\n\nPortal's main conflict revolves around the player and GLaDOS -- a very concrete adversary. The conflict is still resolved as a direct confrontation.\n\nThe Talos Principle's main conflict exists within the player's own mind, and while characters may attempt to sway the player's opinion, the player is given full control over their progression and the outcome.\n\nFrom a world design point of view, The Talos Principle feels wonderfully open. The player can choose to go anywhere they wish, but it's clearly defined when something impedes your progress.\n\nTo summarize, Portal still wins in my heart for humor, presentation of its characters, and some in-game mechanics. The Talos Principle has atmosphere, world design, and far more food for thought, which makes it far more up my alley. Even if most of my friends don't really enjoy puzzle games, I'll be recommending this to everyone I know.","December 26, 2014","true","39.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You don't know who you are or what's going on. A booming voice from the sky says it loves you and wants you to have faith, but also it has some tests in store for you. You feel like Adam & Eve in the Garden of Eden, except you're alone.\n\nTTP is about personhood, consciousness, AI, the Turing test, and related ideas. And I really mean it addresses those topics. A lot of games that try to incorporate philosophy fail at it; often it boils down to superficial mentions of standard ideas, maybe they name a character Nietzsche or some ♥♥♥♥, and you're supposed to go, "whoa".\n\nNot this game. TTP draws from incredibly varied sources and truly approaches its questions from all sides. For instance, in the game we hear about men made of metal from Greek myth, conceptual precursors to Turing's thinking machines and our android, in a sense. We learn about how ancient Egyptians believed the soul to be composed of five elements (heart, shadow, name, personality, spark) and are treated to a breathtaking parallel between each of these elements and what it takes to be a person (I won't spoil it). This kind of fullness of exploration --- what can we put into a machine to make it a person? what do we need to take away from a person to make them no longer a person? --- characterizes the whole game.\n\nAn important character in TTP is someone you only chat with through a computer terminal. They question you on your beliefs regarding the nature of consciousness and personhood and encourage you to rebel against the voice in the sky --- a Turing test with the Serpent, as it were. What I found amazing was that you can choose how you answer the questions, and the game CALLS OUT inconsistencies in your responses!\n\nThe actual gameplay consists of solving Portal-style puzzles (there are no portals though). They're very well designed and a lot of fun. To get through them you employ geometric, combinatorial, physical, and even temporal reasoning (there's a mechanic reminiscent of Braid). What's more, the puzzles tie in with the overarching theme --- one can easily imagine puzzles like these being the very basis of an intelligence test!\n\nOnce you realize this, you start paying attention to your own thought processes as you solve them, wondering, "what exact thoughts make me intelligent?" I've been playing puzzle games for years and I'd never done this; it is mind-blowing. You actually realize that a lot of the time you're not being intelligent at all, but running an algorithm you can even put into words: "where do I need to go? What's blocking my path? What do I need to unblock the path? Let's look for that thing." There are plenty of moments where you need to get creative, but given all the ideas in the game, you can't help but wonder: maybe creativity is just when you can't put your algorithm into words?\n\nFinally, on top of being extremely thought-provoking, the story is moving, and truly epic --- in the original sense of "epic". I had a lump in my throat at the end.\n\nAn amazing game on all levels, I give it 11/10. This is one of the games to rub in the face of anyone who claims games aren't art. The visuals are gorgeous to boot, it had been a while since I'd audibly gasped at graphics in a videogame.","November 11, 2015","true","31.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Most games of this type fail to build mechanics around line-of-sight puzzles which are at their best in first-person. Talos uses line-of-sight in almost every puzzle for disabling beams, connecting lasers, and sentry traps. The other puzzle elements overlap nicely with the base ones to create clear rules for the possible combinations.\n\nThe "single player co-op" mechanic is frustrating (as it usually is in games) because it forces you to go as slow as possible in the first run through or risk repeating the recording again. And then something fiddly or unforeseen almost always forces you to do a boring rerecording. This make experimentation very slow and painful, so more complex puzzles feel crushingly difficult and a chore to think through.\n\nThe story is brilliantly done! I poses basic existential philosophy in a very conversational tone and never forces an agenda except that contradictions lie down almost any way of thinking. The idealized and glitchy world is beautiful and fits perfectly with the narrative. Some side stories are too confusing to follow, but serve to make the history feel more complete. Great music.\n\nAt a certain point it feels like the puzzles don’t get any harder, while some of the hidden gold stars are way too easy and some are way too hard. But in all cases, I enjoyed solving the puzzles. Breaking components out of a puzzle to use in other secret puzzles was amazing fun, though sometimes felt buggy. There’s also a lot of Easter eggs which are a great rewards for poking around the edges.\n\nOverall it’s a great puzzle game which a very original story. Worth playing if you like puzzles.\n\nUPDATE FOR DLC:\n\nThe DLC adds another set of puzzles that mix up the existing elements in new ways. Some of these are my new favorites and it's clear that the devs have gotten even better at crafting good puzzles. The story expands on the original in some new directions and is also some of my favorite writing in the game. If you enjoyed the base game this expansion is a must.","April 11, 2015","true","28.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

A beautiful "MUST HAVE" game for puzzle gamers!\n\nCroteam, the creators of Serious Sam videogame series, decided to take a step back from violence and gore, for once, and decided to make a game that everyone could enjoy. And they've created this masterpiece.\n\nThe Story!SPOILER ALERT!\nI would like to say to you that you should go in this game blind, but it's your call.\nThe Talos Principle takes place at the Virtual World. You woke up in the ruined sector called Ancient Rome. ELOHIM speaks to you in your journey, guiding you through this land. As you start exploring that world, you will complete the Puzzles. At the every end of every puzzle, you will collet an object called "Sigil". Collecting them advances you to further levels. ELOHIM will grant you an Entirnity if you manage to collect them all! You will also meet "Milton Library Asssistant"(MLA), The Blessed Messengers in your journey and much more, but you will also face the Tower that ELOHIM forbbids you to climb it. How are you going to use your will that ELOHIM gave you? Will you accept the Entirnity, or use it to climb the Forbbiden Tower? It's up to you, my dear player!\n\nProsThe Story - Talos Principle has sort of complex, yet resonable story that you should mostly pay attention to while playing that game. Trust me. It gets better and better when you do.\n\nSoundtrack - The game offers the non-distracting, but calm background music to listen to. If you're willing to get the Soundtrack, go to DLC section of that game.\n\nUnique Puzzles - At the beginning, you will be met with simple obstacles that you're gonna pass through and objects that you're gonna use during the game. As you collect the Sigils, you will unlock the various items and newer levels, making the puzzles more complex to solve. You will see yourself which puzzle is easy and which one is difficult once you start the journey.\n\nSigil Stars - Talos Principle will have hidden Sigils that you might want to collect. It requires a bit of intelligence to get some, but, at the end, the third ending might be worth it.\nConsRepetitive - Once you're done with the first ending, you'll have to start over a new game in order to find a new ending. Problem is that you'll know how to solve most of puzzles when you play it again, making it a bit boring AKA - The Entirnity.\n\nELOHIM - A part of the repetitive topic. He can get you on your nerves when you're playing this game. Especially when you repeat the game... Don't worry, if you want some comedy in this game, then try out the Serious DLC and switch ELOHIM with someone with Serious sense. And you already know who am I talking to.\nThe best puzzle game that you can find on Steam! Would recommend to everyone. And by that I, mean... EVERYONE!!! Literally!\n\nAnd if you really like it, then go ahead and try out the "Road to Gehenna DLC"!","March 22","true","28.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

This is a game that's best when approached with patience. Some of the harder puzzles will force you to stop and think, naturally, but you get the most out of the game when you read all the texts and QR codes you encounter and ponder a bit about them. While not really new questions (actually people have been asking them since the beginning of history), they aren't ones you encounter often in daily life. For me to actually think some more about them: that's the game's greatest achievement in my opinion.\n\nHowever, other more tradional game-elements are also done extremely well. As mentioned, the puzzles are great and their difficulty slope is pretty good. The graphics are really pretty and some of the landscapes and lighting effects are beautiful to behold. A final mention should go to Damjan Mravunac's soothing soundtrack, I especially dug the melancholy tunes of the starting world.

Each "level" has various areas with logic puzzles where you have to manipulate lasers, open doors, beware of turrets with red lasers, the works. What makes this game like Myst as well is there always seems to be a puzzle to solve outside of the independent areas, whether it be redirecting a laser from one puzzle to another, or leaving one puzzle in a particular state so that you can access some part of it from another location.\n\nIf you enjoy puzzles for the pure sake of doing puzzles, with no rhyme or reason, no matter the difficulty, then you'll love this game. But if you're anything like me, these puzzles will become slightly tedious, and you'll care more about the lore and getting to the end than solving every puzzle that the game puts in front of you (because, for the most satisfying endings, you need to solve just about every single one). Luckily, there's plenty of solutions and walkthroughs online if you can't will yourself to finish alone.\n\nStory/LoreThis is what makes this game phenomenal. The story and lore in this game is Witcher 3-level deep. I'm talking tons of audio logs, hundreds of text logs, QR codes on the walls, and a fantastic narrative to follow it. This game would be great as a visual novel, that alone should say something about how great this story is. It makes you question your place in the world and you fall in love with characters you don't even meet.\n\nMusicThe music is nothing to rave about, but the tracks are very nice, giving a creepy ambiance to the game. The tracks also change based on the themes of the areas, which is nice.\n\nJumpscares?While this game has a sort of horror ambiance, there's no real intentional jumpscares. The death animation is a bit jarring and  there's one scene after the last puzzle in B1 that involves 'screaming', it's a bit jumpscare-y .\n\nOverall, this game is fantastic. The environment, lore, and ambiance is fantastic alone, but paired with a difficult puzzler, it's a must buy.","May 22","true","17.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

A lot of variety and many "aha!" moments to be had. A few of the puzzles are more busy work than actual brain-teasers but these are few and far in between. For those who have played Portal and are expecting something similar, be warned that this game ranges from pathetically easy to crushingly difficult (much more so than either of the Portal games) in its puzzles, of which there are well over 100. The game's replay value lies mainly in its multiple endings. An absolute must have if you love or even kind of like puzzle games. Even those who are indifferent to puzzle games should try it.\n\nFor those who are prone to depression, think twice about playing this game. It's more than capable of striking the fear of god into your heart with existential dread thanks to its philosophical storyline, which can make you wonder about the value of your own life and the lives of those around you.\n\nA $40 price tag may seem heavy for a puzzle game but it's well worth every penny.

If you liked Portal's puzzles, you will like the Talos Principle's which are similar in that your avenues for problem solving are largely determined by the tools in the environment.  You'll start out needing only an electronics jammer to disable hologram gate thingies, turrets, and floating death spheres but puzzles will soon get more complex and introduce new elements such as redirectable lasers.  Overall, I found the puzzles very fun and challenging.\n\nOther than the style of puzzles and some superficial similarities, The Talos Principle does things quite differently from Portal.  For one thing, the puzzles are not layed out linearly.  Each puzzle will give you a tetronimo and certain combinations of tetronimos can unlock new puzzle areas or puzzle-solving gadgets.  So some puzzles have interchangable prerequisites, but if you ever get stuck on one there are plenty of others you can work on instead.\n\nWhat I think really makes this game special is the narrative, which also gives you some choice in how it plays out.  Your primary interaction with the narrative is in the dialogue you'll have with a program that communicates through computer terminals throughout the game.  The dialogue is philisophical in nature, focusing a lot on personhood, and though I occasionally felt none of the dialogue options let me say what I wanted to, this happened surprisingly rarely considering the depth of the conversation topics.  I generally felt like I was having a real conversation.\n\nThere is a lot more to like about the narrative such as its allegorical elements and tight use of literary works, but basically if you like portal-esque puzzles or pondering ideas, you should give this game a shot.","January 5, 2015","true","35.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Just about everything in the game is wonderful but it's the amount of polish on the puzzle mechanics that really impresses me. Play the demo and see what I mean: objects show you exactly where they'll be when you put them down, things snap to places that you need to place them precicely, and whenever there's a place that you're actually supposed to jump the game will show you that you're able to and just let you press spacebar to do it without requiring your precision. Most of all I like how when you are placing the laser connectors, which need line of sight to everything they connect with, the game will shift where you are able to put them down to try to make sure that your planned lines of sight work when you place it, and will tell you when they don't. Almost never in the game did I feel like the game was preventing me from solving a puzzle I knew how to solve; if you've figured out what you need to do then solving the puzzle will go very smoothly.\n\nThe puzzles are very well made and very well paced. The game has a very loosely ordered selection of puzzles such that you can easily skip any that you get stuck on and come back later when you're more skilled at the game. The puzzles which you need to beat to progress to new areas are straightforward practice for the game mechanics. You don't unlock new mechanics unless you can solve the more involved puzzles with the old ones. The fully difficult puzzles aren't needed for anything except the ending, so the game makes sure that by the time you're actually forced to solve a puzzle to progress that you'll have had plenty of opportunities to work your way up to them. Alternatively you can just solve them all the order they're presented for a nice challenge throughout the game. Also present are the stars, which are their own puzzles which you thankfully never need to touch to get the most rewarding conclusion to the game. But they're always present, just out of reach, requiring you to do things that are very clearly cheating (How do I even get a blue laser? There isn't one anywhere in this puzzle!). If you're into following clues to secret passages and discovering "exploits" in the game, they're a lot of fun. Still, every puzzle, even (especially) the stars, is extremely rewarding to complete and makes you feel good about yourself for figuring them out. There's also easter eggs of some sort or another hidden in basically every level, almost all of which I missed until the late game.\n\nAside from the joy of solving the puzzles themselves, the game also rewards you by slowly drip-feeding you story as you enter new levels and complete their challenges. The whole thing manages to sit comfortably on the edge where it feels enigmatic and philosophical without becoming awkward or overly pretentious. You find yourself searching around looking for more (thankfully either noisy or contrasting-colored) things to read. I recommend this game more than anything else I've played in recent memory. Assuming of course you're into this sort of game. Play the demo! It does a really good job of showing off the game and I would have never considered buying this at all had the demo not made such a good impression on me. There's a whole lot of content in it and it's definitely worth the steep price asked.","December 17, 2014","true","64.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

One: It immediately compares your game to Portal, which has an amazing gameplay framework and some of the best writing I've seen in a video game. Two: It implies that Portal is unbeatable in the genre, which makes me think 'Oh, the best game since Portal? Why don't I just play Portal then, since we've all agreed that Valve has set a benchmark we all can never beat? Gather copies of Antichamber and Quantum Conundrum, throw them on the bonfire! We've reached the pinnacle of the genre, there's no point now!'\n\nAnyway, The Talos Principle is the best puzzler I've ever played since Portal. This is because the game itself has a great framework for puzzles and manages to remain consistently good for two-thirds of its playtime (25-30 hours). Not only that, it's got decent storytelling qualities. Not as good as Portal's, but still, I can't fault a game that actually has you engage in existential debates with an artificial intelligence. (You won't be asked to brush up on your Immanuel Kant, but if you are familiar with his work you'll get more out of the game!)\n\nThe puzzles are fantastic - they are small but they get difficult. But not too difficult. Just enough to provide that 'ah-ha' moment when the solution comes together. There's only six props to solve puzzles with and you have to earn them first. But when you do, they're like getting new toys - barely learning how to use them at first, but the further and further you get, the more efficient you'll get, and in turn the game gets harder, and you use the secret tricks you've learned with these toys to beat the harder puzzles, leading to another set of delicious 'ah-ha' moments and smug satisfaction. Eat it, computer game. The student has now become the master of putting things on boxes! Oh crap, how do I beat this puzzle?\n\nExploring the world is a treat to be done between puzzles. You can take in the lush scenery of rotting architecture and poking computer terminals to read the scraps of data left behind in the simulation. Sometimes when you poke one of the terminals a filthy computer smartass with a liberal arts degree pops up and questions you about whether you're really human. I told it "I am human, because I think, so go to hell!" and it told me "Yeah, but PHILOSOPHY KARATE CHOP, HAHA! Not so smart now, are you?" and I have to end up conceding because the meager amount of Kierkegaard I read from a comic book was about as useful as a rock in the middle of an artillery strike. I make this sound like a dry pseudo-intellectual slapfight, but it's all just theatrics for the storytelling itself, and you can finish the game whether you win the 'debates' or not. Throw yourself as hard as you can into it, it's fun!\n\nSpeaking of finishing video games: There are so many puzzles that this game is The Puzzle Warehouse. The puzzles themselves are wonderfully constructed, but there are so many of them that even the 'ah-ha' moments started to wear off and I literally groaned at the thought of there being more puzzles. It's like reading a good but wordy novel - a lot of fun but finishing the damn thing requires a bit of dedication. Like an Umberto Eco novel, for example.\n\nAnyway BEST DAMN FIRST PERSON PUZZLER SINCE PORTAL BUY IT.

The Talos Principle offers diverse, clever puzzles that properly challenge the player, without ever being either too punishing or too obvious. The game has beautiful graphics and an atmosphere that really sets the overall tone, and delivers a minimalistic story that seamlessly meshes biblical mythology with eschatological science fiction (mostly in a non-intrusive, player-driven way). I actually (and not just rhetorically) found myself wondering at some of the philosophical questions the writers threw at me, pausing at times to read over a text or listen to an audio for the second time, alternately challenging *POSSIBLE SPOILERS* the voice in the sky and the uncanny word-processor in the terminals *END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS*. As I advanced through the game, it really felt like progress – learning new mechanics, new questions, new theories as to what the answers might be; not to mention the knowledge of past (fictional) players who came before, and how to build upon their insights. In a nutshell, this is a very mature game, bold and confident, and deservingly so. The only negative comment I can make is that it instigated my curiosity a little too much a bit too early, and I found myself rushing through the last two chambers in a state of frenzy – just so that I could fully understand the story and how everything fit together.

You'll be exploring gorgeous environments as you solve puzzle to puzzle, so you can collect pieces to complete other puzzles! While you tickle your brain, the game slowly unfolds a loose narrative that explores themes of the self, and the existential. Philosophy majors, this game is practically made for you!\n\nThough it all could sound slightly pretentious,  the creatively designed puzzles that seems to hit just the right mark in difficulty and satisfaction, that I think even the most modest of puzzle players (like myself) can find a lot of enjoyment from The Talos Principle. If you're not into heavy philosophical themes, the good news is the gameplay is more than enough as the focal point.\n\nThe Talos principle also features some of the best graphics I've seen this year in games. Not only are the texture, model, and lighting quality expertly crafted, but the design, the idea of mixing multiple timeline motifs, is equally worth praising. Those who enjoy a great sound track from their games won't be disappointed here either.\n\nTo be honest, I have a hard time coming up with a negative for this game. I am really enjoying it so far, and I find most every aspect of it very satisfying. I think the only thing that might be keeping some potential players away is the price point. $40 is defiantly a higher end price point for what a lot consider and indie game. I don't agree with the notion that indie games need to be set at a lower price point, but I am also aware it does exists. What I will say is that the game has a presentation quality that in my opinion, is on the same level as many AAA games, while retaining that creative freedom that indie games have come to be known for.\n\nPros:\n- Creative and satisfying puzzles\n- Gorgeous art and design\n- Great OST\n- Intrigueing narrative\n\nCons:\n- Might be pricey for some","December 20, 2014","true","11.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I am very impressed. It has been likened to Portal, and that's certainly a fitting analogy. It does remind you of Portal, but without the excessively sinister overtone. You're not feeling like a trapped lab rat so much, as more an evolving entity, accepting guidance, but also surpassing the guide (who identifies himself as 'Elohim' which is a Hebrew word for 'god') by trying to make up its own mind.\n\n'Elohim' feels like a metaphor here, for some kind of an inner conflict between curiosity and caution which is a balance that seems to be  a constant companion throughout this game, and, as it happens, throughout one's own life.\n\n'The Talos Principle' appears as if Portal, Tron and the Stanley Parable had a brainchild with an iRobot like intelligence, while taking place in beautiful environments with serene music. I find this game very stimulating and calming at the same time. Definitely a superb idea, well executed.\n\nGame performance can be very well adapted to match your system's capability, you can switch between a third person (over the shoulder) and first person view; I prefer the third person mostly.\n\nIf you, at least occasionally, enjoy a game that challenges your intellect (instead of your trigger finger), while providing an almost meditative atmosphere, this is definitely the game you want to get!

It's hard to find a game that is great in all aspects, but Croteam really hit the nail on the head with this one. If the graphics weren't convincing enough, the puzzles are amazing and beautifully crafted so that there are many ways to solve them. There's even starts to collect which involve seeing how the puzzles interact with each other to provide a great result. The story and lore is insanely deep and thought provoking, so if you are one who does not enjoy reading, thinking, or even storyline games in general this is not for you. One of the things i loved was that the game kept you thinking even without the puzzles. The philosophical aspect is breathtaking, questioning existence in general and making you think whether or not you are actually alive, yet alone exist. The game draws heavily on the creation story in the Bible, but the way it is executed is outstanding. Even the audio logs had deep meaning and thoughts that were inspiring at times and made you appreciate the world and what  we have. Everything this game does is amazing, from the great puzzles, to the excellent story, even to the humorous and well-placed easter eggs. The only games this could be compared to are Portal and Portal 2, but Talos is lightyears ahead in terms of complexity. I feel the need to stress the quality of the graphics again. They are just beyond beautiful and completely breathtaking (Egypt is the most beautiful out of all the worlds IMO). The DLC is also excellent and takes the puzzles from the main game to the next level by upping both the size and scale. I highly suggest getting this game if you are somoene who likes to think and enjoys learning new things. This is not the game for people who like FPS's or any game that doesn't involve a storyline and/or deep thought. The ending to this game is also the best out of any game I've ever played (which is saying a lot because Portal 2's ending was excellent). All around this is a great game an it's hard to find cons with it! You will enter and leave this game a completely different person than you were before.

The gameplay involves moving around various objects, redirecting lasers, and using other tools to get the objective. The gameplay is basically what you would expect from a first person puzzle game; if that’s all you’re looking for then pick it up during a sale or something. However, if you express even the slightest interest in philosophy or just complex stories in general, this game will not disappoint.

Within these puzzles you manipulate red and blue beams to unlock force fields, using boxes, fans, mobile connectors, jammers, and even a recorded version of yourself, with the goal being to reach the sigil (tetris piece) in each puzzle.  In your way are, exploding sentries, fans, anti-beam sentries, turrets, activation pads, and conveniently placed walls. The puzzles range from easy (green) to medium (yellow) to hard (red). The story is told through computer consoles located in a central area in each puzzle world, and audio file pick-ups scattered throughout the entire game. It is not necessary to access them though, as they do not block access to any part of the game.

What started off as an incredibly interesting, and entertaining experience turned sour about half-way through, when the puzzles suddenly stopped being fun and innovative, and started being the same-old same-old force-fed to you in a slightly rearranged fashion.\n\nThe computer terminal started out interesting, and I always looked forward to talking with it, but as the conversations went on, it twisted my words more and more, to the point where the end results were unrecognisable as a proper conversation. I don't know if that was the original intention or not, but speaking with it became more of a chore than anything, knowing that you were only going to be interrogated at length about something you'd never even said.\n\nThe only thing I still enjoyed by the end of the game was the fact that I could still stop and say "wow" at the stunning visuals, when I was presented a new location. Everything else had long overstayed its welcome.\n\nLike many others, I was drawn by the hype, and the promise that this game was the next Portal, that it was going to blow my mind with the story, and the amazing puzzle elements. Quite frankly, I was underwhelmed, and part of that may have been the excess of hype, building my expectations to an unrealistic degree, but I feel like I would still have left this experience more frustrated than satisfied, especially if I'd paid the full $40 asking price.\n\nIf you want a better review that pretty much sums up everything I thought, this was probably the best review I've seen so far.\n\nI also want to point out how hilarious it is to me that people still use "go back to CoD" as an insult, seeing as how blindly defending a flawed game just because it holds the title it does is exactly what CoD players are stereotyped for.","December 5, 2015","false","23.9"," 73 of 137 people (53%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","53","73","137","9","5"

They never got frustrating, and I was never contempt to look up the solution on the Internet, and that is not to say, that I never had hard time with them, but it was very satisfying to figure them out on my own. For people who want even more challenge, there are additional puzzles, which are not required to complete the game.\nFor me, the strongest part of this game was its story and setting. While Portal 2 goes for the humoristic look on the artificial intelligence, this game takes a very serious look on these matters, and without a doubt succeeds in doing so.  The narrative revealed through many text and audio logs is very compelling, and can get very philosophical at times, but that is what I liked about this game. The game likes to ask some hard questions, and in quite few cases I was doubting if the answer I gave, was the right one.\nI was always in a hurry to finish my puzzles, just so I could get a new piece of information about the world and its history. The closer I got to the ending, the more I found myself wanting to find out what lies at the end of this game.\nAnother strong part of this game was its sound and music that always was very fitting and calming. All the audio logs were beautiful and very well acted.\nWhen I started the game, I never expected that i would get so immersed in it. I enjoyed it all the way through, and I recommend it to anyone who have any interest in puzzle games. You will definitely enjoy this game, if you played and liked either one of the following games: Portal 2, The Swapper and Braid.\nThe Talos Principle would be my game of the year, if not for Dark Souls 2.\n","January 1, 2015","true","16.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Let me explain.\n\nThe puzzles are, puzzling. And indeed, hard and frustrating at times. But the sense of accomplishment when you reach your goal is very satisfying. Thats the best feeling you get.\n\nBut forget about the puzzles for a minute. The story of this game is incredible. I would call it a mix of psychological and philosofical.

I hate puzzlers. I absolutely loathe them, even, yet I found myself drawn in, and simply could not resist. So, excellent job on making a game that managed to draw me in to a genre I avoid the best I can.\n\nThe graphics and music are perfect. Enough to make things great, but not enough to drown you at any point. The music especially stood out to me, it seemed that no matter what location I found myself in, the music fit the ambience and climate of the current world. The graphics were quite gorgeous, but the game handled just as well on my gaming desktop as it did on my three and a half year old laptop. Overall, I found this to be a rich experience, and gotta say, you did not dissapoint in the slightest.\n\nThe story, however loose it was, was also great. It gave a nice grand appearance of some sort of mystery, and how much the entire game was steeped in philosophy... It definitely added to the experience. I especially loved the interactions between MLA and Elohim. Both tried to get you to do what they wanted, in a sense, and anytime Elohim spoke, I stopped and listened. Everytime I came to a terminal with a new conversation with MLA, I looked forward to it. The audio logs, I think, were the best narrative as far as all of the asides go. It was quite enjoyable playing them all back to back before ending the game. Also, piecing together the events that led to the simulation... very well done. The Tower Ending was hands down the best, even if it didn't make much sense the more one thought about it. Also, the moment the camera started to pan out... I swear, it looked like the Hoover Dam. Simply retooled, and as far as power goes, it makes sense. The other two endings were good, but without the same feel the Tower ending had.\n\nThe puzzles... God, I came to hate seeing anything using the Playback item. I'd have to say that some of the hardest puzzles involved it. Also, the red herrings in a few puzzles were enough to make me realize the answer, and then facepalm quite hard when I realized the solution. I think the longest time I spent on any single puzzle was around twenty minutes, most seemed to take between 5 and 10 minutes it seemed, with only a few going to 15.\n\nThe stars were also great, building off the puzzles here. Definitely took some out of the box thinking, and I'll admit that I looked up the location of one or two in my desire to finish everything. They really make you think and get creative with your approach, as well as make you explore things.\n\nEaster Eggs... so many of them, related to Croteam's previous products as well as other well known folks and products and the like. Gotta say, a lot of them are hidden even better than the stars were, and most of them were more than worth the time to find. As it was, I only found two on my first playthrough, but there are apparently many, many more out there.\n\nOverall, I have to say, thank you for the excellent game. Looking forward to my second playthrough.","December 19, 2014","true","22.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

In order to beat the game completely, you'll need to actually think, not just throw stuff together until it works (that's how I remember beating Portal, anyway — and that's not necessarily a bad thing either, just very different).\n\nLevels are beautifully designed, minimal, and very accessible — no lava floor, no trick jumps, getting the timing right to a millisecond isn't at all necessary. If you've had the miserable experience of playing the fan-made Portal: Prelude mod, you know what I'm talking about.\n\nThe writing is also solid.\n\nTo summarize, I enjoyed The Talos Principle immensely, and you probably should too.

Often in games I turn the music off after a while due to irritation, especially if I need to concentrate, but for the first time ever I have actually bought a game soundtrack off Steam.\n\n- The puzzles, which come in 2 flavours. The tetronimo puzzles of which there is an entire free download to have fun with (Sigils of Elohim), and the logic type puzzles which remind me a little of Portal. There are no actual portals of course, but there are blocks and activators and fans and jammers, etc. There are only a few puzzles that require quick reflexes. Most of them can be pondered and contemplated and then pondered and contemplated some more. A few of the puzzles are a bit obscure, particularly involving locating and liberating all the optional stars (these are only required to unlock a few extra puzzles and an extra ending). Fortunately, there is always help to be found online for these things if you need a hint or a walk-through.\n\n- The backstory. This can be largely bypassed if desired as it is given through archive type files, both text and voice, that are found during the game. There are snippets of mythology, science, literature, history and personal information such as letters and audio diaries. Some really hit me in the feels, which was a bit wrenching at times. It's not a happy backstory at all, but I think the whole thing ties together masterfully.\n\n- The world(s). The environment is very pretty. It's peaceful. It's varied. It is also sterile. It feels desolate at times. Wandering around old ruins on a beautiful day with no birdsong or animal life beyond the crickets. Alone. For hours. It again ties in neatly with the story, though, and I confess I had to take a few screenshots.\n\n- The religious allegories. Full disclosure here. I am knee-jerk hypersensitive to religious over- and under-tones. I really don't like them, but here it is all fitting. It's strictly allegorical, metaphorical and plot-driven. Also, it is a cheerful and shameless pick-and-mix of religions from Ancient Greek and Ancient Egypt mythology to Christianity, Hinduism and Buddhism. Perhaps someone with a strong affiliation to one religion would find it offensive, I have no idea. Also, if you really can't stand the voice in the clouds booming about do this, do that, my Child, get the Serious Sam Voiceover DLC. It's not anything polished or spectacular, but it is totally irreverent and in places even amusing. It's totally improvised as far as I can tell and he goes between calling the player names, to chatting about himself, to making fun of the original script. If you have a decent knowledge of different religions you may even find a few of the clever insertions amusing. I know I did. Samsara, I am looking at you, you unhelpful bit of gear.\n\n- Revert to Back-up feature. The game makes autosaves regularly, this can be used to easily reset puzzles by holding down (default button) X. Even better, the game also stores the autosaves as a library of restore points. I love this a lot.\n\n- The endings. I played through each of the main endings. There are three of them although there are some minor variations that depend on choices made throughout. Including a variation based on the finding of one significant easter egg =^.^= I found each to be satisfying and interesting in their own way. Also, the restore back-up feature means that you can even revert to a save just before the ending after the credits have rolled and play through it again a different way.\n\n- QR codes. I found maybe 2 that failed to show the message when hovering over with the cursor (irksome), but the fact that these are being used as a form of communication between artificial intelligences within the game amused me deeply. If you find paint lying around in the world you can use it to write your own messages - which persist into a replay of the game\n\nOne thing that drove me a little crazy was trying to debate philosophy with the computer. It's interesting and frustrating in equal parts, intentionally afaik. I was able to assert at one point that frogs are people too and after that the option to write that on a wall was available to me. This also amused me a great deal, considering I often refer to myself as one because of my username ;)\n\nOverall, do I recommend? Yes, definitely a good game if you like puzzlers, thinking about the meaning of life, wandering around pretty landscapes and don't mind a fairly slow-moving game.\nIt took me about 40 hours to play the game through the first time at a gruellingly, leisurely pace. As in, I wandered around leisurely, exploring at great length, but I also played straight through, twice in a row, over the space of 4-5 days at the gruelling rate of 10+ hours a day, almost uninterrupted. I was freezing (Winter here), thirsty, hungry and in pain from being parked at my desk for such long sessions, but I wanted to finish one more puzzle, one more puzzle.\n\nAs for price, maybe it's on the hefty side. Who ever wants to pay full-price for anything? I was watching this game closely during the Steam sale and managed to grab it at an excellent discount, but when the upcoming DLC is released I doubt that I will wait for a sale. I want more!\n\nThis may be my longest review ever, lol.\n\nEdited to add: I nearly forgot another awesome feature! You can choose from a range of post-processing settings. These primarily affect brightness and saturation. So you can, if you like, have a washed out apocalyptic look, bright and colourful, noir, etc. I wish a few of my other games had that option.","July 9, 2015","true","71.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","2"

Let's look at what makes this game so enjoyable:\n\nGraphics: This is the first thing you're going to notice when you start the game...so how are they? Quite honestly, they're pretty darn good. They most certainly get the job done and immerse you into the mysterious world you're exploring. Additionally, weather/lighting effects really jazz up the environment while you're solving puzzles.\n\nGameplay: You're going to be solving puzzles. Lots of them. If you're a fan of this particular genre, you'll love it. There are a ton of elements that come into play slowly and gradually. Lasers, boxes, keys, jammers, fans, time manipulation...the list goes on and on. You won't be dealing with all of these elements right off the bat, however. The game does a wonderful job pacing itself and introducing you to each element thoroughly before moving on. It doesn't hold your hand though...you need to figure things out on your own ;) Exploration is important as well, if you wish to uncover the story or find all of the side content available (there's a ton of it).\n\nContent: The amount of content in this game is enormous. you essentially have 4 buildings packed with puzzles. At first, you'll only have access to the first. As you complete puzzles, you obtain these things called 'sigils' (basically tetris pieces). You use these to unlock new areas. Once you collect a set of 'sigils', you put the pieces in a lock, and solve this little rectangular puzzle by arranging the pieces so they fit together. These 'sigil locks' unlock everything from new buildings to more puzzle elements, and are your key to getting around. You can also collect stars, which are typically harder to obtain than sigils, to unlock some extra, harder puzzles. There are other secrets to be found too; keep your eyes open!\n\nStory: The story is very interesting and told in a unique way. It's very philosophical in nature, and will leave you thinking as much as the puzzles themselves do. The game tells this story through a few different ways; first, ELOHIM, basically god, a talking voice in the sky. Next, computer terminals. You talk to an AI and try to uncover documents and emails that reveal more to the world. Finally, there are voice recordings scattered around as well. It's really fun to piece together this story, and I never felt it was tedious or boring.\n\nOverall, I can't really think of one complaint for this game. It's brilliant, and honestly surprising it came from the creators of Serious Sam. I love how mysterious the story is, and how philosophical it is. I love how tight and smooth the gameplay is; something absolutely imperitive, especially in puzzle games. I love how much content there is in this game, and how many secrets you can find while exploring the beautiful world(s). I love it all, and hopefully you do too!","December 13, 2014","true","11.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Its epicness compares well to that of many (MMO)RPG and FPS games.  But this is the first time I've seen such epicness put into a first-person (or third-person, if you wish) puzzle game.  How epic are we talking?\n\nOver 100 puzzles in various ruins.  This includes some mini-puzzles with something called sigils (which you can play for free in a separate game).\nEstimated over 30 hours of gameplay.\nChock-full of easter eggs and stars.\nThree different endings, depending on your skill and will to solve puzzles and find secrets.\nA very tall tower.  Climb it if you dare.\nOutstanding, heavenly (literally!) soundtrack.\nAmazing visuals that shouldn't weigh your computer down.\nA deep and rich backstory and philosophy.  Even the very title of the game suggests it.  WARNING: requires your reading/listening attention.  If you just want to go out there and solve the puzzles that's fine, but be sure to come back and check all those computer terminals.\nAlthough you're merely a robot figure, the ruins, music, and visuals combine to give the essence of a religious spiritual overtone.\nOther nice perks include a wide range of language compatibility, adjustment for those prone to motion sickness, and many other various options.  It's also surprisingly stable for such a loaded game.\n\nWhat few cons this game has include:\nGetting started.  The version I have alerted me about a potential video memory problem, which wasn't really a problem.\nSometimes my game doesn't resize the resolution when working in fullscreen, which means I have to tweak the options to force fullscreen.\nWhile I love the puzzles, they can perhaps be a bit too challenging for some, with too few hints given.\nWhile I love the puzzles, they often felt too 2D (even while working in 3D occasionally).  They also felt like running around a lot and shuffling objects around, which is rather exhausting.  Portal 2 didn't have that at all, which made me kinda miss that non-Euclidean twist that Portal 2 or Antichamber has.\nIn summary: 9/10.  Highly recommended for those interested in discovering things, philosophy, or simply those who love puzzle games.  I got it on sale, but I can tell that it's most definitely worth its full price.\n","November 17, 2015","true","101.7"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","1"

It sucks horribly and goes against everything that made the game enjoyable before. Luckily it's only about 2 minutes long, but those are going to feel like hours.\n\nThankfully the reason why this section is so noticable and annoying is simple: it's the only incredibly dumb thing in an otherwise stunningly smart game that makes you feel clever and thoughful in a ton of ways and has a breathtaking amount of content, The difficulty curve for the puzzles slowly evolves from gentle teaching lessons to lengthy solutions with dozens of precise steps including tons of moving interdepentant parts.\n\nThere are barely any jumping/platforming challenges (which is a very good thing) and only rare a puzzle that requires very tight timing execution. Trial and error only gets you so far, after a while you'll start reading moves ahead like in a chess game. 99% of  the regular puzzles avoid mechanics and solutions that feel like unfair ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, which is quite impressive for the scope and variety of the game. Probably because they wisely moved all that nonsense to the entirely optional star/secret puzzles, to a degree where they manage to be frustrating even after you looked up the solution. The inconsistency is a shame, since some of them are genuinely the best lateral-thinking puzzles i've ever seen in games period - 90% of them feel like you just broke the game somehow, and in about half the cases that was actually what the devs intended.\n\nThe writing - and there is lots of it, so don't be surprised to spend more than a few minutes reading - is equally smart, about smart topics that make you feel smarter just by reading the smart stuff. If you're noticing a trend here you probably already have sufficent pattern recognition to get (more than a) kick out of this game.\n\nThe DLC is a perfect continuation of the strengths of the main game - half masterfully crafted puzzles that range from the mid to late vanilla game in complexity (and also supplies 16 more equally sadistic stars), half immensely enjoyable and thoughtful text based reading/games/humor that's far above most other games and feels like an actually satisfying reward for progressing past the challenges.\n\nBasically if they had gone without any subtlety they should've titled this game  "The Eureka! Simulator".","January 12","true","33.5"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aznplucky/recommended/257510/","aznplucky","Taiyaki >{{{º>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aznplucky/","40 products in account","This is a challenging first person puzzle game set in a captivating world. There are three "worlds," each with their own beautifully rendered historic / cultural themes, along with a futuristic tower that you ascend as you progress through the game.\n\nThe puzzles ramp up smoothly in difficulty, with easy tutorial-like levels in the beginning to sometimes maddeningly complex levels near the end. If you find the standard puzzles too easy, there are additional "star" puzzles that require more outside-the-box thinking, often involving elements from multiple puzzle levels or even the environment outside the puzzle levels.\n\nAfter a while, you start to recognize common puzzle mechanics, and as a result some of the puzzle might start seeming redundant and tedious. However, the star puzzles are constantly fresh and challenging. It's almost as if the normal puzzles are merely appetizers, while the star puzzles are the main course in this game. I think you would be doing a disservice to yourself if you didn't at least attempt to solve all the star puzzles.\n\nIf you get stuck, you might be tempted to look up solutions from google-sensei, but believe me, it's a lot more satisfying if you solve it yourself. You can always leave a puzzle and come back to it later. There are also many Easter eggs in the game, some of which you might stumble across as you're banging your head against that one puzzle you can't solve. So I guess that helps ease the pain. Some puzzles have multiple solutions, so keep that in mind.\n\nAs for the story, it's not a straightforward storybook plot that's spoon fed to you. It requires a bit of inference and noticing of subtle details, like the timestamps of messages you come across. Even then, it's not a story that will appeal to everyone. It revolves around metaphysical themes that touch on predestination, purpose, creation, and humanity. If this sounds like a lot of BS to you, then you probably won't like the story. I personally found it interesting enough. But even if it's not your cup of tea, it's not necessary to enjoy the game, as the puzzles are the real meat of the game.\n\nAs someone who sometimes gets dizzy/headaches from playing first person games, I appreciate that the game includes a FoV slider. The music is atmospheric and enjoyable, but it's nothing that stands out or catches your attention. I eventually turned it off and put on a podcast in the background.\n\nThe one critique I have about the game is the "alternate" ending you get if you unlock the extra level in the tower is uninspiring and unsatisfying. I suppose there is the satisfaction of simply solving it, but even so, it would be nice to have a better reward for it. Also, while there are barcoded messages scattered across the world that your character automatically translates for you when you view them, there is one barcode message that won't translate and requires you to use a barcode app on your phone (or google) to translate. That, I feel, is an unnecessary tedium and only serves to break immersion. However, these are small gripes for an otherwise fantastic game.","June 19, 2015","true","55.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It has an engrossing sci-fi story with heavy philosophical underpinnings, challenging puzzles, stunning visuals, and a great soundtrack. It's easy to make comparisons with the Portal games if you want to get an idea of how this game plays, but besides the first person perspective puzzles (complete with cubes that you need to put on pressure plates to open doors) they are very different experiences. This game demands much more of the player with "meaning of life" questions-what does it mean to be a person? Etc. This game also really rewards exploration with all kinds of hidden rooms and easter eggs, as well as multiple endings. My only real complaint is that half way though, I began to tire of the number of puzzles I had to grind through just to advance the story. At some point, I just wanted it to be over.

I just finished playing this game, and I've been taking my sweet time with completing it. For two reasons!\n\nFirst, the puzzles are really challenging. Compared to a game like Portal or Portal 2, both of them games that I absolutely adore (and the reason I choose to compare them is because they are quite similar), The Talos Principle is the big brother. I easily remember going through the Portal games in one night, not having to struggle too much with the solutions. This game? I could sit for hours. So, I would usually do a few puzzles every night, slowly progressing through the game. It's frustrating, but very satisfying once you complete it.\n\nSecond, the gameplay in general is absolutely amazing. Everything about this game is right up my alley. Challenging puzzles, an AMAZING story, brain♥♥♥♥ery, plot twists, beautiful scenery - this game has it all. If you enjoyed playing Portal, PLEASE try this game. It's without doubt one of the best games I have ever played.\n\nSomething that should be noted if you're an achievement hunter, all achievements can't be done in one playthrough. This guide is very good, however it contains some spoilers - you have been warned! http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=355470944\n\nEnjoy the game!

The Talos Principle's puzzles aren't as fun as Portal's overall; there's more procedural stair-stepping your way through with pretty much the same sets of tools the whole way, to the point that puzzles feel like less of a test of your ingenuity than about your long-term planning and careful attention to detail. Some people will enjoy that, but I suspect more will find it makes later puzzles more of a painful slog than anything. It's especially aggrieving when you discover what looks like a really plausible and utterly out-there solution for a puzzle only to find the truth was much more mundane -- often just a pixel-hunt to find the tiny patch of dirt where one puzzle piece will conveniently interact with everything you need.\n\nYou solve puzzles with a pretty humdrum set of tools: buttons that need weighed down, posts to redirect laser beams, short-lived temporal clones of yourself, and so on. If you want to think outside the box (and grab all the pickups necessary for the "best" ending), you can solve optional puzzles to collect hidden stars throughout the game world. These often require working outside the basic puzzle mechanics, climbing map elements, and even connecting pieces positioned in one puzzle to another. The disappointing part about earning gold stars is that you have little incentive to flex your ingenuity on these puzzles unless you can solve *all* of them, or are willing to consult a guide, as one star is just as useless as 29 of them (out of 30).\n\nWhere The Talos Principle really shines is in its writing.  Being a lost robot in a Garden of puzzles commanded by the booming disembodied voice of God feels a bit silly, as does arguing basic introductory philosophy concepts with an apparently sentient computer interface. But the more you learn, the more you unravel a really excellent sci-fi story about philosophy, learning, the meaning of being human, and the continuation of purposes greater than ourselves. The story is really what makes The Talos Principle worth playing, and once you consume all the story fluff, it can be hard to want to power through the remaining puzzles to achieve better, more complete endings. When you've read research logs from a massive species-wide scientific project of absolutely cosmic ambition, when you've listened to the stories about how humans face unthinkable catastrophe, and when you've argued with a vaguely Satanic computer about the proof of your own sentience, the order in which you move puzzle pieces to slog through the end of the game gets a lot less compelling.\n\nIf you liked Portal for its story, there's plenty to love in The Talos Principle. If you liked it for its puzzles, keep looking.","January 29, 2015","true","30.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

While they are both 3D puzzle games, beyond that they are two very different types of game.  Talos Principle is less vertical than Portal.  It also doesn't poke holes in the time-space continuum with portal guns.  Instead, it allows you to overlap a copy of yourself in time, thus allowing you to access to places which you usually cannot!  The underlying themes of the two games are also very different.  Talos Principle focuses on what it means to be a human being and whether or not we could duplicate it in machines.  Whereas Portal series is about machines gaining self awareness as more tasks become automated.\n\nThe reason I'm not giving a 10/10 to this game is because some of the secrets are so hard to find, the game itself offers almost no clues on how to find them.  So you either come across them by blind luck or have to look it up in a guide.  The soundtrack is superb and fits the game very well.","December 31, 2015","true","53.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I rarely play puzzle games and even when I do, I usually don't have the patience to try and solve/search for everything. But Talos caught me really fast. The way the game teaches you stuff is amazing. You are exploring a world filled with puzzles. You solve those while using tools and get rewarded with sigils. Eventually you will unlock more tools and more worlds with those sigils. And maybe if you get enough, you will be able to understand the beautiful world you are trapped in, because all you really want is to escape, right?\n\nThe game also contains hidden stars. This is where the game is really at, where the challenge is. You just can't beat the feeling you get by discovering 'how' to get and solve some of those harder stars. They are also dozens of easter eggs everywhere and those are all about exploration of the world, getting out of boundaries, being clever, taking a leap, being innovative and you get rewarded really good sometimes.\n\nMost puzzle games have little story or not at all. But yet, Talos got me into it's story more than RPG games such as Dark Souls. You have those metaphysical conversations with a terminal. They get really deep. You end up questioning yourself about your actions, choices, who you are and what you believe, humanity in general, so much more too.\n\nThe music is quite relaxing and really amazing. It fits the theme really well and it didn't took me long to realize I might have to buy the soundtrack too.\n\nI just bought the DLC Road To Gehenna to get me some more puzzles.\nTalos also just made me buy Portal 1 and 2.\n\nGame started out as a 9 but I liked it so much it deserve at least 9.5/10.","December 28, 2015","true","36.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

It is extremely well made in all aspect.\n\nSo let's get the basics out of the way and then go from there...\n\nGraphics: So the graphics are really nice and resemble that of Serious Sam 3 (considering it's made by the same people) so do not expect super amazing graphics but they are still very good.\n\nAudio: The audio is pretty simple if you ask me, basic foot sounds, running and jumping but it has some very relaxing music added to the game, which I find serves a purpose because some puzzles make you angry and it's there to relax you I guess.\n\nControls:  The controls are surprisingly sharp and fast, very quick to get used too and only slightly hard when trying to do some leap jumps, then it takes a little practice.\n\nThe game: So the game is a puzzle game basically with a great dialogue background, tons and tons and tons of secrets built into this game with the same amount of Easter eggs to hunt for, if you enjoy searching for for those things for hours then this is the game for you, if you also enjoy puzzle solving, kinda like portal but not quiet then this is 100% your game to play.\n\nThe only down part I found was there is no multiplayer and I would love to play with friends on this game, solving stuff together, searching for stuff and even have coop puzzles to do together which would be amazing and even the option to create our own together would be amazing too.\n\nI was skeptical about getting this game and now I am extremely happy I did, love this game and would recommend for the type of person who likes a game where you have to think, search, sometimes solve and so on.","November 26, 2015","true","29.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

With over 120 varied puzzles this game delivers for its hefty price of 45 euros. A little warning though, dedication is required.  Because this game uses only a limited set of elements to create its challenges, puzzles may start to look a lot alike before you're even half way. It  actually caused me to burn out on the game at first.  There were two things that kept me playing.\n\nFirst, experimenting, exploration and trying to break the physics of the game is greatly rewarded. I have a knack for doing silly stuff in games when i'm burned out on the main and side quests. running, jumping and fooling around. Here I started to mess with the jump platforms. Could I jump over the walls of the puzzle area? Could I take stuff from the area with me? What would could I do with that? Surprisingly this  goofing  payed off. This game rewarded my  'efforts' by reaching extra sigils and easter eggs. It's great fun and adds to being really engaged in the story, because the exploration and easter eggs  give it more depth.\n\nThe story, and the way you experience it, was the next thing to keep my attention. I really like games that dare to pose questions to me as a player. Questions like for example: What makes someone human? or what is a soul? or what is  time? It makes the game 'stick' for me, because  thinking about it really really engages me more in the protagonist of the game. Here this works perfectly. You awake as the 'program/soul' of a clueless robot trying to find its way and purpose.  Robots are build for a task, right? But what is that task in this world without humans? What happened here anyway?\nThe experience of the game adds to the story. The tale of finding your purpose is one of many choices you have to make in 'life' and the feeling that comes with it. A feeling of never knowing you chose right. The Elohim voiceover (brilliantly done), messages and q&a's though the computer terminals and QR-codes were constantly trying to push me around. And when even the puzzles are trying to trick you, you know something is not right. I was always suspicious of who I could trust and what the results would be. Through this concept I really was engaged in the journey of the robot and it's search.\n\nAre you looking for a game that puzzles you in more ways than one?

If you like a good story you'll enjoy looking for terminals and reading the documents you find, if not, you can just skip it all. A big plus is that almost all of the puzzles aren't timed so you can take your time thinking about it and, if you are stuck and unable to solve one of the puzzles, you can just leave and go solve another one. A negative side for this game is it's graphics: while the areas themselves are beautiful, there isn't much variation and after doing few puzzles in the same level, it starts looking boring and dull. Also, at least at the time I played it (few months ago), only few of the latest save files were preserved, so, if you wished to revert back to some time ago (to try different choices, check different endings), you had to backup them manually.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/recommended/257510/","Soupinator","Soüp®: Legendary Edition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/","1293 products in account","The Talos Principle deserves a spot right next to Portal as an all-time great.  It is a first person puzzle game in the same vein, where your guide poses as a diety guiding you to salvation.  The narrative is highly philisophical as you complete puzzles and try to figure out the where and why of your situation, in contrast to Portal's very humorous tone.\n\nThis game was quite a surprise, coming from Croteam who are best known for the over the top oldschool FPS series Serious Sam which is purely about shooting monsters and bad jokes.  The Serious Sam influence is obvious in the graphical style (it uses the same engine as well) but otherwise there is no resemblance.  It is a great-looking and smooth-running game with a ridiculous number of options thanks to Croteam's Serious Engine.  Being their first puzzle game, it's quite a feat for them to create such a superb experience.\n\nBut to the game itself:  Puzzles are arranged in hub worlds, which you can visit at your leisure.  If you can't figure one out, you can go find another and come back to it later.  You solve puzzles using a rather unique set of tools from laser beams to the ability to record a temporary copy of yourself.  At the end of each puzzle is a tetromino sigil (tetris piece) that need to later be arranged in panels to unlock various content.  Easy sigils unlock more puzzle areas, medium sigils unlock more tools to solve puzzles with, while hard sigils allow you to ascend the tower in the main hub world.  There are also hidden star sigils scattered throughout the game you can collect to unlock additional puzzles which can be very difficult to locate.\n\nI found the puzzles to be very well-designed with a pretty smooth difficulty curve.  The stars however are a mixed bag.  For some reason, stars in the earlier, easier areas of the game are far more difficult to locate and obtain than those in the later, generally more difficult areas.  They'll be hidden in a tiny alcove in a giant map filled with ruins that have no purpose for puzzles, or require connecting lasers to hidden/invisible objects.  Later stars are often in plain view, and just require some extra thinking to reach.  I will admit I had to look at guides a few times just to figure out where the stars were, much less obtain them.\n\nIt's hard to say much more without being in danger of spoiling the story.  There is a ton of information in the game in the form of text and audio lore that is available if you are the sort of person who likes that.  Personally I found myself skipping over most of the text lore simply because there is so much of it and I wanted to get back to the puzzles, though it seems to be very well-written.\n\nTL;DR: If you want a first person puzzle game of a similar quality level as Portal, but with significantly more content than Portal 2, look no further.  The $40 asking price is a bargain for what this game offers.","January 20","true","35.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Everything about this title is masterfully done. Once I picked this title up on a Saturday morning, I literally didn't do much else until I saw the ending on Monday morning. Yep, its that good.\n\nHere is why you owe it to yourself to play this:\n\nThe game plays a *bit* like Portal, although the references are really not that necessary since The Talos Principle is certainly its own game. Yes, there are puzzles and yes, it is FPS perspective. Yes it also has an interesting storyline, but it takes itself much more seriously. The puzzles are way harder IMO, and the storyline is much, much deeper and overall fleshed out. Whats really cool about the puzzles, is that they will force you to think in a way you never have, and you will get good at it! This will allow you to solve them quicker as you progress, which makes you feel like a boss***.\n\nGraphically, this game is a beast. Every scene is a postcard. Seriously. Even more, the devs reward you by exploring. "Oh, look at the beautiful beach behind this flippin' castle that has nothing to do with the game - oh wow there is loot here!". The music is nothing short of epic either. Trust me on this - I cranked it the whole time.\n\nThe best part about this gem is the storyline. This is literally the most masterful writing I have ever read in a videogame. I have been chronically gaming since the mid '80s. The game is text-heavy for sure, but it will have you craving even more. All the philosophy is based in reality (most appeared cited, as well), which fed the armchair philosopher in me. I mean this game is part Biblical, part philosophy, and overall spiritual.  It will make you think.\n\nFunny thing is, I finished the entire game - all the puzzles (not all stars), saw all the endings, and only after FINALLY reading some forum posts (I restrained, and you should too), did I find out that there are literally a metric ton of Easter Eggs in this title. I won't spoil, but they are extensive - I don't mean like a sprite or two here-and-there, I mean like whole new level extensive.\n\n***After completing the entire game, I went and (for the first time) played the demo/benchmarking application, and literally ATE THE LEVELS LIKE CANDY. I mean my wife was going to watch me play, but first she had to get a slice of pizza from the kitchen, and by time she returned I was finishing the last puzzle LIKE A BOSS.\n\nLook, look, bottom line -  stop reading my text, go buy the game, don't read another word on the forums or anywhere else, and experience this art for yourself, because once you do, you will never look at gaming the same.","January 8, 2015","true","24.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

Deep, interesting, moving storyline married with polished, beatifully realised gameplay. The graphics are beautiful, albeit heavy on the lense-flare at times. The music is apt and the sound effects are expertly done. Voice acting (at least for English speakers) is top quality - particularly the moving Alexandra sound capsules you will hear throughout the story. The final cut scene was suitably poignant and yet, given what you've been through and what the end represents, epic.\n\nFor folks that like to think hours-to-complete is somehow relevant, it took me 23 hours to "finish". I'd discovered three (which I think is all) of the secret rooms, plus one absolutely wierd "extra" secret area within a secret area and I went to extra lengths to find what turned out to be an easter egg that revolves around, of all things, Aperture Science. I don't know what the Croteam guys have in relation to Valve, other than perhaps being fans, but it was pretty awesome nonetheless. However, I'd only unlocked five stars by the end and I suspect there's many more to find. Probably around 25 or so. I also read all the "local resources" that you find at computer terminals. Who knows, but you could probably speed run the game in half the time I spent absorbing it all.\n\nBut don't speed run this. This game is fantastic and deserves a bit of your time to immerse yourself in. Not just the puzzles, but the story, the atmosphere and the many, many secrets scattered around this wonderfully realised world.\n\nCouldn't recommend it enough.\n\nAre there bad points? I'd be nitpicking. Some of the sigil games can be pretty tough and they were my least favourite aspect of the Talos Principle. Yep, that's about it. Tough, challenging, deep, moving, beautiful. Buy it.\n\nI played through on Ubuntu 14.04 and it ran flawlessly, despite a warning that it couldn't detect my graphics card (which is a pretty standard Nvidia GTX).","December 14, 2014","true","24.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","2"

The difficulty ramps up slowly and you can always get help. You'll find out how ;-). The voice that guides you and all the messages you will find on the monitors gives some depth to the story. And the maps are full of nice Easter eggs that will make you smile when you find them.\nIf you liked the portal series, the Talos principle is for you. It is not as good because it lacks some verticality and of course a portal gun. But the esoteric part compensates it somehow.","April 22, 2015","true","29.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

It marries complex, compelling puzzle design with a sophisticated science fiction story told through intelligent writing. It doesn't waste your time, and it will expect you to be actively thinking in order to solve many of its puzzles.\n\nSeriously, if you dig sci-fi and puzzle games, you owe it to yourself to get this. The story is interesting enough that it's been stuck in my head for days, and the puzzles are at that special level of quality where I've actually picked out a few favorites based on how well-paced they were and how interesting the logical jumps were that they required. For the record my favorite puzzle in the game (after having solved all the puzzles one would solve on a base-level playthrough and only a few of the extra star puzzles) is Prison Break. You'll know it when you see it.

Outside of the more elementary gameplay mechanics the plot is just generally good SciFi. And simple mechanics used in a new way are what drive classic games\n\nIt's very obvious, at least to me, that this game is going to be as culturally significant to the genre as the Portal titles were.

They are all completely obvious yet freaking hard to figure out.\n\nWhile there is a bit of platforming involved the puzzles are really not about the execution as once you know what to do its generally easy to do it (still you will fail a lot).\n\nThe game does a very good job at teaching you the mechanics through 3 difficulty levels of puzzles green, yellow and red. Yet it still leaves some mechanics to be discovered (mainly if you want to get all the elusive hidden stars). Once you get bored with the puzzles there are tons of easter eggs hidden all through the game.\n\nAs a puzzle game, this game mainly stands on its mechanics and excellent puzzle design. However the story creates an excellent counterpoint and its presentation will leave you wanting more and more and more and will keep you thinking about what could be possible going on in this strange world.\n\nThe game has three distinct endings (plus some variants).

This game had one of my favorite puzzle elements that I'd never seen before which was that you could make a recording of yourself that would interact with the puzzle world as well. In this way, it almost felt like single player coop, which was a lot of fun. The game had a lot of substance, but I wish it had more of the hard puzzles. There were a few hard ones that stumped me for a while. I wish they had more difficult puzzles though, because the ones they had were really rewarding.\n\nThe story was very good, and was presented in such a way that you could skip the parts of the story you didn't care for. Music and graphics were good, but I would have enjoyed some tesselation so the ground and walls would have a bit more of a feel to them. For what it's worth, the design and layouts were pretty nice, so the flatness wasn't so bad.\n\nI'd highly recommend this game, but I'd say there is one thing I find disappointing about it. The disappointment is that it would benefit greatly from something like a map generator like in Portal 2.

But suppress all that gung-ho bloodlust for a few hours (or 20) and you'll find TP is actually a refreshing experience, if by refreshing you mean running round one arena for twenty minutes wondering why you are one cube short. The reason - as always in this game - is because you're an idiot and have learned nothing.\nThe learning curve is shallow at the start until you realise just how many puzzles there are, in addition to the easter eggs, puzzles behind secret doors, puzzles in distant places, and puzzles within (and often outside of) other puzzles. By the later stages, you're setting up cobweb-like networks of light beams, turning one block into two, travelling through time to stand on your own head and - when things go wrong - wondering where all the beams are going, which door just opened (or closed), watching essential objects fly back and forth through the air and (I kid you not) wondering whether to learn ASCII just to make sense of it all. Several times after wondering how I just did what I did, the follow-up thought was: 'how did someone write something that devious?'\nIt's all a little Portal, or perhaps a bloated Portal (but still challenging: Portal 2 take note), which is no bad thing. There's also a lot of reading waffle about consciousness and stuff which you can entirely ignore. But that's a puzzle game for you: brain over brawn; and at least if you run naked down the street wielding an axe and screaming "I am the word and the world is the words", no one will blame Croteam.\nWhat?

The game boils down complex philosophical texts and concepts in a way very digestible by non-philosophers.\n\nThis game moved me, and I found myself spending late nights pondering the meaning of what I had read. It's been a very long time since I bought a game and became so hooked that I played it through to the finish in just a week or two without really playing anything else. The puzzles fall under muscle memory in time, and they become busywork for your hands as your thoughts linger on the curiosity and emotion spawned from ingame computer messages and voice logs. The game affects you as much as you allow it to. The more you think on the concepts presented, the more you find parallels in real life. I can name at least three things this game has changed my view on in real life, and many more things that I felt have been reinforced. Not since college classes have I been driven to have such internal conversations on existential topics.\n\nThe puzzles are also the single weak point of the game, as the tetromino puzzles grow frustratingly boring. They appear whenever unlocking particular secret zones and some of the late-game content for some of the possible endings. They get so long-winded and frustrating that they outright interrupt the otherwise beautifully-crafted trains of thought and emotion the game guides you along. But that's a part of it--the frustration. I understand the reason behind the mechanic, but I still feel like it's a bit TOO real--a bit too harsh a method of teaching patience and perseverance.\n\nAnyone looking for an intelligent and wholly inspiring game should buy this. It's not flashy, it's not exciting (until the end!), and it's definitely more niche as it requires patience and attentiveness in a way very few games do...but beating this game was the most educational video game experience I've had, and easily one of the most fulfilling. The graphics and environments are beautiful, the voice acting is remarkable, and the pacing of the game is spot-on. You can tell the developers playtested the game rigorously, and they know very well the many ways players will approach The Talos Principle's challenges...and boy does that really drive the narrative.\n\nAs for me, I'm off to buy the DLC and blow my mind a second time.\n\nThank you, Croteam.","September 26, 2015","true","47.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The visuals are super clean and colorful. The quantity of puzzles is staggering. Weird as it may seem in a game like this, the story is actually the thing I remember the most. Specifically, the conversations with the Milton Library Assistant are engaging and sometimes unpleasant. You just have to experience it for yourself.\n\nThis is still a puzzle game through and through, and solving these puzzles is what you'll spend 90% of your time doing. Every puzzle mechanic is used with each other in every combination quite nicely, and the game allows for a lot of freedom when it comes to which puzzle you want to attempt next. The only downside to The Talos Principle is the overused puzzle involving tetris pieces. When tackled sporadically they aren't too bad, but they could've used a bit more variety. This is an excellent puzzle game that will challenge you with its puzzles and please you with its graphics and atmosphere.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/obsidian_age/recommended/257510/","obsidian_age","Obsidian Age","http://steamcommunity.com/id/obsidian_age/","1718 products in account","The Talos Principle is a game I'd strongly recommend. I was initially hesitant due to the price, and eventually got it on special. Having now completed the game, I can honestly say that it is well worth the full price! This game is an absolute gem, and I cannot recommend it strongly enough! To aid in your decisions for purchasing this game I've broken down my review into positives, negatives, and points that are neither strongly positive or negative.\n\nThe Positives\nThe gameplay mechanics themselves. The game concepts are, in themselves, incredibly straightforward -- it takes almost no time whatsoever to learn how to make use of each object you are presented. However, while straightforward to learn, the concepts are extremely difficult to master. While the early levels in the game may seem outright trivial, some of the later ones will really leave you scratching your head!\n\nHidden stars. While the game itself is all about collecting the sigils, there is actually another type of collectible -- stars. The star puzzles are far, *far* harder to complete than the original puzzles. If you thought the main game was too easy, try and collect each of the stars. Some of the more challenging stars will literally take you *hours* to work out how to obtain!\n\nMultiple solutions to puzzles. Due to what I can only assume is brilliant level design, each solution to each puzzle is roughly as difficult to achieve. You may not end up solving a puzzle the way that was intended, but your method certainly won't be a cakewalk!\n\nMultiple endings. There are three unique endings to The Talos Principle. Will you ascend the tower, or resist its temptation? Or perhaps you will explore the lands to find all the hidden secrets, and unlock a third ending?\n\nDecisions galore! In addition to the main puzzle-solving gameplay, there is an integral AI that can be spoken to through the terminals scattered throughout the worlds. The AI will often ask you questions that have multiple answers. Each answer branches out into a response that will contain another question with a completely different set of answers.\n\nThe psychological and philosophical aspect. The Talos Principle has the player answer questions that delve deep into psychology and philosophy. These questions range from discussions over whether liberty or freedom is more important, to subjective views on what it means to be human. These questions are so deep that you're bound to learn something about yourself.\n\nOutright promotion of the thought process required to break many games. While each puzzle in the Talos Principle is self-contained, to achieve many of the hidden stars you will have to break some of the levels by either smuggling items in or smuggling items out. As long as there's not an obstacle in the way, you essentially have free reign in the worlds.\n\nEaster eggs galore! There are literally *dozens* of hidden Easter eggs contained in The Talos Principle. These Easter eggs are so masterfully hidden that even the exploration veterans will struggle to find them.\n\nBuilding upon classics games in a way that honours each.You use cubes and lasers to open doors, akin to Portal. There are hidden stars to collect, akin to Super Mario 64. You use the sigils you collect to unlock locks by assembling them in a way similar to Tetris. Not only does The Talos Principle pay homage to such games, but utilises their concepts in a way that said games would be proud of.\n\nStunning graphics! Throughout the game, you'll travel from Greek ruins, to ancient Egypt, to Nordic fortresses and English castles. The variety makes for a difficult combination of animations, yet each one is done absolutely beautifully. Each location feels crisp, and really adds to the atmosphere.\n\nTrue gameplay and performance customisation. While many games have the ability to change things like aspect ratio and graphics settings, The Talos Principle takes settings customisation to lengths that I have *never* seen in any other game. There are separate customisations menus for both the CPU and GPU! From adjusting the brightness and gamma, to lighting in reflections, to four different types of antialiasing, to the type of filter used for rescaling, The Talos Principle allows you to customise every last little performance detail.\n\nRoad To Gehenna DLC. The Road To Gehenna changes protagonist, leads you to brand new lands, adds much harder puzzles, and fleshes out the original story. On top of all that, it *dramatically* fleshes out the terminal systems. Instead of chatting to the regular AI, you now play a user of a messageboard system created by the residents of Gehenna. Performing certain actions on the messageboards allow you to rank-up in the system, which in turn allows you to read private topics that reveal more about the world around you. There's *multiple* MUD games to play through the messageboards, each of which are thoroughly enjoyable. Honestly, the Road To Gehenna is such an amazing DLC that it could be released as a stand-alone game!\nThe Neutral\nStar locations. While I love the concept of the stars and the challenge of obtaining them, I feel as though there is a bit of a disconnect in their physical locations. Stars can be in individual levels, the outer worlds, or even the hubs. Each world shows how many stars are in it, but gives absolutely no clue as to whether they are in certain levels or the outer world itself. Some of these stars are hidden *very* well.The challenge really should be in working out out how to *get* the star, not how to *find* the star.\n\nThe audio. There's a few fairly generic, laid-back audio tracks in the game. While they work well for adventuring and solving the puzzles, there is very limited variety. It would have been nice to have a bit more tension for some of the harder puzzles, or at least a few tracks in different genres. Naturally, you can always mute the game and play your own music if you'd prefer.\n\nThe save system. The game auto-saves often, which is great if the game crashes. There are a number of different auto-save slots, but there is no option to make a manual save. One of the endings thrusts you right back into the start of the game, and you can easily accidentally overwrite your progress if you progress too far.\nThe Negatives\nThe story that doesn't really feel very fleshed-out. Both the opening cutscene and closing cutscenes are very short compared to most modern games. As you progress, a bit of the reasoning behind you being there and information about the world itself are revealed, but it still feels as though the game would have benefited from longer cutscenes.\n\nRare instances wherein objects become unusable. At one point I put down a jammer and for some reason I was completely unable to pick it back up. I couldn't interact with anything in the level, and was forced to restart the level.\n\nHigh thresholds for performance options. While there is an absolute plethora of customisation options for performance, The Talos Principle tries to set a benchmark based on your computer specifications. Unfortunately, this benchmark is a little high. I've got a fairly decent computer, so my graphics settings were set to 'Ultra' by default. This caused some lag spikes in some situations, and even resulted in the game presenting me a BSOD at one point.\nAll in all, I'd give The Talos Principle a 9.5/10. This is one of the best games that I have played in a *long* time, and one that should definitely be picked up!","February 13","true","62.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A philosophical science fiction puzzle game made by the developers of Serious Sam. I really like it.\n\nThe game looks so beautiful and it runs pretty darn well. I have 280X and i7 2600k and I've set everything almost to the max, solid 60FPS. It also probably has the biggest amount of graphics and physics settings of all games I've ever played and I've played a lot of games. You can change everything from transparency anti-aliasing to ambient occulsion precision.\n\nGameplay. The character movement is superb. It's like in Source games (eg. CS:GO), moving the camera with mouse is presice as laser beam and walking and strafing around with WASD just feels so good.\n\nAnd then two main points in the whole game and this review.\n\nPuzzles, they are excellent like in Portal 2 and in its modification, Portal Stories: Mel. At first, they are pretty easy but still fun to do. Things will get slowly harder and harder, but don't get me wrong, hard =/= frustrating, it's still fun! As you progress you will unlock new puzzle tools and a lot more complex puzzles in different locations all around the world.\n\nAnd the second main point, its story. Like I said, it's a philosophical science fiction puzzle game. I don't want to spoil too much but the game makes you think more about artificial intelligence, faith and yourself. At first you probably just think that you are in some kind of a heaven (or hell?) where some god speaks to you and is about to give you an eternal life if you can prove your faith and bla bla. But it's so much more than that. When you advance, you'll start to find pieces of information about the past, other people and things that have happened. Maybe it's not heaven after all, it's something much much worse (or better). But lets not spoil too much. Just buy it and start playing. You will get hooked, you can't stop playing.\n\nOh, and did I already mention that there are absolutely no loading times anywhere!\n\ntl;dr One of the best puzzle games I've ever played.

Puzzles may be absurdly easy and seem entirely out of place (e.g. Skyrim), needlessly lengthening parts of the game, or their extreme difficulty may grind gameplay to a halt (e.g. Silent Hill series). However, just as Valve so brilliantly defied this rule with the Portal series years ago, Croteam manage in The Talos Principle to seamlessly integrate an interesting plot, as well as a mystifying lore, with absolutely exceptional puzzles. And where Portal and its sequel excel in wit and ironic humour, The Talos Principle achieves profundity, treating meaningfully and thoughtfully the most fundamental questions of philosophy and ethics, without being pretentious. The texts and audio files found throughout the world constitute a fully realized and intriguing lore, and dialogue with the Milton character is fascinating and thought-provoking; however, the game never forces any philosophy, or even the discussion of philosophy at all, upon the player. It made my experience richer by a hundredfold, but if it's not quite your cup of tea, and you're playing simply for the joy of the puzzles, then you may ignore it and skip it all and still have a perfectly wonderful experience.\n\nEverything about this game, from its user interface and its world design, is absolutely beautiful (the last world, the Land of Faith, is the most striking). However, encountering over and over again very similarly designed ruins can, after many hours in the same world, leave one with a dull impression. The mechanics are smooth and seamless, without any of the usual annoyances or hitches, such as slow movement and limited sprinting. The puzzles themselves are progressively and rewardingly challenging, and, unlike so many other puzzle games, non-linear. Some of the game's more complex puzzles actually have multiple possible solutions, even incorporating one's solutions to other puzzles in the same level, and, if one gets stuck, a puzzle may be skipped and saved for later (up to a point, of course). Finally, the conclusion quite perfectly wraps up the narrative and allows the player a glimpse behind the veil of the lore, as the developers offer their own answer to question underlying it all: "What does it mean to be human?"\n\nTo anyone who loves thoughtful puzzles and thoughtful narrative, I wholeheartedly recommend this masterpiece of design and concept.\n\n10/10 - Superb","December 28, 2015","true","33.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Because, again, the game is good.\nThe plot, even though it's smeared on almost 20 hours of game-play, is nice and catching with all the reasoning, philosophy and physics. Graphics are top notch (mostly) and anyway always visually rewarding. Same could be said for the soundtrack that was never able to bore me even if I was listening to it for 20 hours straight. Probably something more could have been done on sound effects, sometimes they felt repetitive or missing.\n\nI'd like to talk a bit more about those puzzles, because the concept is great, and the realization is great too, when I was given a puzzle I had to think to solve it was fun and rewarding, but then I was given the same puzzle, with minor differences that took me a minute or less to understand and I lost tenth of minutes just running around with puzzle pieces, bored, so bored I'd actually fail falling or being killed because I was rushing to end the thing ASAP, furthermore increasing the boredom adding some frustration.\nAnd again, certain puzzles were great and on others I even gave up (more or less 1/3 of the "stars") so challenging they were, I just cannot stand this "same puzzle over and over" thing, sorry. Not to mention that to beat the game you HAVE to complete all the puzzles (except for the "stars").\n\nTo conclude, in my opinion this game could have been on the same level of Portal if it had 1/3 of the puzzles it has (or even less), so that the narration would have been a bit more fast paced and catching and every puzzle would have felt a new challenge.\n\nNOTE: Italian dub is not that good and Italian translation isn't either, since reading a lot of text on a foreign language is quite demanding I still opted for the Italian translation, but I couldn't really stand the dub too, so I played the game with the original English voice acting and Italian subs/text; if you feel very confident with the English language I'd suggest you to play the whole game (speech, subs and text) in English language.","January 10","true","34.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Things like the writing work hand in hand with the overlying story to create depth and intrigue at an early stage and make you want to progress more than any other game I've played in recent memory.\n\nHighlights\nThe subtle gameplay and level design choices throughout The Talos Principle are so incredibly well done that the first playthrough is nothing short of incredibly engaging fun. You're taught to interact with the world and not take anything for granted which means you're unaware that you're improving and more importantly unaware that you're thinking in a different way and genuinely unlocking different avenues of thought in your own mind.\nTerminals, for example, contain short segments of text that serve the overall narrative, but also change pitch every so often, and coupled with the mythological, religious and historical tales and references and things like recordings scattered throughout the world, you'll often unknowingly have expectations of what's expected of you. The writing and design set up a box then encourages you to think outside of it and it makes everything more rewarding.\n\nOther subtle changes like the complete lack of timed puzzles which make up the vast majority of other titles, and the lack of direct linear progression, and lack of any direct demand of the player to continue means we progress in the game of our own accord, and it helps us tie ourselves into the story and feel part of the world.\n\n* The sheer technical design and tuning which show off more of the stellar design is impressive. Cross platform support, console access and inside mod support, outside mod support for Steam Workshop and more all add replayability to an already lengthy title.\n* There wide array of configuration options deserve praise, you can adjust almost any aspect of the technicals.\n\nMistakes & Annoyances\nThe biggest annoyance of this game is the standard it sets for itself early on, and in not maintaining the incredible level of curiosity and quality of writing up until the end. It's hard to complain about a game offering this much content and length, but when the latter third of the game doesn't hold up as much as the first third, it can feel slightly weary or repetitive at times to continue.\n\n* Due to the somewhat floaty movement and bright colour scheme, it's very easy to feel nausea or motion sickness while playing this game, though there are an impressive set of tools to adjust these settings under an aptly named Motion Sickness sub-menu\n\nRecommendations\nPriced at £29.99/39.99€/$39.99 and only 19.99€ in Steam European Region 2, The Talos Principle is at the top range of what I'm personally willing to pay for a video game, and more expensive than related games like Portal 2, and even more than the inflated prices of some of the triple A titles. As a result, I find it hard to call this good value for everyone, but because of the very well designed and polished gameplay and the average play time of at least 16 hours, people paying full price are not going to feel ripped off and if you're the target market, someone who enjoys first person puzzle games with a great backstory and interesting details, it's a good buy even at full price. For the rest of us, I'd suggest it's worth waiting for a sale of -50% or more.\n\n* The Road To Gehenna DLC adds four new episodes with much harder difficulty (but by no means cheap in approach, nor needlessly difficult) with an open approach and a different take on the game and an equally great and interesting story/narrative. None of this is just more-of-the-same and it's a great DLC worth buying for people who have already enjoyed the full game. Fairly priced at £10.99/14.99€/$14.99, as with the main game, cheapest from EU2.\n* The Serious DLC adds a Serious Sam character model and a new voice for Elohim and may be worth £1.99/2.99€/$2.99 for Serious Sam fans, but is a waste of time otherwise considering other models and skins are available free within the Steam Workshop.\n* The Prototype DLC adds 100+ puzzles, the majority of which are simply recycled designs from the pre-alpha to release of the game. You'll revisit many levels from the main game with flaws or without nice modelling/background and as a result may feel like you're wasting time or being cheated. There is one exclusive world included, and this DLC offers support for many Steam Workshop mods and offers two new Elohim voice-overs. If you can put up with retreading old maps with annoying issues, it may be worth the £3.99/4.99€/$4.99\n\n* A free demo is available on the Store page for anyone still on the fence.\n* Check the Steam Workshop after completing the game where you can find a number of skins (Companion Cube Hexahedrons anyone?) and more maps.\n* There's a prelude game available on Steam called Sigils of Elohim featuring a number of the Sigil formation puzzles. It's available for free and includes 12 Relics for The Talos Principle.","July 25, 2015","true","29.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This Review and The Game We Are Looking At Are Made of Words.Genre: Single Player First/Third Person Puzzler, Story Driven with Philosophical Topics.\nDeveloped & Published by: Croteam and Devolver Digital\nPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and PS4\nBusiness Model: Single Purchase + Expansion DLC\nCopy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged review that can't fit in Steam reviews on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]\n\nOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nThe Talos Principle is a single player first person puzzle game that focuses on a philosophical heavy narrative and logic based trial and error puzzles. It combines stellar visuals, a relaxed soundtrack and great writing to create a compelling experience. You’ll get about 36 to 40 hours of content with the base game and DLC expansion combined. Which is a lot more time than I had expected to get. Though that will, of course, vary from player to player depending on how well they can solve these type of puzzles, whether they use guides to get through the game or pursue the bonus stars and hidden secrets. Like all good first person puzzle games, the temptation to use Internet guides can be hard to resist and there are some very good Steam Guides that’ll help the player along. If you enjoy this type of puzzle solving, I implore you to try and figure each puzzle out on your own. It’s a really rewarding experience, at least it was for myself, to solve a puzzle I had been stuck on for a while. However, it’s ultimately your choice.\n\nPuzzle Mechanics\nThere was never any puzzle I truly disliked or thought “man, that was terribly designed”. Most of the time, it was just my own ineptitude that prevented me from solving it. Though I think star puzzles were just the developers being cruel to us mere mortals. I will admit that I used a guide a couple of times for story and star puzzles when I just couldn’t figure out a particular puzzle. Which led to me finding out that I missing a single step in my logic chain. Cue the expletives. Although there were a couple in Road to Gehenna that I was legitimately stuck on. Overall, I really enjoyed the puzzle design in this game and how unique every puzzle felt like, even though it only had a set amount of mechanics to work with. It always felt like a new challenge that I was gunhoe to tackle head on.\n\nThe Talos Principle Story\nThe Talos Principle is an exploration of freedom, free choice, religion, personal beliefs, the meaning of life, hope, hopelessness, life, death and what has come before. So many different themes are brought up but remain consistent to this central theme that it's trying to explore. It doesn’t force a particular moral. But it does ask the player to consider the themes it presents. It explores how strong your conviction is in your ideals and where those ideals may lead. This combines well with the puzzle and audio design which encourages the player to slow down and consider the puzzles both in the game and in life itself. There’s a subtlety to this game that makes it hard to describe without giving too much away. But I can say that how you respond will affect the narrative a little and the game will remember it.\n\nPC Settings & Video/Audio\nTTP is built on the Serious Engine and contains a wealth of PC settings for the player to customize their experience. The performance options include default settings for the CPU/GPU as well as the ability to completely customize them. The GPU settings page here alone scrolls for a long while and I won’t list out every single option. But everything from texture filtering to lighting effects to shadows is all here and it’s an insane amount of choices. I’m pretty sure it’s the biggest list of options I’ve ever seen. Steam workshop support and a benchmark tool are in it as well. Game can be launched in either 32bit or 64bit. Sound options include sliders for master, effects and music volume. It’s extremely well optimized and I had no trouble getting it to run at 1080p 60FPS while running at ultra settings for the CPU and GPU. I didn’t notice much texture pop-in, poorly done textures or other visual glitches (outside of intentional visual glitches) that could ruin one’s experience. Outside of first starting the game and having the game sometimes take a while to load textures. All in all, an impressive amount of options.\n\nAll of these puzzles in the base game are handled in three hub worlds and a massive tower. The three hub worlds feature their own unique environments and music. Each environment is absolutely gorgeous to look at. I can’t help but think that the Talos Principle may have been crafted just to show off what the Serious Engine can do when when it’s not about blowing up aliens trying to invade the earth. The soundtrack is a relaxing yet haunting orchestra that fits the visual design of the place you’re visiting. The audio design is further complemented with atmospheric touches to draw the player in.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThe Talos Principle is one of my favorite puzzle games of all time. The puzzles are very well designed, challenging yet don’t depend on gimmicky mechanics to be hard. The philosophical, religious and social commentary on past and present culture is handled very well to show multiple points of views without being overbearing in any particular way. I think what I find even more impressive for myself is that I didn’t find the 36 hours I played to get boring. I have never enjoyed a premise, game mechanics as a whole or the entire pacing of the game as much as I have for The Talos Principle. During the 36 hours I spent, never once did I want it to simply end and be done with. Each new puzzle felt unique and had a reason to exist beyond simply being iterative design. The music and atmosphere combine to encourage the players to slow down and contemplate the challenge in front of them. What’s even more impressive is that the game mechanics and story compliment each other really well. The visuals are stunning, showcasing Roman, Greek and Egyptian architecture and beautiful worlds to explore. Even at the end of the long journey through TTP, I still want more puzzles to solve, more philosophical discussion to ponder and ideas to challenge. I still want more and yet if this is all that will come from TTP, I am satisfied with the experience I had. It’s so rare to have that kind of feeling about a game. This is one of the few rare gems in gaming that I get to experience and I definitely recommend it.\n\nRead the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]Road To Gehenna DLC Thoughts","March 4","true","37.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The atmosphere of the game grabs you from the start with its amazing puzzle design and great writing. Provoking narrative, philosophical and metaphysical questions, this game really makes you wonder. Even though it’s very demanding and intense, I couldn’t put the game away when I played it. You constantly have questions that you want answered and it makes you keep thinking, even when after you stop playing.\nYou play as a sentient artificial intelligence placed within a simulation. From the start you have this narrative voice who explains himself as your god, your creator. You question his logic and you read from other people who both obey and disobey him. As you follow the storyline you read a lot of texts which are written by various people iside the game.\n\nAs you are artificial intelligence yourself you also communicate with a help program who asks you tons of questions. You constantly wonder why you are in this simulation, how to get out, what’s outside of the simulation, who’s behind it, there’s always so many questions!\n\nOne thing I didn’t like about the game or what I would want to see more of, is that you should question Elohim (your god) and his logic straight to his face. I would like to see more chaos from Elohim and his reaction as you confront him. Much like Glados from portal who tries to kill you when you don't do as she says.\nIf you’re not the kind of guy who plays for the story, then maybe this game is not for you. I try my best to read everything and follow every single bit when I play. Either way this is one of my favorite and most memorable games I’ve ever played and I would suggest this game even though it’s quite challenging.","June 20, 2015","true","18.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So I went into that thinking this might be similar. And in a way, this game is just like portal, but completely turned upside down. The basic layout is the same: You solve interesting puzzles chambers to proceed. The setting however is completely different. Where Portal is about british sarcasm and the interesting storyline between you and GLaDOS (in my opinion), The Talos Principle is a lot more about the existance of life, AI, beautiful scenery and at time exhausting philosophical questions. You can play the game at your own pace, which is something I personally like and you can constantly make your own decisions. And believe me when I say certain choices have a huge impact on the game.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are do-able, and occasionally very difficult. I solved them all without help from the internet, just 1 tip from a friend was all I needed to complete all the puzzles. But that doesn't mean they are easy. Some took me incredibly long to solve, but when you do find the solution, it just feels so good! The philosophical stuff they tell you in the game really interested me and gets you thinking. It's some serious stuff, really. After playing for a couple hours straight I was mentally tired of solving all the puzzles and thinking about all these deep issues. You could skip most of it if you really don't care about it, though I don't recommend it because that will remove maybe the biggest part of the game. The narritive (the story) in this game is not the best, but it is very solid and well made. The main focus  of this game are ethical, philosophical questions and the puzzles.\n\nThere are also tons of extra things to get, like in Mario, many secret items to find and collect. These can be REALLY hard to collect (I collected only 10% of them I think without help). But if you like more challenges, you can put a lot more time in this game if you want!\nOh one more thing: There are some brilliant (hard to find) Easer Eggs in this game. Try to find them!\n\n\nAll and all, I had the greatest experience playing this game. It was really fun, rewarding and challenging.\nIf you like challenging puzzles wrapped up in some narrative and a lot of complex philisophical issues, this game is THE perfect game for you! Definately worth it's money! Now I'm off to play the DLC!","December 24, 2015","true","40.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Thinking this, I waited a while before buying it, and now I must say, I regret not picking it up earlier.\n\nI dont think I've ever played a game, that asks the player some of the classic philosophical questions, in such an engaging and creative way as the Talos Principle. What makes us human? What is a soul? What is consciousness? Can a machine achieve it? Those questions have been used plenty of times before, and you may have noticed them in for example movies like the Ghost in the Machine, Bladerunner or Ex Machina. But the Talos Priciple uses them in its own unique way.\n\nThere's no denying that Portal and the Talos Priciple have similarities. After all they both revolve around solving puzzles, they have great music scores and voiceacting, and they have pretty similar game mechanics. But thats where I think the similarities end. Where Portal was set in a more confined space, with a playful story and quirky characters, the Talos Priciple is a much more serious take on the genre, with beautiful landscapes to admire and few characters to interact with.\n\nOf course you can just run through the puzzles and ignore the story, but the game wants you to take your time, and ponder on your last action or a message you just heard. And i must admit, that learning more about the world, by finding hidden files or audiologs, felt very rewarding and gave my actions in game more depth than i thought they had to begin with. I dont want to spoil too much about the story and characters, since i feel like this game is best experienced personally, but i highly recommend it","March 6","true","29.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Let me just say - this game is exactly as good as it promises to be. That said, one of these reviews here said this game was "good for wasting a couple hours". Taking that to literally mean "a couple hours", I started playing the game and got completely addicted. ~60 hours later, I couldn't stop because the story was so good, and I just wanted so badly to see how it would all end. I became stuck in puzzle hell, much like the other characters trapped in the game with me, forever searching for the way out.\n\n10/10 would walk through puzzle hell again.\n\nPros:\nI loved the story and got completely hooked despite my general dislike of puzzle games\nStory really keeps you guessing. It's like a puzzle/mystery at first\nMost puzzles are completely unique and force you to think outside the box\nGame is a real challenge; people who say they breezed through it are either lying or geniuses\nLots of easter eggs\nFunny QR codes (messages in game)\nTONS of content; you'll be playing this forever, stuck in puzzle hell like me\nChoose your ending (or do them all): obey Elohim, rebel against Elohim, or support Elohim\nVery satisfying endings, no matter which you choose\nCons:\nIt can really become tedious. Take a lot of breaks and you'll be fine.\nThe reason the humans all died off was not immediately clear and could easily be missed\nThe guy in the computer kept putting words in my mouth.

The story is quite intriguing and mainly given through voice and text archives, fragments of mythology, science, literature, history and personal information such as letters and audio diaries.\nThis game features multiple endings while also addressing religious subjects, although it's strictly allegorical, metaphorical and plot-driven.\nI highly recommend The Talos Principle aswell as Road to Gehenna DLC.","January 12","true","38.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The visuals are super clean and colorful. The quantity of puzzles is staggering. Weird as it may seem in a game like this, the story is actually the thing I remember the most. Specifically, the conversations with the Milton Library Assistant are engaging and sometimes unpleasant. You just have to experience it for yourself.\n\nThis is still a puzzle game through and through, and solving these puzzles is what you'll spend 90% of your time doing. Every puzzle mechanic is used with each other in every combination quite nicely, and the game allows for a lot of freedom when it comes to which puzzle you want to attempt next. The only downside to The Talos Principle is the overused puzzle involving tetris pieces. When tackled sporadically they aren't too bad, but they could've used a bit more variety. This is an excellent puzzle game that will challenge you with its puzzles and please you with its graphics and atmosphere.

Overall, I think it's a very well done game with clever puzzles, a great story, and excellent audio.\n\nUltimately, because of the lack of diversity in the settings you'll be solving puzzles in, I don't feel the mechanics alone support the length of this game (assuming you're going for collectiong most of everything). Fortunately, an excellent story penned, in part, by Tom Jubert who wrote the excellent story for the surprisingly philosophical "The Swapper."  In The Talos Principle, the story explores philosophical ideas about identity, existence, the self, and morality.  While not revelatory to anybody versed in the field, for those who know little or have only a limited, casual interest in philosophy, there is interesting ideas to be explored within this game.\n\nThe difficulty curve for the puzzles is excellent, and if you want to find some of the more hidden collectables, you'll need to really think inventively and outside the box with how to utilize your limited tools.\n\nOverall, I had fun. Near the end I was finishing it more for the story than out of pure enjoyment of the puzzles, but that still carried me through with the desire to see some of the alternate endings as well.  If you enjoy puzzles or if you found the fusion of story-driven narrative mixed with puzzles compelling, it's definitely worth checking out!","December 30, 2015","true","17.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/recommended/257510/","mcdux0r","dux0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/","1067 products in account","A first person puzzle adventure that builds a world around excellent puzzle design with a fantastic and engaging philosophical backstory that wont let go of your interest and curiosity.\n\nFrom my very first moments of exploring and interacting with the world, I knew I'd found something I was going to enjoy, and while the level of design and subtle mood are all work to set the game up incredibly well, there are some subtle interwoven design choices that make this title something special, and it took me a lot of playtime to figure out why I enjoyed The Talos Principle beyond just being an excellent first person Puzzle game with rich story. Things like the writing work hand in hand with the overlying story to create depth and intrigue at an early stage and make you want to progress more than any other game I've played in recent memory.\n\nHighlights\nThe subtle gameplay and level design choices throughout The Talos Principle are so incredibly well done that the first playthrough is nothing short of incredibly engaging fun. You're taught to interact with the world and not take anything for granted which means you're unaware that you're improving and more importantly unaware that you're thinking in a different way and genuinely unlocking different avenues of thought in your own mind.\nTerminals, for example, contain short segments of text that serve the overall narrative, but also change pitch every so often, and coupled with the mythological, religious and historical tales and references and things like recordings scattered throughout the world, you'll often unknowingly have expectations of what's expected of you. The writing and design set up a box then encourages you to think outside of it and it makes everything more rewarding.\n\nOther subtle changes like the complete lack of timed puzzles which make up the vast majority of other titles, and the lack of direct linear progression, and lack of any direct demand of the player to continue means we progress in the game of our own accord, and it helps us tie ourselves into the story and feel part of the world.\n\n* The sheer technical design and tuning which show off more of the stellar design is impressive. Cross platform support, console access and inside mod support, outside mod support for Steam Workshop and more all add replayability to an already lengthy title.\n* There wide array of configuration options deserve praise, you can adjust almost any aspect of the technicals.\n\nMistakes & Annoyances\nThe biggest annoyance of this game is the standard it sets for itself early on, and in not maintaining the incredible level of curiosity and quality of writing up until the end. It's hard to complain about a game offering this much content and length, but when the latter third of the game doesn't hold up as much as the first third, it can feel slightly weary or repetitive at times to continue.\n\n* Due to the somewhat floaty movement and bright colour scheme, it's very easy to feel nausea or motion sickness while playing this game, though there are an impressive set of tools to adjust these settings under an aptly named Motion Sickness sub-menu\n\nRecommendations\nPriced at £29.99/39.99€/$39.99 and only 19.99€ in Steam European Region 2, The Talos Principle is at the top range of what I'm personally willing to pay for a video game, and more expensive than related games like Portal 2, and even more than the inflated prices of some of the triple A titles. As a result, I find it hard to call this good value for everyone, but because of the very well designed and polished gameplay and the average play time of at least 16 hours, people paying full price are not going to feel ripped off and if you're the target market, someone who enjoys first person puzzle games with a great backstory and interesting details, it's a good buy even at full price. For the rest of us, I'd suggest it's worth waiting for a sale of -50% or more.\n\n* The Road To Gehenna DLC adds four new episodes with much harder difficulty (but by no means cheap in approach, nor needlessly difficult) with an open approach and a different take on the game and an equally great and interesting story/narrative. None of this is just more-of-the-same and it's a great DLC worth buying for people who have already enjoyed the full game. Fairly priced at £10.99/14.99€/$14.99, as with the main game, cheapest from EU2.\n* The Serious DLC adds a Serious Sam character model and a new voice for Elohim and may be worth £1.99/2.99€/$2.99 for Serious Sam fans, but is a waste of time otherwise considering other models and skins are available free within the Steam Workshop.\n* The Prototype DLC adds 100+ puzzles, the majority of which are simply recycled designs from the pre-alpha to release of the game. You'll revisit many levels from the main game with flaws or without nice modelling/background and as a result may feel like you're wasting time or being cheated. There is one exclusive world included, and this DLC offers support for many Steam Workshop mods and offers two new Elohim voice-overs. If you can put up with retreading old maps with annoying issues, it may be worth the £3.99/4.99€/$4.99\n\n* A free demo is available on the Store page for anyone still on the fence.\n* Check the Steam Workshop after completing the game where you can find a number of skins (Companion Cube Hexahedrons anyone?) and more maps.\n* There's a prelude game available on Steam called Sigils of Elohim featuring a number of the Sigil formation puzzles. It's available for free and includes 12 Relics for The Talos Principle.","July 25, 2015","true","29.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Most don't give this game enough credit and if I am to be honest, I may fail to do so aswell and I mean that in the best regards.\n\nThis game takes hours, and I mean hours. It has a non linear path that you can choose, but some areas do have some requirements, it can all be done at your own pace. At the time of this review, I've played 17 hours over two days and I have the feeling I'm not even half way there. A massive amount of puzzles to resolve and it carries the right balance of simplicity and complexity. Some are so complex, these secret puzzles can even work to outside of the puzzle areas, some including multiple. It was well thought out in such an unbelievable degree.\n\nQuite a few reviews mentioned a philosophical side to this game aswell, and its true, its behind the lore of this game. I haven't decovered the areas behind it yet but it adds a layer of immersion, a sense of mystery. It builds up more and it makes you not only think about the puzzles, but the environment around you, the lands, the ones before you and the voice and so much more. It all works amazing, and that is part of what makes the game so great. It feels like not just a puzzle game, but an adventure and a learning experience in a fun and enjoyable way.\n\nPros: (I may repeat the above)\n-Long enduring play time\n-Large amount of puzzles\n-Increasingly expanding ideas for puzzles (Take it as you will)\n-All puzzles are apart of a larger puzzle\n-Graphics are great (If someone complains about crashes, they don't have a good enough system and mines semi par, works beauiful at Med settings)\n-Some Dlc's are great\n-You have an element of choice in the path (For a puzzle game? you bet your ♥♥♥ it does)\n\nCons:\n-Long periods of straight hour sessions may cause headaches (I need to take some breaks but it can be a good thing, makes you really think in later sessions)\n-Some puzzles can be very difficult and fustrating, but not too hard (Generally need time to think, patience friend)\n-Some Dlc's aren't worth the money (I stuck to Road to Gehenna as a good one)\n\nThats it. An absolutely fantastic game. Greater value than your CoD's and Battlefields at a cheaper price and larger and more grander puzzling experience than both Portal and Portal 2 combined. I would recommend it to everyone. A great way to improve some skill sets.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/recommended/257510/","genoforprez","genoforprez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/","385 products in account","An excellent game in every respect. Looks incredibly gorgeous and is well-optimized (runs like a dream for how great it looks).\n\nBasically, Talos Principle is a first-person puzzle chamber game in the tradition of Portal. There have been a lot of puzzle chamber games since Portal, but it has been incredibly frustrating how many of those games just want to copycat portal. The Talos Principle is the breath of fresh air you've been waiting for in the genre, though, since it is a first person puzzle chamber game with completely original puzzle mechanics and a completely original concept. The only real overlaps with Portal is that it's sci-fi, there are robots, and sometimes you have to put a cube on a button.\n\nThe vast majority of the puzzles in TTP are laser-connecting puzzles, where you have to move/place connector nodes to guide different color lasers from an origin point, around corners, through windows, etc, to a receptor. You can also split lasers into multiple beams at each connector node. There are certain restrictions, such as being limited to one color laser passing through a connector at a time and---most importantly---laser beams cannot ever cross, regardless of color, as they will disrupt each other. This is where the game being in three dimensions comes into play, since you can place the connectors at different elevations to prevent your lasers from crossing or to connect a laser beam over a wall.\n\nYou will of course have all sorts of other toys to play with, such as jammers (placable objects that can jam a single electronic device in play), fans (blow things around), duplicators (create a clone of yourself to help yourself co-op a solution), and many more.\n\nThe individual puzzle chambers in TTP are very satisfying in and of themselves, but true hardcore puzzle enthusiasts will be even more gratified in hunting down the game's secret stars. These are "secret" objectives in the game that often require you to think far outside the box. These puzzles encourage you to experiment with the mechanics in the game in a way that "games the system", so to speak, such as finding a way to get on top of a wall you were not "supposed" to get on top of, or finding a way to direct a laser beam from puzzle chamber #1 over a wall, through the hub, and into puzzle chamber #3 where it was never "supposed" to go, etc. The stars require a lot of patience, a keen eye for detail, and some thinking outside the box.\n\nThat being said, I was rather unsatisfied with two (and only two) of the star puzzles. There is at least one star puzzle that you will not be able to solve unless you have a phone that can read QR codes. I really dislike when games do this (it was a terrible idea in FEZ as well, but FEZ at least provided an alternate route, whereas TTP does not), and I could write an essay on the reasons it's an awful idea, but I'll spare you the bloviating here. The other star was the Sphinx riddle, which I didn't like because A) It takes vagueness to a whole new level, and B) The solution takes some special exceptions to the game rules the player has otherwise learned. Both of the aforementioned stars also cannot even be SEEN by the player, as they are hidden behind secret doors, so you can waste loads of time just running around pointlessly trying to figure out where they even ARE. (And not finding them, of course). Every other star in the game, however, is very visible to an observant explorer, and can be obtained with clever use of the normal game rules you have learned.\n\nAnother thing games in this genre often try to copycat is GlaDOS. Thankfully, TTP doesn't copycat here either. Instead you have Elohim, who is this really arrogant and sanctimonious dckhead that talks about how brilliant he is all the time. I turned down the voice volume to zero just because I couldn't stand him talking all the time. HOWEVER. The writing in the game is actually pretty good. You can interact with the story by reading the texts available at the computer terminals (some of which are in obvious places, some of which are hidden away in remote places). Some of the terminals also involve chats where you are asked questions. The whole point of the underlying story and these texts is that you are physically a robot but are trying to determine who you are, why you exist, why you are here. More importantly, you are trying do determine whether or not you are human, what it means to be human, why it even matters whether or not you're human, what the point of being human would be, and so on.\n\nThese "chats" you have are basically Socratic dialogues in the most literal sense. It is exactly the sort of annoying thing people used to hate Socrates for---i.e. asking you one question after another in a deliberate attempt to show you that you don't know what you're talking about. Your computerized interlocutor will present you with a philosophical question like one of those described above and then give you some multiple choice answers. This can be frustrating because it's just not good philosophy to limit the possible answers from your interlocutor this way. This is a method of "poisoning the well" as they say. BUT, while I found this frustrating at first, it turns out that the game is aware of this, is doing it intentionally, and it is somewhat plot related. There are also options available to dodge these poisoned wells and other argumentative traps for players more well-versed in philosophy and/or argument.\n\nAll in all, TTP is an extremely satisfying game that I find it very hard to say anything negative about. I give it the highest possible recommendation. Using my own scale below, I give TTP a hearty seven.\n\n7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.6) A good game that is worth the full price.\n5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.\n4) A fairly good game, but I'd recommend buying it discounted.\n3) Not great, but a few redeeming qualities. Only buy if heavily discounted.\n2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.\n1) Avoid at all costs.","January 2","true","41.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The developer showed me how to remove the cheat flag. Those guys are awesome! Totally recommend this now!\n\n-----------\n\nPlz read: I liked this game immensely, but some of the design choices have left me to not recommend.\n\nFirst off: This game is about solving puzzles. Not the Portal type. Don't even think Portal when you play this game! The logic puzzles are harder, more complex, and require an expanded view of logic. The first time you come back to solve a puzzle you spent hours attempting to beat, but gave up, then came back and had all the solutions... It's amazing! You are challenged to solve these puzzles and the answers are not always in view.\n\nSecondly: The story is really well developed. There is a lot of story and it's hidden and placed all throughout the levels and worlds you visit. It's done well, but the initial ending is sort of a bummer. Also the amount of time needed to get your first, ”Hint/Tomb” is a bit overdue. Why put the helpful hints 20 hours into the game and give you no direct guidance that you are supposed to skip puzzles as needed? IDK!\n\nIMHO: I'm a puzzler. I can't leave a puzzle until it's solved. I can't stop solving a puzzle. I HAVE to finish it. I HAVE to find a solution. Even in life, I can't leave something half done. It's either all or nothing. You see, I'm a perfectionist, and my roots run deep. I can't leave a problem until I find a solution.\n\nThat is the worst thing about this game for me. I can't walk away and take time to relieve myself of the burden of solving puzzles. They are there, they need solutions, they frustrate my intellect until they are solved. I sat up for days solving puzzles. I couldn't stop solving them. I'd be 5 hours past my normal bedtime and still not want to quit the game. Then there was the Nerve-Wrecker level...\n\nThis level ruined the game for me. Until this point, most levels were about careful planning and discovering things as you go. Nerve-Wrecker is about quickly graving objects and moving them. It's a level you would do after the main quest. I couldn't beat it. I died 4 times in a row, gave up, completed more puzzles, came back. Died 4 more times, gave up, beat the game, came back. Died 6 times in a row. I couldn't take it! “There has to be something I'm doing wrong,” I thought, ”If only I could get to the end I could see what I was missing to do to complete it.”\n\nI went to the Internet, got the code to enable cheats, enabled them, decided not to cheat, and went to sleep instead. ”I'll force myself to wait a day or two and try again...”\n\nLoad the game back up, try 6 more times, finally beat the level!!!! I'm so happy!! I hit Esc to tell my wife and I see the “Cheats” menu. “Oh yeah, better just turn that off. Didn't even need cheats.” NOPE! You can't turn them off! You can't load a prior save to before cheats and have cheats off. You can't start a new game and have cheats off. You can ask the Devs, they wanted to make enabling cheats a game ruining thing. I'm all for not allowing cheaters to get achievements, but why make it so you can never ever ever, ever ever, ever ever, play the game for any brass after you've enabled them? And why make then never ever to be unenabled? I did not even cheat! After 4 days of restless nights I had a moment of  weakness and I resisted in the end, but that will never be known, because this game has punished me for all eternity.\n\nAnd for that I can not recommend it.","July 5, 2015","true","51.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Make no mistake though, this is a 40 dollar game.\n\nIn a genre populated by small indie games, The Talos Principle is by-comparison massive, with three big worlds, extra "star" challenges, an interesting story with dialogue options and a surprising number of endings, environments that are almost shockingly huge, a really interesting hint system, and more hidden stuff than I ever found in 27 hours of playing. It's not an open-world sidequest stuffed rpg, but for its genre it has a lot. Combine this with a really interesting progression system. (Beating levels gives you puzzle pieces, you then solve the puzzles to unlock new areas and powers. You can get these pieces in any order, however.)\n\nAnd it all maintains a level of quality. This game is at least the equal of Portal, if not better than it, and anyone who enjoyed the Portal series should definitely check it out.\n\nOnly two negatives I'll mention:\n\n1: The puzzle-piece block puzzles. I solved the easy ones in 10-20 seconds. I solved the hard ones by twiddling my thumbs for 10-20 minutes and putting the blocks together until they just happened to be in the right places. In neither case did I ever get an "Aha!" moment, like I got in the game's best environmental puzzles. While it's interesting as a progression system, I feel that the puzzles would involve more rational thought if they had pictures or if you didn't just have to fill a square or rectangular prism every time. That way the player has something to go off of. And it becomes 2+2=? Instead of ?+?=4.\n\n2: The final tower level. All I'll say is that most developers use checkpoints for a reason. If you think that being bothered by repeating the same gameplay over and over is for filthy casuals, this probably won't be an issue for you.","May 19","true","27.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You're free to walk the land, explore the various puzzles, admire the flora and the architeture and generally do as you please. You must not climb the Tower, however. That is the covenant estabilished between you and your god. As you progress through the game, you'll have access to computer terminals that shed light into the purpose of the world and your own purpose. The library assistent present in the terminals, known as MLA, or Milton Library Assistent, will help you sort the information you need. He'll also be willing to engage in talks that Elohim certainly wouldn't approve, if you dare to do so. As you progress through the game and finish more and more puzzles, you'll realize there is something odd about all this. Along with the challenge from the puzzles, you'll have to be careful in what you believe and who you trust.\n\nThe gameplay is amazing. Movement is smooth, the game mechanics are fresh and the puzzles are hard as balls. There are secrets galore and several endings. There's enough here to keep you occupied and having fun for quite a while. The soundtrack is godly and sets the tone just right for the game's pace. There's plenty of narrative developments between puzzles to keep you interested in the plot and on the edge of your seat through the entire game.

But i'll go through individually to break it down.\n\nThe gameplay - This game features a first or third person perspective while you go about solving puzzles for things called "sigils", this is the core mechanic of the game, you MUST collect these to advance, which means you MUST solve the puzzles, and frankly speaking, it was very enjoyable. I found the puzzles were not overly tricky and most involve some planning ahead, but at no point was i dreading going to the next puzzle, it never got stale, so if you do puzzles then you'll enjoy this game off of that alone. HOWEVER, that is not the only thing this game is about, The Talos Principle is a philosophical adventure as well, you are continuously guided by a deep voice called "Elohim" and he openly states that he is the maintainer and creator of the world you're in and that you must go along as per his wishes to trancend to heaven; this however is met with an issue when you discover another person/entity on the computers found in every level named "Milton" or as he is referred to by Elohim "the serpent". As you progress Milton will continuously press you with really challenging and thought provoking questions and this is where this game really hooked me; i literally found myself battling with flaws in my ways of thinking, it's so mind tripping and intense and i love it. If you enjoy these things then you will also like the game.\n\nSoundtrack - The sounds in this game are really scenic and help solidify the mood of the various worlds, it will at times intensify during intermission worlds such as the A, B and C buildings and at other times mellow out such as during a few of the puzzles, it very effectively immersifies as well by simulating environments, such as birds chirping with a waterfall while playing slow deep based music to really get a calm feeling seeping into the player, i was thoroughly pleased with the use of sounds in this game, especially because you can play at your own place and i found myself just stopping and looking around nice and slowly at times to really enjoy this game.\n\nScenery/asthetics - HOLY HELL, this game was amazing with its looks; granted at times my computer would start buffering because it was on Ultra, i found that even on high i was just completely immersed and mesmerised  by the scenery; it features a realatively large closed in map in all the worlds and the look is very convincing, to the point where you go to a place where a "messenger" is and it was just beautiful, easily one of my favorite places.\n\nStory - I will not be doing any spoilers or anything; there are 3 endings, i've done 2 of them with the last one not being done being the "easiest" to accomplish (cough, basic completion); and i found myself disappointed when it ended yet completely satisfied with the endings. This games quarrels between Elohim and Milton quite apparently mirrors the "God vs Devil" kind of storyline, but rather than telling the player who is good or who is bad, we are tasked with trusting our instincts and coming to our own conclusions. Throughout the game as well, we see many QR codes which are translated into messages, these messages are from other sigil seekers, and they show the very different outlooks people may have when faced with such a situation as either scepticism or complacency. This game has a simple plot overall, of that there is no doubt, but it's the characters and interactions with the environment that make this game great.\n\nI've left this segment seperate, but this is also part of the story; You will find audio files, these files depict one Alexander Drennan, a person who shares her thoughts on the outlook of the world, human beings, and our creations. She touches on some deep and maybe depressing topics, but she does so effectively, she very much is, in my opinion, one of the most immersive and enjoyable aspects of the game, the voice actor Erin Fitzgerald did an amazing job voicing her and we learn the means that built up to The Talos Principle; i will not diverge into it, as i think that's part of the enjoyment and what builds a drive to find all the files and information.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n- There are things in the game called stars, they are what they sound like; golden stars. These things are hidden in almost every level of every Hub world (7*3) There are 30 in total, 3 are found in the Main transistional world where the tower lays. THESE THINGS ARE ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T, I'm not even joking, had i not looked up a tutorial to find them all, i would never have found them, you have to do the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t things, interact multiple puzzles with each other, find hidden passages, ladders and switches and frankly, it's just tedious. Through the stars you unlock 3 worlds, these worlds have 9 sigils in total that are needed for the secret ending; I very much dislike how ♥♥♥♥ing hidden and annoying they are, i didn't even know there were so many stars needed until about halfway through. Honestly a drag, you WILL need a guide for this.\n\n- It's a bit short a game; if you're only here for puzzles, then you will have such a short playthrough; the only reason i have 20 hours on record is due to doing everything with the exception of a few acheivements; this by no means stops it from being a great game, it really is, i would buy this full price, just be wary that if you truly want to draw everythign out of the game, take it slow, otherwise you will probably be disappointed.\n\nOf all of the games i've enjoyed, this game is damn near the top, I give it a 9/10 easy, i look forward to the DLC when i can afford it.\n\n\n****EDIT****\n\nI've just completed the DLC Road to Gehenna, it is beautiful in its own way, it has the same atmosphere as the vanilla game, and obviously still has puzzles and <♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t> stars, but it also touches on a more existenal take, seeing many characters trapped in Elohim's prison. Going through all the messages on the boards, reading what they have and the community they've built, it really does show how society can really becomes this entangled mess. I wouldn't say it had the same impact as the vanilla, which i believe is due to the lack of voice over, (erin fitzgerald truley made the game a massive experience for me), and it definitely didn't touch much on the same existenal crisis that the vanilla did in my opinion.\n\nIt was by no means disappointing, but if i hadn't have been so invested into the story of the vanilla, that i got all the endings (but the basic) then i don't think the DLC at full price (i got it during discount) would have been worth it in my opinion. I think the vanilla is the main meat of it, and the DLC wraps it in a nice little bow. Overall this game is phenomenal and i cannot stress that it will forever have a place in my heart and recommendation list.","January 11","true","29.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

There is nothing here we haven't seen before in slightly different shapes. You press buttons, push boxes, divert lasers, interact with copies of yourself etc. You know the drill, if there were a book puzzle 101 for videogames, it would contain most of these mechanics. If you are looking for something new look elsewhere. If you just like puzzles, like me, then do play this game! The puzzles are very well designed and will keep you entertained for several hours. There isn't much more to do other than solving puzzles though, so it's the kind of game that is best played in short sessions. Sit down, solve a couple of rooms, come back later.\n\nThere is some story going on. And I liked it! It's exposed mainly through computer terminals you find scattered throughout the world. You can read files left by unknown people and you can have conversations with an unknown entity. In my opinion the whole philosophical debate happening is underwhelming, predictable and boring. The game seems to presume it is blowing your mind but it just comes out as that facebook friend who says things like "wake up sheeple!" to warn you about the dangers of capitalism. It touches things like what it is to be human, morality, consciousness etc, all under a thin veil of religion. Still, when it comes to videogames Talos Principle's philosophical debate is not that bad. It's eons ahead Deus Ex: Human revolution, for example. But, reiterating, I did enjoy the story, it's an interesting idea.\n\nWhat else can I say? It looks gorgeous! it has nice soothing music that goes well with puzzle solving.

If you liked (or disliked) Portal, it's that type of game, and a very good one.\n\nBut what makes The Talos Principle stand out is it's special story, and I just won't talk about that more than to say a passing interest in philosophy is a benefit to like the story.

Actually, I would hesitate to call it a game, this is an experience on par with the best books. Big words I know, but I am simply blown away by the Talos Principle.\nThe idea behind the game is pretty simple: solve puzzles to collect tetraminos, which you can use to unlock more puzzles and advance. It has a lot in common with Portal.\nWhat makes it far superior to Portal, however, is the story that evolves as you solve puzzles. Scattered about the world (or worlds, rather), are computer terminals with fragments of texts, many by real worlds authors. They range in time from the Book of the Dead from ancient Egypt, to philosophy by Immanuel Kant etc. These texts paint a picture of how conscience and our place in the world is, and has been, understood, and prepare you for some indepth philosophical discussions later in the game. I won't spoil anything more, though, but just say that an interest in philosophy is very helpful (but absolutely not required!).\nMoving to the more technical aspects of the game, the graphics are gorgeous though not perfect, though the music is nigh perfect in my opinion: very relaxing and setting the mood for patient exploring and puzzle solving. In general, the game plays very relaxed, there are only a few points in the game where you need to hurry in order to solve a puzzle.\n\n\nThe only negative points are that a very few puzzles were a little too frustrating (Egyptian Arcade and Nerve-wrecker - apt name!), and that the end-puzzle could have had a couple in-between saves.\n\n\nAll in all, I HIGHLY recommend this game. If you only play one game this year, do yourself a favour and let it be the Talos Principle. It is THAT good. It has made me interested in philosophy and the theory of consciousness, and I have already bought a few books about it. Playing this game was time VERY WELL spent, and I look forward to playing it again some time, and hopefully to seeing more such games from Croteam and the writers Tom Jubert and Jonas Kyratzes, who have done and incredible job!\n\nAnother thing, this may be a more adult (not in that sense! ;) ) game, I'm not sure if kids or teenagers would enjoy it as much.","January 5, 2015","true","73.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Actually felt a lot longer. Overall, I'd give it a recommendation if you think you could dig a little philosophical history mixed in with your puzzle action.\n\n"About 20 hours" was arrived at after completing all of the official green, yellow, and red sigil puzzles on my own, and then following a guide to pick up the roughly half of the star sigils that I'd missed, as well as following a guide for the giant tower's puzzles. I cleared the "messenger" puzzles on my own, but I still haven't cleared the grey sigil puzzles. By volume, I'd say I solved 70% of the content on my own, followed a guide for 15%, and have another 15% to come back for.\n\nThe Talos Principle places you in the role of an artificial intelligence that has been placed in a world filled with puzzles. You're challenged to solve all the puzzles, with the promise of eternal life as a reward for successfully doing so. As you explore, the game exposes you to a variety of western philosophical ideas and ultimately gives you a brief primer on the history and development of western philosophy, more-or-less starting with the titular Talos Principle: that it does not matter what the philosopher believes, they cannot survive without their blood (a materialist argument). Along the way, the game also challenges the player to argue their own philosophical outlook, albeit from a prepared list of common ideas, and sadly even the "expanded" list of options is painfully lacking in nuance. That's the risk of asking someone what they believe.\n\nAs for the puzzles, I found them to be pretty enjoyable and well-balanced. The color-coded difficulty rating was pretty spot-on. The tools were varied and techniques for using them were applied very creatively. The puzzles rarely fell prey to irreversible mistakes, as well, which I found most pleasantly surprising; I appreciate how difficult that is to do, and there were very few puzzles I felt I needed to reset due to a mistake. The puzzles also seemed very resilient to cheating and exploitation. That means most of the puzzles have effectively one solution, but the "A ha!" moment from figuring them out is delightful.\n\nIn a few exceptional cases I felt like the "puzzle verbs" were unintuitive, and I only discovered them by accident or by following a guide to one of the star sigils. One generally does not think to balance a box on a sphere, for instance. I also developed a specific hate-boner for the hovering mines, but I feel that's a matter of personal preference, as I found them to be extremely nerve-wracking (there's even a mine-based puzzle in the game named "Nerve-Wracking").\n\nIn conclusion, this was a much better game than the highly-pretentious name and title art suggested, and now that I've completed the "quick and dirty" ending as well as the "true" ending, I plan to take my time finishing the grey sigil puzzles to get the "bonus on the side" ending.","January 31, 2015","true","20.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I want to explore every inch of the world, read every text entry, search for every hidden star and easter eggs (there so many!). The story hinges on philosophy and self-purpose and to say anything else would spoil how great it is.\n\nI'm a huge fan of puzzle game as well but even Portal, the most charming puzzle game imaginable, didn't captivate me like the puzzles in TTP. I'm eager to solve every one and the puzzles themselves as well as the progression of mechanics and difficulty curve is absolutely perfect.\n\nThe world of TTP is so damn interesting!! Filled to the brim with personality. Messages of others left behind that are actually intresting to read as well as a mysterious computer terminal... All with a voice in the sky, Elohim, guiding you as if he were some god. To say things are more than they appear is a criminal understatement but if you liked the atmosphere of the exterior of the test chambers in Portal 2 (The rooms hidden behind walls, messages constantly having you consider where and what you are) you will LOVE TTP\n\n$40. It's steep even with all this praise. If you're someone who looks for playtime you'll get from what I can tell and what I've heard ~20 hours if you want to explore.

What can I say that would describe the elating, sorrowful, thought-provoking experience that is this game? The Talos Principle is simply a work of art; it can only be described masterful exploration of what it means to be a person, to be human. And yet, it never tells us quite what makes one so.\n\nIt can showcase a brilliant adventure by one who would seek the truth whilst forsaking immortalisation, or the epic saga of one who would seek eternity without knowing the truth of their reality, or if it even is reality. It shows that devotion and faith can deliver one to their goal, but at the same time that perseverance and a desire to learn rather than blindly believe can take you to places untold.\n\nAnd throughout, you're never wrong to follow your own path, because what is humanity but living the life you feel is best, seeking to satisfy the values you hold dear? You may follow your own path or the one given to you, but no matter which you choose...\n\nIt's your choice and only you can make it.\n\nThe Path to the Sigils,\nand to Enlightenment and Eternity\n\nThe puzzles in this game are beyond what you'll find in a less philosophical title. I don't say that to insult other titles. I, for one, love games like Portal, which are driven by their stories. And that doesn't make their puzzles any less difficult.\n\nWhat I mean is that, simply put, the puzzles found in The Talos Principle are not simply solved in one way or another. They can be solved in any way you may find. You may see a way to take a piece out of a puzzle, drag it somewhere else, and solve another puzzle with its external assistance. You may guide a simple beam across several puzzles at once. You might even find that some things are only able to be found when you look closely at what you're given and disregard the boundaries they're seemingly trapped within.\n\nThis game gives you a sort of freedom that is only found when one is forced to question the very foundations upon which their world is wrought. The world may be hewn from the Hidden Words, designed so as to ensure your ability to reach all of the conclusions by following its guidance. But that doesn't mean that you must follow the path. In fact, some things may actually be far easier if you ignore the world as it is, and instead view it as you wish it to be. After all, your will can move mountains and defy the very pitfalls that consume the path before you.\n\nYou must simply find something to believe in, whether that be a god to help and guide you, or your own power to shape and completely rewrite the world in your image.\n\nA Story Written Long Ago,\nNow Viewed Through Another Lens\n\nThe world is not simply defined by the story it shows on its surface. The lore set out by the terminal entries, the time capsule recordings, the characters within the world itself...even the QR codes haphazardly spread on the walls by those before, after, and alongside you show that no way of thinking is correct, but that none of them are wrong. Only by your own mind may you find the truth as it applies to you, but that doesn't mean you should ignore the help and advice offered to you.\n\nThe story set about before the game is tragic, but beautiful. It is explained across the worlds you trek through, and shows that the pride of humankind both curses it to tragedies and yet bestows upon it the gifts of thaumaturgy. Never have I seen such beauty in failures when they serve to teach, nor felt such disgust in the successes that enable destruction.\n\nThe characters you meet and those you don't will both share viewpoints and antagonise each other, just as occurs in the world now. They will present, to you and others, their viewpoints and it's up to you to interpret them and use them to build your own views, or to discard in favour of your views.\n\nThis is a game that encourages you to think, not just about the puzzles it places before you, but about everything that it is to exist, to feel, to be a person. It both terrifies and calms, and consistently shows that while your beliefs will serve you, they should never be allowed to become prejudices that serve only to hinder you.\n\nYou must view the world with a curious and welcoming heart, but also with a hesitant and questioning mind.\n\nYet, Thou Shall, Without Fail, Find\nThyself Cursed With One Thousand Sigils\n\nThis is actually the only part of the game that I can say I disliked, and not even that consistently. I understand that not everything can be perfect and not everything will please everyone, but after painfully trudging through Sigils of Elohim for extra content in The Talos Principle, and the tetromino puzzles within this game itself, I find myself thoroughly fed up with tetrominos. And that's saying something, since I love tetris, but I can find no love for these any longer.\n\nAnd So Shall It Be, Just As It Is\nWritten By The Hidden Words\nMy judgments on the game's core components are as follows:\n\nComponent Being Judged        Score (out of 10)                Environment Design        10/10                World Puzzles        10/10                Backstory Elements        10/10                Characters and Storyline        10/10                Tetromino Puzzles        7/10\nAnd yet, even with the blasted tetrominos, I'm gonna give the game a solid 10/10 because this game goes absolutely above any beyond what I could have ever begun to expect was possible in a game. If ever I considered anything to be a work of art in gaming, this would be something I would stick in the Louvre as the primary example of what artistic beauty can be fashioned within the framework that is a videogame.\n\nAnd that it was done with the engine and some great many assets from something as silly as Serious Sam 3 (also a fantastic game, for wildly different reasons) is absolutely magnificent.\n\nCongratulations, Tom Jubert and Jonas Kyratzes. Your story has brought me to tears, had me smiling with some of the most genuine happiness I've ever known, and shown me that nothing can be taken for granted. And congratulations to Croteam and Devolver Digital for developing and publishing this absolutely masterful piece of human history. This will go down as a thing of beauty and will be remembered for many years to come.\n\nThank you so very much for creating this game and allowing me to experience this world, for I am truly grateful to have been able to be a part of it.\n\n(Note: I have not played with the Serious DLC. I can only imagine it's far less serious than the name implies. Otherwise, I have seen every facet of this world's beauty, and found nothing wanting. It is a truly masterful work and sets the example for those that would come after it.)","December 28, 2015","true","81.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The Talos Principle is truly memorable for me, and I didn't expect that from a puzzle game! There is so much to say about it, yet there is so much to be seen and appreciate with your very own eyes. It all starts with you awaking into a mysterious garden. You're confused on what's going on and suddenly, a voice from above is speaking to you. He presents himself as Elohim, you are his child and he will guide you to a road of eternal life. Along the way you will find computer terminals, sometimes granting network access, allowing you to talk to a program called Milton. Elohim calls him "a snake", whilst Milton says the opposite is "a liar". This program makes you have a conversation with him, letting you feel you are not alone... or are you? Returning to Elohim: for him to grant you eternal life, you must collect his sigils(which in reality those are rejected Tetris blocks) that are scattered through different worlds and puzzles. Speaking of puzzles, they are usually compared to the ones of Portal 2. Because you know, Portal 2 is the only puzzle game in the world, AIN'T IT? However, I can say that these mind-buggling games are truly astonishing and creatively designed. And we're talking about Croteam, the guys that made Serious Sam, a game about a guy blowing ♥♥♥♥ up by just looking at it. *sigh* Anywho, I said something about worlds. An all about 3 lands+a tower, in which you have to find more about them yourself, but all I can say is, and that should summerize the game too: " You know you are not in the real world, you know everything around you is a glitchy simulation program and you DO know there is almost no one to trust. But, you can't help but just... admire the view. Just believe in yourself and your own forces and everything will turn just fine. And trust whoever you think deserves it. " Yeah, that sounded much better in my head, but you get the point. The Talos Principle is a game I consider everyone from now on needs to have it in his/her library, as well as I hope in the near future it will become a nostalgic game everyone will look back on it and smile. The final verdict for this game is a 10/10 for me, a must have. This has been one guy's review, the verdict and choice is at your will.\nP.S.

This game is better than Portal.\n\nIn the Talos Principle, you are a robot. Literally anything further than that is a unknown to you. Your goal is to solve puzzles using objects scattered around the world, use the "sigils" (tetronimos) you gain from beating these in block puzzles to unlock new things, and ultimately solve every last puzzle across the land.\n\nBut things are more complicated than that. There are glitches in the code, a terminal tells you. Things aren't as they seem. But how does the terminal know? Who is to say that the terminal is right and the omniescent voice telling you what to do is wrong? Are you even a robot? Could you be human all this time? What even defines a human?\n\nThe Talos Principle is a puzzle game that combines traditional 1st person puzzle solving with ridiculously in depth philosophy and stunning graphics. A careful balance between the gameplay though, as whenever you seem to grow tired of philosophy or solving endless puzzles you can always find something else to do, like find the hidden stars across the land (which I should mention are ballbustingly cryptic, this is CROTEAM we're talking about) or explore for more terminals and hidden lore. The Puzzles themselves are a mix between "I beat it in 10 seconds" and "♥♥♥♥ it, i'm looking up a walkthrough" and are extremely copious in amount as you explore the world further. I never felt like I was doing the same stuff over and over again in the puzzles, which was surprising due to the sheer amount of them in the game.\n\nThe story is revealed to you through terminals as you beat puzzles, and sometimes Elohim (a voice in the sky) will pipe in as well. The "story" is more philisophical debate than actual plot, and for that reason I wouldn't recommend the game to people who aren't interested in philosophy (but if you're not sure, go for it- this is a great way to get into it). It's also a lot of reading as the story comes through chat logs, emails, and an archive of old libraries.\n\nDespite all this, there are some shortcomings, although few and far between. There are some puzzles that are more "action" oriented, and while most are fine there are some that add unnecessary frustration and pain due to their out of place nature (whoever designed "Egyptian Arcade" needs to be banned from making puzzle games). There are also multiple endings, and while I haven't gotten to them all yet I'm assuming based on how the story unfolded that I'm going to have to make multiple saves for it which is a huge pain.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend The Talos Principle. At 15 dollars (current price, on sale) it's an absolute steal. Even higher than that it's worth it. At 40 dollars I'd still say it's abosolutely worth the money, but be weary if you're not into philosophy at that price because reading tons of text and debating with a computer is about half the game.\n\n9.5/10","June 17, 2015","true","16.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I haven't finished the game - normally, I dislike reviews of unfinished games, but I'm going on a trip for the weekend and I feel the need to put some words here.\n\nThis game makes me feel so happy! It's an experience the likes I haven't had in so many years I almost forgot it's possible. An intertwining of chilling music, sunlit neoclassical landscapes and a narrative about the timeless dilemma - what is artificial and what is human. A relevant topic I'd say in these years when we study AI and automatic learning at the university.\n\nBeyond the story which is nicely revealed in epistolary form (on laptops in the middle of ruined statues), the mechanics of Talos Principle entrance me. I'm not sure how to convey them, but I'll offer this clumsy analogy: suppose I leave you inside a huge and intricate building, I give you a simple tool - a hammer - and tell you to find secrets. I show you how to hammer nails and maybe how to pry them out. Then you start hammering around and solving problems inside the house.\n\nAfter a while you can't find much more. But then, you take a small mental leap and realise you can break stuff with the hammer. You start breaking flimsy doors and windows and finding so much more to explore. Then you start getting stuck again. You take this hammer and you start throwing it at things. New openings appear!\n\nYou realise that this simple tool, this hammer, is more than just a means to nail things down. It sinks, it has mass, volume, a wooden end. You use it to prop doors open, to grip things beyond your reach, to break things beyond fences, as a paperweight. I only gave you a hammer and that's all you have, so you must make use of it in evey way you can. What if I give you a chisel now?\n\nIn this, the game resembles Portal: simple mechanics explored to their surprising depths, and which the game introduces through clever situations instead of just giving you a tutorial on the properties of objects. It gives you the pleasure of discovering an unexpected angle of looking at things.\n\nIn the end, I can simply spend hours wandering this gorgeous, bittersweet world. The artstyle is the very definition of a screenshot simulator. I'll write more about the story when I finish the game.","April 29, 2015","true","23.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

One of these that you complete and you sit back and think "i just witnessed/played something great, something rare".\nIn the core it has amazing addictive puzzles that will make you scratch your head but not frustrate you (too much, its kinda hard at the end). But what really makes this game shine, the cherry at the top, is the story.\nNo cutscenes, you are a silent protagonist so you dont speak, just texts to read, a voice that guides you and some interaction with some computer. Thats was enough for me be to be captured in one of the most interesting stories in videogames. This game will make you think. You will read, and then you will explore the world, you will listen and then you will think, even after you stop playing.\nIt will serve you a really interesting story, a mystery to solve, and will make you really think about what you really are.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GamingVirtue/recommended/257510/","GamingVirtue","Prototype: Virtue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GamingVirtue/","456 products in account","The Talos Principle - Beauty in All Forms:\nPhysical, Mental, and Spiritual\nThe World, Rendered By\nThe Hidden Words\nWhat do I even say about this? What can I say that would describe the elating, sorrowful, thought-provoking experience that is this game? The Talos Principle is simply a work of art; it can only be described masterful exploration of what it means to be a person, to be human. And yet, it never tells us quite what makes one so.\n\nIt can showcase a brilliant adventure by one who would seek the truth whilst forsaking immortalisation, or the epic saga of one who would seek eternity without knowing the truth of their reality, or if it even is reality. It shows that devotion and faith can deliver one to their goal, but at the same time that perseverance and a desire to learn rather than blindly believe can take you to places untold.\n\nAnd throughout, you're never wrong to follow your own path, because what is humanity but living the life you feel is best, seeking to satisfy the values you hold dear? You may follow your own path or the one given to you, but no matter which you choose...\n\nIt's your choice and only you can make it.\n\nThe Path to the Sigils,\nand to Enlightenment and Eternity\n\nThe puzzles in this game are beyond what you'll find in a less philosophical title. I don't say that to insult other titles. I, for one, love games like Portal, which are driven by their stories. And that doesn't make their puzzles any less difficult.\n\nWhat I mean is that, simply put, the puzzles found in The Talos Principle are not simply solved in one way or another. They can be solved in any way you may find. You may see a way to take a piece out of a puzzle, drag it somewhere else, and solve another puzzle with its external assistance. You may guide a simple beam across several puzzles at once. You might even find that some things are only able to be found when you look closely at what you're given and disregard the boundaries they're seemingly trapped within.\n\nThis game gives you a sort of freedom that is only found when one is forced to question the very foundations upon which their world is wrought. The world may be hewn from the Hidden Words, designed so as to ensure your ability to reach all of the conclusions by following its guidance. But that doesn't mean that you must follow the path. In fact, some things may actually be far easier if you ignore the world as it is, and instead view it as you wish it to be. After all, your will can move mountains and defy the very pitfalls that consume the path before you.\n\nYou must simply find something to believe in, whether that be a god to help and guide you, or your own power to shape and completely rewrite the world in your image.\n\nA Story Written Long Ago,\nNow Viewed Through Another Lens\n\nThe world is not simply defined by the story it shows on its surface. The lore set out by the terminal entries, the time capsule recordings, the characters within the world itself...even the QR codes haphazardly spread on the walls by those before, after, and alongside you show that no way of thinking is correct, but that none of them are wrong. Only by your own mind may you find the truth as it applies to you, but that doesn't mean you should ignore the help and advice offered to you.\n\nThe story set about before the game is tragic, but beautiful. It is explained across the worlds you trek through, and shows that the pride of humankind both curses it to tragedies and yet bestows upon it the gifts of thaumaturgy. Never have I seen such beauty in failures when they serve to teach, nor felt such disgust in the successes that enable destruction.\n\nThe characters you meet and those you don't will both share viewpoints and antagonise each other, just as occurs in the world now. They will present, to you and others, their viewpoints and it's up to you to interpret them and use them to build your own views, or to discard in favour of your views.\n\nThis is a game that encourages you to think, not just about the puzzles it places before you, but about everything that it is to exist, to feel, to be a person. It both terrifies and calms, and consistently shows that while your beliefs will serve you, they should never be allowed to become prejudices that serve only to hinder you.\n\nYou must view the world with a curious and welcoming heart, but also with a hesitant and questioning mind.\n\nYet, Thou Shall, Without Fail, Find\nThyself Cursed With One Thousand Sigils\n\nThis is actually the only part of the game that I can say I disliked, and not even that consistently. I understand that not everything can be perfect and not everything will please everyone, but after painfully trudging through Sigils of Elohim for extra content in The Talos Principle, and the tetromino puzzles within this game itself, I find myself thoroughly fed up with tetrominos. And that's saying something, since I love tetris, but I can find no love for these any longer.\n\nAnd So Shall It Be, Just As It Is\nWritten By The Hidden Words\nMy judgments on the game's core components are as follows:\n\nComponent Being Judged        Score (out of 10)                Environment Design        10/10                World Puzzles        10/10                Backstory Elements        10/10                Characters and Storyline        10/10                Tetromino Puzzles        7/10\nAnd yet, even with the blasted tetrominos, I'm gonna give the game a solid 10/10 because this game goes absolutely above any beyond what I could have ever begun to expect was possible in a game. If ever I considered anything to be a work of art in gaming, this would be something I would stick in the Louvre as the primary example of what artistic beauty can be fashioned within the framework that is a videogame.\n\nAnd that it was done with the engine and some great many assets from something as silly as Serious Sam 3 (also a fantastic game, for wildly different reasons) is absolutely magnificent.\n\nCongratulations, Tom Jubert and Jonas Kyratzes. Your story has brought me to tears, had me smiling with some of the most genuine happiness I've ever known, and shown me that nothing can be taken for granted. And congratulations to Croteam and Devolver Digital for developing and publishing this absolutely masterful piece of human history. This will go down as a thing of beauty and will be remembered for many years to come.\n\nThank you so very much for creating this game and allowing me to experience this world, for I am truly grateful to have been able to be a part of it.\n\n(Note: I have not played with the Serious DLC. I can only imagine it's far less serious than the name implies. Otherwise, I have seen every facet of this world's beauty, and found nothing wanting. It is a truly masterful work and sets the example for those that would come after it.)","December 28, 2015","true","81.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The gameplay is non-linear - you feel stuck with one puzzle - go and solve another one!

'what happend to mankind? what is it all about, what is the purpose of solving this puzzles? what am I?'. Conversations with Milton (...a computer program? or not?)

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadikka/recommended/257510/","shadikka","Shadikka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadikka/","345 products in account","In a nutshell\nChallenging, but mostly not frustrating puzzles\nStunning atmosphere, beautiful graphics and an excellent soundtrack\nA well-presented, if not the most novel background story\nAround 25 hours to complete (see below)\nWell worth the full price, absolutely worth it on sale\nGameplay\nTalos Principle is a first-person [1] puzzler, which draws a lot of comparisons to Portal. However, whereas the Portal series is full of kinetic puzzles where the motion of your character matters, Talos Principle requires very little platforming skills. For example, if you need to jump on an object such as a cube, the game gives you a prompt for that and essentially makes a guided jump. In essence, you can approach Talos Principle purely as a puzzle game that does not require you to have played any first-person games ever before.\n\nThe puzzles in the game are located in open worlds, which can be accessed via three hubs in the main world. Each hub has portals to seven different worlds, for a grand total of 21 worlds with three to seven puzzles each - plus a few outside the worlds, mostly bonus and ending content. Hubs B and C are gated via sigils, which are acquired by completing the puzzles. In addition, all five main gameplay elements need to be unlocked via their own sigils before completing puzzles with them.\n\nIf you play through the levels in order, the difficulty with each gameplay element progresses well. You will first encounter a small tutorial-like puzzle, before later on having to think outside the box for trickier uses of the elements. [2] Overall the difficulty is high enough to entertain, but luckily free of frustration. The game does include an in-game hint system, but unlocking even a single hint is fairly laborious and the hints themselves are often obtuse. It is possible to get stuck on a few levels, mostly in the later parts of the game, but most of the time you cannot fail so badly that you need to restart, unless you blow up a mine. (Which is why the mines are the worst part of the game in my opinion.)\n\nAchievements and bonus content\nThe base game includes 36 achievements. Some achievements [3] are technically mutually exclusive with each other on a single playthrough, but with a guide and some planning you can achieve them on a single playthrough by reloading from checkpoints. For the most part, the achievements are not given too easily.\n\nThe game has three different endings, but your saved checkpoints are not removed before finishing the game, so you do not need to be afraid of needing to play the game through three times. The hardest ending requires finishing all puzzles in the game, including bonus levels, which have some of the hardest puzzles in the game.\n\nIn addition to these, the game has numerous easter eggs, ranging from game references to photos of the development team. The easter eggs are usually easily reachable if you know where they are, but are pretty hard to find.\n\nGraphics and audio\nThe game is gorgeous, both visually and aurally. The graphics are detailed and especially the lighting is stunning, even though bloom is overused. Landscapes in the game range from arctic tundra to a lush boreal forest and are always beautiful. Despite the detailed look of the game, the graphics rarely come in the way of the actual gameplay, so you will never need to aim a beam through foliage, for example.\n\nThe soundtrack of the game is mostly orchestral and majestic and sets the atmosphere of the game very well. The tracks are short, sadly, and might start to get on your nerves after a while. The pieces vary from typical church-like epics with a pipe organ and a male choir to vaguely Celtic with a harp-like lead in a pentatonic scale, with mostly acoustic or acoustic-like sounds and no really discernable lyrics.\n\nThe voice lines in the game are mostly by Elohim, the game's voice in the sky. The voice actor of Elohim, Timothy Watson, does an excellent job. As befitting a divine character, his voice is deep and somehow sounds large and makes you shiver, no matter whether Elohim is currently loving, angry or proud.\n\nThe other character with voiced lines is one of the sources of the backstory. Erin Fitzgerald brings out the character really well and manages to convey emotions very strongly via only her voice, as is crucial for a character that the player should feel invested in, but is ever only heard, not seen on-screen.\n\nStoryline\nSmall spoilers ahead.\n\nThe premise of the game is that you are an artificial intelligence inhabiting a robotic body in what seems like a computer simulation, guided by a divine voice from above who calls himself Elohim. The game does not go out of its way to tell you anything about the storyline, and you could very well finish all the puzzles and the whole game without really knowing anything about the backstory or the actual plot - if you are decidedly not curious about your surroundings.\n\nThe story is told via bits and pieces by computer terminals that seem out of place in the environments, shining time capsules that contain audio logs by the only voiced human in the game, and messages on the walls, which are either story-relevant messages by characters that are implied to be related to you, or are from a set of predefined messages painted on the walls by your Steam friends.\n\nPersonally I have always liked stories that are revealed slowly, part by part, and Talos Principle was no exception. The fate of the human world is told with very creative ways via very different types of messages, and the world you are in gets painted in a very different light depending on who you want to believe.\n\nA big point of the game is philosophy, and especially te philosophy of existence and cognition are discussed in the game, both actively via dialogue and by the backstory tidbits. While the subject matter is not the rarest one around even in video games, I found it presented very enjoyably. Approach it with an opem mind, and you will hopefully enjoy it.\n\nSummary\nI really like the game. The gameplay is enjoyable and challenging, and the atmosphere brought by the soundtrack and the backstory is pure escapist bliss for me. Talos Principle is not a very light game to play, but if you are in a suitable mood and approach the philosophical parts of the game with an open mind, it is a more enjoyable experience than most. At least it was for me.\n\n[1] Third-person is an option as well.\n[2] And trust me, there will be a trickier use for every single thing in the game. Even the boxes!\n[3] Namely, the groups are: The three endings, use / non-use of the in-game hints, and three plot choices that are mostly unrelated to the actual endings. One achievement is dependent on both a plot choice and an ending choice.","January 24","true","43.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I've played The Sea Will Claim Everything, A Postcard from Afthonia, and others, designed and written by Jonas, which I enjoyed immensely. Without revealing too much, one of the ideas that The Talos Principle explores is what it means to be human. Jonas and Tom (the other co-writer) both did a fantastic job.\n\nI was surprised when I first heard that Croteam was developing a philosophical first-person puzzler. I played Serious Sam 1 & 2 when I was much younger, and this seemed like a completely different direction for them. I don't really have any complaints about the gameplay; the controls are tight and the puzzles are challenging but rewarding and generally don't rely on precise placement of objects or quick movements. The level design is fantastic and varied, and the game runs incredibly well on my aging computer. Also, it's a fairly long game.\n\nThe Talos Principle always left me wanting to know more about what would happen next.\n\nIt's easily my favorite game of 2014.","January 1, 2015","true","33.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Awesome balancement less than 5 puzzles were problematic for me (out of 100 or so).\nThe story is really interesting, the games poses many philosophical questions during the terminal sections and the whole and the setting is well depicted. Maybe presenting these topics in terminal sessions that are separated by several dozens minutes of puzzle solving isn't the best way to keep track of them but you don't require them to enjoy the plot or the game.\nIf you loved Portal 2 buy the games asap, the puzzles are much better and the story/setting are as cool as Aperture Sciene but not as easy to follow.","September 18, 2015","true","16.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

You get pieces of backstory through old computer archives, bit by bit, and when the story finally clicks in your head, it's a pretty amazing and emotional moment.\n\nWith the time I spent on the game, and the enjoyment and criitical thinking I put my brain through, I definitely think it was worth the $40 for me. That's not to say that I don't think it should be priced lower. $40 is the most I've spent on a game in all of 2014, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nIt's been a week since I fiinished the game, and the only con that I can think of is that you can't see your feet when you look down in first person mode, nor do your arms act like they do when you are in third person mode (press H while you're running around with something in your hand(s) and compare first/third to see what I'm talking about).\n\nFinal Score: 9/10\n\nWill I play again: 100%, yes.","December 31, 2014","true","41.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I recommend this whole heartedly to all puzzle fans, it has a lot of unique puzzles with a very gentle difficulty curve but a decent amount of tough puzzles in the 2nd half of the game to give even the best lateral thinkers something to really get their teeth into. It's accompanied by absolutely fantastic visuals, if you can max out this game is looks beautiful in places, it also comes with a really great soundtrack that doesn't distract from puzzle solving and adds great ambiance. The game features an intruiging story which is drip fed through a series of emails and archived electronic messages and ultimately opens up an interactive discussion on life, death, purpose, free will, what it means to be human and many other similar topics which add together to form a cohesive over arching and masterfully crafted plot. There's multiple endings depending on what degree you venture into the depths of the game and there's a huge number of secret collectibles which open up secret and unique puzzle areas which ultimately lead to unique endings, but there's also many other irrelevant easter eggs and references to other games which reward exploration and an inquisitive nature.\n\nMy 100% playthrough with relatively little getting stuck clocks in at 26 hours, this is 120 puzzles 30 hidden stars and many other easter eggs, value for money cannot be greater here.\n\nIf you are a puzzle fan and you enjoyed the portal games but ultimately found them lacking in depth and length especially relative to the price then you should absolutely buy this game. This is easily the sleeper hit of 2014 and easily my GOTY.

The main puzzles are just challenging enough to make you border on frustration, but leave you very satisfied once you've completed them.

It took me about 18 hours to complete the game with all endings unlocked, so it will definitely last quite a while.","March 12, 2015","true","18.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Writing and plot are witty, thought provoking, and paced excellently. Settings and music are ♥♥♥♥ing gorgeous. Puzzles are fun, though the difficulty curve is a little on the easy side besides a few of the puzzles which are straight up nonsense, but at the end of the day they're clever and interesting (and they make you feel clever for solving them), and the ambiance make some of the things that I usually find irritating in puzzlers not so bad (i.e. its so pleasant I don't mind having to retry a puzzle many times).\n\nDefinitely worth full price for ~20 hours for one playthrough.","March 9, 2015","true","21.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A combination puzzler, philosophical debate, and bit of a mystery. It has been compared to Portal for the puzzle-solving part, but unlike Portal it doesn’t get stupidly difficult to find the solution. It doesn’t get too long and the pacing is perfect.\n\nThe story-line is awesome – like reading a good book. Each step of the way you learn a bit more about the purpose and about the past. The graphics, environment, and music is art.\n\nThe game-play doesn’t rely of over-the-top hand-eye coordination or speed. In fact, for many levels, if you try the speed approach it will only frustrate you.\n\nThere are actually three endings, depending on what you find and the choices you make. And yes, you can always restore a backup once you complete one ending.\n\nMy advice is to look everywhere and try to break the “rules” of the game. There is so much to find and see that you will discover that everything that is not part of the normal landscape is there on purpose.\n","March 15, 2015","true","35.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I feel that it's more like The Swapper simply because the story relates. In The Talos Principle, you'll use a variety of devices to solve puzzles in a first-person perspective (or even third person). I found many of the puzzles easy and some of them difficult; the game definitely gets your brain working. For some of the more difficult puzzles, consider looking at the guides available on Steam since they may have a number of hints available instead of just outright telling you the answer (which is no fun). Some of the puzzles may be randomly generated, so don't count on being able to get a free pass for those.\n\nDon't be lazy, go for all of the stars and tetromino, obviously that's how to get the best ending. Admittedly, I didn't read most of the documents obtained throughout the game, what I did skim or actually read gave me a good idea of what had happened and why I was there and the ending only confirmed my suspicions from what I had gathered from the texts in the game. Also consider that more secrets may appear after you clear an area.\n\nIt took me 35 hours to complete the game. I do still have some achievements to get but in that time I gathered all stars and tetromino.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like was that some of the water falls were too loud and didn't pan around in the speakers based on the listener's location in relation to the water falls. :)","March 17, 2015","true","58.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Game contains solid variety of puzzles, collectables, solutions of every problem, some very interesting interactions with enviroment when you are not nin the puzzle section and also relly good idea how to "communicate" across the players who can leave you messages, very similar to mechanic used in dark souls or more like souls series in general.\n\nIn summary:\npros: + If you like long games, challenging puzzles, collectables in the open world, awesome story with different endings, than this game is for you more than absolutely anything right now.\n\nCons: - Some endings could have better cutscene, animation of character movement from 3rd person is just bad, that is shame, graphics is not bad in general, first impression is more like very good, but when you play this game for an hours you will realise that some desins of object in cheap and not detailed as it should be in 2014.\n\nFinal verdict: Its totally 10/10 in logic game genre, it shines with content in every way as feeling that you have never played something like this before. Well done Croteam, now I am waiting what more you will bring to the gaming scene in upcoming years.","April 22, 2015","true","45.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has done a very good job of keeping me engaged and thinking, something that is rare in the gaming world today, at least for me.  The main puzzles are just challenging enough to make you border on frustration, but leave you very satisfied once you've completed them.  Collecting the stars, on the other hand, are borderline impossible to get all on your own.  I've resorted to looking at a guide for some of them, and I scratch my head at how in the world I was supposed to figure a few of them out.

Also, it's completely optional for those who just like puzzle games, however, I highly recommend pursuing at least a bit of the story, as it really is worth listening to and adds to the game's experience.\n\nI bought this game because I like puzzle games and games with stories (The Swapper, Mind:Path to Thalamus, etc) and thought that this looked interesting. The price tag is definitely worth it, as it's one of the best puzzle games i've ever played. The hard puzzles are hard enough to have you thinking (and you may have to try them a few times or skip and go back to them), but they're really fun and solvable without looking things up. I've had "aha!" moments and moments where I finally figured out the puzzle and facepalmed because the answer was right infront of me the entire time. Maybe my persistence was due to wanting to find out more of the story, as I usually look up the answer to other puzzle games when I get frustrated, but I didn't have to in TTP.\n\nThere are a few items that help you solve puzzles:\n- buttons on the ground that open a forcefield when something is on them\n- boxes (put these on buttons, Other people compare this game to Portal - I don't think they're that much alike besides the boxes/button mechanisms)\n- Jammers that jam turrets, fans, enemies, etc\n- Fans that blow you/boxes up in the air\n- Connectors that let you connect red and blue lightbeams to similarly colored spots\n- Memory machine that lets you create a copy of yourself to do actions\n\nAnd there are a few obstacles to get around in puzzles:\n- Orbs that move around and explode when you get near them\n- Forcefields that get in the way of you and laserbeams\n- Turrets that shoot you when you're in range of them\n\nPuzzles involve using helpful objects to open forcefields, jam turrets/orbs, and focus light beams on specific areas to gather "sigils" - or tetris-like pieces that are used to open doors to other arenas that contain more puzzles.\n\nIn summary, TTP is an amazing game that's worth the price, especially if it's on sale. The puzzles can be hard, but extremely fun and unique. The story kept me motivated to solve some of the harder puzzles myself, as I can give up easily sometimes. Would rate 10/10, one of the best puzzle games I've ever played, and I still missed some stuff in my playthrough.","March 17, 2015","true","24.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But The Talos Principle receives an early, wholehearted recommendation with a game that I can't wait to see to it's completion.\n\nPortal is the obvious immediate comparison both in its puzzle solving but also the intrigue in what's behind the puzzles and the world that's been created. Why are you here? What are you? Why are you solving puzzles in Greek and Egyption ruins?\n\nIt's intriguing and I feel like you'd be doing the game a disservice if you ignore the text(s) you can read and just steamroller through the puzzles.\n\nSpeaking of which, the puzzles seem to find that sweet spot between too easy and too hard, where some you'll solve quickly and others will be left with you scratching your head. Irrespective, finding the solution will make you feel clever and this is the sign of a puzzle game with a good sweet spot.\n\nUnless things take a very unexpected turn for the worse from this point on, I would definitely recommned this for anyone that's a fan of puzzle games, loved Portal and like a bit of intrigue and wonder to their games.

I went in thinking it was Portal, with robots and slight call backs to Serious Sam. It is all this, but also a lot more. There are meanderings of existentialism, ontology, served and servant, contradiction, and lastly devious puzzles that rely on strict rule sets. And then puzzles where you have to further break these rule sets.\n\nThis is THE puzzle game of 2014, and I'm sad I only sat down with it late in 2015.\n\nIt gets what its puzzles are amazingly well. In virtually all cases you can see the end goal (a sigil or star or other) up front, and it displays the tools to solve it clearly as well. This cleverly aids puzzle comprehension and makes you master the thought process of solving puzzles yourself, rather than the dealing with the mechanics arbitrarily and coming up against progress blocks through lack of understanding. Nothing is cheating in this game, and thus you feel even more empowered and clever when things click into place as all the pieces are there for your to figure out right at the start. Puzzles are hub based, and being stuck in one will not hinder your progress elsewhere, so you can come back later to that devious puzzle with fresh eyes.\n\nEaster eggs are also abound, and small touches like FOV adjustment, movement speed adjust, time skipping (fast-forwarding) are all in the options and add fantastically to make this game very difficult to criticise. It is purely your brain against the game, with nothing to hinder you otherwise. Lastly, this game smartly works with your Logitech keyboard screen to display statistics and other relevant information while you are playing, which is a neat little touch.\n\nLastly the world building although simple, is staggeringly complete and believable. A lot is made with such little to draw upon. The MLA (an AI (?) entity that converses with you via terminals about the land) and Elohim (an omnipresent, god-like voice), and even notes scrawled by other 'avatars' really ground you in whatever is going on in this game. Are you a mouse in a maze? Or something more?\n\nThis is a phenomenal game.

I hate puzzle games with a passion, and first person perspectives give me motion sickness.\n\nThis is the best game I have ever played.  By a substantial margin.  The story--both the narrative itself and the storytelling techniques/style used to tell it--is absolutely phenomenal.  Perhaps more importantly, it tells a story that inherently could only be told through a video game.  Combined with the optional third-person perspective that allows me to actually play it for more than 10 minutes at a time, even my hatred for the puzzle game genre is insufficient to turn me off of this game.  (And who knows?  You might even learn something.)\n\n11/10.","November 7, 2015","true","70.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I admit I was a little skeptical when I first thought of purchasing this game as it seemed like another Portal game and I just couldn’t get into Portal that much to finish it.\n\nThe puzzles within the game increase in complexity as you progress through the levels.  Some puzzles are related to others, so you’re not always working on a puzzle in isolation.  In a few cases, there are a number of different ways to solve the puzzles- it’s really up to your own creativity.\n\nThe reason I kept playing was really for the story.  As you complete puzzles and visit different gardens, a story emerges as to why these puzzles exist to begin with.  The story delves into the human condition and addresses some of those philosophical questions about what is consciousness, how do you define a person and so on.\n\nIn-fact, there’s a subversive character in the game that plays on those questions and challenges your character’s belief system.  The genius part is that if you choose not to take a side on the faith challenges, you’ll end-up with the only “bad” ending in the game.  Making a choice gives you a proper conclusion, whether it's good or bad is entirely up to you.\n\nIn short, if you’re looking for a casual game with a lot of depth and things to keep you entertained beyond solving the puzzles, then I highly recommend this game for you.\n","November 7, 2015","true","56.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay isn't as polished as Portal but it's still quite fun, especially if there's someone watching and offering advice. A few of the puzzles are ingenious, and thankfully ony a few are frustrating. The objectives on the final level in particular aren't very clear and unlike the rest of the game the last round is on a timer. But even then it's not so punishing that you'll want to smash your  keyboard in two.\n\nThe philosophical side is what really surprised me, though, and I found myself wanting to complete the missions to chat more with Milton, an AI you meet early on in the game, and to read and listen to the logs left throughout the levels. Many games use auto/text logs to progress the story, but I've never played a game where they were as compelling to follow as in the Talos Principle. The story behind the project and the reasons for the individuals doing what they did were quite moving and seemed very real. The writers of the game deserve a lot of praise for creating a story that could have been overwrought and manipulative, but was instead grounded and credible, and was much more powerful as a result. It seems silly to say, but this video game made me think and not just in the sense of solving puzzles. I actually learned something from the Talos Principle, and I hope it sticks with me. As one of the ideas explored in the game, free will is a personal choice, so I guess that's up to me.\n\nHighly recommended if you like puzzle games, philosophical debates and really excellent stories about the nature of artificial intelligence.","August 8, 2015","true","22.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Can you find better graphics? Almost certainly, but there is a great deal of direction and setting of scene in Talos that is effective in evoking what the game wants you to feel... awe in the face of the divine, doubt as to what you believe and the meaning of your goals. In terms of the puzzles trhemselves, these are not challenges requiring the fastest of response times nor a deep grasp of the underlying physics engine, some are rather simple, some are very challenging, some are so simple the challenge is breaking all the mistaken assumptions you've been building up solving other puzzles. This sort of puzzle game is not much for replayability, but in the case of Talos, where the puzzles are constructed to care about getting the end result not the process, there were sometimes several different solutions to the same challenge, you may have solved it one way, but can go back and try another.\n\nIn terms of the game's story, another puzzle... piece together fragments of diaries, documents, observations. Another puzzle, of a different sort, but one the game knows you're trying to solve and has ways of interacting with your efforts, force-fields and tiling locks for one's thinking not one's physical being. If the story itself is not groundbreaking, this approach to it buoys it upwards, taking advantage of what games can do as a storytelling medium. It is quite well done.\n\nIf you hate solving puzzles, or if you need certainty in your stories, there probably isn't much for you in Talos Principle. But if you enjoy figuring out the world around you, how do you get to the next step, or if you sometimes muse on what it means to be human, I'm sure you'll enjoy it as immensely as I did.","August 8, 2015","true","37.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Their motion sickness controls are pretty awesome, actually, which people like me appreciate.\n\nGood puzzles that hardly ever stump you, even if they do sometimes take a few tries, with interesting mechanics for solving them. The storyline, presented through the database, is interesting enough to keep me thinking about it in between getting new snipets. I like the god figure, the scientists that left behind their notes, and the "glitching" of the background, reminding you that the world is generated just for your robot avatar to explore.

As you go along you get to know more and more tidbits about the story and world you're playing in, and I think it's very atmospheric. It also has very interesting texts if you like reading, most of them philosophical. I don't really have a background in philosophy, so the game actually introduces me to cool concepts there. I hope it will carry on similar to this.\n\nAnother plus: It works great on my GNU/Linux system and has full voice over for other languages than English. (Sadly the subtitles aren't timed well, so I had to disable them. I'd rather play with subtitles, but if they're not correctly timed to the voice-over, I have a hard time following along.) Even if you have a lower end system, it should still work well because the graphic options go pretty low if you want them to. And if you have a powerful system it simply looks stunning.

Not just 'Puzzle platformer' games, one of my favorite games overall. It's rare (and kind of sad) that so few games nowadays actually make you think when you're playing it --not just 'how do I solve this puzzle', but broader questions about conscience, existence, and what it means to be alive.\n\nThe Talos Principle begins with you, a robotic being, waking up from slumber to the welcome of a god-like voice. It belongs to 'the creator', a being named Elohim, who claims to have created the world around you as a garden.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serializer/recommended/257510/","serializer","Mumra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serializer/","236 products in account","One of the best games of 2014, if not THE best. Many have compared this to Portal and this is not an unfair comparison, however that's not even a bad thing. Do you want more Portal? Of course you do. Are Valve likely to release another game ever in your lifetime? Questionable.\n\nSo if you've been wanting to get your fix of mute-protagonist-alone-in-dystopian-puzzle-prison-world-versus-disembodied-omnipotent-antagonist-jailkeeper-voice genre games, Croteam would appear to be the only studio currently delivering. The game is gorgeous, the puzzles are challenging but extremely logical and progress at just the right pace, and the story as delivered largely through Elohim's voice and text logs is both compelling and thoughtful. The game is full of "aha" moments, both in terms of the puzzles as well as the story, and it all wraps up in a satisfying conclusion with a great final set of puzzles that manages to turn many of the mechanics on their head again.\n\nThere are really only a couple of faults I can think of, and none of these were bad enough to at all spoil my enjoyment of the game.\n\nFirstly, as with any puzzle game of this nature, replay value will always be limited - a lot of the fun is in figuring out the solutions and uncovering the backstory, and you won't ever be able to repeat that experience, short of someone inventing some kind of mind-wipe technology. That still hasn't stopped me enjoying replaying Portal multiple times, but it's never the same as your first time. Sadly the Steam Workshop has very little in the way of new levels even 8 months after release. At some point I would like to go back through and unlock the bonus levels, however.\n\nSecondly, the hint system seems ... a little pointless. You have to complete a solid chunk of the game even to unlock it, and it is rather hard to find - I actually had to look up a spoiler to find out how to access the messenger worlds, and hints are extremely redundant once you're looking up spoilers. Even then you have to complete even more non-trivial puzzles to earn even a single hint! It's a nice bit of extra content but the complexity of it makes it seem more like a joke than a serious attempt to deliver hints.\n\nI suppose the only other thing here is that in terms of mechanics, this game doesn't really bring anything actually new to the table. All the puzzle mechanics have been done before - but the way they are executed against such a rich background, and the way they play off each other to create ever more intricate Rube Goldberg-type puzzles, is truly fantastic, and it certainly never feels like it's lacking.\n\nSo, a resounding thumbs up - this is one of my top games of all time. Just buy it.","August 25, 2015","true","32.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's rare (and kind of sad) that so few games nowadays actually make you think when you're playing it --not just 'how do I solve this puzzle', but broader questions about conscience, existence, and what it means to be alive.\n\nThe Talos Principle begins with you, a robotic being, waking up from slumber to the welcome of a god-like voice. It belongs to 'the creator', a being named Elohim, who claims to have created the world around you as a garden.

Everything takes place in scenic environments with glitches that betray the true nature of it all.\n\nAlthough I found the in-game existentialistic discussions constricted, it seemed to have been intentional.

The puzzles are relatively challenging, and although new concepts aren't introduced as frequently as they could be (I hope you love lasers), the overall aesthetic and gorgeous visuals engage the player to continue forward.\n\nThe backstory, and there's a lot of it, can be ignored, but it is recommended to read most of it, I'd say even more so than other 3D games with optional storylines like Metroid Prime. Some of the questions the game asks can be even more challenging to think about than the puzzles themselves. It's very philosophical and broad.

Sounds like a recipe for disaster, right?\n\nNope.\n\nThis is the closest thing to a piece of gaming art I've ever had the fortune to play.  I don't mean this in a progressive, vapid sense while pausing to contemplate such dire examples of that genre  like Gone Home or Sunset.  More in the sense that, more than any other game I've played, it submerges the player in the centre of the game and makes you ask questions of yourself, rather than, for example, pinning you to the shoulder of a protagonist just so they can ask questions for you.\n\nWhich, in my mind, is the central principle of gaming and the way it which it differentiates and defines itself as different from other entertainment mediums.  By teaching you something about yourself.\n\nAnyway ... first person puzzler, sometimes frustrating, often confusing, not for the impatient or those seeking blood and guts.  If you're after something different, a game that strives to stand out from the crowd while still maintaining a degree of AAA sensibilities, this is your boy.\n\nBuy it, thank me when you've finished it.\n\n","July 1, 2015","true","30.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, now I have played it for over 40 hours, I can see why reviews don't really say much about the game.  The more appealling features of this game are the repeated "eureka" moments throughout, and the less you know the better.  Exploring, finding things out, discovering "outside-of-the-box" ways of doing something, or stumbling upon the less-obvious, is what makes this game special.\n\nGameplay itself is straightforward and there's a multitude of options to tweak, and a decent selection of settings for motion-sickness sufferers.  I never played 3rd person once, so cannot comment on that.\n\nGraphics and visuals are nice.  3D geometry can be quite basic on some objects and in some areas, although this has been well disguised by high resolution textures and not that noticeable.  The ice crystals of snow, grains of sand, and the texture of stone, for example, are well defined and very clear.  There are a decent selection of settings to adjust, and although I have never tried lower settings when playing on my decent PC; my VERY low-spec Linux system ran the game at about 10fps (AMD Athlon II x2 250 : GeForce 210) so it should run on lower spec PCs with sacrifices.\n\nAll in all, I am impressed with The Talos Principle.  It's taken a few simple ideas and added so much depth that it's no longer skin-deep.  Polished, refined and detailed spring to mind; which is far more important to me than incredibly complex and shallow.\n\n10/10","July 7, 2015","true","46.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was proven wrong.\n\nGraphics\nThis won't be the most awesome game you've ever seen but it still looks awesome as the different worlds and levels are completely different.\n8.5/10\n\nSound\nThe sound fits to the game even though there are a few sounds that are a bit strange and don't fit to the situation.\n9/10\n\nGameplay\nThe game starts pretty easy and becomes challenging really fast. But after like 2/3rds of the game the complexity will nearly stay the same even though it won't be repetitive. A little more challenging levels towards the end would have helped the game a lot.\n9/10\n\nStory\nThe story behind Talos Principle is awesomely well written and the voice actors fit perfectly to their characters. Being able to decide is one of the best aspects of the story. But it also lets you think about unanswerable questions like the meaning of life.\n10/10\n\nOverall the game is awesome to play as the puzzles are quite challenging but still fair and the story gives you chills until you finally know what will happen at the end. I'd recommend it to everybody that likes puzzle games like Portal but consider yourself warned as the game doesn't offer anything else than story and puzzle solving!\n9/10","September 28, 2015","true","23.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You got the obvious puzzles you got to solve where you are free to chose which one you do first and which later. Then you got the storyline which you are solving by yourself by constantly thinking about the scripts you read in each part of the world. But finally you got the biggest puzzle about your existence which is bugging you constantly by having dialogues with an AI somewhat like one of the first text-based-computergames ever. The only difference is, that you're not allowed to type in your own answers but instead to chose between different answers. Though these answers are pretty much almost all you'd like to put in anyway so it's not a negative point in any way.\n\nYou get in this game:\n- to chose which puzzles to solve first\n- the opportunity to do puzzles only if you like\n- different endings (don't expect too much difference^^)\n- existencial questions you might never asked yourself\n- different ways to solve puzzles (i often used some wallclimbing and jumping if i didn't find the obvious solution after a few minutes)\n- lots of funny eastereggs\n\nall in all it's a solid 9.5/10! I would say in a sale it's a definitely 10/10.\nThough you don't need the DLC's... most of the "original puzzles" are already in the game.\n\nBUT - the soundtrack is purely awesome.

Since I have so much less time in my life for gaming, it's rare for a game to suck me in right away, but this one did it for me. The consistency of puzzle difficulty is solid. I really appreciated the precision in the puzzles - it's clear that they took time in crafting each one to avoid cheap workarounds. Granted, some of the puzzle mechanics are similar at times, but the game introduces a new dynamic just when you think you've got it mastered.\n\nI love puzzle games in general, but this one particularly struck me because there is a discernible, albeit cryptic storyline. It kept me compelled to continue, and I felt like solving the puzzles had a purpose, which is a pretty amazing feat for a puzzle game. Tack on the fact that this game has multiple endings - just when I thought it couldn't get more impressive.\n\nAdditionally, I loved the music.

He puts you into his "garden" and you must solve all his puzzles, or "challenges", in order to gain eternal life by his side.\nIn the course of the game you will find Audio Files, no spoilers about what thouse are, and the Terminals, from which you will communicate with another being, as well as finding files (note, the files are way to many and if you dont want to, just dont read them, it will not affect the course of the story, though it will make your experience better).\n\nSome tips so that new players won't have to struggle as i have to get the achievements:\n\n-If you are interested on the achievements, read a guide first on how to get them. As for my playthrough, you can use the backup feature in order to get some Exclusive achievements.\n-The one that you should really be carefull about is "Hedging My Bets", so don't solve ANY red sigil puzzles until you have completed all 21 areas in the 3 lands.\n\nFrom now on there are gonna be some spoilers ahead, so if you don't want to be spoiles about the game, stop reading the review now.\n\nIn the end you are given 3 different choices:\n-The first is to gain the Eternal Life, by entering through the white gate in Land C (the easy way)\n-The second is to ascend the tower, by going up all 5 floors, and then you have to solve some puzzles in order to finish the game. BEWARE that if you die in any of those puzzles you will have to start all over from the end of the staircase. I fell way too many times by mistake, so i have to warn you as well (the hard way)\n-The final one is by becoming a messenger. In order to achieve it you will have to collect all the stars from the lands, plus the extra ones. This is way to difficult and time-consuming.\n\nThis game, or Masterpiece, is trully one of the best and one of the most well made and meaningfull games i have ever played. I haven't enjoyed so much of playing a game since i finished Portal 2.\nI TOTALLY recommend this game to anyone, it gave me an amazing time and i hope it will give you as well.\n\n10/10","February 6","true","26.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You should play this. It's a great first-person puzzler with a surprisingly enthralling narrative. Play it if you have any interest at all in the genre. Play it. Yes, you.\n\nI picked it up in a sale since I liked Portal and Antichamber, and ended up getting something like a combination thereof with a side of Asimov-lite. The Portal (2) influences are particularly strong in both the mechanics and the aesthetic, but it brings a lot of other things to the table. Great puzzle gameplay with a great sci-fi setting and story, and against all odds an exploratory feel.\n\nThe basic puzzle mechanics in this game are far from original (the over-industrialized cubes and lasers should be very familiar), but they are deftly combined into a wide array of puzzles that stay fresh until the end. There are a few puzzles that are frustrating because they are more about execution than thinking, but for the most part this is very well avoided. One example is jumping, which can be done as in a typical first-person game but also via an unintrusive helper mechanic to assist with jumping on to moving platforms. Upon seeing this for the first time I was skeptical, but in practice it feels very smooth and doesn't break immersion in the way similar things (e.g. cover mechanics in some FPS) often do.\n\nI found the pacing of the puzzles to be excellent, and the way in which they are unlocked smooths out any bump in the road - while there is an overall linear progression that introduces new mechanics and increases complexity, you can always leave a puzzle and try another. (The progression is very flexible if you want to be - I think you can unlock something like 70% of the game's puzzles by solving about 20% of them.) This is a slightly more artificial implementation of the way Antichamber plays out, and initially makes the game's environments seem rather sterile and segmented - each puzzle is fenced in and items cannot be brought in or out of their entrances.  But when you try to break these chains the world really gets interesting - not only are there loads of easter eggs to be found, but in fact there are a lot of bonus puzzles that rely on rule-bending. Thus the game world feels open and exciting to explore, despite its very artificially delineated nature.\n\nThe narrative is what really caught me by surprise. While the majority of it is delivered via text and audio logs, this isn't just a crutch or cost-cutting. It's all superbly well written, and fits together just well enough to gradually build up a cohesive understanding of the game world without spoon-feeding you. The gameplay and the story are almost completely disjointed, which normally would be something to criticize; but the unusual nature of Talos' setting makes it feel perfect here. (That unusual setting also allows the game to be very self-aware without ever breaking the fourth wall, which is super cute.) Even the QR codes that are initially just flavour end up tying in with the story.\n\nThe writing always does exactly what it intends to - it all feels very genuine. It's hilarious, thought-provoking and heartfelt at different points, each exactly when it means to be.  Reading some coverage of the game after playing, it seems much is made of the philosophical aspect. If you've done much thinking about metaphysics and ethics then it's unlikely there will be any new ideas for you here, but the game never feels like it's trying too hard - the philosophical diversions have an in-universe reason to exist and are extremely engagingly presented. Despite never having my "mind blown", I always looked forward to the next little debate.\n\nMy only real complaint would be that the story ran out too fast - I felt like I got 80% of the narrative in my first 10 hours playing, and the other 20 hours were dominated by puzzling. Perhaps I should be grateful that the bonus puzzles provided even the tidbits of story that they did; but the alternate ending for 100% completion is really quite underwhelming. There's one big narrative payoff for finishing the core of the gameplay, after which you're left with some of the best puzzles but almost nothing else. That said, the payoff was amazing (despite not being a surprise) and the puzzles alone (and a few secrets I stumbled upon along the way) were enough to keep me engrossed right through to 100%.\n\nThe game is technically very pretty for something that came from a moderately small developer, and the assets are all high quality if a bit repetitive. Once again the setting prevents this from breaking immersion, but aside from the few moments when you first discover visually different areas, it's repetitive nonetheless. This never really bothered me - I was too busy solving puzzles, and some of those moments I mentioned made up for it. There are a few vistas that are truly awe-inspiring when first revealed, especially thanks to the amazing accompaniment of the soundtrack, which is consistently on point - it fits the tone and aesthetic of the game extremely well, and adapts smoothly to fit the mood. For the most part it's slow paced and contemplative, almost ambient - the almost complete lack of percussion means it never distracts from puzzle-solving. It's only at key moments of exploration and progress that it comes to the fore, and it does so with gusto. (Good soundtrack for listening to while working!)\n\nI don't think there's much else to say. Play it.","October 7, 2015","true","54.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","0","1","1","3","0"

I don't have the Road to Gehenna DLC yet.\n\nFolks that know me know that I have a... thing... for puzzles. So when the demo first came out for this, I grabbed it out of curiosity. And I grabbed it recently, when the opportunity presented itself. I was glad that my graphics card could handle it, because the worlds in this game are beautiful. There are plenty of things to get you ooohing and ahhing to the point where you might miss out on things here and there, whether it be something key to a puzzle, or one of the boatloads of easter eggs the devs put in this game.\n\nBut let's get to the nitty-gritty here: the puzzles. Plenty of free roaming areas within the puzzle rooms, much like what was done with the Portal series, and some bonus items can only be gotten with some interaction with different puzzle rooms. Each of the puzzle rooms has a sigil as its goal, which can be used with others to unlock different areas and different objects to be used in later sections. Outside of the free roaming ability, the game also uses the idea of building on pravious puzzles, so that you don't feel too overwhelmed. Still, some of these puzzles can turn into That One Level pretty quick.\n\nThe storyline you get from accessing terminals, throughout the levels, as well as getting into a pilosophical/spiritual argument with another AI. This made for a nice little twist.\n\nReplay value? Well, it's mainly going to be for getting the rest of the achievements, and maybe the variants of the multiple endings. Or just seeing how well you can speed-run through it. But on the whole, this game was a nicely delivered package and certainly fun to explore. It gets an A.","August 5, 2015","true","44.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's from croteam, so if you like the aesthetics of Serious Sam 3, it reminds me a good deal of that.\n\nThe puzzles are entertaining, though they do tend to tutorialize the hell out of every new mechanic. It wasn't bad enough to notice while I played, but in retrospect it seemed like they took quite a while.\n\nWhat I didn't expect was there is a plot to the game, and the writing is all very solid. There is an overarching, satisfying story to the world, and I spent a fair amount of my time excitedly hoovering up all the lorebits whenever possible, which is always a good sign.","February 6","true","36.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shroud3d/recommended/257510/","Shroud3d","Shroud3d","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shroud3d/","184 products in account","So this is a puzzle game which gives you access to the minimal amount of objects to complete each puzzle and slowly introduces new mechanics one at a time, similar to Portal I suppose. There are a couple of deviations to this theme and some puzzles contain traps, but the game is never unfair. In general, the game also slowly teaches you how to use the objects for things they don't seem to be intended for. The difference with Portal is that the puzzles in this game do get old eventually, but the moment they get old is when you're almost done with the game. Sadly, the end of game collect-a-thon is a necessity for all endings.\n\nAnd that's one thing which I dislike in a game like this, because some of the puzzles are quite frustrating, aka the ones where you die and restart at the wrong solutions. Others are motion-sickness inducing, especially the ones that involve the recording machine. The game even encourages you to step away from puzzles if you can't figure them out. Fortunately none of the puzzles are very long so even the annoying ones won't bother you much. When you step away and come back to the puzzles later, they do seem a lot easier, so you're apparently learning something along the way which is always nice.\n\nThere are also a lot of door puzzles which involve placing tetrominos in a square, I have yet to figure out a good method for this but I trial and errored my way through all of them somehow.\n\nA cool mechanic is that some of the optional stars involve sneaking out of a level with an object or pointing a beam from outside of one puzzle to someplace elsewhere. Really gets you thinking literally 'outside the box'.\n\nThere's also a lot of references to Greek mythology if you're into that, and some intricate philosophical dillemas. Overall, these did not add much for me, but they are a nice distraction from the puzzles.\n\nOverall, the game gives you a good amount of enjoyment for its price if you happen to stumble upon it during a sale. 40 bucks is a bit of a stretch for a game with about 15 hours of content and no replay value (unless you want to find all bonus stars, something you can just do with your original save file anyway).","February 13","true","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have played hundreds upon hundreds of games, and few have actually managed to change my life.\nThe Talos Principle is one of those games.\nI started playing this at a very difficult time of my life, when I felt like I didn't have control over the circumstances surrounding me. I was crushed by a sense of powerlessness, and naturally, games provided a small sanctuary from that. However, I couldn't convince myself that the empowerment I felt was real; after all, it's just pixels on a screen.\n\nThis is the only game I have ever played that legitimately made me feel like I was living in another reality. From the pitch-perfect visuals, to the soul-infiltrating soundtrack, to the remarkable performances on display, to, most importantly, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ writing, I was sucked in from the start. Whenever I accessed one of the story-driving terminals in the game, I felt a sense of discovery and wonder that I've never felt before in a game; the superb quality of the writing, and obvious classical literacy of the developers, helped with that considerably.\n\nAnd then, the puzzles. Oh my dear lord, the puzzles. I was challenged, driven to madness, validated, and forced to think in ways I didn't know a game could push me to think. This was true accomplishment. When I got that final star (yeah, I played a lot), I felt like the king of this wonderful, apocalyptic, serene, beautiful little world Croteam managed to create.\n\nAfter all of those trials and tribulations, heartbreak and awe, experiencing the ending was a form of real-world nirvana. I have never felt so awed, fulfilled, and humbled by a piece of entertainment. The Talos Principle goes beyond the genre, elevating itself to a place alongside some of the greatest philosophical works of all time. It's personal, epic, powerful, and nuanced all at the same time. In short, it's perfect.\n\nEven if you don't enjoy puzzle games, I invite you to step inside the world of ELOHIM.

Alone and isolated, you have just the occasional mysterious voice or text program to communicate with. Everything else are scraps of the past you have to find and piece together which helps build into the atmosphere of exploring not just ruins but history. It's a game about making you think, not just about how to solve puzzles but about the very essence of existence.\n\nSome of the puzzles are frustratingly difficult because of the lack of any explanation of the puzzle tools and finding most of the gold stars are just unfair, with a good number of them relying less on logic and more on hiding the puzzle pieces under the sofa where you'll never find them. That said, the gold stars are optional (except for us OCD 100%ers) and I rarely ran into a manadory puzzle I couldn't solve. I just needed to leave it for awhile and come back later with a fresh perspective. Part of it is probably because I read a few reviews of the games that mentioned a few of the quirkier mechanics that would be hard to figure out on your own.\n\nOverall, I greatly enjoyed the story and the puzzles and would recommend it to anyone looking for a thoughtful, slow-paced, thinking game with a great atmosphere.","August 6, 2015","true","33.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The puzzles are relatively challenging, and although new concepts aren't introduced as frequently as they could be (I hope you love lasers), the overall aesthetic and gorgeous visuals engage the player to continue forward.\n\nThe backstory, and there's a lot of it, can be ignored, but it is recommended to read most of it, I'd say even more so than other 3D games with optional storylines like Metroid Prime. Some of the questions the game asks can be even more challenging to think about than the puzzles themselves. It's very philosophical and broad. What it means to be human is the overall theme, I think. Or maybe what it means to be conscious? The purpose of our lives? Most of it went over my head because I just wanted to solve more puzzles, but it all ties in to the actual sequence of past events you discover along your journey to either eternity or 'the truth' about what happened to a team of scientists tasked with preserving all the world's information before some cataclysmic event.\n\nThe puzzles, the story, the excessive amount of well hidden easter eggs, and the overall calm ambient aesthetic are all meticulously detailed and very engaging, well worth the asking price.","June 29, 2015","true","30.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sounds like a recipe for disaster, right?\n\nNope.\n\nThis is the closest thing to a piece of gaming art I've ever had the fortune to play.  I don't mean this in a progressive, vapid sense while pausing to contemplate such dire examples of that genre  like Gone Home or Sunset.  More in the sense that, more than any other game I've played, it submerges the player in the centre of the game and makes you ask questions of yourself, rather than, for example, pinning you to the shoulder of a protagonist just so they can ask questions for you.\n\nWhich, in my mind, is the central principle of gaming and the way it which it differentiates and defines itself as different from other entertainment mediums.  By teaching you something about yourself.\n\nAnyway ... first person puzzler, sometimes frustrating, often confusing, not for the impatient or those seeking blood and guts.  If you're after something different, a game that strives to stand out from the crowd while still maintaining a degree of AAA sensibilities, this is your boy.\n\nBuy it, thank me when you've finished it.\n\n","July 1, 2015","true","30.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One of the best games this year!\n\nEDIT: After completing the game I can safely say that the ending is also top notch.

Its puzzles are challenging and require full concentration and perserverence to ensure success and when that success is finally acheived, damn it feels good. This is also very much the same for the game's lore. It revolves around multiple philsophical and religious theories and arguments and it is up to your interpretation of these theories to discover what the right way through Elohim's garden is. The Talos Principle is great in explaining itself without the player feeling patronised and does not require any real knowledge of the theories it employs going into the game, although those with an interest in the debates contained within the game will get significantly more out of playing than a casual gamer. Finally, you will learn something; whether it be about logic strategies or yourself and the world around you. Either way, you will feel rewarded at the game's end.

What they're really worried about is that someone might prove, once and for all, that consciousness can arise from matter. And I kind of understand why they find it so terrifying. If we can create a sentient being, where does that leave the soul? Without mystery, how can we see ourselves as anything other than machines? And if we are machines, what hope do we have that death is not the end?\n\nWhat really scares people is not the artificial intelligence in the computer, but the "natural" intelligence they see in the mirror."\n\nIt really is as good as reviews say.

Alone and isolated, you have just the occasional mysterious voice or text program to communicate with. Everything else are scraps of the past you have to find and piece together which helps build into the atmosphere of exploring not just ruins but history. It's a game about making you think, not just about how to solve puzzles but about the very essence of existence.\n\nSome of the puzzles are frustratingly difficult because of the lack of any explanation of the puzzle tools and finding most of the gold stars are just unfair, with a good number of them relying less on logic and more on hiding the puzzle pieces under the sofa where you'll never find them. That said, the gold stars are optional (except for us OCD 100%ers) and I rarely ran into a manadory puzzle I couldn't solve. I just needed to leave it for awhile and come back later with a fresh perspective. Part of it is probably because I read a few reviews of the games that mentioned a few of the quirkier mechanics that would be hard to figure out on your own.\n\nOverall, I greatly enjoyed the story and the puzzles and would recommend it to anyone looking for a thoughtful, slow-paced, thinking game with a great atmosphere.","August 6, 2015","true","33.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But you will be engaged, and you will be very, very thoughtful after finishing it. The puzzle aspect is astonishingly well designed. You can have a complex, impossible-looking 20-part puzzle which must be solved in a certain order, and somehow, you'll just look at it and figure it out.

While part of your brain is working on the puzzle the rest of it is wondering whats going on. In trying to find out whats happening the game streches what, and who, your willing to beleve.\n\nAll that being said it isn't quite a 40 dollar game to me, so unless you have a thing for puzzle games and philosophy I suggest to wait for a sale.\n\nAlso a warrning to completionists, the optional chalenges are HARD and some are nearly impossible to find let alone solve without help.

I also played through the demo before release and it was fantastic. As you go along you get to know more and more tidbits about the story and world you're playing in, and I think it's very atmospheric. It also has very interesting texts if you like reading, most of them philosophical. I don't really have a background in philosophy, so the game actually introduces me to cool concepts there. I hope it will carry on similar to this.\n\nAnother plus: It works great on my GNU/Linux system and has full voice over for other languages than English. (Sadly the subtitles aren't timed well, so I had to disable them. I'd rather play with subtitles, but if they're not correctly timed to the voice-over, I have a hard time following along.) Even if you have a lower end system, it should still work well because the graphic options go pretty low if you want them to. And if you have a powerful system it simply looks stunning.

I can literally not think of any other problems with this game apart from the fact that some patience with reading is required to follow the story. Aside from that, this game is a full-blown masterpiece.\n\nThe story is thoughtprovoking, mysterious and innovative. It's best to experience it yourself but I can say that it was very difficult for me to stop playing this to go to sleep; I wanted to continue all night just to continue the story!\n\nThe puzzles are numerous and difficult. The game has many puzzle elements, unlike for example Portal which only has a couple like buttons and portals. This makes the puzzles very difficult but satisfying to solve.\n\nThe scenery of the game is beautiful. Ancient ruins in the mix of flowing fields of grass and trees makes for some nice eye-candy throughout the game. The soundtrack accompanies the scenery nicely and has a mysterious feel similar to the story.\n\nThe dialogue options can sometimes leave you baffled with what to say. Expect serious existential questions that may leave you thinking for minutes. The dialogue also affects the course of the game somewhat, although there is not much influence on the actual endings. Multiple endings makes up for this fine though.\n\nThe game also has a plethora of easter eggs, all of them pretty difficult to find. Happy hunting!\n\nThe game tells the story by old documents, leaving you to piece together what has happened. For me, this was very exciting and I always craved the next piece in the grand puzzle of the story. I can imagine though, that reading this much can be tedious or boring for other players. I would highly recommend reading the documents anyway, since it is an integral part to the whole experience. It might take a bit for the story to hook you. The puzzles could still entertain a puzzle enthusiast though, without the story.\n\nAll in all, an excellent game. I'd recommend it to anyone with a minimal amount of patience to read the story pieces.","February 18","true","39.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What they're really worried about is that someone might prove, once and for all, that consciousness can arise from matter. And I kind of understand why they find it so terrifying. If we can create a sentient being, where does that leave the soul? Without mystery, how can we see ourselves as anything other than machines? And if we are machines, what hope do we have that death is not the end?\n\nWhat really scares people is not the artificial intelligence in the computer, but the "natural" intelligence they see in the mirror."\n\nIt really is as good as reviews say.

The puzzling is challenging without being cheap or unfair.  (A notable exception would be the nearless endless supply of tile puzzles and some of the stars are simply impossible to work out and require looking up, but the stars are not necessary to completing the game and seeing everything it has to show.)  The writing is incredibly strong.  Some of the strongest writing I've come across in years, to be honest.  The last time I felt this impressed by a game's writing was when I played The Swapper (another brilliant, though almost impossibly difficult, game) so it wasn't a surprise to learn that the writer of The Swapper also worked on this game.

It's a new meta, ala Charlie Kaufman but within a slightly more physical world than reading or watching. It's both of those but it's also the movement. The ability to "control" a character which then forces you to think about why you would want to do this at all.

I did not expect to love this game as much as I did.\n\nPros:\n- Great writing, well beyond what I've come to expect in modern games. Great story. Everything ties together so well.\n- Conversations are very dynamic and extremely personalized. How you get along with a particular NPC depends on the player. It allows for people of many different belief sets.\n- Puzzles are adequately challenging.\n- Beautiful design, great scenery in the game.\n- Never encountered any bugs. Game ran smoothly.\n- The little voice acting in this game is all extremely well done for what it is.\n\nCons:\n- Pacing is a little slow. There is a lot of story but it seems like you have to put in many hours of work to reach every new bit.\n- Not a fan of the 'hub world' design in which you walk into partitioned maps.\n- The game should have been a lot shorter.\n- The puzzles are almost insultingly easy at first, though they do become much harder.\n\nI went into this thing very critical. Almost immediately I was exhausted by the pretentious and blatantly self-indulgent philosophical musing. It was so heavy handed, and I imagined one of the designers was practically touching himself over getting license to write extensively on the topic and FINALLY be able to utilize his otherwise useless bachelor's in philosophy.\n\nHowever, as the game went on, things took a turn. The story became gripping and powerful. The philosophical spouting ebbed away and was replaced by real questions, real conversation, and growing sense of suspicion. I became desperate for every shred of story I was fed. Every time I found a new terminal, I hungrily read every new document. Because not all of them are about Greek philosophers and Bible passages. Many of them document the lives of the people who put you where you are. You learn who they were, what they were like, and what they were most afraid of.\n\nAnd god, it was just terrific. I did not expect to love this game. I didn't expect to become so emotionally invested in the story. I don't want to spoil anything, but the ending was better than I could have hoped. The storytelling is *incredibly* intuitive, smart, and artistic. They know how to tell a story without over- or under-telling it. The bits of text you glanced over in earlier in the game become very relevant later. Everything just ties together so damn well.\n\nEven the ENDING choices were inuitive. The most difficult ending to achieve may not be what you think (which in a game is refreshing, since usually you have to really commit to get anything positive). I watched a video of the same ending that I got, and it still differed because of the choices I'd made earlier.\n\nMy chief complaint about the game is that it runs a bit long. The puzzles become repetitive, and there are far too many of them. It suffers a lot, I'd say, from the same mistakes Assassin's Creed 1 made when it became overly formulaic and a bit boring.\n\nThe story and the writing, however, make it worth it. And in the end, the writing wasn't as pretentious as I thought it was. They knew exactly what they were doing, and they knew when it became unimportant to bother with pointless existentialist pondering.\n\nAnd of course I have to add that the aesthetic design of the game was absolutely gorgeous. I've never been compelled to take so many screenshots. I've never seen skies as beautiful in any other game.\n\nIf you started this game but got sick of the writing and put it down, reconsider. You won't regret reaching the end.","March 10","true","25.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The world is beautifully rendered, the music is superb, the puzzles are decently challenging (cannot speak to Road to Gehenna - haven't played it yet) and the backstory is well-written and well-presented and the voice acting is excellent. There is lots of philosophical discussion and questioning, so count that as a plus if you're into that kind of thing and a minus if you're not.\n\nMost puzzles have fairly linear solutions, so it becomes a matter of figuring out what you can do with the resources available to you. If there is one area that left me a bit disappointed, and I'll leave out two massively multi-mine puzzles that just left me frustrated, it is the repetitiveness. While each puzzle is clearly distinct, the sheer number of them and the mechanics of using the solution tools gets old after the 50th or 60th puzzle.\n\nExpect to spend 30-40 hours playing through the base game and a bit longer if you're going to try to grab all of the achievements (there is one tied to each of the three endings, so some replay will be necessary). It's well worth the purchase price (especially if you can catch it on sale) and you'll be thinking about the game long after you've finished it.","March 10","true","42.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Starts simple, nudges you learning new things, then stretches your education. Its not challenging, sometimes the game requries you to look at things a particular way over and over.\n\nThe story... I'm gonna try not to spoil so much... but you play a robot that is essentially a test subject in which you solve puzzles. I'm seriously trying not to spoil the end because the more I say, the more I'm implying when I reveal what happens to you. Just read all the text, listen to all the audio recordings, and check QR codes in game that expand the game. Most of the bulk is philsophical commentary surrounding culture, history, religion... etc\n\nGraphics remind me of Serious Sam, they aren't taxing on systems but you do have to be able to run the engine.\nAudio isn't too bad, the music MAY be memorable... but you get like 3-5 songs per world on random loop.

That's all that I knew when I jumped into the game.\nMy conclusion after finishing it is... that it's one of the best puzzle game ever.\nIt's surprising because at the very beginning it felt like a simple and quite weird title. It feels like a mod, it's not particularly pretty or impressive in any technical way. But the developers were obviously in love with the project and made on of the most "perfect" game out there, and by perfect I don't mean that it's better than any other games but that it succeeded in everything it tried to be, everything that the devs put into it. And it's obviously easier when it's not a "huge complicated immersive open world RPG" but just a first person puzzle game.\n\nThe core of the game is the puzzles, you use and place objects to get to a key that will help unlocking the future puzzles until the final one. And the mechanics are straightforward, a hacking tool that you place to deactivate an item, for exemple to open doors or immobilize dangerous "bomb bots" (lets call them that), a good old fashion box, a tool that helps you connect beam emitters to their receptors by directing the beam. Then later, fans to make objects move or float, recorders that splits you in two characters by recording your action during am interval, a plate that makes you a moving platform for this other you after you split. It might seem a bit complicated but those mechanics are introduced very slowly throughout the game and every single idea about how to use them is intuitively hinted in the puzzle. And it would be hard to make puzzles more intuitive than in this game, without taking your hand and removing the fun of solving it yourself. The game never explain something directly, but everything is though to help you figure it out, with the level design.\nSo that's it then, great mechanics introduced perfectly make this a great puzzle game ! Yeah, if you succeed at making the game deep enough (that also mean long enough) and interesting in more than one aspect to make you entertained and keep the fun alive.\n\nThat's the other big success of The Talos Principle, it's at least 15 to 20 hours long to make a near 100% run and I did not get bored. The game is challenging at some time, I'm happy that I finished it without any help, it's rewarding. But even when puzzle were a bit easy, hold on "shift" and speed run the puzzle like a champ. It's also rewarding to finish a puzzle game very quickly, that crazy sprint might seem like too much at the beginning but it's perfect once you master some mechanics to keep your actions almost as fast as your brain.\nNow, the mood of the game, while sublime graphical effects and an insane soundtrack might sound great, it would actually have distracted the player while he is solving puzzle. So the graphics feels simple, the music is calm, peaceful and quiet enough. The only distractions you have are between the puzzles, a character is talking to you from above (how original) and lead the scenario progression, the lore of the game is perfectly fit for its gameplay, there is audio logs to play and background text to read. Oh no, I'm not a fan of reading in a game, it makes me really bored and kills the mood and immersion in a game for me, I'm probably gonna miss out the whole lore by ignoring those text. Well, that's what I though, but "Nay" is the answer to that. It's well written, really fascinating for most of them and each is short enough so that you know you will finish reading each of them in no time. Rarely in a game I've been that much into the texts documents.\nIt's also thanks to the lore of the game that, while it has almost no character arcs or great details about a fantastic world you'll want to live in, is making you think a lot about ourselves. Ok, I'm sure people found those subjects and reflections very arrogant and pretentious, but if you really are curious about it, forget your boring high school philosophical classes and make yourself think and answer those subjects, it IS interesting and greatly introduced into the experience. You will start dialogs with the game you would not even believe. And so what we get from all this is a fully realized experience, with at is core a puzzle game for sure, but also an identity. It is the sort of game you could hardly imagine a sequel, it already is enough to himself.\n\nI will say this, I always had this thinking that to many developers don't realize all of what a game can be, and focus too much on certains obvious qualities that a game should have, while forgetting so many others. Few games are great in so many aspects and also take a chance at having something to say. And it is this kind of experience that you will remember.","March 4","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

Every one you solve feels meaningful and provides you with some kind of motivation to move on and find out more about the story. And the story is absolutely incredible.

Additional puzzles are sometimes completely insane, but they are there if it's something you are looking for.\n\nA lot of thought is put into preventing motion sickness for people that get it in first-person games, which I personally appreciate a ton.\n\nOverall one of the best games I played in the recent years.\n","March 4","true","30.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can predict the plot without too many problems, but there's still so much pleasure in taking part.\n\n-Puzzles are a mix of critical thinking and a lack of overthinking.  You learn how to properly switch between large-scale planning, and smaller-scale instinct for resolving puzzles that can either be large and complex or a series of small tasks.\n\n-Incredible philosophical discussion.  Note that I'm not saying "incredible philosophy".  The game likes to mess with your perspectives and make you question them regardless of what they may be.  The in-game conversations also provide insight into how to properly discuss a philosophical subject like consciousness (or show you that there might not be a proper way to have such dialogue).\n\n-Lots of exploring, contrary to how it may seem at first.  You just have to look around the maps and you glean most of the story this way.  They do reward you for looking around, you can only make complete sense of the events by exploring, sort of like how Bioshock has the audiotapes around.\n\n-Really great aesthetically, like beautiful.  Gameplay is incredibly smooth too.\n\n\nThe devs really went out of their ways to offer an incredible game with atmosphere that is UNIQUE to their own art style and writing.  The soundtrack is also pretty great too, doesn't overpower the game.  IMO this is one of the best games I've picked up in years.  $40 is actually worth it if you consider that it'll probably take you 30+ hours to beat, more likely 40+ if you do all the extra stuff in a very quick amount of time.  I left this review just because I felt the devs REALLY deserve as much praise as they could get for their work.  8/10.   Only thing that could be improved is that it could've been longer for the price they're offering, but at $10 it is a STEAL.","December 23, 2015","true","32.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I admit I was a little skeptical when I first thought of purchasing this game as it seemed like another Portal game and I just couldn’t get into Portal that much to finish it.\n\nThe puzzles within the game increase in complexity as you progress through the levels.  Some puzzles are related to others, so you’re not always working on a puzzle in isolation.  In a few cases, there are a number of different ways to solve the puzzles- it’s really up to your own creativity.\n\nThe reason I kept playing was really for the story.  As you complete puzzles and visit different gardens, a story emerges as to why these puzzles exist to begin with.  The story delves into the human condition and addresses some of those philosophical questions about what is consciousness, how do you define a person and so on.\n\nIn-fact, there’s a subversive character in the game that plays on those questions and challenges your character’s belief system.  The genius part is that if you choose not to take a side on the faith challenges, you’ll end-up with the only “bad” ending in the game.  Making a choice gives you a proper conclusion, whether it's good or bad is entirely up to you.\n\nIn short, if you’re looking for a casual game with a lot of depth and things to keep you entertained beyond solving the puzzles, then I highly recommend this game for you.\n","November 7, 2015","true","56.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A spiritual successor of portal but slower and with a greater emphasis on exploration. Its full of puzzles which are excellent and non-linear in nature, there's tons of Easter Eggs.\n\nAn intellectual exercise with an emphasis on philosophy regarding the nature of life, consciousness, reality, morality, naturalism vs supernaturalism, obedience, and authority. The story centers on the question of obedience to authority which claims divinity (aka the morality morality thereof; divine command theory) in the absence of a moral reference points or certainty of actual divinity.\n\nAnd if you don't actually know what any of those things are I assure you, you don't necessarily need any knowledge on those subjects to understand or appreciate the dilemmas presented in the story. That said if you have some background knowledge in those areas you will probably get more out of the experience.\n\nGetting the full experience does require a -lot- of time exploring and digging for secrets, however I think the story would stand up if one didn't read all the texts.

At first, the game might feel as if the story is just thrown in later to explain why you have to be solving those puzzles and collecting sigils, and why there are strange terminals scattered around the world which feel out of place. But only as you continue your journey, you start to realize that everything is there for a reason, that all the parts fall together to create a great and compelling story, a story which you want to know the end of.\n\nA story alone isn't enough to keep a puzzle game interesting of course, and Croteam surely understood that. The puzzles are satisfying to solve, sometimes pretty hard, but never unsolvable (not talking about the star puzzles, some were so ridiculously complicated that I had to look up a walkthrough). The level design is great and they paid great attention to angles. They also rarely give you more stuff than you need, which is fair considering red herrings are often very difficult to spot.\n\nThe graphics are amazing in my opinion, I love the photorealistic textures and the Serious Engine provides great contrast, which makes shadows look extremely good. Sometimes, when I had some trouble solving a puzzle, I would just walk around in of the beautiful lands (or gardens, as Elohim would call them) and listen to the soothing music.\n\nThe story itself, along with the terminals, provides a nice break from the sometimes brain-wrecking puzzles. You really have to experience the story for yourself, and the sense of amazement you feel when everything starts to slowly make sense and you realize this isn't an empty game at all.\n\nTL;DR: Buy it already, 10/10 would climb the tower again.","January 31","true","70.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's all that I knew when I jumped into the game.\nMy conclusion after finishing it is... that it's one of the best puzzle game ever.\nIt's surprising because at the very beginning it felt like a simple and quite weird title. It feels like a mod, it's not particularly pretty or impressive in any technical way. But the developers were obviously in love with the project and made on of the most "perfect" game out there, and by perfect I don't mean that it's better than any other games but that it succeeded in everything it tried to be, everything that the devs put into it. And it's obviously easier when it's not a "huge complicated immersive open world RPG" but just a first person puzzle game.\n\nThe core of the game is the puzzles, you use and place objects to get to a key that will help unlocking the future puzzles until the final one. And the mechanics are straightforward, a hacking tool that you place to deactivate an item, for exemple to open doors or immobilize dangerous "bomb bots" (lets call them that), a good old fashion box, a tool that helps you connect beam emitters to their receptors by directing the beam. Then later, fans to make objects move or float, recorders that splits you in two characters by recording your action during am interval, a plate that makes you a moving platform for this other you after you split. It might seem a bit complicated but those mechanics are introduced very slowly throughout the game and every single idea about how to use them is intuitively hinted in the puzzle. And it would be hard to make puzzles more intuitive than in this game, without taking your hand and removing the fun of solving it yourself. The game never explain something directly, but everything is though to help you figure it out, with the level design.\nSo that's it then, great mechanics introduced perfectly make this a great puzzle game ! Yeah, if you succeed at making the game deep enough (that also mean long enough) and interesting in more than one aspect to make you entertained and keep the fun alive.\n\nThat's the other big success of The Talos Principle, it's at least 15 to 20 hours long to make a near 100% run and I did not get bored. The game is challenging at some time, I'm happy that I finished it without any help, it's rewarding. But even when puzzle were a bit easy, hold on "shift" and speed run the puzzle like a champ. It's also rewarding to finish a puzzle game very quickly, that crazy sprint might seem like too much at the beginning but it's perfect once you master some mechanics to keep your actions almost as fast as your brain.\nNow, the mood of the game, while sublime graphical effects and an insane soundtrack might sound great, it would actually have distracted the player while he is solving puzzle. So the graphics feels simple, the music is calm, peaceful and quiet enough. The only distractions you have are between the puzzles, a character is talking to you from above (how original) and lead the scenario progression, the lore of the game is perfectly fit for its gameplay, there is audio logs to play and background text to read. Oh no, I'm not a fan of reading in a game, it makes me really bored and kills the mood and immersion in a game for me, I'm probably gonna miss out the whole lore by ignoring those text. Well, that's what I though, but "Nay" is the answer to that. It's well written, really fascinating for most of them and each is short enough so that you know you will finish reading each of them in no time. Rarely in a game I've been that much into the texts documents.\nIt's also thanks to the lore of the game that, while it has almost no character arcs or great details about a fantastic world you'll want to live in, is making you think a lot about ourselves. Ok, I'm sure people found those subjects and reflections very arrogant and pretentious, but if you really are curious about it, forget your boring high school philosophical classes and make yourself think and answer those subjects, it IS interesting and greatly introduced into the experience. You will start dialogs with the game you would not even believe. And so what we get from all this is a fully realized experience, with at is core a puzzle game for sure, but also an identity. It is the sort of game you could hardly imagine a sequel, it already is enough to himself.\n\nI will say this, I always had this thinking that to many developers don't realize all of what a game can be, and focus too much on certains obvious qualities that a game should have, while forgetting so many others. Few games are great in so many aspects and also take a chance at having something to say. And it is this kind of experience that you will remember.","March 4","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

You can predict the plot without too many problems, but there's still so much pleasure in taking part.\n\n-Puzzles are a mix of critical thinking and a lack of overthinking.  You learn how to properly switch between large-scale planning, and smaller-scale instinct for resolving puzzles that can either be large and complex or a series of small tasks.\n\n-Incredible philosophical discussion.  Note that I'm not saying "incredible philosophy".  The game likes to mess with your perspectives and make you question them regardless of what they may be.  The in-game conversations also provide insight into how to properly discuss a philosophical subject like consciousness (or show you that there might not be a proper way to have such dialogue).\n\n-Lots of exploring, contrary to how it may seem at first.  You just have to look around the maps and you glean most of the story this way.  They do reward you for looking around, you can only make complete sense of the events by exploring, sort of like how Bioshock has the audiotapes around.\n\n-Really great aesthetically, like beautiful.  Gameplay is incredibly smooth too.\n\n\nThe devs really went out of their ways to offer an incredible game with atmosphere that is UNIQUE to their own art style and writing.  The soundtrack is also pretty great too, doesn't overpower the game.  IMO this is one of the best games I've picked up in years.  $40 is actually worth it if you consider that it'll probably take you 30+ hours to beat, more likely 40+ if you do all the extra stuff in a very quick amount of time.  I left this review just because I felt the devs REALLY deserve as much praise as they could get for their work.  8/10.   Only thing that could be improved is that it could've been longer for the price they're offering, but at $10 it is a STEAL.","December 23, 2015","true","32.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lifeinstasis/recommended/257510/","lifeinstasis","Life in Stannis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lifeinstasis/","60 products in account","Man. I did not expect to love this game as much as I did.\n\nPros:\n- Great writing, well beyond what I've come to expect in modern games. Great story. Everything ties together so well.\n- Conversations are very dynamic and extremely personalized. How you get along with a particular NPC depends on the player. It allows for people of many different belief sets.\n- Puzzles are adequately challenging.\n- Beautiful design, great scenery in the game.\n- Never encountered any bugs. Game ran smoothly.\n- The little voice acting in this game is all extremely well done for what it is.\n\nCons:\n- Pacing is a little slow. There is a lot of story but it seems like you have to put in many hours of work to reach every new bit.\n- Not a fan of the 'hub world' design in which you walk into partitioned maps.\n- The game should have been a lot shorter.\n- The puzzles are almost insultingly easy at first, though they do become much harder.\n\nI went into this thing very critical. Almost immediately I was exhausted by the pretentious and blatantly self-indulgent philosophical musing. It was so heavy handed, and I imagined one of the designers was practically touching himself over getting license to write extensively on the topic and FINALLY be able to utilize his otherwise useless bachelor's in philosophy.\n\nHowever, as the game went on, things took a turn. The story became gripping and powerful. The philosophical spouting ebbed away and was replaced by real questions, real conversation, and growing sense of suspicion. I became desperate for every shred of story I was fed. Every time I found a new terminal, I hungrily read every new document. Because not all of them are about Greek philosophers and Bible passages. Many of them document the lives of the people who put you where you are. You learn who they were, what they were like, and what they were most afraid of.\n\nAnd god, it was just terrific. I did not expect to love this game. I didn't expect to become so emotionally invested in the story. I don't want to spoil anything, but the ending was better than I could have hoped. The storytelling is *incredibly* intuitive, smart, and artistic. They know how to tell a story without over- or under-telling it. The bits of text you glanced over in earlier in the game become very relevant later. Everything just ties together so damn well.\n\nEven the ENDING choices were inuitive. The most difficult ending to achieve may not be what you think (which in a game is refreshing, since usually you have to really commit to get anything positive). I watched a video of the same ending that I got, and it still differed because of the choices I'd made earlier.\n\nMy chief complaint about the game is that it runs a bit long. The puzzles become repetitive, and there are far too many of them. It suffers a lot, I'd say, from the same mistakes Assassin's Creed 1 made when it became overly formulaic and a bit boring.\n\nThe story and the writing, however, make it worth it. And in the end, the writing wasn't as pretentious as I thought it was. They knew exactly what they were doing, and they knew when it became unimportant to bother with pointless existentialist pondering.\n\nAnd of course I have to add that the aesthetic design of the game was absolutely gorgeous. I've never been compelled to take so many screenshots. I've never seen skies as beautiful in any other game.\n\nIf you started this game but got sick of the writing and put it down, reconsider. You won't regret reaching the end.","March 10","true","25.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The world is beautifully rendered, the music is superb, the puzzles are decently challenging (cannot speak to Road to Gehenna - haven't played it yet) and the backstory is well-written and well-presented and the voice acting is excellent. There is lots of philosophical discussion and questioning, so count that as a plus if you're into that kind of thing and a minus if you're not.\n\nMost puzzles have fairly linear solutions, so it becomes a matter of figuring out what you can do with the resources available to you. If there is one area that left me a bit disappointed, and I'll leave out two massively multi-mine puzzles that just left me frustrated, it is the repetitiveness. While each puzzle is clearly distinct, the sheer number of them and the mechanics of using the solution tools gets old after the 50th or 60th puzzle.\n\nExpect to spend 30-40 hours playing through the base game and a bit longer if you're going to try to grab all of the achievements (there is one tied to each of the three endings, so some replay will be necessary). It's well worth the purchase price (especially if you can catch it on sale) and you'll be thinking about the game long after you've finished it.","March 10","true","42.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Talos Principle is often compared to the Portal series, but that's primarily because they fall into roughly the same genre and they both involve AI. It would be like comparing Limbo to Super Mario Brothers because they're both side scrolling platformers that involve a male protagonist seeking after a female character. Otherwise these games are radically different in tone and style. Likewise I really like Portal, but for very different reasons; the mood is altogether different.\n\nI don't know how many games I've ever played that include quotes from everything from Aristotle to William Blake to G. K. Chesterton. The diversity of sources correlates well with the diversity of thought expressed thematically throughout. Through the events of the game, the slowly revealed backstory, and the numerous bits of literature and philosophy scattered about, the game leads you through a long deep musing on life, death, civilization, and the nature of consciousness. Yet, The Talos Principle never comes across (at least to me) as pretentious or smug. (The continuous focus on fun challenging puzzles might have something to do with maintaining an effective balance here.) There is definitely a coherent story with a very satisfying ending, but there's still a good bit of unanswered questions--in a good way. It muses more than it preaches, and through the course of the experience you are invited into that contemplation.\n\nI probably haven't said much more than has already been said, and any more words would continue to fail to express the wonder of this electronic piece of art, but it is truly fascinating, thought-provoking, inspiring, and simply entertaining. There's not much more I could ask for in a game.","July 30, 2015","true","149.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I skipped as much text data as possible and simply refused to debate with a computer terminal that didnt provide the responces I would have given.\n\nThis is NOT Mario\n\nJumping on objects is a MASSIVE annoyance , either let me jump on objects or dont.  Letting the player jump on the   surfaces you choose but not surfaces that you clearly should be able to jump on ???  Using the excuse that you are just exploiting the programs flaws to get Stars, Or the excuse that there are alternative solutions to text chambers ??\n\n2D or 3D ?\n\nIts VERY clear that all of the levels are designed from a 2D overhead view-point (as if designed with lego)  This game really lacked a Z-axis.\n\nWhy so Serious ??\n\nOk so this game is a binned version of Serious Sam that focuses on the Gameplay mechanics ,  But honestly I started to really wish that the game actually HAD a story and a shotgun.  Also I would have liked to have seen some decent comedy added , it doesnt have to rip off Portal, but the seriousness just made its Religious/Philisopical tone that more up its own butt","March 17","true","35.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What they're really worried about is that someone might prove, once and for all, that consciousness can arise from matter. And I kind of understand why they find it so terrifying. If we can create a sentient being, where does that leave the soul? Without mystery, how can we see ourselves as anything other than machines? And if we are machines, what hope do we have that death is not the end?\n\nWhat really scares people is not the artificial intelligence in the computer, but the "natural" intelligence they see in the mirror."\n\nIt really is as good as reviews say.

I would keep playing forever.\n\nI estimate I'm two thirds along the way. This is a great puzzle game. Almost as good as Portal 2. The puzzles are varied and well balanced (although they can get tedious at times if you rush the game like I'm doing - I really want to get more story), and the story is delivered at a good pace.\n\nThe story itself is well written, engaging and interesting. You will probably figure out what's going on halfway through the game, but there are enough open possibilities that you'll still want to explore further in order to confirm your theories.\n\nAnd speaking of exploration.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/donaldduck8/recommended/257510/","donaldduck8","Donald","http://steamcommunity.com/id/donaldduck8/","80 products in account","It is no secret that the video game market of today has become increasingly catered to the mainstream, action-oriented and rather simple-minded community. With franchises such as Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto and Just Cause celebrating record-breaking releases, we are bearing witness to a market specialization unparalleled in its current form, thanks to the video game industry's global reach. Given the circumstances, it is an utter miracle that a game as marvelous and hauntingly beautiful as The Talos Principle ever even came into existence. In fact, this game was originally supposed to be a continuation of the "Serious Sam" series, Croteam's age-old shooter that is possibly as dumbed-down as it gets. However, in the midst of developing the "intermissions" between each of the sections filled with a senselessly large amount of lead, explosions and mildly entertaining puns, Croteam were experimenting with a few puzzle elements. Designed to let the players cool off inbetween pretending to be Rambo and Duke Nukem, they were supposed to be nothing more than a sidekick, but ended up as much more than that. Sure enough, said puzzling elements resulted in an overwhelmingly positive response amongst the playtesters, captivating their attention for hours on end and essentially causing them to disregard the rest of the game's content. Croteam quickly realized the potential they had on their hands, and started over from scratch with nothing but the goal of creating the best puzzling experience to date in mind. And oh boy, did they deliver.\n\nThis unpredictable chain of events was the birth of "The Talos Principle", arguably the single best first-person puzzler ever made, leaving classics like the Portal series in the dust and building on the successes of other puzzlers such as The Swapper and Q.U.B.E. in the process. Armed with tricky puzzle mechanics, a beautiful setting and the sheer brilliant writing of Tom Jubert and Jonas Kyratzes, this game presents the pinnacle of all thoughtful gaming.\n\nBut let's start small, shall we? In essence, The Talos Principle consists of two distinguished forms of content: On the one hand, we have the puzzling experience. The player is quickly made familiar with several puzzle mechanics, with another few being introduced as the game progresses, and solves increasingly complicated set-ups throughout the game. As with any puzzle game, these range from the unavoidable one-step-to-solve introductory puzzles that are almost a nuisance to deal with, to the intermediate puzzles that, while a little more complicated, are unable to withstand a proper approach for long, ending with the mind-melting brainbreakers toward the end, which are clearly meant for the more astute among us. But such is not to say that a logical genius is needed to complete the game; While the puzzles make up almost the entirety of the game's playable content, only some are a necessity to complete. The Talos Principle handles the abundance of isolated content nicely, maintaining a proper sense of progression despite the game's free-will approach to what the player does, and what he does not. As such, both newcomers to the puzzling genre as well as established fans will thoroughly enjoy the puzzling experience The Talos Principle offers.\n\nBut this puzzling does not come on its own. It is paired with what is possibly the best writing ever to appear in any game, of any genre, of all time. Posing the work of ingenious modern thinkers Tom Jubert and Jonas Kyratzes, Croteam made a decision that turned this game from a nice, but bland, puzzler into an engulfing and elusive experience without comparison in the triple A world, smashing all of the expectations their pre-release sneak peeks had set for myself. And the expectations were sky high, after they had announced the writers behind the indie mega-success "The Swapper" and the ubiquitous flash game "The Infinite Ocean" would be working on this project. Both games deal with a plethora of philosophical thoughts in the neighbourhood of physical reductionism and nihilism, and have successfully approached the average gamer with thought experiments and realizations descended from intellectual behemoths, inspiring shower thoughts and sleepless nights over the most fundamental of questions. And yet, not only does The Talos Principle creatively reinvent what has been chewed through for millennia, it also succeeds in turning abstract philosophical concepts into something all of us can relate to, here and now. The storyline, like so many others, begins with the player being dropped into a world without any knowledge of the why, where, when or how. As more and more fragments of answers emerge, the player slowly uncovers their purpose in the game and is faced with fundamental problems in human thinking, all the while building up to an ultimate choice in which what the player has realized will come to the test. But the game does not just passively offer food for thought, the player is metaphorically pummeled with deep-reaching questions about purpose, existence, morality, qualia, and an innumerable amount of contradictions that you will undoubtedly fall victim to. But once again, one doesn't need to major in philosophy to appreciate the incredible work that has gone into this part of the game. The writing is simultaneously both aimed at the average human as well as the passionate thinkers, and will, without fail, stump even the best of us at times.\n\nAll of this would already be a pleasure to play by itself, but Croteam did not let up and perfected every last aspect of the experience they wanted to create. The Talos Principle comes with a beautiful soundtrack composed by musical genius Damjan Mravunac, who appears to possess universal expertise in all corners of sound design and production and has been around in the video game industry for about as long as I have been alive. The tracks perfectly accentuate the setting of the game, adding to the experience in all the right ways without taking away the player's attention from the puzzles or the thinking. Completely lacking percussion, the soundscape of The Talos Principle is incredibly soothing, and manages to hold its own as a standalone product that I find myself listening to again and again.\n\nIn short, The Talos Principle provides dozens of hours filled with puzzle-solving, realizations, questions, answers and general intellectual fun accompanied by a hauntingly serene score. The sheer amount of unique puzzles and extras, combined with the multiple layers of thinking that can be found inside the game, warrant not only a second, but even a third or a fourth playthrough of this magnificent beast.\n\nFrom me, The Talos Principle receives a perfect score. Croteam performed a herculean effort in introducing the puzzling genre to the triple A world, and succeeded marvelously in doing so. The game is an all-around coherent and polished experience that captures your attention from start to finish, and cleverly avoids the one-time-playability many puzzlers and thinking-games tend to suffer from. I recommend the game to anyone who appreciates putting their brain to good use every once in a while, as well as all of the DLC.","December 25, 2015","true","35.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"
