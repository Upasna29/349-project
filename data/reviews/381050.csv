But let's not be pedantic, and just try to review this as a GAME in its own right, eh?  Or, to be more specific, an Early Access game, which I'll say right off the bat this most definitely qualifies as.\n\nThe Ritual on Weylyn Island is far from finished.  Some sound effects are blatantly missing, for starters, and the aforementioned Store page clarifies that all we're getting at this point is the first three chapters out of six.  On the whole, though, it's perfectly playable, and far from "broken" from what I've experienced thus far.  What IS here, in any case, is looking awfully darned promising, especially if you're into all things witch-y and demonic, like I am.  This is some spooky stuff!  The sound design, while unfinished, is a particular standout, full of whispering voices telling you that they are coming for you and what-not, and while the graphics are nothing too spectacular, they're more than sufficient to create the desired effect.  The story is building up to be a good'un, the dialogue and voice acting is adequate if uninspired (and NOT in broken English, praise Satan!), and the gameplay is certainly solid.\n\nSo what exactly does the gameplay comprise of, you ask?  Well, thus far I'd describe it as somewhere between a first-person stealth-horror game (a la "Amnesia", et al) with elements of quick-time, narrative-based events not dissimilar to Telltale's "The Walking Dead" (push a table up to a wall, climb on the table to access a high window leading out of the basement to the world outside, and press "space" repeatedly to kick your demonically-possessed uncle in the head several times as he grabs your ankle and tries to prevent your escape...that kind of thing).  It's a very story-driven piece, in other words, but one which gets down to the nitty-gritty action nice 'n' quick, all things considered.  The Store page does describe the game as "combat-free", however, so I'd think it safe to say that you're unlikely to get your hands on a shotgun and go cultist-culling at any point in the game's narrative.  But if a story-driven horror-adventure with a fair dose of stealth and running away from enemies sounds good to you, this may well be one to consider.\n\nNow, before I continue, there is ONE thing I should probably mention.  I've apparently played up to the end of the first three chapters - the first HALF of the game, allegedly - and it only took me about an hour!  So, er, yeah...it's gonna be one of them SHORT games, unless chapters 4 to 6 turn out to be much longer and/or more challenging than the first three.  I know there's a bucketload of you people out there who object to paying decent money for such a short gaming experience - I'm not really one of you, but - should you be one of those people, you may wanna hold off for a substantial sale, even once the game's officially finished.\n\nAnd there ARE, of course, other risks involved with these "Early Access" propositions.  We horror game addicts have been burned one or two (or damn well near FIFTY) times in the past, so there's always the chance these devs are gonna go bust, or simply abandon their project because one of them decides their true calling in life is to become a lonely, God-fearin' pig farmer out in Kansas or somethin' (it happens).  But I can confidently report that this DOESN'T seem to be one of those scam-happy development "companies", which are in truth probably one or two nerdy young dudes locked in their bedrooms who take all their life lessons from GTA, and thereby believe that money = ♥♥♥♥♥es = the be-all and end-all of human existence, and art be ♥♥♥♥ED.  This one, on the other hand, seems genuine.  You can truly sense the LOVE in this one, and I don't mean in a hippy-dippy, Charlie Manson commune-y kinda way (nor is that the kinda love you're gonna get from the cult members you'll encounter in the game).\n\nFor now, consider my recommendation a somewhat reserved one, based on the fact that this is very much a work-in-progress which could go any-which-way at this stage.  Fingers crossed, I'll be increasing the below rating mere months from now.  If not, well, it won't be the first ten bucks I've ever wasted in the ever-unpredictable and oh-and-so magical land of Steam...such is life...\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10.\n\n(PS Nice to see a new horror game where your character isn't so borderline-asthmatic that they can't run more than five metres without stopping for breath.  Thank God some devs are reading reviews, and paying attention to which recent trends audiences AREN'T actually liking!)","August 8, 2015","true","1.6"," 36 of 49 people (73%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","73","36","49","10","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/381050/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","Overall, I quite enjoyed The Ritual on Weylyn Island. The game mixes itself up and comes off as a low-budget attempt to make an interesting sort of cinematic horror experience, one that has actual diversity in gameplay, setting, tasks, and knows how to pace itself and keep things interesting. A few scenes can even be startling or unnerving. This all comes with an edge of low-budget elements, including some wonky animations and a level of jank to things. However, the ambition and successful execution of many of its concepts makes it an enjoyable 1.5-2 hour experience to go through (appropriately about the length of a horror movie).\n\nThe basic idea is you play as a girl name Moira, who has come a bit after the rest of her family to Weylyn Island, an island her rich grandfather had purchased and passes down to his family upon his death (along with his riches and possessions). They go to stake claim to the place, and to help strengthen some family ties that have grown a bit distant recently. However, a strange cult has invaded the island, and now seem to want the family dead. And thus, it becomes a tiresome night of having to evade cultists, ritualistic shrines, and discover what exactly is going on here.\n\nAnd it mostly succeeds. In big part due to it being able to keep the player guessing, a variety of settings, tasks, and solid core mechanics, matched with feeling involved in every moment of the action going on. Whether it be exploring the quiet coast of the island, evading a silent stalker in a basement, or investigating a strange altar with a music box, the game is full of interesting scenes matched with good atmosphere and a level of intrigue accomplished by good vision and direction.\n\nThere are a few flaws here; The story is predictable as all hell, the finale while not quite disappointing feels like it could be more. While the game is worth playing through to the end, I feel the first half of the game was better fleshed-out and realized, with the second half feeling a bit more linear and sometimes coming off as more scripted. A few areas do feel they could be tighter designed, such as a scene where you're in a house looking for a key and something is banging on the door, but no matter how long you take the door will just keep banging, smudging much of the tension there. But even despite all of this, there is a very solid little horror experience in this title. The length might put some off, but it doesn't feel they padded the game to make it longer and do keep the variety and overall quality at a higher-than-average aspect to indie horror developers. In some ways, it feels like maybe their ambition was a bit over their heads, but for this to be a mostly well-realized vision is quite an accomplishment.\n\nBut I point out these flaws as I feel the game itself is quite solid. Not the best horror game I've played, but a pretty well-done foray with a few interesting twists and turns up its sleeves to keep the 1.5-2 hour experience interesting. It's also notable the game avoids many indie horror pitfalls; the game has a good level of darkness (you never can't see what's going on and it looks like its night rather than pitch dark), your flashlight has no batteries and is actually quite efficient, there is no limited sprinting, it doesn't rely on jump scares, there isn't much in the way of key collecting, it doesn't come off as a clone of any popular indie horror game and there's no clone segments designed after Slender or FNAF or something (this comparison isn't the best, but the thing I find myself comparing it the closest to would be Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth, which it reminded me a bit of), the writing is good and isn't full of typos and grammar mistakes, the voice acting is pretty decent, among other things. But it doesn't accomplish it goals because of it not failing, it is a competent and often engaging journey on its own.\n\nIf you like cult horror (as in, literally about cults and figuratively), indie horror games with a lot of heart, don't mind a low-budgeted game with deep ambitions, and overall don't mind the price tag to the hours it might provide of entertainment, I say definitely worth checking out.","December 4, 2015","true","2.8"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","27","34","2","4"

Cult plots are usually too saturated in cheese to grind any fear from but the game establishes their brutality early as you arrive at a family residence to find blood, broken glass, defaced pictures and arcane graffiti. Your first encounter with the invaders is similarly unsettling; fleeing through a dense wood, you veer off onto narrow branching paths, forced to suddenly retreat as you almost run into the outstretched hands of robed figures.\nThere's no combat to speak of, aside from a QTE, and the best thing TROWI could do is keep it that way. This isn't a difficult game; there are no puzzles beyond figuring out which box to barricade a door with but it is the engaging equivalent of a walk through a haunted house.\nApart from the tightening up of interaction UI and some unfinished sound cues, my advice to the developers is mainly plot orientated. I'd ditch the opening cutscene. It looks like crap and acheives nothing. Tighten up the dialogue. Keep the cult in the shadows. I could really have done without the demonically possessed family members hissing and swearing; I think the atmosphere is better served by the hooded cultists but if they have to stay, keep their mouths shut.\nDefinitely heading in the right direction.

However, due to poor presentation, an unfulfilled story, and hollow characters, Weylyn Island stumbles and falls before it can provide the homage it strives to represent.\n\nYou play as Moria Weylyn; a typical collage girl without any defining traits or skills. Her grandfather had recently died, and in his will, Moria and a handful of family members are given the isolated island he once called home; Blessed Island. (Odd, seeing as how the game’s title is Weylyn Island, yet it’s clearly called Blessed Island throughout the story. But I digress.)\n\nThese family members include: Uncle Brian, his two kids, Fin and Megan, and Moria’s older sister, Row. Plans were made to meet up on the island, but a freak storm delays Moria’s trip. Arriving one day after her family, she sets foot on the cold, wet dwarf and heads out.\n\nIn all honesty, Weylyn Island starts out really strong. The Island’s dark and laced in shadows, and your first few minutes are spent soaking up the atmosphere. I mean, you’ve got a bunch of unsuspecting teens (and one adult) on a secluded, creepy island. The possibilities are endless! Your first real objective is to head up to the old cabin, where your family is supposedly waiting for you. As I trudged down the trailside, bombarded by endless rain, I could only imagine what sort of horrors awaited me.\n\nSadly, that’s about the extent of this game’s suspense and intrigue.\n\nBefore going any further, we might as well talk graphics. And they’re… alright. I mean, Weylyn Island isn’t ugly by any stretch of the word, but its design is easily forgettable. The grey, overbearing tone works wonders at first, building upon the mood of the setting. But endless rain, pine trees and monochrome color pallets only go so far. Again, this game’s level design isn’t bad, but only decent. As for character models… well, that’s another story.\n\nTheir textures are basic at best and look far from appealing, but they manage. But it’s their animations that really bite the dust; everyone walks like they’ve got a wooden plank shoved up their ♥♥♥.\n\nBut let’s be real: you don’t need high budget visuals or picturesque designs to make something scary. If done correctly, a game with ugly graphics can be forgiven if its got a solid story and solid gameplay. I mean, a build up with this much potential is sure to lead to something good, right?\n\nRight…?\n\nAs for gameplay, there’s little to speak of. Long bouts of walking and quick-time-events are in high abundance, topped off with not-so-scary chase scenes, and most of these are void of sound effects or tracks. The results are less intense and more uncomfortable (and no, not in a good way).\n\nBut despite all of this, it’s Weylyn Island’s story that ruined the entire game for me. Hell, I could forgive all these flaws had the plot been (at least) good.\n\nBut nope, it isn’t. I won’t spoil anything, but it’s got everything required to tell a lame horror story. There’s practically zero explanation until the third act, which left me more confused and less terrified most of the time. Some of these characters don’t even ♥♥♥♥ing talk! We’re watching them suffer and die but… why should I care?  One of them had little more than two lines of dialogue, and another was only capable of squealing and whining. Jesus, one of them didn’t get a chance to talk before kicking the bucket!  All of their voice actors were terrible, especially your character’s. I’ve seen sloths with more dedication than this ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe game also thinks that long sessions of poetry recited by old men is scary. It isn't. This is Weylyn Island’s #1 method of storytelling, and it’s done awfully.\n\nThis game just makes me mad. God, it’s even forced me to type up my longest review yet. But when a story with so much possibility fails to strike almost every note, it just leaves me baffled. “What went wrong,” I think to myself. “What. Went . Wrong?”","January 3","false","1.9"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","14","21","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/harshlycritical/recommended/381050/","harshlycritical","HarshlyCritical","http://steamcommunity.com/id/harshlycritical/","444 products in account","Most indie horror games on Steam that are/were in early access tend to be riddled with incompetent gameplay, feature underwhelming length and show poor execution all around. Fortunately, The Ritual on Weylyn Island only suffers from one of those problems.\n\nWith a current price tag of $9.99, "Ritual" offers only about 90 minutes of game. There is no replay value - the single collectible in the game is always in plain sight, and there is only one ending. Despite those shortcomings, I find myself recommending this game purely from the enjoyable experience those 90 minutes were.\n\n"Ritual" is an ambitious game for one of its budget and staff size. There are cutscenes, facial animations, QTEs and chase sequences. There is an overall cinematic appreciation that's missing from its "find a key to open a door to find another key" indie horror peers, and that's what sets it apart.\n\nIt isn't without its faults, of course. The voice acting quality is spotty, some animations are a bit limp, and the locations you visit often feel too empy. The presentation, while well-meaning and generally well-executed, feels "off" from time to time due to these limitations, but those limitations give it a certain charm that I find refreshing. And it sure beats the hell out of many of the bug-ridden horror snoozefests being sold on this platform.\n\n"Ritual" won't make any horror GOTY lists, but I would be lying if I said I didn't get off this 90-minute ride with a smile on my face.","January 10","true","1.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

That means that there’s a lot of great art house style games available to buy but there is a lot of utter crap that gets published. Separating the strong from the weak isn’t always the easiest in this genre because the worst often gets heavy promotion while the good, solid, titles often get ignored. The Ritual on Weylyn Island is a game that is likely to be ignored despite it being a very solid and reasonable entry into a crowded marketplace.\n\nSuitable graphics but a couple of minor letdowns: This is a game that does not rely on its graphics to tell the story. However, what is there helps establish the atmosphere very well. It’s color palette was extremely well chosen. It is gloomy, foreboding, etc. It is everything that you would expect a horror story located on an isolated island to be. There are a few letdowns graphically as occasionally the particular thing you need to go to isn’t very clear. For example, there is a part where you need to find a trap door in a room in order to progress through to the next stage of the story. I searched that room several times and couldn’t find anything and thus I googled the solution and a found a video that showed me where it was.  I’d also have appreciated a little bit more work into the character design. They’re not anyone that you’re going to remember after you’ve played the game art wise.\n\nInconsistent voice work: I must admit that I watched the Jim Sterling video on this game prior to playing. He pointed out that the voice over work occasionally sounds like it was made in two different rooms. I agree with him. The level is wildly inconsistent throughout but as he said that’s indie games for you. It’s a minor quibble but it is noticeable. I must admit that I loved the voice recording tapes that you find throughout the game. They add a tremendous amount of backstory to the game and are generally always found at just the right point of the game to make the most impact.\n\nEnjoyable but cliche-ish story: If you’ve read your fair share of horror stories you’re bound to have come across a story similar to The Ritual on Weylyn Island. That’s not necessarily a bad thing but don’t expect the title to add anything new story wise to the genre. It’s very cliche-ish.\n\nBut I really enjoyed it: A few of the above points may sound as though I really didn’t appreciate the game yet I found that I did enjoy it. I’ve played a few horror games since I played the horror game of the year of 2015 in the PlayStation 4’s Until Dawn. Although there’s a gulf between the quality of that title and The Ritual on Weylyn Island I just have to suggest that this is a title that I will be returning to at some point with friends.\n\nThe Ritual on Weylyn Island is a very solid indie horror game. I believe that it belongs as a solid entry in a Halloween celebration gameathon. It holds its own against other horror games on Steam and is well and truly worthy of the two hours that it will take you to play through it. Consider it a B-grade movie. It’s far from trash but doesn’t have the production value of the very best titles.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 17","true","1.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Set on an island that the main character and her family have just inherited from the recently deceased grandfather. You are the last to arrive by ferry and find the family has gone up to the lighthouse.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ywiPFpMyxfg\n\nThe gameplay is a simple interactive first person game. You control the main character and are searching for your family and what the deal is on the island. The story so far has me hooked. The game opens with a cinematic of a man running through the woods, tripping into the center of a ritual circle made of stone. Several hooded figures start to chant loudly. A large man wearing some kind of mask stabs the man in the chest with a sword. Badass opening right?\n\nYou then arrive at a cabin in the woods and are told by the captain of the ferry how he's heard "stories" about the island that he doesn't wish to repeat. Well, screw you buddy. The character you are playing indicated they haven't been there since they were 8. So clearly I don't know these stories and furthermore, if they are so messed up why the hell wouldn't you tell the young lady you're dropping off at night. On an island. Alone.\n\nFrom here you read a note indicating the family is at the lighthouse and you should make your way there. Inside you find a flashlight and a tape recorded message from your creepy grandfather being cryptic about the island.\n\nThe story is interesting to me and I'd love to know what is happening on the island. However, some of the gameplay needs tuning. There was a part where you must left and right mouse click to pull yourself across a rope bridge. It was pretty lengthy and slow. The game is also voice acted which I enjoy from my horror games. The problem is some of it is poorly recorded and mixed. There were times when the audio would get so loud I had to take my headphones off, which is a bummer. It also sounded as if some of it was recorded in a bathroom, or at the beach. All this I think can and will be fixed over time so for me, no big deal.\n\nI'm just interested in the story here, as it's a scary story being told via first person I don't really need any fancy puzzles or gunfights. I like the idea of listening to audio logs, running from monsters, and creeping through the woods with a flashlight. Am I going to play it more than once? Maybe, I don't generally re-watch many horror movies either. As long as the story continues to be scary and well told, I'm in.\n\nFor more reviews and the podcast check out - EarlyAccessMedia.com and YouTube.com/EarlyAccessPodcast","August 15, 2015","true","1.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","6","10","3","1"

The voice acting is surprisingly decent for an indie developer and the story has a lot of potential. The controls are a little clunky and the lack of an options menu for anything is a tad dissapointing, especially when it comes to gamma settings (I never really found a need for the flashlight in my game play).\n\nThe game is supposedly stealth based, but the linear layout, invisible walls and enemies that tend to move faster than you make the stealth next to useless. This is a shame, I would love to have stealth work properly in this and have tried to in some area, but the enemies seem to know where you are at any given time as long as your in range. The best option is to just run past them, even if you get hit, it doesn't seem to do much which takes away from the hectic feel that a horror game should have.\n\nOn a plus side, the graphics aren't bad, infact they remind me very much of Vampie: The Masquerade, and the cut scenes are very smooth.\n\nThe story is probably the games strongest point in my personal opinion. It's very reminiscent of a B movie, much in the same way as Evil Dead (the original), the Wickerman, and so on. All of which I really enjoy.\n\nWould I recommend this game currently? Thats a toss up. The developers seem active and want feedback, the game itself isn't much, and it does have a lot of potential for a very nice finished game. There are lots of bugs still in the game, nothing overly concerning and most of them seem silly if anything. In the end the choice is yours to make. As for me, I'm glad for the purchase and look forward to seeing it polished into the gem it could be.","October 14, 2015","true","1.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","4","9","3","0"

Cultists on the island where your family is gathering to mourn the passing of an estranged grandfather? An interesting idea. As good an idea as it is, the game really falls short of being able to call this a game. Gameplay aspects were straight forward, though the picking up triggers could be a little touchy. The actual story was pretty lacking in really making this feel like a game. It sort of was more akin to a slight quicktime-ish event walking simulator. It had a great concept, but it just didn't really get pulled off in a satisfying way.","December 7, 2015","false","1.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I liked the story and the voice acting.The graphics looks great, I liked listening to the cassette tapes while running to next location.

But this was actually quite smooth to play. You play Moira who's grandfather has just passed and find yourself on his island to inherit the last of his belongings with the rest of your family. The visuals are on par with what you'd expect. Better looking than most Unity based games I've played recently. The voice acting isn't FANTASTIC but it's enough for immersion. Note that when the game states it's "combat-free" this may be a little misleading. As you can't actively engage enemies, there are some QTE-style situations you'll have to deal with. The game also plays fairly casually, the hardest puzzles you'll have to solve are finding keys and barricading doors. I played about a half hour of the game, and was able to cut the gameplay down to 19 minutes. If you want a quick skim to see what you're in for check this out.\n\nWARNING: Language/NSFW https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh8HmxOOjsI","August 15, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

To simplify I have split my review into four sections; Gameplay, Graphics, Audio, and General.\n\nGameplay:\nTROWI is a dark horror driven game, I personally enjoy the themes of Witchcraft and Satanic Rituals.  There is no combat in this game and I believe that to be a good approach stylistically.  The inability to fight the enemy adds to the overall fear and adrenaline one feels while playing, knowing your only option is to run leaves you with a slight feeling of anxiety.    Adding to this anxiety is the fact that appropriately you are not given obvious direction, giving a feeling of being lost and frightened.\nFurthering to the fear aspect is the design of the witches, I find their distorted faces to be particularly disturbing.  They are quite unique and a positive artistic approach in my opinion.\nI experienced some minor problems while playing.  First is that the flashlight indicates that it can be turned on with both the F-Key and with a right mouse click, however I found it did not turn on with a right click.  I also found it somewhat odd that between each chapter the flashlight would turn off and I would have to turn it back on.\nI discovered a minor error with crouching.  If one crouches while stationary they cannot move while crouched, I was only able to move while crouching if I was already in motion.\nThe last problems I experienced were both at the pull-bridge.  The first is simply that when you reach the end of the pull bridge the transition from the bridge to the ground seemed somewhat awkward and unconnected, but perhaps that is to critical.  However after crossing the Pull bridge I discovered that your cousin Meghan became stuck and ran in place.  This was particularily bothersome as she is directly in your path and the only way past her is by jumping over her.  She did become unstuck, but I believe this error should be looked into.\nthe problems I experienced were all minor and did not take away from the overall feel or fun of the game, so I will give the Gameplay 7/10.\n\nGraphics:\nOverall the Graphics were smooth and an effective expression of the dark atmosphere of the Game.  I found character movement to be quite fluid for the main character, and the motion of enemies and npc's to be generally natural as well.  I particularly like the fact that you can see your own characters legs, this is an extremely rare effect in first person games and it worked well.  Leg movement was natural and well done and that left me impressed.\nTo contrast the positive effect of your legs I would like to point out that to me the way Moira raises her hand when passing through obstacles seems unnatural and somewhat sluggish.\nI enjoyed the water visuals, I found myself admiring the graphics while crossing a bridge early in the game, I also feel that the forest, trees and paths are very well done and added to the atmosphere.\nSome things I would like to point out however mostly centered around your Grandpa's house.  I found that the glass on the floor of the kitchen flickered on and off as you moved, a small bug.\nThe mirror effects in the first bathroom I feel needed work, as it looks more like an abstract painting than broken glass.  I would have loved to see any kind of reflection graphic, even through a broken mirror.\nThe next thing I would like to point out is the oddness of fluids other than bodies of water, Moira's Grandpa appears to have a jar of solidified camoflauge colored alcohol in his dining room.  Also later in the story when you reach the building that connects to the light house, there is a skeleton in a bathtub filled with what appears to be  jam, lol.\nUpon first viewing the light house you are given a short clip of the rotating light, overall the effect was well done, however the leaves on the trees seem to pop into existence unnaturally when bathed in light.\nOne last silly thing I would like to adress is the appearance of crows over the pull-bridge. They seem to warp in and out of existence. Either this is from the witches "black magic"  or it is simply an incomplete graphic. However I will also add it is barely noticeable.\nGenerally the graphics were quite well done for a game of this size, and any small quirks did not effect the atmosphere much or take away from the artistic direction. I would give the graphics a 7/10.\n\nAudio:\nWhile first approaching the island one of the first sound effects you hear is the rain and waves. I was impressed with both of these effects and their authentic sound. The transition of the effect between being outside and inside is smooth and well done, and the effect of rain drumming on the roof is a nice touch.\nOther sound effects that I appreciated were those of the frogs when passing by a small body of water, they were natural sounding and added to the effect of the forests ambience, I only wish there were more effects like this to make the forest come alive so-to-speak.  At one point there were crows crying from the trees, this effect started off well enough, but quickly became cluttered and unnatural, followed by a sudden stop in the audio instead of a more natural fading effect. I would even suggest having the effect of flapping wings indicating they were startled and all flew away.\nThe whispering of the witches while navigating the early parts of the forest were creepy and well done, however when they repeat the same phrase 3-4 times in a row it immediately became humourus instead of frightening.\nThe voice acting of the game is a bit of a let down. Moira's voice from start to finish has a reverberation that makes the voice feel very disconnected from the character, almost as if it were playing from her cassette player.  I believe this originates from the recording process and is the result of either distance from the microphone, or recording levels were not set appropriately in advance.  Regardless of where this effect originates, every time Moira spoke I was imagining the voice actor speaking into a microphone instead of the character actually speaking herself.\nIn general I must say the voice acting felt quite unnatural, as if it were read directly off of a paper.\nThere was an obvious crackling during the scene where the man was lit on fire, and all the audio surrounding that scene felt quite weak.  I personally feel that when dealing with emotions such a fear, the uninspired audio and lack of heart did in fact take away from the overal feel of the game.\nOnly adding to the mediocre voice acting was the uninspired music, where only simple bass notes were used during jump scares.\nIn light of the audio's strengths and weaknesses I will give it a 5/10\n\nGenral:\nSome things that caught my attention, I will not rate this section as not all of them need a fix, or are irrelevant. The first thing that I found strange was that Moira's Grandpa had one and a half bathrooms on the main floor, but only one bedroom, either he suffers from extreme intense diahrea or this is a design flaw.  Perhaps he suffers from gastric distress because in his cellar he appears to have jar upon jar of pickled lettuce. "C'mon gramps, you have plenty of space, how about making a garden?"\nThe other oddity I noticed were barrels  scattered all around the forest, what's in these barrels is a mystery. It is possible they are filled with gas, but it seems like overkill considering there is only one generator and one truck.\nSpeaking to the crashed truck, I also find it odd that there are far more barrels around the forest than the truck could hold.  Suggesting that the driver did not drop barrels because of fear, but instead that he is a drunk who drives haphazzardly everywhere he goes, dumping barrels around the forest as he pleases.\n\nCoclusion\nOverall I enjoyed this game, anything negative I wrote is in hopes that they can be fixed before the official release. I would give this title 7/10 and definitely recommend it to my friends. Great work Zema =)","October 2, 2015","true","5.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

It is part exploration and part walking simulator. You get to explore areas but much of it is on a linear path. I enjoyed this and it kept the story moving.\n\nI saw a YouTube Let's Play of the first level when it was still in development  (thanks Jim Sterling!) and patiently waited until the game was complete before buying.  I am a fan of creepy horror movies  (not just slashers) that build an atmosphere with sound and visuals and tell a tale. The atmosphere built nicely in this game and the forest sections had the hair on the back of my neck standing up a couple of times. This game cost me about $5 and I feel it was well worth the price of admission. I have certainly paid more for less with other games and other movies. If there was a follow up  product I would get it and that means I would have to recommend it.","March 15","true","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game refuses to even find its own executable file unless the customer manually fixes this problem by running the game as an administrator. Even then, the main character cannot be controlled and the camera endlessly spins around, mixed with a low FOV causes headaches and nausea. The graphics options barely exist, no sensitivity control or true controller support. Whilst the game supports unlocked resolution and framerate the game does not take advantage of these, and in fact, help its own demise. I do not think the developers anticipate people playing above a refresh rate of 60 since the game logic and animations appear to be tied to the framerate.\n\nThe game itself, the few minutes I spent with this nightmare: unskippable cutscenes, terrible terrible voice acting, low graphic fedelity with no artistic vision to back it up, generally feels unpolished and uncared for.\n\nI do not recommend this absolute buggy, horrible, terrible piece of crap as it stands right now because it's unplayable and not fit for consuming.","December 5, 2015","false","0.3"," 9 of 23 people (39%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","39","9","23","6","0"
