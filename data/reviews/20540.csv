We played the usual thing middle schoolers played like Call of Duty and some free to play games. One day, one of us had enough money to buy 3 copies of Company of Heroes which was a game none of us heard about but were interested in. For the entirety of 8th grade we played this game religiously. I have so many good memories from this wonderfully made RTS that there is no way I can write a bad review. This game is a perfect 10/10 with a 20/10 for the abundance of mods that exist for it. There are mods for Modern Warfare (Not the COD game, but a conflict between China and U.S.A) with it's own campaign, mods that expand upon existing units and vastly expand the possibilities of the game, mods that feature the Eastern front (USSR vs. Germany), mods that feature the war in Africa, Italy, and Japan, and many, many, many more. This game is a thing of beauty.","October 5, 2014","true","106.2"," 126 of 132 people (95%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","95","126","132","8","5"

See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor is a real-time strategy game developed by Relic Entertainment and published by THQ (RIP). This game serves as the second official expansion pack to the series which adds new game types that focuses on micro-management of either a single or small unit sizes, new 'Direct Fire' ability, new mini-campaigns which rewards you with alternate unit models for certain factions and fun new multiplayer modes.\n\nThe expansion pack 'Tales of Valor' gives the players three new mini-campaigns. The first one is 'Tiger Ace' which lets the players control a rampaging Tiger I Tank in a small town. The story follows the exploits of Majorgeneral Voss (character from Opposing Fronts) and Hauptmann Schultz (main antagonist of the first game). The second mini-mission is 'Causeway' where the player takes command of a group of paratroopers of the 86nd Air Division in their efforts to secure and hold the La Fiere Causeway which was being used by Allied forces to pass through the Normandy beaches. The last and final mini-mission is 'Falaise Pocket' where the player controls a renegade SS Panzergrenadiers and Wehrmacht soldiers who were ordered to evacuate but defied High Command in order to hold off advancing allied forces and give time for retreating German troops to escape.\n\nPROS:+ New missions are fun to play\n+ New units looks nice but... (See CON # 2)\n+ New and fun multiplayer game modes like 'Stonewall'\n+ Micromanagement gameplay (specially with the 'Tiger Ace' mission) was very fun\n+ 'Falaise Pocket' mission was extreme\n+ Artwork cutscenes were nice and complemented with good voice acting\n\nCONS:- No new armies or units\n- Some new units are just skin replacements\n- Mini-campaigns can be completed in a few hours for all three missions (I didn't expect it to be as long as the original campaign or as long as the Opposing Fronts campaign but I didn't imagine that it was this short)\n- The 'Directed Fire' feature is very hard to use and is implemented badly\n- Tried to do Stealth missions which were implemented (just like the above CON) badly\n- This expansion feels rushed\n\nCONCLUSION:Much like a Sherman to a Tiger Tank, this expansion is vastly inferior to the other games. It has its moments with some really intense battles particularly the 'Falaise Pocket' campaign, interesting new game mechanics from 'Tiger Ace' and cool looking replacement units but in the end, it doesn't really add anything innovative to the title. Playing through the campaign missions will leave players feeling that this expansion was rushed and released prematurely.\n\nNormally I would give this expansion a 'Not Recommended' rating but since a 'Complete Pack' exists I highly advice that you buy the aforementioned pack to have the full Company of Heroes 1 experience.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

If you are interested in this game and haven't bought it yet, let me just sum up all the things which make Company of Heroes so superb:\n\n+ thrilling campaign with cinematic cutscenes\n+ insane multiplayer battles where even a certain loss can be turned into a surprising victory\n+ unique resource system that forces you to play aggressively and fight across an entire map\n+ completely destroyable environment and sophisticated physics system\n+ very detailed graphics compared to other RTS games\n\nWith that being said, one could think CoH is almost a perfect game. It indeed is, but there is also a couple of things that sometimes make the game a bit frustrating:\n\n- vehicle pathing. Especially in urban maps with lots of buildings. obstacles, etc.\n- cheating AI. Yes, computer player cheats which means it can see the exact locations of all your units at all times as well as your building queues. Additionally, it can also use some abilities in ways human players can't.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Go get the game if you haven't yet! It's definetely worth the money and it still has a lot to offer, even today.\n\n9/10","March 29, 2014","true","0.2"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","30","33","0","0"

The second add-on to one of best real-time strategy games of all time. Intense, beautiful, and very amazing. The Game follows the stories of individuals from both sides as they fight in the Battle of Normandy. This add-on, does not have the average long campaign stories. But three short, but very good stories. Two German and One American. Either you are a German Tiger Ace batting British Tanks, and German Luftwaffe Ground Unit trying to defend the evacuation of the Faliase Gap, or a small band of members of the 82nd Airborne Division trying to hold a key road from a German counter-attack on D-Day.

This was also made by the masters of RTS, Relic Entertainment.\nTales of Valor offers three short campaigns all consisting of three missions each (Two German, One American) The campaigns are well thought through and are very enjoyable, also you get three brand new Skirmish modes (Stonewall, Panzerkrieg and Assault) And a ton of maps some good and some bad depending on your playstyle and new uints for completing the campaigns!\n\nPanzerkrieg is Similar to Assault, with the "Hero" units being replaced by tanks. The Axis Team can procure 3 tanks: the Hotchkiss, a small mobile tank hunter, the Panzer IV, the all-around tank, and the Panther tank, which specialize in head-on armor conflicts. The Allies have the M18 Hellcat, a mobile tank hunter, a Sherman tank that is meant to counter the Panzer IV, and the Churchill tank, which is the answer to the Panther.\n\nStonewall is were players are the defenders of a small town, defending against 16 waves of enemy attacks. Allies players face waves of Axis attacks progressing from a small band of Volksgrenadier to the mighty Tiger tanks. Axis players defend against waves ranging from Riflemen to M26 Pershing tanks. There are always four critical buildings in the town: the Church, that automatically heals units next to it, the Garage that repairs all allies' vehicles, the bank that gives a boost in manpower, and finally the Manor that gives an increase in population cap.\n\nAssault is were you choose one of seven heroes "Heroes" each different in their Offensive, Defensive, and Support abilities. Ranging from a Pioneer/Engineer to Paratroopers/Recon, the goal of the game is to destroy the enemy's base, which requires the player to fight through three separate lines of defenses. Protected by mortar firing bunkers, these also act as the Player Respawn point. By destroying each bunker the player is able to progress closer towards the enemy headquarters. Once the gas tanks inside a base has been blown, the team that destroyed them wins and the game ends.\n\nOverall the content you get in this small package is good and toatally worth it (New gamemodes, new units, new maps and three short campaigns) Only con is that they did not add a new army like the Free French forces etc. (I also recomend buying Opposing Fronts with this or just buying the Complete Collection)\nGame gets an 7 from Hen","January 7, 2015","true","19.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_aY/recommended/20540/","the_aY","the_aY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_aY/","141 products in account","The entire Company of Heroes collection is a great RTS, especially for those who traditionally don't like to play this genre of game due to the punishing difficulty on new players (seen in the big name ones, like StarCraft). The fact that this is a World War 2 setting will also draw out some people to try the game out.\n\nCoH doesn't have you building your base and gathering resources, rather it has you capturing points on the maps which provide you with increased resources and army capacity. This lets you worry more about managing position on the battlefield, rather than managing how many drones you have collecting resources. As you play more, you will see little nuances of the game that make the game deeper and more complex, like cover behind walls, flanking, and all the sorts of things you may expect from playing an in-depth, turn-based, strategy game.\n\nOverall, the CoH collection of games have a great single player campaign experience, and a thriving multiplayer community. If you like real-world settings for war, this RTS is probably for you.\n\nTales of Valor has a much weaker single-player experience than the previous entries. It's really just more of the same, but with a bit taken out. Regardless, it is still worthwhile to have if you are a CoH fan.\n\n6/10 "Okay"","January 11","true","0.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","0"

It's an RTS that does a lot of things differently from the Starcraft/C&C crowd, with brilliant new ideas that make for excellent gameplay. It is, bar none, my favorite RTS of all time.\nResource income is based on control of territory sectors distributed all over the map. Your economy hinges on being proactive and willing to fight to push the front line forward. Turtling in your base is effectively forfeiting the match.\nCombat is more nuanced -- less about reflexes and more about tactics. Reading the terrain and making use of environmental cover is a vital skill. Flanking, formations, suppression, combined-arms assaults... very few of these concepts matter in most RTS games of today, but they're all here and all important components of victory in CoH.\nI don't know if this game is ever going on sale again, but if you have money to spend, get this game. You'll get a fresh, masterfully-crafted experience, and countless hours of fun in online matches alongside, or against, your friends.","June 9, 2013","true",""," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Set during the invasion of Normandy toward the end of the war, Company of Heroes takes its cues from Saving Private Ryan, by portraying both the sheer brutality of the war as well as the humanity of its combatants. Many other recent WWII games have also drawn influence from Steven Spielberg's landmark film, but Company of Heroes is even more graphic. This and the game's highly authentic-looking presentation are its distinguishing features, and it boasts some frantic, well-designed strategic and tactical combat to match. Company of Heroes trades a wide breadth of content for an extremely detailed look at WWII-era ground combat, and its action is so fast paced that it's best suited for the reflexes of an experienced RTS player.

However, the vast majority of gameplay concepts and mechanisms have been perfected to such a level that you will not regret your purchase.\n\nI am a big fan of WW2 history and I have always wanted a real-time strategy game that would allow me to master combined arms tactics which were developed during WW2. The game has a wide variety of units including but not limited to infantry, tanks, mobile artillery, mortar and light armored vehicles. In order to defeat your enemy, you will have to use a combined arms approach that integrates all of these units. You won't be able to steam roll through the enemy lines with a single Tiger tank as it would get torn to shreds by Bazooka-wielding infantry units.\n\nOverall, I must say Relic has created a true gem for all WW2 game fans.

It has so much micro-managing that I had to let go of some keys while playing to assign the 0 to a specialized squad. I love the fast paced combat in annihilation but Conquest or "Victory points" will forever be my favorite in COH. After playing these games thanks to the Humble THQ Bundle, I can surely say I am addicted and I will be getting COH2, hopefully it will happen unlike my other favorite strategy -- Generals 2 which got cancelled only to make a... F2P strategy game.\n\nThat asside - COH is a great game with many pros and little cons. The bots can be kind of hard to manage both on the enemy team and yours. For instance, we had our friend leave last night and his bot made the biggest army that I've ever seen in RTS game until now... they did nothing at all and since there are 3 types of beacons, each for "Attack", "Defend" and "Capture", the only way I could signal my Not-NPC player was by beaconing him the attack here and then quickly changing to the bot doing something but he doesn't do it all the time. Bottom point though, the game uses interesting mechanics and I like what I see from it, I am only sad I was stubborn not to download it through out the years when these Standalone expansions and the game were released..","December 26, 2012","true","13.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

There are no new factions. There are no new, extensive campaigns. The expansion adds only three short, unfulfilling campaigns, some new multiplayer units (these replace other units normally in the game), and a few new multiplayer modes. The campaigns are not very fun. They entail taking control of a small number of absurdly overpowered units to play a highly unrealistic set of missions. The new units in multiplayer are generally less useful than the units they replace, so it's best to simply not use most of them. The survival multiplayer mode is fun, but it is not worth the purchase price of the game.\n\nThis expansion sometimes goes on sale for $2.50. If you're going to buy it, buy it at that price.

There is little base building in many of the missions, and I absolutely HATE these sorts of missions. Instead of micromanaging a army, you are largely micromanaging one or two guys.

Depending on future sales, it may be worth a look if you are a company of heroes fan.\n\nMy main beef with this is the length of the campaigns.  You will see that I have played this game for 3 hours, which is the total length of time it has taken for me to complete all three campaigns on a normal difficulty setting.  There is some replay value in attempting to achieve some of the medals for secondary objectives but I would not envisage this taking more than about another hour of gameplay.  So £9.99 for three hours of game play, I don't feel that's value for money.\n\nThe original Company of Heroes was/is an exceptional game that rightfully is considered to be one the greatest RTS games ever made.  This game seems to run on the same engine and is a stand alone game to the original so you don't need that to play it.  There are three campaigns, though I use that word in the loosest sense as none of them are very long, all centred around the campaign in Normandy.  Each campaign consists of three missions which are all on the same map (to be clear there are three maps, one for each campaign).  There are two German campaigns and one US campaign.\n\nThe first campaign has you in control of one (yes one) Tiger tank for two of the missions, gaining a second for the final mission.  This is a relatively quick but somewhat stale campaign as you're normally used to managing a number of units in combined operations.  The designers (in a nod to Men of War) have also included a direct fire command so you can target enemy units directly with the mouse.  This feature didn't really add anything to the game for me and felt tacked on.\n\nThe second campaign has you controlling two US squads with an expanded force later on.  This is slightly more challenging although I question the results of some of the combat as they seem to be 'super soldiers'.  This is challenging given that you are fighting with infantry against vehicles and infantry in fortifications with artillery support.\n\nThe third campaign is much better and has you defending a town (Chambois) at the base of the Falaise gap as the German's against relentless Allied ground and air assault.  This is more like the classic Company of Heroes, requiring you to cotrol sectors, build defences, recruit different troop types and muster a defence against a superior enemy.  This for me was the most challenging and enjoyable campaign and one I will play again.\n\nI haven't played multiplayer but there a number of different units that change the unit roster for the various countries.  I can't comment directly but I'm not sure that having an amphibious kubelwagen really adds that much beyond novelty!\n\nI feel that Opposing Fronts adds much more for the single player and multiplayer and if you haven't got that then I'd go for that one first.\n\nI add that I got this game for free in a PC Gamer magazine so for value I'd say that about £0.50 to £1.50 is what I would pay for this.","May 11, 2015","false","3.9"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","6","0","0"

Additionally this effectively limits the game modes you can play to 'victory point' (KotH) only.\n\nThe singleplayer isn't very good either, the campaigns other than the US one I are extremely boring and skirmish(vs AI) isn't entertaining after a certain point.

So why am I giving this a negative review?\n\nHere's what happened: CoH's original publisher, THQ, went bankrupt and CoH and its development house were sold to Sega. Multiplayer infrastructure is now handled natively through Steam. This sounds great in theory, but in practice, the game suffers from constant, crippling crashes. It really is unplayably bad. It's unconscionable that things could have been allowed to deteriorate so badly, but I suppose it was inevitable that such an old game wouldn't get the love it needed. The gameplay and graphics really do hold up quite well: in fact I'd say it bests CoH 2 in practically all regards.\n\nWhat a sad and ignominious way for a beautiful game to live out its last days. CoH really didn't deserve to go out with a whimper. If you haven't played the single-player campaigns, you really owe it to yourself to play through the original and Opposing Fronts campaigns, which are brilliant. But as for multiplayer, this game is essentially over, barring the unlikely event that the netcode is ironed out to pre-Steam levels.\n\nFare ye well, CoH.","February 1, 2014","false","349.8"," 4 of 18 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","4","18","0","2"

While I never played Warcraft or Starcraft, the two things this will most get compared to, I know enough that they aren't alike. Where as the Crafts are all about gathering resources, Company of Heroes is about taking and keeping strategic points - increasing your influence on the map and gaining you extra resources and manpower to out play your enemy. Play as either the Allies (America and Britian) or the Axis (Wehrmacht or Panzer Elite) and fight each other over control of Normandy and the rest of Paris. Deploy Airborne and Commandos as the Allies, or bring forth the mighty Tiger or Jagdpanther tank hunter as the Axis. While there are certain tactics that will always win (there always is, no matter what people say), the game does allow for freedom; and a fairly balanced game 'tween Allies and Axis players.","February 18, 2011","true","372.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

ToV, unlike Oppossing Fronts, does not add any new factions compared to the base game. Instead, it adds three new campaigns (Really only two campaigns; Tiger Ace is a three mission mini-campaign) and a plethora of multiplayer features to enhance playing online. Namely, it introduces new units, such as the Kangaroo Carrier or the Swhimmwagen 166. Also, there is three new game types for online play: Assault, Panzerkrieg, and Stonewall. Assault is much like CoH's Defence of the Ancients, with players being hero units fighting to destroy the enemy's base. Panzerkieg is similar to Assault, but with tanks and control points. Stonewall, however, has the player and teammates fighting together to hold back the enemy from capturing the city you are located in. In all, if you are debating to get base over ToV, I'd get ToV.

With splendid sound, fluid animations, intense gameplay and superb online there is nowhere to go wrong with this game. Based in the World War 2 era CoH:ToV is based around 4 factions; the Americans, the British, the Panzer Elite and the Wehrmacht. All campaigns from the three games are on the Tales of Valor main menu so there is no need to start the seperate ones up and also you can play with anyone regardless if they only have CoH or if they have all 3. Playing online and offline are both experiences you need to have so I reccomend purchase this game with the utmost urgency. I rate this game 10/10 for its perfect sound, gameplay, online, and portrayal of war in the 1940s.","December 17, 2011","true","181.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have played this game religiously since it first came out 7 years ago. The graphics remain some of the best I have ever seen. The freedom of view point allows camera angles previously reserved for cinema. It was a gaming experience like none other and few have come close to matching. The voice acting is incredible with interactive reports coming from units at all times. The AI in particular is very impressive with a progressive strategy building heavier units as the match goes on. You can actually see on the replays where the AI builds certain units to counter the units you use most. I must admit the game was better in vanilla the patches just made things complicated. I'd develop a playing style and suddenly the mg was weak or my favorite tank was now a tin can. Tales of Valor specifically added some nice gameplay and a few decent units to unlock. The campaign really made you feel for those Germans who fought for country and home rather than agenda and hatred. This game creates a bond among gamers I've never developed longterm online friendships before CoH. My one gripe and this is true for many players the US 57mm AT gun is so overpowered. It can somehow outrange anything on the map minus a hummel and destroys everything in a few hits. I understand balance is an issue because let's face it the Germans had better soldiers and weapons. In a fair fight with equal resources the allies would stand absolutely no chance. 10 million dead Russians can attest to that.","March 7, 2014","true","352.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Deformable terrain, cover, squads, veterancy, gorgeous and balanced maps, novel 'commander abilities' that unlock over the course of each battle and raise the tempo of combat. The music and voice over is excellent. The single-player campaigns/missions are excellent but the multi-player game is where it's at. Not quite the clickfest that is StarCraft, Company of Heroes is more about battlefield tactics - using cover, diversions, combined arms, and manoeuvre to outfight your opponents. Generally you only ever have to look after 3-8 units and the AI does an outstanding job of prioritizing targets. This was my preferred lunch time game for a year and a half (2006-2007) and shares some blame for 'Mass Effect  1' being a bit delayed.","April 12, 2011","true","480.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good enough that I - not a fan of strategy games, started playing from the time i had oportunity with such a pleasure, that not many games (and I mean any genre) can give. Everything from gameplay to sounds are great. No wonder its considered probably the best RTS of all time. It also has the Highest score up to date. Thats what RTS really should be like. Competetive multiplayer is a bit harsh now, because there are still many hardcore players playing it. Therefore it can be frustrating automatched with someone who is a pro. Besides that is pleasure to play against PC or friends. If by any chance you are rts fan and havent tried this - punch or kick yourself in the face. Go buy it and try it. If you're not a fan of RTS i dare you try it and say that you dont like it. I wont go into details like watching 1vs1 tank battle when oponent tries to escape leaving his back open and gets a shot that pierces his rear armor, and explodes in beautifull detail (like i said i wont go into details) but i just cant get enough of this game.

From there, expect to have the hours stolen away from you, as your men valiantly fight off or through Panzers and infantry.\n\nWell crafted game, with plenty of replayability, and with it frequently on sale, there is little excuse not to have this fine game in your collection.","July 10, 2011","true","55.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's an amazing RTS game and it's great for those tactical-minded people out there. And plus its not very complicated, its very easy to learn.  It has a little bit of age on it (2006ish) but the graphics are still great and you can get the original Company of Heroes on Steam for under 10 dollars which is a steal for a game that can eat all your hours up. It has a great campaign which the expansions also add on more campaigns, you can play as the German Luffwafte or the United States or Great Britain. The resourses you collect in this game are obtained by capturing "points" so you focus on the warfare and no industrial side of this game, just all out war. The AI is competent and it can be challeging at times. If you call yourself a tactical gamer this game is a MUST HAVE..","July 5, 2011","true","26.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have played this game religiously since it first came out 7 years ago. The graphics remain some of the best I have ever seen. The freedom of view point allows camera angles previously reserved for cinema. It was a gaming experience like none other and few have come close to matching. The voice acting is incredible with interactive reports coming from units at all times. The AI in particular is very impressive with a progressive strategy building heavier units as the match goes on. You can actually see on the replays where the AI builds certain units to counter the units you use most. I must admit the game was better in vanilla the patches just made things complicated. I'd develop a playing style and suddenly the mg was weak or my favorite tank was now a tin can. Tales of Valor specifically added some nice gameplay and a few decent units to unlock. The campaign really made you feel for those Germans who fought for country and home rather than agenda and hatred. This game creates a bond among gamers I've never developed longterm online friendships before CoH. My one gripe and this is true for many players the US 57mm AT gun is so overpowered. It can somehow outrange anything on the map minus a hummel and destroys everything in a few hits. I understand balance is an issue because let's face it the Germans had better soldiers and weapons. In a fair fight with equal resources the allies would stand absolutely no chance. 10 million dead Russians can attest to that.","March 7, 2014","true","352.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

ToV, unlike Oppossing Fronts, does not add any new factions compared to the base game. Instead, it adds three new campaigns (Really only two campaigns; Tiger Ace is a three mission mini-campaign) and a plethora of multiplayer features to enhance playing online. Namely, it introduces new units, such as the Kangaroo Carrier or the Swhimmwagen 166. Also, there is three new game types for online play: Assault, Panzerkrieg, and Stonewall. Assault is much like CoH's Defence of the Ancients, with players being hero units fighting to destroy the enemy's base. Panzerkieg is similar to Assault, but with tanks and control points. Stonewall, however, has the player and teammates fighting together to hold back the enemy from capturing the city you are located in. In all, if you are debating to get base over ToV, I'd get ToV. The one campaign you'd miss is nothing compared to the online modes  you'd miss out on.","June 17, 2012","true","93.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The map destruction and explosion effects are amazing.

Well, for starters, it's a World War II based RTS game with great graphics and a great physics engine. The singleplayer campaigns are immersive and interesting. They keep you on your toes and are not only fun to look at, but they are historically accurate down to the letter (mostly). The online community is decent enough but you'll always get a few try-hards here and there. It is a strategy game, though, so it does require a little more thinking than just spamming something. That doesn't work in this game, unless you have tanks. Tanks are always nice, unless they are shooting at you. Anyway, Relic did not drop the ball on this series. They went all out. This is their gem, as far as i'm concerned.\n\nTry any of the Company of Heroes versions before trying Company of Heroes 2, which is almost a different game.","September 11, 2015","true","42.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good enough that I - not a fan of strategy games, started playing from the time i had oportunity with such a pleasure, that not many games (and I mean any genre) can give. Everything from gameplay to sounds are great. No wonder its considered probably the best RTS of all time. It also has the Highest score up to date. Thats what RTS really should be like. Competetive multiplayer is a bit harsh now, because there are still many hardcore players playing it. Therefore it can be frustrating automatched with someone who is a pro. Besides that is pleasure to play against PC or friends. If by any chance you are rts fan and havent tried this - punch or kick yourself in the face. Go buy it and try it. If you're not a fan of RTS i dare you try it and say that you dont like it. I wont go into details like watching 1vs1 tank battle when oponent tries to escape leaving his back open and gets a shot that pierces his rear armor, and explodes in beautifull detail (like i said i wont go into details) but i just cant get enough of this game.

Nowhere near as good as 1st CoH with Opposing fronts. Replayability is boring. Missions are once and done. AI units are stupid running down fires protecting your troops from freezing or sitting in groups off to side when ordered to attack "here". In Falaise Gap, flame throwing tank shrugs off 88mm cannon shell from rear flank, kills the crew, then backs over anti tank obstacles destroying them all (12) in under 5 sec. Really?!!! I seem to remember 88s killing my tanks from the other side of the screen in other scenarios.Total crap as far as realism goes.

And WW2 buffs.\nIt won so many awards and has the best metascore of all time for an RTS game.\n\nIts game mechanics are so complex that most people won't even know how good it is, behind the scenes the calculations going on are huge. It's not a simple always hit and do set damage model like poor Starcraft(2) with a few armor types thrown in the mix.\nThe bad thing is it doesn't communicate this info in game (you have to get modding tools and see the stat files).\nThe good thing is most of the mechanics work with realism in mind so you can use your normal judgement of things. Like long range - less accuracy (and lower rate of fire for some weapons). Hit tank in back - more penetration. Etc.\nGraphics and Audio are top notch.\nPlus it's cheap ;)","December 30, 2011","true","242.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought this game mostly for the well-known mulitplayer and man did I not get disappointed. Playing as the Germans are so fun with friends who know what they are doing. Alot of tactics can be played in this game and it pays off big time.  When I first picked up this game I didn't know jack. After 2 days on watching videos and reading forums, I now understand the basic concept of how to play it. Picking up this game was easy for me since I had a huge RTS gamer background. For those who are looking into the RTS genre, this is a great starter. This game is easy to learn and easy to pick up once you know what you are doing.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves WW2 or RTS in general.","June 3","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
