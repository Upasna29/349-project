"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/recommended/345180/","aprofilehere","Gunderson Mallard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/","2360 products in account","Intuitive controls, clever combat, and polish all work nicely to make Vran stand out. Players will find themselves wall jumping to find secrets and dodge rolling to avoid attacks all with the comfort of smooth directional input (WASD or controller).  Though Vran has loot (graded equipment with random qualities), sprawling dungeons, and grinding like many traditional ARPGs, a fair amount of the game has a tinge of Bastion to it.\n\nFor those who have not yet played Bastion, it is a whimsical ARPG that skips loot in favor of loadouts where weapons determine play style, difficulty can be shaped by modifiers, equipment is handled by handful of set items, special abilities are separate from weapons, and character progression involves opening more ways to tinker with these aspects. Victor Vran follows Bastion fairly close in these areas, but with some great added twists in addition to loot.\n\nEvery weapon uses a kit of three abilities and powerful special skills use an “overdrive” meter which can be filled a few different ways. The weapons are finely designed: each type feels fun, unique, and balanced, so choosing any of the bunch is satisfying. The kits are engaging and reward players for stringing abilities or timing attacks carefully rather than button mashing. The game also tries to mitigate the burn of carrying favored-but-weaker equipment by letting players break down gear to boost weapons within limit. Despite the drastic visual shift, outfits mainly change how overdrive generates; the more interesting parts to tinker with are destiny cards. These cards, equipped by using “destiny points” from a pool, offer everything from more damage to weapon specialization, and like weapons they act as loot. Once the basic mechanics become second nature, picking the right equipment for the job is a lot of fun.\n\nVictor Vran’s amount of build freedom houses a lot 	of potential for players, but comes at a cost. Character progression suffers a bit in order to allow players to tinker freely. After a few levels, leveling up is underwhelming because it only grants health or destiny points and an item. The lack of hard classes or skill trees means there is no Blessed Hammer moment or satisfaction of a full skill tree. Once you see all the kits and weapon cards, you have seen a large portion of builds. There is little reason to start a new game unless you plan on starting a fresh co-op run. To be fair, the game really tries to push towards an extended endgame experience with lots of challenges, an endless dungeon, and equipment boosting.\n\nPut plainly, Victor Vran is bland outside of gameplay. Other recent ARPGs having some kind of personality: Bastion’s narration, Diablo’s legacy, and The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing’s chatty characters all succeed. Vran’s story could be bottled as a sleep aid, and the characters are as memorable as that one movie with Kevin Costner and a non-white cast that came out last year- oh wait, there were two. What is strange is that Victor talks to the handful of NPCs (also forgettable) in the hub area but rarely talks when adventuring. While The Voice, some mask that tags along with Victor, blabbers on everywhere except the hub area. The Voice is rather unfunny: lazy references, mocking Victor who has no character or comebacks, and hit-or-miss observations. The Incredibly Long Title for a Game Helsing has protagonists that share banter. Bastion has a strong narrator. Vran has broody grumbles with an unamusing companion whom he ignores. Not a deal breaker, but it is certainly a misstep, and it is possible that the real villain of the game just sucked the personality dry.\n\nVictor Vran is polished, fluid, and different. The combat, equipment and movement in the game craft an absorbing experience. At the time of this writing, the devs have released much of their planned post-release content with the notable exceptions of local co-op and a Motörhead expansion (which may be tied to the tragic loss of Lemmy). The base game offers a healthy foundation for continued support and I would gladly buy any content they decide to add. While story and character may fall short, the gameplay is rewarding and dynamic.\n","January 15","true","21.3"," 97 of 103 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","97","103","8","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/auspexao/recommended/345180/","auspexao","AuspexAO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/auspexao/","786 products in account","**This review is for the final game. I've completed the first Act and have aquired the "hex" system for increasing difficulty (explained below).\n\nAs a long time fan of the action RPG (ARPG) I'm always on the lookout for new entries in the genre that Diablo made famous. With some glaring exceptions, the ARPG over the last few years has not disappointed with games like Torchlight 2, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, and Diablo III (post auction house). I'm happy to report that Victor Vran is another excellent example of ARPG done right.\n\nGraphics: Let's start off with the least important (and least impressive) thing in this game. ARPGs rely on visual indicators to tell you what kind of attacks you are being subjected to and they can't clutter the screen with tons of words and icons like a MMO or traditional RPG. Victor Vran's art style is clean and fits the dark tone of the game, it's not visually amazing even with everything cranked to the max, but the information the game and its user interface delivers to the player is streamlined and I never had trouble figuring out what I was looking at or what exactly an attack was.\n\nSound: Fittingly spooky music, good voice acting (the main character sounds remarkably like Geralt of Rivia), and some really "meta" lines from the narrator (which you will either love or despise, believe me). The weapon attacks sound great from the boom of the shotgun to the weighty thumps of the hammer.\n\nGameplay: Ok, let's get down to what really counts here. What makes this game worth playing amongst its peers? The action it puts back in ARPG. Victor can run and jump, roll deftly, and leap down from ledges to explore lower areas. The gameplay feels great and the controller interface is nice and smooth without taking away from mouse-driven staples like clicking away frantically at monsters. The skills are weapon based, but the game really encourages you to switch weapons often and doesn't use a skill tree so you're always going to be very efficient with every skill in the game (more or less depending on your other gear synergy, of course). Fans of the genre may lament the lack of a sprawling skill tree with tons of customization options, but this game places skill above build and you will need to actually learn how each skill interacts to clear all the "kill monsters with x weapon" challenges.\n\nVictor can also equip potions and bombs (on cooldowns, no spamming) as well as two magic spells called Demonic Powers. These powers range from beneficial auras to meteors that fall from the sky. The destiny cards you find or get at level-up grant your passives and can be swapped on the fly to mess with your build. There are also outfits that change how your demon power is restored (amongst other bonuses) so there is plenty to tinker with even without the skill tree.\n\nThe most interesting thing for me about the gameplay was the challenge system. Each map has a few challenges to complete that really direct your gameplay. The effect of these challenges cannot be understated because their presence keeps the game from feeling repetitive. On one map you may be trying not to take a single hit and on the next you may need to use a weapon that you haven't mastered yet. Past level 12 you pick up "hexes" which are similar to Bastion's gods or Transistor's limiters in that they reward you with greater prizes for suffering buffs to your foes and debuffs to you. The rewards are so amazing that I was tempted to leave them on, and they even have a leveling mechanic of their own to intice completionists.\n\nVictor Vran is a lot of fun. I don't know how long the game will remain fresh without different classes and skill trees, but for the money to time ratio, it's a definite "buy".","July 26, 2015","true","5.5"," 99 of 115 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","99","115","6","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iHaveNoRegret/recommended/345180/","iHaveNoRegret","LLsGOT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iHaveNoRegret/","101 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAlright, so after putting 10 hours into Victor Vran and completing ALL of the content that this Early Access had to offer, here is my review:\n\nThe game takes a bit of a casual approach to the ARPG genre, pretty close to that of Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance. The enemies in this version of EA have good AI, varied skills, and different means in which you should go about defeating them if you want to be efficient. Rather than having classes, in VV (Victor Vran) there is only one hero, that's why his name is the same as the game. Instead the game's focus is on making every piece of equipment so vastly different that gives the game a very unique feel. Each weapon has a different attacks, effects and skills/abilities associated with them. There are also powerful spells that require you to build up energy through various means to perform for great effect, and potions/elixirs to quickly change the flow of battle in your favor.\n\nThe game offers a challenge to the more experienced players pretty early on in the form of Hexes. When activated, they will continiously reward you so long as they are on, but also make the enemies far more dangerous. As a veteran of ARPGs, I felt far more entertained with two of them on the entire time that I played, turning on a couple more every now and then to make the game more difficult when I went back to clear lower level areas. Speaking of which, every area has a set of five challenges that you can complete for immediate rewards. While this is cool and all, I sincerely hope that is not their idea of "end-game content."\n\nThe graphics in VV are good for an ARPG, no complaints there and the animations feel very fluid. Aesthetically, the game reminds me a lot of Torchlight which I miss quite a bit, so this game is hitting a lot of the right places for me. Sound-wise, so far the game has had a few bugs like a sound effect getting stuck on a loop but I am sure it's already being fixed, or will be. Now the controls... They are not your typical ARPG like Diablo or Path of Exile where it is mouse-based movement, instead VV goes for a WASD movement style with a panning camera which a lot of people are not too excited about. Honestly, after about an hour or two of gameplay and rebinding the keys to my liking, the gameplay felt very smooth. There are times when their acrobatics system is a bit tedious and being a real pain in the ♥♥♥ with wall-climbing... It is a nice system that just takes a little getting used to but gives so many new options to how you approach the environment.\n\nCurrently, my only problem is... What will this game's content be like? What about it's end-game? Many ARPGs use procedurally generated content because it makes every playthrough a little different and makes repeating areas a whole lot less tedious. Victor Vran does not take after this idea and uses hand crafted terrain with preplaced enemy spawns. Now while I didn't really feel this was a big problem, it does take a bit of the magic away. This leads me to wonder about what will happen once you clear all of the areas and challenges, then what? Is that it? Path of Exile has semiannual races/leagues, maps, and a permadeath alternative. Diablo has levels of torment, bounties, and a pemadeath option as well. What will Victor Vran have? What will make me want to keep coming back to this game? Or is that really it, just a campaign with Hexes and Challenges to spice it up?\n\nSo in the end, my answer is Yes, I recommend this game as it stands now. I had a fun 10 hours of gameplay and feel the game has already been worth the $15 USD that I paid for it.","February 23, 2015","true","92.7"," 74 of 79 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","74","79","0","0"

I love the dungeon crawling, rogue, hack & slash ARPG gameplay. I've seen this game compared to several, including Diablo and Van Helsing, and overall, I agree with the general comparison. There are some very unique elements, though, including demon powers, destiny cards, and transmutation.\n\nI've put in more than 200 hours of gameplay at this point and am at level 50 +3 renown. I've had a blast playing around with the variety of weapons and attributes, bounties, and treasure hunts. There are many secrets to uncover, a plethora of destructibles to smash, and an impressive amount of items to loot.\n\nThere are also some really challenging, yet attainable, achievements. You'll find both in-game achievements, ranging from normal to elite, and also Steam achievements which mirror in-game challenges or happen naturally with progressive gameplay.\n\nThe soundtrack is very good and serves to enhance the gothic feel that this game has. There is a bit of humor in the narration and many classic cultural references made throughout the game. It's nearly impossible to experience everything on just one playthrough, but I certainly challenge you to try.\n\nCollectors like myself will enjoy the cards, achievements, and the truly massive amount of weapons and items available to obtain. There are different styles of combat, including the standard adventurer's melee, thaumaturge, and arcane mechanic, with specific weapons and items for each. That translates to a great deal of replayability.\n\nThe gaming environment is stunning, and there is a lot of content. Even the most experienced gamer will find a challenge here, and amateur engineers should have fun with the transmutation aspect. There's a great deal of satisfaction in creating the "perfect" weapon, and of course, transmutation can be used to create items for your collection that you haven't found yet, especially the elusive legendaries.\n\nI love everything about this game, and it's likely to be played many times. I sincerely hope the developers are working on a sequel. This game is in my absolute favorite genre, and I would welcome additional content and exploration of this fantastic gaming environment.\n\n\n*This review is featured on the curator page of Good Games Giveaways & Reviews.","January 31","true","253.5"," 51 of 53 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","51","53","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/345180/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Victor VranDeveloper: Haemimont Games\nPublisher: EuroVideo Medien\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nFrom the makers of Tropico and Omerta: City of Gangsters, comes an isometric hack n' slash RPG! Victor Vran boasts a fun, intuitive combat system that can pump out some serious hurt on the hordes of enemies you'll be facing as you explore the game's world. Victor is a Hunter, and at first is on a mission to find his lost friend, Adrian, in a city plagued by monsters. With the city's defenses failing, it's up to Victor to save everyone during his quest to find Adrian. Let's take a closer look at Victor Vran.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nTaking the signature isometric angle that other games in this genre take, Victor Vran plays nearly exactly like games such as Diablo II or Torchlight. The difference is in the combat system. It is almost completing hack n' slash styled, and is really a blast to play once you have all your gear and abilities in order. Victor is able to jump off of walls to reach higher ground or avoid attacks. There are several different weapon types, including Swords, Rapiers, Shotguns, Scythes, and Hammers. Each weapon type excels at a certain aspect of combat. Swords are great all-purpose weapons, while Scythes and Hammers are great for tackling large groups. Shotguns and Rapiers handle single targets very well, although are a bit slower than the other types. Each weapons type also comes with a certain set of Skills. Learning how to most effectively use each weapon type and their abilities is key to survival. Oh, did I mention you can have 2 different weapons equipped at once, and switch between them on the fly at the press of a button? This allows you to chain together some pretty sick combos!\n\nIn addition to weapons, there are also Outfits, Demon Powers, and Destiny Cards. Outfits simply define your playstyle, offering different ways to fill your Overdrive Meter. If you've ever played Final Fantasy X and remember the different Overdrive Modes it had, you're on the right track. There are a total of 4 possible Outfits, and it is recommended that you take the one that most suits your style of play--ranged, melee, caster, or all-purpose. Once you have filled Victor's Overdrive meter, you can unleash a special Demon Power ability. These range from dealing damage to single or multiple targets, giving Victor special buffs, or placing debuffs on surrounding enemies. A great way to stack on damage is to tack on an area of effect Demon Power to your Weapon combos, such as Meteor. Destiny Cards are cards that you can equip to add small bonus stats to Victor. Demon Powers and Destiny Cards can be found via loot drops, or hidden in secret chests which are sparsely scattered about each map.\n\nSpeaking of secrets, each map has a set of challenges you can complete. These can be anything such as defeating a certain number of enemies in a certain time frame, breaking a certain number of urns, defeating specific special monsters, or finding a number of hidden 'secret' chests on each stage. Some of these challenges are very difficult, and can take some time to complete if you are going for 100% completion on each stage. Each challenge, when completed, instantly rewards you with items, gold, or experience points. As you gain experience points you level up, and upon level up you get to choose between 3 bonuses. These bonus can be extra stats (like +300 health), item chests (which contain random weapons/loot), Destiny Cards, Demon Powers, or weapons.\n\nVictor Vran also offers co-op, with up to 4 players that can join a game and mow through hordes of enemies together. There are also a lot of neat little Easter Eggs and references scattered throughout, such as the infamous "Arrow to the Knee" Skyrim joke, and a small nod to The Stanley Parable.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nVictor Vran is a beautiful game. The angle at which the game is played helps to point out details in the environment. Everything is fully fleshed out and detailed. The buildings, the NPC models, the monsters...all of them look very good and are easily distinguishable. The game has a very dark feel to it, which is perfect for this style of game and its setting/concept. Each monster type is unique and can be identified on screen with ease. Champion monsters have a special aura that can't be missed.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nThe very first thing you will notice about this game is that Victor is voice by Doug Cockle...the same guy who voices Geralt of Rivia in all of the Witcher games! This can be a selling point or a hindrance, depending on how you look at it. People who aren't big fans of the Witcher might be annoyed by it slightly, but those who are fans will realize that Doug's unique voice talents lend perfectly to bringing Victor and his persona to life.\n\nDreary and archaic are the two best words to describe the soundtrack. The music lends to the dark mood that the game has, accenting the action and locations perfectly. Weapon attacks sound great, although the shotgun is a bit louder than everything else. If you choose to go the ranged playstyle route, be prepared for that! Some enemies have unique sounds, and at times only make specific sounds when performing specific attacks. Along with their visual cues, if you listen closely you can learn to dodge monster attacks on the fly using the roll/dodge button. Dodging is key to survival when facing large groups, so paying attention to visual and audio cues can save your life!\n\nPerformance\n==========\nThis game is very well optimized. I ran it at a nearly perfect 55-60 FPS on Medium settings with my low-mid tier custom PC. Lowering the settings made it run even better, at the expense of visual quality--which for this type of game isn't too big of a deal. I can see how some people might have issues running it, so lowering the quality of visuals will definitely boost your performance. Speaking of quality, there are a lot of options for it, video and audio.\n\nI frequently use a Logitech F310 controller with whatever games support it, and Victor Vran played perfectly with it. I did not try mouse/keyboard controls because my controller worked so well!\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nA great title that somehow stands out on it's on in the genre. With a great combat system and the potential for some amazing combos, Victor Vran is a great experience. The only downside is that it is a bit shorter than most other games in the genre, even more so if you play co-op with a friend or friends. It is still very much worth taking a look at, especially with some of the free planned DLC on the way!\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-2Kgr9wKV4\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nHighly Recommended\nNote: A key for this game was provided by the developer for the purpose of writing an informative review. No other compensation was given.\n\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","July 27, 2015","true","13.6"," 120 of 161 people (75%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","75","120","161","8","11"

The game is packed with humor and doesn’t take its setting or story particularly seriously. The voice of the main character will be instantly recognized as Doug Cockle, the voice actor who also voices The Witcher’s Geralt of rivia. The game doesn’t hide this fact with lines making references to the Witcher and with Vran himself sounding exactly like the other monster hunter in an overtly silly way. The games humor is a nice touch and works very well in some places. The voice acting is all done well, even the intentionally cheesy elements, the star of the show however is the voice inside Vran’s head who acts as a narrator in everything you do and will comment on what you’re doing. The narrator is a blend of the narrator from bastion but with the personality of Borderlands 2 handsome Jack providing a dark humor to all the narration for example calling victor Vicky throughout.\n\nOnline co-op is featured which I think is a huge benefit to the game. ARPG's in general are one of the only genres where co-op modes not only work well but can provide huge benefits and personal enjoyment. Victor Vrans online mode works well and will the fast paced combat a lot of fun can be had playing with others online. It’s one of those few games that’s good in both short bursts and long play sessions and it’s a game that keeps you engaged throughout.\n\nThe core mechanics of the game while simplistic are fun and addictive, it goes to show that a game doesn’t need to be complex to have large amounts of both playability and fun. The ARPG genre is a popular genre but there’s few massive hits out there, even fewer with a high standard of quality in all aspects of the game. Victor Vran is one of those rare games, it has quality and quantity. The story is well written packed with humor and irony designed to poke fun at itself and various fantasy games.\n","July 24, 2015","true","8.4"," 70 of 86 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","70","86","3","2"

So a Sword has always the same sword-skills but each sword you'll find has different stats.\nThen you have 1 (later 2) "demon-powers". Which are nice special powers. But they drop as items. And they have come in different qualities and can be collected and transmuted into something even greater.\nAnd then you "fate-cards". As the name implies, those are cards. Different types, boni, quality and stats. Again collect-able and transmutable.\nThe higher your level the more fate-cards you can equip.\nWhat a true item-orgy!\n\nSo no more worries about choosing wrong skills and gimping your character. Just pause mid-fight and change the cards/demon-powers/weapons. Yay!\n\nThe story is...the story of an ARPG. You are a hunter and super mighty and blablabla. It's ok but nothing you would tell your grand kids at a campfire :)\n\n(I have not tried the multiplayer-part, so no judging here)\n\nThe good (what to love):\nVictor has the voice of "The Witcher" :-)\nAnother person (to avoid spoilers) is the narrator of Stanley's Parable. And even says at one time "Stanley...err Victor" :-)\nJumping! Nothing major, but adds some depth to maneuvering mobs by jumping over them or find hidden Chests\nEach map has more or less easy bonus goals for the extra challenge which lead to extra money or items or XP. Can you 5-star all maps?\nWonderfully fitting and non-annoying soundtrack.\nMore than enough options to visually tweak performance to your machine\nDye! There are only complete costumes instead of the usual X pieces of armor, but you can at least dye them!\nVery much destroyable things. Even an innocent park bench may contain money and weapons :-)\nTransmutation. If the usual item-juggling isn't enough for you, you can gamble or simply improve all your stuff like 3 normal items = 1 magic item etc.\nLoading times are a blaze. Never spend any time waiting.\nHardest difficulty and extra bonus challenges on each map not challenging enough? Challenge yourself with "Hexes". More XP and more Items each at a "price".\nChoose yourself: WSAD or Click-to-move? Both available..\nInteresting Class-/Levelingsystem!\nThe usual Townportal (in the game's menu though, i discovered it at level 20+ /facepalm)\nCodex with everything you'd want to know: Story, Hints, Weapons, Monsters, Conditions, Recipes...\nSharing of codes you've found with others. Type in the key, receive a treasure hunt, monster hunt etc. Solve them and receive nice extra goodies.\nThe bad (not good, but not gamebreakingly awful):\nSome unbalance in enemies. One boss you kill instantly and some random goons take forever without a reward. Or it's me being too dumb to adapt. IDK.\nIt starts more or less seriously (as serious as one ARPG can get), then it drifts into a more self-parody. One loves it, one hates it.\nNo zooming. Sometimes a bit zooming in or out would not hurt.\nCool down on potion is awfully long. But OK, some may like that extra challenge :)\nThe ugly (what to hate, may kill the fun):\nNothing!\n\nRecommended?\n\nIf you like ARPG, you will like Victor Vran.\nIf you liked said "Incredible Van Helsing"-series, you would like it even more.\n\nBut if you like your ARPG to be dead-serious like Diablo 3 or the Germans, you may be annoyed/disappointed by that person i mentioned above.\nHumor is subjective and one's ROFL is another one's OMG and vice versa.\nSo it's always a minefield to apply some humor to your game. I personally enjoyed it, mostly because it so often reminded me of "Stanley's Parable" (which i loved).\n\n\nOh and a honorary mention: One of the rare gems that left Early Access more or less precisely the day it was announced back when it got released!","August 7, 2015","true","25.5"," 50 of 56 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","50","56","5","10"

Among this you of course can complete challenges, level your character and do other stuff to reach max level, i would say game offers atleast +30h of gameplay.\n\nOverall i think this is one of the best additions to the whole genre, while PoE and D3 have been pretty lacking, i feel Viktor Vran has very nice/Smooth and balanced gameplay that lets you have multiple playstyles instead of forced in this one Broken style of play.\n\nThe price point for this game is great, for that reason i think its pretty much worth your money.","July 16, 2015","true","14.1"," 34 of 34 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","34","34","5","0"

You play as Victor Vran, a monster hunter, who uses a variety of weapons, equipment and abilities to slay monsters. The game is very early in development so it currently does not have a story and you just explore the world levelling up and finding loot. A lot of people say this game a rip-off of Van Helsing but from what I have played of both games Vran has a very different setting, enemies are quite different and the characters themselves are very different.\n\n+Very nice graphics\n+Fun combat and each weapon brings a new style of combat to the game\n+The currently implemented weapons a very different to each other\n+Very simple UI which allows you to focus on the game\n+The devs have decided not to include the story until full release (May 2015) meaning you'll be able to fully enjoy the story once everything has been implemented\n+It isn't supposed to be in Early Access for very long though it is hard to say whether or not the devs will keep to their schedule as there have been no updates yet (but after only 8 days of being out that is to be expected)\n+Variety of enemies\n+You can get destiny cards which when equipped give you special buffs\n+Quite a few different consumables\n+Nice music\n+You can jump which is nice to see in this kind of game\n+I haven't encountered a single bug\n+Areas reset when you leave so you can go back and get more loot\n+As well as weapon abilities you also have demon powers which are really cool\n+Devs are active in the forums and listen to suggestions made by the community\n\n-Consumables have stupidly long cooldown times, while playing I often died because my health potion was still on cooldown\n-Currently only four types of weapons in the game but they each have a number of variations\n-No voice acting yet\n-A lot of placeholders but it's Early Access so it's to be expected\n-Enemies drop hardy any loot at all if at all\n-Level 10 is the current level cap and after you reach that level the replayability of the game drops\n-Some enemies feel unbalanced to me\n\nVerdict:\n7\n\nA fun monster hunting ARPG that is a good buy even at its early stage of development, I'd strongly recommend this game to fans of similar ARPGs.\n\nEl K.","February 28, 2015","true","5.9"," 54 of 67 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","54","67","0","3"

I should easily be over 12 hours and I own the game since a few days ago - and that is saying something...\n\nWhat's Victor Vran?\nTake the Diablo series (if you don't know what Diablo 1-2-3 is, you most likely don't like or care about isometric ARPGs, so you're better off closing this review now), remove its class system, and add the following: jumping and dodging; Guild Wars 2 style of combat (skills tied to the weapon type); way better voice actors (Doug Cockle, the Witcher 3's Geralt and Andrew Wincott as the Voice); good humor and easter eggs that break the leveling tedium, and last, but not least, just tell me in what other game you can do Gangnam Style in Kung Lao's Hat!? If it were only throwable too...\n\nSo, let's take a look at the good and the bad.\n\nThe GOOD:\n1. Great artwork and level design - extremely well made locations ranging from city streets, labyrinths, caves, halls to various dungeons.\n2. Great flashy combat animations - they really do justice to the title, even if the graphics are more reminiscent of a 2012 game than a 2015.\n3. Great music - the soundtracks are very dark, sinister and thematic. Even during the Gangnam style easter egg scene.\n4. Great voice actors - Doug Cockle, Andrew Wincott and Elena Saurel do an amazing job in this game. I also felt like Elena Saurel tries to immitate Triss at times and sound like her... Might just be me though. Too much Witcher 3, you know...\n5. Great protagonist - Victor Vran, the bulky demon hunter with a husky voice, the worst pickup lines ever and a voice in his head that both helps and misleads, jokes and makes fun of him is just awesome. And about that...\n6. There aren't many ARPGs that can put a smile on your face. This one does though - just when you start feeling bored with all the button mashing, either Victor Vran, the Voice, a monster, or a Boss shows up to crack a joke or do something funny.\n7. Innovates the ARPG genre - you can jump, wall jump, and dodge roll to either reach an area, a secret, avoid damage, or strategically position yourself in a fight. It makes an AMAZING difference in comparison to other ARPGs. I am sure masters of the game will abuse this mechanic a lot to avoid damage and set up perfect combos.\n8. Great weapon variety for both close, ranged, and mixed style-oriented "Vrans" - I was pleasantly surprised to discover that there is no obsolete weapon type in this game. 90% of the time you can easy build around the type of weapon you prefer (or want to run with) by improving on its strengths. The other 10% represent encounters where other weapon types work better than the one you currently predominantly use, or objectives that require you to complete some fights with a different weapon to get a reward.\n9. Even without classes, builds are possible - there are plenty of options in the game that you can mix and match to create efficient builds. You have your weapon with various prefixes and suffixes, outfit (but no armor pieces), destiny cards, demonic powers and potions. You can opt to build for melee-tank, melee-dps, ranged with crits, big demon power usage, etc. There are plenty of variations to keep you occupied.\n10. Set your own challenge - by selecting various hexes that affect you or the enemies upon entering an instance, you can increase the difficulty of an area and improve the awards gained from it - and of course, brag about your badassness.\n11. Every area has a task-reward system to it - I wouldn't call it a quest, really. Upon entering an area, you will be given a number of tasks you can strive to complete (or completely skip) with rewards like gold, xp, items, destiny cards, and so on tied to them. I find this a very nice touch, as it makes me think about something else than the mindless button mashing or grinding.\n12. Just like any ARPG, you can get your grind on in a major way - while you can absolutely do any instance just once or rush through the game, the completionist Vrans will endeavour to look under every nook and cranny, find all the secrets, do all the tasks, reap all the rewards, and redo areas as many times as it takes to complete everything.\n13. Awesome controller scheme - while controller usage is not a commonplace in ARPGs, Victor Vran does a stellar job integrating it. I am an all-out keyboard-and-mouse pc gamer, and I have been playing this title for about 12 hours with the controller. That is indeed saying something, so if you're more used to the controller, you will absolutely love the fact that they implemented it to such great extent.\n14. And mind you, this is purely subjective - I am personally done with grindy ARPGs and MMOS that take over 100 hours to complete. I am also over games that make me see the better way halfway through it, and because of the player that I am, I always restart to correct my mistakes... I did my fair share of them (over 2000 hours total in Diablo 1-2-3, over 1500 hours in Lineage 2 and over 2500 hours in Guild Wars 2) and I am all for 20-25 hour ARPGs right now, and this is why Victor Vran is the right game for me. Here you can just play - and fix the errors in your ways by swapping your builds on the fly.\n15. 4 player co-op - always a great thing to see!\n\nAnd now, let's take a look at the bad:\n1. Passable story - while the story is serviceable, do not expect anything amazingly epic. Someone screws up, you go fix it. That simple. No more, no less.\n2. Semi-RPG mechanics - while builds are an option based on mixing-matching the options given to you, the ARPG fans are used to way more in terms of min-maxing a character, with more skills, build options that make every class play differently and so on and so forth. Victor Vran does another serviceable, but by no means stellar job. It is nowhere near the likes of Diablo, Torchlight, Path of Exile, and Sacred 1&2 where you have tons of classes, you could shop, gamble, and grind for hours to make the best build. However, it is also not as pointless as the one in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows where you were leveling up without even realizing it...\n3. Replayability - steam says I am about 6 hours in, it is incorrect. I am about 12 hours in and I still have plenty of things to do. So I would venture to say that a single run would take anywhere from 15 to 19 hours, and over 20 if you are more fastidious and like to clear every single monster from an area and complete every single objective. This might be a turn-off to some gamers, and while to me in isn't, it is a fair point that I also need to put out there.\n4. A number of bosses so far really made me sweat and switch builds before tackling them... Boss battles in this game are hard, and yes, the one-hit-kill mechanic is present, and profoundly frustrating.\n5. No armor customization - while the outfits in this game are awesome, ranging from Dapper Vrans to Savage Vrans, the customization there is barren, as it is a whole piece. Yeah... no gloves, boots, torso, hat, amulet, ring, etc.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nVictor Vran is the right game for me, so it gets an easy recomendation. If you like action packed ARPGs with good amount of loot, lots of stuff to kill (as you'll be tripping on enemies every second step you take) and a side serving of humor alongside it, this game is absolutely the right one for you. I also believe that by the time I am posting the review, it is still on sale, so it should be a great buy. Anything over 33% off the title makes it a must own. You will absolutely get the full value for your money, even moreso if you decide to try another playstyle. The satisfying combat, the loot system, the amount of achievements, challenges, easter eggs, and the funny narrator are very strong selling points to this game. It is only held back by its mediocre story and incomplete customization (i.e. no classes and armor pieces). If you can live with these flaws, this game is absolutely the right one for you.","November 2, 2015","true","6.3"," 47 of 57 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","47","57","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/techzwn/recommended/345180/","techzwn","KnightErrant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/techzwn/","383 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nVictor Vran Is the Greatest Action RPG Since Diablo 2\n\nThis is an Early Access preview, which I published on TechZwn.\nhttp://techzwn.com/2015/07/victor-vran-is-the-greatest-action-rpg-since-diablo-2/\n\nI sometimes wonder whether any action-RPG could replace the mythical spot held by Diablo 2. There were only a couple that came close (in my opinion Bastion, Torchlight 2, and Path of Exile), and I’d say the rest were just fillers.\n\nBut a new game is has joined these ranks, and while I can’t say it manages to out-do Diablo 2, it certainly comes close.\n\nI nearly wrote off Victor Vran before trying it. It looked too much like a copy of Van Helsing (which is decent), but after giving it a shot, I was surprised to find a game that takes the monster-slaying mayhem of Diablo 2, combines it with the narration of Bastion, and brings in some of the skill-based combat of The Witcher series.\n\nThe developers at Haemimont Games seem to take many lessons from The Witcher 3. First and foremost, the main character (Victor Vran) sounds exactly like Geralt from The Witcher games. In Victor Vran, you’re a monster slayer, and you get called into a city that has been overrun with more horrible creatures than you could shake a boom-stick at. Your character comments on what he finds, comments on the smell and feeling of the places you take him. And he reminds you here and there of his role in this world, and the brother-like bond that exists between him and his fellow hunters (who you may come across alive or dead in this fallen city).\n\nAlso like in The Witcher, the combat makes you consider which tools would be best for a given area. Fighting spiders? Maybe the scythe would be best. Skeletons? Grab a warhammer or shotgun. Taking on a vampire? My choice is the rapier.\n\nThe combat is also built in a way that allows you to basically not get hit, if you’re good enough. You can roll out of danger, you can jump over enemies or projectiles, there are only a handful of skills and buffs you can use at once, and potions can only be used sparingly.\n\nTaking a few lessons from Bastion, you have a mysterious narrator who comments on your actions. And also like in Bastion, every weapon type in Victor Vran brings a significantly different combat experience. Playing with the warhammer feels slow and powerful. The sword feels devestating and puts you in harms way. The rapier is fast and agile. The shotgun makes you feel like an old-West gunslinger with a special attack that instantly recharges if you manage to kill the enemy.\n\nYou can choose between the Diablo-style controls, where the mouse controls your attacks and movement. Or you can go with the default action controls (which I chose), which lets you control movement with the keyboard, and attack with the mouse. The action control makes it feel a lot more like a skill-based combat game than it does a random click-fest.\n\nThe voice acting is very well done. Characters are convincing, and the actual dialogue is just as good. You don’t roll your eyes when an NPC speaks, and I found myself taking time to listen to the characters even if I could finish reading the dialogue before they could finish saying it.\n\nThere are a few features that some gamers might not like, but that seeem to be done intentionally by the developers. Victor Vran is simple. You only get a few spells. There isn’t a skill tree or a sheet of attributes you level up. And it basically doesn’t have any character classes.\n\nThere is only one hero in Victor Vran, with a choice of three different looks that give different buffs. Every time you level up, you’re given a new feature (like being able to wield two weapons, or being able to carry a new skill) and you’re given a choice between three items (typically cards that give you buffs, a spell, a weapon, or a mystery chest).\n\nInstead of having classes, it adapts to your playstyle. As you pick your perks, you slowly build the type of character you want to play. And you’re not locked into these choices. If you chose a card that gives more health for melee combat and you want to play ranged, you can just switch it out for another.\n\nIt seems the developers also expect you to swap weapons depending on what you’re up against. You could probably use the same weapon the whole game, but you’ll quickly see that some weapons work better against different enemies. This makes the combat feel more varied. If combat is starting to feel monotonous, you can just switch it up.\n\nWhat really makes Victor Vran shien, however, is that it’s deeply immersive. This is a culmination of everything it does well.\n\nYou feel like a monster slayer, Victor Vran describes his feeling or sensing, the narrator teases and comments on your actions, characters have personalities, the combat makes you stop and consider the best approach for each situation, and the story makes sense of why you’re basically one-manning a city overrun with monsters.","July 23, 2015","true","4.5"," 63 of 87 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","63","87","4","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/345180/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Victor Vran is a hack and slash RPG made by Haemimont Games (Tropico series, Omerta) that sadly came too late to face its subgenre rival, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing trilogy by Neocore Games. But let's not turn Victor into damnation, that would be a pity.\n\nWhilst many hack and slash RPGs typicaly use mouse for both movement and attacking, Victor Vran has mouse controls only for attacks. All your moves are done by classic WASD key set, with added rolling and jumping. Finally an isometric ARPG where you don't have to just stick in flat tunnels, you can even "bounce-jump" between walls! It's worth mentioning that even though I'm talking about keyboard and mouse controls, the game is also optimalised for controllers (no need to cry for features of console Diablo III not getting to PC).\n\nMany RPGs usually ask for many pieces of equipment for your character, like gloves, wrist armors, chest armors, etc., but Victor Vran does that conversely. You have only one slot for complete armor; developers took weapons and spells with higher priority. And that's reasonable, as every weapon type provides you a new skillset to use, so every weapon plays differently. You can choose from swords, guns, hammers, mortar guns and more.\n\nSpell system reminds me of Diablo I, as you find new spells throughout your adventures, or just buy them at the town's vendor. Disappointing fact is that there isn't a big spell variety, there's just a protective bubble, few auras and few offensive and utility spells. That also applies for enemies, since the skills they use are the ones you can get and use too. Well, even the enemies doesn't provide much variety, but I still find that reasonable with developers' budget.\n\nI've recently bought Diablo III, so I can put one important thing to comparison that made me really excited about Victor Vran - in D3, if a friend won't rush through the content for the first time with you, you have to play through really easy game for many hours, even on the highest difficulty possible (for your first character). Victor Vran allows enemies being easy on you only at the beginning - after a while you'll get hexes, which provide a difficulty system similar to Bastion, i.e. you pick which elements of the game get harder, to get higher experience gain as a reward.\n\nWhat's the main selling point of Victor Vran, is ubiquitous secret passages with chests and challenges. Each location has a few secret places and a set of five distinct challenges that aims to break player's single playstyle - the game openly want you to try all possible weapons and strategies, with tasks like "kill X anti-melee enemies with hammer", "beat the boss without using potions", "kill all enemies without using spells", or "kill hundred skeletons in 120 seconds". If you consider yourself being completionist, those will offer you a lot of entertainment for many hours.\n\nThe story of the game is nothing more than average ARPG filler, I don't even feel like I should talk about it with passion; only truly important thing about the story (besides nice static cutscenes) is the narrator. If you like narrators that want to mock you and make you laugh, you'll love the narrator there. Though every character besides the narrator is deadly serious in the game, the developers tried to be funny too much at some places, so expect the "arrow in the knee" joke or meeting GebaN.\n\nIf you don't like playing alone, you can play it with up to 3 friends at time on co-op, or you can visit PvP duelling arena. If you hate paying for DLCs, you can send a happy mail to developers, as they made all game DLCs free (Tome of Souls weapon, Cauldron of Chaos Map, Highlander outfit) - don't forget to install them if you are buying the game!\n\nI got surprised by the game's optimalisation, as it's running well even on low-end computers, and it has many graphic options and UI scaling. But nothing's perfect, once you get into zones with hundreds of enemies at one place (which is even in the first hours of the game, I hope you don't have arachnophobia), the game starts to lag badly.\n\nConclusion:Victor Vran is a good hack and slash RPG without complex features that offers entertainment for many hours, especially to completionists who expect huge amount of bonus tasks and challenges. Low variety of armor equipment and spells are compensated with good weapon variety and different skillset for each weapon type.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: My copy of Victor Vran was obtained for free - I won the game in a giveaway that have been sponsored by the developer. This fact hasn't changed my opinion about the game (and the review) in any way.\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","April 10","true","12.7"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","29","31","0","0"

The  gameplay is easy to pick up and yet it has some suprising depth. It's originality is a breath of fresh air in a genre that was beginning to get a little stale.

I can't wait to see what it will be like when its fully fleshed out but even at this early stage Victor Vran shines without glaring and has easily pulled me away from doing laps in Diablo in a vain search for the One True Gimlet of Envy or the Enchanted Gimcrack of Flatulence with the cone of annoyance buff.

If you’ve played Diablo, you know exactly how it will go.\nThe game plays equally good with both mouse + keyboard and a gamepad too.\nI’d even go as far as to say that Victor Vran plays very similar to Diablo 3 on consoles. Which in my opinion is a very good thing, since Blizz loves to polish their games.\nBut Victor Vran has enough things that’s different to make you play it.\nFirst of all, there’s no traditional classes in game. Which means that pretty much at any moment you can decide to switch to a different play style. In fact, I did that right in the middle of the dungeons, worked out pretty well!\nThe way that you customize your play style comes down to four things: weapons, demon powers, destiny cards and outfits.\n\nEach weapon type you’ll use, in addition to traditional ARPG stats, has it’s own set of skills. So, with shotgun you’ll have AOE blast, while with lightning gun you’ll have an attack that kinda chains mobs that are close enough together. You can have two weapons equipped at a time with a convenient switch button for them. But some weapons work better on different monsters, so it’s generally a good idea to carry your best ones for all types in inventory.\nDemon powers are sort of magic spells. And buffs, and auras, and lots of other things. It can be damage dealing power, buff that increases your stats temporarily, debuff that makes enemies simpler to kill, etc, etc. This stuff is actually pretty straightforward, you get the idea.\nYou can use demon powers when you have enough overdrive (something like barbarian rage in Diablo - increases on attacks). And you can as well only have two powers equipped at a time. And again - it’s a good idea to carry good ones with you as you might need to switch them for next boss (or mini-boss).\nDestiny cards are passive buffs (e.g. +% dmg or +% life steal) that you can equip at will in several available slots. Equipping them costs destiny points and you have a limited number of those. If you’d played Warframe - they feel a lot like mods in there.\nAnd the last one is outfits. I haven’t yet seen too many of those, but they do seem to alter the gameplay quite a lot (e.g. my first outfit made me gain overdrive over time instead of for attacking).\nYou can as well use variety of potions that’ll either do damage, apply debuffs to your enemies or buff you.\n\nThe enemy variety is quite large - almost every zone has some unique type of enemies that will make you sweat. And enemies can be pretty tough as well - almost all have different attack patterns, and when they are combined, you have to be pretty careful, or you’ll die.\nThe bosses are pretty fun too. I’d only beaten two so far, but they wasn’t easy and had quite a lot of tricks up their sleeve. Not quite Diablo 3 level, but very very close!\nOn top of all that the game has a very cool Van Helsing-like aesthetic which I personally enjoy quite a lot.\n\nDownsides right now:\n- No proper campaign (but that’s coming, just wait a bit)\n- Only 6 weapon types (again - more is coming in next patches)\nAnd that’s about it. Everything else is more or less perfect.\n\nYou can watch a bit more in-depth look at the game here:\nhttps://youtu.be/qYjNtkgXVuQ\n","April 4, 2015","true","6.8"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","0"

I present you Victor Vran!\nI was keeping an eye on this little game when it was on early access and I got it shortly after its release. I must say, I am not dissapointed.\n\nWHAT I FOUND INTERESTING\n♦It has up to 4 player story coop, so you are never bored. My friend purchased 4pack and we are having so much fun playing.\n♦No difficult RPG levelling, this game is friendly to all the players even casuals.\n♦Friendly controls. You can chose how you want to play the game - on the keyboard, gamepad or a classic Diablolike controls.\n♦Many ways to play - as you level up you get a change to change your characters outfit and with it its look and adjust the gameplay to you suitable playstyle. At the beginning of the game you can chose form the basic 4 outfits, but you can change it at any time when you get the chance. Each player outfit has different bonuses.\n♦Ability to set your own difficulty. In later play you will get access to "hexes". You can enable one or more of those to increase the difficulty of your play, and you can disable them at any time, or just play without them.\n\nWHAT I DONT LIKE\n○Might get repetetive after a while for some people. But there might be someone who will enjoy it anyway. Like me.\n○Bosses are not really a challenge when you play in coop. But it usually vary, depending on the boss. Some were very difficult even when playing together with friends.\n○Not very good enemy variation. You will encounter same enemies all over again.\n○Not so memorable characters in the story.\n\nMINOR STUFF\n+visuals\n+weird Voice that talks all the time and something cracks stupid joke, easter egg, reference or bad pun.\n+skeletons dancing Gangnam style\n\nIN THE END\nThis game is worth playing. If you dont like playing deep RPG of this genre, this is a very nice and welcoming game.\n\nDear developers. Thank you.","July 27, 2015","true","35.6"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","1"

I guess ill start with that too. Sooo both games are ARPG&Hack'nSlash (tho van helsing is more likely a clone of diablo, victor vran i wouldnt say so) Both games take place in some eastern-south european lands (Seriously Borgovia in VH and Zagrovia in VV  ^.^) ,there are vampires in both series. Also story of both games is all about saving the world, woo-hooo! (but i guess like 95% games of this kind is all about it, so...).\n\nNow... There are 2 reasons why i bought the game imidiately after its full release..\n1st: I really like hackn'slash genre. Plus this game looked really nice (i mean graphics and all)\n2nd: The game looks like its meant to be played on gamepad. And its quite rare in this genre. It was always all about button mashing with your mouse. And gotta tell you... this game gets even greater and  better if u are playing on gamepad. The possibility to dodge attacks, roll over fireballs, and jump through pulse waves is just great. If you are skilled and fast enough you can basically dodge it all :) First time its not all about how beffed up your hero is...\n\nNow lets talk something about hero development. Its not super great, but i find it pretty solid. If they polish it in some future paths it might get great :) There is no stats like strenght or agility, but instead you are getting destiny points, destiny card slots, or little max HP buffs. Destiny cards are passive bonuses. The more destiny points you have the more powerful cards you can equip. And there is plenty of them. Plus there are some legendary ones, that benefits you depends on weapon you are using at the time.\nItem properties in this game are pretty standard for Hacknslash (extra damage, crit chance, life steal, etc.)\n\nDevs mentions something about unique behaviour of enemies. I guess thats truth. Every single enemy has his own skills and moves (except the simplest ones). But... i would love to see more variety of enemies. Because in this state there is no many of them. Also the game is not that long. It would take less than 10 hours to complete if you rush through it.\nI love challenges, and hexes in this game. (hex makes the game more difficult, f.e. monster hits harder, or runs faster) That will let this game to stay alive for long. It would take a lot of time to complete them all, and they are really diverse. Also the difficulty level of many of them varies a lot. The toughest of them, are very difficult. I mean it :)\n\n\n+SUPER ENJOYABLE while playing on gamepad\n+pretty addicting\n+nice graphics\n+cool combat system\n+casual and challenging at once\n+challenges, hexes\n+Snakes on a Plane!\n\n\n\n-WORLD MAP!!! what did they think...\n-sometimes this kind of joking annoys me a bit :P","August 11, 2015","true","26.2"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","23","25","0","0"

Victor Vran fulfilled my expectations and even more so, went beyond them. The unique character customization allows for a vast amount of combinations between the Destiny Cards and Demon Powers, the transmutation system provides another option for unneeded loot and having zone specific challenges was a nice cherry on top. Oh did I mention you can jump and actually use it to dodge abilities?\n\nJust this evening I finished the story line and can say I'm still really interested in the game. With the help of unlocking Elite Challenges at the end of the game, I'm not left feeling like there's nothing to do. I have yet to even hit max level. The Bottomless Pit and PvP Arena were great add-ons to keep me busy as well. I really hope this game takes off even further with more additions and perhaps DLC.\n\nA suggestion I would bring up would be to have a secondary set of DC and DP (and maybe potions?) for when you switch your weapons, something like Item Sets. Some weapons work more well with certain DC's, DP's and Potions and to switch weapons mid fight means you're losing out on that potential, unless you really wanted to manually change everything.\n\nKeep up the awesome work guys. Looking forward to more content!\n\n**EDIT**\n\nJust to add that I liked this game a lot even when it had no voice-overs or Cinematics and just had text/placeholders. Literally the word "placeholder". With hearing the voice of Victor and the other characters it adds a whole other feeling to the game along with the cinematics.","July 26, 2015","true","64.2"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","23","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Timeraider/recommended/345180/","Timeraider","Timeraider","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Timeraider/","666 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFinally i feel that i've tried out enough to have an idea about this game.\nFirst time i played this game i went into a dungeon, saw 8 undead dancers do Gangnam style and recieved a shotgun.\nThats about the summary of the game.\n\n\n\nNow for the serious part :D\n\nFirst read this: http://steamcommunity.com/app/345180/discussions/0/617328415071899815/\n\nFIrst lets get rid of the cons so we have that done and over with:\n\n- Optimisation isnt yet where it fully should be probably. Regardless it still runs well enough to show off some sweet graphics. I myself can't play it on that high settings due to the fact that msaa costs a idiotic high amount of performance, while at he highest settings you do need it to compensate some of the sharpness of textures that might overdo it if you dont have msaa turned on. However this is as said just a small thing, it looks and plays fin on medium settings so ill just do that. Most of the optimisation is planned in 1.05\n\n- Though the amount of content certainly isnt scarce (havent done all content yet and probably will take a while more), i would guess like around 10 hours just for the normal exploring.. add running dungeons with curses (negative buffs etc. see it as hardmode)/all challenges will add alot more hours. There isnt any story added yet. This is only the areas for chapter 1 unlocked and challenges added to the areas, thats it for now. (still.. not that bad for this early into early acces release) More is coming as EA progresses\n\n\nNow.. those 2 things are rid off our minds, lets start with the pro's\n\n- Controls... wether you want a controller, wasd controls or mouse-driven.. its all there.\n\n- online co-op.. got added!\n\n- Graphics... yep.. they are available and not disappointing at all XD\n\n- Difficulty... While playing normally and having some potions with you, its reasonable doable... not really hard. The further you get, the harder it gets but still within reasonable limits. Then you start doing dungeons with curses active on you.. getting more difficult and then yo end up doing the highest level dungeons with curses on and suddenly you have to watch your toes because those monsters will come and kick your ♥♥♥ if you dont pay attention for a splitsecond :D\n\n- Skills...  It works like this. you have 2 weapons you can switch between. Each weapon has a basic attack and 2 skills. Aside from that you can also equip 2 skills (demon powers)(you start off with 1 slot). The weaponskills depend on the kind of weapon.. atm there are several kinds of weapons including hammers, lightning guns and more :D\n\n- Stats.. the usual kind of stats ....health, damage etc. etc. and the normal sidestats.. lifesteal, armor pen etc. etc.\n\n- Tactics and movement.. now we come to the part where it takes a surprising route.. there are several impressive features. One is the very nice dodgesystem, allowing you to dodge the more painfull attacks .. the other is the jump/walljump system. Yes.. you can jump.. you can jump over bushes and small walls.. but you can even go as far  as walljumping between walls to get to higher places or secret stashes.\n\n- Gameplay ... the game feels very responsive and enjoyable. It feels a bit like a Diablo game except in the fact that it doesnt really on only spamming stuff but also well-timed dodges and skill-uses :P\n\n- Talents ... there arent really any talents. What you have is 3 slots wherein you can store certain cards that give spcially additions. (explosions on overkill, extra lifesteal, frostblasts on crit etc. etc. etc.)\n\n- Early acces risk... this is a new part ill add to any review i make for early acces games. By this i do some research after the developers, the intention and the way they have set up the Early Acces.\nLooking at the games developed by this developer company, you will see alot of positive well-recieved games with high ratings. Overall this is a good rep-sheet. The developers do not seem to have much experience with a-rpg's yet.\nTheir roadmap seems very solid and actually achievable... i am happy to see some developers that aren't laying the bar 50 miles higher then they will ever get.\nSeeing what is available atm, how the developers respond to feedback, what they gave planned and what they have done before.. only con i would find is that i hope that if thy ever in any possible future release paid DLC for it... it did better be good since it seems that at some of their tropico dlc they really missed the plank.\nOverall i would give this Early Acces the risk-rating of 10/100 meaning the risk of these developers not adding all promised features, abandoning the game or ruining the game-experience in any possible way is really small.\n\n(0= a promised no risk, no chance on any negative feedback .. 100 = .. dont even think about buying it .. example.. War-Z would have gotten a 100 from me instantly if i would have been able to review without owning the game at the time, while Divinity: Original Sin would have recieved a score of 5 due to the amount of non-promised content added upon the promised content during their early acces)\n\nOverall it looks, feels and breathes the word "action-rpg". My experience with action-rpg's isnt THAT extensive so i will never be able to describe this game as extensive as some of the real Diablo/Torchlight/Baldurs gate etc. players...\nStill the game is fun to play, gets difficult later in the game, controls work perfect and very responsive and it has that Diablo-type sense of pride when you destroy a group of skeletons and it sets of a chainreaction of explosions.\n\nAlso if you want to see some gameplay (though poorly played like any reviewer :D) i would recommend this one since its compact and to the point:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqJFegU1B0","March 14, 2015","true","16.1"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","23","26","4","0"

"Overcharge" skills are basically like Ultimates that can be used to either buff, heal or damage and they will come in handy once the Multiplayer is implemented.\n\nNote: For supporting the Dev during Early Access, you get a neat piece of armour that will allow your "overcharge" to passively build instead of requiring you to build it via attacking.\n\nThe enemies are plentiful and the gameplay satisfying enough to keep me hooked, I'm looking forward to what this game will introduce as the months go on.

So easy you feel pretty silly playing it, or feel incredibly bored. However, things start to pick up, and you'll notice that you end up taking more damage. That of course comes with better loot. And more ways to customize your character and different ways to kill your enemies.\n\nEach weapon type comes with their own satisfying skill set. Usually a basic attack, an AOE attack, and a high damage attack. For example, Rapiers attack quickly, have a satisfying lunge/charge attack, and a presice high damage attack. Hammers have a powerful single attack, a charge up AOE slam attack, and a powerful Jump/teleporty attack. Scythes allow you daze enemies, absorb life, and come with an effective Whirlwind attack.  This really makes killing enemies fun!\n\nIt's very fun learning to play with weapons, and you can equip two at a time, and can easilly swap between them to perform some really fun attack combinations.\n\nWith your first character, don't fret too much when the game asks you which type of "class" you want to be if you want to play on the normal difficulty. Even if you choose the "wrong" kind, you'll still be having a lot of fun and continue to be effective in battle.\n\nAs you progress, the game offers a bunch of different types of enemies to kill. All ranging from various levels of difficulty. The maps come with their own set of challanges that are fun, rewarding, and completely optional.\n\nAs you level, you'll be able to customize your character in a variety of ways, weapons being the first way, but there are cards and demonic powers that you can swap in and out at any time. If you found a weapon that offers a high crit chance, you can swap out your original health or melee damage cards for crit chance cards that increase or cast certain spells when you land a crit. You can also swap out your demonic power from a healing aura to a diamond shield or teleport spell on the fly.\n\nThey did a good job to not punish you for customizing your character, and offered a wide range of ways to do so.\n\nDefinately recommended.","July 28, 2015","true","8.3"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/345180/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Victor Vran, from developer Haemimont Games, is an action role-playing game with entertaining gameplay elements that are a result of its bold design concepts. While the game begins slowly, it significantly improves as players level their characters and gain new abilities. It's not until players unlock all the gameplay basics that the game truly shines with its attempts at new concepts for the genre, such as a hex system to increase difficulty in levels. Yet the game faces tough competition in the action RPG genre with other games such as Diablo III, Grim Dawn and Path of Exile. Even if it doesn't have all the features of other genre titles, what it does contain is gameplay that is difficult to put down after hours and hours of slaying monsters, leveling up, and gaining more loot.\n\nThis action-RPG follows the story of Victor Vran, a wandering demon hunter in search of an old friend that went missing near the town of Zagorovia. You quickly learn the city and surrounding area have been taken over by demons and other monsters, making it an ideal place for demon hunters to investigate. Victor is then greeted by a disembodied voice, referred to as The Voice, which taunts Victor relentlessly. I won’t go into too much more detail since the story picks up the pace early but, I will say that The Voice is one of the best parts about the game. He brings comic relief to the dark and gloomy Gothic-esque setting, even going so far as to making some subtle jokes referring to Skyrim and The Stanley Parable. Moreover, The Voice’s dialogue is non-intrusive to the progression of the game, meaning the game doesn’t come to a screeching halt every time he wants to make a quip at our hero.\n\nThe main story is interesting and engaging, but seems somewhat inconsequential. I will admit this is very much a subjective opinion, but the game would have played out the same without a story; I can still hack and slash through mountains of demons and undead to reach the next zone without a reason to do so other than it’s fun to see if I can. The story just seemed to put me on an arbitrary path from one zone to the next.\n\nVictor Vran offers no specific classes to choose from but instead uses an equipment based skill system. This means there are no skill points earned to spec into particular attributes like crit chance, just weapon stats and destiny cards. These cards act like slottable skill points; each card has a point value and a passive effect. You start with a limited number of card slots and number of total points among slotted cards. I found this system was very useful when I wanted to try different build types, but after I found a play style I liked I only changed my cards when I found stronger versions of the ones I already had. I appreciate the thought they gave to trying this method of character progression, but it lacks the kind of depth or variety I want from an RPG.\n\nOn a similar note is the demon power system. You start with a single slot and quickly unlock a second through leveling. These powers can drop as loot and and have varying levels of rarity like all the other lootable items. Of the ones I was able to find, some were definitely more useful than others. The offensive powers didn’t seem to do enough damage later in the game and one in particular requires you to be stationary to channel the ability. In a game with waves of enemies, you might be able to see the problem with this; standing still is a death sentence and the damage from the column of fire you summon doesn’t mitigate that at all. I mostly stuck to defensive demon powers like the time bubble and diamond armor since my weapons did enough damage on their own.\n\nThe weapons, in fact, are the core of the gameplay. They decide how fast you’re attacking and the other two skills you can equip. Unlike most RPGs where you might unlock certain abilities with skill points, Victor Vran has you switching abilities every time you switch weapon types. While this means you can’t specifically upgrade weapon skills, it does mean you can change out your abilities at will. This was actually very useful for taking on different zones and bosses; sometimes a horde of skeletons needed to be cleared with the smash attack of a giant hammer, other times attacking a boss at range using a pistol was the safest choice. These are all personal choices of course, but I felt the level design was nudging me to use the skills from a particular weapon over the skills of another.\n\nSo now you have a demon hunter with a pistol and a hammer who can shoot flames and slow down ranged attacks, but how does it size up to the waves of enemies you’re fighting? The game claims to have a “huge variety in monster behaviour,” but it really boils down to melee and ranged. Most of them, regardless of attack method, simply charge you head on like the 28 Day Later zombies while others dart around like a cracked out house fly. Others yet simply dance around you and just want you to dance with them.\n\nHonestly the monster variety seems exhausted pretty quick and you learn how to fight around their mechanics, but the real test of skill are the boss battles. I was getting a little bored grinding through waves of skeletons and wraiths until I came across the first boss a couple hours in. It was a giant spider amid hundreds of eggs that hatched more spiders. It was a real turning point in the game for me. I wasn’t just fighting a wave of enemies, but now a wave of enemies and a giant spider that could slow and stun me. It was the first time I had to think about how to handle the whole situation instead of just hack/slash/shoot my way through. I would even go so far as to say that battle and the subsequent boss battles are the best test of combat and are what kept me wanting to play more.\n\nThe art style is reminiscent of Diablo 3 and other popular isometric RPGs, but that’s mostly because the fantasy Gothic setting is a fairly well established style at this point. The character art during dialogue is very well done and depicts each character’s role. A nice touch that I appreciate is when you change Victor’s outfit, his portrait for dialogues is updated. The textures and models are good enough for how high the camera sits, but honestly the combat is usually so fast paced you rarely get time to check out how good the monsters look. What matters is that you can tell a fireball-shooting skeleton from a melee skeleton and you can do that with ease. Victor Vran might not incorporate Nvidia Hair Physics, but it doesn’t hurt to look at.\n\nThe music, on the other hand, is more than adequate. I found myself humming the eerie themes throughout the day after playing the night before. The score fits the setting perfectly and provides a great backdrop for pummeling waves of undead creatures in an overrun city. The sound effects are good too, giving the feeling of impact for your weapons. I found this especially true for the ranged weapons and the extra punch from landing a crit.\n\nVictor Vran is a solid action-RPG, no doubt about it. I was hoping for more depth and permanence in the skill system like you might find in more traditional RPGs, but I can appreciate the choices the developers made given the core mechanic of the game: fast-paced combat with a variety of weapons and enemies. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of action-RPGs with more of a focus on combat and less on character building.","April 8","true","32.4"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","1"

But what you have is a very good Action-RGP, with focus on action, it has one of the best combat systems in an ARPG, I have experienced. The draw back is a more arcade-style approach to character building, so there are no class-system, but you can change you skills and weapons of you character with different skills cards (Destiny Cards), so you one second can play with a big smashing hammer and the next a pulverising shotgun.\n\nFirst you control your character with the wasd keys and mouse. You can also use a gamepad. You can also roll duck, jump and even wall jump, this make for a very interesting and fun gameplay although the dynamics wears off after a while as with other games . The atmosphere in the game is good, the graphics are very beautiful and there is a lot of areas. Every area has five challenges, if you complete can get more experince, and loot. The hunt for loot is one thing this game does well, and with the challenges is what keeps this game going. Not because there is a lot, but you appreciated more when you get it, and to find that piece you need to fit with your skill cards.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/killzaar/recommended/345180/","killzaar","[503] Dead.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/killzaar/","511 products in account","The action-RPG genre has certainly had it’s share of highs and lows. While Diablo and it’s sequels, to greater or lesser degrees, have largely been seen as the high-water mark of the genre, plenty of other contenders have certainly tried to match it. Path of Exile and the Torchlight games have had the most success, but with the release of Victor Vran, it’s safe to say there’s now another fighter in the ring.\n\nVictor Vran features about as much story as one would expect from an ARPG. While it lacks some of the beauty found in Diablo 3‘s cutscenes, it makes up for it with some decent voice acting and great music. Again, probably due to budgetary limits, nothing quite matches up to Diablo‘s grandeur, but fits nicely around what Torchlight has been capable of.\n\nPerhaps most distracting is the presence of some of the voice actors. The same actor who voiced Geralt in The Witcher series voices Victor Vran. The titular character is a monster hunter in a steam-punk inspired, medieval world. It’s distractedly similar to The Witcher in many ways, not to the point of imitation, but more in a sense of accidental ode. Luckily, few are sticking with Victor Vran for it’s story.\n\nThe game begins with a tutorial of sorts. You learn the basics of movement and combat. Players are given the option of using either a mouse and keyboard or a controller (I went with the controller). Both options have their limitations, as one would expect, but I found the controller implementation to be well-handled. Again, it doesn’t quite match up to what Blizzard was able to accomplish with Diablo 3 on consoles, but it’s more than serviceable. In fact, the console ports of Diablo 3 always felt a bit more arcadey than their PC counterpart. Victor Vran‘s controller utilization feels much more in line with the mouse and keyboard’s more strategy-lite feeling.\n\nFollowing the tutorial, you’re given the option of choosing one of three classes. All classes are still Victor, but they play decidedly different. There’s the wizard-like character, who specializes in magic, a rogue-like character with quick, but light, attacks and a specialization in distance-based attacks, and the warrior-like character. Seeing as how the tutorial was all done from the warrior’s perspective,t he sudden change was jarring, and did little to encourage me to explore options outside of the warrior class.\n\nActual combat is fast and fluid. Each weapon has it’s own basic attack and two limited special attacks. With the press of a button, you’re able to swap between two different weapons. This adds a lot of strategy to the mix. For example, fighting a powerful monster might require the use of multiple special abilities. Thanks to the two weapon system, you could use the two specials of weapon A, switch weapons, and then use the specials of weapon B. Adding to this is the Demon abilities, which are dictated by an Overcharge meter. As you kill enemies, your Overcharge meter fills. Once full, Victor can unleash a powerful Demon attack which lays waste to hordes of monsters at once. Once you’ve leveled Victor up enough, you’re able to have multiple Demon attacks on hand. Demon attacks can be swapped out for others that are picked up from killing enemies.\nThe biggest issue I run into in loot heavy games such as this (and Diablo, Borderlands, Torchlight, etc.) is that most of the loot feels unimportant, since it’s less powerful than what I’ve already equipped. I tend to find myself sorting through garbage to find pearls. Unfortunately, Victor Vran isn’t really any different. It does add “Uncommon” versions of Common items, and that certainly adds to the excitement, but only to minimal effects.\n\nPerhaps what Victor Vran does best for the genre is in how it increases Victor’s levels. It puts an end to much of the min-maxing found in so many other RPGs, and gives you a set upgrade based on your level. For example, at level 15, your ability to wear various outfits can now have larger effects on how you play. At each level you’re given the choice between three different items which, generally speaking, cater to whatever you unlocked by leveling-up. This does away entirely with the tedious nature of leveling found in most RPGs. There’s no need to sit and worry about the choice you made being the wrong one, and instead allows you to just enjoy the action and manage your inventory.\n\nVictor Vransidesteps traditional sidequests, which tend to get messy and distract from the main quest. Instead, each map has 5 bonus objectives which are all fairly simple in nature, even if some are frustrating to complete. Some examples would be finding all of the hidden treasure chests, killing x-many monsters in x-many seconds, or killing x-many monsters with a specific weapon. The payout you get for completing each is substantial enough that you’re driven to actually complete them.\n\nVictor Vran does little to set itself apart from the likes of Diablo, Torchlight, and the Van Helsing series. Instead, it chooses to focus on tight gameplay with excellent controls and does away with a lot of the tediousness of the genre. It’s a game that has benefitted entirely from the Early Access program and is a shining example of what can be done when giving players access to games early.\n\n4/5 Stars\n\nRead more at Gizorama.com\n\n**Review copy provided by developer**","July 24, 2015","true","11.0"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","27","35","0","0"

My friend and I purchased it while it was on sale and we beat it in around 6 hours, we where not speed running or anything, just going at a normal pace.\n\nFor those of you who want to buy this game, I would say don't buy it if you are not a diehard RPG Action fan. This game has around 25 different mobs that you will see over and over and over again. The fights are extremely lazy and the dungeon design is very lazy.\n\nThe fights are all the same where you spam a few buttons and slam a health potion down every once in a while. Many mobs in this game actually respawn right after you kill them as well, leading you to spend a much longer time just attacking the same mobs over and over and over again.\n\nNothing in this world changes when you do anything, when you kill the main boss of an area, the mobs do not dissapear, no one will come out and thank you. At best you will get a thank you from the queen and she will send you off again to fight yet more mobs.\n\nWhen you die, it means nothing. Die whenever you want, no penalties. In fact we actually would kill oursevles just to teleport back to the hub faster.\n\nThis game doesn't do anything other than make you fight mobs. The only thing you do is kill mobs and do fetch quests and challenges relating to mobs.\n\nThe NPC's are lifeless and the crafting system is poorly explained, so be sure to look up how to craft or you might lose valuable items.\n\nThe combat felt solid, but then again it was extremely barebones. Some enemies looked cool and had nice art design but it would have been nice to see more than 25 different types of mobs over and over.\n\nThe ending of the game was extremely lackluster, no thanks for playing, no major moment, there is a short cutscene and then you are left standing in silence.\n\nSo, this game from my view (Which is very jaded) is not worth the money you spend on it. At most I would say this game is worth around 5 to 10 dollars.\n\nIf you are someone like me who has played a lot of RPG / massive multiplayer online games, this will be the same thing you have played before and you will not get any fun out of it.","July 24, 2015","false","6.7"," 348 of 598 people (58%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","58","348","598","29","44"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nanobang/recommended/345180/","nanobang","Nanobang","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nanobang/","160 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nVictor Vran is a beautiful game.   Not only in how it looks, but in how it plays.  It hits that all-too-uncommon sweet-spot of video-games: it remains challenging enough to be rewarding, but not so difficult as to be discouraging.   It is a lovingly realized, flawlessly crafted, deeply immersive experience.\n\nThe controls are quick and responsive on both K & M and gamepad.   The animations, are elegant without being laborious and don't get in the way of the action.   Combat is straightforward carnage that demands as much tactical consideration as quick reflexes.   I can't get away with just button mashing because I'll die.   Instead of combos, there are three types of attacks unique to each weapon class: a quick attack, something involving range, and some sort of massive attack.  Large melees take on the look and feel kaleidoscopic saloon brawls –- colorful crashing motion.\n\nEverything about the character of Victor Vran is customizable.  The game has taken a fresh approach to skills/perks, allowing me to shape Victor's fighting style through the nuanced interplay of perks, powers, weapons and potions.  I've personally settled on a handful of favorite weapons I rotate through, depending upon the situation.   I'm forever tweaking and re-working my perks and powers, ever refining and improving them.\n\nWeapons (and everything else) and their powers are upgradeable through the process of "transmutation.", over the course of the game I've upgraded my favorite sword from it's original green (uncommon) state, through a gold (rare) state, to its present almighty purple (legendary) state.   Like the rest of the game, upgrading and modifying items meticulously well balanced without resorting to arbitrary level limits.   Upgrading items is a matter of money and other items, which are consumed in the process.   Both money and items drop from enemies and environment alike but never so abundantly that upgrading is ever quick or easy.\n\nComparisons to Kingdoms of Amalur: The Reckoning seem natural.  Both games excell at visceral, flowing, dynamic combat.   But I find combat in Victor Vran delightfully more challenging than KOA.   And if I want to make VV even more challenging, instead of the age-worn “Easy,” “Normal,”  “Difficult” settings, I can choose to use so-called "Hexes."   Each Hex adds a different kind of buff to the enemies (or debuff to Victor), so by using some, none, or all of the Hexes, I can modify the flavor of difficulty, the form it will take.  In return for the added difficulty (and fun) each Hex also significantly increases the amount of XP earned.\n\nThe devs are productive, responsive, and communicative.  This game is a well made gem.","July 11, 2015","true","73.2"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","1"

Victor Vran is an interesting game in that it functions similarly to other ARPG's.. with elements of platforming and spectacle fighting. There are no classes, only weapons which offer different abilities. You -can- try to play as a caster of sorts, but no such thing exists in this game. It's either slash up your foes with some kind of sword or gigantic hammer, or burst them down with a shotgun or grenade mortar (or, indeed, a chicken cannon).\n\nThe story is pretty simple but what piques interest is the narration. It's incredible, really. Voiced by the man who performs the voice acting for Geralt (of The Witcher series), imbued with some additional sarcasm, there are some hilarious lines throughout which I really don't want to spoil for you.\n\nThere aren't complex talent builds or anything in lieu of other games in the genre but the simplicity really seems to work in its favour - this game isn't trying to have much depth in the passive/active talent tree game. Where the depth comes is from the combat, which, despite the fact that most people may see it as "babby's first ARPG", is really bloody fun.\n\nIt's not perfect, but in my opinion it's absolutely worth a look whether you want to get into ARPG's, or enjoy them already. And if you don't like it, you can always refund it.","July 30, 2015","true","9.5"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","15","15","2","0"

Gameplay is addictive as hell, slightly reminds of Gauntlet gameplay, which is a good thing, there are not enough these kind of games out there.\n\n-Story is...good...lot of cliché  (Help the queen, save the friend, meet pretty girl on the way...)  but oh well, it works and it isn't boring, so it's good. 6/10\n\n-Gameplay is smooth as hell, a lot to do, it's addicting and a lot of weapon variatons and combinations keeps the gameplay fresh, gotta adjust specific weapons against specific types of enemies, you must not, but it can help! A strategic element in an ARPG game is really cool! A few secrets to discover here and there, always nice! Little more AI for enemies would be nice or more variatons of them! 9/10\n\n-Combat also smooth as hell, real time action done right! You only dodge attacks that you actually dodge by using your gaming reflexes! Wish there were some combo attacks with certain kind of weapon-combos equipped(like sword+gun combo moves] or something, or a few more skills or something just to have more freedom of strategy! 8/10\n\n-Performance-\nGame runs smooth at 60fps at all times with ultra settings with not the best graphic card out there so 10/10 there.\n\nAdditional comments:\nThe game art is good looking, it's not depressing, dark and gloomy like  a lot of RPGs are, so that can be a fresh breath of air for a change.

I'm racking my brain, and I simply can't come up with another game of any genre that manages to balance the importance of itemization and player skill so well.\n\nBy off-loading some of the mechanical depth onto skilled play, the game is able to keep the build systems remarkably straightforward, tight and responsive. At the same time, because the manual skill depth ceiling is meaningfully high, investment can be found beyond just getting all the best gear you can find. This also means items appropriate to the player's skills and playstyle are more valuable than just what is "best".\n\nAn example of Victor Vran's elegant design: the game's Destiny cards. These are akin to the "perk" systems found in many games, and the player is allotted a certain amount of points with which to equip them. More powerful cards require more points, and yet the cards are balanced enough that low level cards retain their value at high levels, particularly as the player is able to stack them together. Again, the end effect is that build choices have more to do with enhancing the player's skills than they do with defining them.\n\nOn top of all this, the ability to switch out cards and equipment on the fly (no visiting town to respec, or cumbersome cool downs in-between) makes this game's build system more flexible, player friendly, and open to systems exploration than is usually found in games such as these (Note to Devs: Please keep this going forward!). And this comes around to skilled play once again--Victor Vran is able to do this because it doesn't need to rely on enforcing player choice, sub-optimal or no, to inflate investment time requirements.\n\nAll that said, it should be noted that how the end game will work remains to be seen. I've managed to hit the current level cap twice now in the 9 hours I've played this game as of this review, and if the level cap at release remains a low 20 (as per the Devs' roadmap post), much will rely on just how high the player skill depth ceiling will turn out to be at that point. Worst case scenario: end game gear that requires the player to skill-grind prohibitive amounts of challenges to unlock. And, of course, nothing is known about what the content will be like in terms of story, characterization, etc.\n\nIn summary: smart mechanics, meaningful skilled play in an aRPG package. If you like substantial build choices packaged with challenging top-down action a la Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light or Dungeon Siege 3, you'll probably enjoy this game.","February 28, 2015","true","27.6"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

I've not played them, so this was a fresh experience for me gameplay wise. I find Victor Vran quite relaxing while occasionaly being interrupted by boss fights that live up to the title. There is something really fun about destroying huge groups of enemies while at the same time attempting to watch for the stronger ones mixed in that can quickly destroy your game if you get over confident and start button mashing.\n\nThe map is large enough and covered with areas that you will hover over to see the various feats available such as "Kill 70 undead without getting hurt" or "Find all the Secrets". You will instantly teleport to each area upon selection. Victor has the ability to valut off of walls, allowing him to reach secret areas that are occasionally scattered throughout the game though there is not a heavy influence on this ability that I can see so far. You can finish each area without completing all of the tasks, go back later, or try again to finish it completely.\n\nThe variety of weapons, treasures, monsters, abilities and tasks are what make up the core of this game. The prime enjoyment for me comes from the interesting weaponry and how I can adapt it to the monsters in a certain area. Swords, rifles, shotguns, scythes and more are combined with effects ranging from fire, time dilation, or electrocution to decimate the swarms of spiders, skeletons, mages, ghosts, and more. The storyline is a little weak but still there and complete. There is occasional voice acting spread throughout the game but also a little bland. The addition of a companion "voice" who is only there to torment, joke, or hint on occasion seemed like an afterthought and could have been better developed or left out completely.\n\nOverall I really enjoy the game and feel like I can quickly fall back on it for some monster smashing fun while progressing along a storyline that I'm only remebering bits of here and there. If it is on sale I suggest buying it. The gameplay is good fun so far!","May 9","true","11.9"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

Total Biscuts WTF review sums up the game nicely if you wanna check that out on youtube.\n\nIts a more arcade feeling ARPG, one that for the first time ever, im finding myself using a 360 controller to play, rather than the mouse and keyboard (and im loving it).\n\nPlus..Geralt! I cant help but chuckle every time the voice actor for your character talks.\n\nGame feels rock solid, graphics are pleasing to the eyes and combat is a lot of fun. My only gripe is the way the controller navigates some of the UI menus, like the inventory screen. I often find myself selecting things I dont want. Nothing to keep me from enjoying the game however.","July 29, 2015","true","18.1"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/athravan/recommended/345180/","athravan","Athravan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/athravan/","863 products in account","Witty Hack n Slash Co-Op Fun! - Recommended.\nVictor Vran is an action based hack n slash ARPG. It is fairly simple; with three main active skills, three secondary skills (weapon swap), two special abilities and two potions. Everyone plays Victor Vran as a character, so in co-op mode, you're running around with your double. Outfits make you look slightly different, and choose your "class", but class provides a static bonus that can change the way you play in fairly minor ways, rather than any skillset. Instead, customization comes from each weapon having it's own abilities, and you can pick and choose which weapon you use. In fact, you will need to use specific weapons for specific scenarios and have to learn the skillsets of all of them if you want to complete any bonus objectives. There are dozens of different runes (spells), and then there is an interesting collectible card system, which is basically a small way of customizing your powerups depending on what the rest of your build is. So it is definitely a simple system - but not as shallow as it may initially appear, with the ability for two different Victor's to have quite different playstyles. Playing through with a co-op partner, we never ended up with the same build and we both liked different spells and weapons. I enjoyed being "encouraged" to change up my comfort zone to max out stars on an area, but was never forced, since you can complete the entire storyline and every map without doing the bonus objectives.\n\nBonus objectives add challenge and replayability to every map, some of them are very hard, some are very easy. Each map has secrets, most of which are fairly easy to find, but do require you to pay attention. You can activate different map-wide abilities to up the challenge, such as taking periodic damage, mobs hitting harder, or moving faster, and then challenges are things like finding secrets, not using special powers, not healing, not dying, defeating enemies with a certain weapon, or timed speed runs.\n\nCombat is fluid and responsive, very action-packed with combos and colourful animations and special effects. Weapons are progressive and upgradeable, with epic items having interesting special effects - often centered around being fun and different rather than overpowered, which is nice.\n\nThe story itself is a little bit meh and predictable, but the narrator is very well voice acted. Victor himself is quite dark and a wee bit emotional and dramatic, but the narrator is tongue-in-cheek amusing. Dry wit, peppered with pop culture, puns and meme's - many of which made me groan a little. The game definitely panders to those who will get the references, and whilst at times I facepalmed a little at the jokes, most of the time it had me smiling as well, and certainly was a different take on telling a story. I love to experience something unique in storytelling,and this definitely achieved that.\n\nHaving completed the main storyline, I don't feel much incentive to go back and 100% the areas right now - but might pick it up in future to play with friends as the co-op is seamless drop in drop out, so it would be very easy to return to with another partner. It took me around 13 hours to complete the main story and every map - but I could see it taking two to three times that if I wanted to five star everything. Overall it is a fairly simple but very fun, well presented game that I thoroughly enjoyed and would be happy to recommend.","February 18","true","13.7"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","2"

As this game is currently on sale in early access version, it shows so far enormous potential.\n\nIf you enjoyed playing Diablo and Van Helsing, Victor Vran is a must try. Big variety of monsters to slash either with melee weapons such as swords, rapiers, hammers and scythes or you can use shotguns and mortars for your distance arsenal.  It goes without saying that all weapons have their own characteristics and level of damage they can inflict to your adversaries.\n\nStacks of potions and powers to help you go through each level and one of my favourite powers is the Boomerang, a massive purple boomerang that hits your enemies twice on the way out and back. Absolutely marvellous stuff!!\nYou will also pick up destiny cards; these cards are very useful as you will be able to add or modify your character attributes.\n\nDifferent ways to level up your character, of which the obvious one is every time you kill an enemy you get experience points, but you will be able to get higher value points if you achieve challenges within the levels.\n\nThe available playing levels are well designed and quite challenging as far as you progress. Make sure you collect as many items as possible, including gold coins so you can upgrade your arsenal with the traders.\n\nGraphically, Victor Vran looks good, runs smoothly and I have not encountered issues so far.\n\nThe only negative is if you are using the keyboard and mouse as your controls, it is a bit sluggish.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Fairly large and well designed levels with interesting monsters\n-	Plenty of weapons and other goodies at your disposal\n-	Online mode\n-	Challenging\n-	Achievements\n-	Trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n-	  Controls need to be twigged a bit especially if you are using the keyboard and mouse\n\nI really enjoyed this game so far and thoroughly recommend it. I am looking forward to the final version.\n\n8/10\n\nMORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HERE\n\nFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE","July 10, 2015","true","15.7"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","21","28","0","1"

Twisting elements of the genre in a good way, the game takes a more compact approach with skills and RPGs elements, but does it in a way that adds complexity to battle and having to deal with different combat situations within it. It's a case of subtractions in the right areas while putting additions in other areas, like adding actions like jumping and various other skills. While it's not a lootfest that you'd expect out of games like Torchlight, and the enemies do get repetitive, hard mode is a real challenge and was an enjoyable time throughout, with the different weaponry playing so differently. Good boss battles, good environments and pieces, and good gameplay all around. The worst thing is the story, which is made up for by the voice that comes with you and narrates the game in a comical way. Absolutely worth it for $20 dollars.\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nWeaponry works so differently, and forces you on hard difficulty to use all the different weapons in each of the different situations.\nThe voice that accompanies you is the shining element of the story and makes you want a real life version of him to narrate what is going on with your life. The interactivity here is pretty darn good.\nEach enemy group is something you have to take seriously on hard mode, and I love that. No weak groups or fodder here.\nOn normal mode, hexes add a good amount of on the fly adjustable difficulty, and if you want a challenge, you'll get it on hard mode.\nGood amount of customization with the different demon powers, destiny cards, and armor types.\nBosses feel reasonably different from each other and stand out.\nGreat environments and attention to little details.\n-:\nThey could have used a bit more enemy types in the end, even with the variations to the type that they had.\nStory could have used a little bit more to it, it takes a backseat despite having an interesting narrative with it.","August 3, 2015","true","28.6"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jimmy1805/recommended/345180/","Jimmy1805","Jimmy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jimmy1805/","1607 products in account","The Circle of Loot\n\nBaldur's gate, Diablo, Torchlight, you know where you stand with a good action RPG.\n\nYou build your character, enter the  game world and hack and slash your way through hordes of monsters on a quest for lovely loot, loot which will make you more powerful, so you can take down more bad guys and get even more lovely loot.\n\nIt's a tried and tested format, it works and for the most part Victor Vran sticks to the staples of the genre, but is does bring a few interesting idea's of its own to the table.\n\n\nVictor of Rivia\n\nWhen you dive into Victor Vran the first thing you'll notice is the voice of Victor himself.\nYou're going to recognise it, at least you will if you've played the Witcher games recently.\n\nEvery ones favourite white haired witcher is voiced by an actor called Doug Cockle, Doug has now bought his talents to bear by giving voice to Victor Vran.\nWhich is great, he's a talented guy, but I did struggle with it a little, if only because Victor Vran is the first game I've sank a decent amount of time into following completion of The Witcher 3.\n\nThe problem I had was that every time Victor opened his mouth I heard the Witcher speaking which had the undesired effect of distracting me from Victors world and reminding me of Geralts.\nIt's only a little thing but when the small voice in your head keeps asking "What's Geralt doing here?" it can't help but break the immersion a little.\n\n\nPadding around Zagoravia\n\nThe next thing you'll probably think is:\n"Hey, there's no camera zoom" closely followed by "These controls are weird"\nBoth of which are true.\n\nThe first thing I tried to do in game was zoom the camera out by scrolling the mouse wheel, but instead of the camera moving as I'd expected, Victor did a backwards roll, which of course led to the second thought "These controls are weird".\n\nWell the default mouse controls are weird anyway.\nThis is easily fixed in the game options but I'd strongly recommend playing with a controller if you have one. It makes a world of difference to the feel of the game.\n\nUnfortunately the inflexible camera is not so easily fixed.\nThe ability to pan the camera up and down as well as zoom in and out would have made navigating the world Haemimont Games have created a much simpler task.\n\n\nVictor Vran Helsing\n\nYou'll be playing as the self titled Victor Vran, he looks a lot like Van Helsing doesn't he?\nAnyway...\nVictor is demon hunter, he's not a mage, not a paladin or a priest, he's not even a vampire slayer, he's a demon hunter.\nThere's no class selection here, Geralt was a Witcher, Mario was a Plumber, Victor is a Demon Hunter, that's just who he is.\n\nHaving said that, this game does still have an element of class customisation, it's just more subtle than you'll  probably be used to from other ARPG's you've played.\n\n\nThe Clothes Make The Man\n\nYou will, quite literally start tailoring your character from the very beginning of the game.\nAfter you've finished the brief tutorial by way of rotating the camera and squishing a few spiders you'll be given a choice of three outfits, each one will slightly change the way your character generates "overdrive".\n\nWhat's overdrive?\nThat's your "Mana", the resource you use when you're spell casting or rather "using your demonic powers", but we'll talk about that later.\n\nSo you'll be given the option of three outfits, Hunter, Cavalier or Vigilante.\n\nThe Hunter outfit generates overdrive when you're damaged.  (This is the balanced play option).\n\nVigilante focuses on armour and only grants overdrive when you land a critical hit (this is your "warrior" focused play style).\n\nCavalier generates overdrive automatically over time. (This gives a little more emphasis towards spell casting).\n\nDon't make the mistake of thinking you can play as a mage though, there's no class selection remember, you're a demon hunter, you gain demonic abilities (spells) as you play through the game but you are limited to only having two of these equipped at any one time.\n\nThis is a hack and slash title, you can use magic to supplement your slashing and hacking but it can't replace it.\n\n\nProgress for the Victor\n\nYou can further tweak your character to suit your play style as you progress through the game, there's no RPG style skill set to level here though, you  manipulate your available abilities through the weapons, powers and destiny cards you equip. This isn't as limiting as it first sounds, there are plenty of variations you can try out. It's a fresh and interesting approach to character progression, it just takes a little getting used to.\n\n\nWeapon of Choice\n\nThere are plenty of weapons for you to loot or buy in the game, each type bringing its own flavour to combat.\n\nThe Rapier is ideal if you're looking for some fast "staby, staby" action.\n\nThe sword is your hack and slash staple, it's a little slower than the Rapier but swinging it around will damage multiple enemies if they're bunched up tight.\n\nThere's the scythe for some wider spread slashing  mayhem and the hammer for some slow and heavy squishing.\n\nThese are just the melee weapon types, there are various shotguns, electric zappers etc. to choose from for your ranged attacks too.\n\nEvery weapon comes with a standard attack and two special attack abilities, each of which is distinctive and noticeably different between weapon types.\nYou can equip two weapons at a time (once you've progressed far enough to unlock this ability) and switching between them is quick and easy so you'll have multiple options available to suit whatever situation you find yourself in.\n\n\nMight and Magic the Gathering\n\nMagic in the game takes the form of Demonic Powers,  again there are plenty to pick up throughout the game but as I said earlier, you can only equip two at a time so you're not going to able to play through Victor Vran solely as a spell wielding mage\n\nWhatever your characters wardrobe and equipment you're going to need to get your hands dirty with some melee combat.\nHowever the spells offer some satisfying options in combat to supplement your might with a blade, whether it's raining down meteors on unsuspecting enemies or throwing up a shield to the damage those endless hordes are throwing at you.\n\nDestiny cards serve as the passive ability mechanic in the game.\nYou can equip up to five of these cards (depending on your level) which grant various passive abilities from increased health to damage bonuses which will further customise your character to suit your play style.\nThey're a nice touch and give a tired mechanic a fresh feeling.\nI like destiny cards.\n\n\nLocation, Location, Vocation.\n\nThis is a real hack and slash title which follows a well trodden path and apart from the quirky character "progression" it plays exactly as you would expect it too.\n\nYou have a home hub (The castle) and travel to various locations to deal with the horrible hordes that reside there.\nThere's no open world here though, you select a location from the map and instantly appear there ready take on the demonic dwellers within.\n\nHacking the horrors is a huge amount of fun, the different weapon types and their respective special attacks are all satisfying to use and help to keep the combat fresh (although it can still start to feel a little repetitive if you're playing through a marathon session.)\n\nThere are secret locations to be found too which will contain treasure chests full of looty goodness, often these will need you to use a rare and unusual ability, the ability to jump...\n\n\nVictor Vran Halen  (You might as well Jump!)\n\nThat's right, Victor Vran is an ARPG with allows you to Jump!\nIt's a really nice touch and not one you...

First of all, everything I said below still stands (except bugs...the game is exceptionally clean).  This game is a gem and you should get off your ♥♥♥ and buy it. Haemimont has continued to tweak the balance of the game and it continues to improve (even in areas where it already felt pretty darn good). And there's more coming: the Tome (a caster weapon), more multiplayer stuff, and something every game should have, an expansion featuring Motorhead. Seriously, if you don't like this I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ to do with you.\n\nA really promising ARPG, now content complete and just in the phase of polish (of which it already has an abundance).  Are there bugs?  Yes, but they're pretty few and pretty far between.  Do the prevent the game from being fun?  Hell no. This game has a great, engaging single-player campaign and is just balls-out fun to play with your friends. There's a really great feel to the control scheme they've put together for this game, and it's very much at home on your living room TV.  Good looking visuals with a unique Eastern/Slavic style totally in keeping with the whole vampire epic storyline, surprisingly good voice acting (surprising because I'm always surprised when voice acting isn't awful), and great weapon mechanics make for a ton of quality gameply.

Satisfying, fast-paced gameplay that requires reflex and agility - you need to move, roll and jump (yes, you can jump, you can also bounce off walls to get to secret areas) a lot on the battlefield, as huge groups of enemies easily surround you. Interesting and well thought character development - instead of choosing skills and investing points in stats, you equip new weapons, spells and destiny cards that provide special bonuses and modifiers. You can change them any time, so your character is able to adapt to every situation in an instant.

Legendary items are a random chance from transmuting epics\n- Demonic powers transmute into a random other power.\n\nIt's a really close call, but, at the end of the day, I can't recommend the game because of the horrendous scaling that ends up making combat at higher levels just not fun.

It's an action RPG, but it's not. It's fast. You move with WASD. You can jump (and double jump off walls). The abilities are aimed by the mouse (which is never used for movement). All of the levels have challenges to do (like completing them without taking damage). When you get to level 12 you start to unlock hexes that make the game harder but give benefits like increased XP. You customize your character through various types of items (weapons, spells, and "cards" - all of which can be swapped out whenever you want - so if you're looking to grind a "build" that's not what this game is). You'll find yourself swapping around weapon types a lot and trying out a lot of things, or if you're like me always using whatever item gives you the best item/gold find bonuses.\n\nI've been playing 3 or 4 hours now, and intend to continue. How many of the abilities and customization options have I already seen? I honestly don't know. Will this game be worth playing for weeks or months to come? I don't know. I have no idea if the multiplayer works well because I haven't tried it yet. What I do know is that with the 40% off sale this is an $11 very well spent.\n\nThe negatives? Mostly that it's not complete yet. What I've seen so far is really good, but there are various things currently missing (like difficulties above "normal"). I believe the missing things are supposed to be added soon, but even without them there's plenty of fun to be had.","June 13, 2015","true","21.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

It like Torchlight or Diablo, you fight enemies, collect weapons, cards, spells and some costumes, aswell as put on "Hexes" which make the game greatly harder for a bigger reward. For example one hex makes your character lose health periodically. Its a great game to play for a while and grind your character.

You can't play that way from the start but you can get there in a few hours: just choose a Cavalier outfit (you get to do that once you complete the "tutorial" mission) and  improve your Overdrive regeneration as much as possible. For that, try to get as many "Tower" Destiny Cards as you can. (Check the Destiny Card vendor often.) Aways use weapons with "Zealous" affix. At level 16 you can use the Transmutaion feature to combine 3 same level Tower cards into a higher-level one, and if you get a Legendary (purple) Destiny card that you don't need, you can use it to upgrade your Cavalier outfit for even more regen.

It has some interesting systems in play, such as your main skills are attached to your weapons. Since you can take 2 weapons into combat at any given time, it basically allows the player to take 2 sets of skills into combat, switching to maximize DPS and cool downs. Couple this with the ability to dodge we have an ARPG that's very much focused on the A part of ARPG.\n\nVictor Vran has a lot going for it. It has great visuals and audio, a stream lined build system where it still allows for a great degree of customization, and an action focused, and very enjoyable combat. But since the game is in early access, all of it's current flaws lay with this fact. There's no narrative or a proper campaign currently, a lot of models, items, and mobs are reused, and the progression of the game is excruciatingly dragged out. I attribute all of these flaws to it being in early access. I feel the biggest flaw is the slow progression. I have over 7 hours pumped into Victor Vran and barely leveled above level 10. It almost feels like the developers artificially inflated the amount of gold and xp needed to progress in order to hide the lack of content the game current suffers from. It just doesn't feel rewarding and I stopped out of boredom.\n\nSure I have my complaints but almost all of them are tied into it being in early access. The fantastic combat and how polished every thing feels is my best indication that Victor Vran isn't a lost cause. In fact I highly recommend people to keep an eye on this one. I'm hoping that once it's fully released it'll be something really special. As mentioned before, the game has a lot going for it. The Combat and character build systems in place already are very strong and very enjoyable. The presentation is eye catching and polished, it just needs to be done. There simply just needs to be a lot more of these things.\n\nOverall Victor Vran is an interesting ARPG that has a lot of promise, but in it's current state there simply just not enough of it. Keep an eye on this one.\n\nPros:\n- Polished Visuals and audio\n- Fun combat and character build design\n- Accessible and easy to get into\n\nCons:\n- Feels very incomplete\n- Drawn out progression\n- Lacks story or a proper campaign (currently)","April 23, 2015","true","7.9"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","4"

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","Victor Vran is something that could be considered a classic if it was tailored for both the devoted audience and casual players. It's a game I almost couldn't stand because of its deviations from what I expect to enjoy from an ARPG.\n\nOver four months ago I had first played Victor Vran for six hours before coming to the conclusion that the game wasn't for me or for casual ARPG players. Now, after 18 hours, I'm going to recommend this game—if you're willing to look beneath the surface.\n\nWhy the Change of Heart?\nI had a negative impression for numerous reasons.\n\nI was worn-out after 50 hours of Van Helsing: Final Cut. VV's streamlined gameplay didn't convince me there was any longevity/depth. The enemy variety was/is too limited and it became tiresome quickly. Worse of all,  I had thought the game had respawned enemies every time I left a general area for a mini-dungeon. (Not the HUB.)\n\nOnly by happenstance of me testing out the Steam Controller did I learn that almost all these issues could be fixed by looking further into the game. (Which is a problem for first-impressions or people not willing to experiment with the game.)\n\nI also learned my black mark—of respawning enemies and of erasing progress—was outright false. Something anyone who read this review, played the game and didn't agree with my thoughts should've pointed that out, not argued about the rating.\n\nThat misunderstanding is why I re-reviewed this game. Because even if I don't like a game I want to always be correct about my complaints.\n\nThe "Stagnant" Progression\nThere was a misunderstanding when I said progression feels stagnant. It's not that there is no depth or no way to improve yourself—the problem is that your character himself does not show gradual changes as you play, so everything feels the same.\n\nIt's better to say progression is abrupt, and entirely dependent on the player's involvement. Leveling up unlocks new things to experiment with (Destiny Card pts, card slots, a second weapon, item or demon power slot, etc.) They also unlock other additions like the transmutation system, another outfit, PvP, endless arena and Hexes (difficulty modifiers).\n\nThese are all options, options which you may or may not care about as you play. You're enjoyment of the game is based on how much interest you want to put into tweaking these options to create your own character, from the weapons/skills to your playstyle.\n\nZero Classes, All Tailored Adjustments\nIn order to appreciate the benefits of a "no-class" ARPG, you have to have some interest by experimenting with all these options. If that doesn't sound appealing than having a class-system laid out for you, then VV is not for you.\n\nThere are no "active" skill improvements other than finding a new demon power or a new type of weapon. But there are only eight weapons (and about the same number of demon powers): Swords, Hammers, Scythes, Rapiers, Shotguns, Lightning Guns, Mortar Guns, Tomes. Each weapon has three active skills (one standard attack, two specials), and you can have two weapon equipped and two demon powers at most. (10 total skills.)\n\nThe make-or-break deal is whether or not you like the weapon presets. On the one hand, each weapon is tailored for one playstyle and you can master it as you play. But if you don't like it, then that limits your options even further.\n\nThis could be fixed if the game offered new presets of skills. Instead, you have to find what weapon is for you—and if you combine weapon's abilities together (like the shotgun's speed boost with the hammer) you can get some interesting weapon synergy.\n\n(I still think the combat would flow much better if the devs took a page from Bloodborne used changing out weapons as another attack skill based on your weapon choices.)\n\nThe best part about this system is you can beat the game, entirely, without ranged weapons or one specific weapon type. Something that I had originally thought was mandatory, and yet I finished the game, solo, on Normal with two or three Hexes added.\n\n(Hexes, I have also found, made me ignore the Transmutation system entirely. I still got plenty of legendaries and good loot from random drops.)\n\nThe real source of improvement comes from building your character around the buffs of your Destiny Cards, your weapons/inventory and focusing on what weapons work best.\n\nThe Only Passive System that's Not All Boring\nIf you took a look at this list, you'd be forgiven thinking these things are unnecessary to pay attention to as you play: Destiny Cards[victorvran.wikia.com]\n\nThe reality is that is your source of builds in VV, and if you want to play the game properly you'll have to figure out what works with your playstyle (and weapons). The game's spike in difficulties at some points will force you to focus on this system.\n\nSome cards provide the basic whatever-percent value boost while others give flashier effects by taking damage or dealing out critical hits. Some will give you weapon modifiers. Some of which will help you stay alive by siphoning off health with each hit or kill.\n\nThere are also random effects (divine or wicked) that make lower-tiered buffs worth more than higher valued stuff. (A Divine Rogue 1 with armor penetration is much better than a Rogue 3 for some instances.) And because you have a limited number of Destiny Points, you have to take the time to figure out what selection is for you.\n\nCombine the Destiny Points with each outfits'/armors' adrenaline system to use Demon Powers, and you can find as much depth in this game as you would in most other ARPGs. The store-page was not lying when it said you need as much as skill as you need a proper build.\n\nThe question is, "Will you want to invest any interest in that system?"\n\nA Streamlined Game with Hardcore Demands\nAgain, you have to invest a lot in this non-casual-friendly system to play properly and to also understand its appeal. That is something that should be addressed as other similar games provide a simpler system, though they may be more or less complex than Victor Vran.\n\nThis isn't a cry for a game to become dumb-downed. I want more people to play this game, and I would bet that many who didn't enjoy it (based on my old review's ratings, 398 out of 503 upvotes) would come to love it if the system was developed more. (Either by more weapons, more preset options, more card variety tied to these changes, more enemy variety, etc.)\n\nIf you're not sure if the game is for you, then  I would urge you to try it for yourself on a sale, and if it is something you'd enjoy convince your friends to join up with you for cooperative play.\n\nSuggestions for ImprovementAdd another skill between weapons to make combat flow better. (Ex. Bloodborne.)\nIf we can't choose our skills for weapons, then let us have various presets for different playstyles. (It'll give us a reason to try weapons more.)\nMore interesting enemy variety.\nLess arbitrary "challenges" (no-hit, timers, etc.) and more Hex modifiers for challenge.","March 1","true","26.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Something we've seen before is the option to have two weapon sets (in this case just two weapons) equipped, and in Victor Vran due to the special move charge mechanics I find myself switching all the time. It's really fun, too! Nothing like jumping in the fray with the 2H Hammer leap slam, and then demolishing the rest with my sword or rapier.\n\nDue to the somewhat peculiar (for an ARPG) mechanics, I now find myself trying to take down packs of mobs unscathed. Dodging here and there, using leap slams etc.\n\nThe voice acting is quite entertaining, especially the guy mocking you as you go. I once lol'd when I went back to find a secret I missed, to which the commentator remarked how Victor decided to go the wrong way. :D I mean, that's just awesome. :D Then when I went where I should, he made of of me by saying how I finally decided to go the right way. That's just brilliant coding imho.\n\nI also enjoy the fact that very little in the character is locked, so you can switch out demon powers and destiny cards to change your play style. This is a nice casual change to having played Path of Exile recently.\nIn the beginning you choose class (actually an outfit) which determines what your character is like. Not sure if you can change it, I heard something about changing outfits later...\n\nThe map challenges are great as well, and some of them are actually quite hard.\nSecrets are a nice addition too, having to wall jump to special locations etc.\n\nThere isn't much on the loot side, but I haven't missed that so far. Usually I love farming items and perfecting my gear, but in the case of Victor Vran the gameplay itself is just so fun I don't really care for the lack of itemization.\n\nRegardless, can definitely recommend this game to ARPG fans! Easily, you will not regret it.","July 30, 2015","true","13.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It may not have some of the typical bells and whistles some of the other games have like skill trees or a perma-death mode, but the fast paced fluid combat really makes this game shine.\n\nPros:    The combat in this game really stands out from other games. I know some people have complained about there being only 3 skills per weapon but I find this lets you focus more on the combat itself then managing a larger number of skills and cooldowns. The ability to quickly swap between two weapons also helps keep the action fluid even in changing situations.\nThe artwork is wonderful. Maps are so finely crafted I seem to spend a great deal of time futilely attempting to enter non-playable parts just to explore.\nMap challenges and secrets provide a fun reason to more fully play each area and or return for future visits.\nThe Destiny Card system which is a passive skill system is interesting, requiring a different kind of balancing act then a more typical point based skill.\nCons:    The first thing that should be noted here is that there are still a number of bugs in the game. The majority of these for me at least are minor, not greatly affecting my play through. The developers also seem to have an active enough presence on the forums that I’m confident that these issues will be resolved.\nThere is no trading at the moment. I can understand the reasoning for not having this in the game as items do not have level requirements, but at the same time it can make things a little frustrating. For example I’ve mostly been playing coop with a friend and while I’ve gotten a lot of good weapon drops he’s been using the same weapon since almost the beginning as nothing better has dropped for him.\nThis is more of a personal pet peeve then a full con, but the chat system can be a little frustrating to operate when using keyboard+mouse to play. After sending a message the game keeps you in the chatbox until you either hit Enter, Esc, or click outside the box. It can make communication a little difficult when in the middle of combat.\nAll in all, I’ve been very happy with Victor Vran and would definitely recommend it as a great ARPG that puts a different spin on some of the core concepts of the sub-genre.","July 28, 2015","true","10.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I am a huge fan of TiaoVH trilogy which it is hard not to compare this game against but I think the game holds it's own rather nicely.  I do not believe it is a clone like some have said.  It has a similar feel yes, but plenty to set itself apart.  I haven't ran into any major bugs or problems yet.   I like the WASD control scheme with it.  All in all it is a very nice ARPG game.   Is it ground breaking?  No but is it a must have for a ARPG fan, I would say yes, even in it's pre-release state.   Due to being sick I haven't been able to play it as much as I would have liked and only in real short spurts of time but it has been well worth the time I did play.   I give it a thumb up for sure.\n\nPost Launch Update 7/25:\nI have added a bit more time under my belt on this one and I have to say that I am digging it more and more now that it has launched.  I have actually switched to playing it with an XBOX 360 controller over WASD/Mouse controls and found it to play very nicely that way as well.  Honestly it plays like Dungeon Seige 3 wanted to play, IE an diablo-like, action RPG with smooth controller mapped options.  I like it because it is straight forward and while it has a lot of depth it doesn't seem to be cluttered with a bunch of useless stats and stuff that cause me want to bang my head.  So with a couple more hours now under my belt I have to say that this game is quickly rising in my ranks of MUST play.  Really enjoying it.  The story so far hasn't been anything amazing, and the graphics are so/so, but the game play is very fun.  Word of warning though and if you don't already know this Victor Vran is voiced by the same voice actor that does Geralt from The Witcher, so that is one of those things that once you have heard it is hard to unhear since Geralt is such an iconic character.  Outside of that I am LOVING the game.\n\nUpdate #2 on 7/25 - This is my new favorite game.","June 26, 2015","true","10.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","5"

It also has a dodge system which makes combat quick, addictive, and enjoyable.\nThe way you play the game is very immersive, there are no skill trees and stat selections upon leveling up, instead you're given bonuses and upgrades, you get to select one of 3.\nThere are no classes, your playstyle is based on your outfit (which determines the way you gain overdrive, which is used to activate demon powers), your cards (which grant specific buffs and abilities, you can select multiple), and your demon powers (powerful skills aquired from killing enemies with demonic powers, you can equip two of these.)\nNow, one thing to point out, all the items in the game can be upgraded. Everything can be transmuted and made stronger. Weapons can have power stones, which add stat buffs. Outfits can be upgraded to gain traits from legendary cards. Cards have regular versions, and the more powerful wicked and divine versions which have useful passives and buffs.\n\nThe game also has plenty of MMO like challenges minus the trivial part of actually acquiring the quest and going back to the person for your reward. There is also multiplayer, a PvE arena, basic fighting pit PvP, and probably more things that I still havent found.\n\nThis game has been very active and the devs seem to be putting all of their effort into this game. Overall its a beautiful game, I have had no bugs or errors, the game runs perfectly. More content is added weekly.\n\nTo sum it up; if you like aRPGs but you're looking for something different, refreshing, enjoyable, and challenging, just buy this game and stop looking.

Has a great combat system, good customization, and very nice online play. Italso has impressive camera work, making seeing where you need to see possible in all areas of the game.\n\nThe combat system is very action-filled and allows for a variety of combos. Speaking of variety there are quite a few different types of weapons of which you can equip two of them (after reaching an early level) and can freely switch between them at any time. Each weapon comes with it's basic attack and two skills. It may not seem like much at first, but then you realize that you can combo different weapon skills together and the possibilities are pretty much endless. There are a few different classes of enemies with their own subclasses, each with varying levels of style. There could b more IMO, but what is currently in the game is more than sufficient.\n\nI really like the customization in this game. It allows a person to "build a class" so to speak. While it's possible to stick to the usual , it's also possible to go and make something whacky. There are 2 slots for weapons, 2 for potions, 1 for your suit(armor), 2 for overdrive(super) skills, and up to 5(one suit gives a 6th) Destiny card slots. The suit serves as a foundation for your build, as it not only influences tankiness, but how you gain overdrive. The Destiny cards serve to tweak the foundation. The potions and powers augment your style while the weapons help determine your offense. It's very well done and offers many combinations.\n\nHave you ever had that moment where you can't see something but if the camera were 5 degrees to the left you would be able to see it? Well fear not, those days are over in this game. The camera can *gasp* BE ROTATED. This feature wil spoil you. You may even spin it around for no reason. Don't worry, these are just symptoms Acute Visual Rotary Obsession Disorder. They may (or may not) wear off over time. With that said, Objects will smoothly vanish so you can see behind them as you travel behind them according to your perception if you forget to rotate the camera. It doesn't look weird and is very well done.\n\nThere is many more things good about this game, but these hit me the most. There are still a few minor bugs but the get squashed quickly with the hammer of debugging (I wish this were an actual weapon lol)\n\noverall 10/10, did not get 11/10 cause no hammer of debugging weapon.","July 18, 2015","true","118.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"

Although there isn't voice acting at the moment, it would definitely help if there will be, adding to the overall great production of a game.\n\nThe gameplay is great with a lot of weapons to play around with, different armor/clothes types to wear, a lot of variety and fun in its different mechanics like simply jumping, which most if not all games in its genre does not use, wall-jumping which is extremely satisfying (as well as normal jumping) to access new areas, and finding secret nicely hidden areas which is awesome to find and rewarding.\n\nAlso, when going into a dungeon, or any level, you would have a nice little preview of that dungeon/level before going in. The game is moderately challenging, with boss fights being unique and extremely challenging, even with a coop friend. Mentioning coop, it's really nice with no complications to come along with it, as you just invite and your friend is in your world to slay monsters with you.\n\nWhat I want from the game is voice acting as I mentioned above, and the ability to tilt the camera up and down as it sometimes feel weird not being able to do so. Another thing that's more to spice and mix things up a bit, is having a different character other than the main one, or at least having the opposite gender, not that important but would definitely add more value to its variety and somewhat to its overall enjoyment factor.\n\nI was reluctant of trying this game out, but after my friend pushed me to give it a go, I was extremely surprised of how good it is and how it's adding features to its gameplay that no other in its genre is doing, and those features are blowing my satisfaction of the game and its genre sky high, more so than the top dog which at the moment which is Diablo 3. Definitely give this game a look as it deserves your attention, as it did mine.\n\nShameless link[ksalue.com] to original post.","April 8, 2015","true","3.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

Just take what made Diablo great and expand on it.  Simple right?  If you know anything about these games, you know more times than not, it's either Hit or Miss...Hit meaning classics like Titan Quest, Torchlight, and Grim Dawn...or Miss meaning pieces of trash like Blood Knights, Sacred 3, or The Incredibly Impossible Adventures of Van Helsing.\n\nAnyway, Victor Vran takes the ARPG formula and makes it real simple and functional.  Firstly, you get to choose your controls - WSAD to move & click to attack, Click to Move/Attack, or gamepad.  You read that correctly...all three are options, as well as key mapping for either keyboard option you choose.  Why other dungeon crawlers don't attempt to adopt this kind of setup is beyond me.\n\nThat said, there's a reason more people enjoy playing Diablo III on a console..using a controller feels so excellent for this type of game, and it's actually very responsive.  Your attacks are quick, but weighty, and you actually get experience points for doing more damage to an enemy than needed.\n\nThey've added a jump button, which at first seems stupid, but combined with the ability to wall jump, it actually allows you to get to secret areas and get away from enemies.  They've also included a dodge button, taking a page out of the Dungeon Siege III book.  There's no cooldown or stamina bar for dodge rolls like there is in Risk of Rain or Dark Souls, respectively. You can do it as many times as you want and it really comes in handy.\n\nSound is great, voice acting is pretty spot on as well.  From time to time it DOES sound like the voice actor is reading his lines..because he is...but it's still well done.  Looting is par for the course, and you'll be able to upgrade your weapons, transmute, etc.  Since there's no skill tree or even any classes so-to-speak,  your skills and based on your outfit and the weapons you use.  It sounds strange, but it really does work.  That ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ skill tree in PoE turned a lot of people off, myself included, so to have things simplified so I can concentrate on killing stuff is a breath of fresh air.\n\nEach dungeon actually gives you 5 tasks to complete, each one giving you a star for completion.  Some of them require you to take no damage, use no potions, or slay a certain number of beasts in a certain amount of time.  If things get hectic and you can only accomplish 4 out of the five, no biggie.  Just leave, get your mind right, go back later and get that 5th star.  It's pretty linear gameplay, but if you're a fan of this genre, then you've come to expect that.\n\nSo far the game's a lot of fun, and it's only gonna get better.  Grab it now while it's in Early Access or wait til the 26th when it gets a full release.  Either way, it's worth owning.  Hands down one of the best ARPGs I've ever played.","July 8, 2015","true","9.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

I picked it up during the Exploration sale, and I’m so glad I did. This game takes an old school type of game and turns up the coolness to 11. If you’re a stats person, this game has stats on everything. Plus you get to transmute everything in the game which, changes, improves, or makes new weapons, cards (I’ll get to that in a moment) runes, and more.\nThis game when it comes to weapons reminds me of Borderlands, with tons of different weapons, and stats to blow your mind. But this game has way more than weapons to think about, it uses cards that have special powers, that you can equip to increase so many different things I couldn’t begin to list them all . It’s also a huge game, with secrets to find in every level. There is so much to do, it always feels fresh. The combat is amazing. You have many weapon types to use, as well as tomes, which have special powers, plus each weapon type has a main and two special powers. But that’s not all. You also can equip Two Demon Powers, which can be powered up by fighting. And like the weapons, you have a huge choice of powers to choose from. All are awesome, and look really cool when used.\nAs for controller support, it works great with a 360 controller. I like using a controller on this game because you have to be able to switch weapons and powers in a blink, and this is all a button away.\nDon’t let this game slip away. If playing games where time flies and you I don’t want to stop playing because you want to see what cool thing is next then this is the game for you.\n","December 8, 2015","true","61.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Its really fun. It has all the typical things you'd expect from a mouse driven isometric RPG. Randomized loot, hordes of enemies, challenges, NPCs. Only instead of just clicking for all you're worth and triggering hotkeys, you run around using different attacks including specials, dodging, jumping and switching weapon types on the fly.\nI'm having a blast with the destructable environments. Most of the "random props" (ex boxes, market stalls, statues) that you find scattered around levels in a game like this are fully destructable in Victor Vran. Sometimes you even find gold or loot, but its just fun to run around smashing stuff. Only downside so far is the non-mappable controller, about which I go into greater detail below.\n\nThe story revolves around Victor Vran, a demon hunter. He of course, has the suitable gravelly voice one would expect from a swashbuckling demon hunter named Victor Vran. He totally reminds me of Vampire Hunter D, up to and including the fact that he has some "demonic powers" and a giant hat. The technology of the game seems kind of steampunk-magic, with muskets alongside Tesla-esque lightning shooters, swords and demonic powers. The game starts with a brief story. Victor is looking fore his friend in a city that has fallen to demons. After a brief tutorial level you will find the NPC safe hub. Here you will learn further details of your mission, trade, and look at the map to decide which area to journey to. Speaking with an NPC results in a large static picture of the NPC, and a full voiceover of text on the screen.\n\nThe DLC I got gives me a "bounty". By beating uniques, you complete the bounty. My first bounty (unsure if theres more) unlocks a new Outfit, which is a full reskin of Victor that actually changes the conditions that cause your demonic power meter to charge. You start with 3 outfits. A balanced, magic-focused, and precision. Each caters to a different style of play.\n\nEach combat area has different "challenges" (basically achievements) and secrets within it. At first you can only go to the Royal Gardens, but you unlock different areas as you progress.\n\nMy one BIG complaint so far is that the controller layout is unmappable. I have a disability. LB/LT are hard for me to use quickly while also moving with LS. I play PC instead of console due to the fact that customizable input is normal, and for those games that require realtime M+K, theres the (admittedly imperfect) solution of JoytoKey or Xpadder. To me, a non -mappable controller on a game boasting "full controller support" damages what could have been an across the board awesome game. Its probably minor to most of you so I'm not going to allow it to affect my recommendation, but any gamer who has physical issues should take this into account. Devs, please make your controller input fully mapable on a PC game!\n\nOther than that, so far the game is very very fun. It reminds me of the awesome fun of Torchlight/Torchlight 2 (games which IMHO are way better than the Diablo series), but a full ARPG instead of just a mouseclicker RPG.\n\nI will continue adding to this review as I progress in game. I have plans for sections about sidequests, loot, the various level designs and so on.","November 26, 2015","true","6.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","4"

There's also some new ideas making game more skillfull than your average other aRPG, but the story was very weak and very badly presented and some complex loot system and some stat system would help the game a lot.\n\nOn the upside - there is crazy amount of additional optional stuff. Only like 1/4th of the locations are mandatory for story (plus each location comes with set of challenges and secrets) so there's a lot to do besides story itself. But with very basic loot system there is no real motivation to do so, from like 1/3 of the game I basically ignored most of the optional locations because there was no reason to do them or to max challenges.\n\nIf you're not intrested in story or loot hoarding, only in combat elements of aRPGs - it will offer you a lot of content. But if you like core aRPGs, collecting equipment, maximizing your hero, trying different builds etc - it's fine, but not the best.","March 1","true","13.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","0"

I thought: "I've played that game six times already, Bethesda." I've been gaming for more than 30 years and needed something fresh if I was to stay a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sexual tyrannosaurus! A friend recommended "Victor Vran". He said it was "kinda like a mix between Diablo and League of Legends but totally different than both" and, well, that sums it up pretty well.\n\n"Victor Vran" is an ARPG that is light on classes / skills and heavy on action, weapons and movement. I like it a lot. You're a demon hunter whacking and shooting baddies and monstrosities for loot and while you do level up, you do not get to choose new skills or level up your stats. You get a choice of items, cards (which give you special buffs) or outfits instead. So, if you're the kind of guy / girl who enjoys finetuning their ARPG build more than anything else, this might not be a game for you. I recommend you try out "Grim Dawn" instead, which in my humble opinion is the very best game of this kind.\n\nIn "Victor Vran", you need to move. A lot. You have to dodge enemy attacks and time your own properly. This lends a mildly arcade-y flavour to the action and I enjoyed it a lot. The coolest thing about "Victor Vran" are the weapons, though. There are quite a few and they all handle differently. Each class of weapon possesses 2 secondary attacks (which you activate by pressing Q or E) and these are the part of the game that remind of MOBA games, cooldown, skillshot-lines and all. They usually either stack with each other or are somehow intertwined and this makes playing each class of weapon like playing a totally different class of character. The slow, pounding Warhammer and its aerial attacks are incredibly satisfying until you have to fight fast, darting enemies who are best tagged with the lightning gun's primary attack and then destroyed with heat-seeking ball lightnings. That kind of thing. BIG FUN, RIGHT?\n\nStory- and graphics-wise, "Victor Vran" is generic, somewhat bland (although colourful) but enjoyable nonetheless. At least there are some genuinely funny punchlines.\n","November 14, 2015","true","5.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

Although one thing should be clear about this game is the fact there is no typical skill progression where you spend points on skills, the skills you have are based on the weapon you equip. Thats not to say you cant make your own build as there is other types of skills you can Loot/Equip called Powers which all have there own Rarity, Along with Weapons > Prefix > Suffix.\n\nAs you start your adventure on this game nothing to begin with really stands out, other than the wasd action movement and being able to jump over objects or down/up terrain (which is really satisfying on an isometric) along with dodge.\nThis game seems like nothing out of the ordinary and then some time down the line you start to realize the game has ideas, mechanics, and similar music from other arpg/isometric games all put into one game, minus skill progression.\n\nThe music in Victor Vran is good, it reminds me of some music in older games that I played in the past years.\nTransmution is incredibly addictive, along with trying to gamble with transmution, you can transmute many items including your powers.\nMonster zone venders in games are nice but one thing VV does different is when you find the vender, you need to fight him untill he submits....Nice Touch.\n\nThis game is Beast there is no doubt about it hopefully other arpg game devs take notes these guys clearly did.\n\nI really did struggle to find something wrong with this game, but if I was to be picky there is no jewelry, the videos before a boss or quest dialogues are capped on 30fps and the melee aiming could be a bit better but in general movement is good you can even wall kick =).\nVan Helsing is one of the only isometrics that I didnt enjoy, but this game seems to have filled an empty void.\n\nGood game, lots of items, magic find, many bosses, transmution, multiple potions, endless dungeon, pvp arena, bank stash, creative world map and each map has its own challanges along with being able to add map Prefix and Suffix.\n\nIm glad I bought this game, Its not a game I would suggest to wait for it to go on sale, its worth every penny.","July 9, 2015","true","27.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

You actively dodge and jump around to avoid damage.  Basically the movements and attacks is like an MMO, but in a top-down view like traditional ARPG's.\n\nThe character customization isn't super deep like other ARPG's, there are no specific classes.  The customization comes in weapons, destiny cards, and demon powers.  There are different weapons that you can use and each weapon has their own special skills to use.  There are no rings or accessorie slots, but there are items called "destiny cards" which are similar to those.  These cards give passive bonus' to your character, asyou level up you can equip more and powerful cards.  Also demon powers are special spells that you can equip to use against the enemy and there is a variety of them that you can use for different situations.\nWith all of this said, each of these items have different rarity tiers and also you can upgrade the stats on these items as well.  So all in all, customization is not that deep, but there is enough depth to keep you occupied in obtaining the best stats in the game.\n\nFinal thoughts:  I have been searching for a game that will give me that "new game" feeling I had as a kid.  It has been a long and expensive search as you can tell from my library, but I think I have found it with Victor Vran.  Every time I open the game I get excited, planning what I want to do that day, be it slaying monsters for fun, finding legendary weapons, or just crafting.  Usually these days I can only play games for about 1 hour before I get bored, but with this game I can go on for hours and that is rare for a game nowadays to do.\n\nSo if you're looking for an epic combat system and have fun for hours on end, get this game, you will NOT regret it.

Even though I prefer a challenge in games that I play, the hardcore mode in the game didn’t feel hard until the last ten percent of the game, and instead felt annoying. This is because it took forever to kill enemies, especially when you first start playing, mainly because of the hexes you have while playing hardcore. To remedy this, I built my character as a glass cannon meaning that I ignored defense items and purely went for offense, so that it wouldn’t take forever to kill anything. Even though I had no defense, I almost never died except for when there were huge groups of enemies and sometimes on bosses. In other words, hardcore mode is mostly annoying instead of hard, and normal difficulty is probably too easy.

I loved their Tropico series of games, but the action RPG genre isn't something you just dive into when all you're known for are sim games. I'm a huge fan of the Diablo series, I've played quite a bit of Marvel Heroes and Path of Exile as well as both Torchlight games. Victor Vran is like a breath of fresh air in the genre, and it's not just because you can jump and roll around - the game does a good job making all drops feel valuable, something that very few action RPGs succeed in doing. The story and voice acting is average, but the combat is really solid, the idea of switching weapons and having no classes is pretty unique and well done.\n\nIn Victor Vran you can switch between two weapons at any time, giving you access to a total of four weapon skills (plus regular attacks for each weapon). You can then equip two different Demon Powers, which are essentially spells, giving you access to six skills total. Then there's two slots for consumables and trinkets, like potions or a lucky rabbit's foot that gives you 100% critical hit chance for five seconds. To further customize your character, you gain access to Destiny Cards and that's when Victor Vran gets really awesome, because you can switch how your character players pretty easily. If you want to be able to live longer, you can put on a bunch of life steal and armor Destiny Cards to make your character tanky. Or if you like playing ranged, you do use the Archer card for increased range damage and stack critical hit chance and critical hit damage. Be able to switch up how your character is at anytime is pretty rad, especially when you can upgrade nearly everything in the game through the transmutation system.\n\nI wrote a longer and more detailed review here: http://www.fullcleared.com/2015/07/18/victor-vran-review-haunted-past/ but really, if you're a fan of action RPGs, you should definitely check out Victor Vran. The end game is pretty solid right now, and Haemimont has been adding a ton of content, so I expect it to get much better in the coming months.","July 19, 2015","true","17.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Although one thing should be clear about this game is the fact there is no typical skill progression where you spend points on skills, the skills you have are based on the weapon you equip. Thats not to say you cant make your own build as there is other types of skills you can Loot/Equip called Powers which all have there own Rarity, Along with Weapons > Prefix > Suffix.\n\nAs you start your adventure on this game nothing to begin with really stands out, other than the wasd action movement and being able to jump over objects or down/up terrain (which is really satisfying on an isometric) along with dodge.\nThis game seems like nothing out of the ordinary and then some time down the line you start to realize the game has ideas, mechanics, and similar music from other arpg/isometric games all put into one game, minus skill progression.\n\nThe music in Victor Vran is good, it reminds me of some music in older games that I played in the past years.\nTransmution is incredibly addictive, along with trying to gamble with transmution, you can transmute many items including your powers.\nMonster zone venders in games are nice but one thing VV does different is when you find the vender, you need to fight him untill he submits....Nice Touch.\n\nThis game is Beast there is no doubt about it hopefully other arpg game devs take notes these guys clearly did.\n\nI really did struggle to find something wrong with this game, but if I was to be picky there is no jewelry, the videos before a boss or quest dialogues are capped on 30fps and the melee aiming could be a bit better but in general movement is good you can even wall kick =).\nVan Helsing is one of the only isometrics that I didnt enjoy, but this game seems to have filled an empty void.\n\nGood game, lots of items, magic find, many bosses, transmution, multiple potions, endless dungeon, pvp arena, bank stash, creative world map and each map has its own challanges along with being able to add map Prefix and Suffix.\n\nIm glad I bought this game, Its not a game I would suggest to wait for it to go on sale, its worth every penny.","July 9, 2015","true","27.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

You actively dodge and jump around to avoid damage.  Basically the movements and attacks is like an MMO, but in a top-down view like traditional ARPG's.\n\nThe character customization isn't super deep like other ARPG's, there are no specific classes.  The customization comes in weapons, destiny cards, and demon powers.  There are different weapons that you can use and each weapon has their own special skills to use.  There are no rings or accessorie slots, but there are items called "destiny cards" which are similar to those.  These cards give passive bonus' to your character, asyou level up you can equip more and powerful cards.  Also demon powers are special spells that you can equip to use against the enemy and there is a variety of them that you can use for different situations.\nWith all of this said, each of these items have different rarity tiers and also you can upgrade the stats on these items as well.  So all in all, customization is not that deep, but there is enough depth to keep you occupied in obtaining the best stats in the game.\n\nFinal thoughts:  I have been searching for a game that will give me that "new game" feeling I had as a kid.  It has been a long and expensive search as you can tell from my library, but I think I have found it with Victor Vran.  Every time I open the game I get excited, planning what I want to do that day, be it slaying monsters for fun, finding legendary weapons, or just crafting.  Usually these days I can only play games for about 1 hour before I get bored, but with this game I can go on for hours and that is rare for a game nowadays to do.\n\nSo if you're looking for an epic combat system and have fun for hours on end, get this game, you will NOT regret it.  Trust me :)","July 9, 2015","true","34.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Your abilities are determined by what weapon you equip, destiny cards (i.e. passive skills) and what demon abilities you equip (think super moves from fighting games).\n\nThe game works well in melding these layers of customisation so that you can create some interesting builds.\n\nThe ingame stash is shared between all your saves... and it even grows a new tab when you need it!\n\nControls via mouse + keyboard, and the controller feels great but I find the controller to just feel more natural.\n\nWith 4 player co-op included, Victor Vran ticks all the right boxes for what needs to be included in an ARPG. IMHO, this is simply the best ARPG you can get on Steam at time of writing.","April 9","true","19.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

For the asking price though it’s great value for money and if you’re into Gothic games of this nature then it comes highly recommended despite being a little simplistic overall. Aside from a lack of local multiplayer, a camera that’s perhaps too far away at times and no other characters to choose from there’s little else to complain about here making Victor Vran well worth checking out.\n\nScore 8.5/10https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_FN0aGp6jE","July 28, 2015","true","29.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Haemimont Games are best known for their work on the Tropico series however they have also developed games such as: Celtic Kings, Imperium Romanum/ Grand Ages: Rome, the Tzar series and Omerta – City of Gangsters as well as a few others. Haemimont Games have as this list suggests primarily focused on RTS and city building games, it’s nice to see a developer try something new, but not without its risks, does the risk pay off? Read on to find out.\n\nYou are a demon hunter with a secret, you made a pact some years ago in order to wield Demon powers. A message arrives from your friend Adrian in the land of Zagoravia, a land that succumbed to a Demon invasion one year earlier, telling you he’s found the thing that you seek (what this is, is yet to be discovered).\n\nYou do not know much about the land of Zagoravia only that many Demon Hunters travelled to the land only to never return including your friend Adrian. The travel to Zagoravia in order to find out what happened to your friend and also in the hopes of finding this secret that your friend discovered. Perhaps you may find out what exactly happened in the mystery of the Demon incursion into Zagoravia. Upon arrival you start hearing a character calling himself “the voice” that resides apparently in your head.\n\nVictor Vran is an action-RPG that focuses on customisation as opposed to classes as there are no specific classes to speak of, essentially you can customise your character to play in a class of your own design. You can choose to wield up to two weapons consisting of mortars, swords, scythes, lightning guns hammers and rapiers (there may be perhaps others I have yet to discover) you also have a choice of outfits and can even customise its colour if you so desire. Additionally you have a choice of multiple Demon powers and can wield up to two of them there is also a choice of what is called “destiny cards” which you collect and they provide you with various buffs. Each of these items have various levels and/or rarity.\n\nThere is also a variety of consumables that can be used from the basic health potion to the more advanced leech bomb. Upon reaching level 16 you have access to the “transmutation” facility which allows you to combine all of your pickups except potions into either a generally improved item, an item of higher rarity or if you so choose a random item.\n\nIn Victor Vran you are extremely mobile and have the ability to jump or dodge to avoid incoming damage. You can also wall jump in order to reach otherwise inaccessible areas, and can also use the mortars special jump ability to reach even more inaccessible areas. Each of the levels have various different optional challenges that you can attempt completion of, which will provide a reward of some description from money, XP to a reward chest that can contain a random item of the same level as the chest.\n\nIn addition to the normal and hard modes players can also add further levels of difficulty with the addition of “hexes” which add certain buffs to the enemies granting a further challenge and higher reward. Players can also join in multiplayer with up to 3 other people for Co-op action or even venture into the PVP arena to find out who is the better hunter.\n\nMechanically speaking the additional mobility of the character provides an extra layer of skill which helps with the overall immersion of the game. The loot, items and challenges/rewards system all work really well together. The only issue I found was a slight graphical glitch which occurred under certain circumstances I have however alerted the developer to this.\n\nHowever this is very minor and is to be expected of an early access title. Graphically speaking the game has a dark Gothic theme which suits the era and overall aesthetic. As for sound the soundtrack is suitably Gothic and dark, the music and sound assets all work well, the combination of which adds to the overall immersion of the game.\n\nOverall I found this game to be an absolute joy to play, it of course has similarities with Diablo 3 however I found that I lost interest with Diablo whereas with Victor Vran I thoroughly enjoyed it and find myself itching to play some more. This can be attributed to the customisation of the character, the hilarious movie quotes (Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Star Wars to name but two) and other equally hilarious abuse received from “The Voice (inside your head)” or perhaps it’s the hilarity that ensued from meeting the “Gangnam Style” dancing skeletons. Sufficive to say this new direction for Haemimont Games paid off with dividends, and I for one can’t wait to see both what additions they make to the game and of course the next game they work on.\n\n10/10","July 21, 2015","true","13.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The transmutation system did a surprisingly good job of making the itemization feel deeper and more established as well.\n\nHaving Doug Cockle (Geralt of The Witcher) voice the main protagonist was certainly a point in the game's favor.  I honestly never expected such talent to lend their voice to the cast.  Rather than limiting the voiceover work to cutscenes and active dialogue alone, as I had thought they would, Victor Vran and other characters routinely spout out lines during gameplay.  This has the effect of making the general hum-drum of monster bashing a little bit more interesting and even humorous in at least one case.\n\nI have to admit that when I restarted the game with the sole purpose of re-evaluating my review, I never expected to change my recommendation.  I started with a new save slot and played to where I had left off before my last review.\n\nThe game as a whole seems to gel better than it had previously.  The voiceover work did a surprisingly good job of making the experience more engaging.  The combat is still excellent.  Don't get me wrong here, the combat is far, far from deep and intricate, but it's fast paced and feels impactful.  I like it.\n\nI only experienced one bug which forced me to turn off reverb in my sound options.  With the option turned on character voices were accompanied by an incredibly annoying scratchy hum.  Other than that, I played with every option on ultra and had an enjoyable, smooth experience.  I also have to mention that I play on an ultra-widescreen monitor and had no stretching or UI issues at 21:9 aspect ratio.  Definitely a plus in my book.\n\nI now feel that despite it's flaws this game is worth the cost of entry.  It has become the game the devs meant for it to be.","June 1, 2015","true","8.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","34"

The game has the kind of generous polish you'd expect from a higher budget project.\n\nThis game shines in its combat interactions. It is very addictive and can be enjoyed for countless hours. The precision is superb and the creatures' AI can be quite challenging. The only issue with it, is that there isn't enough. Unfortunately the game itself on normal mode will feel easy to any experience gamer. Start a game on Hard and you'll encounter some of the problems with Victor Vran. The balancing of the game is basically an exercise in changing numbers. Creatures have more armor, hit for more and may be faster. You can tweak these characteristics by enabling handicaps called Hexes, but in the end the fights do not change much. Once you've mastered all creatures, then the game becomes an exercise in finding better equipment and it basically becomes a grind.\n\nVictor Vran's equipment scheme is a basic one compared to other RPG types. Most of the equipment that is found (weapons) is useless and can either be sold or transmuted. This is my second critique of the game in that it doesn't really establish any links with the character you are building. It's basically like a Chinese buffet. You can do everything you want as long as you're grinding for it. Demon Powers and Destiny Cards as more equipment are supposed to replace a skill tree, but the level of interest isn't great due the limited options or the limited benefits they bring.\n\nMy third and final critique is that the story isn't very enticing. It's very basic and unfortunately it doesn't really immerses the player effectively. The game exposes too many challenges while the story is unraveling and it's really easy to get side tracked just trying to get better equipment to answer those challenges.\n\nWith these 3 point in mind, this game still rocks. I'm actively wishing for a sequel where these issues are answered.","May 17","true","224.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

There are a few different weapon archetypes (around 8) that all share movesets with one another - so if you find a sword, it will have the same moves as another sword you find, a rapier will have the same as a rapier, etc.  You can have 2 held weapons at once and most of the skills have a cooldown so you will dance between both weapons triggering cooldowns while dodging enemy attacks and unleashing demonic super moves.\n\nYou can equip yourself with:\nCards -Apply a passive bonus to you stats or cause things like explosions when you overkill an enemy\nDemonic Ability - Active skills used after charging a meter, can do things from rain damage, shield, slow time and others.\nWeapons - The various weapons all have different moves that feel very different when switching between styles.\nArmor - The armor you choose can change heavily the focus of how you play causing you to either gain demon powers faster, give you more armor and others.\n\nEverything that you can equip can also be modified via the transmuation (crafting) system allowing you to upgrade most things you find.\n\nThe game also boasts a challenge system that unlocks fairly early on (level 13) that you can turn on various bonuses for the enemies to increase the experience and drops you get from them but also increase the difficulty for you.\n\nEach of the areas within the game has set challenges tied to it as well allowing you to try and do various challenges every stage for rewards - they may be things like kill this boss without using a potion, find 3 secret chests, kill so many enemies with a hammer and so on - these make the trek the each area all the more interesting and provide you with gold, experience and items should you choose to pursue them.\n\nThe game also has online capabilities but I have not played that so I can't weigh in on that particular aspect of the game.\n\nAnyone who likes action games, diablo clones or RPG's should really probably give this game a look - and it even has a indie game price to make it all the more inticing (<20$ at launch)","July 26, 2015","true","20.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Attacking and using special attacks or spells is the same as in other games. The loot in this game is pretty limited with only a few different types of weapons and only a handful of armors to select. Leveling up is not as exciting as in other games as you merely only get health or destiny points, where destiny points allows you to equip different cards which all have different perks (this is where the majority of the character customization comes from). The game is ~20 hours long if you want to see all the areas and play the story in detail while finding all the secret chests scattered around each area. The game adds challenges for every area, which start out pretty fun but near the end of the game the challenges get ridiculous and can be frustrating. Once you beat all the regular challenges there are elite challenges that get unlocked which are even more insane. The game has a bottomless pit and an area that has a randomized dungeon to increase the longevity of the game, however the end game is shallow compared to other ARPG games. Overall, the game is a lot of fun, very well done and If you're looking for an ARPG game this is a must play.","April 15","true","23.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Engaging combat and skill based gameplay are this title's cornerstone features in a crowded market. Utilise powerful aimed abilities, demonic magic and timed attacks as you jump, dodge and smash your way to victory.\nJoin Victor as he journeys deep into this monster infested kingdom in search of his lost friend and fellow hunter, Adrian. Along the way, encountering beautifully drawn and well voiced characters who help us uncover the truth about Zagoravia and the hideous beasts that plague it.\n\nVictor Vran represents a departure from current trends in the genre, trading loot grinding for subtle, mechanic shifting gear choices that shape the way the player approaches the games many challenges. While it borrows much from esteemed contemporaries, such as Diablo, Torchlight and Path of Exile, Haemimont Games have managed to create their own unique take on the modern Action-RPG while also managing to invoke some of the spirit found in hack and slash classics like Blood Omen.\n\nThe graphics and art in the game are a real high point, perhaps eschewing the expense of fidelity for a dark and sombre, with a hint of the fantastic, style that is carried consistently throughout out the gameplay and story segments alike. The music is moody and subdued, matching the setting perfectly and complimenting the action with aplomb.\n\nI highly recommend it and you can check out my Let's Play if you want to see the game in action:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=493416711","August 3, 2015","true","6.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pixyunicorz/recommended/345180/","Pixyunicorz","Tricky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pixyunicorz/","46 products in account","This review is for the final game. I've completed the first Act and have aquired the "hex" system for increasing difficulty (explained below).\n\nAs a long time fan of the action RPG (ARPG) I'm always on the lookout for new entries in the genre that Diablo made famous. With some glaring exceptions, the ARPG over the last few years has not disappointed with games like Torchlight 2, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, and Diablo III (post auction house). I'm happy to report that Victor Vran is another excellent example of ARPG done right.\n\nGraphics: Let's start off with the least important (and least impressive) thing in this game. ARPGs rely on visual indicators to tell you what kind of attacks you are being subjected to and they can't clutter the screen with tons of words and icons like a MMO or traditional RPG. Victor Vran's art style is clean and fits the dark tone of the game, it's not visually amazing even with everything cranked to the max, but the information the game and its user interface delivers to the player is streamlined and I never had trouble figuring out what I was looking at or what exactly an attack was.\n\nSound: Fittingly spooky music, good voice acting (the main character sounds remarkably like Geralt of Rivia), and some really "meta" lines from the narrator (which you will either love or despise, believe me). The weapon attacks sound great from the boom of the shotgun to the weighty thumps of the hammer.\n\nGameplay: Ok, let's get down to what really counts here. What makes this game worth playing amongst its peers? The action it puts back in ARPG. Victor can run and jump, roll deftly, and leap down from ledges to explore lower areas. The gameplay feels great and the controller interface is nice and smooth without taking away from mouse-driven staples like clicking away frantically at monsters. The skills are weapon based, but the game really encourages you to switch weapons often and doesn't use a skill tree so you're always going to be very efficient with every skill in the game (more or less depending on your other gear synergy, of course). Fans of the genre may lament the lack of a sprawling skill tree with tons of customization options, but this game places skill above build and you will need to actually learn how each skill interacts to clear all the "kill monsters with x weapon" challenges.\n\nVictor can also equip potions and bombs (on cooldowns, no spamming) as well as two magic spells called Demonic Powers. These powers range from beneficial auras to meteors that fall from the sky. The destiny cards you find or get at level-up grant your passives and can be swapped on the fly to mess with your build. There are also outfits that change how your demon power is restored (amongst other bonuses) so there is plenty to tinker with even without the skill tree.\n\nThe most interesting thing for me about the gameplay was the challenge system. Each map has a few challenges to complete that really direct your gameplay. The effect of these challenges cannot be understated because their presence keeps the game from feeling repetitive. On one map you may be trying not to take a single hit and on the next you may need to use a weapon that you haven't mastered yet. Past level 12 you pick up "hexes" which are similar to Bastion's gods or Transistor's limiters in that they reward you with greater prizes for suffering buffs to your foes and debuffs to you. The rewards are so amazing that I was tempted to leave them on, and they even have a leveling mechanic of their own to intice completionists.\n\nVictor Vran is a lot of fun. I don't know how long the game will remain fresh without different classes and skill trees, but for the money to time ratio, it's a definite "buy".","January 7","true","39.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nostradananas/recommended/345180/","nostradananas","[CPC] Nostra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nostradananas/","871 products in account","Title says it all: it's an ARPG, a genre you can't talk about without mentionning Diablo at some point of the time.\nThe reason is pretty obvious, Diablo was really the pinnacle of the genre. Especially Diablo II, but that's my opinion.\n\nThing is, Diablo II was so damn good it became hard to *really* enjoy the genre for more than a few hours, whereas most fans of the genre probably spent hundreds, if not thousands hours into Diablo.\n\nYet many tried, and many failed. Titan Quest was good and full of good ideas, but due to the lack of promotion and refined online, it didn't work. Torchlight was boring after a playthrough. Plus, it was way too easy to cheat. Van Helsing had its moments, but then again it was so easy to cheat and so short people didn't stick to it. I could mention more and more, but you probably get the idea.\n\nWhat really differentiates this one from the others, you may ask?\nThat's the point of this game really. One of the reasons Diablo II succeeded was that the online pretty much prevented cheating (though there were some shady methods, but certainly not as easy and risk free as duplicating your save). Another is that getting loot was damn easy. Sure, the drop rates were terribly low but running a boss again and again was so easy that it pretty much became the point of playing Diablo. Back then, farming was called MF running.\nHere, in Victor Vran, I'm not exactly sure about the real profitability of running boss instances over and over, but the game definitely makes up for it.\n\nHere's how.\n1) Loot. No good ARPG game without a good loot system. Man, is this one satisfying.\nWhat makes up for the MF runs are not only the MF runs themselves, but also a fantastic addition under the form of bounties and treasure hunts. Basically, you and people can share keys under the chat that you can activate to either receive a bounty or a treasure hunt map. To complete them, you have to visit some maps and either kill some bosses or fetch treasure hints. Upon completing the tasks, you'll get some good loot.\nAnd that's the thing really. This is just the dose of addicting farming an ARPG needs to succeed. Something that keeps you playing and puts you under pressure because the bounties are time limited. As a result, you might feel like doing them with buddies. Oh yeah, there's some online.\n\n2) Online. First of all, whether you prefer playing solo or online with some people, you can still get access to the chat. Meaning you'll get all those damn keys even if you feel like being alone. I haven't tried the game in COOP mode just yet, but I don't see this being anything else than awesome. However, I'm not sure how the loot gets splitted, so you might wanna stick to your friends.\n\n3) Equipement. This is kind of bothering. While there's a neat addition in the form of cards that you can equip to add a various set of features to your build, such as life leech, more melee / ranged damage or cast damage whenever you get it, I'm a bit saddened by the fact there's only one slot for armor. Yep. No gloves, no helmet, just your armor. That said, you can still personnalize your character with the sets of outfits and dye them according to your preference.\nAlso, the skills are weapon based. How does this translate to gameplay?\n\n4) Gameplay. One of the strong features of Diablo II was that you could be pretty much anything. Your build was the one you decided to use, as even sorceress could be damn powerful in melee. This isn't the case in Victor Vran.\nThe skills being weapon based, your build is kind of on rails based on which set of weapons you prefer. Set, because it's so damn easy to switch to your other weapon that you are pretty much going to use both sets of skills.\nWith that being said, Victor Vran is no common hunter as he can uses to "demon powers" which are two bonus spells. Bonus spells that you can actually choose! So in the end, there are some build possibilities. Berserk Aura, one of the demon powers, gives you better damage which is pretty much handy in every scenario. If you're more of a melee guy, Diamond adds you another layer of life in the form of armor. If you wanna stick to the spells, I'm sure Meteors will handle that boss just fine.\nThe demon powers use your second bar, called the Overdrive. This thing is pretty much based on your outfit which gives it a critical importance. Whether you prefer to gain overdrive over time or after each kill is up to you.\n\n6) Misc.\nThe game story is quite nice. Hard to tell much about it without spoiling anything, but basically, demons are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and so are the rulers of the people.\nThe soundtrack is nice though forgettable, but it works fine with the game.\nThe effects of the spells are pretty cool though they stay simple so it's easy to tell what's going on screen. Marvel Heroes made the error of doing way too fancy effects resulting in a general cluster♥♥♥♥, rest assured that's not the case here.\nWhat else... oh yeah! GET THIS GAME. I'm going to be honest, that's the first time I felt this addicted to an ARPG ever since Diablo II and Marvel Heroes.","December 13, 2015","true","60.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Basically, this game is FUN. It might not be perfect, but it does a great job at entertaining.\n\n+ The game is fun as hell, the levels mostly varied, and things remain largely fresh for a lot of the time.\n+ It's an Action RPG, best played with a Controller (from my perspective) but KB+M is just as good. There aren't too many good ARPGs around these days.\n+ The weapons are interesting and all different, especially some of the late-game weapons.\n+ VV is responsive and easy to play with, you aren't likely to die because you tripped over your own feet\n+ Did I mention this game is fun? Imagine Diablo's hack-n-slash, except each button press is a single attack instead of having to click and hold to automatically attack until the enemy is dead. Think Isometric God of War.\n+ Geralt of Rivia is in it. Kinda.\n\n- The game, however, can be boring in parts. You go through enemy after enemy after enemy and they never seem to stop. The most annoying thing? Some of them require a critical hit to die properly; if they're just hit normally, they break apart and come back together again as good as new, so they need to be killed again (although a normal hit will do it that time). There's no way to guarantee the final blow will be critical, although you can improve your chances of a critical several ways.\n- It's less RPG than I'd like. Yes, a deck of cards can be used to increase percentages: Damage, Crit Hit chance, Defense, etc. and outfits act slightly differently (your "mana" for Demon Powers is built up either by Critical hits, taking damage, or over time by itself depending on which outfit you choose). Pick the wrong outfit, and there's no changing your mind 10 minutes later - you're stuck with it for a long time. The problem is there really is no traditional skill progression so to speak, it's all just increased arbitrarily by pickups.\n- I don't find Demon Powers all that useful, at least not until they're upgraded significantly. I also wish weapons were balanced differently: You can hit multiple enemies with a sword or hammer, but a shotgun? Nope, not unless it's using one of its "Special abilities".\n\nAll in all, great game, I highly recommend you give it a go, it's fun to pass some time with and I can guarantee you'll be coming back to it for a long time to come.","December 9, 2015","true","9.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Actually, I bought the whole bundle just for Victor Vran and I didn't regret it. I finished the game around level 40, I still didn't reach the cap level 50 and I enjoy it. It has plenty of maps, bounties and treasure hunts to do and moreover every map has 5 normal and 5 epic challenges to do (epic challenges are unlocked after you finish the game). It also has two extra maps for endless battles. One for endless waves of monsters and one with random quests everyday that give you a special currency that you can trade for legendary items.\n\nOverall, so far I enjoy this game a lot, no matter if I play alone (70% of times) or with a friend (30% of times).

Clearly, a truckload of thought was put in to how each weapon would have different timing and triggers within it's own move-set.  It really keeps you engaged to the action, and rewards you greatly for using your skills intentionally (rather than just mindlessly mashing buttons.)\n\nThe customization options (with the fate cards, and the combination of weapons you will equip) allow for some very thoughtful and useful choices.\n\nI don't make a habit of ever reviewing Steam games - but this one is just so impressive in the execution.  Stick with it, maybe crank the difficulty up a notch or two, and push yourself - this game can be rewarding in the same way as Dark Souls or Bloodborne.","July 27, 2015","true","23.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wizcreations/recommended/345180/","wizcreations","wizcreations","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wizcreations/","74 products in account","Victor Vran is pretty much your generic RPG. The game is fun to play and enjoyable in most aspects, but it's not anything special.  I do recommend this game for it's positive traits, but know ahead of time that there are also some considerable negative traits.\n\nYou have a third-person isometric camera view that you can rotate around your character. You kill things, they drop loot. Difficulty level can be adjusted with any combination of 5 hexes that will cause you to lose health, increase movement speed or attack of enemies, etc. Each area in the map has secrets to find and optional challenges to complete that grant loot, experience, or gold. Your character can equip two weapons, an outfit, two special abilities, two potions, and up to 5/6 cards that grant various perks. Each of these items have their own traits, and you can swap them out from the inventory menu while out in a level, so you can essentially customize your character to exactly suit your play style. You will occasionally find bounties and treasure maps that require you to visit 3 to 5 areas in the map in order to get even more bonus loot. I felt all of these elements meshed together very well to create a fairly enjoyable game. The game also runs incredibly smooth with no lag or frame rate drops to speak of.\n\nBy the way, your character also has the ability to jump, which I seldom seen in RPGs. Jumping is great! It offers a nice way to bypass a group of enemies, and it integrates very well for finding secrets.\n\nDespite all those aspects that I enjoyed, there were far too many aspects I didn't enjoy:\n\nMenu controls are not intuitive, especially when using a controller. I switched to keyboard and mouse every time I went into my inventory or traded with a merchant.\n\nLeveling up requires you to access the inventory screen and choose 1 of 3 bonuses you get for leveling up. If you want to do this while in a map, your character will continue to be attacked while you are stuck navigating through 3 menu screens before the level up is complete. The game should instead just give you the stat bonus for the level and let you choose the item bonus later, but instead you have to choose your bonus before you get the stats increase.\n\nThe thing that completely ruins this game for me is the inventory management. This is hands down the number one reason you would NOT want to play this game. Early on, you have to spend an awful lot of time managing your inventory if you want to always be carrying the best gear. You pick up so many weapons early in the game that you're almost guaranteed to get something that is better than what you're currently using. Later in the game, monsters get more powerful but Rare and Legendary items don't get any stronger. This means you are unable to keep up with the growing difficulty in defeating monsters, causing you to die more often or constantly run away from a fight so you can heal. To account for this, you have the ability to Transmute weapons and items, making them stronger or improving their secondary effects. The problem here is that it takes hundreds of items to level up a pair of weapons to max stats, so if you later find a weapon you like better, you have to repeat the process. AND, you can only increase the stats of an item by using items of equal rarity or better. This means legendary weapons require legendary items in order to level up. In the 26 hours we played, I found a total of 9 legendary weapons, so it was impossible for me to level up any of them any considerable amount.\n\nTransmutation is clearly meant to be a key element of this game, but I hated it. The game punishes you for not choosing a single weapon and sticking with it forever. I liked playing with the Hammer, Rapier, Shotgun, and Mortar, each of which has a particular situation they are well-suited for. Unfortunately, Transmutation is designed so that I must pick one of those to use at all times, unless I want to spend another 20 hours getting enough legendary items to upgrade all of them.\n\nIf you play through the game once to finish the story, it will be fun. If you try to actually level up your character in a way that suits your play style, you'll end up grinding for hours through the same level trying to find more and more items to use in Transmutation. I personally hate grinding, especially since now the only reason to get better weapons is so I can replay levels I've already completed. No thanks!","May 20","true","25.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

An arpg with wasd movement and dodge.\n\nIf you feel it is too easy, at level 12 you will unlock the dificulty modifiers, which allow you to increase the dificulty and get higher rewards. (Ex. Some monsters will be elites. Another modifier makes the monsters have regenerating health which makes the fighting so much more intense, making you play more aggressive)\n\nPlays great both with the keyboard and mouse, and with a Xbox controller\n\nIt lacks the variety of Diablo or Torchlight, but it is a great game regardless.","July 12, 2015","true","7.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Game mechanic is easy to understand, yet it takes time to master.

Even a bit of endgame for a lasting pleasure!\n\nIt's Diablo+Painkiller (don't ask me why) mix with nice music, great graphics and immersive combat. Add to it cooperative game, quick support (I was very surprised to find a bug, report it and it was fixed in next patch which comes just few days after), daily randomly generated map, infinite descending mode, 3 difficulties....\n\nPlayer base it not big, still there are good chances for a random cooperative fun (for those who don't have friends.. haha) or a question answered by another player (even in single player game chat is enabled).

As a 'Living Room Couch' PC gamer, Victor Vran certaintly scratches the itch I have of wanting a Diabloesque action RPG that can be played comfortably with a controller and easy on the eyes as well since I am using a 1080p television.  Smooth gameplay, addicting side quest missions, great graphics and a simple to use UI.  Plus any game that features the suave voice of Geralt of Rivia is A-OK in my books.  I couldn't really get into the Van Helsing games that are also in the genre and didn't feel the controls were as well done in those either...Victor Vran does a much better job, and they aren't nearly as 'clunky'.\n\nAt the moment the big cons for me would be:\n\n- Lack of any in depth skill trees.\n- Lack of overall character customization.\n\nWell worth the current $10 sale price.","February 11","true","12.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hiimtye/recommended/345180/","hiimtye","HiImTye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hiimtye/","100 products in account","overall, my experience with Victor Vran has been positive. instead of game like Diablo, which are very large, open areas pretending to be small, enclosed ones, Victor Vran has a mix of both closed, and open areas, with varied terrain, and a range of weapons that have unique physics which accomodate or are penalized based on them. the mortar, for instance, is very good from above, but more difficult to aim from below, especially on the side.\n\nthere are an array of weapons that vary greatly. there's the rapier, a single target, close range weapon. this weapon offers high armor penetration, and quick strikes, allowing you to dodge in and out and pick off tough enemies first. then there's the hammer, a weapon whose sole job is to slowly smash the ground into crowds of enemies, to do large amounts of damage. personally, I think the hammer needs armor penetration, given the role of combat hammers vs. armor historically, but that's just my opinion. the hammer also compliments other weapons as one of its attacks finishes with a life steal buff that remains when you switch weapons. the sword is a weapon that is excels when you time your attacks and special attacks properly. the third swing of your sword makes enemies vulnerable, making the next attack against them a critical, and your main special attack has its cooldown reset on critical, allowing you to endlessly cycle your attacks. mess up on your cycle, however, and you suffer greatly, as there is a delay at the end of your third swing, like if you fail at striking effectively with a real sword. every weapon has a unique playstyle to it, and you can equip two at a time, and cycle through the two you have equipped, letting you compliment your attacks.\n\nVictor Vran doesn't collect armor in the way that traditional RPGs do, assembling them piece by piece, discarding them as you level. the weapon system does that, and you can grind out new weapons forever. Victor doesn't concern himself on grinding out the perfect buckler to accompany his shiny chestplate. no, he's satisfied with an outfit that provides him with passive bonuses, and altering his playstyle. to compensate, he collects demon cards, which grant him further passive bonuses, some to him, some to his strikes, and others are penalties that he applies to those he strikes, or that strike him. one argument against Victor Vran is the simplicity of the equipment system, but those claims are made by those who have not gone very deep into raising the power of their outfits, or their demon cards.\n\nthere is a potion and bomb system that is very simplistic. I was, and still am underwhelmed by the effectiveness of bombs, for the same reason I am for the levellable 'potion' - the medkit. they use static numbers for damage and healing, rather than a percentage, like ever other potion does. this makes them useful early in the game, but they quickly lose usefulness, especially if you play on a higher difficulty.\n\nlastly, there's a supplimental active ability system in demon powers. there are four main groups of demon powers. the first is the direct attacks group. these are meteor, shockwave, and boomerang. these abilities don't interrupt your regular attacks, and some have secondary effects. the second group is sustained direct damage attacks. in this group are dark mist (turn into a cloud of poison, weakening and damaging enemies), sunray (fire a continuous beam from your hands), and purging flame (control a zone of moving flames, damaging enemies in an AoE). the third group is passive effects. in this group are sanguine aura (health regen/armor), berserk aura (+damage to everyone in range, even mobs), and diamond (damage absorb/ranged reflect). the last group is utility. in this one is blink (teleport, damage a single enemy, and make him vulnerable), pull (shoot out a number of projectiles, pulling them to you, and stunning them for a period of time), and time bubble (create a zone in which enemies and enemy projectiles are slowed, but friendlies and friendly projectiles are not). I find that the powers in which you lose the ability to be active aren't powerful enough to justify using them, while enemies that use them don't have to lose the ability to be acive. in particular, enemies have the ability to place a sunray that spins outward slowly from a focal point, that you do not.\n\nthe difficulty system is achieved in the way of 'hexes' that make enemies more difficult, but also provide more experience and loot (a la Bastion, et al). there is also a hard mode, which turns on all hexes and supposedly provides some other buff to enemies, but I've been unable to locate any documentation about this to confirm it.\n\nin Victor Vran, you can also jump, which is useful both from a time saving standpoint (as in other games, you would have to go all the way around, just to get over that stupid railing), and an exploration one (to find secret areas). you can wall vault up to twice before landing, which means you can scale some two-wall areas to reach otherwise unreachable areas, some hidden, and some not. this helps to eliminate a lot of wasted time, and also makes level design less bland. dodging is also a very important mechanic, and allows you to both travel faster (Victor Vran's version of the FPS bunnyhop), and also avoid enemy attacks. it immediately interrupts attacks, which is a welcome mechanic, one that some games lack (Fight the Dragon, I'm looking at you).\n\nit runs reasonably well on my system, using Arch Linux, but there have been some technical issues. principally, F1 (used to file a bug report) has created an instant crash on Linux for some time, and has still not been addressed. former incarnations of the game also seemed to be a bit more optimized, and there are some random crashing and networking issues.","May 13","true","287.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

If you're reading this you probably already know what the game is. You're a demon hunter called to investigate a city overrun by demons.\n\nWhile I'm writing this review I haven't finished the game yet. I'm playing this game with a friend of mine in coop. I have played a lot of its competitors like Diablo, Sacred, Torchlight and what not. I will refer to them frequently.\n\nThe game has quiet a lot to offer, hence while I would recommend it.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are slightly more demanding than Diablo 3, but the game runs fluid on a mediocre system. It looks pretty and I haven't had a single graphical glitch during my sessions.\n\nDifficulty:\nI played the game on normal and it's a fair difficulty. Just as a reminder I play multiplayer not solo. So the game might be a lot more difficult in single player. There're three difficulty levels: Casual, Normal and Hard. For an even further challenge you can even play Hardcore (perma-death). During my sessions I died quite a lot, but I'll come back to that later...\n\nAudio:\nThe voice over is awesome. The narrator did an incredibly good job capturing the atmosphere of the game. Victor tends to talk to himself a lot, refering to the voice in his head as headman. Those monologues are brilliant sometimes. The downside is, that all the other characters fade a bit in his shadow.\nThe musical score is good, but nothing to write home about.\nI noticed a crackling sound every now and then which is quite annoying. Haven't found a fix yet.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is quite different from what I was used to. There are no classes or races, just Victor Vran. But there is still room for some customization. You can choose from an arsenal of different weapons (e.g. Rapier, Sword, Hammer, Shotgun). Each weapon has a different skill set: a standard attack and two special abilities. You can equip up to two weapons simultaneously. Swapping weapons during a fight is just one click. There is no classic magic system. Instead you have a demon power item which you can equip two of. It's a little like Sacred 2, tho you cannot upgrade those "runes". Last but not least, there's armor which you can get by reaching a certain level.\nYou can carry around two different sets of items. One of which is usually occupied by the health pots. You can equip buff potions, bombs and medi kits as well.\nFinally there are destiny cards which further enhances your stats (e.g. critical chance, critical damage, health).\n\nOf all the equipment there're four different qualities. White, Green, Gold and Purple. So no real difference to all the other ARPGs out there. Only difference are the destiny cards. Some of them have a slightly glowing effect to them. Those are divine cards, which have some additional effects.\n\nThe maps are really great. Every map has a different medieval theme and they look gorgeous. There is no random map generation tho, so replay value is limited. Each map has five challenges, which give bonus XP, gold or items. Some want you to defeat champions, others to achieve a certain number of kills with one weapon. Later some need you to activate hexes, which either buff monsters or debuff you.\n\nAlso every map has a set number of secrets to find. Those are item or gold chests.\n\nThe number of different enemies seems a bit limited so far. Most share the same model and have just a few different animations. There're some hilarious gimmicks, but a few more different mobs wouldn't hurt the game at all.\n\nControls:\nAnd here comes the big let down. The controls are abysmal at best. There're two different control sets. Normal and Mouse Movement. Normal is WASD movement control, which is... well... you might get used to it... I simply can't. I played every ARPG on god's planet with mouse movement... why you might think not in this game? Well... to be honest the mouse movement is totally broken. You might remember Diablo. You click with your left mouse button and the character moves to this position. You hold the left mouse button and the character moves in the direction your mouse cursor points. This totally holds true for this game, but... not really. The most distinct feature of Victor Vran, namely elevation and jumping, made a total mess of that. I have been in High Quarter yesterday. To reach a certain secret chest you have to jump up over a few balconies and down on a roof. Sounds easy... yeah... no! The game has a problem calculating the exact position of your movement order. I was walking on the roof. On the backside of the mansion was an alleyway. You can access it if you walk around the house. But while I was clicking on the roof, the game thought I clicked on the alleyway behind the house. So Victor moved in every direction instead of the one I was pointing at. Also jumping over fences or hedges can get frustrating if you're not at the right angle or distance. The only workaround is, to constantly rotate the camera in a position where there're no obstacles. As much as I love this game, this really makes me want to rage quit sometimes.\n\nI really enjoy the game so far. But the controls need a serious overhaul.","October 4, 2015","true","6.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The thing I love especially is the ability to completely play with a mouse. To most that would seem tedious and boring, but for me it's a relief. I can only use one hand, so games where you usually have to block/dodge etc. can be hard to do if it requires both keyboard and mouse to execute a certain action that involves moving and blocking/dodging at the same time. The fact that one can actually choose from 3 different options on how to play the game is something more developers should implement in their games. The choice of HOW to play, and make it therefore also more easy for those who love to play games, but can only use one hand. Diablo III is also very playable with one hand. Grim Dawn is another. There are games that are very playable. But the majority of cool games alas do not support it so far.

I bought it by chance, as there was no hype about it, and soon realized that I got a gem.\nAdditionally to good graphics, great soundtrack and awesome refreshing game mechanics it offers good story for an action RPG and one of the best (if not the very best) support for gamepad. Don't get me wrong, playing with mouse and keyboard is not worse, but there are not so many PC games that support controller so good. Plus it's very stylish and atmospheric. The last but not the least, the game runs without any bugs.\n\nThe only important drawback is that game is short and has not enough replay value. There are no real side quests, and for me additional "challenges" are not so interesting. I've just finished it first time, and honestly speaking want to start it again, but I understand that it is going to be more of the same.\n\nAnyway, after boring experince of Diablo 3 and Torchligh 2, Victor Vran is just a breath of fresh air.

What's better than one Victor Vran? Four Victor Vrans! Anyway. I'm loving this game. Bought it a couple of nights ago on sale, grabbed a two pack and played with a friend who is also loving it. The combat is fun, fluid and punishing! When you get to a certain level you unlock these brilliant little things called Hexes that you can activate and deactivate at will; they make the game harder by upping Armor Regeneration or making monsters hit harder while you're awarded more XP and a higher chance at loot. We instantly turned on 4 out of 5 Hexes and went to town.\n\nThe ability to move the camera around opens up the map and lets you discover secrets and hidden areas where there might spawn some cool monsters. It really does feel fresh if you're coming from something like Diablo III (where we've spent XXX hours..). The jump mechanic is pretty cool too, especially when you make it on your first jump instead of jumping needlessly into a wall. But most of all, seriously, most of all - even though it can be hard and all that stuff, it's still a super casual game in my mind. Can't wait for the weekend so I can just play this until sunday.","December 15, 2015","true","11.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The combat feels rewarding, though at times it can be repetitive, but the polish makes up for it. Works perfectly with a controller, and even inventory management works well. It's clear the developer wanted the experience to be as smooth on controller as on K+M.\n\nIt is not a co-op game at heart. Co-op was tacked on after the fact and it is evident. Quests track separately, loot tracks separately, objectives track separately. Basically, you can play with another person, but you gain nothing. It's so separate that I stopped bothering and went to single player mode.\n\nIs it worth $20? For the work the devs put in: absolutely. There's a lot of content here and lots of areas to have fun in. I will say that this game is more for completionist, who enjoy finding all the secrets in an area, or meeting all level objectives. If you're not into that, then you'll simply run through each level, and will most likely end up bored. For completionists, there's a lot of depth and content here.\n\nIf the game is on sale, then pick it up without hesitation.

You've got weapons, armor, demon spells, runes, cards, transmogs, uniforms...all of those things you need to keep a super close eye on and you've dozens of areas in which you need to spend your gold.  I personally haven't invested any time in keeping up with the runes or transmog parts of the game, but it could easily be where all of your gold goes, leaving you with zero spending cash when that awesome weapon arrives.\n\nThe online multiplayer lets you join anyone who has an open room, but will still only let you advance by how far YOU'VE gotten in the story (to avoid power leveling I assume).  But if I join a friends game and they are further in the story than me but 2 levels below me, then we're both making a sacrifice to play together.\n\nThe camera/point and click movement can be a pain often times as well. You'll want to click to go somewhere, but instead you click something that is in the foreground but was invisible (as to not obstruct the player's view) and you'll move in a different direction.\n\nOverall, I enjoy this game. But I feel that very soon I am going to hit a spot in the game where I can't proceed because my character is too weak because I haven't invested the time into the cards or transmogging anything.","August 9, 2015","true","7.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I like the graphics and the game style, but i have to say this game gets boring quite fast. I haven't done all the challenges yet and those are really hard since if enemy has Blink, Pull, Nightmare or any similar Demon power and your challenge is to kill X amount of monsters without using Demon powers you fail the mission pretty much instantly.\n\nI'm still going to play this game and try to reach and do the challenges. I've started on Hard mode and it seems the only fun mode currently. You actually have to dodge and give your everything to survive. There is few negative things like Pull into insta death, but luckily there isn't hardcore mode yet.\n\nHaven't tried PvP either and i think that will be quite unbalanced. (Range weapon with blink and some other weapon or melee with Pull & rapier)\n\nHope they add more levels and more content to this game.","August 8, 2015","true","25.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The combat feels rewarding, though at times it can be repetitive, but the polish makes up for it. Works perfectly with a controller, and even inventory management works well. It's clear the developer wanted the experience to be as smooth on controller as on K+M.\n\nIt is not a co-op game at heart. Co-op was tacked on after the fact and it is evident. Quests track separately, loot tracks separately, objectives track separately. Basically, you can play with another person, but you gain nothing. It's so separate that I stopped bothering and went to single player mode.\n\nIs it worth $20? For the work the devs put in: absolutely. There's a lot of content here and lots of areas to have fun in. I will say that this game is more for completionist, who enjoy finding all the secrets in an area, or meeting all level objectives. If you're not into that, then you'll simply run through each level, and will most likely end up bored. For completionists, there's a lot of depth and content here.\n\nIf the game is on sale, then pick it up without hesitation.

I see many people saying this is a Van Helsing clone.  I disagree with this as I have Van helsing 1 and 2.  The games play very differently.\n\nMy only complaint so far is the need to use WASD for movement, I am uncomfortable using that playing an isometric ARPG.  I find myself spamming the attack button just to move :) I understand that being this game has a jump mechanic why the DEVS may have thought WASD was a better way to go. Many gaming mice nowadays have enough buttons that a jump could easily be bound to a button. I would at least like to see an option for mouse movement instead of only WASD.   This game also supports a controller, however I am not a controller type player in any game.\n\nOverall Early impressions:  I like the game and I think it has potential.  I like that the DEVS have a clear roadmap of where they plan to take the game and I look forward to spending more time in the Victor Vran world.\n\nUPDATE:  As of today (3/13/15) Victor Vran has added the option for mouse movement.  It is great to see developers listen to thier community and add that option for those of us who requested it.  I also like that it is an OPTION rather then changing the scheme entirely and maybe angering those who actually liked the WASD scheme.

Alot...\n\nThis game copies alot from ARPG's that came before it, but also adds alot, and does some stuff differently to make it stand out from the pack.. The ability to jump and dodge roll are great additions to this style of game, and really make combat feel more fluid..  I have over 300 hours in D3, and that has basically become a stand and DPS style game, a tactic which will simply get you killed in VV.\n\nHexes are a great way to increase the difficulty of the game.. I found the game quite easy without hexes on, but turning on hexes improves the difficulty and challenge of the game, and I think makes you a better player... You really need to understand the attacks and patterns of the enemies with hexes on, to have any hope of surviving!\n\nThe card system for character development is unique, and you can create a number of different builds through the configuration of cards. The game might not have different classes, but with weapon and card combos, you can basically build your own classes up and play different play styles..\n\nSpeaking of weapons, most ARPGs it is the legendary items that everyone chases, however in VV through the crafting system, with a bit of knowledge and good luck, you can make weapons that out perform their legendary cousins, which is a feature i love. Not everyone is running around with the same damn sword like most games, and the crafting system is not overly complicated, featuring an in game recipe list, however sometimes getting the items you need can be the challenge!\n\nThe inclusion of secrets and challenges has been a great addition! the secrets make you want to explore as you go, and combined with the jumping feature can make searching for all the secrets a great deal of fun!  Each map also has its own set of challenges, some more challenging than others, some require different hexes, some require different weapons, some require multiplayer to achieve, but again it is something on each map to aim for, as opposed to simply running and gunning through!\n\nThe end game faces the same challenges as all games.. Once you hit the level cap, you gain renown instead, and completing bounties and treasure hunts, (in which you can find your own codes or share them in multiplayer) is a great way to keep going, and if you read the developer road map in the forums, the future of this game looks great!\n\nThx to Haemimont for making this game, i am really enjoying it, and hope to for a long time to come!  If you enjoy ARPG's, I can not recomend this game enough!  Have fun, happy gaming :D","August 17, 2015","true","63.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

What's better than one Victor Vran? Four Victor Vrans! Anyway. I'm loving this game. Bought it a couple of nights ago on sale, grabbed a two pack and played with a friend who is also loving it. The combat is fun, fluid and punishing! When you get to a certain level you unlock these brilliant little things called Hexes that you can activate and deactivate at will; they make the game harder by upping Armor Regeneration or making monsters hit harder while you're awarded more XP and a higher chance at loot. We instantly turned on 4 out of 5 Hexes and went to town.\n\nThe ability to move the camera around opens up the map and lets you discover secrets and hidden areas where there might spawn some cool monsters. It really does feel fresh if you're coming from something like Diablo III (where we've spent XXX hours..). The jump mechanic is pretty cool too, especially when you make it on your first jump instead of jumping needlessly into a wall. But most of all, seriously, most of all - even though it can be hard and all that stuff, it's still a super casual game in my mind. Can't wait for the weekend so I can just play this until sunday.","December 15, 2015","true","11.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's fast-paced, beautiful and the sound track is awesome. It's a solid 5/7.\n\nPros:\n- people with arachnophobia get to kill a lot of spiders;\n- you get stuff when you level up. Not always useful, but stuff. More often than not it is useful, though, and if you don't like it, you can sell it;\n- you can jump and uncover secrets this way (be weary of conspicuously placed pillars), dodge enemy ranged attacks by jumping over the projectiles, navigate some mazes a lot easier;\n- the narrator. You will either love him or hate him. Just the right amount of sass for my taste, reminded me of the one in The Stanley Parable.\n- because Victor Vran is Victor Vran and not each players rendition of Victor Vran or Viktoria Vranovskaya, the trans-gender bearded female version whom they decided to make wear a skirt, you can jump right in once the quick download is finished (~3.5 Gb, I think, for the ones who are still on a plan);\n- quick transitions to and from the keep where the base is located;\n- next to no loading times (literally, <1s on a decent but by no means fancy gaming PC, not installed on SSD);\n- overkill mechanic is an interesting concept that I haven't seen before - I didn't really play a lot of aRPGs so that may be why;\n- good humor;\n- control is spot on using both keyboard + mouse and controller;\n- Private Stash (you'll know it when you see it).\n\nCons:\n- people with arachnophobia get to see a lot of spiders;\n- caught a few glitches when entering dialogues with the NPCs where the screen froze for half a second - not every time, noticeable but not really disturbing;\n- only happened once so far but the game would not let me jump off of a platform to a different lower level unless I did it  from a specific spot.\n- story line does not feel engaging - but story line should not be why you buy an aRPG after all\n\nFinal score, based totally on whatever I feel like, would be an 83/100 or even an 8.3/10. I would have liked to see just a sliver more on the story side.","December 10, 2015","true","13.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The graphics are nice but the camera is zoomed out so you won't be studying any intricate details.

I am more than stoked to say that it's amazing and you should definitely pick it up if you are any kind of fan of the ARPG genre.  The game has great combat (move camera movement down to 0 and play with a gamepad) even if the story is only servicable, given it's your common 'Van Helsing battles the ooglie booglie" schluck.  That's OK though, since the gameplay is exactly what it needs to be and that is all that matters.  If you were ever a fan of the older PS2 era Balder's Gate ARPG games (like Balder's Gate: Dark Allliance) you'll feel right at home here.  If you, also, enjoyed the semi-recent Gauntlet game, you'll also like this and understand what genre niche it fits into.\n\nBUY IT........SUPPORT THE SYSTEM.......PURCHASE PURCHASE SHEEPLE........GIVE THE MAN YOUr MONEY!!!!!!!!\n\nPros: The game play is smooth, weapon switching worksk well, powers are fun, and cards give good passives that suit your playstyle.  Graphics, also, are very servicable with bright colors and nicely crafted environments.\n\nCons: backtracking...ugh.  The story is kind of "meh" and told is a underwelling fashion (a lot of static images used in lieu of animated cutscenes or passive storytelling).  There isn't a lot of loot in this game either.  You'll pick up a decent assortment of weapons but they won't be all that interesting to people who are used to games like Diablo or Torchlight since they often look the same, have very similar base stats, and only differ in random perks assignments.  The big issue is this: no armor slots.  Instead, they went with a costume system that gives you different perks based on the costume you wear.  Unfortunately, this cuts down on player customization since you'll stick with the costume that gives the best perks for your playstyle, even if it's not the one you are most interested in visually.\n\nEither way, the game is a ton of fun and a great way to kill time on your main monitor while you watch pron on your secondary.........\n\nor don't......your choice............though, in my opinion, you're wasting your time (and grip strength).....\n\nWhat would Solid Snake think?  You built up all that grip strength, his name IS Solid, AND you bought the family sized pack of Kleenex from Costco.

It doesn't take itself seriously and has some pretty huge winks at other games. This lighthearted tone goes throughout the game with a voice inside Victor's head that offers some good jokes here and there.\n\nI just wish that the developers used these mechanics to deepen the gameplay even more and make it more varied. I have to admit that after finishing the main story in coop, I just felt that I saw everything that the game had to offer. Sure, there were plenty of other challenges to tackle but I did not want to go back and slay hundreds of the generic spiders, skeletons and vampires. (And don't get me started on those essence type of enemies...)\n\nThe game could have definitely used more weapon and enemy variety because its combat system is what makes it unique among other ARPGs. After a couple of hours, you figure out what weapons and spells work for you the best and that's pretty much it. You're stuck with generic landscapes and enemies for the rest of the game and this will be a letdown for many players.\n\nUltimately, it earns my recommendation because in coop, it is fun with a friend. However, I wish it offered a bit more variety in its gameplay and setting to hook players in the long run. For this reason, I recommend picking it up on a sale.","April 15","true","9.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In reality, it's more of an action game with a bunch of RPG elements. There's a lot of buffs and debuffs and damages and armors but most of it can be ignored during the slaughter. The key gameplay mechanics are dodging - something you'll be doing a lot of in the action game way, by rolling from projectiles, jumping over shockwaves and whatnot - and mastering weapons.\nThere's under twenty weapon types, but each handles differently (by having three attacks associated with it) and each has different mechanics associated with it - so with a shotgun you'll be timing shots and executing enemies, with a scythe you'll harvest souls of and use them to empower your moves and with a rapier you'll be counting your hits to get the maximum out of its combo-empowering abilities.\nYou can switch between two weapons on the fly and you aren't locked out of any by stat requirements - simply because there aren't any stats. You get passive boosts by equipping a set of cards with values associated with them and figuring out the most effective hand of cards you can use with your limited capacity is actually quite fun.\nThe emphasis on action gameplay is also further reflected in level design - the maps aren't randomly generated and there is a set of challenges on each one to complete for extra loot and experience; those range from "accidently fulfilled" to "good luck figuring out a build that can do this" in difficulty - and if that isn't enough, another set of (really rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly) challenges for each map opens up on beating the final boss.\n\nGraphics are nice enough, could use less spiders but that's a pretty common issue with RPG devs running out of ideas. I think this game actually suffered a bit in the story/presentation department by coming out at around the same time as Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, with which it apparently shares a lot of style - hell, even logo/title screen with a steampunky hatted hunter looking in your general direction. I wouldn't call Victor Vran derivative, though; for one, his hat gets mercilessly mocked throughout the game.\nWhich brings me to the story and writing and what's actually tying all that murder together. The story is minimal - there's this cursed city and you're there to figure out what happened and destroy the ancient evils, blah blah skeletons vampires ghosts demons. The game is thankfully aware of how shallow this is and pokes fun at it quite a lot. Victor Vran doesn't take itself seriously - at all. Your constant companion is a snarky voice in your head that isn't ever afraid to deliver a low blow to your confidence - from the abovementioned hat mockery through pondering the meaning of mass murder for loot and experience to videogame references. The jokes are mostly rather memetic in substance and a lot of them fall flat but they're usually delivered fast enough to make at least some of them stick - my favorite is probably the Stanley Parable dungeon.\n\nI don't think this game will ever become a beloved classic, but it's definitely a step above the typical point-and-kill ARPG in gameplay and gets a lot of points in my book for its admitted and embraced silliness. Definitely worth getting on a sale.\n","April 10","true","17.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The developers got their core gameplay right: The weapons are well balanced, yet easily distinguishable from one another (especially with their supporting special-abilities). Significant challenge comes from not being able to spam your healing items. Opponents are varied throughout the critical-path to the endgame, and manage to usually be more than just damage sponges.\n\n...and there are a couple of good, solid plot-twists, too.\n\nAs to downsides:\n\nLike some other games that feature it, "synthesis" of loot isn't all that much fun. It takes a lot to make the weapons more interesting than they already are, and the loot-combo outcomes don't usually get you much. In the end, I just shrugged my shoulders a the mechanic. In the same vein, loot drops pretty slowly, and it's tough to get anything that is really nifty, or a basic-but-noticeable improvement over what you're already carrying.\n\nThe above plays significantly into the game actually getting very "samey" after you're more than about 50% along. This is not to say that the main game path doesn't keep revealing new enemies and environments to you - quite the opposite, in fact. The issue is that all the ancillary places you can visit end up feeling like filler. After a short while, there really isn't a reason to go looking around in all the areas that are available. The rewards for doing so are abstract, and a little stingy. You might complete some challenges, level up, and get some extra money, but it doesn't do much to give you an extra edge - and even with a variety of monsters and environments, at some point the "tweak these variables and repeat" thing gets pretty obvious.\n\nSo...stick to the main game, and enjoy it. I personally can't see spending tens upon tens of hours with "Victor Vran," but going through the core experience was definitely worth the price of admission.","April 30","true","17.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game features a classless progression model where the weapon types define the skills you use. The entire loot curve is about breaking down the weapons and items you don't want, to augment the ones that you do. The game uses set pieces for the levels instead of randomly generated ones, but each area has a variety of challenges for you to go after for more rewards.\n\nThe game does feel a bit repetitive over time, but that's just the nature of the hack and slash genre. Hopefully it will do well for the devs and we can see more content for old Victor.","August 7, 2015","true","20.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

You would think that such a dark setting would be super serious right? Well it can be, if it weren't for the brilliantly emotive voices in your head.\n\nI thouroughly enjoyed my time with the game, but now that I am in the end game I find myself being drawn back to Rocket League and not wanting to go back to it to complete the elite challenges. Still, awesome game and you can watch my full, in depth review of the game on the video I'm linking here, as it showcases 20 minutes of gameplay then goes into my own category review system.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who has any interest in a action RPG. I had more fun with this than I did back when i played Diablo 3 for the first time (until Reaper of Souls came out that is) and it raises the bar in many ways. I love the seemless weapon switching, the Destiny card system, as well as the hexes (skulls from halo) to make each level slightly more difficult. Great game, i recommend buying it even at full price!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/aaV3fOyNVIY","August 5, 2015","true","16.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Skills are closer to the GW2 style of having most the skills tied to the weapon type your using giving you minimal customization on two slots.  Talents are non exsistant replaced by "card slots" that are mostly passive stat upgrades or proc chance things so while they do allow a bit of tayloring your character you only get a few active at a time and there is nothing all that interesting. And like Diablo asteticly (spelling) everything is very similar in art style and feel, which some may like and some may dislike... I personally liked varrying looks in Torchlight 2 but thats subjective.\n\nAllright with the negitives out of the way lets get to some of the possitives. The combat feels good, it feels enjoyable which is something I never really got out of Diablo games, its got some skill required (well atleast more skill then most Diablo genre games need) and you can jump and wall jump which can be used for tatical reasons in combat. Also with jumping in the game they add hidden chests through out the levels that are interesting to try to find, levels have some replayability with each level having a set of 5 challenges to try to complete.\n\nAll in all I would say I enjoy it more then D3 but less the Torchlight 2, its definitly got consolification and dumbing down things that take away from what could have been a great addition to the genre, but it's still good, specailly compairing that this isn't the genre this company normaly does. I would say pick it up on sale, but at full price TL2 is a better buy.","June 12, 2015","true","1.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The skill system is similar to Guild Wars 2 where you're given 3 unique abilities based on the weapon you're using, and you can switch between 2 different weapons freely giving you access to 6 weapon abilities total. On top of this you're also given 2 demon powers which are strong abilities that charge during combat. Finally you're given 2 consumable slots which can be used for potions, bombs, medi kits and buffs.\n\nCharacter customisation comes in the way of cards, you're given a certain amount of card slots and card points, similar to the Call of Duty loadout system. These cards allow you to build how you'd like by adding passives to your character, you can opt for a couple of high point cards or many low point cards depending on your needs. It's not the most deep system but it does the job.\n\nWhere the game really excels is presentation, it looks, runs and sounds great. I was very impressed with just how polished the game actually is. I enjoyed the art style and the overall visuals were beautiful with some fantastic little cut scenes thrown in throughout the story. Speaking of the story, it was interesting and fully voiced, and voiced well. You may recognise the voice actor for Victor Vran as he also voiced Geralt in Witcher III. The game also performs really well, I spent the entire 15 hour playthrough at 60fps locked on ultra settings, I will say one thing though, the in-game VSync is not recommended as it uses double buffering, so any tiny dip in frame rate causes the FPS to half down to 30fps. You can fix this 100% by disabling VSync in-game and forcing it on in your GPU control panel, I personally used adaptive VSync with triple buffering and my experience was rock solid.\n\nI have to say I was pleasantly surprised with the game on the whole, it's definitely worth it even at full price, and especially so at £5 in the sale. I thoroughly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the genre.","March 5","true","17.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Combining a strong, item-based ability system with movement-based gameplay akin to platformers such as the Prince of Persia series. It also features an ongoing narration in the vain of Bastion. Highly recommended.","July 23, 2015","true","20.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I've read something about that. At least, the setting reminds of something that I have read on the official facebook page.\n\nAnyway, back to the game:\n\nFirst off: Yes, this game is very early Beta (If not even Alpha).\n- Some images are missing and replaced with Placeholder images\n- The game is short, ... very short\n\nIs it boring? Absolutely not, slaying Spiders, Skeletons and a bunch of other creatures have never been so much fun to me since Dungeon and Dragons on the XBox (the good old one). Fast game play, very good controlling using a gamepad and the graphics are looking sweet.\n\nWho shall play this game?\nAnyone who is not too much afraid about Spiders and thought that Diablo lacks of action.\n\nDuring my first hour of gameplay, I had so much fun jumping to the enemies, deal loads of damage and jump away to avoid their counter attacks (there is a dodge introduced quite early in the game, but I did not manage it yet on actually dodging an attack. Hope that this will be somehow getting a bit easier to understand).\n\n\n--- and what are now my new opinions on this game since I spent 2 hours on it?\nCharacter development is really nice.\nYou do not have to create a character from scratch, as Victor evolves by your choices. By collecting and combining destiny cards, you can be anything you like. As I prefer to tank through the enemies in close combat, I made a selection of "High melee damage" and "Vampirism" and combined it with a sword that sends out exploding impulses from time to time. But you can be anything you like, as long you find the cards for it and the right weapon.\n\n---\n\nAfter my first hour in the game, I rated the game with a personal score of 85%, but more I'm in the game and find out things the more fun it is. Score increased to 87%!\n\nBut keep in mind, there is no story yet... you only have a couple of quests that you can do, nothing more... if it is really that closely connected to the upcoming motörhead game, and the story will be nice, it is a candidate for a 90%+ rating :)","February 23, 2015","true","3.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

I'll point out some aspects of the game I liked first:\n\nPros\n~Multiplayer that isn't a hassle.\n~Full range of interesting weapons.\n~Customizable builds based on style of play. For instance, if you want to tank, there is a setup for that.\n~Said setup is made based on Destiny Cards. These aren't too hard to find (some given during level-ups).\n~Diablo-style legendary items (no sets). The weapons I got that had legendary effects were fun to use and I tried my hardest to keep them in my inventory at all times.\n~Able to change loadout on the fly.\n~Large amount of inventory, even for those pesky low-level cards that you need to hoard.\n~Boss fights that will keep you on your toes\n\nNow this was my experience before around level 25. After this the gameplay changed, and so did the need for new ways of tackling the game.\n\nCons\n~Getting certain items in multiplayer (esp. lightning guns) will kill your friends in a heartbeat if they are melee. Friendly fire should not have been included.\n~Some legendary weapons are too OP to pass up.\n~The game forces you to play at a harder difficulty to obtain said legendaries.\n~The increased difficulty creates a huge gap from the original gameplay. It honestly felt like a completely different game. Not just a harder game, an impossible one. Here's why:\nEnemies can have any Demonic skill in game, including a 5 second stun and pull. No build, even full defense, can handle this later in game. The monsters that can cast this ability are multiplied at this level. You will run into them, and they will murder you.\n~Builds become cookie-cutter. Tanks are no longer viable, and the only build you can use includes certain OP legendary items with high-damage output/vamp.\n~Money will always be a problem if you decide not to grind.\n~You will decide to grind anyway because once you increase the difficulty (which some areas require to pass their achievements) you will run into problems.\n~Upgrading cards to have Wicked/Divine stats becomes a larger grind than getting OP weapons.\n~Last thing- every area in the game will scale it's difficulty to your level. Going back to old content won't mean easier content.\n\n\nI became so fustrated with this game after a while and had to stop. I consider myself a common gamer, and this game's difficulty curve is very, very high. Would not recommend to new or softcore gamers. I played  this game in multiplayer with a hardcore gamer, and he was happy with the game in it's current state. To all his own.","July 29, 2015","false","19.9"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","17","31","0","1"

Most importantly the combat is fluid and the controls are great both for the controller and M+K. I use a Logitech 710 controller and it works great.\n\nThe setting is hard to describe.

You can equip destiny cards to add special effects to your attacks.

Completed the game in 5 hours, not including other side quests. The game is fairly difficult in normal mode but the boss isn't that much of a threat. It bring new mechanics to the action rpg games such as jumping, etc. Sure it's fun but mostly just grinding for me and only exciting to see new bosses and loots. Other than that, can't really find anything to like about it. Recommend to buy when on sale of 50% or more if not don't buy it in full price as it's not worth it. The weapons and outfits look cool as hell tho.","February 8","true","5.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Skills are assigned based on the weapons, tomes, and spells you have equipped, so as you gain better items, your skills will become stronger. You can equip destiny cards to add special effects to your attacks. (All of these items can be made more powerful via the transmuting system.)\n\nEach map comes with its own set of achievements, so if you're an achievement fetishist, that will appeal to you. I also think that this game's maps are a little prettier and more varied than most of the ARPG's I've played on Steam.\n\n9/10, my only issue being that some day I'd like to play a game like this that has a more robust story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roelthedeer/recommended/345180/","roelthedeer","Roel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roelthedeer/","239 products in account","Much more fun than I expected - 8/10\n\nVictor Vran is a really interesting case of taking your typical ARPG hack'n'slash game and mixing in some more direct control than the genre got us used to, as well as turning the class and build issue on its head. What we get is a really enjoyable exercise in mowing down hundreds of enemies without much repetitiveness kicking in.\n\nCharacter progression is tied to loot much more than usually in such games - since Victor has no skills of his own, only the set of them dependant on the weapons (you can quickly swap between two) wielded, the best tools of destruction you get are going to influence your experience quite a bit until the next big drop. And we are talking real variety. With the sword in hand the game is a crit-based slash-fest, shotgun provides some more control and a slight rhythm-element, scythes add secondary resource to strengthen your attacks, tomes provide great positional control at the cost of engaging in a 'minigame' of picking up special powerups... it is quite a treat, and no two types of a weapon work the same. In the later parts, Legendary versions of the weapons start appearing - these don't just give different stats, they also directly modify some of the abilities granted by your weapon.\nTo back these up, Vran can also equip up to 5 Destiny Cards, that grant either passive or triggered bonuses (and can randomly have another one in the form of Wicked/Divine boon), two Demon Powers (additional activated skills, weapon-agnostic) and an Outfit, which modifies stats and/or base mechanics of the game, usually related to the charging of Overdrive, a fancy name for what is basically a rage-bar that powers Demon Powers.\n\nAnd that's it. No talents, no skills, no attributes... quite a novelty, with its own set of upsides and downsides. The good is, once you find a weapon type you like more than the previous you use, switching is not a problem. With a proper set of Cards, Powers, and Outfits, any combination of weapons can be re-adjusted to. Which, in turn, kills much of the possible repetitiveness.\nThankfully, the high dependence on gear doesn't hurt as much - the crafting system in Victor Vran is built to make sure you can continue using just the weapon you like the most; leftover loot can be used to increase critical chance, damage, and power of special properties of your weapon, going even as far as adding one property of your liking (provided you can 'craft' it). By combining lesser weapons of a specific rarity and type the player has a chance to craft a higher-rarity weapon of the same type, so getting better sort of your favourite weapon isn't all that hard either.\n\nAt the same time, this means that no specialized and truly intricate builds are achievable. Which becomes even more apparent as some of game's balance issues are revealed. Victor Vran favours critical hits by the virtue of having a lot of effects that can be triggered either on a critical hit or overkill (killing an enemy with quite a bit more damage than was needed), of which critical hits are easier to achieve. If you back it up with the fact that Sword is a premiere critical-hit based weapon and Sword-centric Destiny Card is stupidly powerful for sustaining yourself... yeah, you can guess how I built my character pretty much by default. There are also slight concerns about some weapons being just too unwieldy or fun but not powerful enough (non-legendary Tomes are problematic, and Lighting Gun seems like the clunkiest thing ever to me) but it might be on the fact that I wasn't the greatest player skill-wise.\n\nDespite the above, you can still enjoy any sort of weapon combo you decide to stick with, and if it happens to be too powerful... well, the game has you covered. With 5 activable Curses, which strengthen your enemies in specific ways while increasing the experience gain, you can quite easily make sure that the enemies can and will overpower you. Mix in the map-unique Challenges, which are sets of arbitrary tasks to perform for additional rewards (and 5 more of them for each map are achievable once you complete the game once) and there is a lot to do.\n\nSo, the gameplay is great, but what else is there? ... not much, actually.\nThe story is ore of a throw-away, even if it doesn't present itself terribly. It is just uninspired and serves mostly as a reason for all the slaughter to occur, rather than a point of focus. Voice acting is kept on a sensible level, aside from how edgy our protagonist appears - both in lines and delivery, but the lines aren't inspired all that much overall. Side characters have some interesting bits to say sometimes, and the Voice proves to be amusing on a handful of maps, but that's about it. Just a slight spicing for the gameplay.\nArt and music actually positively surprised me, especially the latter - fits the mood perfectly, even if the mood is built on the premise of your typical 'spooky' invasion of countless ghosts, skeletons, vampires, gargoyles, spiders... if not for occasional elementals, you could say that the entire range of enemies is just Halloween scares. Thankfully, the lack of interesting creations is backed up by how varied their methods of attack and ways to deal with them are.\n\nI can safely recommend this title, great fun for a good price - at the time of writing, I had 22 hours clocked, which is enough to complete the game with around 70% base challenges done. Which puts me at roughly 35% of them now that new ones appeared.","April 22","true","22.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've seen it somewhere...\n-Some boss fights are boring\n-THOSE DAMN ENEMIES,GETTING BACK TO LIFE! :D\n\nConclusion: I don't regret buying Victor Vran.Satisfying fights and dark atmosphere make it a great experience.If you look for a new aRPG to spend some time with ,then it may be a good choice,especially if you have someone to play with, you'll surely enjoy it.","April 12","true","27.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I just grab everything.\nJoin some other dude's game and stalk the ♥♥♥♥ out of him and i have completed tons of treasure hunt and bounty quests. Got my first legendary weapon somewhere along the line which is a Scythe by the name Devish. Pretty damn cool stuff that allow a secondary scythe spinning in my whirlwind skill which increases AOE. Been using that till now ever since i got it.\n\nGot so addicted to this game due to its absolute amazing mechanics and effects despite having almost no players . Grab a mortar preferably Chimera which fires 3 mortars and start jumping around with 1 Sun card + 4 Moon cards attached and you know what I'm talking about :) ♥♥♥♥ just got flashy and yes i just mentioned JUMP and there's a mortar skill that blast you to the sky and impact on land LOL\n\nWield Chimera and Devish, (no hexes)\n- walk into Cauldron of Chaos - COMPLETE but its sure damn tough.\n- walk into Bottomless Pit - Reach round 7 Solo\n- walk into PVP - okay there really isn't any much pvp here due to super lack of players i just went there to pop some cherry including my own =p\n- and now its my turn to run around with 5 Hexes ON in random players game room for show off.\n\nNext legendary weapon, i got a freakin LIGHTSABER\nYES! A FREAKIN LIGHTSABER. Sounds so cool and look so cool deflecting stupid annoying birds projectile back at them and see them POP! LOL\n\nGot feddup with weak legendaries weapon - their damage is too low and fights took too long.\nTook a rare electric gun and upgrade the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. Transmute a daze effect on it at max damage of 169 (legendaries are only around 100 damage)\n\nThings was decent untill i got an awesome shotgun by the name Vera with burst shells apart from a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of legendary weapon that are seemingly useless. Bind my keys on my logitech mouse and feel OP like a pro. Upgrade everything including my outfit, Demon Power and having the right Destiny Cards combination.\nCleaning every maps with 5 Hexes ON.\nWalk into Cauldron of Chaos with full confidence - DEAD\nWalk into Bottomless Pit - DEAD on round 3 (ice mobs a sh^tload of them!)\n\n\nThings was still pretty tough untill i got a Lucky Rabbit Foot out of the blue just recently which grants 100% critical rate for 6 seconds. Combined it with a Barbarian card which refreshes all cooldown on full overcharge. Swap outfit and fully upgraded it to gain 300% overcharge on critical.\nGeared with Vera and Devish\n- Walk into Cauldron of Chaos - COMPLETE\n- Walk into Bottomless Pit - got straight to round 10 solo untill a baby spider ONE SHOT me. I have like 1000+ kills on that run.\nNOTE: Vera shines not because of its damage, instead the damage is pretty damn pathetic at this point of game. However it shines with its awesomely long range and burst shells that fills overcharge almost instantly (instant with rabbit foot) which allows demon power and pot spamming. Some people may even think I'm hacking or somesort lol.\n\nJust few days ago i got Spark - a legendary lightning gun\nSwapped Vera for Spark for fun and walk into Bottomless Pit with a few acquintants that uses lightning gun as well. I just spam lightning ball the whole time and they divert my ball for me and by the time we know it there is a sh^tload of lightning balls in the arena LOL. Occasionally its like a combined GIGA Lightning Ball of DOOM slaying everything in its path (including friendly :/ ) and we got to Round 12! Furthest i have reached thus far in the game. Anything at this point could just ONE SHOT me despite fully upgraded outfit and sadly all my teamates are gone/left at this point so i am the last to have fallen and GAME OVER.\n\nOverall i will add another point to this game for its 100+ hours of fun\n9/10 - will die again.\nHope to see more players and new contents soon.","April 19","true","139.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/101112131718/recommended/345180/","101112131718","DistraughtPompano","http://steamcommunity.com/id/101112131718/","360 products in account","I've played numeros ARPG's over the years... I started with Diablo 2, then played Diablo 3, Path of Exile, Torchlight II, and other games that are similar but somewhat different (magicks 1/2). I think Victor Vran is an amazing ARPG. The combat is extremely fluid and rich, reminding me of diablo 3. Where i felt Torchlight II was somewhat lackluster in combat and i got the feeling that i was just dps-kite and wait for mana-dps-kite and wait for mana, etc. I feel that Victor Vran completely eliminates that feeling.\n\nCombat: First of all, there is no mana bar in this game, at least traditionally. There is a yellow meter called the overdrive meter, which can be charged in various ways depending on your characters outfit (read: class), which can be changed throughout the game. The changing of the outfit throughout the game was nice because it made it so you didn't need to commit to anything and that your playstyle can adapt as you get gear better suited to one outfit or another. Anyway, the overdrive meter, as its called, is used to power your demon abilities. Like i said ealier, it can be charged in various ways depending on the outfite, but it is most generally charged by doing damage. This means that in dry periods with few enemies, you likely won't be using abilities, but when you got mobbed by bosses or ads, then the bar will fill up fast and you can start slamming those demon powers. This helps to eliminate one of my torchlight complains about mana.\n\nThe other wonderful thing about the combat is just how generally fluid it is. The game is perfectly optimized for a controller, as it isn't cluttered with 9 abilites on an action bar (which i know a lot of people may like as it necessarily provides options and niche abilities). There is also a built in dodge/roll key, as dodging is vital to staying alive. The weapons in this game, which of course define how your character's combat plays out, are nice as the skills tied to each weapon will generally build around itself for a neat playstyle. The tome (free dlc) for instance, produces gems with basic attacks that, when picked up, reset the cooldown to your other abilities. The scythe collects souls of enemies when you auto-attack, and the skills (a daze and whirl) became lengthened depending on how many souls you have when you used the skill. Combining all of these elements to the game creates a very mobile, action packed combat system that really shines.\n\nCustomization: In this game, there is not a lot of customization. In fact, there is nothing in this game that can't be undone at a whim, as all of the customizaion is simply what gear you have. That's right, there are no skill trees or speccable stats anywhere. I would normally be upset at this as i really like to build my own characters around a playstyle i want and make something somewhat unique. But, this is not a problem at all. The gear varies pretty typically in the game, but it is obvious that the game was not meant to be one where you make a full mage or rapier specialist. In this game, you play as Victor Vran, who can do everything, which makes it rather nice. As i mentioned earlier, you can switch playstles on a whim if you just pick up a new weapon you really like. If you have a crit build, for instance, and find a really nice hammer, then you can just flip over to a new outfit, throw in some new abilities, and you're suddely a viable hammer user. no strings attached.\n\nWith the gear in this game, there are a couple categories, with almost all of them being completely straightforward. The only one that isn't, is the destiny cards. When you level up you have a certain amount of points that can be allocated to your destiny cards. The destiny cards have a class type, such as "Strength" or "The Moon", which offer a special effect "higher crit chance" and "frost explostion on crit" respectively. They also have a point system to them, so the higher point value a card, the more powerful the effect is. There are a lot of different cards that range from more health, to life on kill, to crit chance, buff duration, damage at the cost of life etc. These effectively act as that traditional skill tree, offering all the passive buffs you could want. But, just like the rest of the stuff i've said, they can all be switched out on a whim and a whole new set of cards could be swapped in.\n\nPlot: The plot is relatively conservative, at least at first. Without going into spoilers, you play as Victor Vran, a hunter in the darken times with gargoyles, demons, vampires, skeletons and the likes. You got a message from an old friend, Adrian, calling you out to the city of Zagoravia, which is teeming with demon influence and is a deathtrap to hunters, like yourself. When you arrive you find a few survivors still holding on in a tower keep, which include your merchants and the queen. It is your mission to find out your friend and slay some baddies along the way.\n\nHexes: Before i finish, i just wanted to mention one thing in this game called a hex. There are five hexes which act as modifiers on the game and can generally be toggled on and off depending on what mode you are playing. (in hard mode the hexes can't be turned off). The modifiers make the game more difficult and will do things such as give enemies regen, or just randomly damage your character, but playing with them on also increases your experience and gold, i think. I just thought this was worth mentioning, since it gives seasoned ARPG veterans an interesting challenge to throw in the mix of the usual affairs.","May 22","true","14.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The ability to transmute items harkens back to D2's Horadric Cube, being able to reroll stats on weapons, improve the quality, or just transmuting a bunch of greens and getting a couple uniques out of it.\n\nThe challenges for each level, while optional, provide another level of depth to the game that rewards challenging your style of gameplay, and also increases replayability of areas.\n\nHexes are a cool way to turn difficulty up and down and be rewarded for playing more skillfully.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hardlywalken/recommended/345180/","hardlywalken","HardlyWalken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hardlywalken/","385 products in account","Wow! I gave this game the cold shoulder due to the silly title and late Playstation 2-level graphics. Picked it up on sale and can say unequivocably: Huge mistake to not jump on this immediately. This is one of the best, most daring ARPGs ever made, full of original ideas and excellent game design.\n\nThe first thing I liked: This is a much more skill-based ARPG than a clickfest. It expects you to work on your facing, dodging, and using terrain and abilities appropriately. The monsters have wind-ups and tells on all their attacks and so positioning and paying attention is important. You will have abundant potions but they are on a LONG cooldown so you can't chug your way through fights. Don't get me wrong - this is not Dark Souls but compared to ARPGs where you basically walk through your skill cooldowns and watch everything die it's a big step up.\n\nSecond thing I liked: not a bunch of fake choices. When you have a decision to make, it's a real decision between very different choices. Very rarely are you making weenie choices about +3% extra damage stuff. Your passive skills are collectible Tarot-like cards that drop in the world or are rewarded on level up and they all have very different effects. You slot them up and have a quota that you can't exceed.  You also have a sort of mana bar called Overdrive that fills up in different ways based on the kind of clothes you wear (it makes sense in the game, kinda) and once it is full you can use it to unleash a powerful kind of attack or magical effect (meteors from the sky, a time distortion bubble that slows enemies) - and the different kinds of effects are also cards that drop in the environment.  You also have one alchemy slot that you can fill with either a very offensive or very defensive bonus. There's also a gambling system that makes every item, including the trash drops, potentially valuable.  It's interesting and very, very solid.\n\nThird, no bad skill trees that force me to guess-commit to builds based on a couple levels worth of scaling and some ambiguously-worded tooltips. Your "builds" are based on your weapon choice - the weapons are little skill trees that you carry around. Each weapon has a basic attack + 2 skills on cooldowns, and you get to carry two of them that you can switch between freely. Pick up a new kind of weapon? You can equip it and try it out to check out its skills, and see how it works fo your character. You might want to do Sword + Shotgun for decent single target + crowd control at both ranged and melee. Or you can go completely nuts and do Hammer + Lighting Gun, basically a heavy hitter that carpet-bombs areas and zaps bosses from across the screen when the going gets tough. Or whatever. It's a great system and is IMMENSLY satisying. You get to try all the options, make your own combos and play with a character that you enjoy and made an informed decision about constructing after weighing all the options through actual play.\n\nFourth, very good scaling difficulty system. The base game is fairly easy but starting around level 9 you can equip Hexes. These are cursed items and you can equip as many as you want, and they make the game harder in specific ways. Monsters start doing more damage, attacking more, and just generally being big PITAs. If you start getting your face wrecked or struggle with a particular boss (respawning resets the boss fights) then turn off a couple of the dang Hexes. Just know in your heart you cheesed it. ;)\n\nFifth, a challenge system. When you enter a new area you get a list of challenges. There are some pretty basic ones, like "Find all 3 secrets". Ok, sure. But some are really good, like forcing you to rush killing 40 monsters in 60 seconds (basically you're going to wade into a huge melee and start wrecking the place) and real tough ones like killing everything in the level without getting hit, or using the "wrong" tactics to fight certain monsters (fighting big stone golems that hit really hard in melee is tough!) If you manage to beat these challenges you get rewards of items, XP, and gold, and also little gold stars on the game's map. I had a blast with these, they added a nice wrinkle to the game and a reason to come back and replay some of the levels.\n\nNow it's not a perfect game.  As I stated earlier the graphics are not great although they are 100% acceptable and communicate game information clearly (there's also a couple of nice moments). The story is kinda weak and I stopped gving a hoot after a couple hours. For some inexplicable reason they used the voice actor of Geralt of Rivia from the Witcher games for Victor so I feel like I'm playing the adventures of Geralt Van Helsing. And lastly there's no way to get a DPS comparison count on the weapons, so when you've locked in your build and started comparing and tweaking drops it gets a little tedious to have to eyeball 8 swords to figure out which one is the best.\n\nBut overall this is a great ARPG and absolutely worth every penny of the full price. I hope you'll give it a chance. I'm glad I did.","January 5","true","6.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Multihack/recommended/345180/","Multihack","Multihack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Multihack/","200 products in account","Short version: This game is well worth the money. It's an action packed Co-Op which will make you question the reasoning behind the prices of other ARPGs out there.\n\nPros:\n\nPrice - yes really, you're getting a LOT of game for this price. It could easily charge £20+/32$ for what it is. Being so cheap is definitely a BIG plus.\nThe physics behind all the level jumping involved are executed very well.\nTheme: I suspect the studio is based in Easter Europe, and we're lucky that they decided to go with native culture for the characters in V.V. I have never been happier to see an orthodox priest!\nHumour - Lots of referencing and joking. It's a light hearted title that doesn't take itself too seriously.\nMechanics - a new, refreshing take on how to "customise" your character via the Tarot cards.\nFully voiced narrative! - I can forgive the small budget "rogue-like" games out there that you have to read through a lot. However every decent RPG should be at least 90% voiced. I find reading from a screen, often in a 'thematic' font, to be tedious work.\nGood Guy developers - yes this is a pro, I would mention it again if I could. The devs have promised to release several DLC's for FREE. For a game this cheap?! Take a look at Tropico 5 page if you want to see what the opposite of that is.\nTreasure hunting - occassionally you'd get a map that requires you to revisit some place to fight a more beefed up boss. It's a nice touch.\n\n\n\n\nCons:\nContent: At this stage there's too little depth in the actual customisation. After 6 or so hours you're likely to have found most if not all the range of weapons (not find all uniques, but find all variants).\nI would really like to see a new item slot with the same depth as the stuff we've been getting for guns or Tarot cards.\nStory & characters - I have to admit they're all pretty forgettable and insignifficant, except for You and the secret voice in your head. I feel like it's worth mentioning as a con, but what is also worth mentioning that an original story is almost impossible at this stage, certainly if you pick a classic theme.\nDifficulty - Simply the game is too easy! "Hard" mode  is what I would call default. It can be very challenging, sure, but I wish it was kicking my ♥♥♥. You can respawn in the same dungeon without losing progress, exp, or money. That's not very hard is it?\n\n\nMy verdict:\nFor the price you can't beat it. This is a game made by people who love to make games, not money. For that reason alone and if it sounds like something you'd enjoy, You should buy it!\n\nFor the game to be a "must buy" I would suggest it should include either:\n\nMore weapons/item customisation. You can't really call it a co-op without there being some sort of healing class, can you?\nOR\nMore creative boss fights. If the devs read this review take note of RIFT. That game changed the MMO genre the way DAoC did. But what I'm talking about is that every boss fight in Rift from the very first dungeon was: 1. voiced and 2. required a unique strategy to defeat.\n\nPromice me #2 in a DLC or expansion, devs and you will become legendary.","July 26, 2015","true","32.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

My wife and I only turned on the Tyrant/Champion hex and the difficulty felt perfect.  Nice thing is it isn't just a blind increase in difficulty, you get increased experience/items appropriately.\n\nThe game also has an objective/optional objective based star system that honestly reminds me of Mario 64 when you look at the world map.  The nice thing is every time you complete an objective you either get a boost of experience or money.

There's nothing awful about it. The graphics are nice enough, the music has a nice sound, and it has what looks like some decent controller support. You can play with a mouse, but the game really feels like it was meant to be played with a controller instead. Unfortunately, I was playing with a mouse.\n\nThe game is voice acted, and the voice acting is pretty nice, and the loot seems okay, though not as deep as most ARPG fanatics would likely desire. The game's jumping controls while in a hedge maze were rather laughable while using a mouse only, but it isn't a huge complaint. In short, the game's alright. It might even be "good." I just don't feel compelled to stick with it. If you're absolutely dying for more ARPGs in the Diablo vein, you could play this if you've ran out of the best alternatives I've found, such as The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing series and the Torchlight series, and other fan favorites. So it's not a bad game from what I've seen; just not something that thrilled me, and unless you have a controller, it'll feel a bit wonky at times.","April 10","false","1.3"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","3"

An interesting story and lots of challenges with enough variety to keep you going. A great indie game hack n slash.\n\nGood job devs.","July 25, 2015","true","14.1"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

I was looking for a good ARPG at that time to replace Diablo 3 and Path of Exile, as I had played them till utter boredom. Several games, indie and professional alike, had disappointed me, however, Victor Vran did not.\nYou play as Victor Vran, the titular demon hunter, on his quest to free the city of Zagoravia from a demon invasion. You don't need much more story in an ARPG, and the first versions of Early Access didn't even have that - the quest givers were basically the developers talking to you. The current version has the fill story, which is fine by ARPG standards, but nothing to write home about otherwise.\nYou can play with gamepad or different keyboard/mouse configurations, I personally like the gamepad controls the best - they are fluent and support the action-oriented gameplay with dodging and a fully-rotatable camera.\nTo kill stuff (which after all is the prime activity in any good ARPG), you can pick form a variety of melee and ranged weapons (swords, hammers, rapiers, shotguns, mortars and lightning guns at this time). Each weapon time has one basic and two special attacks, which males for interesting synergies in combination with magical properties (up to two per weapon).\nCharacter development does NOT work with a skill tree, but by choosing weapons, demon powers (spells you can cast once your overdrive meter is full; it fills by dealing damage) and Destiny Cards. The latter are items you put in slots that are awarded by leveling up and grant various buffs.\nThe graphics are fine for on ARPG (don't expect photorealism) and a bit on the bright side palette-wise. The music sounds nice, I think it's a bit above the average ambient "music" of many current RPGs.\nIs it fun? Hell yeah, it is! If you're looking for some fun, fast-paced monster-slaying, grab it. However,  if you're looking for an "MMO" ARPG in the line of Diablo 3 and PoE, with trading and ladders, check out some videos before, it might not be what you crave.","July 25, 2015","true","26.4"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

There is a multitude of weapons, melee and ranged, to be found and used, all customizable in the form of prefix and suffix-type enchantments through the Transmutation feature. Adding to this is your card deck which you fill with Destiny cards (like tarot cards) that drop from enemies and chests, each of which grant a perk. Then you have Demon powers which are special abilities that can be summoned off a charge meter. Putting all of these together, the character customization possibilities are pretty much endless. There are no classes in Victor Vran. Your loadout is your class. And oh yes before I forget, YOU CAN JUMP AND DODGE!\n\nThe game is graphically beautiful and the environments well designed. It runs smoothly on Ultra settings at 60fps on my rig, an i5-4690k and Radeon R9 280 with shadows disabled (shadows on creates fps lag, idk why). Controls are intuitive and get easier the more you play.\n\nStory-wise (which is forgettable; you're basically there to clean up someone else's mess), the game takes about 2-3 hours to complete if you're not a completionist and don't care for dungeon challenges and secrets. If you do, it'll bump that up to maybe 10 - 15 hours.

Just completed the first boss of the game and have a few things to say.\n\nFirst of all, graphics and voice acting are awesome, Victor's voice is just so right for his character, although "Voice" get's a little annoying from time to time, he's pretty funny (like calling me a cheater when I jumped in the maze.)\n\nGameplay's pretty smooth, a nice breath of air to most RPG's where it's point, click, wait, repeat. The active combat, move cancleing and dodging are all very well done, slight gripe to be had on the dodge's I-frames (if it has any) but I put that down to me being used to Devil May Cry games. The ability to switch between two equipped weapons on the fly is awsome as well, although I wish we had the option to exchange that second slot for Dual Weilding (hint hint)\n\nNow for a couple of personal gripes. All of which have to do with the Wraith type enemies encountered, most noticibly, the blue one. Either I'm stupid and am missing a huge cue they're about to do their rush or you need freaking future-sight to dodge those things. Secondly, a certain kind of challange is begining to grate on my nerves a bit; the "slay X enemies without taking damage" challenge. By itself, it's a hard challenge of which I'd have no quaral if I didn't have to restart the entire area if I screw it up! I'm going to say this is also going to crop up in later dungeons with "Slay X without using potions" or "slay X without using Demon Powers". I'm not dissing the challenges, gotta have them their for the extra fun and bragging rights, but why can't the counter just reset upon failing the condition rather then forcing a complete restart if you want to get it? It doesn't help the the first time you get this challenge, you're very quickly greeted by one of the afformentioned Blue Wraiths who wiped out any chance of that on my first dodge. The "Slay without using potions or demon powers" in one of the later dungeons in zone 1 cut it close too, had to resort to some huge shotgun cheesing to complete the task without dying so I could use a potion.\n\nI get the feeling these gripes of mine will dissappear as my skill at the game gets better, as said, played up until after killing the first boss of the game (who was a very fun fight by the way, only needed one statue although it got a bit dicey when he started summoning 3 totoms at once) and loved pretty much all of it bar those niggles, Looking forward to the DLC!","November 5, 2015","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a really fun game with some strategic depth to it. The narrator reminded me of Bastion, at times. You sort of build a ... bond with the treacherous git.\n\nUnlike other games of its kind, the character path is not determined by characters' skill but through a combination of demon power talismans, destiniy cards and the suit he wears. You can make minute changes to each one to suit your needs at the moment. Leveling up only changes how many destiny points you can have on your deck so there is still a difference between a low level and a high level character but the mechanism is ingenious.\n\nThen there is the bounty/treasure map mechanic. Everyonce in a while you will get a bounty or a treasure map which requires you to visit old haunts for new loot and monsters to fight. You can share and use other players' bounties as well (there is a forum thread for this purpose).

And this one is actually good. I don`t know. I guess this game just checks all the boxes. Fun gameplay, engaging plot, actually interesting boss battles, and it even has a lot of interesting new ideas. I never said `oh, if they only did this it would be so much better` that is common with so many of these types of games (except for not rotating the minimap by default). This is the game Torchlight 2 should have been. Although I did encounter an issue where vsync (enabled by default) made the game incredibly stuttery. And things aren`t explained well; I had to go to the settings just to find out how to change between equipped weapons. But it`s really fun to play. There are multiple references some of which I`m pretty sure I didn`t get. And there are gangnam style zombies.

Basic powers come from the 8 weapon types, not classes (there are no classes). Additional powers come from 2 slotted consumables (of 12) and 2 slotted Demon Powers (of 10?). Additionally passive abilities come from destiny cards, 5 slots of lots and lots. The remaining slot is a costume slot, which can be core to your build.\n\nSome nice features such as seemingly unlimited inventory space and straightforward upgrade paths (no RNG in the gear upgrade system) make this a single character game with maximum tweaking and rebuilding potential.\n\nCombat is good fun and can be spectacular, though in large zones frame rate problems are genuinely serious and do detract from the experience.\n\nOne great system is hexes which allow you to tweak the challenge level very precisely beyond the basic difficulty modes as presented. This allows you to manage the difficulty of each encounter if you wish. Load all 5 hexes for maximum difficulty or just 1 if you want just a bit more challenge. In game challenge modes prompt you to try different hexes on individual maps.\n\n8/10","May 1","true","59.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Don't take me wrong, the game is fantastic and it is both worth it's price and it is totally worth checking out for the reason previously stated, and that's whether you're a diehard fan of hack'n'slash genre or just a casual looking for a fun combat system, yet there are a few aspects I subjectively think could use improving:\n\n1. No trade option nor a 'trade house' - Since Legendary weapons are very hard to reliably drop and most of the times they're totally random, you can walk through the game ending up with either a good amount of Legendaries or next to none whatsoever, and that's without counting that you may both have almost every single type dropped or just a few copies of the same weapon all over again, which is a bit frustrating if you're not a fan of ceaseless grinding, especially for players new to the game. Since Legendaries are among the most fun weapons in the game, not to mention many of their special abilities actually change the playstyle of a given weapon type, a simple Trade option would keep the new players interested in the game instead of being bored to death because of endless gray/green/gold drops all over again, while more experienced players would have the option of sharing or trading the numerous copies of the same Legendaries (that they wouldn't make use of anyway) with their friends.\n\n\n2. Bounty/Hunt drops are far too few - Yes, I get the idea that they're kept low to encourage the community to work together and share their codes, but given that it's hard to find players online nowadays turns this approach obsolete. Since the endgame consists of challenges (which, once completed, aren't there anymore), bottomless pit runs (which, given the low amount of drops, are in my opinion just a test ground for trying out new playstyles against waves of enemies) and the dreaded cauldron of chaos (kudos for the implementation, more of that please!), the better or simply more reliable drop rate of Bounties and Treasure Hunts tied to some specific activity would keep more players interested in the game and give them something to do each day.\n\n3. Endgame content comes down to Cauldron of Chaos mostly - The implementation of CoC was a perfect move from the developers, as it is essentially a damn hard challenge for players that changes every day, keeping them interested in the game and providing them with some meaningful tests to try their builds and skill. My point here is therefore not against the CoC itself, which is awesome, but because that it's the only meaningful endgame level that has some daily significance and appropriate rewards. The simple idea is that the game could really use more instances like this so that playerbase keeps growing.\n\n4. Victor Vran II? - The point is more of a personal comment from me, so don't take it as an objective argument. As I said, the game brings lots of freshness to the stale hack'n'slash genre and I love the changes to the formula that the devs have implemented. My only wish is that they further expand upon this solid idea basis and try releasing a proper old-school expansion or perhaps another installment for Victor Vran, giving players more of everything - a bigger world, more ever-changing endgame instances, more unique weapon types, more card types, more outfits, more powers, perhaps even a customization of one's own hunter instead of playing as Victor Vran himself. The brilliant basis is already there in VV, so I really hope the devs take it further and give players striving for freshness in the ARPGs more of new stuff to sink their teeth in.\n\nA solid 9/10 from me.","April 5","true","289.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play as Victor Vran - no matter what style of character you intend to make. There are no skill trees or tranditional point sytems.  When you level up, you get a pre-set bonus and then one of 3 items.\n\nThe variety in the gameplay comes with the fact that attacks and specials are linked to what type of weapon you have. Each weapon type has 3 attacks.  On top of that, you have charge attack specials, which are loot-based specials that are triggerable when a meter is full (it fills up when you attack stuff).\n\nOne other point of interest is that the game is split into actual levels. Each level has challanges associated with it if you choose.\n\nPros:\n- Play whatever style you like. The ability to use anything is nice.\n- Challenges will keep you coming back (and post-game loot hunting).\n- A good challenge solo without being impossible.\n- Multiplayer is implemented well. Start as lobby that anyone can join.\n\nCons:\n- Not many, honestly.

People are comparing it to Diablo II and Path of Exile but this game is it's own different breed entirely. Instead of generic level based skills, you have two weapons each with three different skills apiece. Being able to switch weapons on the fly, this proves pretty handy in certain scenarios. You also have "destiny cards" that you equip to act as your passive abilities. Then you have your demonic powers that at level fourteen, you can equip two that act as your ultimate attacks. Demonic powers are also cards that you equip just like the destiny cards. I've been strictly playing with my mouse but apparently both the keyboard "Action" setting and the gamepad controls are great. The game is indeed an action role playing game but I wouldn't necessarily compare it to Diablo II or PoE but more akin to Gauntlet than anything else. The combat is excellent and satisfying. The only problem I have is the lack of armor. You strictly have outfits that you equipment for certain bonuses that change your style of gameplay. Overall with the few hours I've put into the game, it is excellent and I would recommend it.","July 25, 2015","true","2.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Looking for a basic ARPG to play with my non-gamer wife, we ran across this one. We'd just finished up the Van Helsing set (buggy but fun). We just started playing it and are just at the lower levels but we love it so far. The cartoon cut scenes remind me of old Legend of Kryandia somehow but it's got a catchy nostalgia to it. You get a little more freedom of movement than most similar titles which is nice. Seems like less spell tree development but a lot more weapon type choices and corresponding special moves and animations plus all sorts of enhancement cards, potions and charge up demon spells. You can't not love the flying hammer smash + explosion animation--it causes maniacal laughter. I don't know if this is found elsewhere but one cool thing in the gameplay is specific challenges within the main quest. Kill this many things with a sword, don't use potions, find this many secret locations, etc. So, you're not just mindlessly hacking and slashing with the biggest weapons you can find. Definite thumbs up on first impressions.","February 18","true","98.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pyronix/recommended/345180/","pyronix","Pyronix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pyronix/","99 products in account","TLDR: A must buy game.\n\nI have played Diablos 1 through 3, Torchlight 1 and 2, Path of Exile, Marvel Heroes and Divinity... Having said that, I think Victor Vran has reached peak perfection on the ARPG genre. This is the game you should not think twice of picking up. I was hesistant at first since I wasn't an early access buyer and just decided to buy the game based on all of the good reviews on Steam (and youtube gameplay videos). I bought one for myself and for my brother and we have never looked back.\n\nPROS:\n- Very fluid gameplay and great graphics. Keeping things fascinating is the ability to jump, and dodge, and so on\n- Can downscale graphics to be playable on low-end desktops/laptops\n- Decent story with great voice acting (much much much better story than Diablo 3/Torchlight 2)\n- A bit steampunk (enough to please fans of the genre, but not too much to turn off non-fans of steampunk).\n- The setting and ambiance of the story and game - old eastern European "Transylvannia" - is very much on point\n- You can change your difficulty almost on the fly with hexes - plus the difficulty setting is so innovatively done (again, not like D3 where higher difficulty settings just give more health, toughness and power to mobs)\n- The outfit you wear essentially determines majority of your playstyle. However, the system is easy to understand but at the same time is intricate and deep. No skill trees here - but how they implemented choice is wonderfully done. Your outfit, weapons, demon powers, and destiny cards determine your "class", and there are possibly a billion combination of these\n- A lot of people seemingly hate "The Voice" character but I love him. A lot of el-oh-el references and funny quips abound\n\nCONS:\n- still some bugs that need to be ironed out. Some champion mobs don't reset from rage mode when you die even though their hitpoints goes back to full. Also there are areas where when you make the mistake of stepping on them the whole screen freezes (but the UI is still active, strangely). happens rarely though.\n- online coop mode works but can be confusing. It turns out that you can only be friends in-game with folk you are Steam friends with. Also, the UI needs to be worked on to show you if you are already in a party or night as there is no confirmation if you want to join a friend's party when he/she invites you. The game should immediately port you to your friends' instance when you join\n\nMINOR GRIPES:\n- no playable female characters (which doesn't matter to me as I'm a guy and I like playing guy characters but putting it here for gender equality - they should make an Irene costume or skin)\n- should have a costume/skin system\n- more addicting than crack :(\n\nWill still rate the game 10/10.","July 25, 2015","true","175.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

If you've ever played Diablo 3 or torchlight 2, Any rpg and thought I wish there was a higher skill ceiling for normal fights not just bosses. Where dodging is not a passive move. Then play this game its fantastic. it adds jumping rolling and incredibly dynamic fighting to the standard arp play by using wasd to move around.\n\nIntuitive and fun though much harder then most arpgs. I keep being told with newer coop and mmos. Well the games easy but only for the first 200 hours then you'll finally hit the hard part... O.O... Waiting until endgame to actually need to play has killed so many games for me. When 5 percent of your content needs more then 3 buttons then 95 percent of your players are going to fall asleep.\n\nThis one fixes it with a hex system ((turn on and off buffs to the monsters at will))\n\nOther then that heres the setup. two weapons switch between them at will each with their own left click attack e and q ((drastically different effects from crowd control to self buffs)) on top of that two powers which require a seperate resource to use no cooldown on them though. Then you have cards which add passive though sometimes dramatic changes to gameplay.\n\nOne thing! if you want to use cool looking powers spells what have you then make sure to pick the top hat costume it gives focus ((for casting those moves)) All the time instead of on hit etc. Makes it much easier to manage. But lower armor to compensate.\n\nThats the one caveat two actually no chracter customization as far as cosmetics other then costumes.\n\n\n9.5 out of ten.

You have a dodge button, a jump button, 3 weapon attacks, and a powerful ability called an Overdrive that gradually charges as you deal or take damage. Movement and abilities are responsive and fluid, there's even a wall jump mechanic. Areas offer secrets to be found, and challenges to be completed. And you will of course level up, gain new abilities, acquire powerful equipment, what's not to like?\n\nAs it turns out, quite a bit. Because apart from the relatively polished gameplay, there are cut corners on nearly every other aspect of the game. Victor Vran had such POTENTIAL, which was unfortunately squandered by either a limited budget or a lack of vision.\n\nTo begin, when you go to your home base the first time, it's pretty sparse, but still you think: "Wow, this is probably going to get a whole bunch of other people offering cool items, crafting and spells over the course of the game!" But then 10 hours later, you've nearly beaten the game and none of that ever happened. Transmutation(oooh!) unlocks at Level 16, and then you discover Transmutation is just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ crafting system to increase damage or critical chance on your weapons. Or you can forget about it entirely and just wait a few levels and get a better weapon from drops. That works too.\n\nThe combat is great fun at first. It's awesome blasting skeletons with a shotgun for the first hour or so, but then you expect the combat to evolve in some way, but it never does. 7 weapons in the game, each with 3 moves. The same 3 moves you use when you get your first Scythe are the same 3 moves you'll be using at Level 50.\n\nAreas offer secrets to be found, but those secrets are merely gold or a random weapon.\n\nMonster variety is limited. Spiders, skeletons, wraiths, rifle skeletons, hammer skeletons, elementals are the majority of what you fight. Areas consist of gardens, caves, crypts, cemeteries, city streets, and houses. Mix and match area and enemy types as you see fit! Perhaps a garden with spiders, skeletons and wraiths. Or a cave with spiders. Or a house with gargoyles, skeletons and wraiths. Or an open plain with skeletons, spiders and elementals.\n\nThe theme of this game is literally: What you see is what you get. Nothing of substance ever changes in this game to keep you truly interested. You level up at first and can use 2 weapons. Cool. Then you level up and can use 2 potions.  Ok. Then you level up and can use 2 Overdrives. And that's the extent of the leveling system. Every time you level up after that you get more health or Destiny Points so you can equip Destiny Cards, which are just more stat padding. There is no real, meaty customization to be found here.\n\nThe characters are lifeless. The story is forgettable. On a better note, Victor has a voice inside his head who makes wise cracks about things from time to time, and he was funny enough to make me laugh several times.\n\nIf I were to express my biggest issue with this game, it's that we should be playing its sequel right now. Victor Vran has laid down a decent foundation which could be massively improved to great success. Unfortunately, that is not the case. As it is, Victor Vran is not worth more than 2 hours of your time, and no more than $5 of your money.","July 27, 2015","false","10.9"," 15 of 30 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","15","30","0","3"

Being able to dodge and roll adds the feeling of complete control over the encounter situation. Though, it is a hack and slash ARPG, you still have the flexibility to choose how to go about an encounter.\n\nWeapons determine which set of abilities you have. Each weapon comes with a basic attack and 2 specials attacks. Each unique within themselves, pressing you to be more tactful in your decisions. You can equip 2 weapons at one time. For example, you can carry a Shotgun with a Rapier. Allowing you begin the encounter ranged and then dashing in to strike quick and devasting blows. Switching between weapons is situation dependant and personal choice. It is, however, needed in order to progress with harder difficulty settings.\n\nThe four weapon choices are: Sword, Hammer, Shotgun, and Rapier.\n\nDemon Power is nothing new to ARPG MMOs, in this game you will eventually (once you increase in level) be able to equip 2 separate demon powers.\n\nMaps and Difficulties:\nThe maps range in size, just as any other ARPG. Where this game separates itself most from others like it, is the ability to jump. Jumping allows for you to reach heights where secret treasures await you. The current available maps environments range from inside a castle of Skeletons, outside in a spider infested courtyard, to deep into the bowels of an earth encrusted dungeon. Each sharing similar mobs as well as having their own unique sets of encounters.\n\nThe difficulty of the game is set by you at anytime. The hex system is quite enjoyable, you control a packs buffs and if you want more champions or less. Maybe you are farming for gold, so turn on the hex for gold drop increased. If you are farming for gear, turn on the appropriate hexes and start hacking away on any map you choose. Too hard, then turn off a hex or two until you find your comfort zone.\n\nCharacter progression, gear, and cards:\nAs you level your character to level 10 (current max level) you will unlock more weapon, cards, and demon power slots. This is where the customization comes into play.\n\nCards boost your stats and more importantly can cripple or complement your build. So, choose wisely as a bad setup could leave you crippled on the battlefield.\n\nFarming is part of any ARPG just as much as this one, this game is not for everyone. In order to progress to be able to stack your Hexes, you will need to farm for better gear, cards, weapons, and demon powers. Its a question of will you enjoy it.\n\nMaps Challenges:\nEach map has its own set of challenges. So, when you are 68/70 mobs killed without taking any damage and you get hit, you will have to start that challenge over. The positive side is that there are several challenges per map, so if you lose one, you may gain another. Allowing for you to complete that map and come back at a later time, better equipped and with a vengance.\n\nOverall Opinion:\nVictor Van.... Van Helsing.... not sure if its a ripoff or a parody of the other. Probably should have given a different name to the game, something more genarlized and not focused on a characters name. This would allow for the choice of Female or Male character.\n\nPositives:\nGameplay is smooth and combat is enjoyable. The various amount of maps are fun to play and with the challenges and hex system, there are hours of gameplay to be had.\n\nThe background of the game is colorful and easy on the eyes. Making for some good scenery along your adventures.\n\nNegatives:\nThe storyline dialogue and voice over is not yet in game, which puts me in a position where I am unable to play for countless hours on end. Not having the storyline, the only thing to do from start to finish is complete the challenges and the first set of quests. Do not expect to get lost in a story when it is not there yet.\n\nThe multiplayer is not yet active, so dont be fooled by the advertisement. It is content yet to come.\n\nShould I buy it?\nI would suggest buying the early access, since it is currently on sale. Some will get exactly what they pay for while the others will get more out of it. If you want something else to play that is new and inexpensive, buy it.","February 21, 2015","true","28.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Being able to dodge and roll adds the feeling of complete control over the encounter situation. Though, it is a hack and slash ARPG, you still have the flexibility to choose how to go about an encounter.\n\nWeapons determine which set of abilities you have. Each weapon comes with a basic attack and 2 specials attacks. Each unique within themselves, pressing you to be more tactful in your decisions. You can equip 2 weapons at one time. For example, you can carry a Shotgun with a Rapier. Allowing you begin the encounter ranged and then dashing in to strike quick and devasting blows. Switching between weapons is situation dependant and personal choice. It is, however, needed in order to progress with harder difficulty settings.\n\nThe four weapon choices are: Sword, Hammer, Shotgun, and Rapier.\n\nDemon Power is nothing new to ARPG MMOs, in this game you will eventually (once you increase in level) be able to equip 2 separate demon powers.\n\nMaps and Difficulties:\nThe maps range in size, just as any other ARPG.

For nearly 7 bucks I gave it a try and .. love it.\n\nIt's different to other Hack'n Slays like D3, because you have alot of variety how to build your\ncharacter (destiny cards in various quality and rarity with cool effects, the costume which gives\nyou a bare 'layout' of your hero, in other games that would be close to "hero class").\n\nIn addition I like the combat system. Every weapon-type has its unique skills (basically 3 of each)\nand so its own tactics. Timing your attacks right and rotate depending on the situation is very nice.\n"The voice" brings alot of fun in Victor Vran, when playing through the story, which is underlined with\nneat artworks and speech. Challenging bossfights and a huge amount of different enemies with\nunique abilities and adjustable difficulty-options (called curses) are additional reasons,\nwhy the game won't become boring.\n\nFor me, Victor Vran is surprisingly good.

If you've ever played Diablo 3 or torchlight 2, Any rpg and thought I wish there was a higher skill ceiling for normal fights not just bosses. Where dodging is not a passive move. Then play this game its fantastic. it adds jumping rolling and incredibly dynamic fighting to the standard arp play by using wasd to move around.\n\nIntuitive and fun though much harder then most arpgs. I keep being told with newer coop and mmos. Well the games easy but only for the first 200 hours then you'll finally hit the hard part... O.O... Waiting until endgame to actually need to play has killed so many games for me. When 5 percent of your content needs more then 3 buttons then 95 percent of your players are going to fall asleep.\n\nThis one fixes it with a hex system ((turn on and off buffs to the monsters at will))\n\nOther then that heres the setup. two weapons switch between them at will each with their own left click attack e and q ((drastically different effects from crowd control to self buffs)) on top of that two powers which require a seperate resource to use no cooldown on them though. Then you have cards which add passive though sometimes dramatic changes to gameplay.\n\nOne thing! if you want to use cool looking powers spells what have you then make sure to pick the top hat costume it gives focus ((for casting those moves)) All the time instead of on hit etc. Makes it much easier to manage. But lower armor to compensate.\n\nThats the one caveat two actually no chracter customization as far as cosmetics other then costumes.\n\n\n9.5 out of ten.

Combat, then, is actually quite draining as most encounters feature tough-skinned foes that dish out plenty of damage and keep you moving. I died quite a few times on the normal setting, and I never activated any of "hexes" that are like handicaps that aren't in your favor. There's also plenty to do as every small dungeon has a list of around five optional challenges, with an extra set that will be unlocked after the completion of the main campaign.\n\nThe graphics in Victor Vran are pretty to say the least with good textures and plenty of detail. Even my GTX 770 has a hard time keeping up in most cases and only goes up to 72, while hovering around 48 in a lot of places.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to anybody looking for a challenging ARPG. Those looking for a casual experience will also find plenty to do to satisfy the asking price. If it's ever on sale, buy it up quick!\n\nFor more details, check out my video review below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyfHlPr8RnM","February 22","true","15.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Combat, then, is actually quite draining as most encounters feature tough-skinned foes that dish out plenty of damage and keep you moving. I died quite a few times on the normal setting, and I never activated any of "hexes" that are like handicaps that aren't in your favor. There's also plenty to do as every small dungeon has a list of around five optional challenges, with an extra set that will be unlocked after the completion of the main campaign.\n\nThe graphics in Victor Vran are pretty to say the least with good textures and plenty of detail. Even my GTX 770 has a hard time keeping up in most cases and only goes up to 72, while hovering around 48 in a lot of places.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to anybody looking for a challenging ARPG. Those looking for a casual experience will also find plenty to do to satisfy the asking price. If it's ever on sale, buy it up quick!\n\nFor more details, check out my video review below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyfHlPr8RnM","February 22","true","15.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Bought the 2-pack on sale to try it with a friend of mine since we both thought it looked good. It was. For awhile.\n\nBefore I begin, I only put in about 5~6 hours into this game before deciding I probably won't be revisiting it. As such, I'm only going to be able to review what I experienced.\n\nWeapons There's lots of weapon types in Victor Vran. All of them have a basic attack, and two special attacks. Some weapon types, like the Hand Mortar, are a bit more complex in how they work. The Hand Mortar allows you to hold down the button in order to charge/"aim" where your bomb will go, which lets players rapid fire super close range if they choose to, or safely arc bombs a long distance to attack monsters. I'm going over Hand Mortars because they're the main weapon that stuck out to me when I was playing. 90% of the fun I had playing Victor Vran was using a Hand Mortar. All other weapons were incredibly simple to use, and got boring after maybe 30 minutes of playing them.\n\nCombat  Consider this a sub-section to Weapons. Most enemies, with the exception of super baby enemies that attack you in groups of 20 and all die in one hit, have fairly obvious tells for their attacks, and the game puts a lot of emphasis on you being able to dodge these attacks. Victor Vran is a game that tries to be an ARPG and a hack 'n' slash at the same time, but it doesn't really work. Combat feels very mundane and basic, because what you can do in terms of attacks is very limited. "Hack 'N' Slash" is a pretty good description, considering that's basically all you can do. A lot of enemies either go down super easily, or last forever and only have maybe two attacks that you have to dodge. Fighting one strong enemy should feel engaging, but in Victor Vran it doesn't. But why doesn't it? The answer lies in the fact that again, Victor Vran is a Hack 'N' Slash built as an ARPG. I'll go a little bit more into that...\n\nMovement and Exploration here. In Victor Vran, you can dodge roll and jump. You can use either of these maneuvers to cancel out of a weapon's basic attack and move away, which means that at the first sight of danger, no matter what weapon you're using, you're able to safely get out (most of the time) and wait for another chance to engage. Let's talk about jumping for a second. The land of Victor Vran is littered with treasure chests that are "hidden." How are they hidden? Well, two ways typically. Jumping somewhere/onto a platform that vaguely looks like you can maybe jump on it, or walljumping in an incredibly specific way. Jumping ultimately is nothing more than a convenience feature at times when traversing areas, and a "puzzle solving mecahnic," if you want to call it that. You can also jump and then jump again to slam down and disperse enemies, but this is rarely useful, and given the AoE-ness of a lot of weapons it's usually a bad thing. A lot of attacks that look like they can be avoided via jumping can't, and the list goes on. SO. Finding treasure. A lot of the treasure chests are pretty well hidden in my opinion, and being able to move the camera around implies that the developers really wanted players to get a grasp of their surroundings and see where they can go. In fact, there's a TON of emphasis on the exploration compared to the combat. Some challenges are just based around killing a certain amount of enemies with a certain weapon under a time limit or some other arbitrary condition. Others are based on finding secrets hidden in the area, which can involve walljumping off of a column and onto higher ground, going through a crack in the wall that you can just barely squeeze through, and many more ways. Victor Vran has the exploration and movement of a hack'n'slash adventure game, but has the combat of an ARPG limited to a hack 'N' slash formula.\n\nChallenges I'm adding this section to the review since I felt it needed it. This might mess up the flow of the review a bit. Anyway, Victor Vran is composed of large open areas that typically lead to smaller, mini areas. Dungeons if you will. Each area, both main and sub, have "challenges." These challenge can range from "kill x amount of enemies with x weapon" to "just kill this many enemies" to "kill 300 enemies in 2 minutes without getting hit because #challenge." Each challenge constitutes a star on the map, and as I stated earlier, is basically the only sense of "progression" you'll feel out of Victor Vran. And it doesn't even do a good job of doing that. Rewards for doing challenges are RIDICULOUSLY small, which is a real kick in the gut when the game makes such a big deal about completing challenges. W\hen you complete a challenge, a banner falls and lands where you are and poops out your prize. This can be a small, REALLY small amount of gold broken up into smaller gold piles to make you feel like you're getting a lot of gold, or a white grade weapon for that challenge of becoming Mozart and teaching weasels French. Challenges are supposed to make players feel inclined to complete a game fully, especially when an instant reward is tied to each one, but Victor Vran essentially asks "why did you even bother dude" and throws you something useless.\n\n"Hexes" are something I'll tack on real quick. I didn't mess with these at all, but they're basically the Skulls from Halo. They make the game """harder"""  but there's no reason to turn these on other than the useless challenges yelling at you to do so.\n\nI have one final gripe with this game.\n\nSense of Progression Destiny cards, transmutations, what have you. There are a lot of ways players can give themselves stats in Victor Vran. And that's basically it. As far as progression goes, upping your stats is the only thing there is. Weapons you get via drops are rarely better than what you're currently using, and when they are, it's only a marginal, two damage increase that you take because why not. You cannot change your attacks in any way (other than the demon spells or whatever they were called) and there is no skill tree. The only thing you have is this weird level up "system" where you pick a reward and the game yells at you saying you can up your stats by equipping even more destiny cards wowee. Aside from a bunch of stars on the map that said I did some challenge in an area, I did not feel like I made any progress in Victor Vran. Even when I upgraded or found a stronger weapon, it felt exactly the same. A lot of weapon types I would straight up not use because they were too boring to play for an extended period of time.\n\nClosing I feel that if Victor Vran focused on being just a hack'n'slash adventure or an ARPG, it would've been a lot better (leaning towards hack 'n' slash). Victor Vran had the potential to be something incredibly fun, but what I played was a weird mix of ideas that ultimately didn't go well together. It feels like a lot of people flocked to this game because it was new and "unique" and the store page literally says "dude this game is so skill based....holy....just wow dude....." and also says "character build" when the only way you can build a character is through stat boosts. And yes, which outfit you use is ultimately just a stat boost. Hell, a lot of the stat boosts are literally "when you do damage, you might do MORE DAMAGE." Almost every big and scary enemy that I enounctered was defeated using the traditional tactic of running/dodge rolling around until the enemy stopped attacking, going in for a few stabs or whacks or what have you, and moving when he went to do something else.\n\nIf you want a fun hack 'n' slash experience, I do not recommend Victor Vran.\nIf you want a fun ARPG experience, I do not recommend Victor Vran.","February 24","false","5.6"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","15","31","0","0"

I love iso arpgs but cannot stand to play them with a mouse, so major kudos to the devs for the gamepad support! Now with that out of the way, VV is good fun, not great, not the next Diablo, not even close, but its arcade style fast paced combat and jumping mechanic alone make this game worth trying. Ultimately, VV is a mash up between Bastion and Sacred 3.\n\nHonestly I'm on the fence about recommending the game. I sway to YES obviously but mainly I'm jaded because of the gamepad support that I so desperately want in iso arpgs.. Currently the game is stale and I became bored with the game very quickly. I don't get bored in arpgs...\n\nThe main problem is the type of level progression system used and the lack of variety with enemy mobs. I remember hitting level 2 and my only reward was loot (a shotgun I already had). I obtained only loot for leveling up. Really!?  I was given a weapon I already had after fighting non-stop spiders for a hour, the same exact spiders, which they didn't even bother to reskin. I remember a game for XBLA called Crimson Alliance doing something like this and I hated it. What happened to the level progression of old? The one where you level up skill trees and individual stats? ::::sigh::::\n\nI won't go any furthur with this review other than to say, several changes must be made to the final product for me to enjoy it. We'll see, I'm hopeful, the devs seem on it. For now don't believe the hype, the game has promise, but no where near deserving the huge amount of praise it is getting. Maybe its because I have played every game known to man, I dunno, but VV gets a 6/10, for now.","February 27, 2015","true","5.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You play as Victor, a character with demon powers, and must remove a curse from the city of Zagoravia in an overwhelmingly generic adventure. You are joined by a voice in your head that sometimes makes bad jokes but mostly stays quiet. The game emulates prominent titles in the genre, notably Diablo 3, with similar locations, monsters and abilities. The combat is different, with seven main weapon types that each have two skills. Most weapons are fun to use, with special mention going to the awesome lightning gun. Players can dodge during action to avoid damage, and jumping is used to find treasure or take shortcuts.\n\nThe city of Zagoravia is separated into handmade districts and each of those contains a number of dungeon-like areas. Each district repopulates with monsters if you fast-travel back to the town hub, and every dungeon resets the instant you leave it. This can be annoying if you explore a dungeon before the story sends you there. The main incentive to replay is to find legendary weapons and complete challenges in each level. Challenges might entice you to use another weapon or avoid taking health potions. Unfortunately many felt like a grind to force extra value and they often required the use of Hexes, which are just difficulty modifiers. Playing through the main campaign took about 11 hours and was largely forgettable. Once complete, there was almost no incentive to keep playing.\n\nMultiplayer fares better. It has great netcode which ensures the action is smooth. You will be going through the same areas as before, with the narrator repeating the same lines and monsters spawning in the same place. Only this time somebody might join and enable hard mode with all hexes to upset your game. So it’s probably best with friends in a private match. Either online or offline, Victor Vran has decent combat but it is not enough to earn a recommendation.\n\nRead my longer review[www.newgamenetwork.com]","August 21, 2015","false","18.8"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","11","25","0","2"

Aiming is highly dodgy at best. It even highlights enemies you put the mouse over, then proceeds to fire way wide of that target sometimes. The overkill mechanic seems to be pretty broken (or just doesn't make any sense). Hitting even a relatively weak enemy with no dicernible HP left with a hard-hitting attack (e.g. hammer smash) sometimes doesn't count as an overkill. This makes one challenge in particular almost impossibe to attain (except by fluke). There are also issues with movement and mouse tracking and other minor glitches. As a beta/early access, I could recommend this, but it clearly still needs to polish and tweaking. Nice try, but not quite there yet.","November 17, 2015","false","22.1"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/buryymedved/recommended/345180/","buryymedved","Medved","http://steamcommunity.com/id/buryymedved/","43 products in account","Victor Vran does not promise much and does little well. Essentially, it is a popcorn game that should not be purchased for more than five to ten dollars.\n\nWhat the game promises and does well includes "...hordes of monsters," "...a full co-op experience," and Xbox controller support. The player does indeed face hordes of monsters (which is also a negative discussed later on) and it may even prove overwhelming at times. Seldom does the player feel that he isn't in the midst of chaotic action. The co-op is intuitive and seamless (note, be sure that everyone in a lobby presses his face against all dungeon portals, or the dungeon may not be available from the fast travel map later). On top of these well-delivered promises, the controls themselves feel right (in terms of layout and responsiveness) for this specific game and carry over very well to controllers.\n\nHowever, the list of promises Victor Vran does not fulfill is more comprehensive: a "...story of the dark world...," "dynamic action," "extensive character development," and "huge variety in monster behavior."\n\nThe story aspect of this game is lackluster, boiling down to several flat cut scenes intertwined with lazy and uninspired boss fights (which have been done many times before and prove to be more of a chore than difficult). The atmosphere is quirky (not positively) and tries to take Handsome Jack's constant berating and taunting and make it its own in its main antagonist - where it fails is in its taking itself too seriously in terms of tone and pretending to have a higher purpose or deeper meaning. The game ends with not even a slap on the back or a sense that your six hours spent on completing the story was worth it - your actions are not impactful on the world at all. It feels as if the developers attempted to take their favorite parts of several games and splice them together (unfortunately, unsuccessfully) [note, gratuitous portal/time-traveling sand world strangely similar to that in Witcher 3].\n\nThe action and enemies are two-faced - yes, there are a ton of enemies and a lot of killing, colors, and explosions, but it is limited in depth and is an eternal grind in the end. There are maybe ten enemy types, not including their variations (which are essentially re-skins), and most of the time, they are difficult to distinguish from one another in terms of attacks and strategy. Many, if not most, of the enemies respawn immediately after being killed. "Difficult" in Victor Vran is defined in quantity over quality. The NPCs are indistinguishable and purposeless as separate entities as well.\n\nCombat is limited. There are about four different melee weapon-types and two gun types. There are two ultimates you can have equipped at a time later in the game and several "cards" which modify your character passively (for example, seven life steal per kill). This limits the player to using three abilities per weapon, an ultimate every once in a while, maybe switching weapons and using those three abilities, and popping health potions like there is no tomorrow (note, buy all the health potions and pray you find an infinite med kit). The crafting system is not explained and will probably result in the player losing many valuables in the course of gaining a clue. The player will also find himself with a ridiculous amount of money at the finish of the game and nothing to spend it on. The level designs are aesthetically-pleasing mostly but are poorly laid out, requiring teleporting to the next area about every four minutes. Death in Victor Vran is without penalty and may actually be a tactic to respawn and reuse healing statues.\n\nAll in all, Victor Vran is an alright game to spend two or three days of mindlessness over with solid controls, decent to good graphics, and great co-op. However, the game is a very superficial, uninspired, and minimal package in the end. Victor Vran feels incredibly lacking and more of a purposeless grind (unless the player wants to run past every monster, which is entirely possible excluding bosses). I advise spending no more than ten dollars for what the player receives.\n\nQuoted excerpts are taken from Victor Vran store page on Steam.\n\nEdit: changed to an actual review.","July 25, 2015","false","6.7"," 27 of 59 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","27","59","0","1"

Compared to Van Helsing it is just plain BAD.  I played through level 10 and let me tell you - it was a pure chore.  I'm not sure why it has gotten so many favorable reviews, because it doesn't deserve them.\n\nGame controls (at least for PC) are absolutely horrible.  Three attacks are allowed and two of those are special and on long timers.   Thirty percent of the time,  the game animation over-rides the ability to use the special attacks.\n\nBait and switch during boss battles (i..e., running around and letting a boss beat on you while some special power sucks the life outta you) is absolutely painful, even on casual.  Its almost as if the game is negatively encouraging you to replay completed levels over and over in order to get the weapons and cards necessary to defeat a boss.\n\nAdd in the fact that the weapons are basically uninteresting variations on three items - hammer, sword, shotgun, and it's basically a frustration-fest.  The demonic powers your supposed to obtain with the Overcharge ability are absolutely laughable...you push and push to get the overcharge event going and are rewarded with an unimpressive spurt of power.  To make matters more frustrating, Overcharge trickles away about 5 times faster than it takes to build up, ensuring that you surely wont use it often.\n\nI'll give the designers credit for the ambience and graphics, theyre pretty good, but gameplay totally ruins any kudos they might have gotten for that.\n\nMerchants are also horrible - I have yet to see any affordable weapons for sale that are useful at all (at least through level 10 when I finally said enough, and stopped playing).  Potions, what there are of them through level 10, are on timers, and are a complete waste of the gamer's coinage.  You can easily find potions just as good as you play though a level.\n\nThe game looks good, i'll give them that...but the gameplay is absolutely boring and uninspired and didn't draw me in to continue playing it.  Even having Geralt of Rivia's voice as the protagonist didn't persuade me to play a moment longer.\n\nBasically 4/10 - would not purchase again.","January 7","false","4.3"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","1"

And basically their answer is that we should grind the same content over and over to reach an arbitrary "maximum level" with no real incentive.\n\nThere is a bottomless pit wave mode. And challenges pertaining to each zone. But personally I'd prefer alot more story content to play through. It's just my personal taste, but I don't enjoy repeating maps just to complete challenges. If the devs had decided to go with an act system, adding acts after release, then the game would be alot better in my opinion. To me it just seemed like a first act playthrough and I'd liked to have seen another 2 or 3 acts.\n\nOutfits, which are designed to be some kind of build changing mechanic, aren't very numerous. 5 I think at the time of my runthrough, just after launch. So there is no real replay value as far as builds go.\n\nAll in all, the game is fun for about 10-20 hours. But I wouldn't recommend it simply because I don't think it's good value at full price.\n\n","August 16, 2015","false","26.0"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","0"

I play ARPG's more than any genre, Torchlight series, Diablo series, Van helsing sereies, Grim Dawn, Path of Exile, etc. etc. This game had tons of great reviews, had new interesting game mechanics, so I gave it a shot.\n\nFirst off, there is no real skill progressoin of any sort. Every ARPG i've ever played has a real solid RPG aspect, where you can really create your character how you want to. In Victor Vran, you equip a weapon, and the weapon gives you skills. You can equip "demon abilties" which are just charge up skills. Finally you get cards, these cards have some base passive stats for your character to give a minor customizable aspect to your character, but its very bland and doesnt feel like it changes anything. I can get past all of this for the most part, this im fine with.\n\nWhat breaks the game is the controls. There three options for controls, and yet all feel clunky. When it comes to ARPG's, tight controls make a game, and clunky controls break them. This had weird hit boxes where I would be clicking on an enemy, yet I would be walking to them rather then attacking them. Also the fact that multiple of the skills are on keys (W, E, etc.) but don't automatically attack when pressed. So therefor you need to Shift + key to attack. It's minor but it makes no sense. Im well aware shift is used in many ARPG's if not all of them. But when Im surrounded by 30 spiders, and want to using my PBAOE skill, i cant just click it, and have it go off.\n\nSecondly the map will randomly rotate your view and will be south after exiting a point. Im all for map control and camera rotation if its needed. The weird hit detection on things made it so I couldn't walk to area's and needed the camera rotation just to walk to the area i needed to go. So it's needed in this game, but it's needed because of bad mechanics. Map/camera rotation is something ARPG's simply dont need if the camera is implemented well, and can only sometimes confuse the player, there is no benefit to having it.\n\nIt's all these minor things like this that coupled with weird hit box detection that makes the combat feel bad and unsatifying. I really wanted to give this a chance for the simple fact that it was trying new things to broaden the ARPG horizons. It just wasn't implemented well, and thus I must give this a "No" recommendation.","July 28, 2015","false","0.9"," 7 of 29 people (24%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","24","7","29","2","0"

But mostly it's your typical action RPG with nothing special. The character customization is very lacking, 3 abilities per weapon and a severe lack of different type of weapons.\n\nWhat they have already is pretty cool, but there just needs to be a lot more of it. It just gets boring once you unlock lightning guns and mortars. Every item you find becomes a minor upgrade, levelling up is very minor (most of the time you just get 5 potions...).\n\nAnd the multiplayer is pretty lazy. Very few things are shared with the party. My friend had an ability that placed the "next hit is a crit" buff on targets, but that wasn't specific to him so my lightning gun ate up the charge and made his build worthless.\n\nI played this back when it first came on steam as early access, and it doesn't seem like it has come very far. It needs a lot more content. The character development needs an overhaul. It's incredibly casual.","June 28, 2015","false","5.2"," 18 of 56 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","18","56","0","1"

However, after clearing several maps that has changed or the worst. Now nearly every enemy takes 6 to 12 strikes to kill with every weapon I've tried. Trash mobs should be trash mobs not mini bosses. Obviously the developer was too lazy to build more locations with interesting enemies and smart AI so they simply gave every enemy ridiculous amounts of health to make the incredibly short maps "feel" longer than they are. It's a shame because the game mechanics, otherwise are interesting and fun; rolling, jumping, gear based character builds... But, the frustratingly slow, hour long progress, through what should be a 15 minute map ruins the game. I'd give it 2 out of 5 stars.","June 21, 2015","false","12.7"," 20 of 62 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","20","62","0","2"

Kudos to them for trying, as of yet the freeze has not occured, yay! Guys. Lots of edits, I bought this game when it was new, several updates since then, I urge you to read through this review to get a fair estimate of the game.\n\nEDIT: had to change this review to a not recommended due to the X freezing bug. It's a fun game, but it's broken under Linux. It'll be uninstalled until I see this specific bug fix in the changelogs. Tropico had a very similar problem, no other game does, it's all on the devs to fix this now.\n\nThis game is fun! I gotta admit, I was hesitant because my experience with Tropico 5 wasn't good, but I chanced my money because of the fantastic art style in the game and I was very pleasantly surprised.\n\nYou like dungeon crawling? Loads of randomized loot? Special attacks, bonuses, spell casting, bashing, slashing and dodging? It's all in here! Haeimont proves that dungeon crawlers can be fun, engaging and beautiful, still making them relevant in 2015.\n\nUnlike other titles in the genre, Victor Vran offers a dynamic realtime game mechanic, whether you're using a controller or mouse + keyboard the controls are crisp and responsive, it almost feels like a high quality platformer in that regard. Good thing the controls are crisp, because you will need to be nimble on your feet to survive these dungeons. It's much more than a hack and slash, it offers a varied range of tactics, if you mindlessly rush in and just mash buttons the game will punish you.\n\nI like the voice acting (it really works for this game), the music is fantastic and the art work spectacular. Everything is put together in this nice package that compels me to explore and try different tactics. There are a few things that could be better for multiplayer (separate loot instances are not my cup of tea), but nothing that would keep me from playing online. It's still a blast to complete the different quests and missions with your friends.\n\nAll this said, they still need to iron out a few bugs on Linux. Just as with Tropico 5, the game will freeze and lock your X display when you have the highest graphical settings, forcing me to use the lowest settings and even then there are the occational crashes and texture bugs.\nI'm hoping the developers will actually fix this because the art style is fantastic, I rarely enjoy/miss shiny graphics, but for this game I really want to use my GTX880M to it's fullest. Victor Vran deserves... Nay, Victor Vran demands it!\n\nRemember kids, the only sparkles you'll see on a vampire is the gold it drops when yous shoots it!","July 11, 2015","true","75.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/schmidtbag/recommended/345180/","schmidtbag","Toastmaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/schmidtbag/","83 products in account","This game was a lot better than I expected.  Very similar to Diablo II; better in most ways, worse in a few others.  For an indie game, this has great graphics, decent replay value, and a good amount of content (kept me occupied for over 25 hours in my first playthrough, not including elite challenges).  Linux performance is great, too.  Read any of the positive reviews and they'll tell you all you need to know about what makes this a great game that's worth buying (it definitely is worth buying).  But I do have a few complaints:\n\n1.  The ability to dodge is great and something I use all the time, but shields would've been a nice option too.  Very often I'll find myself in a situation where dodging damage is simply unavoidable.  Considering there are some challenges expecting you to make X amount of kills without getting injured or stay above Y% life, this gets to be pretty annoying.\n2.  There seems to be a poor balance to the weapons.  The shotguns, scythes, and rapiers seem to be overpowered while the hammers, swords, and mortars are almost uselessly weak.  Considering each weapon type has it's own set of advantages, this also makes certain challenges nearly impossible to achieve.\n3.  Gold is pretty much worthless.  Your inventory is unlimited, there are all sorts of items to help increase your gold count, and you can easily find everything you need that is as good or better than what you can get from the merchants.  The only thing I ever found myself spending gold on were transmutations.  The gold could've been more useful if you had a limited capacity in your inventory, and if the merchants had better things for sale.\n4.  Though the level of detail in each level is great, having at least some of the maps randomize like they do in other games would've been nice for replay value.\n5.  I'm not sure why, but this game seems to be seriously lacking bass in my surround system.  It doesn't seem to take advantage of the rear speakers either.  Not a big deal, just a little weird that only 3 of my 6 channels were used.","May 7","true","25.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But when I finally got the game, I could see the difference. The game has the stereotypical charm of an ARPG like Torchlight, but the developers have changed a few things for the game to stand out from the others. The jump mechanism has been added in the game which surprisingly works well in this genre where all you do is click to other areas to evade attacks. Along with this change, there are a lot of changes to the control scheme of the game that tries not to decrease the life span of your mouse with incessant clicks (Though they are still pretty much there). Full voice acting is a welcome addition to the game and it's done well. Character progression has been also done differently as you don't invest in skill sets, but acquire powers from time to time as loot or purchases (Each weapon has a different powerup as well). The major gripe I have with this game is the variety. After playing for 2 hours or so, you feel like you have experienced what the game is all about. Games like Torchlight present you with abundant variety for you to remain glued to the game for hours unlike this one. However, the challenges in the game might ameliorate this deficiency if you have OCD like me. Would definitely recommend a purchase at a discount.","May 7","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first, you will probably think that the cheesy voice acting and awkward plot are just a good dev making a bad mistake.  I did, and I was wrong.  Since  Haemimont Games are responsible for the Tropico franchise, I should have known better.  They obviously set out to make a B-Game, and they ♥♥♥♥ing hit it out of the park.  The more you settle in to this one, the more it'll worm it's way in to your favorites.\n\nThe setting is a bit Victorian Gothic, and Vran looks and plays like Diablo combined with Devil May Cry.  The voice acting is a touch wooden, but not over-the-top.  Just enough to fit the tongue-in-cheek vibe of the narrative, and it progressively improves as you start to realize the intent behind this game.  Speaking of narration, the narrator himself is just about my favorite part of the game.  He keeps up running jokes, an interesting dialogue, and (of course) drops some references to just about every leg of gaming/nerd culture that can be comfortably fit in to the game's narrative.  The plot does dip in a place or two, but nothing worth noting.\n\nI can not recommend this game enough to anyone who enjoys ARPGs, Classic Horror, B-Movies or just a well-tuned game that doesn't take itself too seriously.  Now, as far as those game mechanics I mentioned earlier, this is the fastest rundown I can give you:\n\nSeveral different weapon and ability types, all of which function differently, allowing you to really fine-tune your playstyle.  The game looks great and runs great, and the movement and mechanics are mostly pretty sound.  You might miss a jump here and there, or be bothered by the lack of inversion for camera movement, but it ain't gonna kill you.  Good enemy variety, great music, online co-op (local announced but not implemented), PvP, a Survival Mode, Hardcore Mode, and the constantly changing Cauldron of Chaos that provides a steady stream of new challenges and killer loot.  Transmutation, for those that are familiar with the item mechanic, is pretty solid.  There are also Bounties and Treasure Hunts (shareable between players, ffs!), and there are no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ inventory restrictions, although inventory management can become a pain.\n\nI'm forgetting ♥♥♥♥, and I know it.  I don't care.  Buy the damned game and find out what I missed, because it's ♥♥♥♥ing worth it.","May 20","true","57.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have a variety of different weapons to use at will, equiping any two at a time and have the ability to swap between them in combat.  You also have two potion slots, and two (spell?) slots.  Each weapon will have a basic attack and two special attacks.  Then as you build overdrive you can use your spells, which according to how you build your character they can assist you in many different ways.  The next thing you have is destiny cards.  These basically sum up your attributes in a way.  While one might give you 100 crit damage, the other one might give you 5% crit chance.  The slots for destiny cards has to be unlocked and there is a point system on how you can equip them (the higher level destiny cards cost more points.)\n\nSo after that, the loot.  You get lots of weapons, destiny cards, and spells but i believe the only three pieces of armor I had gotten were from quests.  There are a lot of similar creatures throughout the whole game.  Skeletons, spiders, essences, vampires, and maybe a couple more.  There were no blood in the game, so it made a better choice to play with my younger son.  Most of your defense will be from dodge-rolling out of the way of danger.\n\nYour weapons damage and stats can be increased by transformation.  Combination of three spells can upgrade the weapons stats, then certain runes will increase the damage.  The story did not take too long to beat and this is another one of those games where you can keep putting the difficulty up, leveling, completing challenges  and dont forget playing coop with others online.\n\nVictor Vran was a fun game for me and I would recommend it if you like hack&slash dungeon crawler type games.","May 22","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reminds me of the Diablo games.\n\nEasy to just pick up and play. Controls are explained in the initial tutorial and listed in-game HUD, so no confusion. NOTE: much better with a controller!\n\n","May 26","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Non stop action! Amazing graphics! Amazing dialogues! The story is amazing! I just wanna hug the writer! Amazing work!\nBUT: the game requires 8gb ram, which is more than your average laptop. To know how much RAM you have you can watch videos on it in YouTube.\n\nThe bottom line: this game is recommended to role playing lovers, action lovers. Good work haimemont!","June 5","true","30.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay-wise, think of it as Dark Souls III and Diablo III in one.\nThe developers did a tremendously good job of balancing the game. I've played for a quite a while (disregard the number of hours noted above, I've played offline for a considerable amount of time) and It's not so hard that you'll die time and time again, It's just hard enough to keep things fun and interesting.\n\nI really think Destiny cards add a huge aspect to the gameplay, as well as being able to choose what demon power you want to use. This means that you can always be molding your abilities into exactly how you want them.\nIt's a great feeling to utterly obliterate a huge group of enemys with a single blow. In Victor Vran, you can do that and much, much more.","June 5","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
