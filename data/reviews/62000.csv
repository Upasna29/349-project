It's a game where you guide airplanes and helicopters to color coded landing pads and that's about it. Landing your very first plane and your very last one will be exactly the same. The game never changes in any meaningful way and it shouldn't take you more than a couple of minutes to realize that it's nothing but the same simple grind from start to finish.\n\nThe controls are made for a touchscreen but shouldn't frustrate you too much, the graphics are the classic mobile ones, not exactly ugly but very unfulfilled on a PC monitor.\n\nThis is not a game you should buy, it might not be bad for those 30 second mobile gaming sessions but on the PC, on STEAM, it's just a waste of space.

It's not my type of game but being older made me more open towards new genres. The first time I've reviewed it on Steam with a few words were in 2010. I'm not surprised that I had the game since that time: I was probably influenced by the cheerful screenshots.\n\nYour goal is to land aircrafts on the right path, avoiding also collisions between them. The more you advance, the more aircrafts you'll have on your screen, and the more difficult it will be to manage everything. Also, you'll unlock new airfields: island, jungle, snow (as part of an old Christmas stuff), circus (where you have to go through portals), etc..\n\nIt's very fun and makes you very aware of what is happening on your screen: some aircrafts are faster than others and it may be a problem at one moment (if their paths are crossing each other). Also, they're coming from every part and they're also different: choppers, big aircrafts, biplanes, military jets, etc.. You can easily spot them because of their shapes but also of their different bright colors (that's also how you can spot the right lane to land). It's a true challenge to manage every one of them once your screen is full of them.\n\nDon't worry though for a collision, you're warned about them: the aircrafts are circled with red and you have, if I remember correctly, a little alarm going off. Also, you're warned from which side they're coming.\n\nWith a perfect landing, you'll be rewarded by a text in different languages, congratulating you. Everything is done to make you proud and also to encourage you to keep the good work.\n\nThe graphics are very colorful and simple and it's perfect for that type of game. Besides, the soundtrack is very cheerful.\n\nFlight Control HD is really a little good game on PC, even if I can see the potential of it on any tablet or mobile device. However, while the game is for everyone, I can also understand that some players will be frustrated by the collisions and the repetitive gameplay: you're landing aircrafts by making them follow a path, praying that no other will cross them unless you decide that it's worth a shot given the speed of each vehicle.\n\nI've played the game a lot for the achievements. I remember mainly one not unlocking despite being sure to have met the requirements but I suppose that it wasn't clear enough for me, or it was my English, or it was just the wrong use of words.\n\nAs I've said, the game was released in 2010. The game is still fun to play today, however, after a little search, the PC version is the less updated: the Android/iOS applications have more content or were at least updated until 2015. The Mac version has an exclusive map too.\n\nI had fun with that game and I never regretted that purchase.","November 19, 2010","true","17.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So, I'm writing an initial review immediately and I'll update it later.\n\nAt first I thought it might be too simple to suit me, but it got challenging VERY fast.  Plus, you can redirect flights as often as you need to avoid collisions.  In some ways this reminds me of some of those old Atari games but with a fluffy modern twist.\n\nI got it on sale and am very happy to have it.  I hope they continue to update it, maybe with additional modes and challenges.\n\nUpdate:  I've played enough now to say....this thing gets massively hard, FAST!  hehe  Nobody will ever accuse this game of lacking challenge.  This game will _break you_!  lol  It has leaderboards for each map too.\n\nEven the first map gets very challenging after 50 planes, and is rough getting over 100.  My high score is 150 and I'm amazed that I managed that.  I usually lose between 70-100.  I just finished trying the 3rd map, a 5 star map.  It started off slow and easy, and then it opened the mother load on me after about 10-15 planes.  Wow!  Talk about massive mega challenge.\n\nThe only thing I would suggest to the Dev, is to add a 3rd speed which is 50% slower than the slow speed is now, that way we can really try and get strategic and micromanage our way through really heavy jams, rather than just saying, "I always lose about here".  That would be great, because as it is, you really can't get too far, unless you're an absolute pro at this sort of thing.\n\nImagine playing Tetris and going from level 1, to 'Insta-Drop' in less than 5 minutes.  That's how hard this gets that fast.  Again, I still highly recommend this.  Very fun!","December 27, 2014","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though Flight Control HD looks deceptively simple at first - just grab an aeroplane (or a helicopter) and send it towards a runway (or a landing pad) -, in reality it's anything but. Once you start pursuing the achievements and new personal bests, it'll really challenge your mouse skills and reaction times. Some of the levels add their own twists to the game, like planes heading for an emergency landing that cannot be rerouted. The graphics are simple yet charming, and the music delightful, if a tad repetitive. Recommended for all ages.","July 13, 2011","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have to match the colour to land on the adequate runway, avoiding collisions. A safety net will trigger to warn you about a short term conflict so that you have enough time to react. Almost each level has a specific feature : wind, water, emergency aircraft (get out of its path !), stunt, ...\n\nInitially, this game has been designed for tablets, but the gameplay is fine on Steam, even with a mouse and a keyboard : drawing trajectories should not be an issue. Having access to leaderboards kind of increase the end game, but, sadly, at the moment, almost nobody is playing this game. At only 3,99€, I strongly recommend it !","August 1, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whatintheblazes/recommended/62000/","whatintheblazes","Whatin theBlazes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whatintheblazes/","915 products in account","I've played this for 5 years. While this is a port of an iOS game, the port is fine, there's no cash shop, and it's built up around actual game mechanics that have some actual depth behind them. The graphics are flash, so they're simple but scale infinitely without quality loss, regardless of the player's resolution. If you have multiple monitors like me there's some weirdness with the game pausing if I do something on a different monitor, but that ended up feeling like a feature instead of a bug most of the time.\n\nThe basic gameplay is managing different kinds of aircrafft that are coming in for landing at an airport. The craft can't land just anywhere and are color coded to match the correct runway. They're smart as bricks but always follow orders perfectly, even at their own peril. The player directs them by clicking and dragging their desired path, similar to how a graphic artist uses a vector pen tool. Different levels = different airports, with their own sets of obstacles and challenges. There are 9 levels and speed up button (hotkey F), but the game autodrops speed back to normal if it decides two planes are too close.\n\nThe main gameplay challenge to the player comes from the random nature of when and where planes appear, the game ratcheting up the number of incoming planes over time, and that the planes come in at different speeds. If two vehicles ever crash, the level is over.\n\nSo what kind of player is Flight Control HD for? The main appeals are:\n(1) Stress relief/relaxation/a diversion. Somewhat like the effect last hitting and denying in DOTA produces for some people, Flight Control creates a zen sort of state where I can turn my higher brain off, wind down, and just enjoy directing planes around for a bit, then get back to whatever I was doing. For me the perfect time to do this is when I'm trying to solve a completely different problem. The casual pick-up-and set-down-whenever-you-want nature of the game also lends itself to this. The soundtrack has only one song. While it won't win any awards, it does fit the mellow mood the game is going for quite well.\n\n(2) Score attack, and RTS micro practice, although this can conflict with using the game to relax. There are online leaderboards, which still work fine 5 years after the game was released. As far as I can tell, the leaderboards also seem to be free of cheating unlike, say, certain indie platformers or the latest Call of Duty titles, so props to the developer for that. Levels start easy but ramp up to quite hard if you're going for a top score. In other words, the game scales with what you put into it. As a result you'll probably get out exactly the level of challenge that you want. Be warned that having 50+ planes on the screen gets stressful, especially on maps with a lot of plane types. My brain just doesn't like that, and I've ragequit a few times.\n\nProbably not worth full price, but for me this game has been surprisingly good.","May 29, 2015","true","32.0"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Easy for the first minute but it quickly gets difficult as the number of planes in the air keeps growing. Playing one round does not take much time and it's easy to fall for the "just one more round" trap. There are only some ten different maps but depending on how determined you are to break your old records or your friends' records you might actually spend quite a while playing this game.","December 20, 2010","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
