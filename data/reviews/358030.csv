Another Star is among the most compelling and original of them I've played in years.  Before you dismiss the game based on its apparently gimmicky retro feel, consider that this game is NOT made using RPGMaker and IS made by people who actually played those old games when they were new, and who loved them, and whose lives were affected by that experience.  This game is a love letter to a lost friend, a time and place we can never return to but will never forget.\n\nAll that being said, Another Star feels fresh and original despite its archaic appearance.  I have found the writing especially compelling.  The world building is spectacular and immersive, reflected in the dialogues among characters, the excellent character portraits, and the game systems themselves.  This is a primitive world experiencing its own Iron Age.  Small settlements dot the lush landscape, populated by numerous ancestral clans, each with their own goals and histories.  There are allies, uneasy peaces, rivalries, and wars.  The central protagonist is son to the patriarch of one such clan.  As you can imagine from this setup, a GoT-like cascade of betrayals, deaths, and heroic acts crashes through the narrative.\n\nThe adventure begins when a falling star crashes into the wilderness and the clans send their heroes to retrieve it first, hoping it will give them godlike powers to defeat their rivals and secure their longevity.  It becomes quickly apparent that the falling star was in fact a vessel from a technologically advanced society.  I was immediately reminded of Vernor Vinge's sci-fi masterpiece A Fire Upon the Deep, which, among many other things, chronicles the effects of such an event upon a primitive world.  Another Star won't be winning any Hugo Awards, but it does confront the issue with depth and nuance, and it doesn't flinch away from the catastrophic damage and transformative unravelling that inevitably occurs when the primitive crashes against the advanced.  It's happened on our own world, again and again.  But even while grappling with these themes, the writing remains personal and intimate, such that I always feel invested in the fate of the individual characters.\n\n“The Universe does not care, and even with all our science there are some disasters that we can not avert. All evil and good is petty before nature. Personally, we take comfort from this, that there is a universe to admire that can not be twisted to villainy or good, but which simply is.”\n― Vernor Vinge, A Fire Upon the Deep\nOk let's talk a little about the gameplay itself.  There is a standard overworld spritemap dotted with settlements and other points of interest- some of which are hidden, so explore.  Entering a settlement brings up a menu that allows you to visit the clan's chief, talk to villagers, sleep at the tavern, or shop.  Visiting the chief requires a donation relative to the clan's power, but bestows a buff on the party for some time.  The responses of the villagers are very interesting and change as events progress and relationships among the tribes evolve.  If you find yourself stuck this can be a good thing to do because you may hear an important clue.  Also, any "loot" acquired from battle is automatically exchanged for cash whenever you enter a settlement.\n\nBattles. The battle system is excellent.  First off, random encounters are usually optional. An exclamation point flashes above your head and you can press a button to engage.  However, I would recommend fighting every single battle you can, because dungeons and bosses are often quite challenging and you are going to want every point of xp you can get.  There is a standard "fight-skill-item-defend" type menu but its execution is quite different.  You only get to select one command and then your entire party fulfills it.  For example, if you attack, everyone in your party attacks. Furthermore, they each attack all of the enemies at once.  Healing items are dear so most healing comes from a small boost you get from defending- a technique your enemies will also use.  Magic is powerful but items are uncommon and actually casting spells costs hit points.  Battles take thought and require careful risk and reward assesment and boss fights can be long and arduous but also tense and ultimately fulfilling upon victory.  The system is so compelling and so tactically satisfying that I'm hoping others will take note and adapt some of the principles into the tired menu clicking paradigm most JRPGs still employ.\n\nI'm going to stop here because I don't want to over-discuss this game.  Part of the joy of a game like Another Star is the wonder of self-discovery.\n\nIn a genre overrun with mediocrity, Another Star is truly remarkable.  In fact, I give it a rare 8/10- highly recommended to anyone, essential for JRPG collectors and for those of us who were there when games like it were new.\nNo Drama, Just Reviews","October 24, 2015","true","4.2"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

Don't let that keep you from getting the game.\n\nSome key features of this game are:\nQuirky, fast-paced battle system--turnbased, but fast-paced.  Tactics will vary from your typical JRPG (a good thing).\nSurprisingly interesting and different story from what I expected so far.  Although the dialogue/characterization isn't top notch, it's decent.  If I find a certain character annoying, it's probably because that character is just an annoying person, not because he/she is annoyingly portrayed.\nRandom encounters can be largely skipped while exploring; a huge boon, considering the nonlinear dungeons and secrets sprinkled throughout those as well as the world map itself.\nMusic is mostly catchy 8-bit style chiptunes reminiscent of (but higher quality than) Dragonquest and other NES-era games.\nFullscreen or windowed mode.\nCustomizeable controls, via editing a text file--easy, human readable format. Support for Numeric Keypad keys is forthcoming according to the developer but not yet enabled (8/5/2015).\nThe developer is involved in the community and personally helps with troubleshooting, takes suggestions, and generally seems a cool, likeable guy, too. =) A huge plus, for me.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who remembers and enjoys 8-bit or early 16-bit era RPGs.  It has some modern quality of life features mixed in with oldschool aesthetics and some quirky twists on old mechanics.\n\nIt's not the biggest, baddest indie RPG on the block, but it's different, nostaligic, and just fun to play.","August 5, 2015","true","10.5"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

Everyone with some half baked story thinks they can make the next Final Fantasy using RPGMaker. But then I looked closer.\n\nIT WASNT MADE IN RPGMAKER. Cool! Just like One Way Heroics, a console-looking but really unique game (also not made in RPGMaker) that I love.\n\nSo I picked it up. Ive played literally thousands of RPGs. I remember the 8bit and 16bit eras. I remember when RPGMaker  first came out,. For the most part, its games were donation-only, and teams worked to make great (but limited by RPGMaker itself) games. I'm so burned out on console style turn based RPGs, that to be interested in one got to have a compelling well written story, decent balance, and something that sets it apart from the herd.\n\nAnother Star has all that. If youre a fan of console RPGS, this one is way better than paying who-knows-what for another RPGMaker yawnfest. Even if youre burned out, its worth picking up. It is set so you dont have to grind if you dont want to. Always a plus, as grinding just to progress is one of those things that should be left in the past. You can also get rid of that annoying "CRT scanlines and convex screen" effect in the options. Its cute, but thats another thing that should be left in the past.\n\nOverall, its well done. Keeps the good parts of retro console RPGs and dumps the annoying parts.\n\nEDIT: I  would like to point out that the overworld music is seriously the most awesome retro-rpg music ever!","September 23, 2015","true","5.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

The clan-based story is interesting, the writing is good, and the combat - which does away with targeting and simply applies attacks across all party members - is extremely fast (especially if you hold the X button on the gamepad to speed up the text). The latter part makes a huge difference when you need to grind out a level or two here or there. The visuals and audio feel like they are straight out of my childhood, which was spent playing many different RPGs on my NES, TG-16, and SNES consoles. If I could change one thing, it'd be the font, which I find isn't the easiest for reading, and the aspect ratio (I just prefer 16:9 on my TV). Okay, so that's two things, but I'd change them both if I could. The rest of the game is pretty much perfect as-is.","August 19, 2015","true","29.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

That said, I really do like this game.\n\n\nOne of my favorite things about the game is that there are multiple difficulty levels, so if you really want the old school "grind it out" experience, you can have that, or if you really don't have the time/energy for that kind of stuff, you can have an experience that allows you to focus more on the story. Regardless of your difficulty level, the game feels well-balanced, though if you get yourself in too deep or feel the game is too easy, you can change that difficulty.\n\nI also really enjoy the graphics, and this version is much better than the two before it, which weren't bad to begin with.\n\nIf you're on the fence, try the demo.

The game offers varying difficulty and character growth levels, with even the harder difficulties relatively well balanced. Personally, I think the enemies that can heal/absorb hitpoints are a bit overpowered, especially on higher difficulties, but that's the only thing that bothered me. Playing on Hard difficulty and Old School (25%) growth rate, I still felt very little need to grind to advance in the game, so I never felt like I was stuck on an insurmountable obstacle.\n\nDespite the imposed limitations, the graphics are quite pretty, especially the enhanced battle sprites. The game also allows you to disable the CRT scanline effect or adjust its curvature, as well as letting you toggle screen flashing/shaking and vsync.\n\nThe music is spectacular, each track giving the proper tone in the scenes they play and never gets repetitive. Fortunately, the dev has put up a free download for the soundtrack on his website with some unused tracks, too.\n\nThe story is interesting, though admittedly has some cliché moments, but it fits well with the type of game it is paying homage to. The game does have a number of typos and small errors, but they're getting fewer with each update.\n\nOverall, I greatly recommend this game. Even if you're not familiar with the old RPG style, you might still be able to get a kick out of this game.

Immediately went to pick it up as soon as I could. I know I haven't played it much since I only bought it today but the look and feel and how everything functions plus the background music which I think is so important for these type of games is just spot on. I'm sure people have mentioned this already but it truly feels like a game made back in the NES days of old. They really went for the 'old school' aesthetic on this one because even the full screen looks like you're using a not so big television set from the 80's. If that bothers you though you can play around with the settings to see what suits you best.\n\nDon't think I'm good at writing reviews and it's not my type of thing to do but I feel like I just had to write one for this fabulous game. I read that the creator is already working on a sequel for "Another Star" so if you want to play a good rpg that's not made using ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rpg maker and it's actualy a good game witha good story and a great main protag I highly recommend you pick this one up.\n\nI love old school stuff and old school inspired stuff as well, I'm a sucker for it.

This game defintiely deserves one, however.\n\nI went into this game expecting a retro experience with maybe just a bare minimum of a game, like most retro games out there.  I liked the premise, but the battle system seemed simplistic, and I was skeptical when I read that the game was ~20 hours.\n\nThus, I was pleasantly surprised when the mediocre impression I had before firing up the game proved completely wrong.  This game is definitely old-school in that it will be hard, even on the regular setting, but it rewards you for exploring everywhere all the time.  Even up to the final endgame portion of Another Star there was more stuff to find and more of the games world and lore to learn about.\n\nAnd to that point, the plot is actually pretty darn good as far as retro games go.  It's very Star Ocean/Phantasy Star-esque, which is what drew me to the game in the first place.  Yet, unlike a lot of games that go down this route, Another Star doesn't fall into the trap of doing too much with it's plot and fully explores the gameworld without feeling like there's too much extraneous padding.  I can say without a doubt it's a very satisfying and good plot, even if some of the running gags got a little old by the end.\n\nMy only complaint is that the difficulty balance seems planned around the "High" growth rate.  For most of the game, the battle system is surprisingly deep, with a wide variety of enemy strategies employed throughout the game, and much more thought involved than you might initially think!  However, I played ~2/3 of the game with the "Standard" growth rate, and a number of brutal encounters, but around that point it's almost unwinnable without large level gains for their HP increases.  Enemy magic is also brutal--elemental resistance equipment is worth its weight in gold.  So much so I would advise everyone playing this to keep those Waterproof Ponchos on hand the second you can get them early, because they were useful essentially until the last stages of the game.\n\nTL;DR: Buy this game if you like older, turn-based RPGs!  It will be worth your cash and time, for sure!","May 25","true","29.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
