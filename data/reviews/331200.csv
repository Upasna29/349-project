"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DzejPi/recommended/331200/","DzejPi","DzejPi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DzejPi/","1735 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOh su funi and random eks di eks di. Okay, the fun's over. Absolute rock bottom. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind stupid ways to have fun. I even found Goat Simulator (at least slightly) amusing, because - say what you want about it, but it clearly included some work being done, the city was filled with easter eggs, stuff to do, there were achievements, workshop support, etc. The developer is claiming that this is not trying to be Goat Simulator, but I'm absolutely sure this piece of software tried to go the same way while completely missing the point, offering no fun, basically no gameplay and failing at being funny.\n\nThe developer of this piece software completely misuderstood the point of Goat Simulator and thought that [insert random word here] Simulators are funny, because they are poorly made and you can't do anything there. Also making this type of "simulator" now is not even beating a dead horse, because the horse has been dead for half of the year, it's basically beating a horse skeleton now. I guess that developer decided to download Unity 3D and tried to put something together in it. Nothing against him, but you can clearly see he has absolutely no idea what he is doing. The menu is barely working, "Exit Game" button in the main menu doesn't work at all, other buttons in some game mods are bugged as well. Anyway let's get to the point. The game has four game mods. So let's do this, shall we?\n\nClassic\nFirst mode is called Classic. The first thing you will notice is a mouse cursor visible while playing, but it goes away when you click the mouse button. Second thing you will notice is absolutely insane performance. I have about 10-15 FPS on this small map on the fastest settings. On a small map with some grass and few ridiculously small cows randomly placed there. I would seriously like to know the reason of it being more hardware demanding than Crysis. I have two theories. First is that the physics (this is using PhysX, or at least it was installing it) is badly coded, second theory is that it's because there are like thousands of trees on the edge of the map. If you go too far, you die instantly and go back. But I found out that if you hold W and you keep holding it while dying, you just get back up and you can continue with your journey for self-discovery. The cows are stuck in 2 seconds long animation and you can even see when they are reseting. You have some weapons, which are absolutely pointless anyway, because there is nothing to shoot with them, except the ground, which is something, I guess? If you shoot the cow, nothing happens. There are bullet decals, but they are levitating in the air, because cows have invisible square hitboxes around them. Another thing is that these guns are stock default Unity guns I had pleasure to see in another awesome piece of software known as Air Control, and trust me, I would like to be joking. There are few round collectables on the ground that can be collected that will make you move faster or will slow down a time. I remember them from Air Control as well, so I think these things are included in Unity, or maybe in its Pro version. Well, that's the first mode for you anyway, let's move to the second one.\n\nGrass\nYou... do nothing there, you can move the camera around and watch model of grass moving upwards from the ground. Su randum! Also there is a sketch of corn. It's not even modelled, it's just 2D picture with two colours used. Okay, that's the grass mode. This mode has bugged menu, because when I tried to click the button to go back to Main Menu, it didn't do anything, so I had to shut it down to be able to "play" another mode. Now let's skip to it!\n\nDubstep\nCuz you know, if you have no idea what to do, put dubstep there. In this mode there is just a very small map (with fence being the border) with some lights, dubstep music playing there and the cows rotating around. Comedy gold! The terrain is glowing and sky is moving. I guess it's hardcore party. There is one hipster cow that's not part of the crowd. This cow is flying, changing the scale, etc. I thought: "Wow, developer can scale a cow model, impressive!"\n\nRange\nI think that Range mode is supposed to be shooting mode, but to be honest, it doesn't work for me, so I guess it's broken. There is nothing happening when I load it. When I press Escape, I bug through the ceiling and fall on the ground and then... still nothing. Keys on my keyboard aren't doing anything and mouse as well, so I couldn't move and couldn't even move camera around. I guess you can use this mode as a wallpaper.\n\nSo that's Grass Simulator for you! Su funi! "But it's in Early Access!", you could say and the developer is promising another features added in the future. That's right, but look, there are good and promising games in Early Access that are only getting better and then there is this thing which obviously will never be good, because the developer is lacking developing skills and the whole idea of Grass Simulator is stupid to begin with. I would like to be proven wrong, but I don't think I will. For me, the biggest problem with this software is that skilled person would be able to make it in a day and amateur in few days with help of some YouTube tutorials. The most baffling thing is that this is being sold for actual money. It could be okay as a some learning project for developer on some website where you could play it in the web browser, but it's not okay as a product on Steam being sold for actual money. Especially for 8,99€ (10% off). I find this price absolutely ludicrous and mocking all the people who bought this for full price, because you can get Skyrim for lower price when it's on sale. Last message is for bunch of internet "comedians" making the same tired jokes in their reviews - we've already seen it milions of times, so you are not funny nor original, also you're giving it bigger score (Mostly Positive at the time of writing this review) that could mislead some people into thinking that this is actually something good.","November 16, 2014","false","1.4"," 772 of 812 people (95%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","95","772","812","39","13"

Could go either way.  I normally NEVER review a game but after running this software (was no playing and definately not a game) and reading what other people say.  I loaded it up in every mode and for one I couldn't kill anything. I brought up the guns and blasted away But at point blank range it didn't hurt or even leave a mark on a cow or on the cutouts in the "Shooting Range"\nI ran around and it just ended after a few minutes in teh "classic" mode, in the shooting range your stuck in a building you can't leave, And in all the other "modes" I couldn't even move. Although on pause the cows did.\nIf you want to load a program that has no purpose. Other than I guess you can get enjoyment out of spinning cows while it is paused. Then this is what you want.

It reminds me of an old default Windows screensaver, just walking around in a field. And maybe shooting targets. I don't know, I couldn't even get to that. I get terrible FPS on such a tiny game, but that might just be my computer.

It doesn't cost much, no, but you do have better games for the same price to spend your money on.\n\nClassic Mode:\nHas no objective at all. You walk around in a reasonably small world filled with a single cabin, grass, fences, trees and cows with buggy heads. Shooting the cows makes them explode but once you've seen that once and you've giggled - do you want to see it again?\n\nGrass Mode:\nWhy would you even put this into a game? You don't spend money on a game to watch grass grow. You can't move or equip anything. All you do is sit in your chair and watch grass grow. Paint-Drying simulator will be the next release.\n\nDubstep Mode:\nI laughed for about six miliseconds. Stingy cow animations with some tacky lighting effects and some terrible dubstep music. Putting two-and-two together, yes, it's just spinning cows dancing to music. Done.\n\nRanged Mode:\nUm, this is meant to be a "Grass Simulator", not a FPS. Completely irrelevant to the game, and once again has no clear objective. The mace is pointless; you can't kill cows with it and you can't actually get out of the cabin that you spawn in on this mode.\n\nSnowfall Mode:\nThis mode is the only one which actually has detail. Probably my favourite mode because the map is actually extremely well modeled, but much like the Classic Mode, has no objective whatsoever. Just walking around in a snowy place with, oh! Guess what! Cows!\nAt first I thought it was a direct model from KHOLAT.\n\nBad Party Mode:\nThis mode does one thing, and one thing only. Generate lag. Guess what! Cows again! Superspeed cows with lights hanging off their backs and dying. For people to laugh at that they really must have a bad sense of humour. Sorry, but why would you put things like that in a game, especially since people actually paid money for this?\n\nOnline Mode:\nGah, what do I say about this? Like I said before, if you call a game "Grass Simulator", you must be mad to turn it into an FPS. People seem to be invincible, the aiming sucks, the bobbing of the weapons, although it's realistic, makes it extremely difficult to see what you're doing.\n\nAll In All, this game is just a waste of money. This game would be perfect if it was a Free to Play game and is very good at pointlessly consuming 20 minutes of your life. You're better off just watching videos of this game and saving your money.","June 21, 2015","false","6.4"," 100 of 114 people (88%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","88","100","114","22","6"

Since then, the "game" has been released from Early Access. I've updated my review with a few alterations so note that I HAVE tried the "game" out of Early Access.\n\nFirst Impression Review\nI'll be using this game to demo a new type of review for me: First Impression Reviews, where I've only played a game for not too long. These reviews will be different in structure than my typical score-based reviews, and will be considerably shorter. They may or may not be extended to a full-length review at a later date.\n\nSorry, I forgot to put quotation marks around the word "game" in the above paragraph. Because this, in its current state, can hardly be considered a game. This was incredibly disappointing, despite the overwhelming hype (no doubt generated by a free key for a vote promotion). In the few minutes I played this I quickly realised I exhausted all the content thus far. Almost everything is there just for show. While cows do explode (a factual inaccuracy pointed out to me, I apologise) - that alone is rather ludicrous and unnecessary. I suppose it could pass off as a cheap thrill since there are few to be had here. The grass art assets are 2D, and for a game that touts itself as a "grass simulator", that's a terrible disappointment.\n\nYou also cannot exit out of multiplayer mode. You're stuck in it and have to manually quit the game. Servers are likewise empty.\n\nI could go on and on but I'm already starting to get cancer from this super-super-super-alpha-tech demo. At least this has cards.\n\nGame Status: Released out of Early Access on April Fool's Day. Are you freaking kidding me? Still way too early.\n\nRecommended: Yes/NO\nNot even worth it at its current state or price point.

I want to firstly say It's just a joke, but I'm sure jokes are meant to be funny whereas I couldn't even smile while playing this game, It's a buggy unoptimised mess. I get that It's in early access, but I feel it should be placed in an even earlier access for the amount of content for what you get, and I understand the phrase "You get what you pay for" but I'm feeling a bit undercut here. This is several dollars on the side of uncomfortable for a game purchase, I've seen better flash games that had more time and effort put into them. So I spawned into a world filled with cheap unity assets and horrible textures and I hit a cow, the cow went boom, calm down Grass Simulator save some of the fun for later, I think I just overdosed on fun and exitement, I don't know what explosive beef and automatic weapons have to do with grass but maybe I'm just missing the big picture here. I decided to play the mode where you actually get to play as grass, I thought maybe the game has something to offer, maybe this is the big dog's biscuit, maybe I've uncovered the fountain of youth. Nope, you are a piece of grass, you grow, you stand there indefinitely, while my brain and eyes were still crying for me to stop, I decided to try the dubstep mode, now I can add my ears to the things that are being tortured. I think releasing the game with no download files would have been less of a mistake, at least then it wouldn't turn your computer into hot molten slag. You know what? For this once, I'd like to present the "MoWah's Longstanding Achievment Award for Detestable Mess of the 21st Century" to Grass Simulator, where It will hold it until they make a cross-breed of Grass Simulator, ET for the atari 2600 and Ride to hell.","December 21, 2014","false","11.4"," 47 of 59 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","47","59","2","3"

You could sit down and watch paint dry and get the same amount of entertainment as this game holds for much more time. this is just another game that somehow got greenlighted and onto the steam store in early access (and will never leave early access). It's really nice that Valve is doing something about games like these and providing actual quality control, but for now this one game is still here to ♥♥♥♥ up the store.\ni was fortunate enough to get this title for free in the christmas bidding event. i didn't spend a penny on this, but others did, and that thought alone makes me feel sorry.\n\nThe author made badges in the game, and the emotes are just memes like Gr8 and M8, nothing to do with the game and only mean't to get people to pay a lot for those two emotes to be funny for a few seconds, then remember they paid 5$ for an emote. while the emotes that have something to do with the game go for 3 cents.","December 15, 2014","false","0.9"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","33","37","0","0"

There are several modes, but not really anything to do in most. You'll be lucky to squeeze 1-2 hours out of it. The multiplayer mode is useless, as there are never any lobbies open. You can create one, but no one is ever online to play. Additionally, the performance is poor. Alone on a multiplayer map with graphics on 'Fastest' I get marginally better FPS than Battlefield 3 with 64 players on Intel graphics. The guns feel and sound weak, though they are vastly improved from the single player guns. The controls can be painfully awkward and are not rebindable. To quit multiplayer I have to Alt+Tab and close it as I cannot find an option to return to the menu or quit the game.  Finally, the Grass Simulating mode has the worst graphics of any mode, featuring 2D 'sprites' rather than 3D models of grass (this is most noticeable with the green silhouette of corn.)\n\nDespite the updates the game has received, essentially no significant improvements to individual modes have been made as far as I can tell. New modes get added, and nothing gets fixed. Despite a HUD and all guns being fully animated in multiplayer, the single player modes still have unfinished animations for guns and no hud at all.\n\nPerhaps someday, if the dev is willing to fix and expand existing modes instead of randomly adding new ones, the game may end up ok. However, until that day comes I advise you stay clear of Grass Simulator.\\\n\nV0.2.1 Update:\nJust performance fixes and maybe(?) some bugfixes. No new content. Multiplayer still ugly and empty (fun fact: it's impossible to use up all your ammo in a match.)  At least if you now find yourself playing Grass Simulator it will run better.\n\nV0.2.2 Update:\nMAIN MENU BUG FINALLY FIXED. You can properly change game modes now. Unless you start multiplayer, then you have to restart the game. :/\nNew mode, Hellfire, replaced the 'Grass' mode. It's effectively 'Classic' mode but with f.lux set to darkroom and some reskinned guns. Also, and I believe this is new in this version, weapon recoil is more severe. Weirdly, only the gun model moves-your bullets still go to the same spot and the camera fails to move, creating a weird look. I noticed the Glock sounds like it has a suppressor in Hellfire mode, and Classic, Hellfire [and I assume Snowfall as well] now have infinite ammo for all guns. The infinite ammo was implemented incorrectly, however, and you now never need to reload. Cow hit boxes are wrong as well.\n\nWhile it was nice to see an update that actually addressed problems and attempted to add 'new' content, I still cannot recommend this game to anyone.","April 17, 2015","false","22.1"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","34","40","2","6"

But then along comes someone who is so daft, that they decide to create a 'simulator' game on the most unimaginative thing possible. Grass.\n\nFunny one, I thought it was actually about Grass for a moment there! Wait, is it?\nNot exactly. You play as some sort of antagonist, poised to destroy every Cow on the face of the Earth. (It makes a whole lot more sense when you play it yourself trust me) However, there is a mode where you physically play as a blade of grass... AN ACTUAL BLADE OF GRASS.\n\nI legitimately spent £5 on this piece of ♥♥♥♥, what do I do with my life?\nWell, one thing you can do is sell your cat and your mother to make up for the £5 you unwillingly spent for this pile of toss.

I am not one of those people who blast a game after playing it for 35 minutes, but trust me on this one, in 35 minutes I checked out every single thing this game had to offer.\n\nThere is no story, no intro, no video, no cutscene, no dialog at all. Just the obnoxious music at the start screen. You start Classic mode, to find yourself in a random field with cows (wooden, low geometry idle models) grazing grass made up of 2-D models that will remind you of Midtown Madness (the 1999 game by MS). If you name a game Grass Simulator, for the love of Cthulhu, at least render the freaking grass nicely! And to think that THIS maxed out my decent laptop system at second-best graphics quality (fell below 30fps). What is it using the memory for? Definitely not rendering anything in the game!\n\nOkay, so you're in the field. Now what? You have a crosshair in the center of the screen - that's all. Since this is obviously not your first game, you click around buttons, and realise that number keys bring up different weapons. You can shoot cows with a Glock, an old-timey Revolver, a Tommy-Gun, and apparently what looks like a swinging mace. After 3-4 bullets the cows explode. That's it. The worst part, is that the budgeoning mace ironically does no damage. The "world", i.e., the random field, has invisible borders you can't cross (but your bullets can) and there is no map, no HUD, nothing at all that can tell you where you are and what, if anything, are you supposed to do. Oh, and there are no Ammo indicators, it just runs out when it wishes.\n\nNext is the "Grass" mode, where you can be a strand of grass on the ground, and can see the Sun set and rise every few seconds, seeing up close the pathetic 2-D grass models around you grow in height as days go by. I don't know if this bit was some satire on the overdose of crappy, mindless simulator games flooding social media, but this is truly pointless. Also, satire works best if there is something of use to complement it. Someone tell that to the Devs.\n\nThen there's a Dubstep mode, where some groovy music plays and you have cows spazzing in circles about their fixed axes. You can just watch the light-and-sound show, walk around and watch cows flashing in bright colours rotating to trippy music that repeats every 2.5 mins. The Bad Disco mode is a worse version of the same, with series of glowing disco lights replaced by the cow models. Frankly, seeing this does give you a laugh for the first 20 seconds, but after the joke is over you kinda wonder why the hell this game exists\n\nThe Snow Forest is actually a decent-looking stage which again clearly shows that the trees are much better-designed than the grass. Again, you have guns and you shoot cows to explode them.\n\nMy absolute crappy experience was the Range: There are targets for you to shoot. That's it. No count, no score, no ammo indicator.\n\nThroughout the game's various levels, you:\n-Can't switch to guns if you die. Gotta reboot the game (oh yes!);\n-May randomly just die, while walking or standing (I even died randomly in the Range); of course, no guns IF you manage to respawn;\n-Exploding cows, if too close to you, push you back and their explosions are lethal (no health bar whatsoever);\n-Might face a simple crash;\n-Might face the game's level loading but you freezing, with the Menu still functional.\n\nI had chanced upon this game in Greenlight, and voted yes because the idea seemed new, hilarious and really satirical. But the game has absolutely nothing in it. I expected something like Goat simulator, maybe. What I got was an 800 MB download that basically consisted of 2 MP3 files, 2 terrain models, 1 animal model, 4 weapon models, 2 tree models and maybe 5-6 grass PNGs. I later came to know that if the game got through Greenlight, the Devs would gift a key to those in the group following the game. They did not ask anyone to promote the game in any way, and the group was closed, so I don't know how ethical this whole deal was, but I am pretty sure that shady releases like these are a major reason why the Greenlight system got shut down. If I am feeling so bad over spending less than an hour, and a little bandwidth, I cannot imagine the plight of those who shelled out 10 Euros for this piece of absolute defecation.","June 4, 2015","false","0.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Unfortunately this hasn't happened.\n\nClassic mode: I shot cows. The clipping on the cows is either bad or they take many, many hits to kill. I had no idea if I was hitting them as they continued to ignore me. I shot the cows on the other side of the fence, or tried to as the bullets created holes in the air on the fence. Classic mode makes the grass feel like a sideline. This mode is more Explody-cow-shooting Simulator.\n\nGrass mode: where you watch grass textures and tree models get pushed up through the ground just like in real life.\n\nDubstep mode: I'm not entirely certain what the purpose of this mode is. Maybe I just don't get it because I'm not down with the kids and their Skrillex.\n\nRange mode: this wouldn't even work for me.\n\nSnow mode: again, this wouldn't work. I couldn't move or look around.\n\nIt's a novelty simluator, but not a good one. However, if I were to give you one good point, its that Alt + F4 works like a charm.\n","December 26, 2015","false","0.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I can surely say that this is one heck of a game. The story seems to be a bit linear, I believe that if the community gives ideas, we can make the game bigger and better. We cannot leave a game as beautifully crafted as this be left a waste.\n\nI guess I'll go through all the game modes:\n\nClassic Mode\nWell this is the firstmode I started out with and oh boy, did the plot move quickly. Fast paced and totally bonkers. This is the game mode I had the most fun with and honestly I don't think this mode needs much improvement. It's good as it is.\n\nDubstep Cow Mode\nA pretty meh game mode. I feel as if they just wanted to jump on the whole Dubstep mainstream bandwagon. I'm not saying its all bad, its enjoyable. Pretty entertaining. Although I do feel, even without this game mode, the game would still be amazing. This is also my least played mode, due to me just not liking it much.\n\nGrass Simulation Mode\nWow. That's all I can really say. This is stunning. Never have I ever thought of what it's like being grass. This is truly breath taking and I really feel like I'm in tune with my own lawn! It's really astonishing, how much the developers put so much work into making this a true next gen experience. The graphics seemed to have been pushed to the limits on this mode. I really didn't expect much from this game, but golly, was I wrong assuming this was going to be bad. This is a really innovative game mode and I just sometimes play it in order to feel being grass. The sheer excitement of growing as another object, just brings several tears to my eyes.\n\nSnowfall\nAlthough not as graphically intensive as the Simulation Mode. This mode is really pushing the limits. Exploration is key in this mode, this is the mode where the plot gets pushed further and further until the end. The scenery is breath taking and just being there makes me feel cold. I feel as if I am in the videogame.\n\nMultiplayer\nN/A\n\nBad Disco\nN/A\n\nI would love if the developer continued the story, although not in such a linear way, in a sequel? Grass Simulator 2?\n\nSorry for my bad English.","January 2","true","76.4"," 11 of 34 people (32%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","32","11","34","17","12"

You see yourself in infancy, and as you watch the grass grow you become wiser, and older. I feel that grass simulator shows that YOU are the grass, and  you are just one grass sapling in a whole field of grass, you grow with the grass, you die with the grass. The cows in this game symbolise society slowly eatting away at you (the grass) and everyone else you know who are also grass.

This game has many other features like the 7 levels of graphics that change nothing. This game has enlightened my experience in MOBA's and RTS and MMORPG's as it teaches me stratigies on killing cows who eat my grass even though there is no eating animation; You just beat them with clubs until they blow up and disappear mysteriously.

Honestly, I don't know what most of the reviewers were expecting- it's a GRASS SIMULATION GAME.  Even so, it actually goes above and beyond just being a grass simulator. Of course there is the grass simulation mode, which is genuinely relaxing with beautiful music and soft, relaxing sound effects. It's perfect for relaxing after a long, stressful day.\n\nIf you need more excitement, there are several other modes which have everything from dancing disco cows to the ability to shoot things to a snowy exploration level.\n\nAs a fan of simulation games, I genuinely recommend this game. The devs keep adding new things and it definitely gives you a genuine grass simulation experience.","February 8","true","7.9"," 3 of 17 people (18%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","18","3","17","3","3"

I did not get far before my body had completely shut down from exposure. Luckily I was found and managed to reach a hospital before the exposure managed to kill me.\n\nUpon recovery I was under 24-hour surveillance to ensure I did not go near the field again - a fact that plunged me into depression even further.\nIt was upon the 2nd of April, 2015 that I planned to take my life again where, by luck, I noticed the release of "Grass Simulator" on Steam. Fearful it would not match my preconceptions of grass, I bought and installed the game.\n\nGrass Simulator provided me a rich and beautiful simulation of how playing in the fields was to my friends and, I daresay, saved my life. So I thank the creator of this game. You have saved my life, but think of how many others you have saved, who have not spoken up.\n\nThank you.\nGrass Simulator - 10/10","April 10, 2015","true","1.3"," 173 of 484 people (36%) found this review helpful 321 people found this review funny","36","173","484","321","18"

This is an experience.\n\nIn my few short minutes of play time I was exposed to vast open worlds simllar to that of Skyrim or The Forest, I could roam frozen wastelands and green pastures alike in my search to find Cow Jesus and bring him back to the light.\n\nAfter Cow Jesus ascended back to Cow Heaven during Dubstep Mode, I took it upon myself to be the next saviour of cowkind and seek out someone who could take up his mantle. I encountered many cows with powers in my travels, but they were simply unwilling to become a saviour like the great Cow Jesus was. Infuriated, I opened fire on the cows with my arsenal of firearms and was struck down by Cow Jesus. I was thrown several meteres into the air and died. However, I was forgiven by Cow Jesus, for he is a great and merciful God, although he was unwilling to save my shattered legs, causing me to trip every few steps as I continued my search for a cow who could lead all other cows to salvation. I walked across water, scaled the highest mountains and even slowed down time during my quest.\n\nPerhaps you will succeed where I have failed. Perhaps you will succeed in the lastest mode, the mode they call "Oh Lord". I was weak and unable to finish the quest, and fell to the deepest depths of Cow Hell where I saw the holy trinity of Cow God, Cow Jesus and The Holy Cow mocking me from their sanctuary in the sky.\n\nI pray you will not be put off by all the negative reviews and will take up my quest so that Cow Jesus can rise once again in Dubstep mode.\n\nCow God speed my son.\n\n11/10","February 10, 2015","true","0.7"," 20 of 247 people (8%) found this review helpful 47 people found this review funny","8","20","247","47","0"

If you like watching paint dry, then what in the world are you waiting for? BUY THIS MASTER PIECE!!!!!\nThis game emerges you into a Farmer's paradise. With being able to weild a tommy gun, and shoot at cows that will never die, even if they are in the ground wanting you to put them out of their missery. I mean, for only $8 you could buy 8 double cheese burgers from Mic-♥♥♥♥♥. OR, you could get this game. Cause, God knows this game is WAY more important than eating, am I right? Cause, I know I am. Anyways, if you are short on cash, and have to choose between this and food, starve. You will have hours of enjoyment, along with only like an hour of enjoyment at tops while eating. Plus, you could die from starvation, and be happy that you tried out this God send of a game.

There's just so much to say.Grass Simulator is, simply put, the best single-player games ever released for the PC. It does so many things right in so many ways that it might be possible to write a thesis on the topic of Grass Simulator compared to other games. What Daniel Davies has created is simply a masterpiece -- a work of art in the genre. Not only does it engage the mind with mysterious happenings, vagaries, and mostly intelligent dialogue, but also captures the senses with a superb visual style made possible by brilliant technology. And once the initial shock of it all wears off and it becomes possible to peel back the polished layers of sight and sound, there is an excellent FPS here. Grass Simulator doesn't do anything particularly new; it doesn't really innovate in many ways. But what it does is set a new height for all other designers of video games to reach. It still isn't exactly perfect, but it's about as close as I've seen.","November 15, 2014","true","3.7"," 30 of 300 people (10%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","10","30","300","0","13"

AM I BACK?!  IS IT OVER?!\n\nI am...I think...my first vision after coming back was exactly as I suspected:  a Steam window asking me to write a review of Grass Simulator, AN EXPERIENCE I CAN ONLY BRIEFLY DESCRIBE AS TRANSCENDENTAL\n\nThere I was, in Dubstep mode, scratching my head and wondering if I could come up with an even lazier method for acquiring quick cocaine cash than the developer, when one of the tiny dancing cows turned to me and spoke my name, but not in a language of this world...\n\n...it felt like a thousand cockroaches had scurried up my spine and escaped out of the hairs on the back of my neck...\n\nA small black dot then appeared at the center of my screen and began expanding more rapidly than I could realize that this was not happening in the game.\n\nThe blackness enveloped me on all sides.  It felt like the blackness had then started to infiltrate my mind. The universe spun and any attempts at rationalizing what was happening just led to a combination of worsening confusion and schizophrenic popping noises in my brain like all the pneumatic and hydraulic fittings connecting my neurons were bursting.  An overwhelming vibrating nausea seemed to take over every organ in my body and the urge to expel this violent soup inside me was unbearable.  Something was taking control and it was not about to let me protest.  I felt like I was being...stirred...\n\nI can't describe how long I endured this.  I could fathom eternity because I had no grasp of anything else.  My bones felt like uranium and my senses had eventually vanished.  My conscience had become a singularity that I could somehow gaze into but would recoil away from in horror.  When I somehow put some comfortable distance between me and my own conscience, a voice spoke to me in inhaled, reversed gasping whispers.  It felt like a language that only I could understand and seemed like was being conceived and conducted on the fly just for me.  The ethereal fingers of the voice articulated its message in what felt like a maddening thousand years for me to decipher:\n\n"Eight dollars ninety-nine.  Now don't you feel silly?  Go now, and warn the others."\n\nHere I sit now where the Sun's warmth through my window feels like I've been thawed out of a glacier.  Where the distant boom-boom-PSSHT of my neighbor's awful hip hop sounds like a symphony that took a lifetime to compose.  Where the crumbs at the bottom of my bag of Cheetos taste like nourishment that could cure all the world's hunger.  Where typing on this keyboard feels like I'm speaking to the world for the very first time.\n\nWhere knowledge is abundant, and love is all that really matters.\n\nSo do it, dear reader.  Buy Grass Simulator, endure it to the demise and violent reimagining of your being, and then find some reason to care again.  Feel inescapable loss and then rapturous triumph.  Eat some fruit.  Hug your mother.  Wash your damn car.  Man up and ask that girl out already.  Try to pretend that this life means something because now you understand what nothing is.\n\nLIVE MY NIGHTMARE, BECOME GOD, AND THEN TELL THE UNIVERSE TO GO ♥♥♥♥ ITSELF","November 13, 2014","true","0.1"," 27 of 392 people (7%) found this review helpful","7","27","392","0","5"

An avid Steam user, always checking out the latest and greatest of titles. Then I stumbled upon a game, known as Grass Simulator. Being in the 2012 "YOLO" mode, I said "♥♥♥♥ it" and bought the game. My life changed forever. I witnessed many things in Grass SImulator; what is seen cannot be unseen. I saw cows, ravaging the land, houses in the woods, and even a firing range. But truly the most interesting thing to behold was the Dubstep Cow. A rare mythical beast, I stumbled upon while making my journey through the Grasslands. This beast had charmed hundreds, if not thousands of other cows to do its bidding, and I knew I had to put an end to it. Holding my fists up high, I charged in, and as my fist collided with the cow it exploded into a burst of light. I thought the battle was over; I was wrong. Deep inside I felt the beat, my heart racing to the rhythm. The demon had fled inside me, and now I could not get the drone of Dubstep out. Before I could react my mind was thrust away, and I lost control of my body. I could simply watch through dead eyes as my corpse was lifted up high, and the sounds of dubstep shrieked out of me. I spent 5 years wandering the globe with the cow. We invaded city and country; home and land, and soon had an unstoppable force of slaves from every species. We came across a sattelite used to send sounds into deep space. Since that day the cow is in control of most of the Milky Way and parts of Andromeda. This is my, nay, our life.\n\nIf I had the choice to buy this game again? Hell yeah. For the first 15 minutes it was great, until it, you know, destroyed humanity.","November 13, 2014","true","2.2"," 18 of 376 people (5%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","5","18","376","6","3"

Part of the "joke" is that it is not a game.  Games offer some sort of enjoyment to the human being interacting with them.  There is no redeeming qualities for this title.  Save your money, and if someone gifts it to you, return it to them.  The "game" Air Control is better than this.  I would rather step in cat feces than have this in my library.  If you have a steam friend, and this game is in their library with more than a few hours of game play, I would advise removing them from your list, and even blocking them entirely.","January 25","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As far as I'm aware, you can't run out of ammo, you can't get hurt, you can't shoot things that isn't cows (they explode) or targets. And how is it a grass simulator when the grass doesn't grow, do anything or even looks much like grass. Might as well call Team Fortress 2 House Simulator, or Portal Wall Simulator.","June 6","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
