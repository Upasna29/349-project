Tremendous fun to play with friends, though it always ended up pure fight between friends lol. The graphic is old-schooled and if you are a video game generation who enjoyed all the goods from 90's would love this game. I think those who have no memory of old days still can have much fun to play because there are lots of characters, special moves, and it's really fun to play with. Definitely recommend this game anyone who wants to play old style super smash bro-like game!","December 17, 2015","true","1.9"," 44 of 62 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","44","62","5","0"

Each character can also have special attack moves.\n\nThere are 4 types of sporting events including Cross Country, Obstacle Relay, Camphor ball and Battle Royal. The first two are pretty much the same except obstacle relay obviously includes obstacles. Camphor ball is a game where you need to beat the oppenent in climbing a pole to reach a ball in which you punch till it breaks. Battle Royal is a fighting arena where you fight other contestants. In all of these events you are able to hit the oppenents during any stage of the game to hinder or even eliminate your oppenent from the round. There is defienetly some fun to be had in each of these modes.\n\nOne of the greatest features of this game is that you are able to customise almost anything to your liking. This paired with a quite impressive story line with many hilarious scenes starring familiar characters gives the game an authentic feel.\nA big part of the game is playing through and unlocking teams, characters, special moves to use in your arsenal and this is quite dragging in it self, but essential.\n\nThe most significant downside to this otherwise enjoyable game is the fact that the rules are too convoluted and contrived. I'll show why by dissecting a race. For starters, the screen doesn't advance until all players reach the end of it. Upon entering the next screen, each combatant starts in the position that they finished the previous screen in. Therefore, you really only need to try during the final screen in which any player can easily claim victory. You get points according to how well you placed but you also collect them throughout the race by such actions as beating up other players. This means that you can "win" a race flawlessly only to discover that you actually lost because the player in last place beat up more people than you. It's a confusing mess with no clear method that guarantees success. Additionally, the poorly translated text is a chore to understand. If you can't grasp how to play then good luck trying to decipher the instructions.\n\nRiver City Super Sports Challenge: All Stars Special is a game that'll feel right at home for fans of the Kunio-kun series. Although it's not the best of the bunch, it has enough redeeming qualities to not make fans "Barf!" with disappointment.[\h1]\n\nOn a quick end note, i do find this game to be a bit pricey for its release. My initial decision was to suggest this game as a "Recommended steam sale purchase" but due to my love for the series and nostalgic NES memories i have marked this as a "Recommended buy".","December 17, 2015","true","0.6"," 37 of 60 people (62%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","62","37","60","5","0"

It's also the same button for pausing the game. Also if you ever played Nintendo World Cup during your childhood, you oughta look into this game.\n\nWarning! If you don't want any spoilers, avoid reading this review until you have seen/played the game yourself!\n\n\n\nSo River City Super Sports Challenge All Stars Special AKA River City Ransom x Sports is a beat em up game with sports modes in them. As a River City Ransom fan, the game keeps what makes the series fun to the BARF and Street Fighter-like moves with a mix of 4 modes/games you and your team will experience. Game comes with Story Mode, Free Mode, Online mode and customization.\n\nGameplay\n2 to 4 teams (normally 4) contest each other in a competition consisting of 6 characters for each team. For each event, you are to pick 1 member from your squad and use him/her for that event. Your goal is to simply win as many events or points as possible in these events. At the end, the team with the most points wins.\n\nThe combat is pretty much what you expect from River City Ransom games: punch, kicks, hit others with wacky normal day items like WWE. The twist is that depending on which event you play it's either focused on running or beating up rivals. During the running events (Cross Country and Obstacle Course), you are encouraged to finish 1st place in many sections of the course to obtain highter points. Your punch and kicks would be more on palm pushing or elbow back hits to either slow your enemy down or reduce their HP to 0. However, you are allowed to use special moves to spice up the game to your favour if used wisely. Good news is that EVERY character has their own 2 special moves that have their uses. What's better is that there are TONS of special moves so you will have fun trying them out in curiosity (and remembering).  Here are events you will expect:\n\nCross Country (running mode) : Get most points by reaching the end of every section of the track. It also has wind to slow or speed you up sometimes.\n\nObstacle Course (running mode) : Same as Cross Country but the course is more focused on enviromental hazards and elements  such as treadmills, holes, spikes, a bit of platforming, etc. If you know that TV show Wipeout, this is pretty much like it.\n\nCamphor Ball: The course is more like a tag team battle of 2 vs 2  (friendly fire is applied here) where both teams must climb or reach the big ball hanging on top and damage it until it opens to obtain victory.\n\nBattle Royale: Nuff said. It's last man standing.\n\nSurprisingly you are like the coach asking which player would be most suitable for the event in terms of their stamina/HP and special moves. It gives a tiny bit of strategic value in choosing who has the better chance of doing well in the event. (That is, if you're good at controlling them too). Some are meant for running and agility, others are brawlers and great at kicking others in the nuts so know your team!\n\nSo that's pretty much what you expect from gameplay. I do wish there are more events but I find all 4 to be really enjoyable especially the fact they all have different varieties of courses and tracks to pit you in. Other than that, the gameplay keeps what makes River City Ransom itself with a mix of sports.\n\nGraphicsI admire the mix of nostalgia and 3D enviromental graphics here. Characters are in the form of pixel/sprites just like the NES days of River City Ransom. The background is more of a 3D graphic which pleases the eye though I have heard of issues with it from other players. My laptop has no problem with it so therefore, it's a fantastic mix.\n\nControlsRemember when I stated the M button on top? Yeah, this is the game's first problem. The game's controls is playable and smooth but the button keys are super confusing for some. M for start and pause is an odd key to use and you punch, jump and kick with only 3 buttons: J, O and U. I find this setting to be very weird which might not please some trying to get used to it. Thankfully in the Options menu, you can switch which keys for which role. Downside is...you're only limited to J, O and U keys. At least once you get used to the keys, you can still play the game without having problems doing special moves.\n\nMusicSurprisingly some are remixes of some of themusic of the River City Ransom games and spin-offs which actually fits the game. Bonus points for nostalgia.\n\nReplayability and customizationNow this is where the big part comes in. The game has a feature for you to customize your own character, River City Ransom NES sprite style. You get to customize the name, hair and face. For clothes, there's only like 3 or 4 of them but at least you get to choose the colours too for all. Best part is when you get to choose almost EVERY special moves for your character which brings more replayability to the table as well. From Shoryuken to a throwing homing item attack, the special moves are what keeps you addicted. Heck, some special moves are (sadly) limited to certain characters in free mode which encourages you to try them all. The special moves can be executed in the form of punch, kick, item, throwing, mid-air attacks, etc. IT'S RIVER CITY RANSOM!\n\nYou also get to create a team of your own as well as create your own set of stages though they are just adding sections of the course and switching the order. But it's still fun if you want to have a bit of a challenge.\n\nOverall, this game being the first River City Ransom game on Steam will definitely please those that are into the series and those that are into beat em up. The game is very fun for a beat em up both casuals and fans of it. I'm grateful even though the English translation isn't top notch, it's enough to satisfy me and understand the mechanics of the game.\n\nI recommend you buy it or wait for a little discount if it's not your price. But it's still a great game nonetheless! Any questions you can ask me in case.\n\nAnd if you're interested, River City Ransom Underground just got Greenlighted on Steam! Go check it out if you love this beat em up series!","February 21","true","23.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","1"

Also the story is funny if you are familiar with the japanese school delinquits.\nWhere it falls short is the unfamiliarity of controlls and how the game works.\nThere are 5 pages of move sets you can do and you can only select 2 of them to use while in competition, however how to execute these moves is only posible to see in the main menu. So you basically have to exit and restart the game to look it up if you forget. It gets worse as you have to use 5 different characters on your team and each one has a different set of special moves.","December 19, 2015","true","11.5"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","2"

I really don't know how they took such a simple formula and screwed it up this badly.\n\nPros:\n* Nostalgia\n\nCons:\n* "Full Controller Support" does not actually mean your controller will be supported.  Expect to use your keyboard.\n* An action game with undocumented controls you have to guess.  It took me a couple minutes to get past the intro screen because it didn't occur to me "Press Start" meant the "U" key.  I wasn't even sure the game was registering my keyboard until I hit Escape and the game closed.\n* Somewhat unresponsive controls.\n* The keybindings options only let you remap Punch (a.k.a. Start), Jump, and Kick, so you can't even use that page to find out what all the other buttons are.\n* There is no documentation with this game (either in instructions or walk-throughs) for anything else, either.\n* Each event has unique controls, which (as mentioned) aren't told to you.\n* Race competitions don't make it clear where you have to go so the only way to become faster at them is to memorize what the game should have told you.  Oh, the right arrow meant "Go up to the door" rather than "Go right" like all of the other times?  Thanks, Game.\n* I only got through 3 of the 4 competitions before I just gave up, but all of them felt really slow.\n* Many competitions make it feel like your character is perpetually running in sand.   It's also unclear how you run faster or why you wouldn't run faster.\n* Still don't know how to swim faster.  Did I mention the game doesn't tell you what the buttons are or how to do things?\n* Many of the thrown weapons fly entirely differently than each other, and since the first two competitions are races, you don't exactly get to practice using them.\n* Only the computer can punch people while swimming (as far as I can tell, since none of the attack buttons I know actually do anything while swimming).\n\nNot Applicable:\n* I did not get around to multiplayer.","January 10","false","0.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Hopefully they put sweat and tears into this game, because I would love this game if there wasn't a couple of issues I have. First, I can only get a xbox 360 controller to support this game, but I haven't put much research into it, so there could be a fix. Second, were is the online play? I make a room and wait 20 min with no one showing up. I join a room and get the same effect. Third, there is no way to quit a match. I have to hit windows key, and close process to stop the game, even in single player. Fourth, in single player there is way to much dialogue, I can hit x like 20 times every 10 sec, and I still have to wait for this damn dialogue. Make a freaking skip feature for god sake, the first time is alright, but everytime I play single player? There is no replay value I  dont want to have to go through each cut scene again. This is coming from a 80s child, so Im not just ♥♥♥♥♥ing. Crash And The Boys Street Challenge kills this game. Back in the day with the four paddle hook up extension, and the old nes. Damn, I cry sitting here in 2015 thinking of the good old days. I still have the game, but I can't get anyone to play it with me at 32 years old. :(:(","December 24, 2015","false","1.0"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","4","12","0","0"
