The RTS part is really limited, but still most of the game is really fun. It has a REALLY elaborated plot, one of thouse plots that make a gamer like me go online searching for more about the story. I just didn't end this game because it is really really long (what I guess is a good thing). At some point of the game I already had some of the best items and most skills but the story just wouldn't come to an end.\n\nThe biggest flaws in here is the RTS part of game, that is really limited and simplistic, and specially the fact that that the game is quite buggy (some major bugs might even prevent you from continuing some quests).\n\nThe best part of it is the plot and the combat system. It's kind of hard at first, but once you get used to this different combat mechains you will really enjoy it.","December 12, 2013","true","64.5"," 44 of 47 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","44","47","0","0"

Throw in a wealth of online options-most notably cooperative play-and you have sleeper hit in the making.An ambitious effort, and a definite success. Conveying an interesting story with beautiful graphics, great voice acting, a nice soundtrack, and a tight control scheme, very few flaws are to be found in SpellForce 2.This game is sure to satisfy action-RPG gamers.","April 27, 2014","true","9.8"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","46","51","0","0"

However, the quests , item stats and character/map graphics left much to be desired. These flaws have been very much fixed in Spellforce 2. Although the story was not as good as in Spellforce 1, it still sucks you in and drives you to play trough the whole campaign. The multiplayer would be enjoyable if there where more players, and if the resources would slowely regenerate as they did in Spellforce 1. This way they could be protected, adding more tactics to the game. The talent trees have been overhauled as well, forcing you to choose a certain path, which was not the case in Spellforce 1. All in all I would recommend it mainly because of the story, lore and character designs.","July 29, 2014","true","22.7"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"

The units of each faction are interesting, although I feel there could be one or two extra per faction.\nA minor criticism is that, unlike more modern RTS, it does not make use of cover or terrain.

If you liked Spellforce 1 you will also enjoy this one.\n\nUnfortunately the story is not as good as in Spellforce 1 and they combined the different races into three different alliances, limiting the amount of titans to just three. I can't deny that I missed summoning three titans at once to strengthen my army, but the new titans are well designed and very strong. Seeing that they can turn the tides of a battle gives you sweet satisfaction or despair if it's the enemy ;-)\n\nI like the new hero system. They abandoned the rune system and give you permanent fellows instead, which you can skill to your own liking, at least to some point. A simple base orientation is forced upon them to keep the story consistency. Sadly they cut down the magic spells a little bit and removed all permanent auras.\nSomething important that I almost forgot; they added mounted and flying units granting you more strategical possibilities, unfortunately they don't have massive dis-/advantages over other unit types, like it is the case in The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-Earth. Of course there are counterunits, but no real annhilators. (Damn I loved to run down some goblins with my Rohirims, but those phalanx carrier were really scary^^)\nFor those of you, who got tired of all the walking in Spellforce 1, fear not Spellforce 2 is much better in this matter.\n\nThe addon is also worth playing and comes with a fourth playable faction.\nIn conclusion: You should play this game, I'm certain you will enjoy it, even if you still prefer Spellforce 1, that's what I do.","July 17, 2013","true","79.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

After playing the Order of Dawn and the expansions several times; I got interested in the unique gameplay and the world of Eo.\n\nHowever this game changed the mechanics of the gameplay and the way you play it, for example, you no longer play as a rune warrior in the campaign but instead you’re a Shaikan, possessing dragon blood with similar features to a rune warrior without the power of using the monuments.\n\nThe gameplay no longer uses the monuments as a headquarters for army and base building, but now you build small towns from which you build your armies, and although I preferred the old gameplay this was also fun. Your heroes now level up with you, allowing further customization.\n\nInstead of managing the six nations like in the previous Spellforce, this one has 3 alliances in which you build armies, the Realm, the Pact and the Clans, the Dragon Storm campaign also adds the Shaikan faction.\n\nThe base building elements are fun to play like the previous game, but some aspects like the resources for the town and army management was superior in the Order of Dawn, they removed the buildings that doubled the resource income and the resources are on average very limited supply, this also presents more of a challenge because your enemies always possess huge amounts of resource deposits near their bases and you can use this to your advantage in some cases but also forces  you into more rushed tactics. The game also feature the Free game mode, allowing further gameplay and also a bit more challenging than the campaign.\n\nI enjoyed the Rune warrior gameplay more than the Shaikan, but I still liked this game. There were some issues with the camera bugs in the Shadow Wars campaign, but fortunately the Dragon Storm expansion was free of them.\n\nThe soundtrack is beautiful and fitting to the Spellforce Universe. The graphics are also some of the most good looking of the real time strategy genre.\n\nOverall, it is a good game and a fine sequel with some changes that might not please every gamer but it is a great addition to the universe.","March 25, 2015","true","60.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Let's start by saying, that I've played both main Spell Force games when I was much younger and it was great to remind myself why I enjoyed these games. It's very good combination of rpg and strategy. So why the negative review?\n\nWell... First of all, this game is better than the first one. I find it hard to believe that someone without sentiment towards first Spell Force would have a different opinion. Plot is solid, in both games, but Spell Force 2 has better graphic, better music and most importantly, better controls. It's also much better paced. You finally don't feel like you wasting eternity just going from one point on the map to another. It has aged much better that the first game, it's still very enjoyable, you don't get the feeling like the camera or characters movements are clunky. Strategic elements of the game were also improved. The only thing that I've enjoyed better in the first Spell Force was the fact, that it has definitely more freedom in terms of creating your own character.\n\nAs for Spell Force 2 itself...\n\nPros:\n+ interesting plot\n+ original and well done mix between strategy and rpg\n+ game is truly challenging\n+ great music\n+ interesting and useful spells/special abilities that unlocks when you level up\n\nCons:\n- low resolution\n- lack of truly interesting quests\n- gaining another level doesn't really feel that rewarding\n- pretty limited character creation\n- dialogue scenes are essentially broken - characters not always shows up or does not shows up properly\n- BUGS.\n\nYeah, I'm sorry, but how can you recommend a game that basically make you feel like you've wasted 16 hours of your life playing it? I am really understanding, I'm not the type of person who gets over frustrated and never wants to play a game after encountering a less or more serious bug. Sure, it's pretty annoying, but if it can be fixed somehow, if I can replay some sequences or just restart the whole mission, I'm still going to do this. So I've encountered few serious, game breaking bugs. Two times restarting missions worked. In other instance, skipping the dialogue was an only way to avoid being literally stuck in the void. And now... Well, now I actually can't finish my quest, because even though I've done everything that was needed to be done, even get a note in journal to go back to the person that is crucial for moving the plot forward... Well, this person does not want to talk to me. At all. There's no scene. No dialogue. Nothing. Replaying the sequence and the whole mission didn't work.\n\nMaybe this game works better on older systems (I don't remember having this sort of problems in the past), but with this amount of serious bugs it's not really worth a recommendation. Buy it only if you want to replay it or just remind yourself the whole series.","November 16, 2015","false","16.6"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","13","22","2","0"

And I have more than two hours in this because I'm a semi-completionist for those who are curious:\n\nTL;DR: Great concept of strategy rpg, but very buggy, very simple strategy, very basic rpg and some of the most obvious padding and Macguffins I've ever seen.\n\nThere is a game-breaking camera glitch. This glitch happens when certain cutscenes/dialogues end; your camera is forced to an awkward location, set looking at the sky or something. You cannot see the world and cannot therefore order units effectively or interact with quest objects. There is a patch that 'seems' to fix most instances, except the dwarven camp where I needed it to fix it. You can mash the space bar/escape button to rush through/skip dialogue. That seems to avoid the camera bug, but NPC behavior can get wonky, since sometimes (at least once) NPCs might need to spawn or despawn during cutscenes.\n\nAnother bug where you sacrifice 'light worshippers' and one of them doesn't walk properly. Going into 3rd person and bumping her seems to fix. But readers can see the game is buggy. This is all apparently because of the way they mashed two games together to make the 'Gold Edition'. Reminds me of what I've heard of the Homeworld re-releases: apparently not-breaking code during a copy-paste marathon is harder than it sounds... But I'll go onto the game itself now.\n\n\nThe story involves you getting reinforcements to stop an army and save your village/city. So you convince a count to give a letter of recommendation (LoR) to a baron, after saving the count from annihilation. You escort the count's son and some supplies to the baron, who you save from annihilation in return for a letter of recommendation to the king. The count's son escorts you to the king, who says 'no'. But there are others who might rally to the cause, you have to convince them to join and bash through the enemy's fortress from behind, because that is the only way back to the village you're trying to save. Through the attackers' main castle. There's a part where you have to wake a passed-out drunk dwarf. That involves a four-part quest with at least four NPCs. The word that describes this is tedious. Much of the plot is 'we need to go to X' but the only way to X happens to be through Y and Z levels. So out of 20 or so regions, 10 of them are padding and 5 or so more hold MacGuffins. Great.\n\nYou have armies, including semi-unique 'titan' units, which are as ROFL stomping-forgot your bubblegum-s**t just got real-as you'd expect. But I'd rather have the player become that way, well, eventually. For a little bit. Well, anyhow... The strategy element is kiiinda okay, except the difficulty is very arbitrary and base-building is very formulaic. Example: one mission you need to free captured orcs by beating a human base. Except, for no good reason there are giant spiders attacking your base constantly. And when you beat the humans you get surprised dialogue about 'the spiders are coming', suggesting the spiders should have only started spawning at this point. The game also feels like is was made with the Warcraft 3 map editor, with some voiceovers added.\n\nYou also get access to different cool races! But how this happens is the previous race that you can finally use with all their units, the race whose territories you just saved from annihilation or lead to impossible victory, they give you the finger and for no good reason your defeated foes now trust you to lead their forces. It's just a little better than "Message from the developers: you're going to play the next part of the game with this new race, starting from the ground up again. Have fun!"\n\nThere are other gripes, but this is my second REwrite of this review, so I'll leave the smaller things to others.","January 7","false","52.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

They integrates RPG and RTS well enough, but the controls are awkward as hell. With no obvious way of changing key bindings, as well as no way of automating any of your party members' tasks, the game becomes needlessly frustrating at times. The kindest way to describe the dialogue is "boring and bad, written by a simpleton with no grasp of the English language." And just to give me yet another thing to complain about, exploring or otherwise doing anything other than slavishly following orders can and will have horrible consequenses - except when it's arbitrarily rewarded. You never know if straying from the beaten path is going to lead to treasures or call down the wrath of the gods.\n\nThis, along with infrequent crashes, pointless and timewasting puzzles and a list of bugs that haunts my nightmares, does not make playing these games feel like a beta. It feels like funding a Nigerian royal in exile.\n\nDon't buy unless the price is at least 75% marked down.","March 26, 2011","false","52.7"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","12","24","0","0"

It's a great mix between RTS and RPG. The character progression has an old-school feel that gives the player a sense of ownership over the development of his/her party and the loot system meaningfully enhances the experience, giving players a tangible reason to fully explore and complete quests. The RTS elements are lacking, but the RPG elements make up for it.\n\nThe fact that the game is fun makes it all the more painful when you reach a point where you can't progress; the camera glitches, you can't properly move your character, enemies that are supposed to spawn don't spawn. There is no reasonable fix for this.\n\nTo quote another Steam user, "Nothing works. The game is bugged and the developers gave up on it. Move along."

So many changes were made that aside from the lore you would say that this is a different game.\n\nCons:\n1.\nCharacter building was made streamlined to the point of making it fool-proof. You can no longer choose attributes only skills ( which come equipped with said attributes in the armor/weapons they allow to use ).\n2.\nGame is not designed to allow retries organically like the 1st. If one of your heroes or your Character die a countdown starts during which you have to ress them with either your Character/hero or at a Life Shrine ( a player made building ) or its GAME OVER. ALSO THERE ARE OBJECTIVES YOU CAN FAIL WTF? I mean yeah sure the 1st game 2nd campaign had you escorting refugees which could be killed except for that one immortal named char but it was keeping in tone with the rest of the game up-to and after that point. I would rather take 1 escort mission with a sily immortal grandpa than Spellforce 2's escort horses,  on the bloody second map, for which the game can't be bothered to tell if they are being attacked. I guess  Falkmar is being passive aggressive.\n\n3.\nRaces also seem to have been streamlined. In your very first map you will notice in the new Headquarters building that  there are 3 upgrades named for the 3 Light races. Im sorry but squishing Human, dwarf and elf ( which were 3 distinctly different races if not much by gameplay then by buildings and resource requirements) into 1 race is painful dumbing down. Just because you can't be bothered to make large enough maps for all the buildings required in the previous game does not mean you can suddenly make a all in one building for 3 races ( I mean FFS in the 1st game's second campaign you learn that the elves and dwarfs fought and killed each other at one point).\n4.\nThis one is tied to 3. You seemingly only use 3 resources now........ Why? No seriously Why? Is it because of the 3 in 1 race thing. Dwarfs stopped using mithril and elfs stopped caring about trees? WTF is this?\n5.\nOne of the worst pathfinding I have ever seen in a RTS. Have a group of mounted archers attacking through a chokepoint? Get used to the idea that those damned horses will now block any other of your units getting in range, guess they take attack orders a bit too seriously.\n6.\nBUGS.\n\nOh and as a last F U to the player, even the music seems to be mimicking Lord of the Rings in the first few missions.

I bought it because I had been led to believe it is similiar to Warcraft 3, which is more or less true: There are heroes, and there are different races. I have not played the game for a considerable amount of time so I will not comment on the story.\n\nWhat I will comment on is what is probably the laziest programming I have ever seen in a game. The game has 3 modes:\nCampaign, where you play through the main story and can save at any time.\nFree mode, where you can play through other campaign-ish maps and custom campaigns at your leisure.\nAnd Skirmish mode, which is just straight-up RTS against bots or on Lan.\n\nHaving gotten over an hour and a half into the main campaign with barely any RTS whatsoever, I decided to try out skirmish mode. Imagine my surprise then, when, after hitting the menu key, I found there was NO SAVE FEATURE. This is also true of free mode. The insane thing is, after doing some digging, I found out that you CAN in fact save, but only through using the case-sensitive console built into the game. So the game is perfectly capable of saving, but apparently it was too much work to add a friggin save button. This is seriously the laziest thing I have EVER seen in a game from a major developer/publisher, especially since they've had years and years to patch it in.\n\nAs for the RTS part itself, it's rather simplistic, you build buildings to unlock units and you can make heroes. You can't upgrade any units and the hero skills seem horribly unbalanced. You're better off sticking to Age of Empires 2, Warcraft 3, or any of the other RTS/Strategy games if that's what you are looking for.","February 20","false","6.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Dear God has gaming changed since. No support for high resolutions, no support for widescreen, no improved graphics (it ran maxed when it came out), glitchy, and worst of all, WORST of all, absolutely crappy save management. A story-driven strategy game is supposed to have my back. It only auto-saves when you switch areas, which was 4 ♥♥♥♥ing hours ago, lost all my SevenKeeps progress. I got killed with cheats, because it loves to glitch and kill you even with god mode on.\n\nRage quit and uninstalled. I don't care how good it used to be, I am not playing the last 50 quests again. Don't bother with this game. Ir was a nice blend when it came out, now it's old and decrepit, not even rebuilt for Steam, it still requires a serial key as long as my arm.\n\nWhy? It's on torrents since 2006, what possible protection do you seek? I'm not saying patch your game if you sell it, you utter crooks, I'm saying crack it for steam. it's 2 bucks, nobody is stealing it. You still have the sources, disable key check, allow black-bar widescreen resolution and add some autosave every 5 minutes.\n\nI'm not talking crashed here, no I DIED AND LOST 4 HOURS OF PROGRESS. What is this, 1993?\n\nDon't buy it. It's slow, doesn't save, fast travel is stupidly implemented, quests are clunky, magic is underpowered and it's glitchy as heck (not because new hardware, it runs fine, it was always glitchy). Pathfinding is atrocious, units go on the wrong path and get lost. They go in knots for no reason and seem to just attempt to path 40 meters, then another 40, sometimes going in the wrong direction, completely losing sight of their final goal. In combat, this pathing issue is a b*tch, not to mention it has no polite/predictive pathing. If 4 units stop in the door, the others dance around, unable to pass though, around, push units whatever, and get slaughtered.\n\nJust buy something modern. Not worth it.

The heroes level up with you and gain skills, the military units are cannon fodder. That's the crux of it; not much depth here. It does, however, create a nice hybrid game in that you don't have to live and die by either your hero build, or your micro-managing skills as a strategy gamer.\n\nWhat Spellforce bills as a feature to make combat easy actually makes it tedious, but the amount of quick control it gives you is worth it. Once you're over the shock of having to click so many times to control your party, you'll find you can quickly dispatch many different units.\n\nThe story is on rails, so no replay value; but worth the pricetag if you like BOTH Baldur's and Warcraft.","March 3, 2011","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its story is  really good, and freemode is fun too, sometimes it may get boring, and stressful like when enemies are higher level than you, but its a really cool game. The one thing i noticed is that on the cd my uncle had, it had no bugs, and video cam never had errors. In this steam version of the game, It had errors with the camera every time, ruining the story. I still enjoy this game, and welcome other players to enjoy it as well. The bugs dont pop up often to me, ive only seen one in the amount of time i played, 13 hours, but the cam errors are often, if you can ingore these things, the game is a great experience. I honestly blame steam for the errors, Because on my uncles CD version, it never had these problems. Stil the game is fun, try it for your self, if you dont want to spend alot, you can wait for a sale. Thats what i did.
