"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arbco/recommended/218820/","arbco","Alien Rope Burn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arbco/","761 products in account","Let's start with the good stuff: Paul Robertson's sprite design is excellent. Much like Scott Pilgrim on the consoles, the character design is pretty sharp, and this is clearly a game he can cut loose on more that he did on Pilgrim. Of course, this also means his creative boxes of body horror and gore get checked more sharply, too.\n\nThe main issue is that this is marketed as a Metal Slug-style game, but has none of the speed or energy. Rather than rewarding a run 'n gun style, you often cautiously stop to take down tiresome enemies with shields (their strength is in trying to bore you to death) and their ilk. It honestly reminds me more of the slow pace of early Mega Man games, only without the rad boss fights. The large, sprawling stages force you to grind through tons of enemies, and you better enjoy it, because you're going to be forced to visit each stage over and over and over.\n\nCrafting makes upgrading slow and unsatisfying. Though the gun design system is attractive and interesting at first, it's easy to maximize DPS in most situations with a high-damage, small clip revolver in my experience. Most other upgrade systems are perfunctory, but rely on tiresome grinding to get the correct ingredients.\n\nBoss fights are wearisome due to their implementation, similar to that of console hit Monster Hunter, where you have a limited window of time to defeat a boss, and then for some reason it runs away to another part of the stage, forcing you to grind over to its new location, or tiresomely set up in a new location to just wait for it to reemerge. Add in the fact that the bosses are clearly designed for multiplayer, so a single player has to take longer to beat them... and the stage overall has a time limit, so it's possible to fail the stage if your luck in locating the boss is bad.\n\nIt ultimately combines the worst of the old (enemies spawning just off screen, long enemy patterns where you can't hurt foes) and new (repetitive fetch missions through the same area, tiresome crafting and collecting). That isn't to say it doesn't have some old-school charm to it, but you have to be willing to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze to get that little spurt of nostalgia you wanted from this game in the first place.","November 3, 2014","false","12.8"," 215 of 263 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","215","263","0","5"

The sprite based graphics are very easy on the eye and the animations look right.\n\nGameplay wise it may look like metal slug but it reminds me more of the slow and precise nature of the old mega man games. You can’t take a lot of damage so its all about positioning yourself to easily take out enemies.  The locomotion of your character depends on the weight of your equipment, particularly your gun.\n\nThe weapon system works like this, when you kill enemies they drop items, you use these items to craft gun parts and assemble these into guns. If you assemble enough parts with the same stats you can use special ammo, like shots that bounces all over the place or homing missiles. All parts fit together, i.e. you can combine a shotgun stock with a sniper receiver. Now all guns you build are not guaranteed to work well, most probably won’t, but finding one that does is very rewarding and easily my favorite part of the game.\n\nThe level design is in general pretty decent. You progress in the game by doing missions, but  a lot of missions use the same map. This would not be a problem since there are several kinds of missions and those on the same map are generally different, but crafting gun parts require farming. This can make the repeating levels quite tedious.\n(mitigate; proficiency: medicine, slot 1: hoarder, slot 2: lucky penny )\n\nThe bosses in the game inhabit specific places on the map and maps generally have multiple of those. Once you find a boss the mechanics of the boss battle itself is quite good. Easily the worst design decision in the entire game is that unless you are really fast some bosses disappear mid boss battle and appear at some other spot. If you are to slow finding this spot they might teleport again just as you get there. This can lead to some frustration.\n(mitigate; slot 1:computer, consumable: shock bombs)\n\nThe question is whether or not to recommend this game depends on if you like mega man style platforming, farming for materials, experimenting with crafting and can work around a few annoying design decisions. If unsure wait for a sale.\n","April 21, 2015","true","49.8"," 92 of 108 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","92","108","2","1"

That's my like dream game! How could you go wrong? Well, upon playing the first few missions, I realized it was *nothing* like Metal Slug. Unlike actual run n gun games, where combat is hectic and explosive, enemies are strategically placed and tend to be bullet sponges. Even the boss battles manage to be boring. This, in combination with the sluggish character movement, makes the game-play very slow paced at times.\n\nBut hey, "two dimensional Monster Hunter with guns" ain't that bad of a description, so does that aspect of the game redeem it? No. The main problem of the game is that you can only use one gun for the entire mission. This little factor completely changes my opinion of the game; missions can take from ten to thirty minutes to be completed, maps are repeated constantly with different objectives, and enemies are predictable in style. I wouldn't mind these faults, but with only one gun, your customization and freedom can never be unleashed to use different play styles for each long section and thus it gets boring very quickly. You can equip different kind of grenades and melee weapons, but they are far from sustainable to make a difference.\n\nIt's such a shame, because the game has got a lot going for it. The art style is beautiful, and the smooth animations and characterization add a charm to the game. The music is also very well made, although voice acting is cringeworthy. The crafting system is incredible, in every mission you can pick up materials such as iron or animal skins which can be used to craft weapon upgrades and items, and the gun customization is a great concept that allows you to use revolvers which fire grenades and other ridiculous variables, but it's overall executed poorly since only one damn gun can be used at a time. The main saving grace is the local co-op multiplayer, which is much more fun than playing it alone, but even that can get boring at times.\n\nOverall, it's a very pretty game, and can be a worth a try, but overall I can't recommend it. It's such a damn shame, because it has so much going for it, and one of the few indie games I bought at full price (£9) because of its concept, but once you get over the pretty icing, there's not much left of the cake.","December 24, 2014","false","5.4"," 153 of 211 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","153","211","5","2"

It's a 2D platformer in a run-n-gun style which I tend to love.  Here's where the problems come in:  You do missions most of which are fetch-quest style but locating who you're supposed to find or the items you need is completely ambiguous task and the map isn't much help.  Also there's time pressure and enemies that are purpose-built to slow your progress (like the guys with the shields).  Other than that, why is there a reload mechanic in this game?  Gears of War has it because it's a cover-based TPS where you have down-time while in cover and it fits the game style there.  Lastly, why can I not shoot diagonally?  There are plenty of instances where enemies are placed on diagonals and are attacking me but I can't fire back.\n\nWhat I expected out of the game was something more fast-paced like Contra/Metal Slug style game.  If you want it to be more  "adventure" oriented the time-limit is a big roadblock to fun exploration... the game would also need to be less repetitive enemy/level variety as well then.  Like I said, I really want to like this game so I hope you can take this review to heart and do your best to bring out the fun in the game before it's too late.","January 5, 2014","false","5.4"," 484 of 741 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","484","741","0","21"

It's certainly worth about ten dollars for the first 10ish hours of play, but gets way too samey after that.  The developers gave it artificial length by making you play the same map over and over and over and over again, but this mission you kill a real easy boss, the next mission you collect materials, the next mission you kill all of a certain type of mob, etc.\n\nThat having been said, the visuals are on-point, the controls feel like an awesomely perfect old school platformer/shooter, and music, while as limited as the map selection, is real good, the characters are cute and funny, and the gun-play is a blast (pun intended).  The crafting got boring fast, though ... I play games like this so blow peoples heads off, not to stand in front of my gun closet choosing which parts to put together for 12 minutes before each mission.\n\nSteam is going to ask me, "Do you recommend this game?" and only give me a Yes or No.\nYes, with an "if"\nNo, with a "but"\nI'll click no for now, just because I feel it's a bit too expensive for the content.","November 3, 2014","false","10.7"," 96 of 133 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","96","133","0","0"

It has a very metal slug esque feel in terms of both graphics and gunplay. It does have a very weird control system which takes some getting used to and I would reccomend a controler until they fix the keyboard layout or at least support a mouse.  This game takes the metal slug formula of platforming, crazy bosses and twitchy gunplay and adds customizing guns, collecting items, and quests (which are either fetch quests or go here- kill this quests) to the mix.\n\nWhile I would normally reccomend buying this game on sale, there are two reasons I will instead reccomend full price:\n1) They consistantly add more content as time goes on. This of course lends itself to waitin until the game is actually complete before purchasing but\n2) Being a kickstarter, these guys are a small indie (indy? ) studio and as such would benifit more directly for a full price purchase as a larger portion of the sale would actually go to those who directly made the game\n\nVERDICT: BUY IT IF YOU LIKE RPG IN YOUR METAL SLUG.

I'm a fan of Paul Robertson, action rpgs, and weapon customization.\n\nBut the game makes it so hard.  The very core design of the missions is just dull.  Over and over you are given a timer to search a giant maze like map for a randomly placed item or enemy.  Because the maps are large, even if you luck out by heading in the right direction it's still going to take you 5 minutes. If you get unlucky it'll take 15 minutes easily, and if you run out of time or die you have to start over.  It's like they greatly overestimated how much people enjoyed this, because constant navigation is built into things that don't make sense at all.  You spend 10 minutes searching the random boss spawn points to find which one is active, only for the boss to move to another part of the map mid way through the fight.  Now you spend another 2-5 minutes finding the new location, rinse and repeat, and hope you don't run out of time. The game actually expects you to wander through each map a hundred times at 10-20 minutes apiece.\n\nThe weapons you construct have no creativity to them and are just not fun to use.  Sure they are creative art-wise, where you can create a toilet gun, but the moment you try to create a shotgun with more than 2 ammo the game cripples the damage so much as to make it useless.  The real potentials for creativity (piercing shotgun?) are completely unavailable, because you are forced to create a 100% sniper rifle to select piercing ammo.  So you are stuck with a few preset weapon paths, creating incrementally damage increasing versions of the same weapon.  The balance of it works against the mission design, because when you are searching aimlessly through a map of endlessly spawning enemies, making it take 3 seconds to dispatch each enemy (from either low damage ouputs or excessive reload times), it just makes the thing a chore.\n\nIt's highly unlikely that this will be patched either, the devs seem hung up on this idea of a grinding time sink somehow being fun, as similar things were in scott pilgrim too.","May 28, 2014","false","8.6"," 105 of 154 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","105","154","0","4"

If you bought it thinking something like that, you might have a bad time with this game. But hey, at least you get to write a whiny review like everyone and their mother.\n\nSo if you think about buying this to get a quick action fix like aforementioned games, look elsewhere. " So Crawley you rapscallion of a squid, what kind of game is this?" I hear you ask. Well, it pretty much is Monster Hunter with Megamanesque mechanics.\nIt's rather slow paced compared to Metalslug or Contra and features a whole lot of gun and blade customization. You want your combat knife to look like a pizza cutter ? Done. You want a Revolver with a shotgun Barrel and an SMG Stock firing Acid Bullets? This game got you covered. You get annoyed quickly by playing mission-based on only a handful of maps? Well..\n\nThe thing is this: Like in Monster Hunter, you choose a mission and get dropped into one of only few maps, gunning down enemies and collecting different materials to upgrade or modify your Guns, Blades or  Body Armor. Yes there are not that many maps and yes, you have to grind for material. So if this easily irritates you, this might not be a game for you. However, I actually quite enjoyed my first few hours and because of this loot drops from enemies you make at least some progress, even if you fail a mission. Why? Because you get to keep everything you collected.\n\nIn addition to that, there is a little reload minigame, where you want to hit the sweet spot on a reload bar. Contrary to what some reviews imply, the gun does reload nonetheless, if you do not.  If you actually hit the sweet spot, you get a damage bonus for a percentage of your clip, indicated by glowing bullets.\n\nSo after talking about gameplay a bit: The music and artwork is superb. I instantly fell in love with it the first time I saw it, and after playing a while back then I was really disappointed, because I expected this game to be yet another Metal Slug inspired game.\n\nAnd I am pretty glad it is not, because I like this way better.\n\nTL;DR: No this is not Metal Slug. Its Mega Monster Hunter Man. It's obtainable via the Humble  Bundle for one Dollar right now. If you don't mind some grinding  or like either Monster Hunter or Megaman, it is definitely worth it.\n","July 22, 2015","true","19.6"," 78 of 111 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","78","111","5","1"

The idea to put in a reload system was dumb but they way they did it (a time sensitive system) was actually kind of cool. Though it getting annoying fast.

Every mission I attempt feels tedious, slow, and boring, aided mostly by the fact that most every mission is some sort of completely unguided fetch-quest through samey looking environments that are an absolute pain to navigate through.\n\nIf the level design weren't enough to dissuade me from continuing, the limited ammuntion and active reload system makes the gunplay feel especially tedious, and just doesn't work well with the Megaman-style shooting/platforming, especially when the use of cover isn't as much of an option as in Gears of War, the game this particular mechanic came from. I can't count the number of deaths I've encountered after missing my target, only to be shot down during the short idle period in which I wait for the active reload to finish (assuming I successfully reload at all).\n\nThe inventory/item system was another annoyance for me; switching between items feels clunky and slow in situations where speed is needed, and always feels like more of a hassle than is worth.\n\nAs far as the crafting system goes, I honestly can't stand playing the game long enough to gather the items necessary to really try it out, so I don't have much to say regarding that. Perhaps after upgrading my weapons properly, the enemies will feel far less bullet-spongey, and I'll spend much less time standing in one place, jumping, and shooting in mid-air while I wait for an enemy to finally die (supposedly of boredom).\n\nI'm sorry, I want nothing more than to love this game, but this it's an absolute mess. Including modern game mechanics in an old-school platformer/run and gun sounds good on paper, but does little other than clutter the overall design and slow down gameplay. Perhaps if the level/mission design was a little less annoying, it might work.\n\nTo take this game from its current state to something I would enjoy would require gutting the vast majority of the superfluous features, completely overhauling the level design, and possibly even overhauling the crafting system, assuming it is as much of a mess as the rest of the game.\n\nI don't really have any faith in the final product, and I kind of wish I had never spent the money.","February 18, 2014","false","2.3"," 163 of 258 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","163","258","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SillyGate/recommended/218820/","SillyGate","Silver Hemswood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SillyGate/","196 products in account","The team behind Mercenary Kings are sat in that awkward in-between of not having a cult following from simply existing for a long period of time, like Final Fantasy, and not having the excuse of having never developed a game previously. As such, they're neither excused by rabid fanboys nor by simple naivety. In layman's terms; when they dun goof, no one's in their corner.\n\nFor example, it's over a year old (two years if you count Early Access) and it's only just been fixed so that it doesn't crash when you talk to an NPC and try online multiplayer. It's a pretty big deal when such a massive component is unavailable.\n\nThere are typos and syntax errors abound in the game text, something that should've been easy enough to fix in their numerous patches on PC. I do have to give kudos to Tribute's response to the concerns of the completionist demographic; when a kickstart-exclusive achievement made 100%ing the game impossible, they introduced a secondary method of acquiring it. That's gravy in my books.\n\nThe controls feel a bit like a student's final practical. Need to duck? Nope, there's an item by your feet, you're taking that bullet to the face as the collecting animation immobilises you. Nope, there's a ladder a pixel to your right, you're climbing down now. Need to climb down that ladder? Nope, someone put C4 at the top and your backpack is full! You aren't getting down that ladder until someone picks it up or you make room to pick it up yourself.\n\nFurthermore, the game seems to favour the commitment route for control schemes. When you jump, there's very little you can do to influence the path you'll take once you've left the ground. If you're unfortunate enough to try your knife in a pinch, you'll get locked in an uninterruptible cycle if you press it more than once. You'll need to allow plenty of time for the animation lock to finish if you want to so much as turn your character.\n\nThe graphics are the same as you find in Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. Same people, y'see. The style's consistent and the animations are gorgeous, but it becomes clear that some of the spritework was drawn before they finalised the character designs. For example, Lawless' hat bears the wrong logo in her comm. portrait, and Ryack's expression is far too serious for his actual disposition.\n\nI cannot fault the music. It takes a lot of cues from the Sonic games on the Sega Mega Drive (Sonic 2, Sonic Spinball). Gives me dem nostalgia feels. One of the bosses even takes a pointer or two from the first Sonic game.\n\nThe Steel Soldier, Titan Trooper and their recolours have an annoying habit of not telegraphing where they're jumping, and since you sometimes need to immediately dodge to avoid collision damage, it's a 50/50 chance of rolling in the right direction.\n\nOh, and all bosses and enemies deal way more damage via contact than by their lasers, rockets, bullets and missiles. It's pretty much Hug The Wall: The Game for boss encounters, and Flee In Terror: The Horror Flick should you come into contact with the wildlife. Because you can be killed by rabbits. Guess you're allergic?\n\nBosses randomly teleport to other areas of the map for no reason other than to arbitrarily extend gameplay. If it was purely to pressure the player into rushing the fight before he flees, there wouldn't be a time limit on every mission and its grandma.\n\nThere are a handful of large maps that get repeatedly used. The enemy placements are (mostly) the exact same between missions. A room or two will open up sometimes, but in the end, you'll have quickly grown tired of the same recycled layouts and textures before you've even beaten the game.\n\nIn later missions, some of the poorer design decisions become evident. For example, you'll leave a room and see a manhack to your upper-right. It's a perfect 45 degree angle. It'll automatically start descending diagonally towards you. If you jump to shoot it, it'll either be too close and hit you horizontally, stunning you for a second or two, or it'll be too high and it'll start moving horizontally early in response-- their AI is programmed so that they rarely become completely level with your gun if given the time and space.\n\nYour movement and jump speeds are decided by how encumbered you are; your gun, your knife, your consumables, things like that (your gun weight is negated if you holster it). It's a really neat idea when it's used exclusively for hiding secrets, but it's not. You have to leap defenselessly if you're too heavy, and the game has a nasty habit of placing enemies in the way of the finish line, and usually there's a threat for not finishing the "jumping puzzle" all in one go. Sometimes you have to do the entire thing again, sometimes it's a pit of spikes you can't get out of easily and will likely die from. The feature's great on paper but difficult to account for in all of their level designs, something evidently too difficult for Tribute.\n\nDesign-wise, you can't shoot diagonally for two reasons; 1, you'd have to be incredibly precise with your joystick movements (you're not playing this with a keyboard and enjoying it, trust me) so as not to wander and fall. And 2, because each gun sprite would need a second diagonal variation. Remember, Tribute had a limited budget-- something I suspect shows in how some arts assets weren't updated for the final release.\n\nGun customisation goes something like this in later levels: You built a sweet new gun! Does it have armour-piercing? No? Scrap it and take armour piercing so that you don't have to bounce around like a coked-up kangaroo. No, you don't have multiple gun slots while you're out on the field, so unless you have someone to play with, you're not diversifying your calibrations AND beating the missions in any reasonable time.\n\nI'll tell you something though-- crafting is so extensive and addictive, enough to make the constant grinding for materials almost worth it.\n\nI'd say Mercenary Kings has the making of a fairly memorable game, but it needs severe overhauls to give it the edge it needs. Maybe a bigger budget to allow for experimentation? Maybe a sequel...?","May 25, 2015","false","31.9"," 44 of 60 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","44","60","0","3"

This may sound like a very odd combination and the reviews are quite ambivalent about the qualities of the game but especially in co-op this game is a blast.\n\nThe story itself can be told quite fast: The bad guys called „CLAW“ (they have the brilliant slogan „CLAW is law“) kidnapped a famoust scientist and conducted some evil experiments on a solitary island. To end this madness the military sends a super special unit – the KINGS. No, the story won’t win a creativity award, but it’s solid and full of humor. The crazy characters are quite likeable and several conversations are actually interesting and bring in some plot twists. But you can be honest: You won’t play this game for the story…\n\n…you want these guns. And the knifes. And the ammo. All the good stuff. The gameplay can be compared mostly to a mixture of 'Mega Man‘ (jumping and shooting) and 'Monster Hunter‘ (crafting and grinding): First you have your own hub where you are able to buy items, upgrade your equipment and accept the missions. These jobs bring you into larger areas where you have to fullfill goals e.g. killing or capturing a boss, gathering materials or resucing some hostages. So you start running and jumping through the levels, avoiding obstacles on your way (like e.g. lava, needles and other evil stuff). Meanwhile you're shooting at everything that walks in front of your weapon while looking for hidden items and loot.\n\nThe level design is well done, the different areas and layouts allow for some nice exploration and the amount of traps and enemy types really brings some nice variety to the quite repetetive goals. Of course: at the end of several mission there's a boss waiting for you and these buddies provide some nice challenging moments. Most of the time simple button mashing ends in an early death and you really have to understand the patterns and to find a good strategy. Though when you’re finally able to defeat that annoying difficult boss (I look at you 'Metal Woof'!) and he drops the material you were looking for – that’s some pretty great feeling.\n\nTalking about materials: On your journey you’ll stumble across many different ingedrients and materials that can be used to craft individual gun parts, knifes and bionic mods. The amount of different parts is tremendous and they can be combined to fit your playstyle, whether you’re the tanky dude with the shotgun or the spray’n run submachine-type. Crafting new guns, mixing the parts and farming for materials is the core element of the game – and it’s very entertaining.\n\nIn terms of the visuals and the sounds I have to admit that the design and the style is gorgeous (I’m a huge fan of well done pixel-graphics). The environment and the characters are detailled, the animations are perfectly fluid and the overall picture is simply great. And in addition there is an amazing soundtrack, that features some really catchy tracks.\n\nI could go on talking about even more positive points, like the splitscreen multiplayer, the co-op mode or the omnipresent humor. But the negative points of the game can’t be hidden this way: the amount of different areas is very limited (there are over 100 missions but just like 8 different areas, so you will re-visit some rooms and places quite a lot) and after a short amount of time the missions can get quite repetitive (there are only like six different goals). Moreoever some time limits in the missions seem to be set totally random, sometimes you finish with half an hour left and sometimes with barely 3 seconds. That’s also due to the fact that some bosses 'escape‘ randomly after a short fight and then you have to search them again (probably not the brigthest gaming mechanic). Besides your characters appearance lacks some good customization aspects, aside from 12 different color schemes (approximately 75% of them look awful…) for the two characters there’s nothing more. Some unlockable characters (e.g. the 3 other members of the KINGS) and areas after finishing the main game would have been a huge plus.\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nYes, the reviews and opinions for the game have been quite ambivalent. I think the problem is that many bakers and players expected a ‚pimped up‘-version of 'Metal Slug‘ with all its core points and elements. And with these expectations the game may disappoint easily. I bought it in hope to get a mixture of 'Mega Man‘ and 'Monster Hunter‘ – and I’ve never regret buying it because the game entertained me instantly.\n\nAll in all I guess the game would be a solid 7 out of 10 (or maybe a 6 if you dislike good old Mega or grinding) due to all the negative points (that are clearly there), but… I love the game. Sure I would have loved to enjoy even more areas and to customize my character to look different than my partners, but hey... -  I had a machine gun that fired some caustic missiles, which bounced of walls, splitted in little pellets and exploded on impact. That was one hell of a weapon. And I’ll never forget my shark-shaped-knife that shocked enemies on contact.\n\nThese two things alone have to improve the score by at least two points. Because of… reasons! And explosions. And think of the knifes! And the dogs in mecha-dog-suits. Yeah, never forget mecha suit Doge – ‚Metal Woof‘ ready for action!","September 4, 2015","true","49.0"," 38 of 50 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","38","50","5","2"

There are boss fights in the game, but after awhile they will give up and leave, which equals a failed mission. THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. You are already being timed on the stage, you have to find the boss, get fenced in and figure out the pattern, and they can ragequit.

Admittedly, the maps could use a little bit more variety. That's somewhat remedied by way most missions are structured. Each unique map is inherently large so each mission will cover only certain portions of the map (with the rest of it being totally optional).\n\nThe game also makes you consider resource management. While you don't need to do every single mission to 'beat' the game, you do however need to plan which resources to bring and decide when to best use them. For example, infiltration or capture missions will require you to make the best use of your C4 charges and shock bombs. Wasting one or more of each item can usually lead to failing the mission. This becomes even more important when speed runs come into play.\n\nAnother selling point of the game is the massive amount of gun parts and gun combinations available to you through progression. It opens up a lot of possibilities and it's amusing to see different combinations suggested on various videos and forum posts.\n\nWith all these things going for it, Mercenary Kings is not perfect. I'd reckon that the average Metal Slug player will be able to finish majority of the game without even fully scratching the surface as far as crafting goes. I feel that there's a lot of room for improvement when it comes to content. Personally, I feel that the game was too short seeing as I reached the final level long before I even got to halfway on all the crafting achievements.\n\nMy suggestion? Steam Workshop integration. This is another one of those games that will benefit a lot from workshop integration to add newly designed maps. BattleBlock Theater serves as a great example by giving the players access to the various blocks that make up the levels. A move like this will go a long way especially to reduce the boredom from having finished the game and moving onto crafting everything else.\n\nMy initial impression of this game would be at around 9/10. It was definitely fun but it needs something to fill the gap at the end of the game. For now I'd rate this game as a 7/10 since it is severely in need of user-generated content. Nevertheless, it's still an absolutely fun co-op experience. I do recommend getting the 4-pack.","August 15, 2014","true","68.7"," 61 of 96 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","61","96","0","2"

It's really not, though. It's more like Monster Hunter, where you gather materials and embark on quests with specific goals, as opposed to running through stage after stage and then beating the end boss. Mercenary Kings just happens to use 2D gunning/platforming instead of 3D action for its main gameplay mechanic.\n\nThe problem with its emulation of Monster Hunter is that it took the worst parts and made it the bulk of the game. Too many of the quests are boring "Kill 20 small minions, find 10 stupid items, reach this destination." It's repetitive and not interesting.\n\nEven worse, Mercenary King's early boss fights are boring. They all follow the formula of duck, fire, roll under, repeat. There are 3 or 4 palette swaps per boss, who all receive the exact same new move. Why they chose to create 3 subspecies who all act identically is beyond me.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's get to the good stuff.\n\nThe late game bosses become much more interesting and varied. If more of the game were like this, I would give it a glowing review.\n\nThe gun design mechanic is good and forces the player to make meaningful choices and decide between tradeoffs.\n\nPlaying with friends is quite enjoyable.\n\nIn summary, I recommend the game, but if any of the above sounds unpalatable to you, then definitely skip it.","August 18, 2015","true","64.9"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","2"

If you want Metal Slug, go play Metal Slug.\n\nMercenary Kings is a 2D action-platformer with a variety of missions to undertake with generally non-linear level design. Yes, many of the missions share the same maps which I admit is a bit of a bummer, they could use some more variety since there is typically only 2-3 different maps per rank. Still, they're large and fun to explore and, with different types of missions including extermination (kill x amount of y), neutralize (kill boss), gathering (fetch items) and rescue (self-explanitory), among others, the different tasks do mix it up enough to keep it from getting completely stale.\n\nWhat? Grinding? Yeah, there's grinding. You will need to grind materals to upgrade your gun's parts and upgrade your melee weapons. You will end up repeating missions over and over for mats. However, after the first run or two on a mission, you'll memorize the pattern of where everything is, making it much easier and faster to complete, so it's not as bad as it may sound.\n\nThe tunes are good, visuals are splended and charming, humor is amusing, characters are likable and the story works well for what it is.\n\nControls are responsive and both my old PS3 controller and my Logitech F310 work perfectly...do NOT attempt to play this with your keyboard or you're gonna have a bad time. I cannot stress that enough, do not use the keyboard, use a controller. Game client is stable; constant 60 FPS and no crashes to note.\n\nThe gun upgrade/mod system is fun and quirky, but could've been more refined and balanced, as the biggest changes to note are appearences, semi-auto/auto, clip size and reload time. While in theory this sounds nice since it boils down to preferences, many combanations lack fire-power so if you want major damage, you're limited to a few choice combanations. Considering this was one of the big selling points/features, it feels like it was unfinished and rushed.\n\nI wish I could comment on the 4 player co-op, but I've never had an opportunity to try it.\n\nMercenary Kings isn't a game you can pick up and finish in an afternoon, it requires patience, time and investment.

HOWEVER, forget any skillfull evasion then, because in close quarters you will get hit no matter what.

Secondly is the gameplay: its very satisfying and deliberate the controlls feel tight and the guns feel meaty with good sound effects and enemy death animation.\n\nThere is quite a lot of content however you do spend your time redoing things quite a lot in a sort of monster hunter fashion where you go to the same levels over and over to get materials however instead of just killing a boss there are different objectives for different missions like destroy something with explosives or save some hostages things like that. As for the bosses themselves they are pretty good they have attack patterns which can be quite difficult to master fighting against making them satisfying however unfortunately there isnt that many bosses in the game so you will find yourself fighting the same ones or varients on the same ones over and over.\n\nThis is a really solid game and can keep you going for a while if you enjoy it I spent a lot of time collecting different gun parts and trying different combinations however i eventually got bored of repeating the same areas over and over and moved on to other games.

That's not to say I don't enjoy the other games I play and adore, but this just tickles a fancy like none other. The rewards offered through progression, the challenges when the enemies ramp up, or when a new boss is introduced - they make playing endlessly entertaining. Now, much of the criticism the receives is due to a popular idea that the game is similar to Metal Slug. I've personally never played it, shame on me and such, but if you're looking for that experience, then you ought to play Metal Slug. This isn't like another game I've played, while it shares elements with many, it's an entity of its own.

The art and music is beautiful, and  the mechanics that they draw from Borderlands, Monster Hunter, and Metal Slug are very cool in concept. But, therein lies the problem. There is tons of character and tons of concepts, and they just don't really gel together in a satisfying way. The beautiful art is done injustice by how stiff the animations are, and by how creepingly slow variations in environments and enemies are introduced. While the music is good, the sound effects are flat, and don't provide any real sense of punch to the action. The guns are incredibly flaccid and static, feeling more like gussied-up number hoses than firearms. Customizing the guns doesn't really feel meaningful or fun. As in Borderlands, all the variety in the world ends up just being wallpaper for a different set of slightly different numbers. This is compounded by the fact that new weapons cannot even be found in the wild, reducing the excitement of their procurement a great deal. Action is plodding with neither the fast pace of Metal Gear nor the precision of Mega Man, but a muddy, fuzzy middle-ground that isn't satisfying.

If there is a fault to be had with MK is that it may be too ambitious.\n\nNaturally, the first thing you notice about MK is the look of it, and anyone worth their government-provided meat-substitute recognizes the style as, as I said before, Metal Slug (in terms of tone and atmosphere) and Scott Pilgrim (in terms of art style and visual humor). For many, this acts as a barrier to keep them from wanting to try the game and instead ridicule it for being "too much like a Metal Slug rip off!" when in fact that couldn't be further from the truth, but more on that later. The art style is incredibly charming and fun, despite taking place on a militarized island populated with murderous COBRA rejects. Sadly, and this is where part of the over ambition comes into play, the environments repeat themselves a lot, a whole lot. This is not so much a fault of the level designs, but more due to the fact that you will play different (i.e. different objectives every now and then) missions in the same level over and over until you manage to advance in rank. If the level art was a tad more detailed and beautiful this would be forgivable but after so many hours it gets bland.\n\nSound is nothing really to complain about or praise, but it gets the job done. Simple, appropriate, though like the art it can get repetitive as you listen to the same level music over and over and over again.\n\nNaturally the most important bit of information you want to know is "how does it play?" While some screenshots and/or videos may have led you to believe it plays like Metal Slug, it really doesn't all that much. MS had you going through a linear, left-to-right, level with occasional height changes. MK's maps are far more complex, the map probably even confusing some at first with the interwoven connecting paths, and should be looked at more like a Castlevania map - large and sprawling, with hidden alcoves, optional boss rooms, etc. You'll be jumping around a lot, ascending to reach a goal or carefully descending to avoid hazards. I would say it feels a lot like Spelunky in its controls, but how easily you move is dependant on what you have equipped.\n\nThe real meat and potatoes of this game are the guns. You collect materials from fallen enemies and found crates and use these resources, and money garned from completing missions, to craft components for your gun. Here is where the game really shines, as it doesn't restrict which part can go with what component, and if you want to try and make a terribad gun, you're just as able to as you are to make an amazing gun. The elements of any gun really work toward tailoring to your preferred method of runnin' and gunnin'. You could take a huge gun with tons of stopping power and a low clip, or you can take a smaller, faster gun so you can dodge enemy attacks more easily. Elemental upgrades for bullets allow you to gain an advantage or disadvantage against a given enemy, and many parts take advantage of the art style by looking silly, fun, or just plain ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.\n\nReally, it's the gun crafting and shooting that keep this game from feeling too tedious (at first). However, as time drags on, you find yourself grinding levels for materials and money, fighting the same boss over and over, collecting X of that and Y of this, killing some of these and more of those. Honestly, if your main gripe with MMOs are the fetch/mob kill quests, this game may not be for you.\n\nThe co-operative play really helps keep this game feeling fun, as your friends can split up and explore are area to finish the mission faster or you can operate as a time with one being the fast shooter for smaller enemies and attracting the attention of big ones while the other player with the bigger, slower, guns take the kill shot. If you have some friends who are interested in this game and you think they would enjoy the experience with you, this is not a bad grab.\n\nThere are other crafting elements in this game, allowing you to customize your tent interior, or create body mods to gain a variety of pros and cons (like increased drop rate, faster speed, etc.), and meals before a mission to give you a nice HP stat boost.\n\nOverall, this game is fun, make no mistake, but it feels tired at about 50% (it's a very long game, surprisingly), and that's why its ambition is its downfall. The creators tried to do too much and ended up spreading their efforts too thin, giving us plenty of features but no major depth to any of them (gun crafting excluded). Had they taken some more development time to craft some more levels, think up better mission objectives, or polish up the scenery it would have been a perfect game.\n\nStill, I can still recommend it to anyone who enjoys action/platformers with a Metal Slug/Metroidvania/Spelunky/Scott Pilgrim heritage, though maybe wait for it to go on sale for around $10, at most.","April 5, 2014","true","31.6"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","3"

Crafting your first machine gun after being stuck with the sub-par starter gun is hugely satisfying, as is completing a mission with all bonus objectives and enough resources gathered to buy several upgrades.\n\nThat said the gameplay turns out to be rather poor. On a regular basis players need to avoid enemy projectiles while firing at airborne enemies homing in on them and platforming, all at the same time. Sadly, the game lacks the silky smooth controls required to make this fun and instead just ends up being frustrating.\nThe actual gameplay takes the form of missions, each one with their own objective. Between them players can visit their homebase for upgrades and supplies. There are two major problems with this. First: missions take place in large locations which get recycled again, and again, and again. Secondly: no information is provided as to where in the freely traversable levels the current objective is located. As a result players are forced to scour the same places over and over again, often with endlessly looping background music, too. Combined with limited time for each mission things can become rather frustrating fast.\n\nOther annoyances:\nThe camera is not overly intelligent.\nExponential grinding for better gear.\nJumping has a noticeable delay to it.\nJumping down larger heights leads to the character freezing for a moment upon landing.\nSome enemies can fire diagonally, which players flatout can't.\nEnemies may respawn the moment their spawn location is off screen.\nHealth items are few and far in between, making the gameplay rather unforgiving.\nHealth can be regenerated at field hospital, which act as save points. The health regen is slow enough to not be noticeable. The game doesn't bother mentioning that this health regen exists.\nIt's impossible to jump while crouching, making destructable platforms the player has to fire at while standing on them and exercise in patients.\nDefault grunt enemies on platforms above the players may randomly decide to drop down, giving no chance to walk away or kill them.\nThe first boss decided to leave once he was on low health. He came back eventually but not soon enough for there to be time to finish him off, leading to a failed mission.

It's kind of bland but it can be skipped without an issue (just keep pressing "next" everytime the dialog windows show up after some key missions).\n\nThe negative:\n-Gathering materials is a chore. Even upgrading your armor requires grinding (example: one armor requires 2 of a material that's only dropped by one boss; to make matters worse, it's not a guaranteed drop)\n-There are a lot of missions but they are really repetitive.\n-Maps are quite big, which could be a good thing but you must check the map constantly to see if you are going to the right direction. Some missions actually don't tell you were the objectives are but luckily those are quite few.\n-Crafting is kind of confusing but the worse thing is being constantly constrained by having to find materials.\n-The food that can give you a boost on health (+ other temporary stats) must be grinded in the "hunting grounds" were you basically kill -mostly- harmless animals that provide no challenge. The whole thing looks like an unfinished featured that ended up being rushed.\n-"Profencies" that you can get by crafting lots of stuff seem kind of nice but they are not worth the trouble of finding all the materials.\n-The special "mods" that you can equip to your character are mostly kind of useless (although the one that assures that every enemy drops a material on death is extremely necessary to be able to craft weapons)\n-Enemies have "strenghts" and "weaknesses" that you can learn about by talking to a guy in your camp and changing your bullets for each mission is so boring that you'll probably use the one with the higher attack number and disregard everything else.\n-Weapons have a lot of different stats but they really don't change the playstyle.\n-You can craft a lot of decorative stuff that serve no purpose except tempt you into wasting your materials. In my opinion it would have been better to see the base change as you completed missions.\n\nConclusion:\nI can see a lot of potential in this game but it's full of really strange decisions that seem to be aimed at increasing the playtime of the game (but that's not the same as a game having a great replay-value).\nin my opinion the game would have been a lot better without crafting and actually focusing in making combat and missions more varied.","August 19, 2015","false","21.9"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","12","16","3","0"

Also, enemies respawn on the maps, so you can't even slowly/strategically work your way through difficult areas.  The "customization" isn't very exciting, and parts are tedious to collect in this game, not too mention, the weapons you finally do put together aren't even fun to use.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/218820/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Every time I see Mercenary Kings brought up online, people get warned away from it for various reasons. Despite that, I'm here to say that it's gone down as one of my favorite games. Seriously, it's one of those where I'll play it for 2-3 hours and then have to force myself to play something else because I want to keep doing missions. It might not be for everyone, but let me share the good parts with all of you for a change.\n\nSo if you've somehow glossed over this one, Mercenary Kings is a side-scrolling shooter in the vein of Metal Slug. Unlike Metal Slug, however, you have a persistent character that you upgrade with new guns and mods and stuff over the course of a hundred or so missions. And those missions take place in huge, wide-open levels with lots of paths and secrets to find. Missions range from beating bosses to saving hostages to recovering intel to gathering materials. Materials are very important, of course, because they let you build new guns and mods and stuff.\n\nSee, there's something like 300 guns in the game, and you build each one piece by piece, using money from missions and materials from exploring and shooting dudes to unlock components. Those pieces can be mixed and matched to create monstrosities like a 32-round caustic shotgun. It's kinda like Borderlands if you could custom-build each gun. You can also build mods for yourself that give you major advantages, like speed boosts and regenerating health, or guaranteeing material drops and finding more money. There's also melee weapon crafting, cooking, and decorating your tent!\n\nThere's also a surprising amount of goofy-♥♥♥ story, too. About half the missions are bookended with short character scenes like this that move the plot along. You have to rescue people to expand your camp, and once in awhile something will happen to them, like I had to go save my gunsmith at the start of the rank 4 missions. The design for the characters is by the same guy who did the Scott Pilgrim beat-em-up that sadly never made it to PC, and everything is beautifully animated.\n\nWhen the subject comes up, I've seen three big complaints about the game. The first is the bosses, and they're definitely one of the weak points. You have to actually find them in the level (unless you use the mod that shows their location on the map), usually in one of four locations, and they move around. Worse than that, they can run away while you're fighting them, meaning you have to follow them, though they're marked on your map after you find them once. They're not like Metal Slug bosses, either... they tend to be invincible until they reveal their weak point, so you have to learn their attacks and patterns. Once you do, though, they're not that hard. Capture missions ♥♥♥♥ing suck, though... you have to weaken the boss to a certain point and then hit them with a special grenade you can only carry like two of. I won't fault anyone who got stuck on a Capture mission and quit because of it.\n\nThe second complaint is that you have to grind for materials, and I really don't get that one at all. The first few mods that open up let you control material drops; one guarantees a drop from every enemy but lowers the chance of getting rarer ones, and another makes rare drops more likely but reduces the cash you get from missions. There are no real rare drops, either. Each enemy has up to three items they drop, but they tend to be spread around so that almost every material is a common drop from something. The only hard to get ones are boss drops, but you can find those hidden on most levels in secret rooms, and they're always in the same boxes so you can get as many as you want during missions there.\n\nThe last is that it's repetitive, and really that's going to be entirely up to the player. There are ten ranks of missions, with 10-12 missions per rank. Missions tend to take place on the same 2-4 maps per rank, so if you get tired of doing different things on the same levels, then yes, it's going to be repetitive. After almost 30 hours I haven't really tired of any of the missions and still go back and replay old ones to get extra materials and try to beat the par times. It's not perfect, but I got absolutely addicted to it and I didn't even play it co-op. Honestly, it's not a Metroidvania game but it's scratching the same itch for me that the old GBA Castlevania games did. If you like item hunting and gear customization in your platform games, I think it's a blast.","September 20, 2015","true","28.2"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

The graphics and the gameplay strongly resemble those of the Metal Slug series. There’s the side-scrolling and 2D platforming that old school gamers have appreciated.\n\nThe plot of Mercenary Kings is about a mercenary who is part of a resistance group that is doing battle with a villainous organization known as The Claw. The narrative quickly becomes irrelevant as you start off in camp and learn to customize your mercenary character. There is no voice acting, so you have to read the dialog text to understand what is really going on. The lack of relevance the narrative has does not bring the game down since gameplay tries to be the strength of the game.\nUpon playing this game I first realized how awkward the keyboard controls are. There is no mouse to be used in the game, but the keyboard makes the gameplay feel like a drag. I firmly believe that fans of the Metal Slug series would be best advised to use a controller or gamepad to have any fun with this game. Another aspect of the gameplay that feels like a drag is the repetitive nature of the battles with The Claw. You have a limited number of lives and after each death you will have to face the same enemies and this feels quite tedious. Using keyboard controls is difficult when trying to press buttons to shoot, jump, and roll.\n\nThe graphics are pixelated, but that’s not too bad for a game that’s trying to be an old school, 2D side scroller. If the game had more variety in its levels, the replay value would be exponentially higher. I really wanted to like Mercenary Kings because of its concept of being of resistance fighter battling an organization of villains and the various characters to choose from and customize. Weapons can also be customized so that your mercenary can leave camp for battle with better gear.  I can only recommend this game to those with a game controller or gamepad and do not care much about the quality of the narrative. If you’re a gamer who is accustomed to using the keyboard/mouse combination, I would not recommend Mercenary Kings unless you are willing to commit yourself to playing with a game controller or gamepad.  I give this game a score of 6/10.","June 14, 2015","false","4.3"," 17 of 30 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","17","30","0","2"

However since then I have gotten to the later stages and now I see this game is everything I used to hate about old school games. In the later levels the Devs decided to make it more challenging by adding jump mazes that require a high end controller to do. If you are trying with a cheap controller or a Keyboard.. good luck...  And the time limits imposed on those missions make it so you are trying to rush though which of course increases the chance you will fail due to missing a jump.  And mix that all with the fact that there is usually more then one way to go on the map to your objective however some ways are blocked by doors that require C4 and since you can only carry 1 C4 that means if you choose a direction incorrectly once then the short time expires and you lose because of that.\nits really to bad. The game is a ton of fun all the way up to captain with a few annoyances here and there and then you just hit this wall of missions that suck all the fun from the game and induce extreme frustration.","May 7, 2015","false","22.7"," 20 of 36 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","20","36","0","0"

It feels like it lacks flair or intensity. Coming back to something like Metal Slug, the action feels very kinetic and constant.

I think the most common description of this game would be something along the lines of Metal Slug x Borderlands. Where the gameplay is obviously like Metal Slug but the be all end all is to upgrade your weapons, armor and mods through pickups. I think at most that's where this game kinda diverts from the two games mentioned and probably falls closer to the gathering games found in MInecraft or Terraria. There is no leveling method from what I've seen and the only way to increase your health and weaponry is by increasing your money by doing missions and picking up material drops found during those missions. At first, the game may seem difficult like most shooters will but once you get a decent upgrade going the game will start feeling like classic shooters from days past. I think what sold me on this game was when I was rolling with another player online (4 player co-op) and she was carrying around the spread gun.

But this genious game offers so much more with crafting, rank system, upgrades, multiplayer, mission types and even with enemy types.\n\nWhen i first started playing, i fully expected to just run through a one direction level blasting everything without much thought, but it suprised me.\nFirstly, each level can be "explored".  You can go up, down, left, right.. there is a full map to traverse!\nEach enemy has vantages that can make you think as you approach it. It's not all mindless blasting ( well you can try, but you get beat up a fair bit ). Then there is the bosses. They each are challenging and have unique weaknesses.\n\nPro's:\nWonderful arcade style graphics.\nMany hours of playtime.\nGreat fun with a few friends on online multiplayer!\nChallenges around every corner with enemy types, bosses, objectives, items and gear setups.\nMany missions and a few different mission types to keep things interesting. I Personally Love this.\nEach "mission" has side objectives and even secret objectives. Keeps things more interesting while giving you a chance to earn some extra dosh. So it's not always a single minded objective.. you have the choice to take things further.\nCrafting! Craft you own weapons, be it automatic, semi auto, bladed, single blast, double barreled.. so many possabilities! You can even install bullet types for different effects. I Had some fun mixing weapon parts.\nUpgrades! Upgrade your armor, install skills & effects and some camp vanity. Just to make things more interesting.\nA Large map on each mission to explore. "where am i suppose to go? Oh hello... there is a map! D:  "\nJust addictive!\nCon's:\nInitial keyboard setup can be frustuating initially. ( Though remapping or plugging in a controller makes it excellent ).\nSome missions that fully require certain items to complete it can become depleted thus making the mission void.\nThere is no option to "cancel mission" or "return to camp". So you are forced to exit to the game menu to cancel a mission mid-mission.\nLives are shared in multiplayer. So if you have a reckless friend who plays like a lemming, you will see the lives dwindle thus Failing the mission once depleted.\nQuite a few skills (mods) seem to have some negative effects that overwhelm the positive.\n\nI Would recommend this game 110%. I Would even encourage multiple purchases so you can share the fun with friends!!\n\n"Now waiting for Mercenary kings 2"","August 6, 2015","true","24.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

The evil organization CLAW makes me think of a James Bond villain's gang. This makes the setup quite enjoyable.\n\nI recommend this game and my number of play hours is testimony. Being a 2D pixel art game it ran great on my old laptop and this has been the game I played in transportation for quite a while.\nHowever, I believe this game also has a few annoying aspects that could be a deal breaker to some people. Il try to summarize it all in a list of pros and cons.\n\nThe Pros :Crazy amount of gun parts to craft. Lots of ingredients to loot.\nNice "Megaman meets Rambo" platformer gameplay.\nLevels are very big and quite complex. The map is mandatory to not get lost!\nThere are several "missions" for each map. You get to explore each throughly as the objectives are in different locations for each mission.\nMissions have appropriately varied objectives (collect ingredients, kill a boss, save hostages...). There are many of those missions, making the game quite long.\nIt will take you dozens of hours to craft the rarest parts, get the achievements, and unlock all the rewards.\nThe Cons :\nThere is a very annoying mechanic with the bosses : they can flee. Sometimes they flee to another arena at the other side of the map, and you don't have time to get there before they flee and change location again.\nThere are several missions for each map. Despite different spawns, goals, and how huge the maps actually are, it can be repetitive to see the same level 5 times in a short time span.\nThere may be many "missions", but aren't that many maps/levels in the game. The mission objectives don't modify the maps much either.\nTo farm some ingredients, you'll have to play the same mission many times. This makes the issue above even worse.\nWeapon parts are all a fragment of a "complete gun". These "complete guns" are all very powerful (at the point in the game when you can get the ingredients to craft their parts). This actually discourages you to experiment with gun building, since those "default guns" are very good.\nOverall, I recommend playing this game in smaller sessions, so that the repetitive aspect doesn't feel as bad, allowing you to enjoy the actual qualities of the game. Getting better at killing those bosses before they flee is also a great way to make this game less frustrating.","October 6, 2015","true","60.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Mercenary Kings came dangerously close to being great but stumbled near the finish line and crashed hard. Maybe it's me. I'm going to recommend, because it's not a bad game in any way and it features a pretty cool concept. Ultimately it's fun and i've been playing it longer than i initially thought i would. And i still want more. If you're into pixel art, retro styled action platformers, this is a very solid, if very uninspired game.\n\nMercenary Kings has some good ingridients, but doesn't seem to click too well. It takes some pretty bland cliches of 80/90 over the top cartoons, villains and macho bs heroes but doesn't use them to create anything compelling. It rehashes cliches for the sake of rehashing cliches which is a shame because the game has some pretty good elements.\n\nOrdinarily, i'd expect a game to come up with a cool concept then ruin it by being lazily half-arsed or rushed, but Mercenary Kings actually has good art and sound. I can't blame the developers for lacking effort because it's certainly there. The characters are drawn and animated with style and their dialogue fits the brash and cliched design. But they're unlikable and almost ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I don't expect great depth but they're very "cookie cutter" and not very memorable, although i must begrudgingly admit the idiots kinda grew on me after a while. Animation and dialogues are well done, no complaints there. Maybe there's one too many generic clones of the generic villian soldier but that may well be intentional and it fits the theme.\n\nThe controls seemed pretty weird to me, but they can be remapped. A simple run 'n gun platformer shouldn't be confusing, but it took me a while to come up with a control scheme that i felt comfortable with. Which is the same one i got used to in Risk of Rain btw. The controls are responsive and other than there being too many of them, there's really nothing wrong so maybe just attribute my control discomforts to the fact the game just refuses to "click" for me.\n\nLevel design is, as has been noted in other reviews, very repetitive but once again, Mercenary Kings has many ingridients of a good game and while you're still interested in the RPG-like aspects of gameplay, or looking to concoct even weirder combinations of weapon parts to smash enemies with, you'll be able to forgive the repetitivnes. It may even help a little because the game is pretty difficult at frist, unless you're really good at action platformers.\n\nSpeaking of RPG elements, there's leveling up, acquiring extra skills and abilities, collecting resources to craft both usefull and useless upgrades but i was kinda uninterested in them at first. Maybe they were not presented the way i'd like or i was whiny and temperamental or whatever but it felt like a bunch of possibilities were dumped on me all at once, and then i was told to grind away and eventually unlock the stuff. Grind is a bit unkind because gameplay is pretty fun and the concept of mixing platforming, combat, RPG progression and crafting is promising. But then again repetitive levels do make it feel like a grind, so and the promise kinda falls flat. As with characters, i never felt any connection to any upgrade or whatever. It very much felt like i was doing whatever to kill whatever, in order to rescue whatever so i can whatever whatever...\n\nOptions are pretty sparse. There's volume controls, control remapping, windowed or fullscreen and... that's it. No resolution choices though reportedly you can scale the game down by using -windowed -scale=2 as a command line argument. It didn't work for me though.\n\nHavent tried multiplayer but it seems like it's well implemented. There's co-op in either split screen or online and you can set players to join only if they're on your friends list or allow all. Or you can invite manually.\n\nThere is gore and violence but since it's done in a pixel art style, it isn't graphic in a way comparable to modern shooters or horror games. It is violent and over-the-top as much as the artstyle allows, so if you're concerned about that, then skip this game. It's fun and fitting and wonderfully old-skool and enemies explode in chunks of violence and gore. It's meant to be fun of course, but it definitely isn't to everyone's tastes.\n\n\nRepetition is fine for as long as you're having fun playing. -Recommended.","July 25, 2015","true","22.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joshtendo/recommended/218820/","joshtendo","Jitters","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joshtendo/","304 products in account","Mercenary Kings = Metal Slug + Monster Hunter (with just a dash of metroidvania). Unfortunately as good as this combination sounds, Mercenary Kings doesn't live upto any of those games, instead it seems to awkwardly straddle the divide between them.\n\nIf your expecting a fast paced sidescrolling run and gun game like Metal Slug or Megaman X, you will be disappointed. Movement is in no way terrible, but in comparison to games that excel in the genre the characters will seem sluggish (I know that running speed is affected by equipment weight) and the controls will feel loose and a bit unresponsive (especially jumping). Also being unable to shoot diagonally seems like a big oversight for a game like this. Don't be expected to be oneshotted by enemies but at the same time be prepared to spend more taking enemy grunts down. Once again though this doesn't make Mercenary Kings a bad experience, you just need to manage your expectations.\n\nAnyone familar with Monster Hunter will be right at home with the way that Mercenary Kings handles missions and crafting. Missions are selected from an npc in the hub basecamp, mostly fetch/kill quests which take place over a handful of levels (encouraging you to explore new areas of each map) with a few boss battles sprinkled through each tier. A new tier becomes available after completing specific missions which usually involve the introduction of a new boss, which can be captured or killed depending on the mission and/or your preference. Enemies(and Bosses) will drop items needed to craft new gun parts and knives. Just like Monster Hunter to get your favourite equipment you will find yourself grinding. All though this formula worked great with Monster Hunter, unfortunately Mercenary Kings doesn't pull it off half as well. Although maps in Monster Hunter were reused in every mission, you didn't have to wade through 15 min of the same pattern of enemies to get to your objective, you could generally just run there. Weapons in Monster Hunter varied greatly, feeling very different to use and with very different stats, in Mercenary Kings it really just boils down to dps. I also feel like there are some real balancing issues with the different gun types. Who wants to grind for gun parts when the guns just feel like reskins of your current weapon. For grinding to be viable gameplay in a game like this bosses really have to be something special, with random attack patterns and unpredictable AI, every fight needs to feel different. This is also something that Monster Hunter gets away with but Mercenary Kings seems to struggle with.\n\nI don't know if this review will help anyone and I really have just scratched the surface on what to expect but overall although there a lot of questionable design choices in Mercenary Kings, I HAVE enjoyed my time playing it, especially with my friends. It may not compete with other games from similar genres, but what it does do is provide a enjoyable unique hybrid experience, and for that it was worth my money.","January 30, 2014","true","120.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

This means planning ahead; while at the home base / lobby you will spend money and materials gained during missions to unlock new gun parts, knives, and mods, and outfit yourself as you like;  Do you set yourself up with an optimal plan for your next mission, or just go with what seems fun? Either way, you have a LOT of options to choose from.\n\nAnother unique quality to Mercenary Kings is the large and non-linear qualities of it's maps;  While each of the different levels gets reused for multiple missions, each one is HUGE with numerous interconnected rooms.  Some missions task you with exploring these maps at large on the look-out for specific enemies or materials, while some give you a clearly marked point to reach (or numerous potential boss locations) and you simply need to navigate a favorable route.\n\nWhatever the individual mission objective, it becomes easier and more fun to accomplish with friends.  The co-op REALLY shines when done locally, with two to four friends together in split-screen.  Equally viable is to invite friends online, using steam voice chat or skype for communication.   Public, auto-join online co-op is also available but it's far less ideal, as your only means of communication are a series of quick voice-macros, and there's no way of knowing if the player in charge is thirty missions behind you or thirty missions ahead.   No matter how you choose to do it, the game encourages you to split up and comb different areas of the map, trying to reach or search for your objective, and then meeting up to take on tough bosses together.\n\nSpeaking of which, the bosses are another area where the game truly shines.  If you've played earlier in the beta, you'll be amazed at how much improvement was made to the game's varying bosses;  each has a wide variety of different attacks and patterns it will follow and each is equally deadly, enough to challenge the most hardcore action-platformer fan.\n\nIn summary, Mercenary Kings draws inspiration from a LOT of things, but it's as new and original as it is nostalgic, and worth checking out.","March 29, 2014","true","78.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

The fact that it's mission based and most of the time you'll be farming materials to make new guns parts and what-not adds to that.\n\nPros:\n-It has very appealing aesthethics and animation\n-There's a lot of customization options for your gun (though not right out of the box).\n-It has online multiplayer (up to 4 people)\n\nCons:\n-You gotta farm a lot to be able to get better gun parts (which is bad for those who just want to get into the action).\n-The Action itself is pretty slow paced (it also doesn't seem at all challenging)\n-Playing with friends doesn't make it any more hectic and actually slows it down even more since you have to wait\nfor each player to catch up to go to the next area of the mission.\n\nIn Short:\nIf you like a action based games that play similar to classics like Metal Slug, Contra, or Mega Man. This is probably not the game for you.\n\nIf you happen to like farming and don't mind slow pased action and find quirky and bouncy artstyles a good enough reason to buy a game.

That's the missions part, now let's get to the camp part. The camp is a place you roam between the missions, it's split into two parts:\n1) The main camp\n2) Hunting grounds (You can go here to get animals' food, and harvest fruits)\nThe whole point of the camp is that it consists of different members, that do different functions, you can go here to customize your weapons, cook yourself a meal, forge yourself a knife, choose a mission, search for games, customize your tent (Your bragging place, that you can show to different players that join you, here you can have a banner, and ornament, and three of your favourite weapons sets created by youself shown), upgrade armor. Although I didn't play through the game fully yet, this is probably all of the functions that will be available. At first not all of these functions will be available, you must get them through specific missions\n\nGUNS N' KNIVES. THEIR STATS\nThis part feels very entertaining, you can create a bunch of variations of EVERYTHING, quick advice though, negative stats can make your gun better, depending on what you're trying to do. About knives, you can't customize them, but there's so much of them, that you wouldn't want to.\n\nPLATFORMING\nVery good, uhh, I think that's all I can say, there's a weight system though, it's determined by your knifes and guns.","July 25, 2014","true","12.6"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

It's just a weak Metal Slug ripoff. The missions all take place in the same locales, and the objectives are always kill x of this enemy or collect x of this item. Some times you have to capture a boss, but there is no explanation beforehand as to how you do this. I'd battled through the stage only to mistakenly kill the boss because I'd ran out of the item needed to capture him. Both yours and the enemies projectiles are painfully slow. There are only two directions you can shoot in whilst not jumping. Up and left / right. This makes fighting certain flying enemies a major pain in the balls. Especially when they knock you off of a ladder or a zipline when you're just trying to get from A to B. The boss fights are rubbish too. You do so much damage to the boss and then he walks through into the background and appears at a random location on your map. And unless you pay for one of your people to spot the boss, you're left running through the stage blind. Battling the respawning enemies. The worst are easily the slow moving flying drones. Slowly followed by these little jumping turnip headed ♥♥♥♥ers. They are very difficult to hit unless you have a shotgun, due to them springing about all over and your projectiles being telegraphed.\nI haven't enjoyed my time on this game at all.

Loot is shared, where one person needs to pick it up and the rest of your group gets the rewards, so having someone branch off to look for supplies isn't a bad thing. Plus, with reviving teammates if they get in over their head, and no friendly fire, having a partner helps.\n\nGun customization. Slap together your weapon with multiple options. There are sets, yes, and some parts don't work so well with others, but for the most part you're free to craft your gun with whatever you grab.\n\n==THE BAD==\nThe grind. It's not as terrible as some games can be, Monster Hunter or certain other games considered. But to make some weapons, mods, or ornaments, be prepared to run a mission well into the double digit numbers. Completionists would do well to have patience for this game.\n\nEnemy repetition. Not until about the halfway point in the game do enemies become very varied. Not a huge problem though.\n\n\nUltimately, great purchase and fun game.","September 20, 2014","true","40.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GenC/recommended/218820/","GenC","General Chaøs™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GenC/","630 products in account","Short Review\n\nThis game is like if metal slug and megaman had a baby.Mobs follow that set pattern of movement and attack like many platform games, but can still end up killing you. Boss fights are fun but don't expect a Dr. Wiley type of fight think more stage boss than mini or main boss. Game sports lots of weapon types,ammo types, and combinations of the two ,to be bought and used. Missions types though not in large variety provide enough fun and challenge with the paired game play of the environments. Maps are just right for being able to have a lot of gun shootouts though not as many as some might want since some missions take you back to previous maps.\n\nOnline  MP is probably about the lackluster part in the form of no in game text/voice and no server list.You will randomly connect to someone if they have an open game setup which you can be paired with anyone no matter what rank they are or weapons they have. Other than if someone is jelly on a stick and used up all the shared lives resulting in mission failures this game is one of the few games where it is fun to play with randoms. The game supports up to 4 play local co-op as well.\n\nAll in all this game is a gem and if you were a metal slug fan or not should be on any shooter fans have/get list.\n\nFull Review\n\nReally love this game. Its like metal slug meets ironman. I say this because the way the mobs attack you and how they can be smart or dumb reminds me of megaman.The platforming also remind me of megaman there is a good mix or jumping,rolling,shooting,ducking,blocking,etc.\n\nMissions in the game are the following, rescue hostage,kill a boss,kill a certain # of a type of mob, kill all the mobs in a certain area, meet with and individual,find and destroy an item/s, or collect a certain amount of a item. Now this might not sound like many mission types but the game throws enough at you to not make the missions boring,at least for me.There are secondary objectives for each mission including secret ones not listed.The reward for the other objectives is typically more money and/or parts. You might say meh to that,but when you want to buy/craft that once piece those harder to find items you might get from  them might be worth your time. Thanks to a scrollable in game map the game makes finding your way to your objective pain free though not all objective types will be marked.\n\n\nLevel time can be  a fun time or one that will make you wish for tons more maps.The game has a set number of maps that as you play through the game you will revisit area and unlock larger portions of the areas. This is not a bad thing because you will be more focused on the combat and your objective.Early on in the game it can become a bit tiring to constantly play on the same map,but as you get further along you get a nice variety.The maps themselves are not small and can take you a bit of time to travel around.\n\nThe game is loaded with tons of guns. You can mix and match all of the pieces to make your own guns provided you have bought the pieces from the camp seller. How that works is the mobs drop material/parts: steel,polymer,wood,lead,etc . You need a certain amount to be able to purchase the part.After that you can use it as much as you want. There are full sets of guns, sniper/full-auto/semi-automatic rifles,machine guns,sub machine gunes,miniguns,shot guns,pistols,and I believe rocket/missile launchers. With each type there are also different ammo types for he different housing including elemental ammo (fire,poison,electric and cold).\n\nNow onto the controls, some people have experienced some pains in this area, but there a few guides on how to configure your controls to your hearts desire.If you use a controller that does not seem to work in the game, I suggest a program called Joy2key. I use it for any game that give me grief with my sony controller and it works wonders.\n\nMultiplayer in the game is a hit and a miss. No in game voice/text can annoy some people,but everyone in game that I have played with seem to play just fine, just sucks not being able to text chat at the least. There is no server list,no auto rank connections who you connect with will be completely random. All missions can be played by anyone provided the host has the mission chosen. The community for the game seems appropriate(maybe because of the lack of ingame text/voice lol)\n\nGame is fun, I have clocked quite a amount of time in it already for the short period of time I have owned the game so far enjoying it a lot. My only wishes are  more maps,more mission types and of course a level editor/mod tools. If you are a shooter fan get the game when you find the price what you desire. I hope mighty9 will be as much fun if not more, need more good platform shooters :3","May 18, 2014","true","44.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Mercenary Kings is not Metal Slug and should not be treated as such. It's 2D military Monster Hunter down to the core.\n\nWhat does that mean? Well, for starters, there's a certain set of areas that you'll be redeployed to again and again and again, and larguely these areas will have the same enemies every time, but your goal will be different depending on the mission you take. You might have to gather certain items, destroy a certain object, rescue hostages, clear an area of enemies, kill a boss, and so on. All of these missions also have a time limit, so you can't just take your sweet time looking around, but you'll pretty quickly learn the levels and enemies as you run missions in the areas. All of these are elements pulled right out of Monster Hunter really.\n\nWhat's somewhat different is the crafting. Yes, you go out, gather materials, and them come back to base and cough up some resources and cash to get new equipment. That's the same as Monster Hunter. Where it differs is the depth of customization in your weapon. You get to mix and match parts of your gun to produce different stats and behavior, so you can take a magnum and stick machine gun parts on it if you wish to do so. That said, in reality, what you've really got is a pistol, a machine gun, a burst rifle, a shotgun, and a homing missile launcher, and beyond that you'll just be tweaking stats to manage reload times, reload ease (the game uses an active reload system that can give you a 10% damage boost if you do it perfectly), accuracy, damage, ammo capacity (before reloading, you have infinite ammo otherwise), fire rate, weight, and bullet propeties (homing, elemental, bursting into smaller projectiles, scatter shot, large size, and rebounding). It's actually pretty simple, but there's certainly some joy in tweaking your weapon to suit the situation or match your play style.\n\nNow let's talk about enemies. The enemies in the game all follow very simple behavior patterns, including the bosses, and there's not generally many of them on screen at once. The game certainly has some difficulty when you first encounter enemies and don't know what to expect, but once you learn them it does become somewhat repetative. After all, you're going to be fighting the same enemies on the same levels quite a bit. Nonetheless, I certainly find some joy in being able to rush through levels that I once had difficulty with. That said, as said, the bosses are pretty simple too, so while this game share a whole lot in common with Monster Hunter, don't expect to get the same feeling of accomplishment from downing a tough big bad, because there's nothing quite that scale here.\n\n\nIn any case, the game is pretty fun, but just keep in mind that it's really a Monster Hunter styled game, and that means you're going to spend a whole lot of time looking at the same scenery and fighting the same enemies. If you want an arcade action game with a bunch of hectic levels, this isn't it.","March 28, 2014","true","40.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlStar/recommended/218820/","AlStar","AlStar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlStar/","347 products in account","There is a really great game with powerful crafting abilities hiding underneath an extremely unfriendly introduction.\n\nHere's some of the problems with the game's first rank:\n1) Your starting weapon is weak, short ranged, and has a small clip to boot.\n2) They chose one of the worst maps ever for the starting missions. Confusing layout, lots of little unconnected rooms, and tons of elevation changes; apparently just to screw with you.\n3) Very poor mission choices to start with, including a gathering mission and a rescue 8 hostages mission which, combined with the annoying map layout and the fact that the stuff you're looking for isn't marked on the map (most missions are kind enough to give you an 'x' to head towards,) seemed to have been chosen specifically to weed out new players.\n4) Your extremely limited choices to upgrade, once you finally manage to pick up some crafting supplies, really don't give you the tools to significantly modify your weapon.\n\nAll told, it'll take you somewhere around an hour and a half to get out of that horrible slog.\n\nSo why am I recommending this game?\n\nBecause as soon as you start to move up the ranks, all kinds of new stuff is unlocked which greatly improves the experience. You start getting all kinds of real choices for your weapon: bullet hose machine gun or single-shot sniper rifle? Shotgun or pistol? Submachine gun or magnum? Your choice! Mix and match pieces from each to completely customize your experience and unlock the ability to use special ammo types with a variety of effects.\n\nYou'll also start seeing some interesting choices for hand-to-hand weapons: Do you take the tiny knife that won't weigh you down, or a massive sword or spear that can inflict massive damage at range (and never runs out of ammo!)\n\nThe ability to choose two perks that can really help customize your character. Need to throw more bullets at things? Double your magazine size or pick up faster shooting. Looking for crafting materials? Make it so that enemies always drop items and/or make them drop rare items more often.\n\nBetter maps!  Now, not going to say it's all roses (I really didn't like the temple, which is another extremely vertical level), but it's all a step up from the starting jungle map.\n\nMission choices! Past the first rank, you generally don't need to complete every mission to get to the next rank. Have a mission that's kicking your ♥♥♥? Skip it, then come back in a rank or two with a bigger, better gun.\n\nPros/Cons:\n+ Great pixel graphics.\n+ Great music.\n+ Great customization.\n+ Epic boss fights.\n- Horrible starting levels.\n- Control scheme that sometimes feels like it's fighting you.\n- Why can't I shoot diagonally? (Most of) the enemies can!\n\nOverall:\n+Worth the starting slog.","May 10, 2014","true","30.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If It would be possible, I would give this neutral.\nSo this game is basicly 2D run-shoot-loot platformer, and it accomplishes it well. The gameplay works well, though the default settings for keys were a bit weird for me. The shooting though could be better, because there's no diagonal shooting, but otherwise it works pretty well. The reload "quicktime event" is a pretty cool touch too, but I don't understand the bad bullet thing (makes half of the damage).\nLooting and moding your skills are the main thing is this game, like if you want to get somewhere, you have to upgrade your guns (with many ways). This is nice idea, but every level has a timer, which sometimes makes the looting and gathering materials really hard. Also, the missions themselves are a bit booring.\nThe enemies are mostly pretty okay. Not too easy to kill, neither too difficult to kill, but the placementof the enemies  feels a bit disturbing time to time. Like these flying robots appear while you try to platform to another place, guys with spears (a bit of more health than usual) are placed on small platforms, making it almost sure that you'll get hit etc. So far what I've stumbled boss fights, they're pretty okay.\nThe graphics are really nice. The enviroments are kind of cool looking, the NPCs and the player itself looks really nice, the little animals look adorable, and the ballistics are pretty nice too. Only a bit annoying thing though is that levels are maybe a bit too repeative.\nSoundtrack isn't really special, maybe a bit booring if you ask me.\nThe biggest problem of this is that it keeps crashing for some reason, which is really annoying.\n\nSo, summed up:\n+gameplay\n+crafting and moding\n+graphics\n+/-guns feel nice, but should have diagonal shooting change too\n-timer makes gathering materials hard on some levels\n-keeps crashing for some reason\n\n7,8/10","June 30, 2014","true","7.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It has a great retro aesthetic that moves and feels like an SNK classic. The most obvious comparison being Metal Slug of course. The music is good as well and captures that same era perfectly and is generally catchy and unobtrusive.\n\nMissions are boring and styled after MMO/RPG cliches of kill so many of this, gather so many of that, etc. and the big kicker is you can't double up on missions. Each one must be completed separately which wouldn't be unbearable if the game didn't re-use the -exact- same map for 10 or so missions. Meaning that you see the same map, with the same infinity re spawning enemies, far too much. Especially since there isn't much in the way of enemy variety nor are enemies challenging or satifying to eliminate. Even bosses are a bit of a bore considering the slower paced nature of the combat and the GoW style active reload system. Which in a better developed or more fully realized combat system would be extremely satisfying.\n\nThe game also makes a big deal out of the different gun parts and plethora of combinations possible but the sad truth is most are pretty worthless and to be frankly honest a base nearly unmodified pistol will do just as well as a custom designed toilet/saxophone/chaingun. Which sort of misses the entire point doesn't it?\n\nAll in all what could have been an excellent 2D  hybrid of Borderlands/Metal Slug/Contra became a tired chore of repetition. Maybe the dev team will go on to bigger and better things, I can only hope.","July 20, 2014","false","4.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

It is like that cool game you heard about but never played. Like you cousin told you about the NES Metal Gear's plot, and you thought it would play like Contra. You also made it look cooler than it ever would on the NES. You made the perfect game a violent 11 year old would want to play in the 90's. Not one a violent 11 year old would make, but one they would play. This game is pretty polished, even though it has a little to much grinding. Also this game really is not like Metal Slug at all, it's like Contra. Sure the art style and sprites are similar, but the game play is more like Contra with slower (not slow) gameplay than Metal Slug. Also despite all the different levels, you will play the same levels with the same robots, and the same backgrounds over and over again. This makes the game loses a lot of its luster long before you can actually finish the game. Some of the ideas are interesting, the hunting, the upgrades to the guns, and the supporting characters. These all have flaws though. The hunting is repetative and gives few real rewards. The upgrades are confusing, with some bullets not working after you change one part of you gun. The supporting charaters are basically just fun one-liner machines, and while I like them they should have more lines, or somethings. Currently they just feel very repetative. That really is the main flaw of the game, how repetative it is.  It should have had a few things cut, or more levels and enemies. It should provide hours of fun though.","May 3, 2015","true","21.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

All the old school charm, but none of the crappy controls. You get to build your own custom guns, upgrade your merc, and they didn't phone in the level content. I'm looking forward to trying the multiplayer.\n\nEDIT: Nevermind. This game is a chore. The gun thing is fine, but there is not as much customization as you might think. Most combinations just make crap guns. In order to use special ammo, you pretty much have to use parts wou may not want or that may take away aspects of the gun you like. I suppose this was done to keep people from making caustic longrang auto shotguns or something. The reload mechanic is alright. I still love the art and the gameplay is tight, but man the boss fights generally suck. Not the challenge or the pattern or the attacks! All that is fine! The problem is that they change locations. You pretty much get the first encounter to defeat them and if you don't smack them completely, in the first go, they flee to another part of the map, immediately spawn (if someone is there or not) and start going through their pattern. By the time you get to the location where they spawned, you get a few prescious seconds to attack them before they flee again. Now, you could leave the game running where they last spawned and eventually they will come back to that location, but that is boreing. So basically, it is a lame dynamic that greatly detracts from the game.\n\nThis is not just one boss- but one boss they use over an over again.\n\nAlso, the massive amount of levels are mostly repeats. I could have done with a more cogent/crafted set of story driven levels, one leading to the other, or an open world, or a big overworld map, but this constant revisiting of places I just wooped up on and finding them completely repopulated with bosses that flee and hostages and all that . . . jeez. This little war is being severely mismanaged. I understand that he is cloning soldiers and repopulating the levels, but come on! The same levels over and over again? Why not hit the cloning facility ASAP! Cut off supplies to the facility, sabotage the AA guns, drop some mercs in over the wall with that heli (or use a teleporter) and  de-CLAW the general! You have time to think about these things as you are running through a level for the 16th time chasing a coward in a jet.\n\nThe fix? Make more of the repeat levels optional and make the bosses only spawn in their next location when a player actually shows up there. That should only require an if/then check to see if a merc is in the battle area! Again, the game could be a lot of fun, but it is a chore, and thus, not fun. The more I play it the more I am disapointed, but I'll eventually finish just becasue I like Paul Robertson's art style and the action is pretty good.\n\nNiche fanbase.","November 18, 2013","true","23.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/destryu/recommended/218820/","destryu","DestryU","http://steamcommunity.com/id/destryu/","87 products in account",""Borderlands, Contra, and Gears of War had a baby - they called it Mercenary Kings and it's pretty. Now go away, I wanna keep playing it."\n\nMercenary Kings is hand drawn pixel art at its finest, brought to you by the same folks who rendered the Scott Pilgrim game. The art alone is enough to gawk at, making expert use of animations, sprites, silhouettes and the like. What's important about it, and why it deserves such attention, is because that EVERY pixel was lovingly and knowingly placed to give Mercenary Kings a very distinct look and feel.\n\nThe plus side is that when you start putting that much effort into every pixel, you start to care about where they're all going - the controls in this game are tight and responsive, especially if you play with a game controller. Layered on top of this are several fun and exhaustive features, including but not limited to active reloading, collectibles, and a unique brand of rocket jumping that involves a minigun.\n\nWhere Mercenary Kings falls short, however, is in its pacing and length.

Now go away, I wanna keep playing it."\n\nMercenary Kings is hand drawn pixel art at its finest, brought to you by the same folks who rendered the Scott Pilgrim game. The art alone is enough to gawk at, making expert use of animations, sprites, silhouettes and the like. What's important about it, and why it deserves such attention, is because that EVERY pixel was lovingly and knowingly placed to give Mercenary Kings a very distinct look and feel.\n\nThe plus side is that when you start putting that much effort into every pixel, you start to care about where they're all going - the controls in this game are tight and responsive, especially if you play with a game controller. Layered on top of this are several fun and exhaustive features, including but not limited to active reloading, collectibles, and a unique brand of rocket jumping that involves a minigun.\n\nWhere Mercenary Kings falls short, however, is in its pacing and length.

As much as it tries to paint itself out to be run and gun, it simply isn't. Too often you're forced to stop to jump kill an enemy, or wait for 3 or more cycles of a shield trying to kill you while you try and kill it. A vast majority of the enemies are simply slow moving or didn't move at all. I felt like I was grinding the beginnings of an MMO with no story.\n\nPlaying this game without a controller is hard and playing full screen hurts my eyes (that's less to do with the game and more the 2D medium.)\n\nThe pros are the customizablity that comes with the game. It was an unexpected twist to an old classic.\n\nSorry Tribute Games, I'm struggling to get past the first 45 minutes, and I doubt I'll give it the play time to see if it gets better.

The controls are sluggish, jumping is floaty and aggravatingly unresponsive, weapons either take too long to kill something or spend too much time reloading, and the entire experience is a slow-moving slog.\n\nThe underlying issue with this game is that EVERYTHING is designed to take far too long or is intentionally tedious.  There are many missions with mission timers 25 minutes longer or more, with the goal of just scouring each and every room to find weapon parts.  If this sounds like MMO fetch quests, you're right, and these missions are just as grindy, made even worse by the fact that you will do them on maps where you have ALREADY been through the map 4-5 times already.\n\nMovement speed?  Way too slow, even with light weapons.  Even the firing mode is lousy, giving you a pathetic 4 firing directions instead of the bog-standard 360-degree joystick- or mouse-based method that has been around for decades now.  The view frame is much too zoomed-in, meaning you frequently can't see where you're going, causing you to blunder into enemies or traps, as well as triggering incredibly excessive amounts of off-screen enemy respawns.  Map layouts range from mediocre to aggravating, with a great many paths hanging just over your head that you can't access unless you walk halfway across the map to a ladder or something.\n\nThe customizable weapons system SEEMED interesting at first, but it's both poorly balanced and based on grinding out items to get the items to make decent parts.  Machine guns have low damage and high magazines, making dealing with many standard enemies, and especially several bosses that have only limited vulnerability, very tedious.  Shotguns deal huge damage and have low magazines, with their "balance" mechanism being semi-auto firing; this means you spend HUGE amounts of time mashing the fire button, which is just plain ridiculous when they could have easily just left the shotguns as full-auto weapons for the simple sake of ENJOYMENT.  On top of that, many of the parts look different, but have minimal performance differences.  And even the bullet types are blocked off by forcing you to have the right level of compatibility with your current weapon parts, so custom weapon diversity is severely curtailed if you ever want to use different ammo types.\n\nThere are also dozens of missions, but without much actual variety.  Go fetch these crafting items, kill X soldiers in area Y, destroy this thing, and hostage rescue is about it, with maps recycled CONSTANTLY.  There is a severe mission bloat, with you doing the exact same things over and over and over again on the same levels to make the game seem longer/bigger than it is.\n\nThe perk system is also pretty poor.  Unless you enjoy scouring recycled maps for boss/target locations, you'll just end up slapping up on the perk that puts targets on your map, which, in other games, would be part of the standard game design anyway and you wouldn't need any sort of silly perk to see them.  The roll maneuver is almost entirely useless until you can get a perk to give it invincibility which, again, should've been a completely standard thing anyway.\n\nI could honestly go on, but it would just be redundant.  The artwork looks solid, but the game itself is mediocre and entirely third-rate, suffering from a whole raft of fun-robbing design choices.  Basically, unless you legitimately enjoy grinding out item collection for MMO-esque "make this weapon that is sliiiightly better than your current one", skip this game and just get the Metal Slug games.","June 7, 2014","false","11.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The in game map doesn't record where you've been, or where objectives are.\n\nAddded to this unfocussed gameplay, is the odd addition of Gears of War style 'active reload', which is just an annoyance, surprisingly bland and forgettable music, and a needlessly complex weapon upgrade system.\n\nIt all just feels like a bit of a mess, and is simply dull to play.

It looks great and the premise gives off the vibe that it's going to play like a Metal Slug, Contra or any other fast-paced 2D action shooter.  It doesn't and almost every aspect of the gameplay is poor.\n\nYou'll notice immediately the intentional jump delay.  I don't know why the devs were so tied into this mechanic, it's terrible in this type of game.  You can get away with deliberate jumping in some titles, but not this one.  The jump delay makes the game feel so off.  MK also has reloading.  Why?  I don't know and having to reload constantly brings nothing positive to the game.  There's also the issue that you have to press down to pick up items, and you'll have to pick up items constantly and it breaks any flow the game manages to create.  I wish the whole crafting angle wasn't even a thing because it doesn't appeal to me in the least and from I've read, it's not any good even if you're into crafting.\n\nSupposedly the game is super repetitive and grindy as well, but I didn't last long enough to find out.  If you're looking for some fasted-paced 2D shooting action on PC, you're much better off with the Metal Slug ports, even though DotEmu didn't exactly do a great job on them.","November 14, 2015","false","3.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

I play with the keyboard and don't like the controls, they don't feel natural and so I really had to get used to them. The missions are not very challenging more so annoying if anything. You just go around the map and have to collect a certain number of this or kill a certain number of that. The maps themselves are the same ones over and over again, there are maybe three different maps in total. The game gets really repetitive at least for me. One good thing though is that you have a lot of missions, I've played for about 6 hours and still haven't completed all the recruit missions and that is just the start. I really like how you can craft weapons with the materials you pick up, allowing you to make some pretty awesome and overpowered guns. The knives aren't worth buying, they don't give you much more damage than the one you start out with, and you will be using your gun for the majority of the time anyways since there is no limit to bullets, you just have to reload. All in all the game is pretty mediocre, it's pretty fun for the first couple of hours but gets boring quite quickly and I can't help feeling like I could be spending my time playing something more enjoyable.","September 24, 2014","false","7.1"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Mercenary Kings (MK) does borrow a lot from SNK's long running series (like rescuing hostages that say "Thank You!" after or the general look of the game), but it also borrows ideas from other games, like Metroid, Metal Gear Solid, and Contra.\n\nMK is best played through local co-op, at least so far to me. I haven't played it online with other folks, just my girlfriend and so far we're hooked. For a $10 game (on sale), I've squeezed 20 hours of gameplay out of it and we're not even half way done with all of the objectives.

It takes a while for the mission structure and crafting to click, and not all the missions are super well designed; map checking is often required (but easy), and the map is useless for a couple of off-beat missions.\n\nThe real meat of the game is building and customizing gun parts, but unfortunately since this requires materials, you can't jump right into making a gun, you have to play the first few levels, which are basically tutorials. And even once you can make a few gun parts, the guns don't get really fun until you start adding elements and special bullet types (freezing bullets, shotguns, bouncing bullets, homing missiles that pierce walls!) I feel the game would have been much better received if this were explained better and you got some materials to play with out of the starting gate instead of having to use the starter pistol for a few levels.\n\nThis is, however, a great chill-out game, and if you enjoy grinding materials and crafting there's plenty of that to do. People call it Monster Hunter crossed with Metal Slug, but the gameplay is a bit more like Mega Man (with a single, customized gun rather than switchable energy-based weapons). Bosses roam certain maps sort of like Monster Hunter, though the crafting and mission structure are really where the Monster Hunter influence shows. Unlike Metal Slug you have health so you don't die in one hit, but health is still a fairly precious resource.\n\nThe gameplay is surprisingly deep; gun weight affects how high you jump and how fast you move, you have consider how all of your gun's parts sum up into a good (or awful) weapon, and there's a bit of inventory management as you can only carry a couple healing/progression enabling items (but you can call for a couple more items mid-level).\n\nCo op gameplay is great--all players get all resources collected, so there's no fighting over drops. This also means playing online with randoms isn't quite as annoying as say Borderlands 2, because no one can swipe your rare drops.","July 7, 2014","true","46.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

That much is true, but there are parts that of play that are extremely tedious and annoying. Most if not all the missions are some sort of fetch quest that I've got to find something for. Neutralize mission? More like search the entire level fifteen times and you only have 5 minutes to do it and HOLY SH** WHERE IS THAT LAST SNIPER?! The gameplay is fun, cooperative play is fun as heck with friends, but the quests are massively just the same maps with different objectives, and the objectives are all fetch quests. Heck, you even have to search the level to fight the BOSSES.\n\nThe gun customization is fun to play around with (Trumpet toilet cat guns, as well as stabbing people with plungers) but that's a fetch quest as well. Wanna craft this super-cool looking plasma ultra laser trumpet toilet pewpew gun? Well, go find 30 pieces of diamond, 40 scraps of my leftover sandwich, additional pylons, fireworks, confetti, and a cake.\n\nThe gameplay itself is cool and all, but you need to find EVERYTHING TO DO ANYTHING. Go blow up this barricade. But first, go out into the jungle to find a random crate with C4 in it. I don't care if you have a full inventory, throw out those insanely overpriced first aid kits and grab A SINGLE UNIT OF EXPLOSIVES. And then go back and grab more explosives, because you can't have more than one at the same time.\n\nEnding the rant here and summing it up. Too many fetch quests. I still recommend the game, because it's amazingly fun with friends. But please to god, make more levels and get rid of most of the finding. Having to look for C4 to blow up a wall is pretty reasonable, just don't make me do it over and over and over again.","July 5, 2014","true","22.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/swaggerdaggers/recommended/218820/","swaggerdaggers","Fastest Honk in the West","http://steamcommunity.com/id/swaggerdaggers/","363 products in account","now that the game's finally out i can make another 1-sentence summary of it instead of actually reviewing it (but nah I feel like this game deserves some unbiased nitpicking instead of me ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on it and leaving)\n\nit's a game that really wanted to be contra mixed with monster hunter. It feels like the developers played and loved MH, but in the end didn't truly know why the features in MH made it what it is.\n\nWhen the kickstarter first went up one of the big things I laughed at was the fact that they wrote "add in a little monster hunter and you got our game" or something like that when describing the features. Now that the game's out, it's not immediately apparent, but it's true. Most criticizable aspects of the game stem from the fact that it wants to emulate Monster Hunter.\n\nThe missions are stale, primarily because they use the exact same 3 modes that MH has: kill X small enemies, gather X items on the field, or kill X boss monster. Rarely, the game will also have "talk to this NPC" quests also but that's negligible since they're just preludes to one of the other types of missions. They're meant to introduce the level by having you navigate it for specific area.\n\nAdditionally, upgrades and bonuses are gained through the same general "luck of the drop" system Monster Hunter is both rewarded and criticized for. This system is in place in Monster Hunter because the monster duels are not only fun but also dangerous enough to make players want to play it safe and stick to familiar tactics at first. Repeating the boss a couple times for certain drops, or changing weapon or strategy to try to get a drop that doesn't match your playstyle, are ways of making Monster Hunter more enjoyable. You get to see how the monsters are designed to act differently in different situations, plus with the tight combat already in place, it's a thrill either way.\n\nThat's not in Mercenary Kings. in MK, you dodge the same 3-5 attacks over and over, shoot the weak point (usually the back) of a boss, and eventually it goes down or is left open to capture. These nuances are found in MH as well, but aren't put there for the same reason. The lack of health bars in Monster Hunter is to encourage awareness in the player. They want you to look for signs of weakness, signs of battle damage in the creature you're hunting. a health bar would ruin the point of that. In Merc Kings, the enemy constantly flashes bright red when they're injured enough to be captured, so with zero subtlety, it just says you're 2/3rds done already.\n\nMonster drops in MH were to indicate playstyle in a way. You could only get the tail of a monster if you were attacking its back. You could only get the horns if you actually were able to smash the horns off with a kill, or if you could capture it with the horns perfectly intact still (meaning no face hits). MK is just pure percentile chance rewarding you for the kill.\n\n\nI don't HATE the game, because I still enjoy the simplistic gameplay and item grinding to some extent, but I think it's fine to like a game while also knowing it's full of developer mistakes.\n\nFor $10 I think it's a perfectly dandy 2D platformer monster hunter knockoff with full online co-op.","December 1, 2013","true","22.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

That all.\n\n-Sweet, SWEET "American Heroes" Theme game!!! Merceneries Kings Versus the Evil Army CLAW!!!!!! Cliche as f*ck, but for that reason is enjoyable.\n\n-The Empress is my waifu. Sorry King....[I'm not].\n\n-Metal Gear Solid Codec Transmission style. I love this game already.\n\n-The camp you and your fellow Team members use, is a nice break from the missions you accomplice.\n\n-OOooOOooooOohhh yeah!!! Lots of Guns and Knifes for you to use to annihilate your enemy! Also you can spend hours to create your own personal Gun. Who wants to use a Toilet-Snake Shotgun :3? Me, me, me!!!!!\n\n-Music......Oooh the music man!!!!! Is SO enjoyable I literally go to youtube to hear them all the time [my pleaser, my sin]. My favourite is this one. Just listen:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dadZJ5OQ0RY\n\nJesus the song is so damn good!!!\n\n-Good enemy and Bosses variety. From normal military soldiers to Giant Robot Dogs controlled by a dog with a eyepatch!!!\n\n-By the way, Eyepatch dog controlling a Giant Robot Dog is a Plus.\n\n-Enjoyable Death animations of your enemies!!!\n\n-Kickstarter Backers you must save from the hands of CLAW!!!! I love them for backing this game!!!\n\n-All the Map from the Missions are Gigantic and you will play them multiple times. However all the missions have specific routes you must strictly follow so you can finish your mission. Not because is the game linear, the opposite, you are free to explore the whole map if you like. The reason is the time limit you have.\nThe combination of Time limit  and the smart use of the map to complete a mission, is a perfect dose of adrenaline to make bumped with excitement. Music help a lot too.\n\n-Some interesting Cameos from other Videogames.\n\n-A giant secret you can find while you are hunting innocent animals :)\n\n[Cons]\n\n-Very cool Knifes for you to use, but sadly I didn't use them very often. Honestly, I only bought two knifes....I used them for the robot Dog Boss Fight.\n\n-Sometimes you must be very precise with your jumps. A failed jump, maybe cause you to lose precious time....\n\n-The concept to create your own weapon is cool, but only for a while. You will realised soon you will only buy the gun part to power your weapon, not to make it more beatiful. I am a little sad about that :(\n\n-The grinding for materials is painful sometimes if you want to create a specific weapon......\n\n-Random Spawing Spot of the Boss. Why the f*ck I need to seek the Boss in a Giant Map? Why? At least you will realised if you call a secret agent, he can tell you where the boss is.\n\n-My Biggest Problem of the game: If you don't kill the Boss quickly, the Boss will leave and find another spot in the Map....WTF!!!! Why did you put that gameplay merchanic here?!?!? Do you think I have the patience to run over the Map all over again just to continue a fight with the Boss?!?!?!? NNNNNNNOOOOOO!!!!!\n\n-Oh! And hear the best part!!!! If you are late to find the Boss in time to fight it once more, guess what? IT WILL LEAVE AGAIN TO FIND ANOTHER SPOT!!!!!! F*ck you game. I love you, but f*ck you!!!!\n\n-And guess what again!!!! If you combine the above with the limited time you have to finish a mission......you must play the mission again!!!!! I feel so much joy to play a mission for over 30 minutes again because the Boss was moving all the time like he was a tourist......NOT!!!!!!!!!!! -2 point!!!!!\n\n-Oh! I didn't expect that........what a twist.......*sarcasm*.\nThe twist was so painful obvious [for me], it was painful even for this kind of game...\n\n[Final Thoughts]\n\nA very good Platform-Action game which obviously loved by its developers and of course by the backers of Kickstarter. The Pixel art and Animation are top notch, the music great, the action delightful. I highly suggested for the people who love games like Metal Slug or Contra.\nSadly I must warn you: Even if the Boss Fights are awesome, it is VERY frustrating to hunt them down just only to finish fight them....I hope in a sequel the developers remove this gameplay mechanic entirely from the game. This is also my personal reason why the game doesn't have high score....\nBut I digress, it is still a great game. A must buy for the funs of the genre.\n\n8/10","November 5, 2014","true","30.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

Neither the steam page nor any gameplay video, now or prior to its full release, ever promoted this game as being similar to Metal Slug.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's come out and say what it is: this is Mega Man x Monster Hunter. The controls, level design, enemies, and gameplay are all explicitly cribbed from Mega Man, while the mission design, gear crafting progression, and boss mechanics are lifted from Monster Hunter. You accept a mission, from something as mundane as killing a couple mooks, to hunting two of a particular boss, and you're dropped into the level with the supplies you've brought with you. Certain supplies can be gathered in the field, as can materials, and you traverse the rather sizable level completing your objective, after which you return to base, where you resupply, craft guns, knives, and skills, and select a new mission. Much like Monster Hunter, this game encourages cooperative play, so rev up the online or bring along a friend, or you're quickly going to find yourself frustrated by how long later missions take to complete.\n\nIf that sounds at all appealing to you, by all means, pick it up.

And in a sense I think it's justified for most. But to others who like this kind of gameplay, its a gem. If you played any of the monster hunter games, you will love this charming addictive game. You collect materials and turn them into gun parts, then turn gun parts into custom guns. The difficualtiy curve in this game is very mellow, but does spike up some after you beat the main objective. If you love Megaman, or Metal Slug, and/or Monster Hunter; you will love this game. Play with friends to further enjoy the experince of this game.  I should also add, for those of you out there like me, the game runs GREAT on a low spec computer.","December 3, 2014","true","21.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Mercenary Kings (MK) does borrow a lot from SNK's long running series (like rescuing hostages that say "Thank You!" after or the general look of the game), but it also borrows ideas from other games, like Metroid, Metal Gear Solid, and Contra.\n\nMK is best played through local co-op, at least so far to me. I haven't played it online with other folks, just my girlfriend and so far we're hooked. For a $10 game (on sale), I've squeezed 20 hours of gameplay out of it and we're not even half way done with all of the objectives. We're having a blast playing this -- splitting up on missions to accomplish multiple objectives efficiently or teaming together to take down a nasty boss. It's very fun.\n\nThe music is really catchy as hell, too. Has that NES/Genesis vibe to it and you'll be humming the songs in this game at work every day because they get stuck in your head. The art direction is really nice, too. If you liked Scott Pilgrim The Game, this is up your alley.\n\nEven at full price of $20, MK is worth the admission. If you have a friend to play with, do not think twice about purchasing.","December 10, 2014","true","44.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I think I'll always love hot hearts.\n\nDefinitely not Metal Slug, though.\n\nThings I didn't enjoy: wanting to build a particular gun, only to realize I need to craft it using materials I have to keep finding throughout the game. In that sense, the grinding gets pretty boring. However, the use of achievements (like speed running the levels) make the grinding arbitrarily less annoying.\nPersonally, the use of a good gun renders the knife not very useful in situations.","December 12, 2014","true","80.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VultureBike/recommended/218820/","VultureBike","Ernie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VultureBike/","240 products in account","I could just gush about this game.\n\nSo, the game has a timer built in so you know how fast you're going. It also tells you how fast you were compared to the previous best in a mission. That alone makes the game super great to me. It lets me know when I'm improving at clearing missions.\n\nThen there's also the mechanic of moving faster* in exchange for being unable to shoot because you're rolling.\n\nThen there's the ability to change the gun you want based on like 30 gorilion differnt parts (accurate estimate). The gun customization made me so happy. Just having some itty bitty pistol WITH A GIGANTIC SNIPER RIFLE barrel is so endearing. They also give you detailed stats about the gun parts and you can determine which are better. There's also different ammo types based on what proficiency your weapon gives you. So many possibilities. So good.\n\nSomeone told me there's a story in the game, but I didn't get a chance to read it because my want to keep the action going is infinitely in excess than my want to read text during the cutscenes.\n\nThe graphics aren't anything super technically difficult, but it's for the best. I couldn't imagine playing this game with some ridiculous 4k resolution rendering off of the unreal engine or something. The game is perfect with these graphics. It cuts down on load times by a lot and really gives the game a certain feel to it that makes it very nostalgic to me. That isn't to say I don't like high res super hd graphics or anything, but this game knows what's best for it.\n\nThen there's the soundtrack that never gives off a different read into how you should be playing the game compared other games that might just use an overtone of low bpm music for some generic atmosphere.\n\nI also should mention that there's a good deal of inventory management in this game. It's not terribly important, but it will come up during times you want to be light so you can move faster.\n\nKeep in mind that this review was written before the official release because the great GabeN, though steam, and Tribute Games, the creators, let this game available for Early Access. So even with the full game not being released, I'm having a blast and I cannot wait for the full release. I've always got an urge to go back and play some levels I did before, but I don't want to burn myself out on this game before the release of the second half of the game. Not so say that's necessarily possible, though.\n\nAll-in-all, this game is great. It supports online multiplayer as well as single player play. It's got terrific mechanics and isn't a game that you should miss out on.\n\n*I don't think you're always faster when rolling. I'm pretty sure 2 sprinter mods with base extra light makes you faster or just as fast.\n","December 24, 2013","true","107.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Defeinitely gets repetitive quickly, though.\n\n\nRight away this game kinda jumps back to some older gameplay styles, it's highly intuitive. It teaches you some of the base mechanics right away in the intro, but it doesn't really give you the whole bag, it kinda makes you figure the rest out, which I personally enjoyed. There were a lot of "I can do that?!" moments throughout gameplay.\n\nThe platforming works really well, and the controls feel responsive enough. The design is a real eye catch, everything is gorgeous and so lovelingly animated. It's highly reminiscent of Metal Slug in a lot of ways. The actually gameplay feels a lot like MS, and the atmosphere is similar in a lot of ways too. I actually started to pick up a few silly references to MS, and other games similar, including Metal Gear Solid.\n\nBoss fights at first were kind of a pain in the ♥♥♥, though once I got the swing of things, they again became very intuitive and doable. They brought a Monster Hunter feel to it in how you had to track the bosses around the map.\n\nLast good note I'm giving is the weapon crafting system. That ♥♥♥♥'s fun. Nothing gives a more personal feel to combat when you yourself had to scrounge up the pieces and put together your own weapon. Their are so many different pieces, and it's all together a very nice touch. It could have easily been replaced with weapon drops and no one would have noticed, and that shows the care put into making this.\n\nNow onto the negative: It's REALLY ♥♥♥♥ing repetitive. You have set stages per rank of mission and you keep going back to those same maps continuously. This was kind of my deal on Peace Walker, though it wasn't nearly as bad there since the maps cycled more frequently. Here, you end up dealing with the same map per chapter.\n\nLast thing I'm gonna mention, I saw a few rags on storyline. I kinda didn't feel like the story was all that important here, given you're a mercenary. The characters all had a bit of personality, and your actions felt like they mattered to the world, so it was good to me.\n\nTo conclude, 8/10 would recommend.\n","August 1, 2015","true","8.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mr_Bluh/recommended/218820/","Mr_Bluh","Mr. Bluh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mr_Bluh/","68 products in account","The Good:\n\n- I grew up playing NES and SNES platformers, and so I truly enjoy seeing this art style popularized again. For what Mercenary Kings offers in terms of gameplay, the art style matches up nicely and makes the game feel cohesive.\n\n- Mercenary Kings offers a plethora of weapon customization options. The abundance of options enticed me to spend hours mixing and matching parts across different weapon categories in order to perfect a gun suited to my specific play style.\n\n- Surprisingly, the game has a entertaining story with multiple twists. Mercenary Kings was definitely improved by this because it justified playing through the absurd amount of story missions (112 unique missions in total) in order to reach the conclusion.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- I loathed how Mercenary Kings portrayed their women antagonists and protagonists. The overt objectification only served to reflect that the designers are out of touch with where modern audiences are in terms of gender relations.\n\n- The mission structures, goals, and levels in Mercenary Kings are extremely repetitive. While the goal might change between missions, you’re frequently placed in the same level to achieve this objective. Additionally, the objectives also lacked diversity - for example, often you’re collecting an object, neutralizing an enemy, or capturing a specific enemy.  Unquestionably, the central problem of Mercenary Kings is quantity over quality.\n\nIn order to acquire the necessary number of parts to construct banners, ornaments, gun parts, knife parts, and mods you’ll have to grind far too much.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nMercenary Kings looks like a Metal Slug clone (this is actually the reason I bought it without first researching the game), but it is far from that. The gameplay is much slower, and the RPG elements take center stage as opposed to a straightforward shoot ‘em up action adventure. I can’t recommend this game at full price. I purchased this game for 1.00 (humblebundle), and I had fun, but after the first ten to twenty hours it became an endeavor to simply complete the game. However, because of what I paid, I didn’t feel cheated.\n\n6/10.\n","September 14, 2015","true","45.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Want to make a machine gun that shoots wall piercing rounds or a pistol that shoots guided missiles that split on contact?\nWell... you can.\n\nThe gameplay is really good, movement, jumping and shooting feels really nice. The jump in this game requires some commitment since its hard to change directions once airborne, kinda like classic castlevanias but not that extreme.\n\nThe Bosses feel good to be taken down and have a nice variety (not counting color swaps), and thats nice since you will probably be fighting them more than a couple of times for its drops.\n\nThis is an awesome game if you dont expect it to be a metal slug clone.

What’s harder is to give it a twist that makes it a game of it’s own. In Mercenary Kings you craft weapons, armor and mods with loot you pick off of enemies. This is not just for giggles though, the game is hard and you need to craft your own chance at winning.\n\nPlaying as a team of up to four is a lot of fun, but the scenery is repetitive and even annoying when you are trying to kill a boss and he runs off into another part of the map.\n\nAwesome art and funny dialogue in a somewhat monotonous gameplay.

I figured "Hey, it looks like fun, it's multiplayer, and it looks similar to Metal Slug" In some regards it is, but in others, it's a whole other beast. First, I'll draw the similarities.\n\nWhen you first start up Mercenary Kings, you'll notice, "Hey, this plays a lot like Metal Slug" (if you're familiar with the series). Controls are a little strange at first, though I'd recommend changing them, but once you get down to the nitty-gritty stabby-shooty, you don't seem to notice as much. There's the familiar, arcade-style run-and-gun type gameplay that you'd expect from the screenshots, but what really makes this game unique is the differences from which the game breaks the stereotype.\n\nThe crafting system is extensive that sometimes it can be overwhelming, but if you're the type that loves to tinker around and figure out what works best (which varies, depending on the mission), or if you fancy yourself a virtual gunsmith, then you will love this crafting system. A few RPG elements are added in that there are a few stats to keep in balance as you prepare for each mission, but other than that, there's not too much else to the game. I do, however, really like the way multiplayer (both local, on one machine, or over the Internet) is handled. From the in-game base camp, players can join their friends or find other players online and team up to accomplish missions seamlessly (think drop-in/drop-out style, but only for this one area).\n\n\nIn short:\n\nPROS:\nExcellent and fun selection of weapons\nFamiliar gameplay style feels fresh\nSeamless multiplayer matchmaking - You can find a team rather quickly, and if they leave you, there's no penalties to you. (A big bonus!)\nLots of pew pew pew\n\nCONS:\nControls can be a bit awkward at first. I felt like a noob who never played arcade games before\nCrafting system can be a mite overwhelming for players who just want to jump into the game\nMissions can be repetitive if you're grinding for crafting materials\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game, it was worth every penny.","May 31, 2014","true","95.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

In my opinion this title is best described as a mix of Mega Man and Monster Hunters all while being skinned to have the appearance of Metal Slug. If you don't have a friend(s) to play this with the missions can definitely seem less fun and  more drawn out as you will have to do all aspects of a mission by yourself. Even with that being said, you will probably still feel like a savage when you have killed two bosses, saved all the hostages, and set a new fastest time all in a single solo mission. Nontheless, having competent team mates is awesome and the most fun experience as the multiplayer is where this game truly shines. Mainly because of the fact you can split up to wreck missions more aggressively and faster since you will be able to cover the various terrains more strategically, and more efficiently overall. Like they say, "four brains is better than one" lol.\n\nMy only true gripe with this game is its lack of controller configuration. I personally play this game  on a Fightstick (arcade styled joystick). So while my controller worked right out of the gate the button layout was all wrong. JoytoKey and Xpadder would usually fix a problem like this, but for this game it doesn't. The game will just continue to read the controller inputs and the keyboard inputs at the same time which will make you have binded actions you literally don't want. To fix this I actually had to go into the .CFG file this game made for my controller and switch around the button ID which took forever to figure out, This should be fixed honestly! Tribute Games just let us configure our buttons properly not just our keyboards please. Also, since I dont have a "right stick"  on my controller of choice I can't scroll the map either lmao. Another way to scroll the map would be nice too.\n\nEven with the controller and map issue I am having. I still have a blast running and gunning destroying everything in site, finding rare items and feeling like a super bad ♥♥♥ savage when my friends and I are all doing different things at the same time to bring a mission together like a true Mercenary.

I'm going to give this a no, but if I could I would simply give this a neutral vote or both, and if you can stand the grind then it's quite a lot of fun I feel, and would highly recommend it to those with sufficient patience to enjoy this game. I'm only giving this a no cause I personally couldn't stand the grinding. Honestly, my biggest problem with this game is that some materials are just way too hard to get in any kind of significant quantities. To get around this problem I suggest having higher tier enemies drop rarer materials instead of the common materials I already have literally hundreds of that all the lower tier enemies already drop. Also, the netcode could use improvement.

It has amazing graphics done by the talented Paul Robertson, who did all the graphic art for the Scott Pilgrim videogame, as well as making many entertaining videos featuring his sprite-work.  The whole feel is very retro and it really feels like you are playing an arcade game.  I personally donated to the Kickstarter of this game because I heard that guy was going to be in charge of the graphics team.\n\nI'm currently reviewing the build based off of the early access version, so I don't know if some of the issues I've noticed will even make it to the final cut, as this game updates almost every other day.  I've noticed the AI can be really dumb at some parts, but it does not detract from the game, because there have been dumb AI's in almost any game ever made.  This game is one of those games where you can end up spending a lot of time without realizing you just spent a lot of time doing things.\n\nEarly on you're basically just grinding for parts while learning the game and getting a feel for the controls.  You start out at an early rank, and by completing mission objectives such as gathering x amount of items, hunting x person down, freeing x hostages, or killing a boss, you slowly begin to branch out into the meaty bits of the game.  Now the fun part is as you begin rescuing key people, they get added into your camp and you are allowed to use all those parts you have been gathering to upgrade your character, whether it be their guns, knife, or special perks.  This is where the game detracts from the Metal Slug genre, and into its own special category, as you can mix and match gun parts to create a weapon that you love to use.  Each part usually has a drawback, but they also usually have an advantage too, so it evens out (so no gun combination is really overpowered as far as I can see currently).\n\nInstead of finding power-ups like in Metal Slug, you just create your own weapon of choice.\n\nI have not tried the multiplayer yet, but it sounds like it could be really fun as long as latency isn't too much of an issue.  The game looks and plays beautifully and it's not even currently out of beta yet.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone that is looking for something different to play.

Enemies spawn exactly where they were previously, and for a lot of reasons that makes the game unentertaining and to be frank a bit routine. Also enemies that flee do so until they despawn about 5 meters from where they started.\n\nA better idea for the game would have been to set a certain number of creatures per level, and have them move freely around. Write scripts for aggressive enemies allowing them to hunt you with a certain range. Every enemy killed should drop a item (or maybe you'd have to kill a group to get something). Basically take the tried and true method from monster hunter - you hunt things, they hunt you, the victor gets some spoils.

I mean in this game you do not really need to grind , you just get the materials while doing the main mission.\n\n\n\nSo this game is really good, i would not suggest you to buy it if you wanna play it alone, it can be done yeah if you love to solo your games you might enjoy it, but playing with friends is much more fun, Note that playing alone and multi has the same missions so there is no ( Omg the game is impossible to do it alone ).\n\nThe average of players playing this each day is 250-270 , so if you have no friends who owns this you might be able to find some random steam players , or go to forum to set a game up\n\nSo far i have not encountered any bugs or anything wrong with the game , my friends and i enjoy it so much , and we have some (Offline local-coop) game time, so steam only shows 4 hours but i think we have around 7 hours on it.\n\nIF i found any bugs i will update the review\n\n\nTL;DR\n"Such a great 2d shooter game to play with friends , so much weapons , a lot of customizing , and hard and fun missions to keep you and your friends entertained"\n\n10/10 , Get this game , watch some youtube videos and be the judge, dont believe those negative reviews.","January 3, 2015","true","5.1"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","2"

In less than an hour of playtime, the game managed to show every possible hint of amatuerism in its design. A design based on games from decades ago that had better control schemes.\n\nThe biggest flaw with this "game" is the incredibly poor design decisions. The first mistake was the addition of reload for what should have been a relatively simple run-and-gun experience. It breaks the flow of gameplay and often just leaves you huddling behind some barrels until you've reloaded. Not that taking cover matters; The enemies barely move and the barrels are always taller than you are, so you have to jump into enemy fire anyway. This is compounded by absolutely byzantine level design that makes backtracking endless and goals impossible. It doesn't help that enemies respawn faster than this game being pushed out the door. On top of that, the game often imposes time limits on your escapades. The result is endlessly frustrating. The "developers" clearly haven't taken much notice in the games they were so intent on emulating: You can't shoot diagonally. Even Contra, a game released in the late '80s, allowed the player to shoot diagonally. There's no reason this could not have been done here.\n\nMercenary Kings is so bad I thought it was an Early Access title because it has no features and is overpriced. It looks like someone took a game with one level and no interesting game mechanics, gave it a nice art style and called it a day. Normally, I would cut the devs some slack, seeing as it's a Kickstarter and probably their first game, but the pricetag is just insulting for the amount of content (that I've read about; Apparently there's a useless crafting system). Only a Kickstarter could raise $100,000 for a game to be $20 and have the same content as a gif of the opening and closing animated sequences. The lack of gameplay coherence and common sense gives me the sneaking suspision that the game was mostly an ego trip for an art student.\n\nI don't recommend this game at full price. I don't recommend this game on sale. I actually got it on Humble Bundle for a dollar and I still can't recommend it. No, wait, my brother paid for that bundle, so I got it for free. No, wait, my brother owes me twenty bucks. I got paid to play this game and I still can't recommend it.","March 6","false","0.7"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","11","23","2","0"

Borrowing heavily on the Metal Slug formula, the gameplay has been updated to current "standards": added replay value, massive crafting system, customization or sidequests just to name a few. If those are not inherently bad, they are not well suited to an arcade-y scrolling shooter.\n\nIf blasting through ennemy legions is your thing, be prepared to spend most of your time gathering materials by doing the same missions over and over again in order to get better weapons or equipment, some of which are not luxury items or hoarders' prizes but much needed firepower. Completionists will cry tears of blood.\n\nI would rather have had a two to three hours fun ride than having to grind my way through the game.

A crafting system that doesn't give much of an opportunity to experiment or preview weapon builds before spending your resources and too many stats to compare, very little incentive to really use different types of weapons or ammunition when caustic bullets pretty much handle everything. Reload mechanic is frustrating and disrupts the flow of the game, game does not pause when your viewing the map leaving you vulnerable to the reappearing enemies that may lurk off screen. Retrieving items from your backpack is slow and also disrupts game play you should really be able to toggle through items with a single button click rather than having to hold down a button then navigating a menu and then select your item, you also have go through your backpack to get the walkie talkie out just to call someone so you can leave a mission so many clicks for such a simple thing.\n\nI wanted to like this game but I just couldn't get over the frustrating gameplay mechanics.

Now to be honest, I haven't gone through the entire game as yet. But I figure that I've logged in enough game time on it to give some first impressions.\n\nAdmittedly, what initially drew me to this game was the design itself. It was like Contra meets Scott Pilgrim-- similarly designed sprites, chiptune music and such... so it was something of a guilty pleasure.\n\nAs a run-and-gun game, there's nothing TOO exceptional about it. The levels are fairly linear, even though there are plenty of nooks and crannies to explore. The story line is okay, though the characters are amusing enough that the plot doesn't plod on.\n\nThe real challenge lies in trying to master the levels. Not just in the speed-runs, but also with the secret objectives. Things to help you earn the extra scratch and materials to forge new items to not only make the missions more interesting, but to also unlock hidden perks to get through some of the harder missions.\n\nMissions are basic in nature, but can vary in difficulty due to time constraints and game AI. And the game AI is basic enough to make taking enemies out both easy and frustrating at the same time. There's also the reload feature, which can boost damage, but requires you to pay enough attention to be a distraction at times.\n\nAll in all, this is still a fun little run-and-gun, and definitely worth the look when it goes on sale.","November 19, 2014","true","27.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This game was nothing like Metal Slug, except it's also a 2D side scroller. But this game brought me back memories, it felt more like the old school Megaman, rather than anything else. But best part? Customizations, that's what made this game even better.\n\nThe personalizations, the mix and match weapons.

The controls are airtight and if you keep dying over and over,  you have no one to blame but yourself, and the jerk who put you down.\n\nThe co-op is fantastic, and makes the game so much more enjoyable and lessens the burden of some of the more punishing levels, so if you have a friend to play with, do so!\n\nThe gun part collecting is where the game truly shines though, every little mod added or taken away can either turn that ordinary shotgun into a fire breathing dragon, or break it so even your knives seem like a more viable option.

The game ought to have more that one way to obtain certain critical materials, or it should have difficult end levels that would justify some resource grinding.  The good (boss fights) outweighs the bad.\n\nPS- I notice a fair amount of reviewers calling the game difficult, but those ones are wrong.

I also played this split screen on a 36" HD monitor and thought it was a little too little....a single group map would be fine or no map below would be even better.....I play 10 days on Don't Starve before I start thinking "maybe I need a map..."\n\nKid thinks it's crazy fun too. His big complaint is "these bad guys keep beating me, are you kidding me?" I personally like the challange but he'd like a throw back to the time when a screen is shared and the hardcore gamer in the group blasts the faces and he passes out the heals (he's a good TF2 medic and a good collector of crafting items....he also got me out of a few hairy situations where I was reloading and thinking I was about to die). He likes Metal Slug more.\n\nOverall a very positive experience and I look forward to playing more. So does he, he cried his eyes out when I told him it was time to stop playing and go home. Great game, hope there's some cheap DLC or a modders tool-kit around the corner.\n\nHap Hollys","December 21, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I am on Chapter 3, but have only seen 5 stages.  The data files have 10 stage BGMs suggesting limited locations.  Missions are repeatable and are very forgiving if failed (you keep what you collected).  You also pick up loot drops for weapon and item crafting. These features combined with the "Hub" between missions gives the game a co-op MMO feel.   Less Contra, More Borderlands.\nNot at all bad, but if you are not expecting that, the game feels slowly paced.  Also be aware that weapon crafting feels like a crap shoot at first, as you can make underperforming combinations of parts.   Expect to make a bunch of parts and then experiment.  Tried to make a rifle and thought I wasted my money, turns out I didnt have a matched barrel and magazine to make it shine.\n\nOverall, I expected something closer to the arcade style Metal Slug, but this game is really, really fun.  It also has some fantastic chiptunes.  I have not tried Multiplayer yet.

It honestly reminds me of the old Syphon Filter: The Omega Strain where there is a mission objective and players can do their own thing to work together to accomplish it.

Yes it isn't Metal Slug, but just because it looks like it, it shouldnt play like it. This a Metal Slug style with a Monster Hunter vibe to it. The ability to customize your gun into any shape or form is the drive to this game. Now unless you wanna unlock every gun part, yes it WILL be a grind, but if you know what you want, you'll blaze through this game. By want I mean, you know what kind of gun you'll want to make. Spread patterns are all the same (this aint Counter Strike son), so a gun with 90% Acc will be the same across all fields, is just the ammunition that affects the pattern (Buckshots will not follow the same predetermined path as a Magnum Bullet). The only downfall this game has is there is no seamless map, you'll have to do different missions to go to the different maps. You will be doing the same maps over and over a couple of times, but you will be doing different parts of it to complete objectives. This can be a good or bad thing, as the missions are planned out so you know where to go for the main boss of the area (As bosses can/will run away to different parts of the map, and will need to know how to get there from previous playings). I find this game enjoyable, as others not so much, and for vain reasons.\n\nPROS\n-Customized Weapons\n-Variety of Parts\n-4 Player Co-Op (Both Online and Local)[Unknown if it can be mixed]\n-Great Boss Battles\n-Rainbow Dog of Doom that craps rockets at you\n-Large Maps\n-Shared Items in Co-Op mode (When finding, not crafting)\n-Tougher Enemies in Co-Op mode\n\nCONS\n-Low Replayablity\n-2 Characters\n-Enemy Variety is low (In the beginning)\n-Farm to Unlock all Parts\n-Few Maps\n-You will hate Rainbow Dog of Doom\n\n\nPretty even list of Pros and Cons, but my experience with the game as been fun, and I have been playing Solo. I think the Pros outweigh the Con in my experiences, this not a game for everyone. If you want a Metal Slug game, then buy, its there in the store, just do it. If you want a nice Side-scrolling, Action Platformer, with Customizable Weapons, I would get this.","December 29, 2014","true","19.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's a bit too arcane to figure out how it all works together at first glance.\nAbout the best thing the game has going for it is Paul Robertson's visual flair (because, *ahem* bewbs). Unfortunately because of the gameplay hindrances and for me, the periodic crashing, it wears out its welcome quickly. Nice idea, crowd-funders, but please try again.

And even after doing the same missions over and over again, you feel as though the game isn't hard enough.\n\nAnother issue is that there is no difficulty option. You have to start the game easy and than work your way up to the harder missons; but by the time you get to the hard missions, the game just feels easy because you've already got better guns and better armor. So bascially, the game feels the same, throughout; with the exception of some bakground changes.\n\nAll missions take place during the same map, depending on the ranking in which you choose (i.e. if you choose the first rank, all your missions take place during the jungle; and so on, and so forth). Only differeance is that some missions have a larger map, while other missions don't.\n\nBosses can just leave whenever during the battle, which is annoying; because they move to another part of the map so you might need to backtrack to the start and/or find their new spawn; before the time runs out.\n\nThe game is trying to be a "Run-N-Gun" but contradicts itself by allowing players to create a sniper rifle build. So you just stand where you spawn, pan the camera to the right and take out people from a far, and just free walk. And even than some of the enemies are bullet-sponges, so it takes a couple of shots to even kill them.\n\nAlso the knife is pointless. It does low damage and you rarely use it, with the exception of an achievement or two. It relfects bullets, but if the enemy is higher or lower than you one by 1 pixel, you'll still get hit. You're better off just shooting and ducking.\n\nI wouldn't recommend getting it at full price, but if it's on sale, its a decent shooter, that can be fun to play with others who don't really want to do much.","December 29, 2014","false","5.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's also just kind of a pain to play. You can only shoot in the x and y axes and movement isn't the smoothest or the most intuitive. It could be better, I think. Also enemies respawn the second they go offscreen so backtracking is a pain. Most of the missions are just fetch quests, which can get old pretty fast since they make for rather boring missions.","December 31, 2014","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Most missions tend to drop me in at the beggining of a level, give me an objective and say, "have fun". While this does sound good on paper, the utter size of the maps, difficulty of the enemies (this wouldnt be so bad if you diddnt have to backtrack so much), and the big penalty for death (which DISCOURAGES exploration, something a game like this NEEDS) all stacks up to make this game feel sloppy.  Everything could be cleaned up with the integration of a minimap, or even a little dot marker that points to the goal, and to tone down the enemies a little more.","December 31, 2014","false","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BFab/recommended/218820/","BFab","DarkSparx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BFab/","86 products in account","I'm trying... so hard to enjoy this game.  I really, truly am.  I want to enjoy it.  It's actually pretty cool!  Controls are (mostly) tight, some of the music is catchy, the art style is lovely, and it's awesome for local multiplayer.  Plus I adore the weapon building system, aside from it being a little cryptic.\nI just have a few complaints outside of that.\n\nThis game is VERY player-hostile.  Outside of the tutorial you have VERY LITTLE explained to you, and that's just not okay.  The first time I found an adrenaline shot I was stressing out because I had absolutely no clue what it did, only to find out when I accidentally rolled into a spike pit and died.  I thought it was a small health boost, but no, it's a revival item, and it's ESSENTIAL for co-op if you're inexperienced.\nBy the way.  This game also doesn't spend a second explaining co-op.  Not one word is spoken about it anywhere.  You have no way of finding out how it works other than looking it up online or figuring it out for yourself.  Bad.\n\nSecondly: Difficulty spikes.  Just...  Why?  Why would you do that?  There's nothing wrong with making a game gradually more difficult.  It doesn't have to jump up all at once like this one does.\n\nThird, I think a couple of the bosses could use some tweaking.  I'm not as far into the game as I could be, but I still feel at least a little justified in this.\nEvery boss should have a pattern that's easy to see, no matter how difficult.  A couple of the bosses in the game, yes, that's true.  But then there are other bosses that seem like they're impossible to figure out, and then when you do figure them out, it's impossible to avoid taking damage from them.\nAnd then there's one boss in particular that literally can't touch you if you just stand on the edge of the barrier.  Seriously.  All you need to do is dodge every so often and you will not get hit.  That makes something that's supposed to be dangerous a mere waste of time.\n\nI also think that the weight system could use some work...  It's okay if it affects your movement speed, but it shouldn't affect your jump height.  There were one or two occasions where, I kid you not, I actually got stuck and had to quit a mission because the gun I was using was too heavy.  Being weighed down into moving slowly is fine.  Just don't mess with the player's aerial mobility.  That doesn't work for a platformer.\n\nAnd the elevators.\n*sigh*\nThe elevators.  Once again with the player-hostility.  You are not told how elevators work.  The first time I saw them, I thought I had to move far enough away to trick them into moving, then jump on, because they don't move when you're close or standing on them.\nAfter driving myself crazy over it for about fifteen minutes, I eventually figured out that you're supposed to press up or down while standing on an elevator to get it to move, depending on where it can go.  This is extremely awkward because there are times when you're standing on an elevator and need to duck to avoid incoming gunfire, only to send the elevator down with you on it.\n(Also, to jump down through an elevator, you hold up and press the fire button.  Why?)\n\nTo sum it all up, long story short, tl;dr, would I recommend this game?\nNot at full price.  It's not worth $20.  If you can get it on sale for $10 or less, I'd say check it out if it's your type of game.","March 5, 2015","false","55.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Pixelated but colorful art, old school with a modern touch, etc... that's all truth and likeable. But I really had a problem with the gameplay, something that should be a star in this kind of games.\n\nFirst, this does not play like Metal Slug in an aspect. May look like it, but is more like a cheap megaman knockoff. Yep, I'm this harsh because the scenarios and platforming is filled with lame and boring challenges, timed repetitive missions and enemies that are just not fun to fight.\n\nWeapon crafting is still pretty good, and it may intrigue you what you can build with what you find, but honestly, this is the reason I usually don't dig in this kind of mechanic: I have to wade trough repetitive gameplay until it's grating. I might be compensated with building great guns and upgrades, but with such lame enemies to fight, what's the point? It's like playing XBlades in a Turrican-Megaman uninspired perspective.\n\nIf you want to play Metal Slug, it's here on steam.

I've no clue as to why people find this fun so much as you enjoy going to the same stage, you will also fail most missions the first time on a map since the map system itself is quite horrible. And as for weapon crafting all I truly remember was the pure tedium of crafting said weapon that usually is very unfun to use so instead of having these awesome powerups in Metal Slug which freshened the game up all you are left with is a tedius item screen and one weapon that usually took you hours upon hours of grinding the same stage.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/recommended/218820/","genoforprez","genoforprez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/","385 products in account","I can recommend this game, because I've been having a fairly good time with the basic gameplay... BUT.... a concession to the cautious buyer: the longer you play, the initial fun level begins to diminish as you begin to notice how the game extensively recycles assets and mission types. Mercenary Kings is perfectly content to repeatedly send you off on the same 3 types of fetch quests in one of the same 3 maps, over and over, again and again, for hours.\n\nMercenary Kings is the equivalent of that FPS you play that isn't really outstanding, but also isn't bad, and turns out to be a really great way to just kill a half an hour. It's a game you can hop into quickly, and missions can take anywhere between 5 minutes up to 30 minutes. If you're just looking to kill some time shooting a couple dudes while looking at some great pixel art, then Mercenary Kings fits the bill marvelously.\n\nIf you're a fan of old school side-scrolling shooters (e.g. Metroid, Contra, Gunstar Heroes, Cave Story), etc, then you're probably going to enjoy this game well enough to make it worth the purchase (especially at a sale price). There is **EVENTUALLY** (very, very eventually) a variety of ammo types, and it can be interesting discovering how different ammo types can have unique effects on certain types of enemies (e.g. when you shoot an enemy hiding behind a riot shield with caustic ammo, the riot shield melts away and changes the enemy's behavior).\n\nHowever, I specifically say AMMO types and not GUN types for good reason. One of the most loudly advertised aspects of the game---and definitely one of the most attractive---is the ability to pick up various "materials" dropped by enemies, which you can then sell for money or use at crafting stations to create new parts for your gun or various other perks. The game is very proud of these mildly RPG-esque and clearly Borderlands-derived elements, but the implementation is hit or miss. The ammo types are implemented pretty well. The gun parts... meh.\n\nAfter dumping over 10 hours into the game (and having a fairly good time, mind you), and experimenting with different gun mods, my honest opinion is that the vast majority of craftable gun parts and passive skills are more or less pointless. The game undermines upgrades and customizations in the vast majority of cases by giving an upgrade with one hand while stealing it back with the other.\n\nFor example, suppose you currently have a clip size of 8 and a damage rating of 150, and you want to upgrade your clip size to fire more shots before stopping to reload. The game might let you upgrade your clip size to 12, but it knocks your damage down to 100 and slows your walking speed. Suppose you decide to skip the clip size upgrade then and just upgrade raw damage? The game might let you boost raw damage to 200, but it will reduce your clip size to 4 shots and slow your walking speed. Or it might alternatively lett you have the 200 raw damage while reducing your magazine size to 7, but the cost is your reload speed is now three times as slow.\n\nIn short, most of the unlockable weapon parts aren't so much "upgrades" as much as they are like sliders that you can use to change CHARACTERISTICS of your weapon, but which don't really IMPROVE your weapon overall.\n\nAlso, you CAN'T SHOOT DIAGONALLY in this game. Which is annoying, because enemies CAN shoot diagonally, and flying enemies will attack you from a diagonal direction. This is a terrible oversight. It might have been fine if being attacked from a diagonal angle wasn't such a problem, but the game makes you wish for that diagonal aim through enemy behavior suggesting that you should have it, and then for some reason, you don't. When I noticed that, I shook my head and I said hm. Just hm. Tsk tsk. What a shame.\n\nThat being said, once you get several hours in and get up to about the third rank, you start acquiring weapon parts that make your gun compatible with elemental ammo. Therein lie the REAL upgrades. You can even get up to a point where you can have an elemental version of a specific bullet type. For example, you can create a gun that shoots bullets that are both CAUSTIC and also PIERCING. Caustic bullets burn away at enemies (and sometimes melt away their defenses) while piercing bullets can travel through walls and objects to hit unsuspecting enemies on the other side. Piercing bullets can also travel through several enemies in a line. And, of course, the damage is better. Now THESE are upgrades.\n\nIn short, the various weapon parts don't add a whole lot outside of letting you use custom ammo. The custom ammo is the real game changer.\n\nThere are other craft stations not related to weapon crafting, but these also don't offer anything that significantly improves your character or game experience. Some of them are terribly pointless. One of the better examples is the ability to craf better armor, which provides a definite and noticeable boost to the amount of damage you can sustain. The craftable passive skills, on the other hand, aren't particularly interesting. They COULD be, but are implemented poorly. For example, there is a passive skill that brags it can burst your speed, but at the cost of some of your physical defense. Again with the giving with one hand while taking with the other. If the benefits made the trade-off worthwhile, then it might not be so bad, but the "speed boost" you receive is so slight that I found myself turning it off and on again to test whether it was actually working. Not exactly the sort of "speed boost" I would sacrifice defense for.\n\nSome of the crafting options I even find downright ridiculous. For example, you can give a bunch of your materials and some money to the chef who will craft a meal for you, which gives you a perk in the next mission only. But the perks are laughably negligible. Things like a 5% increase to maximum health. Five percent? This kind of thing could just as well not exist and I wouldn't even miss it or notice it was gone.\n\nHonestly, I played all the way up through Corporal rank using the STARTING weapon. No mods offer significant enough changes to be worthwhile up until that point. I bought a lot of the upgrades to advance toward some of those skills that unlock with a certain number of purchases, but I didn't equip any of them. Didn't see the point.\n\nThe game's hugest and most serious problem, however, is recycling. I have played the game for 10 hours and completed nearly 50 missions. All of these missions have taken place in the same 3 levels. I am very sick of the jungle.\n\nOn the plus side, the boss battles are pretty fun (but also recycled).\n\nTLDR: Mercenary Kings  isn't going to win any awards, and it recycles too much, and its weapon customization is mostly talk, but if you just want to spend a few minutes shooting some 2-dimensional dudes while looking at some great pixel art, then Mercenary Kings is a great game to kill time with.","July 5, 2014","true","10.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

All those things are great... but the gameplay.  EVERY mission is a timed variation on a fetch quest, and most of the environments look the exact same.  Timed missions ALONE would dissuade me from continuing, but I kept at it because I really wanted to like it.  I figured weapon customization would save the game, but alas, unless you make very specific weapons, they tend to be pretty worthless.  I was hoping for a Loadout-esque customization system, but the game really just wants you to buy parts to make a shotgun.  Or a sniper rifle.  If you get creative in any way, the negatives are so huge that it's not worth the effort - I went from a standard magazine weapon with 6 shots to a larger magazine, and my damage dropped about 80% - so though I had more bullets to a clip, I was doing far LESS damage with each shot.\n\nIf you can handle mazey fetch quests, give it a shot.  It's a solid backbone, it has a lot of things going for it, but it just felt too clunky and grindey to me.  Such a shame, I'd been looking forward to playing it for a while now.","July 31, 2014","false","3.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's not the sort of Borderlands-meets-MegamanX that I was imagining.\n\nThe Merc characters feel clumsey and sluggish.  The guns (so far) are very limited ( "shotgun type parts" or "machine gun type parts").  It's common to sink missions-worth-of-earnings into building a worse gun.  There are no items or abilities aside that make you feel awesome, give any strategy or variety.  You're (so far) just a dopey run/jump/duck/shoot/roll character, fighting the same 10 enemies with predictable patterns and no real reason (i.e. relevant loot or an xp system) to grind through.\n\nEnemies feel like they're just in the way of the objective, fighting through the same stage over and over to complete their many missions.  A lot of time is spent hoping that the effort it will take to, yet again, trek through the same grid of caves, cliffs and structures, will be worth a few lines of character dialogue and the assumption that all the stuff you've been picking up will be useful some day.\n\nThe story, characters and artwork are all very pleasant, but the game mechanics/design makes most of the game a chore to slog through, unfortunately.  No randomized content.  One stage of the same stuff for hours.  Beyond that, I can only guess the formula repeats itself.\n\nPerhaps after only a few more hours, something along the lines of interesting/useful weapon options, character abilities (wall jump?  double jump?  wall slide?  crawl?  lock on/aim? Grenades? ect.), more stages, or anything else that feels like a reward will emerge.  Until then, it's just chasing repeat bosses that move before you even get to them for hours, and grinding through armies of annoying bad guys for obscure matterials.","December 20, 2014","false","4.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

UNTIL YOU READ!! SERIOUSLY!!!\nIf you are expecting this game to be like Metal Slug, Metal Assault, or Contra. Turn away right now. The game is better with Controler (HIGHLY RECOMENDED) With Keyboard, it is hellish to play.\nSo this game seem to have something new to it's style, unlike METAL SLUG. This game offers Crafting weapons, buying items, character customization and varrious mission to play. Not to mention online co-op for friends to join.\n\nSO WHAT WENT WRONG?!\n\nLevel Design choices\n\nUNLIKE METAL SLUG, this game is a CHORE! Most of the mission is  fetch quest style mission. The first mission was finding ONE hostage. (seems okay) Then the game do the exact same thing for second mission WITH 8 HOSTAGES! By the way, it's on the same map. (OR it look very similar, which make the game feels repetitive)\n\nYOU DON'T FEEL LIKE A BADASS!\nThis game is more difficult than Metal Slug, GOOD! However..., the game refuses to throw any retaliation! (I'm going to compare this to Metal Slug again.) In Metal Slug, you will encounter TANKS, 10+ Footsoilders, HELICOPTERs, and so on. This make the game fun, and give that satisfying feeling of destorying everything like any RUN n GUN game should be. But all you'll encounter in this game is just repetitive respwanable enemies. For example, sending 3 melee soldiers and die by 1 SINGLE BULLET. Or having 1 or 2 riflemen attacking you. Compare that to Metal Slug or Contra.\n\nSLOW EVERYTHING IS SLOW.\n\nThe fact that this game force you to do search n destory, or fetching an objective. Forces you to wonder around the map trying to find that LAST GUY WHO YOU MENT TO KILL. Again, unlike Contra or Metal Slug, this game doesn't proceed quickly. Infact, it probably force you to GRIND. That's right, having a crafting system is good, but you need to grind for the materials. I don't want to do that, this is not an MMORPG. The game does give you in-game money allowing you buy items. BUT NOT MATERIALS. NOPE YOU GOTTA GRIND FOR IT. May I ask why!?\n\nCombat Mechanic\n\nHonestly, very disappointed. I'll make this short. Why is there a reload mini game? Does it have any purpose? It was more like a punishment rather than FUN. I mean, reloading itself is already difficult. Or maybe it's not difficult in this game? BECAUSE THE GAME HARDLY throw enemies at you! While it adds abit of challenge during boss fight, I find it more... annoying. There's no real reward for hitting the right time for reload minigame, but only punishment when you hit too early or too late. I rather just hit reload and just wait. Other than that the mini game mechanic, is a waste of space.\n\nFinal things I would like to add.\n\nWHY DO I ONLY HAVE A PISTOL!? Where's my nade?\nWHY IS THERE A TIMER!?\nWHY DOES IT COST MONEY TO DIE?! Isn't losing one life not enough!?\n\nFor PC, IF YOU HAVE NO CONTROLER! DO NOT BUY!!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/magikavin/recommended/218820/","magikavin","Magi Kavin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/magikavin/","445 products in account","I purchased this game when it came out because it essentially looked like Metal Slug, and I loved that series of games. Those were fast-paced and interesting. This game, however, is not. When I first started playing, I learned quickly that it had no joypad or mouse support. I can understand having no mouse support since you only fire in four directions. You could always use third party programs to play with a joypad, but joypad support is something that you find in pretty much any game on PC made past 2008 or so. It's probably the game's single largest missed opportunity.\n\nAnd the reason why it's such a huge missed opportunity is because the keyboard is possibly the worst method of playing. The learning curve is enormous on a game that doesn't need the complexity this game has. When you're not struggling with learning the eighty million keyboard shortcuts, you're going to be struggling to learn things like weapon customization. Which, by the way, is almost completely useless. It's a lot of work for little reward. Speaking of rewards, the missions in the game are glorified fetch quests and get tedious very fast.\n\nThe only saving grace of this game is essentially the online multiplayer. If you can find friends to tolerate the game enough to learn the basics and play with you, it can be fun enough to tolerate for a while.\n\nIf you love Metal Slug enough to slog your way through the opening hour or two, by all means, purchase the game. Otherwise, wait for a Steam sale that brings the game down to around $5 or so. 'cause, frankly, that's about how much the trouble you'll be getting yourself into is worth.\n\nEasily in my top ten games I wish I hadn't supported monetarily.","March 25, 2014","false","0.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","2"

This is not to say it looks bad, but for all of us that hope to see a giant crab with a cannon mounted to its back, your better off looking elsewhere. Where Paul Robertson's style worked wonders in the Scott Pilgrim VS the World game, in Mercenary Kings the visual just look boring and Robertson's bad habit of copying and pasting the same face on many of the women really shows here.\nThe gameplay is even less like Metal Slug and is more akin to being like Monster Hunter with it's weapon crafting system as well as the hunting and gathering aspects of the game. This wouldn't be something negative if it weren't for the fact that Mercenary Kings itself is  just boring to play. Now most games are repetetive in some way but most games also find a way to mix up the repetition in at least a small way. In theory, Mercenary Kings should be able to keep the gameplay fresh with its different types of missions, but as soon a mission begins the player will end up shooting the same enemies, collecting the same loot, meet the requirements, rinse and repeat. Sometimes there will be a boss type enemy to give the player something new to shoot but nothing honestly changes the overall gameplay and it really starts to become a chore throughout. It's a shame because Mercenary Kings showed promise with the team behind the Scott Pilgrim game as the developers, alas not all that glitters is gold and for that you can easily spend your $20 elsewhere. If you really want to give Mercenary Kings a shot though then wait for it to go on sale for at least $10 or lower.\n\n\n\nTL/DR Ver.: If you want a Metal Slug type game to get your fix just play Metal Slug or Alien Hominid.","July 21, 2014","false","3.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

After fixing that a friend and I tried quite hard to enjoy playing this. But we kept coming across glitches and bugs and just plain poor/confusing design choices. Apparently reviving someone sends them back to the start of the level???? Bosses will sometimes just decide to leave the battle area. If you get downed in a certain way you'll be stuck like that forever, requiring a restart.\n\nThe thing that made us just straight up stop playing was when we chased a boss accross an entire level, because every time we found it, it would run away. Sometimes it would even run away before we even got to it. We were sposed to capture it, so when we finally got it down to the point where it was flashing red (which we FOOLISHLY assumed meant it was low on health and ready to be captured) we throw the capture bombs at it andddddddd they literally bounce off and have no effect.\n\n:)","December 6, 2015","false","1.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I'm sure at some level this was what the developers are going for, a nostalgic game they would've liked to see, indisriminately taking the things we all loved about platformers etc.\n\nSadly, it's more like the best and the absolute worst aspects of games from the 8bit and 16bit era. It's as if the developers have learned absolutely nothing from modern game design. This game is extremely frustrating, and most of it comes down to horrible design and core mechanics.\n\nThe biggest issue I have apart from the bad overall design, is that while the developers have tried to combine many different elements from successful games, the overall experience is worse off than any of those individual games it tries to imitate.Some gameplay choices don't play well with each other and their attempt at syncretizing these becomes detrimental to the overall experience,\n\nI tried playing this game with multiple friends, and it's hard for me to insist on it when it's obvious no one is enjoying a single second of it.\n\nA real shame, but the era for frustrating pieces of ♥♥♥♥ that you just love to hate are over.\n\nHowever, if you're one of those people that is scourging through the reviews to find reassuring confirmation of why you'd love this game, and are desperate for the possible potential it might have I would in fact recommend this game. You might not play it for very long, but it does have an allure of enjoyment, one that it doesn't really deliver on, but afterall, like the developers, sometimes we like the idea of something over the actual thing itself.","August 6, 2014","false","2.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

This game does revisit the same areas. What it does right about this mechanic is that it will often lock certain areas of that map until you clear specific missions, and the variety of the missions more than make up for this.\n\nThe crafting and customization that a person can use to suit their playstyle is varied enough to suit anyone's taste. Homing guns, projectiles that explode with shrapnel on impact, piercing rounds, elemental rounds, and even player buffs that can make a melee build one of the most lethal.\n\nThe multiplayer co-op is the most fun feature of this game. Whether local or online, the players are free to explore separate areas of the same map, versus locking you in the same screen (as does Metal Slug, a game that cleraly inspired this one). The only negative part that players may find is that local co-op is split screen, so plan to be close to the screen if it is not a large one. Also, players can leave whenever they feel like it (even the host) without forcing other players to quit, and players can join at any point in between missions.\n\nThe most impressive ascpect of this game is the commitment that the developers have to ensuring that it is a great game. Their persistence in ironing out bugs is rare for an indie team. This is reason enough to buy the game, and to buy future titles from this team.\n\nGraphics are one of the last thing I care about so long as the game works, and it does. On that note, the art style in this game is fantastic.\n\nTL;DR: Lots of crafting and player build customization, varied missions, drop in/drop out co-op campaign, great art style/graphics, dedicated developer team.\n\n9/10","December 4, 2014","true","81.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Oh hell yeah!\n\nIf you're a Monster Hunter passionate, such as myself, you will definitely LOVE  this title. The feeling you get is very close, and a lot of mechanics are present in both games:\nWeapons can be forged, and they come in various shapes and colors. Not only that, but weapon parts are divided in categories which alter the way they work.\nThe main area is a small village, where all the NPCs live. Many of them also resemble ones from Capcom's franchise: the general who gives you missions, the cook who... erm, cooks you food (which gives fixed AND chance-based bonuses), the gunsmith who forges all your gun parts from monster materials, and so many others.\nAreas work similarly to how they do in Monster Hunter, being divided in zones and having enemies indigenous to them. However, in this game most enemies tend to respawn as soon as they leave your field of view.\nOh, and I didn't talk about boss fights yet! Bosses can be killed OR captured, and overall the pattern-learning process behind defeating them for the first time feels the same.\nThen comes CoOp. You can play together with up to four people, and you all share the same lives. There's a built-in voice-command system, too.\nI could go on, but I hope you get the point.\n\nIf, however, you're considering buying Mercenary Kings for the Metal Slug part, you'll be slightly disappointed: while it mantains all the glorious 2D shootin' goodness, it lacks a bit of the fast-paced and action-packed gameplay that makes Metal Slug what it's well known for. Also, there are no power-ups scattered around the map or dropped by your foes, for instance.\n\nOverall? I don't even know where to begin: some great but not overly complex pixel-art, an amazing soundtrack, interesting characters, an addicting gameplay and the CoOp mode are all important points that give a strong first impression.\nMaybe it's not really worth €20, but you should totally get it if it drops below €15.","April 15, 2014","true","36.6"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

The game that could have been good.\n\nMetal Slug meets Monster Hunter, how could that be bad? Easy. The development team is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\nThe game mechanics are slugish and unresponsive making the game slow and stiff. This becomes an issue durring the many glitched boss fights, fights that are nearly impossibly without a second players help to exploit the boss' patterns.  This is to say, the game is hard. But not hard in a way like Dark Souls or Mario, where it is your fault when you die, but in the most unfair of ways. A good example is a later level where there are falling platforms over spikes and offscreeen enemys fire at you durring your jump arc from one falling platform to another. Your options are get shot and take damage, or fall and take damage.\n\nThis is my issue with the developers. Between being too lazy to fix old content before adding in things nobody asked for like pizza statues for a tent that serves no purpose and pulling bull ♥♥♥♥ like making art and stories for each member of the playable characters team only to tell the players who bought the game excited to play as them that they are all dead in the story and the guy and girl characters are the only ones you can play and you should be happy about it. Oh, but they had enough time and money to make the sprite art for their own personal sprites for a circle jerk achivement at the end of the game.\n\nAll developer ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t aside. Is the game good? No. Any of the Metal Slug games are a better purchace for the same or cheaper price.

How about doing it with your own custom-made weapon using whatever mishmash of parts you can think of? If any of that appeals to you, then this is absolutely worth a shot.\n\nPaul Robertson's handmade sprites and backdrops do a lot to give the experience that retro/fake-retro charm without coming across as just pixelated for the sake of it. The soundtrack's combination of metal and chiptune-like tones calls to mind things like Virt's compositions for Contra 4 and DuckTales Remastered.\n\nOnce you get some momentum going, it's lots of fun crafting gun parts, bionic mods and even substitutes for your trusty knife, to put together your own personal loadout and see how it performs.\n\nThere's a couple hitches though. To me at least, the system of equipment weighing you down seems out of place, and the Monster Hunter-type layout of missions giving you different objectives in the same areas means it can get kind of repetitive, especially if there's a gun part or something you REALLY want to get the materials for.\n\nTrifles aside, it's a fine example of mashing together run-and-gun violence and strategic weapon crafting.","January 14, 2015","true","26.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It’s like the unusual lovechild of the aging, but still strangely attractive Metal Slug and its sleek, modern boytoy Borderlands, but being raised by the GGG Contra after Borderlands refuses to take custody of the child.\n\nLet me explain: You play as the Kings, a batch of mercenaries that were sent to Mandragora Island to defeat CLAW, a strangely Nazi-esque group conducting strange experiments in advanced technology and some-such. In the process, you die, but are revived with the help of a special Mandragora serum, developed by CLAW to make super soldiers. And that’s about where any semblance of plot lies. You have a cast of kooky characters that are little more than hyperbolized caricatures (Cute female weapons specialist? Check. Caffeine-addicted, one-eyed general? Check.

The basics of Contra, the humor and style of Metal Slug, and the customization of Loadout is what you will get.

No more compromising on which way to go first so that the other player doesn't get killed or stuck by the edge of the screen.  The only downside to it so far, is the time limit for each mission.

It features gorgeous pixel art reminescent of the 16 bit era, heavily inspired by the arcade classic Metal Slug, and a glorious chip-tune soundtrack.\n\nOne might expect Mecenary Kings to fully lift the run-and-gun stylings of Metal Slug given it's style and theme, but instead it actually picks and chooses a wide selection of mechanics from the Mega Man franchise. It notably draws on the Mega Man Zero and ZX series, with a wide selection of collected gems from across the earlier titles.\n\nThe game features missions with a variety of optional challenges that are a delight to revist with different armaments; the same level feels different when approached for speed or when explored thoroughly for resources, and players are well rewarded for become familiar with enemy patterns, level layouts, weapons and items.\n\nI was actually very surprised when I started joining in on multiplayer efforts with how wonderfully multiple players integrate, and just how diverse the weapon selection is among players. While it seems natural for players to gravitate to a single weapon layout to me, it turns out that there is little consensus between players on what equipment works best; clearly the weapon crafting system does an excellent job of addressing individual play styles. There is something for everone.\n\nThere are some short comings. It is difficult to construct weapons that utilize the unusual ammo types, generally forcing one basic gun type; stocks and sights don't really contribute much to weapons overall except to craft weapons for very specific ammo types. Biomods and Proficiencies are good overall, but there are a wide range of abilities that just aren't present. It's not that the options available aren't significant, it's just that there is a great deal of options that could be added, like modifications to rolling, or jumping (like double jumping). It feels a lot like the more unusual options aren't present for the certainty of avoiding game-breaking bugs or opporunities; it's not bad but it feels overly "safe".\n\nAlso, while materials within the game are broken down in to common, uncommon and rare drops, it isn't clear that this doesn't actually reflect the value of any individual drop. While boss drops are only obtainable in a few, or single locations, it's easy for a player to grind for one or two of those individual drops, where some "common" materials, like Rubber, Chromium and Regular Pins, are found only rarely but are required for a substancial amount of crafting. Players can burn an enormous amount of time digging for some less interesting items like Scarlet Pelts just to craft a few basic items.\n\nMercenary Kings is a game I fully believe exemplfies the ideals of the Indie Game development community; deserving high recognition. And the end credits drop hints for a sequel, which cannot come soon enough; my hope is that it will carry the existing bar of excellent, and push further by promoting more dramatic, more experimental gameplay options. That said; even just an expansion of new maps and enemies would be well worth my time.","May 24, 2014","true","93.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I hope that this review will help you make your decision. The game is certainly not for everyone, but I will go into it's pros and cons shortly.\n\nFirst, I would like to adress many of the complaints I have seen in other reviews.\n\nMany seem to think that the controls are clunky. This is true- at first. after 30 minutes or so of gameplay, the controls seemed natural to me. If they really bother you, you can always remap them quite easily. I also read many reviews which stated that the jumping seemed unresponsive. The only time I have noticed this is when I have attempted to jumo when in a prone position (laying down). Otherwise, the jumping mechanic seems just fine to me.\n\nSome also complain about the reusing of maps. I can certainly see why some people may become irritated by this, but it doesn't bother me. Since you're always completing a different mission, the maps do not seem too repetitive.\n\nLet me just say that Mercenary Kings is a fantastic game that deserves a lot more attention than it is currently getting. The retro-style gameplay combined with the endless weapon customization makes for one of the most enjoyable gameplay experiences I've had. The character animations are worthy of an award, and the maps and backgrounds look fantastic. I'm not too far into the campaign, but so far it has been fantastic. At first, it may seem overly difficult, but if you just do some part swapping with your gun, you should be fine. I will update this review with some of my favorite beginner weapon setups soon.\n\nThe only thing I have found irritating about this game is the lack of a chat menu in multiplayer games. This is extremely minor, however, and will most likely be fixed in a later update.\n\nOverall, I would highly reccomend this game to anyone looking for a great retro-style gaming experience. It's well worth the $20. I hope this review was helpful to all of you ladies and mentlegen.\n\n13/10\n\nLet's kick some CLAW!","June 21, 2014","true","44.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you've ever played or seen Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World The Game on consoles, you've seen some of this guy's work already. The basic gameplay works fine enough with you jumpin', runnin', knifin' and shootin' (not diagonally though) through an assortment of levels with a bunch of goodies hidden about. When you get into the groove and master the controls it can definitely trigger some nostalgia from cartridge/arcade cabinet days of yesteryear.\n\nThe BadTo deck out those guns and upgrade your gear, you're going to have to do quite a bit of grinding for ingredients (random drop or otherwise). Expect to revisit a bunch of areas for this purpose and have to deal with monotonous mission objectives, time-limits and silly boss fights where you have to worry about tracking them down across the whole map to fight them some more until they die if you take too long. All while the timer ticks down in the background. No pressure to find your way to one of those boss arenas scattered about the maze-like maps while the boss periodically shuffles around (leading to some particularly cruel instances where you can finally make it to a boss-zone where it's at and it just walks away after three seconds) or anything. There may additionally be some problems with the game on certain monitors or comps but I didn't personally run into this myself\n\nThe UglyEven with this game's short-comings, there IS fun to be had. As such, there is definitely an audience or two to reccomend this to. Just be prepared to have a bit more Monster Hunter in your Metal Slug sandwich than you perhaps initially bargained for.

"Pixel-art"-like graphics are, in my opinon, a standard for this kind of games, and it suits very well with the features and gameplay it offers (even animated boobs, no jokes).\n\nGamplay\nEasy to learn, pretty easy to master (at least master on specific type of weapon / ammo). I personnaly used an xBox 360 controller from the very beginning, so I cannot relly talk about the Keyboard / Mouse controls.\nControls are intuitive, and even if it's not at the beginning, you really have the time to master it.\n\nMercenary Kings is quest-based, with a "Hunting ground" (aka time / quest-free zone) where you can hunt animals and such to get missings compenents for your gear.\nIt offers a crafting system for your guns. You have to build from components a parts of weapons, then you can assemble whatever part of any gun you like together, it will make a working gun (probably not as working as you expected).\nSome weapons have a certain "synergy", making you able to use special ammo (6 differents types) like shrapnels or rockets, and sometimes two of them at the same time (piercing rockets, omfg).\nYou can also build knifes, which I thought to be unless, does really matters from middle to end-game.\n\nThere's equipable "mods", which makes you carry more, run faster, shoot elemental bullets, or even makes you insensitive to certain elements.\n\n\nI don't really want to talk about the rest of the features, since it would probable spoil a bit.\n\nMultiplayer\nI didn't test multiplayer yet, I will update this review as soon as I tested it.\n\nGeneral impressions\nLike I said, probably the best Shoot'em up I've ever played. I did finish the last mission, but I would really enjoy play this more. There's a really great amount of quest, stuff to craft, secrets to discover, and all kind of things.\nI didn't find anything that really upset me here.\nI'm kinda sad I couldn't test multiplayer yet, but as I see it, it would be as epic as the rest of this game.\n\nNote: 10/10.

Think Monster Hunter + Metal Slug. You kill enemies which drop resources that you use to build parts for guns, build melee weapons, or make mods which give various effects. Granted, most missions are gathering missions, but there is a small variety. Sometimes you will need to kill a boss, or even capture it with Shock Bombs when it is low on health.\n\nYou only shoot in the cardinal directions, which I am fine with. It would be too easy if you could aim diagonally. The jumping takes a bit to get used to. Just as a reference, think Batman on the NES. The jump works almost the exact same. A slight delay before jumping, hold it down to jump higher, and once you're in the air you can alter the trajectory slightly.\n\nMost missions have bonus objectives, and every mission has Secret objectives which are only revealed once you have found/killed whatever the secret objective is related to. Bonus and secret objectives offer bonus money and resources.\n\nThis game is very grind-heavy, since you have to hope for resource drops, but it's much more forgiving than a lot of other games. Some missions offer a few of a specific resource, or the mission actually requires you find that resource. A simple look through the resource guide in the community hub can help you find that elusive resource.\n\nI'd recommend this game to any fan of Metal Slug-style games, or even just side-scrolling shooters. Hell, I'd recommend it to anyone, really. As always, if you're not sure, watch some gameplay videos of it.","March 26, 2014","true","31.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is classic style gaming at it's finest. It brings back memories of game arcades and early home consoles.\n\nThe mechanics are a bit primataive (no diagonal shooting) but the game seems well ballanced around that.\n\nThe story is also classic. You fight an evil organization bent on...world domination? Terrorists? Bad guys for sure at any rate. You start play as one of two previous mission/story survivors brought back to life by a specially formulated serum, which is probably why the island you are on was invaded in the first place.

Missions pay well the more successful you are, some even have bonus objectives. You can buy supplies (rations, first aid kits etc.)  to take with you into the field or chance finding what you need as you go.\n\nGames were never this complex in the old days since back then, it was all about the high score.

At first I was incredibly impressed by how polished and wonderful it looks (because it does - it has that fantastic Metal Slug feel to its presentation), and by how fun the simple gameplay is. It's a lot of fun to traverse the non-linear levels, and most enemies are pretty fun to fight and kill.\n\nHowever, after playing for a few hours, I started to realize how much content is recycled, and how tiring it got that every mission is just a fetch quest. On the same couple of levels. This hit especially hard when I played a mission where you have to hunt down a boss that keeps escaping to different points on the level, making him almost impossible to find let alone kill (I had to find him four times in random spots before I was able to wear him down). A few missions later, they recycled the *exact* same boss and level, with the only difference being that you had to stun and capture him or something.\n\nI really wish the game didn't have so much excess padding, because it could've been one of my favorite indie titles ever. I have a few other gripes, such as the fact that it's pretty bad at explaining how all the customization works, and if you finish the main objective in a level you get no chance to finish the secondary before leaving. Also, the reload mechanic slows down the pace a lot, and makes single-shot guns very unfun.\n\nStill, it's a strong game at its core, and tons of fun outside of the annoying moments. It's not worth its full price because you're gonna get sick of it pretty fast, but on a sale for like 3-5€? Sure.","March 28, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From the start you are given a game that is a mix of Monster Hunter,Metal Slug, and a dash of Gears of War. In theory this sounds quite awesome! In practice it shows how each one of these mechanics can work against each other.\nStarting with the Monster Hunter mechanic of finding loot to craft new guns, this forces the player to grind in a side scrolling shooter. At first it dose not seem to be an issue up until you face the 2nd boss in which kill you. Or in most cases, will time you out. Causes you to replay stages for better weapons because bosses in the game can run away from you if you don't kill them fast enough. Next is the two other mechanics described in which can work against each other.\nDue the reload mechanic you will be taking shots and you have no way to defend yourself. This could have been fixed with an instant reload rather than the timed reload. Adding another layer of frusteration. I tried going in wanting to love it. Even through the time on greenlight I tried holding hope. Sadly I can't say it is fun sadly. I give Mercenary Kings a 6.5/10.","March 28, 2014","false","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cascade_Range/recommended/218820/","Cascade_Range","Robot Maid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cascade_Range/","359 products in account","I've played this game for awhile, since Early Access. If you're a fan of games like Contra and Metal Slug, this is the game for you. The 2D run 'n' gun gameplay brings back that old retro feel for gamers such as myself.\n\nThe game itself is pretty solid with a decent bit of content. The game brings together two of my favourite games and meshes them together surprisingly well. The gameplay of Metal Slug with a gun crafting system that evokes the feeling of Monster Hunter. You even go on missions in a Monster Hunter-ish format. For those who aren't familiar with one or either of the aforementioned games, Mercenary Kings is a 2D side scrolling run 'n' gun adventure where you take on the role of "King" or "Empress", one of two members of the titular Mercenary Kings, a group of heroic mercs out to stop the dangerous organization CLAW.\n\nThe graphics, sounds, and gameplay all give that retro feel but retain mechanics not often found in older games. One such system being the crafting system where you can make an almost infinite combination of guns. Want to make a gatling gun that has the range (and possibly accuracy) of a sniper rifle that shoots acidic bullets? You can do just that. The mission difficulty curves rather well and, with over 100 different missions, this is rather impressive.\n\nThe missions themselves all follow rather basic procedures. Enter the map and fulfill objectives. These range from "neutralize" (destroying or capturing a boss target), "eliminate threat" (destroy all enemies within a certain area), "gathering" (find the specified quantity of a specified item), and more. While the objectives are more or less the same, the game manages to throw a few curve balls with special variants, such as bosses guarding target areas or different permutation of enemies in a given area.\n\nWhile this game is a great play by yourself, it's even more fun if you can play with friends. You and up to three friends can take on the evil CLAW! With this, even more possibilities open up. Do you and your friends split up and take on several objectives at once or do you stick together and back each other up? Will you all bring in LMGs and Shotguns in preparation for a lot of close quarters combat or will one of you pack a sniper and pick things off from a distance?\n\nBut not all is great for this game. While it's an amazing game either solo or with friends, playing solo does feel a little punishing. When solo, you may have to do some runs almost perfectly and that requires repeating a single mission several times (which can get dull). But with friends, it won't nearly be as bad, Missions like this, however, are few, and a little practice is always good, no?\n\nIt's definitely worth a look. This game may not be for everyone, but if you like arcade-y games like Metal Slug or Contra, this game is for you.","March 29, 2014","true","55.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd love to play that game.  That's not what this is.  You're not going to run around like a maniac blowing up everything around you.  What you're actually going to do is move carefully forward so you don't get hit, explore every corner of the map over and over, and ultimately get tired and give up.\n\nThe main gameplay loop is that you have to move carefully or take damage, which is *very* expensive to repair, and many of the missions involve finding 10 of something on the map...and there's only 10 to find.  And they're not listed on the map.  So you end up exploring the map over and over until you have 9 of 10 collected and you can't find the last one, so you end up going over and over the map, taking damage and dying until eventually you either run out of lives or out of time, and these missions aren't short.  You will put a HUGE ammount of time into these missions and fail them over and over.\n\nPlus you can't alt-tab out of the game, so you can't even look at FAQs or maps to help you.\n\nThe game doesn't make you feel strong, it makes you feel like a chump.

One part Metal Slug, with an inventory and crafting system, with that familiar 4 player game play.  Either for a 'serious' play, or casual, it's honestly fun.  Great old school handling and the soundtrack is a nice mix of classic bit work and modern rock.\n\nThe inventory and crafting systems are pretty simple.  You need X amounts of Y materials to craft Z part for your gun.  Plus some cash.  And for those of you who like to customize and build and have MULTIPLE gun builds? They have you covered.  Everything from pistols, carbines, assault rifles, shotguns, machine guns, toilets, and trombone's (to name a few), with elemental ammo, armor piercing, buckshot.  Lots of options here for scoring some ludicrous gibs (yes!).  OH and knives too. But who needs a knife when you can build a freakin' minigun?\n\nThe game handles well, overall. You move your character, and they get there.  Feels like something taken right out of an arcade cabinet and put into your hand with such simplicity it's nuts.  Any fan of the Metal Slug franchise WILL feel right at home here.  You needn't worry.  For everyone else?  This game is quick on the uptake.  You shall find no sloppy handling here.\n\nMy one issue is that the default input is a keyboard. I would highly. HIGHLY recommend the use of a game pad.  Otherwise the keyboard controls are a bit spaced out and kindof irregular.  The gamepad makes everything RIGHT at home.\n\nOverall, for a game that's in 'early access' it feels fairly rock solid and fairly 'done'.  Yet they keep adding to and tweaking the game.   And the price tag certainly makes this a worthwhile investment.","November 5, 2013","true","44.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

These materials you could use to upgrade armor (health), build mods (add effects to your character), and craft gun parts which you could then customize the look and functionality of your gun.\n\nSo far, it's only early access.  It only has 60 missions, but later will have 100.  Hopefully we get to see more options for your gun, like choose the shooting tiype (like rapid fire, spread, etc).

It's like Metal Slug with non-linear stages and customizable guns - and animation by the ever awesome Paul Robertson, no less! (Seriously, look up his hauntingly cute "Devil Eyes" or the balls-to-the-wall, all out INSANE "Kings of Power 4 Billion %" on YouTube.)\n\nI think currently the main draw of Mercenary Kings is the presentation - music, graphics, character designs - all very stylish and surprisingly polished. The gameplay does get repetitive, especially when you're just grinding for materials, but there seems to be a steady stream of new content gradually trickling in, as you'd expect for a game in development. The crafting system adds a layer of depth, as intended, but feels perhaps a bit linear in that there's really no reason to ever go back to an older piece of gear once replaced, and it seems that your best option is always to build every gun exclusively of its own set of designated parts - mixing and matching components from different guns is sub-optimal at best.\n\nBut the beauty of it is, of course, that this can all still change!

There are so many NPC's to talk to and get new items such as food that gives you temporary boosts, a place to buy usables in a mission such as healthpacks, a place to buy mods that help your character, and much more. Of course the best part of this game is the ablity to mix and match oarts for your weapon to make a gun that truly fits your playing style. Want a gun that acts like a shotgun but has a machinegun clip go ahead, want a gun that looks like a trombone, why not right.

The strong point of the game is the customization of the guns and a very workable multiplayer online experience (from when I played through it with my friend) but that is about it.\n\nThe game relies on getting materials to make weapons as the driving force for replayability. The missions take place in stages with very slightly different objectives, like fetch X amount of material, rescue X hostages, or kill X enemies in one specific area. The platforming feelings awkward and clumsy, but later levels shoehorn it in or damage must be taken by stage hazards. The combat feels slow as enemies feel like they have tons of HP for the sake of it (might have been from playing 2 man multi and always splitting up). Many of the bosses are elemental re-skins and any interesting ones come too late in the game and too infrequently for one to care. I feel this game is in an odd spot where it has the look and feel of attempting to be a game like metal slug or contra, but lacks the level design and style to do it. the gimmicky ammo is cool the first time or two, but doesn't really do much that is exciting after the small "ooo ahhh" factor is gone. 2/5","May 7, 2014","false","21.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With that in mind, here goes:\n\nThis game is side-scrolling run-and-gun at its very finest.  Tight controls meet challenging level design and enemies that aren't (always) simply mooks that charge at you full speed.  There's a very interesting crafting system that allows you to mix and match weapon components (receiver, magazine, etc.) to make a gun to suit your desired method of mayhem.  This same system also has in place "implants" which confer bonuses (and disadvantages too!)\n\nMy favorite part of the game, however, is that it takes item weight into account.  Weapon parts, implants, consumables you carry to battle, everything has weight and weight affects your movement speed.  This creates an interesting strategic balance: do you bring the massive crush-everything loadout, sacrificing speed in the quest for power?  Do you streamline to what you think you need and nothing else, trusting in agility and a quick trigger finger to win through?  Or is your path to victory somewhere in the middle?  This game doesn't judge, instead setting the options before you and letting you decide how best to assault its varying missions.\n\nAnd oh, the missions!  Not content with simple "run to the right and kill it if it moves" gameplay, the game will present you with sections of a whole area that will become familiar over time, but ask different things of you each visit.  Sometimes you'll be gathering items, other times it's search and destroy, still others your task is to seek out and rescue a captive (or more than one!)  The variety of tasks you take on keeps the game from feeling repetitive, instead rewarding thorough exploration and familiarization with each map with secret passages and hidden treasures, not to mention helping to get quick times if (when) you go for speed-runs.\n\nTL;DR = This game is a lot of awesome.  If you like run-and-gun sidescrollers and you like customization, it's amazing.","April 15, 2014","true","34.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I haven't encountered any bugs at all either. The game also features tons things to keep it challenging. Little babies who can't deal with a time limit or interesting reload systems on missions should go play a first person shooter. They made it so you can time your reload just right and get an attack bonus, you almost have to strategize in some situations. Do you wait to hit green and get a damage boost but risk getting hit? Or do you hit the yellow and pump your foes full of lead right then and there? The best way this feature works is with it's cover system. (yes, hitting down to duck behind a box should be considered a cover system) And the fact you can't shoot diagonally isn't much of a big deal either. The fact that enemies can isn't bad game design, it keeps you on your toes kiddies. Those same things happen in metal alug, enemies can shoot diag. and you can't. But the fanboys of the neo-geo classic will nit-pick Mercenary Kings all day for it not being an exact copy of M.S. The gameplay may be similar, but you need to walk into the game knowing the two games differ quite a bit. There are some RPG elements etched into M. Kings as well in upgrading your guns, armor and misc. equipment.  There is grinding involved, but that's part of the experience. Not everyone can be a badass overnight, you have to work for it. These are things you need to consider before purchasing the game however, you shouldn't blindly charge into the store and buy it because you think it's metal slug, because it's actually not.\n\nOverall, this game can provide hours of engaging gameplay and an experience that can be enjoyed by yourself or with your friends.","April 5, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some may describe it as a run and gun, but it has a much more deliberate pace.  While the learning curve may initially be a bit steep, the game provides a moderate challenge all the way through.  Rush or play carelessly and you will be punished.  The game expects you to learn the patterns of your enemies.  Positioning and purposeful movement are key.  The controls are crisp, but a controller would be highly recommended in this case.  I played using a Wii U Pro controller.\n\nIt is broken up into short missions which can usually be completed in 5-10 minutes each.  These missions are on a timer, but for the most part these timers are very generous.  However, if you are the kind of player who cannot stand having time limits you may want to avoid this game.  The missions come in a number of varieties.  Collect materials, kill a boss, clear out the enemies, or reach a destination.\n\nThe art is incredibly well done, the entire game looks great.  The sound track can be quite catchy too.  The presentation is superb in every way.\n\nThe gun crafting system is can be quite entertaining for those who like to tinker.  While initially the options are limited after completing a few ranks you can start mising and matching.  Machine guns that shoot bouncy balls, fire based shotguns, and electric homing missile machine guns are all possible.  You can find a weapon to suit your style.  While Shotguns and Sniper Rifles are a bit dominate in the early game as you progress pretty much everything becomes viable.\n\nIf you are willing to put in a little effort to learn the game it will be a solid experience.

Now that it is complete I can safely say that the money I've spent on this game was worth it (and I still haven't finished it). I haven't played Metal Slug, but who cares about that game anyway? Mercenary Kings is a deceptively simple run and gun game, until you realize that you will have the most fun grinding levels just to get that one last ingridient for the dream gun. You will laugh your pants off when you notice all the subtle or obvious nods to modern action cinema (one of the knives is called Trejo and it isn't a Machete, the Machete references a Federale Cortez).\nIf you are interested in the story, MK has one and it is as over the top as the rest of the game, especially if you wait long enough to see the intro (look out for the IV drip).\nIf you are still reading this you should stop, buy the game and play it. CLAW won't stop itself you know...\n\nTL;DR Version - Fun, Good Value for the Money, Long and Hard enough to be worth it.","April 11, 2014","true","37.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has the animation styling of Metal Slug sure but this is more along the lines of Contra/Castlevania. Platforming requires skill and forethought. The influences of Monster Hunter and Borderlands are evident. The crafting system being the basis of this game and the Borderlands influence being the weapons themselves and their parts.\n\nI will warn people now, this game is not for everyone. There's a patience to it, the run and gun occuring very rarely. It stands up more as a co-op shooter with everyone in their mother having ridiculous guns that shoot fire and cause people to explode all over the floor. This is late into the game though. It breaks down to first finding a style of gun that suits how you want to play, followed by working your way through it.\n\nThe questing system is exactly like Monster Hunter. Fetch Quests are plentiful but the farther in you get the more the game begins to open up and you start having to clear whole sections of the map. The time element only comes into play very early as they get more generous as the game continues and more so as the maps get wider. You spend time on every map and you begin to learn the different nooks and crannys of those maps as you go.\n\nOverall I recommend this game if you enjoy crafting, hard side-scrolling games and maybe a bit of animation. It has a story that's flat and a little eh but it does move along. Gameplay seems monotonous but that's mostly based on watching, playing, the hours tend to fly by. Its usually best to play this in shortish bursts as long stretches will become exhaustive I've found.","July 3, 2014","true","41.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At one point I was disappointed at the lack of new weapons as the game progressed but when I checked back again even that problem was solved with an update, the weapon count had probably doubled. So I made myself a couple of Magnum-shotguns (not making this up!), a pistol that would shoot armor-piercing shrapnel once the ammo was possible to obtain (It needs a material that doesn't drop yet, Quality Steel or something) and Anti-Materiel rounds that have yet to see a weapon that can fire them. Can't wait for the full game, I'll probably 100% it.\n\nTotalBiscuit described this game as "Metal Slug meets Monster Hunter" and I agree. The Monster Hunter part comes from all the crafting. Biomods, melee weapons, guns, ornaments... everything apart from your supplies has to be crafted from materials that drop from enemies and crates scattered across different missions and especially with some materials you WILL have to farm them. (Like those surprisingly special "regular pins".) The magnum shotguns I mentioned before required parts that only drop from big story bosses. Speaking of bosses, they are as classic as they get. Very punishing if you don't know what you're doing (the first time always hurts) but once you have their patterns down with some good reflexes it's as easy as breathing.\n\nThe keyboard bindings need some work but luckily you can bind any key to whatever you want. I recommend using a controller, though.","January 20, 2014","true","72.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But with RPG elements, like crafting your own prefered equipment. Sounds good right? Well this game is not very good. It is boring.\n\nThe problem is threefold:\n- you now need to "grind" materials for upgrades. And then you need to build a bunch of random stuff to unlock proficiencies. I got bored with this system and the available options about 10 missions in. Surely late game stuff might be nice and all, it is an unattractive system early on. Especially because you have no idea where you should be farming in the first place.\n- the maps are the same, over and over again. Same enemies, but that is not all, they are applied in a very repetetive way as well. Sniper on a ledge where you need to get close, rifleman jumping down on you, spearmen attacking from above, drill in a hole, metal drone when you zipline down. Repeat 20 times every stage. There, spoiled the first 3 maps, on which you do at least 3-5 missions each. Boring and annoying.\n- the "quests" you get to do are boring. Gather 10 of this. (random drops or in boxes, so walk around the entire map. Again) Go to this NPC. And even the Boss, which could have been interesting, is annoying and boring. He moves from the scene at random. So you have to go through the level you got to know by heart by now, AGAIN to find he moves away after just one attack, so you have to track him down AGAIN.\n\nOh and it gets worse: Then you get to do that boss AGAIN. Same map, same fight, but now you have to finish with a shock grenade. Which is the first time you get to use these, they are hard to use, you get only three, so then if you fail to get it right 3 times, you can just as well go and restart the map. After two runs so facing and beating this boss 3 times I had enough.\nNo more waiting in an infirmary for 50 seconds (!?!) to heal up, no more cleaning up / skipping the same enemies 20 times over and finding that you have 50/9 for one craftin component and 1/2 out of some random rare drop you never can seem to find.\n\n3/10, would not be bored by again.","July 7, 2014","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At a glance, it may remind you of Metal Slug - and, at a very surface level, it does bring you that feeling and experience, however, MK is far more than that.\n\nMK introduces several new and refreshing concepts to the classic run-and-gun platfomer.  As you defeat enemies, you pick up material drops.  These are used to craft weapon and armour upgrades, knives, and well as character "perks" if you will.  Though I'm not through the game, there are probably thousands of unique weapon configurations that can be created by mixing and matching different parts that you have created.  Armour upgrades are much more vanilla, a simple "material for boost" trade.  Armour upgrades are linear, and one-piece progression.\n\nWeapon crafting deserves a bit more talk.  The gun consists of several different parts, each of which may effect weight, range, power, clip-size, shot distance, reload speed, and special effect (armour piercing, caustic, electric, etc.).  Each part also has its own designed graphic which shows up as you play.  This allows some pretty zany and custom options for you to pick from.  You may also choose to build your gun as a "set" by picking each piece that matches the same name - there are some advantages to playing that way as well.\n\nAs for missions - there are A LOT of them to get through.  Missions are based on a few categories.  You've got your side quests and your primary quests, but they're also broken down by ranking.  You'll need to complete the main quests of one group before the next batch of missions are unlocked.  I can't see any reason to skip the side-missions, though, as you will collect a lot of valuable resources and cash to advance through the game more smoothly.\n\nThough the price of the game may seem a bit steep, you can really tell that A LOT of work has gone into creating this title - there's more content than I can list in one sitting, and there are PLENTY of missions to keep you going.  If you can't afford the $20, I certainly suggest grabbing it while it's on sale.  There are only a few games that have piqued my interest and hooked me in as well as this one has.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ACriticalHit/recommended/218820/","ACriticalHit","Ｃritical Ｈit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ACriticalHit/","313 products in account","Note: This recommendation was made in July 27th, 2013 during Early Access and this recommendation is only made in mind that this is NOT the final product.\n\nI've played a good few hours into Mercenary Kings. Overall, it is a fun game if you're into the Metal Slug kind of gameplay mixed with Loadout's Depth of Weapon Customization (changing head, body, bottom of a gun with sight + ammo) with the Monster Hunter's Mission Rule Set of 'Three Strikes and you're Out' and it's 'RPG-like' drop-rates. There are way too many guns to customize so experimenting what kind of gun you like is the fun part. Since this game focuses more on the 'gunplay' than any other part, if you are coming from Scott Pigrim vs. The World Video Game, the 'melee' part of the game is a bit lackluster since there are basically three different ranges of melee. Short, Medium, and SPEAR LONG. There's no 1-2-3 combo built behind them, it's only a melee swing.  The other issue is that exploring is a bit discouraging when it comes to examining what's inside the houses. 80% of examining the inside of a building results nothing. Followed by 10% Indoor Level that's fleshed out and 10% there's a guy you have to rescue in there! However, the outdoor exploration is vast and nice to roam around. Soundtrack is somewhat limited, but it's in Alpha state atm. Is it worth 15$ (current price)? If you really want Metal Slug/Run and Gun Retro-Style arcade game and miss Tribute, the same guys who made Scott Pigrim, sure give it a shot. Multiplayer makes it exponentially more fun without ruining the game. There isn't even an option mode at the moment so you have to adjust the sound through the Volume Mixer. The price tag for 15$ may sound a bit steep for the penny pinchers. 10$ would be fair, but prices excluded, the game does what it does right: Executes Metal Slug while adding Gunplay Customization that feels just right.","July 27, 2013","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BinaryViolence/recommended/218820/","BinaryViolence","BinaryVile-Tents","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BinaryViolence/","428 products in account","So what is Mercenary Kings?  One part Metal Slug, with an inventory and crafting system, with that familiar 4 player game play.  Either for a 'serious' play, or casual, it's honestly fun.  Great old school handling and the soundtrack is a nice mix of classic bit work and modern rock.\n\nThe inventory and crafting systems are pretty simple.  You need X amounts of Y materials to craft Z part for your gun.  Plus some cash.  And for those of you who like to customize and build and have MULTIPLE gun builds? They have you covered.  Everything from pistols, carbines, assault rifles, shotguns, machine guns, toilets, and trombone's (to name a few), with elemental ammo, armor piercing, buckshot.  Lots of options here for scoring some ludicrous gibs (yes!).  OH and knives too. But who needs a knife when you can build a freakin' minigun?\n\nThe game handles well, overall. You move your character, and they get there.  Feels like something taken right out of an arcade cabinet and put into your hand with such simplicity it's nuts.  Any fan of the Metal Slug franchise WILL feel right at home here.  You needn't worry.  For everyone else?  This game is quick on the uptake.  You shall find no sloppy handling here.\n\nMy one issue is that the default input is a keyboard. I would highly. HIGHLY recommend the use of a game pad.  Otherwise the keyboard controls are a bit spaced out and kindof irregular.  The gamepad makes everything RIGHT at home.\n\nOverall, for a game that's in 'early access' it feels fairly rock solid and fairly 'done'.  Yet they keep adding to and tweaking the game.   And the price tag certainly makes this a worthwhile investment.","November 5, 2013","true","44.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Went to go config controls and read them in menu, and was incredibly infuriated as to the process that ensued. Keys for reset, confirm, and exit were all bound in real time, there are no limitations on key conflicts, and sometimes the keys just seem to plain screw up. Had confirm reseting controls, reseting controls after rebinding reset controls would never reset, and there was no master reset option as well as controls being held outside of player profile. 2 minutes and I permanently broke my control setup, dear lord, resinstalling now. Great, spectacular, amazing game outside of that, but control config menu I would really head warning to using, or at least I hope they change some of these effects since they are a formula for disaster.","April 21, 2014","true","47.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With that in mind, here goes:\n\nThis game is side-scrolling run-and-gun at its very finest.  Tight controls meet challenging level design and enemies that aren't (always) simply mooks that charge at you full speed.  There's a very interesting crafting system that allows you to mix and match weapon components (receiver, magazine, etc.) to make a gun to suit your desired method of mayhem.  This same system also has in place "implants" which confer bonuses (and disadvantages too!)\n\nMy favorite part of the game, however, is that it takes item weight into account.  Weapon parts, implants, consumables you carry to battle, everything has weight and weight affects your movement speed.  This creates an interesting strategic balance: do you bring the massive crush-everything loadout, sacrificing speed in the quest for power?  Do you streamline to what you think you need and nothing else, trusting in agility and a quick trigger finger to win through?  Or is your path to victory somewhere in the middle?  This game doesn't judge, instead setting the options before you and letting you decide how best to assault its varying missions.\n\nAnd oh, the missions!  Not content with simple "run to the right and kill it if it moves" gameplay, the game will present you with sections of a whole area that will become familiar over time, but ask different things of you each visit.  Sometimes you'll be gathering items, other times it's search and destroy, still others your task is to seek out and rescue a captive (or more than one!)  The variety of tasks you take on keeps the game from feeling repetitive, instead rewarding thorough exploration and familiarization with each map with secret passages and hidden treasures, not to mention helping to get quick times if (when) you go for speed-runs.\n\nTL;DR = This game is a lot of awesome.  If you like run-and-gun sidescrollers and you like customization, it's amazing.","April 15, 2014","true","34.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Think Monster Hunter + Metal Slug. You kill enemies which drop resources that you use to build parts for guns, build melee weapons, or make mods which give various effects. Granted, most missions are gathering missions, but there is a small variety. Sometimes you will need to kill a boss, or even capture it with Shock Bombs when it is low on health.\n\nYou only shoot in the cardinal directions, which I am fine with. It would be too easy if you could aim diagonally. The jumping takes a bit to get used to. Just as a reference, think Batman on the NES. The jump works almost the exact same. A slight delay before jumping, hold it down to jump higher, and once you're in the air you can alter the trajectory slightly.\n\nMost missions have bonus objectives, and every mission has Secret objectives which are only revealed once you have found/killed whatever the secret objective is related to. Bonus and secret objectives offer bonus money and resources.\n\nThis game is very grind-heavy, since you have to hope for resource drops, but it's much more forgiving than a lot of other games. Some missions offer a few of a specific resource, or the mission actually requires you find that resource. A simple look through the resource guide in the community hub can help you find that elusive resource.\n\nI'd recommend this game to any fan of Metal Slug-style games, or even just side-scrolling shooters. Hell, I'd recommend it to anyone, really. As always, if you're not sure, watch some gameplay videos of it.","March 26, 2014","true","31.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You fight an evil organization bent on...world domination? Terrorists? Bad guys for sure at any rate. You start play as one of two previous mission/story survivors brought back to life by a specially formulated serum, which is probably why the island you are on was invaded in the first place.

At first I was incredibly impressed by how polished and wonderful it looks (because it does - it has that fantastic Metal Slug feel to its presentation), and by how fun the simple gameplay is. It's a lot of fun to traverse the non-linear levels, and most enemies are pretty fun to fight and kill.\n\nHowever, after playing for a few hours, I started to realize how much content is recycled, and how tiring it got that every mission is just a fetch quest. On the same couple of levels. This hit especially hard when I played a mission where you have to hunt down a boss that keeps escaping to different points on the level, making him almost impossible to find let alone kill (I had to find him four times in random spots before I was able to wear him down). A few missions later, they recycled the *exact* same boss and level, with the only difference being that you had to stun and capture him or something.\n\nI really wish the game didn't have so much excess padding, because it could've been one of my favorite indie titles ever. I have a few other gripes, such as the fact that it's pretty bad at explaining how all the customization works, and if you finish the main objective in a level you get no chance to finish the secondary before leaving. Also, the reload mechanic slows down the pace a lot, and makes single-shot guns very unfun.\n\nStill, it's a strong game at its core, and tons of fun outside of the annoying moments. It's not worth its full price because you're gonna get sick of it pretty fast, but on a sale for like 3-5€? Sure.","March 28, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From the start you are given a game that is a mix of Monster Hunter,Metal Slug, and a dash of Gears of War. In theory this sounds quite awesome! In practice it shows how each one of these mechanics can work against each other.\nStarting with the Monster Hunter mechanic of finding loot to craft new guns, this forces the player to grind in a side scrolling shooter. At first it dose not seem to be an issue up until you face the 2nd boss in which kill you. Or in most cases, will time you out. Causes you to replay stages for better weapons because bosses in the game can run away from you if you don't kill them fast enough. Next is the two other mechanics described in which can work against each other.\nDue the reload mechanic you will be taking shots and you have no way to defend yourself. This could have been fixed with an instant reload rather than the timed reload. Adding another layer of frusteration. I tried going in wanting to love it. Even through the time on greenlight I tried holding hope. Sadly I can't say it is fun sadly. I give Mercenary Kings a 6.5/10.","March 28, 2014","false","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're a fan of games like Contra and Metal Slug, this is the game for you. The 2D run 'n' gun gameplay brings back that old retro feel for gamers such as myself.\n\nThe game itself is pretty solid with a decent bit of content. The game brings together two of my favourite games and meshes them together surprisingly well. The gameplay of Metal Slug with a gun crafting system that evokes the feeling of Monster Hunter. You even go on missions in a Monster Hunter-ish format. For those who aren't familiar with one or either of the aforementioned games, Mercenary Kings is a 2D side scrolling run 'n' gun adventure where you take on the role of "King" or "Empress", one of two members of the titular Mercenary Kings, a group of heroic mercs out to stop the dangerous organization CLAW.\n\nThe graphics, sounds, and gameplay all give that retro feel but retain mechanics not often found in older games. One such system being the crafting system where you can make an almost infinite combination of guns. Want to make a gatling gun that has the range (and possibly accuracy) of a sniper rifle that shoots acidic bullets? You can do just that. The mission difficulty curves rather well and, with over 100 different missions, this is rather impressive.\n\nThe missions themselves all follow rather basic procedures. Enter the map and fulfill objectives. These range from "neutralize" (destroying or capturing a boss target), "eliminate threat" (destroy all enemies within a certain area), "gathering" (find the specified quantity of a specified item), and more. While the objectives are more or less the same, the game manages to throw a few curve balls with special variants, such as bosses guarding target areas or different permutation of enemies in a given area.\n\nWhile this game is a great play by yourself, it's even more fun if you can play with friends. You and up to three friends can take on the evil CLAW! With this, even more possibilities open up. Do you and your friends split up and take on several objectives at once or do you stick together and back each other up? Will you all bring in LMGs and Shotguns in preparation for a lot of close quarters combat or will one of you pack a sniper and pick things off from a distance?\n\nBut not all is great for this game. While it's an amazing game either solo or with friends, playing solo does feel a little punishing. When solo, you may have to do some runs almost perfectly and that requires repeating a single mission several times (which can get dull). But with friends, it won't nearly be as bad, Missions like this, however, are few, and a little practice is always good, no?\n\nIt's definitely worth a look. This game may not be for everyone, but if you like arcade-y games like Metal Slug or Contra, this game is for you.","March 29, 2014","true","55.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To me at least, the system of equipment weighing you down seems out of place, and the Monster Hunter-type layout of missions giving you different objectives in the same areas means it can get kind of repetitive, especially if there's a gun part or something you REALLY want to get the materials for.\n\nTrifles aside, it's a fine example of mashing together run-and-gun violence and strategic weapon crafting.","January 14, 2015","true","26.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
