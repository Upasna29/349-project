Soothing and at a lot of times hilariously unexpected. Then after about an hour the challenge starts to work its way up. You go from making bridges and boxes to golf clubs.  A lot of it is trial and error. Some of it is luck. There is no given way to complete each challenge.\n\nSome of the challenges get good, but not frustrating. In hindsight though this is one of those games that you play.... but don't return to and that's not a good thing for a $20 game. There's nothing compelling me to return. This game is good if you're a creative person or just like drawing with a mouse.","March 13, 2013","true","0.7"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","0"

The ball has a crush on the star. Get them together.\nAlso, forget straight lines. Use your crayons, crazy colors, go outside the lines.\nIf you enjoy structure and knowing the limits of your games, this isn't going to work for you.\nIf you love puzzle games and wish you could get in a quick few stages before nap time, this one's for you.","August 13, 2015","true","0.6"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","15","17","3","0"

The fun comes from experimenting, coming up with different solutions and seeing your contraptions take on a life of their own. It can be hard to draw certain shapes, and sometimes the physics seem to bug out.

But this game is elegant in its simplicity -- get the red ball to the star, and draw with coloured crayons to get it there. The music is pretty relaxing, and in general the game isn't very fast-paced. A great game to play when you're stressed or annoyed.\nThe real fun is when over-the-top solutions work, or when a simple but crude solution works right off the bat.\n\nThat said, the game's physics engine isn't perfect. I've had it freak out a few times while playing, mostly from jamming too many objects in one space. But when it freaks out, it does so in spectacular ways, which is a plus.\n\nOverall, this game is fun and relaxing, but $20 ($22 CDN) isn't worth it. If the game is on sale though, it's worth a buy.","April 4, 2015","true","8.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

The game aspect of it is that there are levels where you need to get a ball to touch the stars in a level.\n\nAs a game, Crayon Physics fails on most levels. It's far too easy, and the same solutions work on most of the puzzles, making it very repetitive. The music and sound is very basic. "Winning" Crayon Physics is as boring as it is pointless.\n\nAs a physics sandbox, it's too basic for my tastes. I'm sure there are cool things you can do, but they would take far too much effort to do with the limited toolbox you're given. (Why can't we make motors? I'd love that. Or at least make the ropes actually work.) Or maybe I'm missing something... the tutorial is amazingly bad.\n\nIf you want to draw cool stuff and watch it go, then sure, pick up Crayon Physics. I'll spend the time playing games instead. Either way, do not spend $20 on this... wait until it's on sale.","August 16, 2011","false","1.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","1"

Each level that I played was quite easy to get the ball from the start to the star. However, I fear the reason I wasn't able to get into this game is that I always went for the simplest and most effective route. If you're one who likes needlessly challenging yourself or finds enjoyment in coming up with zany solutions then Crayon Physics Deluxe is for you.\n\nThe graphics are cute but they too grow boring quickly. The music is pleasant and relaxing but I only noticed two different tracks, a menu and gameplay track. Either it all blends together or there is lots of looping.\n\nI can't help but think this was a relatively easy game to produce that happened to gain some popularity due to its look and the way you draw to interact with the physics puzzles. While that shouldn't necessarily be held against a developer I do think the price of the game should reflect that. At 20$ full price at the time of writing I see this as way overpriced.","June 1, 2014","false","0.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/recommended/26900/","maderschramm","Shotime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/","1157 products in account","Crayon Physics Deluxe is a fun little indie game that, at its basic level, is a physics puzzler. You're goal is to guide a ball towards little stars placed around the play area. To get to the stars you draw various shapes that perform different jobs to move you towards your goal. You can make bridges, hammers, golf clubs, and even create chain devices to move pieces around. Even uniteligable squiggles can have purpose! It's rather fun, but extremely casual, not that there's anything wrong with that. I'd recommend this game for children or for use in an educational setting. If you're looking for a puzzler to kill time with there are many better alternatives on Steam; however, if you have a mobile device or tablet capable of playing this game I would highly recommend you play this game on such a platform. The drawing mechanics seem to be made for touch controls and that's where this casual game with an educational / emphasis on younger players really shines. I could easily see myself sitting down with a toddler and playing this with them on a tablet, and I really believe that's what this game was made for. At least in the beginning - later on the puzzles get pretty hard so if the game mechanics really draw you in you can find additional depth for this game. Unfortunately, I got bored of it after a little while and even though they threw in unique features such as rockets to move objects I didn't see the need to continue. I got the gist of what the author was trying to convey and enjoyed the game for what it was already without having to force myself through puzzles that I found uninteresting. Perhaps I just lacked the imagination to see a solution but towards the end I had no idea what to do. At the start, however, this game is a shining example of teaching the player to play as they play, with handy on-screen instructions and logical puzzles that utilize new mechanics that you've just learned.\n\nPros:\nFun, casual game\nUnique mechanics\nWorks great on a mobile platform\nTeaches the player while you play\nLevel Editor and free Downloadable Player Content adds endless 'fun' if you feel like digging through maps for good releases\n\nCons:\nUses up its gimmick rather quickly\nPerhaps I lack imagination, but some of the harder puzzles didn't give any hints on what to do - it was just a blank screen with a star floating somewhere for example\n\nThis is a nifty little game that's pretty gimmicky but does what it tries to do pretty well. I'd recommend it for a casual gamer or as an educational game, especially on a mobile platform. If you're looking for a serious puzzler I'd look elsewhere (especially on the computer) but if you enjoy the mechanics this game does offer depth if you continue with it.

It's a pretty good trick, actually: draw your own objects in crayon art and watch them interact with realistic physics.\n\nThe puzzles, such as they are, can all be described as "get the circle to the star." You receive bonus accolades for being particularly stylish or traditional in your solution, but these bonuses seem arbitrary.\n\nNone of the puzzles requires more than a few minutes to solve. Some take just a few seconds. A really difficult puzzle might require 15-30 minutes of noodling.\n\nCrayon Physics Deluxe is gentle and entertaining, and you'll need 3-5 hours to solve all of the puzzles here. After that, there is an online community where players create and share their own puzzles, which gives this game some legs, if you care to explore further.\n\nThis is not  a bad game, but it's typical of the indie scene: A neat concept turned into a mildly entertaining game, giving a few hours’ entertainment at a very reasonable price.","August 10, 2011","true",""," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Draw a box in the sky, let it fall onto one side of the ball, and thanks to physics, the ball will be pushed in the opposite direction. Draw a bigger box and it'll be heavier. Or maybe attach a rectangle to a pivot point, and let it swing down to knock the ball like a golf club. And then watch as the ball runs up ramps that you've set up beforehand, or crosses your drawn bridge, or busts through obstacles to reach the goal.\n\nExcept the "Physics" in Crayon Physics don't always work the way you anticipate. And a lot of times, you are setting up weird contraptions in such a limited space that you feel like you are cheating your way to a real solution when it works just slightly differently than the 19 previous tries in the way you wanted. Like other physics-based puzzle games, there is oftentimes just frequent reconstruction of a valid approach because physics decided not to be kind.\n\nCrayon Physics is a fun game, but download the demo first to see how much you'll be fighting the physics engine. When it works, it's pretty fun and makes you feel smart. When it doesn't... well... it just feels cheap. Only recommended if you can get it for relatively cheap.\n\n3 out of 5 foxes.","December 5, 2013","false","4.2"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

The pricipal mechanic (drawing objects that help a ball get from Point A to Point B) is novel at first, but quickly grows repetitive.\n\nYou'd think a game like this would reward creativity, but it's really just a victim of its own flexibility. Instead of coming up with clever or elegant solutions, you're heavily incentivized to draw crude, formless objects that fling or nudge the ball in the right direction until you eventually do something that achieves your goal. The game gets difficult at times, but you never feel like you're being forced to think much; it's just that moving the ball from one place to another is so unwieldy that it's hard to implement a real solution. In fact, I'm pretty sure that even the creator didn't have elgant solutions in mind for some of these puzzles. Every once in a while you'll do something neat that feels rewarding, but it's a very rare occurrence.\n\nWeirdly, the game actually feels like it's a little too long. You're introduced to a couple of new mechanics along the way, but by the end of the game all of the puzzles start to feel the same. There's actually really not much you can do with the engine, so it's not long before the game gets stale. In the end, it doesn't feel much like a physics sandbox at all. I finished the game, but I didn't want to; I'm just a completionist.\n\nIf this game were $5, then yeah it might be worth picking up for a plane ride or to play with your kids. In fact this game probably gets a bit more fun if multiple people are "playing" it together at once, huddled around the screen.

This game is for sure not worth that price. Maybe for $5, if you like physics puzzle games. There's a decent amount of content, but pretty much every solution is "trap ball and then raise with random lines." The physics engine itself is very wonky. Sometimes the ball will get pushed through walls or out of bounds for seemingly no reason. If you're creative or enjoy puzzle games, it is alright but not for $20.

I got the game through the Humble Bundle and I really did not enjoy it. It's a physics based puzzle game in which you draw lines and objects in order to get a ball from point A to point B.\n\nHowever, there is a problem with the scoring system. In order to get more than one star (you can get up to three), you can only draw one object. This means your creativity is limited if you want to obtain the stars you need to unlock the other islands in the game.\n\nPlus, the method of obtaining three stars makes it redundant. In order to obtain three stars for a level, your method of solving it must adhere to the rules of obtaining two stars (only one object and you cannot move the ball manually) and also be classed as an awesome idea. How do you meet that criteria? You set it yourself. That's right. You mark your solution as awesome on your own. So you can get any two star solution, no matter how dull and immediately get a bonus star by ticking a box. Not very rewarding if you ask me.\n\nGood concept, but poorly executed.","January 30, 2014","false","3.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It relies too much on your creativity while lacks in providing something really substancial. I was really looking forward to playing this game, but in the end it was nothing more than a big disappointment. I sympathize so much with this game, but I can't see how I could recommend it. If you can face it more like a sandbox than a puzzle game, maybe you can have some fun with it.\n\nPros:\nCute simplistic graphics\nOkay BGM\nThere's a lot of room for being creative and trying an infinite variety of strategies to solve the puzzles\nCons:\nWhat you draw doesn't always match the objects' hit area, making it kinda clumsy\nTerrible tutorial (of lack thereof) that made me wonder how to create ropes, pins etc.\nDifficulty is either too easy (if you just wanna get beat each stage) or too hard (if you're aiming for the Elegant and Old School solutions)\nTo get the Awesome solution, all you have to do is vote for it as awesome... which is really, really lame\nSome parts of the physics, like friction and the weight of the objects you create, fall short\nTheir official forum is dead\nBought on / for: I traded this game because I like puzzle games and I thought it would be fun. But, c'mon, a full price of US$ 20 (R$ 35 is cheaper, but still really expensive)!? Had I known, I wouldn't get it even with a 90% discount AND if it had trading cards. I can totally see this game being uploaded to a F2P website, like kongregate.\n\nSimilar games: If you're feeling like you wanna solve puzzles while drawing stuff with crayons, by all means, go for Draw a Stickman: EPIC.

Quite frankly I really wished they upped the original creators work than this terrible excuse of an expansion. This is a game best kept short rather than expand in to infinity with boring level design. Crayon Physics Deluxe is very cute, and creative in the first hour of playing, but beyond that it gets really obvious the creator ran out of design ideas for levels and decided to mash random ♥♥♥♥ together to extend the length of the game. The game asks the players to challenge themselves by using different methods to solve levels, there are no achievements for you to do this, there are no leaderboards, and in other words there is no point in trying. If you want a cute drawing game similar in core gameplay to Crayon Physics Deluxe but better, buy Max and the Magic Marker.","August 8, 2012","false","13.2"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

There's a lot of content, the physics work pretty well and are surprisingly consistent with real-world principles, and there are a lot of levels (70+).\n\nActually, you know what? I was about to give this game a "maybe" recommendation (which means, as you may know, that it's not for everyone but if you're a fan of the genre you should go for it), and then I saw the price. Crayon Physics is $20 on Steam. What?! There's not enough complexity or content in this game to justify $20 in my mind. Most damningly, I've played Flash games that do the same things that this game does, only for free. Don't buy it unless the price goes way down, or you grab it in an Indie Bundle.\n\nFull review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2012/01/crayon-physics-deluxe.html","June 19, 2014","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can do this however you want or do it the best possible way imaginable. This is a game that pushes the player to be more creative with each puzzle encountered. It encourages trial and error as there is no given solution shown to complete the puzzles. Some puzzles are challenging but definitely not frustrating in any way.\n\nIt's well worth it if you could get this game at the price of $5 or less.

However, there are many ways to solve the puzzle, using blocks, pins, and all of the simple machines imaginable. Solving a puzzle can be super easy to others requring more thoughtful solutions. The art style uses crayons of course in a unique manner. Some levels are bare but others have decorations that increase the value of crayons and drawings that call of childhood. The music also is a nice touch, adding to the simple design and themes of childhood while not being annoying when trying to solve the physics puzzles. For the art and music, this can recall childhood memories.

The idea was a fresh one: a simple game that offered physics based puzzles with simplistic artwork. One day, shortly after its conception, Crayon Physics was taking a walk through the internets. Somewhere between Newgrounds and ♥♥♥♥♥, Crayon Physics came to a clearing and sat down to take a break. Suddenly out of nowhere, a big group of shady looking ideas came into the clearing from the shadows.\nCrayon Physics took a look around at the newcomers. "Gee, they look a lot like me," he thought to himself "but there's just something not right about them."\n"DURRR!" Said one clone.\n"HURRR!" Shouted another.\nSudenly, hudreds of clones surrounded Crayon Physics and it was lost in a sea of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ clones.\n\nHonestly, I was tired of this game before I started it thanks to the clones of it. Now I just try to solve the puzzles by drawing a ♥♥♥♥♥. I'm somehow shocked at how well this works. Overall, a solid game.","August 1, 2011","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The idea was a fresh one: a simple game that offered physics based puzzles with simplistic artwork. One day, shortly after its conception, Crayon Physics was taking a walk through the internets. Somewhere between Newgrounds and ♥♥♥♥♥, Crayon Physics came to a clearing and sat down to take a break. Suddenly out of nowhere, a big group of shady looking ideas came into the clearing from the shadows.\nCrayon Physics took a look around at the newcomers. "Gee, they look a lot like me," he thought to himself "but there's just something not right about them."\n"DURRR!" Said one clone.\n"HURRR!" Shouted another.\nSudenly, hudreds of clones surrounded Crayon Physics and it was lost in a sea of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ clones.\n\nHonestly, I was tired of this game before I started it thanks to the clones of it. Now I just try to solve the puzzles by drawing a ♥♥♥♥♥. I'm somehow shocked at how well this works. Overall, a solid game.","August 1, 2011","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Curiously, while every puzzle can be solved in a myriad of different ways, any given solution tends to also be applicable to many different puzzles, and so I felt there was a shortage of those moments of enlightenment that make the puzzle genre particularly rewarding.","August 11, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style is fantastic and brings you right back to your childhood. The earlier puzzles are fun and simple to solve. The later puzzles, however, can be frustrating. I feel like the creators should have done more to introduce the player to what they can do in Crayon Physics. They should have introduced the player to more skills that they can use, combine, and manipulate as they progress through the game. Some levels can be solved just about any way you want but others seem like they have a very specific way of being solved. Others almost seem like they were not play tested. Without having more structured rules on what you can and can't do in Crayon Physics, many of the puzzles are solved with repeated solutions, drawing jumbles of random shapes, or just blind luck. I solved many puzzles just by drawing circles or squiggles beneath the ball until it reached the goal (or caused the game to crash).\n\nAnother low point was the music. With such a simple and colorful game, I would expect instrumental renditions of the Sesame Street theme to serve as the soundtrack. Instead, the soundtrack is made up of somber, ambient music that makes you feel sad and sleepy instead of youthful, energized, and inspired.\n\nCrayon Physics Deluxe was a great idea but the execution just falls short. Pick it up only if you're really into physics-based puzzle games. But only buy it if it's on sale. It can be fun at times but not $20 of fun.","May 22, 2015","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Helpful when going for Elegant / Old School solutions\n\nCons\n- The ability to mark solutions as Awesome is good, but forcing people to do it to earn the star is stupid.\n- The physics don't always make much sense. Even after playing for hours I'm often surprised by how an object reacts. It will have more/less mass than I expect.\n- I wish there was some way to Undo things. It's annoying to have to redraw/redo several things after you mess up drawing a single thing.\n-- The game sometimes has trouble distinguishing between when you want to draw a pin vs. a small object.\n- Too many puzzles have essentially the same solution.\n- Game fails to launch on a retina MacBook Pro if you've set your system resolution to 1920x1200.
