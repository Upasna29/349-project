If you long for the dark labyrinths of Hexen you'll feel at home here. Wickland is strictly oriented around competitive multiplayer dueling in the spirit of Quake; no single player campaign to be found here, although there may be bots eventually. The weapons are a crazy mix of unreal and quake, with an alternate fire mode for some interesting combos, but retaining the fundamental balance and simplicity of the quake arsenal. The game runs very nicely in the unreal engine, and they've incorporated a wall-jump movement mechanic that feels simple and unique compared to the manic bunnyhopping of some other games. The result is there's less tricks to learn and you can jump right into the dueling metagame, which is where Wickland really shines.\n\nThey've put a twist on the classic duel ruleset, where players fight for control of armor and health; in Wickland each weapon is its own monster with armor and doesn't respawn on the map until it is "killed" off your opponent. The winner is not the person with the most kills, but simply who manages to frag the base human character first. It's amazing how fresh this mechanic feels, and also how much more accesible it makes AFPS dueling which is notorious for its difficulty. Perhaps the best part about it is if you are hopelessly outmatched by your opponent, the game will simply end and you wont have to sit through the 10-15 minutes of humiliation that turn so many off to dueling.\n\nAlthough they have borrowed elements from other shooters, Mad Ram cite real life duelling sports like Kendo as their inspiration. Players expecting over the top free for all combat may be dissapointed. Also, there are only three maps right now, which is a good thing since you'll need to know them inside out. Wickland is as close as you can get to a pure distilation of duel culture--where reflexes are only a means of executing a sophisticated mental game, and the ethos is relentless self-improvement. Whether it's chess or martial arts or Quake, if you enjoy the intensity of competitive one-on-one sports, Wickland is for you.","November 14, 2014","true","1.4"," 86 of 112 people (77%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","77","86","112","7","0"

Most medieval games have slow movement, melee combat and shields, but not in Wickland. In this game, you have a machine gun like crossbows, rapid fire magic spells and quick thrown bombs. Every player moves super fast, has a lot of mobility and a decent jump. The big twist here is the fact that you don't collect weapons, you collect monsters that have their own abilities. So another weapon is one of seven monsters each with their own ammunition and health. Monster health is like armor. If the monster loses all its health, you lose that monster and need to get it again. When you're taking damage as a monster, you're also losing your overall health. If you lose all your overall health, you're dead even if you're a monster. It keeps things interesting and the monster skins are a good way to tell who is using what weapon. Although the action is so fast it turns into shoot whatever is moving. As a human crusader, you can pick up armor for extra resilience against attacks. If you are a monster when you pick up armor, that monster gets extra health, but your overall player health stays the same. Its all a nice system.\n\nThe monsters feel like they're from black and white cinema classics. You've got a werewolf with quick bombs that will bounce around before it explodes. Players caught in the explosion will fly through the air a bit. A gorilla (mini king kong?) with an arm cannon and the alternate fire is a double blast. A blue creature from the black lagoon with a long electric laser blast and a blue floating orb alternate fire. A yellow kracken that slowly fires a beam from its claw and spits acid that ricochets off the walls. A green lizard that has invisibility when you hold down the primary weapon and a strong claw melee for an alternate. Even when invisible, I could never catch up to anyone because everyone moves so fast. A goat beast that throws flaming red skulls that I can only think of the barons from Doom. Finally there is a bat that quick fires green glowing orbs and the alternate fire is a spread shot of the orbs. They all have the same movement speed, so there's nothing special about them other than their weapon.\n\nCurrently, the game has six maps, each has its own unique theme and some good action. Each passageway on every map is nice and wide. You'll always be able to run by other players or joust with them. Most maps have an upper and lower floor with most of the action happening on the lower one. There are plenty of balconies to fire down from and staircases to get up there. The maps aren't too big, so you'll always find action. There are bottlenecks, and wide open spaces to jump over gaps and have good fire fights. The game also makes use of jump plates that shoot you from the floor to the ceiling pretty easy. You'll even find paintings that act like portals for you to pass through. Each portal shows what's on the other side even if its a distorted ripple. There is slight fall damage, but only from the highest possible peaks I could find.\n\nYou'll discover armor, power ups and health of every shape and size. These items are everywhere. Health adds to your overall player health. The monster heads are on pedestals and the ammunition for the monsters is strewn about. You're never truly out of ammunition, if you run out of one type, just switch off, but keep in mind your monster's health. Would you rather use a healthy monster with no ammo or one that's about to die with plenty of ammo? Some power ups give you health or armor which exceeds your maximum and then it slowly drains down. Its a good way to keep players aggressive and hungry. These items are all commonplace in a first person shooter and it all feels familiar.\n\nThe game looks great all for a small file size under 1 GB. Closer scrutiny might find low quality textures, but for the most part the aesthetic is beautiful. Everything has a wonderful glow to it that adds to things. All the projectiles look different. Blue electricity, flaming red skulls, yellow acid spit and so on. Its another deeper way to let you know who has what weapon. It turns into a subtle rainbow of chaos on the battle field. Since killing something is so difficult, there is a satisfying giant red explosion of blood to let you know you've finally done it.\n\nSo why don't I recommend it? First of all, the game feels like I've played it before. It feels like other UDK (Unreal) engine shooters. So it feels familiar, just with a beautiful new theme. The biggest glaring issue is that its a multi player game with no players. At the peak I've found nine players at the most, but this is a few months after the game's release. Sure there could be a cheap sale and the game can find itself packed to the gills with players, but for how long? There are maybe ten dedicated servers across the globe. A few in Europe, one in Asia, another in Australia, South America and a few in the United States. From what I've seen, it seems like the European servers are the busiest. My ping was over one hundred, so while it was manageable, its not as good as the few servers in the US with even fewer people playing.\n\nSince the lack of bodies is an issue, Wickland does include a practice mode. Its essentially a single player offline mode where you compete against bots. When you start practice, you need to then pause the game and push the "add bot" button to dump them into the game. So you can have one on one or all out mayhem with as many bots as you can add. Maybe even a gold collecting to see who has the most at the end of the round. Any extra modes would only fragment what little player base there is.\n\nWhat about the modes? These games need to have a robust amount of modes right? Its all just a timed death match. At the end of the time limit you see the score. You can also see the score board before then with the press of a key. There just isn't a good amount of modes to keep me interested. I'd like team death match, king of the hill, even capture the flag, but I guess for a medieval spin it would be capture the torch. After playing fast twitchy first person shooters for twenty years, this one felt like a change in theme, but nothing else. I'd love to be able to make my own server instead of using the dedicated ones. Its still great that the game has dedicated servers.\n\nFor those that care, there is a wide array of settings. Rebindable keys, different resolutions and advanced graphical settings. There is even mouse sensitivity up to 100 and field of view up to 150 if you like. The game performs excellently, and I think it could perform well even on older systems. One thing I would prefer is being able to visit the settings menu while in game. If not in multi player then in practice mode.\n\nThere is a lot of potential here, but I'm just not sure the world is ready for a new old school online multi player FPS. There's nothing wrong with it, I just didn't feel like there was enough to keep me invested. It needs more modes, more players and more fun. Even if the game says its in beta (but not Early Access), I'm not sure it will ever get in the modes or player base to keep it going or even get it started.","February 13, 2015","false","5.1"," 98 of 135 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","98","135","5","8"

If the health gets to zero, the beast is "defeated" and disappears (or dies, not sure, you see a strange reddish fountain, I don't know what to make of it.. ).\n\nIf you lose a beast, you'll be instantly switched to another beast you have picked up before.\nIf all beasts are gone, only the mere mortal remains.

You transformed into monsters to kill your opponents in an Arena FPS fashion and the theme was great, even though most of the music and sound were royalty free which you can find online.\n\nBut unfortunately, the developers were aiming solely to become some giant eSport and were so worried of, I quote "being like any other arena FPS" that they never listened to their community - except for literally like 2-4 people who moaned about any change that came with a patch, and would get reverted instantly, effectively making some patches a waste of bandwidth. There was only one game mode, which was a duel where whoever dies first loses but you could also play in the "warmup" lobby, where it's just DM with no score limit and a 10 minute time limit which you could not change.\n\nTo make it worse, the master server for this game went down within weeks after launch and the developers still haven't done anything about it, and this was released November of 2014. The servers have literally been down for over a year. When the servers were up, you could only host a dedicated server by emailing your info to the developers to allow your server to even be seen on their master server and you couldn't create a listen or LAN server.\n\nIt isn't like the developers are too busy with their lives/not on steam much or anything because the game isn't going on sale all the time all by itself and their Steam account shows that they've been playing other games. Either way it's bad practice. They're blatantly ignoring their forums, not even letting people know if they're really done with the game or not but obviously they are. There's literally no point in buying this game because you can't even play it, unless you consider having bots that literally don't miss a single shot even if just a pixel of you is visible as playing. Oh well, I had fun exploiting console commands to spawn Unreal Tournament 3 guns and powerups in online servers while it lasted.

While you're free to participate in Free-For-All/Deathmatch games in warm-up, Duel is the real meat of the game. For an Early Access title, the game plays and feels complete based on the features it advertises, both graphically and mechanically.\n\nIf you're on the fence because gameplay looks fast, don't be afraid - mechanical movement complexity is kept to a minimum compared to games like Quake and Unreal Tournament (you get WASD, jump, and a simple wall-jump that's easy to perform; that's it). This is so that you can focus on item control and timing straight away, which are two of the foundations of Duel; grab and hold onto as much of the map's pick-ups and beasts as possible, while denying your opponent the same.\n\nSpeaking of beasts, they replace the role of weapons. Upon first glance, they seem to be simply re-skins of weapons that have functional equivalents in other arena shooters, but you'll soon notice that each beast has its own armor value, and these beasts can soak up a major portion of incoming damage. In Duel, beasts do not respawn until they die, which makes armor pick-ups an important element to control, since your weaponry also have a lifeline of their own. It's this tug-of-war of attempting to relinquish your opponent's control of their beasts while keeping up your own item timings that makes Duel exciting and tense. Map sizes are also just right; many veteran arena shooter fans may find the maps a bit claustrophobic, but they are kept small enough so that it's easy to remember where most pick-ups and beasts are located after running through them a few times.\n\nIf you've ever entertained the idea of playing Duel in an arena shooter, give Wickland a chance. It's unique take on Duel makes for some very fun experiences, and I like it for being an accessible arena shooter that also doesn't hesitate to punish you for your mistakes. Highly recommended.","November 17, 2014","true","21.5"," 30 of 39 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","30","39","0","5"

It has a lot of neat ideas but isn't far enough along to be worthwhile yet. It's a strong start and has got potential, but I'm worried it might never fulfil that potential.\n\nThe big problem is, right now, Wickland doesn't really do anything better than classic UT. In a few months, with more development, it might. But it also doesn't have the community required to be playable, so without the bots (promised in an upcoming version) it's literally not possible to play this.\n\nEven with a friend to join in, it's got some issues. The game's focus seems to be on 1V1 duels, which makes the sprawling combat arenas a strange choice. I feel like it might have benefitted more from something closer, where it was less easy to lose sight of your opponent.\n\nOverall, keep an ear out. If you start hearing great things about this in the future, go for it. But I wouldn't buy this yet, even if you get one for a friend.\n\nEdit: The game now features bots, which can provide quite a bit of challenge. There are two new maps as well, but the online community remains very small.

Speaking of creatures, in the game you pick up a 'creature' head where you gain the ability to transform into it and use it's unique abilities, and you can stack those creatures and always have them with you, and to translate those abilities, you got your sniper creature, melee, full auto 'human' shooter, SMG-er..etc.\n\nI like the graphic style with a dark medievil kind of feel to it with all of it's mythical creatures like a werewolf, a land-fish human thing, a vampire (the good ones), a crazy monkey..etc. Didn't hear any music in the game, but god do i want to hear more of it after look at the game's trailer.\n\nI'll have to speak honest on this game, and in general for games like it, and since it's still in development might as well use this opportunity to give my feedback. The game doesn't have many players in it, and if it's in the state that it is now when it launches, it won't have any players after a week to a months time after release, same thing happened with another game called Rise Of The Triad, where the game's MP died in about a months to two's time, only a group of people keeping it alive only one day a week. So what I'm going to say, in the game's current state, is that if you have a friend or more to play with, and if you like old school twitch shooters, then go get it and have fun, if not, going in this solo, even with the tempting low price, don't get it.\n\nHere's my one feedback i can provide that will make me recommend this game to both types of people i.e anyone, and this one solution is for all these types of fun games that go down, and that solution is.. add bots. That's it, and i don't know how hard it is to add bots/AI in the game, but that's the solution i find that's needed.\n\nOther feedback i can provide is, add LAN matches, music in matches, numbering the characters/weapons you collect on the keyboard instead of just scrolling, explain and have a tutorial for the confusing score system, and what each character does (which adding a dummy to shoot at helps). That's all i can think of add the moment, and I'm probably nailing the game now, but i do honestly like it and that's why I'm saying all this, and i hope these notes are taken into considerations for, in my opinion, improving the game dramatically.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEBkhquc-g&list=UU-bYm-N2k6pVVh1YQHCsCqA\n\nUPDATE: So I haven't tried it yet, but now there's bots in the game, so in my eyes, it's an safe purchase =)\n\nShalmess link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.","November 14, 2014","true","0.4"," 28 of 42 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","28","42","0","0"

I finished in third place in the latest tournament of Wickland too.\n\nBuy Wickland, you will find the best and competitive duel mode 1v1 ever made in an FPS arena. If you want to play or want to learn something on the game add me...\nHowever there are 7 beasts in the game plus the human (your main character), when the duel begins you have to pick the beast spawned in the map, every beast has its armour and can die, but you main character (the human again) will not die, you will lose only that beast you picked and it will respawn again in the spawn, yeah because if someone pick a beast it doesn't spawn until the beast is killed (this happens only in the duel mode in the Free for all it doesn't happen). Every beast has its own primary and secondary fires. So you must combine fires of beasts that you picked in the beginning to do a lot of damage to your opponent. More beasts you have, much possibilites of winning the duel you have. When you will kill a beast of your opponent, you must go to the spawn of that beast to pick it to gain advantage on your opponent. There a lot of things too, buy it to find it.\nReally I hope you will buy the game because it's great.","January 18, 2015","true","92.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Wickland has so much depth to it and is so satisfying to play like no other Arena FPS I know. Be aware though that it requires more than aim, movement and killer instinct.

Take your time for reading the basic gameplay overview, make yourself familiar with the maps, weapons and movement in ffa and duel-practice. Don't expect to master this game within a few hours.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ique/recommended/321260/","ique","ique","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ique/","388 products in account","Wickland is a fast paced and brutal 1v1 arena shooter set in a world of magic, sorcery, and in my case especially, much death. Some aspects are immidiately familiar to anyone that has played an arena shooter, but Wickland quickly sets itself apart. You have one life and you will no doubt have to hold on to it dearly. Your weapons are not merely handheld devices of destruction but transform yourself into beasts of various kinds, and picking one up denies your enemy of it as well. This leads to some very suspenseful fights over resources, and it's really quite deep and unique.\n\nBut as great as the dueling is, it's a bit of a shame there aren't any other game modes, other than a FFA-like warmup mode. It feels like even just some simple TDM could do well and be very interesting with the game mechanics. Duelling can be mentally exhausting and sometimes you want to play something more relaxing where you can blame your team mates for your shortcomings.\n\nBrilliant sound and visuals. Shame about the menus and options being perhaps a little too simplistic.\n\nI highly recommend this game, but it might not be everyone's cup of tea. But if all else fails, you can just marvel at the fact you can play as a gorilla with shotgun arms.","February 10, 2015","true","5.4"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Playing with bots, it doesn't feel great -- you'd be much better served by QuakeLive or Unreal Tournament if you're looking for an arena shooter. The weapons are creatures that you transform into, and the health of the weapons/creatures doubles as your armour. But the weapon feel just isn't there. It doesn't have the craziness of UT's weapon selection, and certainly not the "every weapon has a situational use" of Quake III's weapons. That said, as you can see from my playtime, I didn't go in depth. That leads me onto my next point.\n\nI went into 'multiplayer', and there were four 16 person servers running. Two US, one EU, and one SA (this one had a few players, the rest were empty). I'm in New Zealand, and without an AU server, this game may as well be unplayable to me. In addition, it doesn't seem like there's a way to start a server by hand, or at least there's no UI for it.\n\nEven at a low price, I can't recommend Wickland.","June 17, 2015","false","0.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The maps are very good, so tiny but playable in 10-12 players. The engine which move this game is the Unreal Engine 3.9. The graphics are amazing, very good texture detail and lightning, very optimized game not too heavy. The only thing i don't like is the few players on the server.

There are 2 modes at the moment including what they call "Warm up" which is basically just FFA Deathmatch and Duel Mode which is a basic 1v1. Both are fun to play but I find FFA a lot more fast paced and fun.  Weapons are very similar to those of Quake and even imitate them in a midievil way. Instead of keeping the same character through the game though, you switch between them on the go by simply scrolling or pressing a number key, each character having a different weapon. Health pickups, Ammo, Armor and Weapons spawn around the map and must be walked over to be collected all respawning a short time later. Graphics are pretty nice and the game runs great from what I have played giving me a solid 130 FPS without drops on an Nvidia 650ti.\nNow being that it's an Early Access game that runs so great, we have to ask ourselves.. What is there left to add to this game? Well it is almost in it's final stage of development except for a few minor things, those including Bot support for singleplayer fragging, Clan support and additional maps.\nThe only problem that I have with the game at the moment is that the servers are quite empty most the time due to the game being new and in early stages of development, but I'm sure that will change as time passes. Alternatively there are Steam groups and Facebook communities that organize playing times, so finding a game with people only takes joining a group and meeting some people. I've managed to get a few games in with people and had a great time playing. The most I have gotten to experience was 7 players in FFA and the fast pace shooting and jumping makes for the best 10 minutes of bloodshed and mayhem I've experienced in a while.\nThe developers, who are very active in the forums, are also organizing tournaments with a few gaming leagues like ESL for players to win prizes. So there will definitely be a larger player base in the future. If you're into oldschool FPS games, this is definitely one you're gonna want to look into.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QokT3CEg5VA","November 24, 2014","true","2.2"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

The game itself has a great fast paced gameplay but it lacks some things like more maps, more game modes and the weapons/monsters from my point of view are to few. The maps could be more dynamic, or at least the game should support modding. I liked it but it lacks some things, so the only way i'm recommending to buy this is if you find a steam offer that reduces the game above 50% of it's original price.

The twist is that instead of being able to select from different weapon varieties, you get to select from (so far) eight different monster characters, each one specializing in their own weapon varieties and style of play. The player selects and changes between them using the scroll up and down mouse wheel just like you would with weapon selection. As it stands right now, you start each match as a Crusader knight with a rapid fire machine gun-like cross bow, and quickly collect icons that allow you to transform into a King Kong ape looking monster, Creature from the black lagoon fish monster, Nosferatu vampire character, some crab looking creature, a wolf man, ect. ect. It's great and so much fun. The big problem for me is that there isn't a large player community right now. It's a shame because it's such a hidden gem. This game definitely needs more publicity. Hopefully the addition of bots and more maps when it happens will stimulate and grow the player community. Great job developers and programmers.

There's really no way to explain how wonderful this game is. There is no other game that is this extraordinary, despite all of the bad ratings. in this game, you can morph into 8 different animals, starting with the human, then a lizard, then a gorilla, then a werewolf, then a demon, then a frog, then a fish, and finally, a blue          ogre-esque thing. these different classes shoot different things. The easiest class (in my opinion) is either the human or frog. The human has a fully automatic crossbow with low damage and mediocre accuracy, and the frog shoots slow-fired, high precision, high damage green slimeball things.\n\nnow time for some pros and cons:\n\npros:\n\n-you can switch between the classes at any time, pressing the keys 1-8\n-there is a practice mode where you can play against as many bots as you want (literally, you could play with WAY more than 100 bots on a tiny map)\n\n-there is a VERY small learning curve\n-it's one of those games that's easy to learn, but hard to master\n- you can choose between third & first person\n-when one character dies, the other is used. You only die when all the characters you have unlocked are dead.\n\ncons:\n\n-awkward FOV\n-really fast movement (this can be good or bad)\n-you lose health slowly over time(can be good or bad)\n\nand that's the end of this review of wickland.

It gave me that old school fps feel. Gameplay is fast and requires some getting use to. If you ever played any of the older Unreal Tournament or Quake games, then you'll feel home here.\n\nThe pickups that you get in here that transforms you into monsters are your guns, which is pretty interesting. Each transformation or whatever you want to call it have different functions. In other words the transformations are your sniper, shotgun, beam gun, etc.\n\nAlthough there is only one map when I last played and a fairly low player population, it was still a fun experience. Hopefully when more content is released and more people are able to play it, then it will be a pretty decent game for veterans and newcomers. Currently there is only one mode I think which is Deathmatch, just wanted to put that out there.","December 11, 2014","true","0.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Its main issue is that even a well made 90s arena shooter like 'Wickland' can't pull gamers away and hold them. Especially gamers that would naturally gravitate towards 'Quake live' or  unreal tournament, next to these the content just isn't there nor the playerbase. I'm unaware of any new low but healthy playerbase arena shooter on steam except 'Reflex' maybe? Granted apart from dabbling a little now and again in the genre, it's clearly something I don't play alot off. Playerbases also in Arena shooters especially low playerbases aren't the easiest on new comers. Good twitch reflexes and god like aiming, from the demigods within the population can alienate most of us motals. Anyway back to Wickland.\n\nWhat I am glad to see is that Bots are included, its what most MP games should be including! If you are buying Wickland I recommend you pick up a few copies and gift them. Great fun to be had against friends, which should last, as long as a classic 90s style arena shooter holds interest to you or your friends. To boot it is on sale a good few times at a heavy discount. It scrapes a recommend from me, its back to a simpler time before complex FPS took over. Just remember there is next to no playerbase.\n\nA cautionary 90% off recommend.","January 12","true","1.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

As of the moment of writing this, I  am unable to play due to the lack of players (0 to be exact (at least 0 every time I log on)).

And overall the game leaves impression of playing Ricoshet™ in UT levels, so nothing as "classic arena FPS".\n\nControl in Menu seems like it does not fully support controls from keyboard and you can't change the settings during the match, even mouse sensitivity. I'd understand that it's an indie project and the devs did care more about to present the idea of "long" battles in classic arena FPS then making the game more comfortable to play, but the game is not free and why they could not imply at least changing settings during the game? That's weird.\n\nThe descriptions says that the " is an indie arena shooter heavily inspired by classic FPS games of the 90's". If it was released back in 90's or begin of 00's, game press would rate this game as a low-tier FPS game.\n\nP.S. I've obtained the game for free from a gift. Thanks to Slowpegasus. Will keep this game installed on my PC until I farmed all trade cards from it.","April 1, 2015","false","1.7"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","13","25","0","1"

Sad to say, doubt I'll be playing it too much, if at all for awhile. It's not that it's a bad game, it has an interesting premise, and could likely provide quite a bit of fun, but sadly it has no active player base at this time. It does at least have a training mode where you can play bots, just be warned at the time of this review, they are insanely hard. On average I seem to get about 1 kill for every 3 or 4 deaths. Will revisit this game in the future, but for now this review is more of a cautionary stance if you don't have a lot of friends to game with. If you and a bunch of friends can all buy the game and play together, you'd likely have a blast.","February 19, 2015","false","1.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","3"

The key spin that this game has on the formula is that instead of picking up weapons, you pick up entire characters that you can switch back and forth between, each having their own weapon. While that may sound confusing, it works extremely well and anyone used to Quake or Unreal Tournament will have no problems at all getting used to Wickland. Each weapon has an alt-fire and they mostly feel pretty unique (although there are a couple takes on old classics), giving Wickland it's own pace and feel. The map design is gorgeous and makes good use of the unreal engine and the controls (especially aiming) are rock solid, which is crucial for a fast paced, skill-based FPS. The playerbase isn't huge, but there are enough people playing to have a good time, and if the amount of people playing ever does dwindle too low, the game is cheap enough that you can get copies for your friends and play it amongst yourselves. The only downside is that you can't host your own servers, which unfortunately seems like it isn't in the cards right now due to the resources available to the developers, but I've had no problems with lag or anything like that (I'm from the US and had no issues playing on an EU server). Right now the game is on sale for 99 cents, which I would say is a steal for such a nicely constructed package.","April 26, 2015","true","1.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's not one of those cheap 99 cent games you usually get from key giveaways. It's a great game, well worth the money if you enjoy the genre(and if you can actually find people to play with). It's one of those fast paced arena shooters where you run around really fast and try to get the highest score before the time runs out. It reminds me of playing Quake 3 on the school network but with a lot better graphics and a cool class-like system. Basically, there are different items around that you pickup. In Quake there were potions, armor, guns, ammo, all of these are self explanitory. The unique thing about Wickland is that rather than guns to pickup, you have monster souls. There are multiple different souls available, each with it's own unique abilities. You can carry multiple different monster souls at once, and can easily switch between them with the scroll wheel. The soul transforms you into a monster that has both a weak left click ability, and a strong right click ability. When you get hit enough, you will lose the soul of your current monster, and once you lose all your souls, you're dead. Respawn time is very short though because this is a fast paced game. I want to play this game more, but the bad thing about it is that there's never a single player online. Lot's of people giving Wickland bad reviews because of the nearly nonexistant amount of players has probably kept people away from buying it.\npssssstt....... hmu on steam if you wanna play","January 16, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I heartily recommend this game if you can find some people to play with!! One of the most unique weapon systems I've ever encountered! You don't pick up "guns" you pick up powerups that are like animals, so when you change weapons you actually change your whole body and become a different monster in a paper-rock-scissors style some-are-better-than-others-for-different-things. You can morph from a crab monster to a werewolf!  Sounds really different right?

It's just... the world's moved on and sad or not, a mp game where you don't have rpg type advancement feels shallow and pointless.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rhyleymaster/recommended/321260/","rhyleymaster","Rhyleymaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rhyleymaster/","273 products in account","This game is amazing. It has the looks and feel of the original quake game, and is a hell of a lot better than that quake live ♥♥♥♥. The very first thing I did when I got in a game was start bhopping, and it felt exactly the same as it used too. The weapons feel like quake and unreal and a ♥♥♥♥ed up child, and its great. This is going to be replacing CS:GO for me, assuming more people play it.\n\nEDIT: There is a major flaw to this game: There is no 'real' P2P multiplayer (Player 2 Player). This means don't expect to have the freedom of creating a server to play with your friends. The game is entirely locked to a few servers. The reason for this is that the devs can't be bothered to add a few settings for servers, so instead of having to connect to one server for everything (duels, warmup, lobby), they could do something that many other games do, which is have all as a seperate setting. For example, what could be done is add duels as a in-menu thing, and then the duel can be hosted between the two players, rather than having both players connect to the same server. Then likewise, they can add a simple server file that only needs to start 1 instance of the server, and not 10 (or so the dev says 10.), which allows players to find and start p2p 16 player FFA matches easier.\n\nI changed my recommendation to a negative for this very reason. I feel that is a game is entirely multiplayer, this should be the very first thing that gets done. Now, I have posted threads on the forums in an attempt to see if the devs would  change from this console-like method, but they seem adamant to keep their decision claiming UDK3 dosen't allow it (Which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I've used UDK3 before and it does). The dev then goes to claim that in order for them to do this, they would need a commerical license, which is also not true. Adding on to this, don't expect to be able to find any multiplayer server  with a good ping, since the ones that are hosted always, are complete ♥♥♥♥. The lack of players is for these reasons, and without players the game can't be played. So unless the devs change this multiplayer P2P method, I can't recommend this game.","April 24, 2015","false","3.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

Players have lots of health so it's not just death after death and it takes some skill.\nMain "weapons" involve: Auto-Crossbow, "rockets", "shotgun", "melee weapon", "grenades", "lightning gun", "sniper rifle", "fully auto rifle"; All in the form of magical powers.\nI'd like to see more game modes in the future like TDM and King of the Hill.","April 25, 2015","true","2.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Cheers!\n\nI have been actively following Wickland's development since purchasing it in August of 2014. Initially, I was impressed with the game play and atmosphere, but the lack of players in this classic-style arena FPS (combined with a lack of single-player mode) meant that there really wasn't a game to play. Thankfully, the developers have been working hard to remedy that situation and, with the addition of bots, I can now confidently and enthusiastically change my rating to "Recommended!"\n\nWickland's new bots are very well designed and thoughtfully implemented. The "Explore" option that previously let the player wander around their map of choice (without playing) still exists, but has been renamed "Practice." Selecting this option still allows the player to explore, but pressing [ESC] lets you add bots one at a time , up to 64 bots (!). Joining an actual game, even if there is nobody else playing, will automatically add three bots to your map, making Wickland, finally, the game it should have been from the start - a "multiplayer" experience whether others are playing or not.  In another nice touch, as new players join the game, they each will replace a bot, meaning there will always be at least three other competitors (and more if more players join).\n\nAs for the bots themselves: there is no gradient learning curve here; they are all pretty much the same in terms of difficulty (which I'd place at a 6 or 7 out of 10) and style (which is basically to jump back and forth in front of the player, although they will occasionally retreat while firing at you).  In another nice touch, bots will attack each other, although it appears that they will always choose you over another bot if you're in their line of "sight." If you consider yourself to be not that great of a player, the bots should increase your skills quite a bit.\n\nWickland's four included maps (as of this writing)  are tight, fun to play, and (hopefully) a sign of other things to come.  The idea of changing players into different creatures is pretty original and should be a draw for fans of arena FPS games. While it is still a beta game, what's here is done very well, and I appreciate the already pretty robust graphics option screen (I'm playing on a three-year old bigbox computer, and matches run smoothly). The controls are responsive and accurate, and I experienced no lag.\n\nNow to address complaints of Wickland having a "dumb score system" and "bad target system": Wickland is based on 1990's arena shooters (and is particularly reminiscent of Quake 3 and UT). That means a kill is worth a point, and it's all about wearing down a player's hit points. This makes game play less tactical and strategic, but more fast paced and frantic. If you're looking for another Arma game, pass this by. However, if you're looking for something fast and furious, Wickland is the game; there is nothing out there like it at the moment (and that includes Quake Live).\n\nI have been waiting for half a year to write this next sentence, and I happily write it now with a massive grin on my face: Wickland is a blast to play, and a must-buy for fans of the genre.","November 19, 2014","true","7.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","5"

While running around the map, you can pick up ammo or powerups that allow you to shapeshift on the spot.  Each of the characters you shapeshift into has their own style of weapon, and a seperate ammo pool. These characters have a variety of play styles, such as the melee assassin and a spell throwing mage.\n\nThe game can be really fun if you have a bunch of friends to play with.

The game is pretty much a reskin with the unique feature being that everyone transforms into monters and what not. each weapon is actually a differnt form of beast you can play. dont take this the wrong way though, each "class" ddoesnt actually do anything different except their weapon but thats totally fine with me, it keeps the game simple. given that its a simple game, it makes it easy to pick up and play and belive it or not, an indie game thats multiplayer only has actual good bots that are perfect for lontg car trips. why long car trips? the game ddoesnt suck the ♥♥♥♥ out of your battery, instead it sips it at a rate of what a normal person would drink water, not drown themselves like other game (im looking at you Battlefied). The game is optimized to run on even the most vegitable potatoes of all PC's.\n\n\nThe issue people have and also the issue i have is that thier isnt many servers and they are always empty. I dont even know why, this is a brillent game but then again, quake live and TF2 are there with a constant community so why play this..... NO MICROTRANSACTIONS!\n\nsetting up LAN is a total ♥♥♥♥♥ but its not hard, once done i was able to play with freinds pretty easily and it was great. Along with that, no one had an issue with the game being at a solid 60 FPS!!! all the time perfect, no stutter in any part of the game (im looking at you CSGO).\n\n10/10 would shott eyeballs across rooms again,","April 18, 2015","true","1.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

So with all the 'creditibility' I earn from that - I hope I have hurt devs enough and drive away people who might now go play fistful of frags or something else actually good. Post comment here if you are offended bro.\n\nOriginal review:\nAnother example of 'do-you-even-oldschool-bro':\nArena FPS with gimmick - your weapons change your look and act as your armor.\nIt has walljump. That's the definition of oldschool. Yeah!\n6 maps. Each of them looks awful. Each of them is too big for 1on1 duel.\nThere is no modding support by the way. No workshop, no SDK, nothing, go away please you pesky modder.\nLAN through console (server through command-line). I don't think anyone would be interested in playing this thing on LAN but still... very user-friendly.\nActually even menu is barebones. Devs ain't put much effort into this thing, I don't know why to build anything at all if you care that 'much' of your game. For example controls configuration menu uses only like 1/16 part of screen.\nYeah, it's cheap. It even was free with some promotion. It's of decent quality for it's 'free' price I give it that. You may even have 5-10 minutes of fun if your friends have this crap too.\nJust don't pay for it - you'll feel robbed.\nStill it's not like anyone would be interested in this pathetic attempt even if it was free. There is s**tton of better arena FPS games. Even free ones. Hell with it, there is ton of better mods with a lot better designed maps.\nNo one plays it and neither should you.\nYou can shoot some bots tho\n\np.s.: Why does it called Wickland?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yurupari/recommended/321260/","yurupari","yuru","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yurupari/","1608 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game pretty much tries to copy the quake 3 arena experience. It offers very fast movement, jumppads, a somewhat crappy walljump (you have to completely face the wall to jump off it), a variety of ~7 guns/armors including rocket and grenade launcher, machinegun, plasma gun, shotgun, sniper, a cloakable melee creature, diverse health, ammo, armor pickups and only 3 maps so far.\n\nIt feels pretty good to play BUT the combined weapon/armor gimmick comes with a lot of downsides... Elaboration: Guns in this game are creatures, but those guns are also your armor, but you can also pick up armor, that will increase the gun given armor. If you get shot enough to get down to 0 creature gun armor, the enemy will earn a point and you will lose that gun. Given that, you can just switch guns to prevent dropping to 0. You can also just run over already picked up guns to reset the gun/armor back to 100.\n\nYour player, lets say the shell of collected creature gun armors, also has a certain amount of health points, wich will result in a bloody mess, a point for the enemy and the loss of all contained guns if lowered to 0.\n\nClearly the developer tried to bring fresh air into the old but gold arena shooter formula, but this doesn't feel right for now.

Because I dont even think I killed someone though I was top fragging all the time.\n\nSo far this game has like....a couple of maps for one deathmatch mode, so there really isnt any gameplay variety.\nThe Character models aside from the Lizard and the Knight are probably the worst things Ive ever seen and they're all voiced by the same person doing....something well thats for sure...\nJust-\nJust keep your hands off of this...its safer that way, like, you really dont want to play this.

I have nothing against fast paced gameplay, but lightspeed is a wee bit much. The monsters/weapons lack a feeling of any real power, and the health system is a bit confusing.

I saw a dev post saying they considered their bots between "Hardcore" and "Nightmare" on Quake III Arena's scale, but I feel that's quite an overstatement. How could multiple bots at that difficulty level pose almost no challenge for me, but worse still, ALL get negative scores?! Oh please let that just be a glitch, cause that's just embarrassing. =s\n\nI want to enjoy this game, I really do. I LOVE arena shooters.

It's fast-paced, you are given certain classes to choose from, and it's f***ing awesome. You can play singleplayer and spawn in bots to practice against, or you can play with friends in multiplayer.\n\nBUUT, there are the few downsides. First of all, there aren't many servers, and it isn't widely played. The only real chance of having fun in multiplayer is if you have a group of friends and scheduled a time to play with them beforehand. I haven't made contact with the developers, but from what I heard, they aren't very friendly, and don't like all the criticism the community has given them. They also may have given up on the game entirely, but I'm not sure.\n\nSo to sum up: Fun game, but not too big of an active community.","October 15, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
