"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/293660/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Tri Of Friendship And Madness is yet another puzzle game shown from a first person perspective. I love these kind of games.  But is it as memorable as the Portal games or Q.U.B.E. ? Maybe. Let’s find out.\n\nTri drops you into the world of the Odd Gods where you have to complete 16 stages in order to find out what happened to two of the foxes that once inhabited the world. You’re being guided by a ghostly figure that gives you cryptic advice and messages. In each of the levels presented your goal is to collect the three hidden fox statues and to put them on their pedestal. Once all three statues have been placed on the pedestal you’ll be able to exit the current level and progress to the next one.\nThe game has a soothing and relaxing atmosphere. You can take your time; there’s no rush, but if you want you can beat your previous ‘records’ by replaying a level as quickly as possible, by collecting all of the hidden idols or by using the minimum amount of triangles. These triangles are an important part of the gameplay, so let me tell you a little more about it.\nYour character carries a device that allows him to create triangular platforms. You can do this by pointing and clicking the mouse. The game will automatically complete the platform once three points have been placed but you have to take into account that there are many rules that make it impossible to ‘just’ create a platform. No, that would be too easy. For example, you can’t create platforms on wood. You also can’t create platforms in ‘corrupted’ spaces, and since the platforms created are in 2D (remember that you can only place a maximum of 3 ‘entry’ points) there’s no real depth or thickness in them. There are more factors to take into account, but I’m not going too far into this. It’s something you’ll experience and see for yourself.\nEach level also has an amount of golden idols to collect. These are usually hidden in places you normally can’t reach so you have to carefully set up your platforms in order to be able to collect these. They don’t add anything to the experience, but it’s a fun side activity nevertheless.\nA new ‘power’ will also unlock every couple of levels. The first one obviously allows you to create the platforms themselves, but the second one will allow you to walk on walls by carefully placing your triangles. There’s also a power that will let you redirect light and teleport.\nThe first couple of levels are very simple and can be finished in a matter of minutes. Halfway through the game becomes a bit harder and completing a level can then take anywhere between 15-60 minutes. Since you’re able to walk on walls after just a few hours of playing you can imagine it can get quite complicated; the camera will rotate often and some people might experience motion sickness because of it.\nThe puzzles are actually very fun - and sometimes also very challenging – to solve. You can’t die, so you can experiment as much as you want. You won’t fall to your death and you won’t get killed by enemies (because there are none). The mysterious story and characters make you want to keep playing, just to see what might’ve happened. The story isn’t 'in-your-face'; you have to think for yourself here, so it makes for a good incentive. A job well done, if you ask me.\n\nThe graphics are simple with relatively basic geometry. Graphically it reminded me of the game Kairo; it uses the same kind of soft graphics. But there certainly are more colors to be found in the world of Tri. Some of the levels also have a Japanese atmosphere, because of the lighting, use of colors and some of the objects in it (like lanterns). The visuals won’t blow your mind, but they definitely get the job done.\nAnd the music: well, the music is… different. I thought that there were a lot of ‘world music’ influences in the game, with music similar to African and Japanese ‘tunes’. It’s subtle and not ‘in-your-face’, but it’s definitely something you’ll notice while playing. There are practically no sounds, with just a ‘hnnng’ sound for jumping and sounds for creating triangles. It’s all very basic stuff.\nThe voice acting is also limited (so far) to only one character. But this person does quite a decent job at pulling off a convincing, yet mysterious, character.\n\nThe length depends on your skill and intelligence. Some might finish it in 10 hours I think, others (like me) might take a little longer. Some levels are harder than you might think, and even though I’ve been stuck on the same puzzle for a few hours now I’m still enjoying it. Maybe because there’s no time limit or the fact that I can do what I want, trying to figure things out at my own pace. In any case, it’s a good sign. The length is perfectly fine for a game with this price.\n\nYes, yes; Tri is yet another game that can be added to the list of already excellent first person puzzle games like Portal and Q.U.B.E.  It introduces a new gameplay mechanic that’s original and one that works surprisingly well, even in puzzle format. The mysterious atmosphere makes you want to keep playing and the increasingly difficult puzzles are(mostly) fun to solve.\nAll in all this is a great game for puzzle enthusiasts.\n\n[Rating: 82/100]","October 9, 2014","true","9.5"," 62 of 69 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","62","69","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serotoninphobe/recommended/293660/","serotoninphobe","Serotoninphobe (Farewell ¥15)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serotoninphobe/","554 products in account","This, is what I define as a "Hidden Gem". By 8th Jan 2016, the game only received 150+ reviews on the steam store page, which is far from a satisfactory number compared to its excellence. What a Pity.\n\nThe game, TRI: Of Friendship and Madness, is possibly the best First Person Puzzler I have played in 5 years (since Portal 2). Of course, as to artistic merit, the game falls far behind titles like Talos Principle or Antichamber, which is clearly not the main focus of the game anyway. However, when it comes to gameplay, especially level design, the game is definitely among the best ones in the category (way better than the previous two).\n\nLike every other hidden gems, this game is flawed, every outstanding aspect of the game, is paired with something not correctly done, which I'll break into details in the following paragraphs. Nonetheless, as I always believe, with flaws come the personality and sincerity, which are the criterions I used to define good works.\n\n\n【Mechanism】\n\nGoods: The core mechanism and most puzzles are nicely designed, both logically and aesthetically. It's a rare one in the First Person Puzzler category that really nailed the 3D thinking, I mean, seriously into a 6DOF level. In fact, let's take a look back, aren't most puzzles in other First Person Puzzlers can be easily recreated in a 2D game? (Yes, I'm referring to Talos Principle here.) But not in this game, the refreshing experience you would have when walking upside-down on the ceiling, is as inspiring as Portal provided years ago.\n\nBads: While the core mechanism gives you a large range of freedom, it can also be easily exploited and overused. In more than one circumstance，I accidentally used some tricky/cheaty way to break the puzzle, which I'm pretty sure is not the intention of the developers. It might be welcomed by some players, but I personally do not like it, for it makes me feel as if I broke the game, along with its immersion and gaming context. It makes me feel ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ too, especially after I discovered the legit way to do so later on.\n\n\n【Level Design】\n\nGoods: Levels (after the first few ones) are huge and imaginative, full of secrets and alternative paths, the most important of all: WITHOUT ANY NAVIGATION (or a minimum amount of). This might sounds like a downside for modern gamers, but a diamond for nostalgic gamers like me. The game has all kinds of surprise in full stock waiting for you here and there , which simply gives you a sense of adventure and exploration, in your full control, unlike any other roller coaster experiences modern games would provide. It's hard not to relate this game to those old school classic FPS of the 90s with these elements, such a sweet déjà vu.\n\nBads: Although I speak highly of its overall level design, the first few levels of the game are rather tedious and uninspiring, which I'm afraid is the major reason that prevents more people from knowing the game. But trust me, if you are patient enough to make it through the first quarter of the game, you will be amazed by how ambitious and imaginative the levels are afterwards.\n\n\n【Audio Design】\n\nGoods: The soundtracks are special, they are definitely not the best but certainly among the most special tracks I have heard in video games. They are not those generic ambient tracks you would normally expect in many other puzzle games, but some world/tribal music instead. Some of them also have an alienated context within, which contributed greatly to the theme of the game.\n\nBads: But strangely, half the tracks end so suddenly with a harsh fadeout, almost felt like unfinished. And what's worse, is the voice sound effects of the player controlled protagonist, which is laughably bad. If by any luck the developers can read this, I strongly suggest you guys to improve this part a bit. For it is, by far, the shortest plank of the game I can come up with.\n\n\n\nSo conclusively, if you're looking for an awe-inspiring experience and have enough patience and tolerance for those aformentioned flaws in the game, you would not regret to give it a try. Additionally, for achievement hunters like me, this is also a must-buy, there is no grinding achievement at all but all gameplay booster.","January 8","true","17.2"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","35","36","2","0"

Once I started playing, I really tried to love this game. I really tried. I got thirteen levels in before I couldn't escape that I hate this game more than any game I can ever remember hating.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why. Many are nitpicks, but there is one overwhelming one: This Game Is Almost Never Fun. I started out enthusiastic, but it wasn't long before all the enjoyment drained out. I went from looking forward to the next level, to only wanting to complete the current one just so it would be over and done with. I could not help contrast Tri with games like Portal or QUBE where, most of the time, the challenge is in figuring out the puzzle. Once you know how it's done, you can do it. In Tri, this is not the case. Realizing the solution just means understanding how much tiring, precarious, exacting, chore-like work you have to do before you can DO the thing you figured out how to do. This is a game where there is no such thing as a simple solution. If solving a puzzle can be made more difficult, it has been. Not in a mentally challenging way, but in a way that feels like having to walk for miles over uneven rocks. (Especially once they introduced having to direct light beams by reflecting them off triangles. This requires innumerable microscopic adjustments each time.)\n\nAnd even that would be fully forgiveable, if the game's difficulty was FAIR. For me, half my frustration came from the increasingly difficult puzzles, the other half came from inconsistent mechanics. Sometimes when I had to run up walls, a triangle that showed I could walk on it would suddenly let go of me and I'd plummet. Sometimes I got trapped in places I should have been able to jump out of. Sometimes lasers would bleed right through triangles I put up to block them (In one case, I had to layer down twenty-four of them). But the worst was the jump. At first I thought it was a nifty idea that if you were jumping towards a high ledge, you could keep pressing space to haul yourself up and over. I grew to hate this mechanic because of how often it failed. Jumping up a simple step could take five or six tries; impotently bobbing up and down going "HUHHP! HUHHP! HUHHP!" each time. There were also plenty of times when it seemed like random chance whether a given platform could be jumped to or not. Plus there was the tendency of jumps to send you up and over a thin ledge you were trying to reach, instead of onto. I quicksaved OFTEN.\n\nTri feels like it lives up to its name: they tried. They really did. They had ideas with a lot of potential and the level design is frequently gorgeous. But too often these ideas were implemented poorly, or were not conveyed at a reasonable difficulty level. I quit. I don't want to, and I am massively disappointed to, but I'm giving up and uninstalling this game. I know I'll never see the end cutscene, but honestly, not playing anymore feels like more of a reward to me.","March 18, 2015","false","18.2"," 46 of 57 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","46","57","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/recommended/293660/","CueZero","CueZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/","1640 products in account","Transported to a world of colorful and almost paper-mâché-like surroundings, set to the eerie trip-hop beats of the melody playing and its mysterious sounding eastern strings weaving in and out of your eardrums; TRI is certainly a world of mystique and ancient mystery, and it bleeds with a style that stands out from the rest.\n\nYou find yourself in a peaceful garden of zen, a wise robed and masked figure greets and leads you through your relaxing surroundings to the base of a shrine. Here he explains the story of two foxes with a symbolic relationship obviously revered by the people of this temple. As the title suggests, the friendship of these two once playful spirits has been driven to madness and your spiritual guide requests your help in locating and finding out what really drove these two sacred beings apart from each other. As you step through the portal you've been led to, this is where the game takes a twist from the relaxing to the oddly enchanting and mystic world of the Odd Gods.\n\nYour objective for each ancestral act of the game seems simple enough; collect the three shining fox statues scattered throughout each sprawling temple of dream-like obstacles and bring them to their pedestal to activate the strange portal. As you'll soon discover after only a couple short levels, these fox statues all seem to be out of reach. Luckily, you quickly come across the very free-form and useful triangle creating ability. This allows full creativity and endless possibilities with how you construct your spiraling walkway towards each out-of-reach goal.\n\nLost in these ancient maze-like structure feeling like some kind of wild animal wandering throughout a huge human contraption. You'll weave your triangles into complex structures to create stairs and bridges, and when you look back you'll marvel at a unique pattern of your own making like a proud spider with its completed web.\n\nAs you move through through each esoteric structure that acts as a separate stage you'll come across your spiritual masked guide again who pushes you in the right direction and fills you in on the rich lore and history of the world you've become enshrouded by. Who is this masked entity though? He obviously feels very compelled to protect the friendship between the two main fox gods, but his motivation and identity remain decidedly unclear throughout the story.\n\nIt's easily the most entrancing and thought provoking setting I've seen for this kind of a game, and it's actually enjoyable to play through to the end which was a bit of a surprise considering my rough history with puzzle-oriented games. I loved the concept of Antichamber and it's ilk of mind-bending brain teasers but just could not get into it. The concept was a mind opening experience but it was soul crushingly challenging, games like that or Portal often times made me feel stupid, I love them to death but I just spent most of the time wishing I could keep going without getting stuck every other room and taking in the beautiful and mind-bending visuals around me.\n\nTRI challenges you just enough but keeps you moving fluidly through its surreal and colorful world, the pacing is impeccable. Instead of making me feel slow and inadequate it causes me to feel crafty and wise like the ancients who roamed its hallways before me, these seemingly impossible to reach spaces become closer to reach as you craft your serpentine bridges and staircases of colorful triangles with ease and just a touch of contemplation.\n\nThroughout the entire journey for the wise and playful Fox god new powers are being thrown at you, and they do a fine job of shaking things up and keeping the pace exciting. Most notable was the acquisition of the wall walking relic which allowed me to traverse the surface of any connected triangles of my creation, even while sideways or upside down. Within minutes I was constructing interweaving triangle stairs that spiraled up the side of walls and upside down against ceilings giving me a serious feeling of vertigo as I hung high from the tops of the palace.\n\nThe levels often times play tricks on your mind, and you can catch a glimpse of a fox sneaking by as you turn around and re-enter a room and notice everything has been completely turned upside down. Is it the elusive and playful fox god we give chase to that plays these tricks on us as we navigate the puzzles of the world of the Odd Gods?\n\nThis is exactly the kind of memorable sleeper hit I would expect Rising Star Games to take notice of and pick up, and having another strange, beautiful and otherworldly title in their growing library of classics is why they're at the top of my list of favorite publishers right now.","October 24, 2014","true","19.4"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","34","38","0","7"

You place triangles that allow you to climb, walk on walls, and reflect light beams. There are many challenging puzzles, and many cool puzzle mechanics, especially if you are interested in finding all of the hidden statues. The art is very pretty, and sometimes very abstract, which fits the game perfectly. The music plays in segments with silence in between, and while it fits the game, it can get a bit repetative if you are stuck on a level for a long time.\n\nHowever, dispite all the wonderful things about the game, there are times when I hate it. The puzzles can be VERY hard, especially in the later levels, and I had to look up videos or search the forums in order to progress. When bending light, minute changes in a triangle can greatly affect where the beam lands, and I often placed as many as 30-50 triangles to get the light to land in the goal. (Note: if you use the tab button to fix your head and make your triangles exactly the way you want, you end up with much fewer triangles, but you still often spend a great deal of time making tiny changes) I did not discover the quick save (F5) button until very near the end, and there were times where I would die and get greatly set back, especially when I collected statues since the save. It was not uncommon in the later levels for me to wander around aimlessly for as much as 20 minutes trying to figure out how to progress. Some times I wouldn't pick up on a new mechanic being introduced and end up placing dozens of triangles to brute force my way through the puzzle. Triangles would also place oddly, either refusing to create for no apparent reason, or placing prematurely, requiring more work to get the exact triangle you needed.\n\nAnd then comes the idol statues. In each level there are around a dozen little statues hidden in tiny nooks and cranies. As an achievement enthusiast, I had to get every one in order to 100% the game. This process would have been excruciatingly painful had I not used the guide (which is awesome). I would have wandered around, spending insane amounts of time backtracking and searching every square inch for fake walls or hidden coridors, constantly worrying about missing something. The time I spent in the game would likely be three times what it is, and it wouldn't have been fun. It was this feeling of banging my head against the wall to find the last idol (sometimes difficult even with the guide) or trying to cross an acid pit that took the fun away from the game and make the last few levels feel like a chore.\n\nI spent a lot of time deciding whether or not to recommend the game, and I finally decided on recommending it, but with this warning: play casually. Don't sit down and think "I'm going to get all the statues in the last two chapter", because you won't enjoy it, it will be hard, painful work. Think instead, "I'm going to enjoy this game" and play through what you get through, and do it calmly. Try not to get overly frustrated at a problem, and if that does happen, take a break! If I had done that, my experience with the game would have been SO MUCH more enjoyable.","August 11, 2015","true","21.4"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","20","20","0","0"

The game's campaign is also pretty lengthy for what it is, where i thought it would have ten levels max, but it actually has sixteen levels which is great.\n\nThe story isn't something to brag about but it definitely is very charming and with somewhat adorable (two) characters, and the ending was a nice satisfying happy one.\n\nThe bad things about the game is that there's a lack of a hint/help or a guide system which the game does need in my opinion in late, specifically speaking from chapter thirteen to sixteen, having to spend on one of those levels more so than the time spent on all past levels, trying to solve the puzzles in them. Also there's a problem with motion sickness that one might have during some of the levels in the game which it did get my dizzy but could handle it, but others may not be able to.\n\nI was surprised and happy with how the game plays out with how much content is in it, and how creative their mechanics in terms of solving puzzles is, and overall the general quality of the game being good, seeing as how the price of the game is 15$ on Steam, and I'm happy to recommend this game for what you get in the overall package.\n\nShameless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.","November 11, 2014","true","35.0"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","0"

It's beautiful, and the story gives a reason to press forward through the game, but the level design and the tough but fair puzzles are where the game truly shines.\n\n\nInitial gameplay is straightforward. Explore the levels, place triangles as platforms, look in side areas for the hidden idols. The game quickly moves into spatial reasoning, with the triangles aligning your gravity with them, giving plentiful freedom of motion. Levels progressively grow more open-ended, giving full use of that freedom of motion; anything you see, you can explore, as long as you can figure out how to get there.\nWhile the game mechanics remain simple, the world itself (and its playful nature about the laws of physics) allows for numerous applications, giving the puzzles a great variety. The levels aren't too difficult to complete, but the idols hidden throughout the world give a reason to really explore, leading one into the most clever puzzles the game has to offer.\n\nTri is a very relaxing game; the peaceful world, soothing music and calm Monk companion give the game a lovely atmosphere. As for the gameplay, timing-related puzzles are few and far between, nothing can kill the player except static environmental hazards, and the level design encourages exploration and taking one's time.\n\n\nPersonal assessment: Tri is absolutely fantastic. The open level design and integration of the puzzles into the levels as a whole makes the entire game feel like a cohesive package. It's not super long, but towards the end the puzzles are so different from one another that it stays fresh the whole way through.\nMy favorite moments are the puzzles that violate natural laws to the point that they look literally impossible at first glance, and the puzzles that are so mind-bending that even when past them you don't know if you actually solved it or if you missed the point entirely.\nYour Mileage May Vary; many of the puzzles don't have well-defined boundaries or completion rules. While I very much enjoy that aspect, some may find it hindersome when going for full completion. The game is very much worth an initial playthrough, though.\n\n\nBottom line: if you have the time to let your mind be melted by a fox and a bunch of triangles, Tri is a great experience.","March 11, 2015","true","38.2"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","18","18","0","0"

It is a puzzle-exploration game. In each level there is a locked teleporter, which require three keys to open. Your task in each is the find the keys, find the teleporter and continue to the next level. Off course things do get complicated as you go along. To help you navigate the levels, you get the "Tri" - an artifact capable of producing triangle. The triangles can be created anywhere, as long as each corner is anchored somehow, and they are not too large. As you go along, the "Tri" can be used in more or less three ways - to create platforms, to be used to walked on walls and ceilings (dont ask...) and to bend light. The use of the "Tri" is fundamental to complete the levels.\n\nThere are in total 16 levels in the game, and if you know exactly where you are going and doing, some of them can be beaten in 10 min or so, though others require 20 min just to walk from start to exit through mazes. However, this is if you know the puzzles already, your first play through expect to spend 20-60 min on levels just to solve them. Added to this, there are an  x number of idols hidden on each level, some of them very devious. These are not required to finish the game, but you unlock concept art and such by finding them. Finding all will take a lot of time searching and head-scratching.\n\nThe game in not "trippy" as such, it is in fact quite serene. The mood of the game is peaceful, and it is much more cerebral than twitchy. The puzzles are logical, and the physics are 'real', so do not expect any subversive puzzles like Antichamber.

Since then, I've tried to play all of them from titles like Qbeh-1 to Path to Thalimus and I have to say, TRI has impressed me a lot more than most. The story line is pretty decent but the thing that really impressed me the most were the puzzles. You get to create these triangle sheilds that can be used as many things from platforms to mirrors that reflect light, all adding several possibilites to completing most the temples(Test Chambers) and finding all the secrets, and if you're into these types of games, I'm sure you're gonna want to find all the secrets and the exploration really makes you use your imagination when it comes to completing a temple 100%. There is also scores for best times and least triangles used, a great feature that adds to the replayability of the game. I remember playing portal and trying to get the least amount of portals as I could and the hours I spent doing it. I'm sure that will follow with this game as well. The only feature that I think could make this any better would be some type of 2 player online coop, but even without it, it's great fun. I definitely recommend picking this up if you're into these types of games, you won't be dissapointed. Oh and did I mention the graphics feel like a magical cell shaded deep space minecraft :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNM4lkEdb6g","October 9, 2014","true","2.6"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

Dare I say even on par with portal if not more.\n+ Further adding onto the mechanic (walking on walls and reflecting laser/light beams) as you progress in the game.\n+ A good range of difficulties to keep you thinking throughout the game.\n+ Really nice soundtrack\n+ Unique cartoon/abstract/colorful environment\n+ Some platforming in the later levels\n+ A decent length to finish the game 5-7 hours (15+ if you try to find all idols)\n+ Interesting traditional asian-like storyCon:- The last few levels ramp up quite a bit in difficulty (especially if you're trying to find all the idols)\n- A few of the idols, at least in my opinion, seemed a bit 'mean' (unfair) so-to-speak in trying to find them.\n\nOverall I really did enjoy this game. I played through the whole game 'and' found all idols without any walkthroughs or guides. There were a few stuck moments but I have to admit this game did a phenomenal job in the overall difficulty. Personally, I have seen most puzzle games either be too easy or too hard (to the point I have to get help with figuring it out or give up). This game, in my opinion, has the difficulty just right so you don't blow through the puzzles but also don't sit 30+ minutes not knowing what to do (I only had a few moments like that and it was usually from trying to find an idol).\n\nThis game really does bring a whole new (3d) solving element in trying to figure out puzzles. I can't really put a term to what it's like but once you get to the point you're walking on walls/ceilings, you will have moments where you forget which way is up or down; I just found it neat sometimes realizing I was upside down for 5-10 minutes trying to do a puzzle. Not sure if it will happen to you but I definitely had "mind = blown" moments with some of the puzzles!\n\nSome people might find the overall story not to be interesting, but even if you are one of those people I heavily recommend to look past that and play the game for what it fundamentally is: a unique FPS Puzzle. Personally I liked the story (it has an traditional asian story-telling feel to it), but I have seen a few say otherwise so here is hope they will look past that!\n\n9.5/10","December 8, 2014","true","20.8"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

I was really impressed with this game. And really immersed too, where did those 20 hours even go...\n\nAt its core, TRI is a first-person puzzle platformer with relatively small levels jam-packed with secrets to find, on top of the main collectibles. The difficulty curve is pretty smooth, but steep; the game expects you to think outside of the box and be very aware of what you can and can't do. There's a ton of clever level design and puzzle design, and a lot of variety too.\n\nThere are a few minor flaws; chapter 13 is kind of ehh bad. Dying to acid or lasers makes you reload a save, which seems a bit much. Granted you'll end up saving a ton once you get to levels where you can die just so that doesn't happen, and usually it's only a minor inconvenience, but I don't see why it had to be that way. Oh well. There's also a few too many "hidden behind fake tile" secrets, but they still aren't that prevalent and most of them have some indication.\n\nOther than that? A lot to love. I really can't explain why it's great without spoiling puzzle solutions or the quirks of the mechanics, but it's well worth your time to play.

First of all, it's about foxes, and I love foxes more than anything in the universe.  Second of all, the game is a lot of fun, it's well designed, the art style suits it, the music is great, and the puzzles are very well designed.\n\nWhat you do in this game is you use triangles to traverse areas and solve puzzles.  As the game progresses you get a few additional powers for the triangles which are used for later puzzles.  The puzzles slowly get more and more complex and challenging and are a lot of fun.\n\nThe game has a somewhat Portal feel (at least to me) in how you go about solving puzzles; especially later on in the game once you have all the powers and the puzzles require more thinking.  As well, the puzzles don't always obey they laws you expect them to obey, but you learn how they work fairly quickly (although most of them obey the same laws).\n\nIt's a fairly relaxed game in that you can't really die (but you sort of can).  If you fall into the void you're just reset (and you will fall into it quite a bit), but if you touch a red light beam or fall in acid you die and have to reload a save.  Those hazards aren't introduced until later though.  Either way, it's easy enough to not fall in, and if you come across a point where you see these hazards just save the game as you can save anywhere (the game does autosave as well at various check points just so you don't have to restart the whole level in the event of forgetting to save and dying).\n\nYou have to find three fox statues (called key statues) throughout each level and then bring them back to a certain area where you put them on pillars and they activate a portal to the next level.  There are various golden fox statues (called idols) hidden throughout the levels as well.  You don't need to collect these but they unlock bonus content (the bonus content seems to just be development notes and level commentaries; you also get achievements for collecting certain ones).  Some of them are hidden in fairly obvious places whereas others are hidden in extremely well hidden places (such as places where you would think you're not supposed to go).  Some are even hidden in plain sight but getting to them is very difficult.\n\n\n\nI'm not sure what else to say about this game, but you should definitely buy it if you like puzzle games.\nAnd it works on Windows, Mac, and Linux; which is really nice as I prefer to play games only on Linux.  :p","October 29, 2014","true","13.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","3"

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","I have never before played a puzzle game as long as an RPG in my life. But damn it if I didn't love my time with this game! Even when I spent possibly two hours on one of the "expert" puzzles, I found the game enticing from beginning to end.\n\nWarnings!\nThis game is HARD. It will force you to think differently in order to beat this game's puzzles. Most challenges are for experts, but even the main puzzles are no simple matter.\nI do not recommend this game to be played with a controller. You spend a lot of time drawing up triangles, and in later levels you will have to micromanage each one.\nTurn down the triangle-textures as you're going to draw a lot of them. Your performance will improve greatly.\nMechanics\nWhat is TRI? TRI is a FPS puzzle-platformer that combines a single main-mechanic throughout the whole experience (after you find the TRI in Chapter/Level 3) a la Portal and the unreal, illogical world of Antichamber.\n\nThere are some platforming skills at your disposal such as climbing edges by holding the jump button or climbing into holes by holding both the jump and the crouch button. This last mechanic can be picky at times, but you can get by with climbing and crouching throughout most of the game.\n\nThe execution of this game makes me wish a game would utilize Mirror's Edge controls with an interesting game mechanic for speedrunners to make puzzles both challenging in reflexes and in the thought process.\n\nUnlike games such as QUBE and Magnrunner Pulse, you are allowed to draw triangles on just about every surface, except wood. You gain an ability later to scale triangles on walls and later to bounce light on triangles. Afterwards, the game is at your whim for how you want to go around the levels.\n\nThis greatly improves the replayability as you can challenge yourself to find alternative paths or be more efficient with your triangles and time.\n\nDespite how difficult I've said the game is at some parts, the game scales its difficulty fairly throughout the first ten or so chapters. After Chapter 10, you better have mastered drawing triangles because you're going to draw a lot.\n\nEach new level/chapter introduces something new that you have to experiment with to figure out what is going on, and some stages might be more expansive than others or more laybrinth-like.\n\nThe goal of every stage is to collect three red fox statues to open the portal to the next level. These can be tracked with waypoints by pressing the highligh key (H). There are also secret golden idols in every level that require you to either explore every aspect of the level, look more closely at the level, or challenge you to take the harder challenges.\n\nThese golden idols unlock some developer commentary, prototype pics, level layout pics, etc. But the real reward for these idols is the challenge of 100% the levels by finding all the secret and the super secret idols. The downside is that too many rely on visual-illusions that you might grow tired of quickly.\n\nNarrative (No spoilers)\nThe story is about the Monk, Blue and Red (the Old God Foxes). You are just some human disciple of the Monk, and there's no backstory behind your character.\n\nI don't think this is much of a spoiler because the game never really cares about who you are, only about the world and the other characters. (Even in the developers' commentary, they said they scrapped the idea of giving you a backstory because it wasn't worth it).\n\nThe Monk can be thought of as your GLaDoS, but he won't make quips at your failures; he'll be your source of exposition and some encouragement. I don't think his VA is bad at all, but if you're expecting some rich character like GLaDos, I think you'll be disappointed.\n\nAfter every other level, you'll recieve a cutscene that gives some more exposition. The twist of the game is somewhat expected a mile away, but the story is servicable and I quite like the narrative. This game is a case of more style and gameplay over story substance.\n\nThe only gripe I have with the story is I don't quite like how the game handles the idea of madness; it treats the matter as a temporary condition rather than a permanent affliction.\n\nNow I'm not one to not encourage more happier endings, but I think the developers missed out on the opportunity to flesh out the idea of friendship and of madness in treating both things with more consequences. It's something I think this game could've easily done better.\n\nBut it's clear the game wanted to focus more on making a relaxing, mind-bending puzzle game than a serious story.\n\nBest Experience--Reccomendation\nAs I mentioned beforehand, in order to complete 100% of every level, you need to find all the golden idols. I would recommend at least being a completionist for the first ten levels/chapters.\n\nEach of these extra challenges will make you more accustomed to the game's mechanics and they will get your head around some of the possibilities you can do. The secrets are not artificial time-wasters; they give you a better opportunity to explore every aspect of the level and become familiar with the TRI.\n\nIf you're tired of going after the idols by chapter 9 or 10, stick with collecting the red fox statues. If you think you can handle more mental strain, go for the long run and try to 100% the game.\n\nPros & Cons Summary\nPros\nTHE SOUNDTRACK! If you love Rayman, boy do I have the soundtrack for you.\nA difficult puzzle game.\nSimple, yet frustratingly deceptive mechanics and puzzles.\nLots of content to get out of this game.\nFoxes, foxes, foxes, and vulpes gods.\nSimple story for young and old.\nBeautiful scenary and very thought-out level design.\nCons\nA difficult puzzle game. Frustration in the later part of the game with the golden idols. (Chapter 10 onwards)\nCrouch Button + Jump Button = NOT FUN\nToo many visual illusion puzzles and one-time kind of puzzles.\nSimple narrative and characters.\nNuances with drawing triangles over the simplicity of the Portal gun.\nSome levels feel way too big or take too long to navigate.","June 20, 2015","true","25.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I watched the trailer. I loved it. The idea is pure genius. I played the demo later. I loved that too. I then waited patiently for the game to release, all the while playing the demo a lot. Then it was released. I was ecstatic. Now, enough about me, the game!\nThe game starts with an easy tutorial level, in which you are introduced to your "mentor", the Monk, and to the game's objective: finding his friend the Fox [if I remember correctly, in the alpha period of the game, the fox was evil and you had to look him the strange world]. You will also see "visions" of the Fox throughout the levels. You then go to the Odd God's world: a world mostly comprised of giant cubes filled with puzzles floating in the middle of emptiness. No wonder the Gods are called Odd! In the second level, you are introduced to this game's collectibles: the Idols of Unnessecary Knowldege. Just my type of thing [I love trivia]! The Idols unlock artwork, in-game commentary and info on the game while it was in developpment. Each level has a few Idols, and one super secret one. They are quite hard to find sometimes, and not mandatory to beating the game. The TRI is encountered in the third level, if I am not mistaken. It works really well. If the TRIs are yellow, you can walk on them, if red, you cannot. You also cannot place TRIs on wood [which has the beautiful meaning that TRIs can only be put on an eternal materials. Well, to me]. Later in the game you encounter the GraviTRI [not the official name], which gives each TRI it's own gravity: if you have a slanted TRI, your gravity will become slanted too when you walk on it. So you could make a chain of TRIs that lead to the ceiling and walk on the ceiling! I read some people had motion sickness, but I [thank the Odd Gods] did not. The games contains 16 levels, which seems short, but isn't. To finish a level, you must gather the 3 Fox Status and place them on an altar. The levels are beautiful, stunning and extremelly well-crafted and brain-melting at times. The music is just perfect. The game seems to be reparted in a few "sections", with each section having 3 music segments that loop. The music is so good that the looping is not a problem to me. The story is nice, simple and touching: a tale of friendship, madness, and Foxes. The game is fairly glitchless: the 2 glitches I encountered were fixed, and the last level had a slightly game-breaking glitch, but thankully Ratking told us how to fix it in the "stuck thread". The developper commentary is also a bit flawed: the music doesn't get less loud, unlike when you talk with the Monk: so you'll hear the the great music and  the devs talking about things at the same volume, which makes it hard to understand it at times.\nOverall, this is a great game. I loved it. I strongly recommend this to any amateur of FPS puzzle- and exploration-games. And you can buy the soundtrack! What's not to like?\nThank you, Ratking entertainment, for making such a unique and exceptionnal game. I love you!\nEdit:\nThe way death is handled is questionnable: if you fall in bottomless hole/void, you immediatly respawn at a predetermined point, which is nice. But if you touch a red lazer or acid, you die and have to choose a previous save. So make sure you save often.\nOh, and the TRIs are the magical triangle-platforms. When you create one, the world becomes grey, except for a coloured zone which indicates where you can place the next point. Maybe I should've mentionned that earlier...","November 8, 2014","true","24.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

For being a very relaxing game, the puzzles can tend to take a lot out of me and I will rarely complete more than one or two levels in a sitting.

Those interested only in completing the game can expect to finish in substantially less time, perhaps around 12 hours.\n\nSCORE:\n7 out of 10\n\nMy feelings about this game are in conflict, partly due to my expectation that it would have a heavier focus on actual puzzles and meaningful exploration.\n\nI spent the first 10 or so of TRI's 16 levels wondering where the puzzles were.  I figured that the platforming (enabled by the game's TRI mechanic, which allows the player to walk on walls and ceilings) would largely be an interesting means of navigating from puzzle A to puzzle B, which I would then solve to get the statuettes that are needed to proceed to the next stage.  Instead, the platforming itself often seemed to be the puzzle.  Reaching my goals was mostly about locating and climbing to them, not thinking about what actions I needed to take and in what order.  Even reaching areas that appeared inaccessible from the start was just a matter of moving through the level and, say, falling down the right hole.  The last third of the game began to incorporate some puzzles, but they were too little (too few, too simple), too late.\n\nI could have accepted this problem as a feature rather than a failure.  Perhaps the developers intended for the TRI mechanics to be the stars of the game instead of the puzzles.  Unfortunately, I found myself fighting with some of the TRI mechanics as well, particularly the light reflection.  There are "puzzles" that involve reflecting a beam of light off the player's placed triangles to hit a crystal, which powers some part of the environment.  For me, setting the three points of my triangles just so was very time-consuming and not fun at all, especially when the beam of light had to be reflected down hallways or holes in the ground to reach other rooms.  Sometimes the reflected light was dangerous, so I had to duck under or platform around it to get a good enough vantage point to precisely draw my next triangle.  Worse than the light beams, however, were the "kami", balls of light that follow a set, curving path from some spawner and bounce off your triangles.  The curve in their path is largely preserved after they bounce, so placing triangles to get the kami where I wanted them to go was even more difficult.  Fortunately, the most frustrating of these scenarios are intended to be completed only if the player wants to collect the optional golden idols.\n\nAs a completionist and fan of exploration in video games, I naturally sought out every golden idol.  Each level contains usually 9 to 14 of them, hidden in out-of-the-way nooks, in awkward ledges, in acid, behind bars that are lifted by pressing a button, and so on.  It's safe to say that locating and collecting these constituted the majority of my play time and that there would not be much game in their absence.  Sadly, they are the only incentive for exploration, since the environments themselves reveal little to nothing of the meager story or the world (universe?) in which the game takes place and generally feature nothing noteworthy except some opportunities for screenshots.  The golden idols also do not reveal more of the story, but they are not totally without value:  as the player collects them, he unlocks developer commentary and notes for each of the stages as well as achievements.  Still, I would have preferred some more game-related incentive for pursuing them, especially considering the time that went into doing so.  It doesn't help that there are no in-game clues, whether subtle arrows or "proximity pings", to their locations, especially when they are hidden behind wall tiles that look like any other.\n\nI have nothing bad to say about the other aspects of the game.  The levels are large and well-designed.  The art is lovely.  The sound is just right and the unobtrusive music suits the game.  The player can save at any time, including by quicksave; loading is quick; and any chapter can be replayed later.  The options menu allows for decent customization of the experience.  There is an optional "challenge mode" for each stage that involves using as few triangles as possible.  Unfortunately, the parts of the game that I care about most just didn't meet my high expectations.\n\nIf you're looking for a puzzler, rewarding exploration, or a deep story, this game is probably not for you.  If you're looking for a low-stakes, casual, (mostly) relaxing platformer with pleasant visuals, well-designed levels, and an interesting gameplay mechanic, consider buying it.  Just be aware that, given what it is, you may feel that the game overstays its welcome if you try to fully complete all 16 chapters.\n\nDespite the tone of my review, I would still say that I found the overall experience enjoyable enough to recommend it, especially given what I paid for it at a heavy discount.  Considering the size of the development team and the lack of games of this quality in this genre as well, I give it a 7 out of 10.

So what happened along the way?\nWhile I'm happy that the story is there and it feels like it really is an organic part of the game, what motivated me to play TRI is nonetheless the gameplay.\n\nGameplayThe main strength of the game are the mechanics and the (in part) anarchic puzzles.\nYour main tool to traverse the world and find the three fox statues that enable you to leave the level and progress to the next one is triangles.\nYou can build structures with them, like bridges and so on. But you can also walk on walls... and roofs.\nAnd you can use them to redirect light (which I am atrociously bad at btw...) or little Kami spirits.\nThe puzzles are super hard and make you think out of the box very often.\nAlso, there are a certain amount of optional collectibles in every level and let me tell you: In order to find all of these, you really have to have some masochistic character traits!\n(I'm trying to collect them all...)\n\nI play this game whenever I feel  like challenging myself and then it's rewarding as hell. It's not something for turning off your thinking apparatus and just killing time, though...\n\nI am currently in Chapter 13 from 16 and will edit this review if any of my impressions change but at this point I want to  strongly recommend this game!\n\nI made a Let's Play btw, but don't watch it... buy the game and play it yourself.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/recommended/293660/","TheIronicGamer","TheIronicGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/","1545 products in account","Tri is an underated puzzle game with a fantastically unique premise but sadly deserves a lot more attention than it is currently getting.\n\nThe games main puzzle concept relies on the use of these triangles you make called tri's. Initially these triangles have restricted use and can only be used to climb up walls. As you progress you unlock new uses for tri's. These include climbing up the sides of walls and reflecting light beams. These tri's are used to tackle every puzzle in the game.\n\nEach level is set in a large freely explorable area. Your goal is to find three red lion statues in order to order the portal to progress to the next level. Completing various puzzles around the level will help you find your way towards these statues. Each puzzle is unique in it's own way, some involving uses of other things such as boxes, buttons or light. Each has it's own unique challenge that can prove quite diffcult.\n\nWhat's even better about tri though is the way in which they create puzzles means they don't all have a single explicitly chosen solution. You can tackle many puzzles in your own unique way. Some puzzles will have only one solution possible but I found the majority to have multiple ways of doing. This personally adds highly to the user experience by not being restricted unnecessarily.\n\nPuzzle progression in tri works almost perfectly. I could feel the difficulty rising as I progressed through levels but it was never too quick that I couldn't keep up. Earlier levels in the game I could finish in less than 15 minutes but later levels ended up taking me in excess of 1 hour to complete.\n\nNow the reason I say the puzzle progression isn't perfect is because I believe they use the wrong premise to make the last 2 chapters the most difficult. These levels rely heavily on the reflecting light mechanic. The problem is that places tri's in the correct way to reflect light into the area you want it to is notoriously difficult. It's to the point that I almost gave up on the last 2 chapters. But I perseveared and the last chapter ended up taking me over 2 hours to complete because of this. I think the developers made the wrong choose to focus on this mechanic and it will leave a lot of people giving up out of anger.\n\nAchievement hunters will love tri too. Each level has these extra secret findables called idols. To find these is entirely optional but they unlock you bonus content at the main menu. Sometimes they are hidden in obvious places such as behind some stairs or in a small whole in the wall. But more often then not they require some create puzzling to get to. Through my playthrough I didn't manage to find many of these idols and I tried to look for them in every nook and cranny I saw. So I believe these are very difficult to find and would be great to keep people occupied throughout the game.\n\nTri has a good amount of content contained in it. There are 15 chapters in this game. Overall it took me almost 20 hours to finish the game. This is a good amount of time and content. I believe you could finish it quicker if you were better at puzzles than me though! If you were looking to collect each idol as well I believe this could easily add in excess of 10 hours of playtime to the game.\n\nIn terms of graphic style it is very unique and stylish. Tri is one of the most colourful games I have seen in a while. They really do focus on making sure each area is as colourful and unique as possible which I applaude to. The screenshots of the game is personally what caught my attention to buy it. Along with this great graphics style is an excellent soundtrack. It is full of calming music to accompany you through your journey and captures the spirit of the game perfectly.\n\nThe story in the game is forgettable at best. Tri's story is told through after level cutscenes and the occasional speaking in game. I couldn't remember any of the story for the life of me which isn't good for a game. It doesn't help either that the vocals are terribly voice acted in a voice that I suppose the person thought would be interesting and unique but is in fact incredibly annoying. Luckily though the gameplay makes up for the boring story.\n\nOverall tri is a puzzle game that really does deserve a lot more attention than it is currently getting. It is almost on par with other great puzzle games such as talos principle and portal. The issues I have with this game are mostly negligable. The issue with the last 2 chapters however did put my overall rating down slightly cause it annoyed me a great deal. But for a price of £12.99 it is quite reasonable for the amount of great content you'll be getting.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system\nDon't ever buy this game.\nNot recommended\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nRecommended\nHighly recommended\nA must play!\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","March 27","true","19.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

And holy hell what an amazing soundtrack it is, so I got the deluxe edition. TRI is the only game I've done this with.\n\nListen here: https://kingludi.bandcamp.com/\n\nAs for the game itself, TRI is a very stylized puzzle-platformer sporting some amazing architecture; a combination oriental vibes and colourful minimalism. You solve puzzles by creating triangles to use as platforms, and as you progress, you gain the ability to walk on these triangles on vertical surfaces, and reflect light off of them. In lieu of this is a story about two gods, a pair of foxes, parting ways for reasons that becomes clearer as you progress. And to aid you with that progress is a mysterious monk.\n\nGameplay is solid, puzzles go from easy to challening, the voice acting is really good.

This game needs for you to think outside the box- no, really. If you think inside the box you'll get stuck on 'Unwilling Walls' for at least two hours. Alas, you must also remember the basics and not overthink things, or you'll be doing somethinng horrifically advanced when all you need to do is just on a box and climb up the wall.\n\nGameplay - 4.5/5\nThe game spoonfeeds you the details and the things that you, the PC, can do. Theres no massive 'jump' and you're not alone in this journey, so if you find youself getting lost you should look back and try to run through things from the beginning and see if it's possible. Also, try to collect the Idols of Useless Knowledge, you really do need them. The art is amazing.\n\nStyle - 5/5\nDid I not mention I'm already in love with this game? The art style is both cartoonish and real, along with having cutsceens, smooth animations, and a whole new look on things. Put together Antichamber and Portal you'll get this. Honestly, this game is worth your money if you are the type to sit back and enjoy the little details.\n\nSound - 5/5\nWhoever the hell made this needs a trophy, cause they're amazing. Everything has a sound, but let me just fangirl for a moment. The MUSIC. Oh, the music is simply amazing! Get the soundtrack if you must but the music and background noises with both put you on edge and relax you, at the same time. I have honestly, in my whole life as a gamer and an artist/writer, never heard such beautiful music.\n\nStory - 4/5\nYou don't just play games to play games. Wait, some people do. Never mind that. All considerably additicing games need a good story, and this one's got it. It may seem a bit confusing at first, but like the gameplay the game spoonfeeds it to you, taking babysteps. Instead of your basic 'Once open a time, a hero(the PC) appeared,' theres a while backstory and cause for the mess that has become the realm of the Mad God. Why is there only two foxes? Why is only one considered a god when both are immortal? When are we finally going to catch Red? When is Blue going to show up? The questions haunt my dreams and demand that I come back and search for the answers, and I do.\n\nOverall - 18.5/20\nThis game is... well, plainly put it: Amazing. There has been no other games in all 1,000+ hours of steam gameplay that I've done that has wow'ed me in such a way. The game is smoothly put together and everything fits. It a massive milk puzzle, ( If you don't know what a milk puzzle is, it's a normal puzzle expect for that it's all white ) and /you/ have to be the one to paint the pieces in your own understanding a pathway in this game. If you find that the game is impossible, think this: The word 'Impossible' itself says 'I'm possible'! If I could, I'd buy twenty copies of this game and send every one of them to each one of my friends, I simply cannot get enough of TRI.... if only I wasn't stuck on the fifth level.

Great save system truly minimizes frustration that many new adventure games ignore.   If you like puzzles that make you think then I highly recommend. There is some hand holding but it it is vague, requiring you to think. There are also a few red herrings here and there.

I got to level 12 and just decided that I wasn't gonna play this game anymore. While I have heard discussion over an apparently quite large difficulty spike in the last levels, I didn't care enough to go that far. Why? To be quite blunt, this game is dull. Boring. In fact, for the first three levels, I questioned whether or not this game was even gonna be a puzzle game at all. In fact, I still kinda question that even after the fact. Let me go into details for the mechanics first before I start discussing why I don't think the implementation is very good.\n\nTri is a game about building triangles to solve problems. Essentially, you can create a triangle within a certain volume of space using three points which have to be connected to a wall. While you can't just stack triangles on triangles horizontally forever (in fact, there's a limit to this just due to the way triangles work), this does mean that you can put triangles most anywhere in the level. Unfortunately for the game, you can put triangles most anywhere in the level, meaning that solving a puzzle just becomes a matter of throwing enough triangles at the problem until it just kinda solves itself. This is my biggest problem with the game, and why I found it to be so boring. Never once throughout the game did I solve a puzzle and actually feel clever about its solution, which for a puzzle game can be an absolute killer. There are challenges that you can do which would want you to finish the area using as few triangles as possible, but it still stands that the core of the gameplay just isn't compelling enough to want to do these challenges.\n\nVarious gimmicks are introduced as you continue through the game, such as wood-paneled walls which you can't put triangle vertices on (because reasons), light reflection, death lasers and acid. This game also handles death in a really weird way; falling down a pit just respawns you at whatever location the map maker decided to respawn you at, and falling in acid or walking into a death laser actually causes you to die, forcing a load game. This game doesn't really autosave all that well, meaning that once you get to a section featuring such things if you are not manually saving quite often, you can lose a good deal of progress. You can use triangles to reflect the lasers (and in fact are required to do so to complete some tasks in the level), but it's super finicky and often just becomes a question of moving a vertex a centimeter or two in order to solve the puzzle, which as you may guess isn't too particularly fun either. It's especially not fun whenever a certain challenge in a certain level that introduces death lasers requires you to reflect said death lasers around yourself in tight corridors around walls, fearing risk of game over  and lost progress unless you quicksave all the time.\n\nThe level design is presented in a semi-linear way in that you have a fairly large level in which you spend a lot of time setting up ramps so that you can run up walls and maybe find where you have to go. Each level has three fox statues and any number of small fox idols; the former of which are required for completing the level and the latter are just for unlockable material, usually concept art. Each of the three foxes has their own "puzzle area," which is pretty much just an area where you do some vaguely puzzle-y things in order to get the fox statues. The fact of the matter is that this game really is an exploration game at heart, just with some kinda wonky puzzle mechanics thrown in there. If you're into that kind of thing you'll probably really enjoy this game, but I want something compelling. Maybe The Talos Principle spoiled me for puzzle games, but the degree of compelling exploration and puzzles I felt in that game just isn't here.\n\nThat's ultimately my biggest problem with this game; it didn't do enough to get me to care. I can tell that the team cared about the game; it's just that they didn't get me to care. Again, if you're into exploration games with some puzzles here and there, you'll probably have a better time with this game. If you're going into this expecting super clever puzzle design along the lines of games like Portal/The Talos Principle/Antichamber, just go play those games again. You'll have a better time over there. 5/10.\n\nStory: There's kind of a story and kind of a narrator, then there was something about two fox buddies and strife; I dunno. I gotta be honest, I was yawning too much because of the gameplay to really pay attention to the story. As such, I'm not gonna rate it.\n\nGraphics: As I've said in many reviews before, I'm a sucker for big architecture. This game definitely has some big architecture, but something just feels... off about the map design. I think it's just because it's a bit too blocky and inorganic for my liking, which admittedly is most likely a function of the way the game works, but I would've liked to see some more complex geometry here and there in the level design. The texturework is probably part of what throws me off as well. Ultimately, the biggest kicker with the level design is that it just feels like levels. It doesn't really often feel like you're exploring a world; you're just going through rooms. This is again something that the "big three" mentioned above may have spoiled me on, but I do think it's very important for puzzle games, when having a narrative, to have solid world design and not just solid level design. That, in my eyes is the biggest failing of this game as far as an art style goes. It sure has its style, but it doesn't feel... "natural". As far as the technical stuff goes, you've got some graphics sliders and your standard resolution options. It's been too long for me to remember whether this game launches at 1080p, but I seem to recall it doing so. There's also a really weird, grainy overlay that the game does which you may wanna turn off if it bothers you as much as it did me. This is again one of those things where I can plainly see that they put effort into this and really cared about their work, but it just doesnt' really have much depth to it as far as the graphical side of things. Beauty is skin deep with this game. 2/5.\n\nSound: The soundtrack for this game isn't all that bad; I just wish the game would make up its damn mind when it wanted to play the songs. During your time in a level, the "theme" for that level will just kinda start and stop whenever it feels like, which if you're anything like me, is really quite annoying. The songs themselves are quite bouncy, "ethnic" (I'm sorry, but I really couldn't think of a better adjective), and generally fun to listen to. It's just too bad the game can't figure out when to and not to play it. As for the voice acting and sound design, the voice acting is meh and the sound design is functional. Overall not bad, but I would rate it higher if the game didn't make me absolutely sick of some of the songs. 2/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 5/0/2/2; cumulative score of 4.7/10. It's right around the borderline between a recommendation and not a recommendation, but it's the overall lack of substance in nearly all respects that kills it for me. It's great for the first hour and a half, then you start realizing that it's pretty much just the same stuff over and over.","January 7, 2015","false","5.3"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","17","32","0","0"

Though the game is heavily derivative of Portal, it quickly goes in its own direction with the puzzles.\n\nAnd difficulty.\n\nAfter a tutorial level, you're given a Tri, a device that makes triangles which you can use to bridge gaps and make pathways up the walls and along the ceiling.  In later levels you use them to reflect light beams, guide lasers, and more!  And then you are told to find the fox.\n\nThe first ten levels or so are tantalizing and brain-teasing enough, and then level 11 hits.  From 11 to the end, the puzzles are MEAN!  Multi-step, thinking outside the box, taking these game mechanics and stretching what you can do with them to the very edge of reason!  There are some strange maneuvers you have to pull off, and figuring out what you have to do requires paying close attention to the environment.\n\nThe puzzles are mean in a good way.  Everything you need to solve them is right in front of you.  Learning to recognize what is possible with all these devices, how they behave, and how you must use the triangles to make them work together is mind-stretching.  This is not for casual players, and I like that.\n\nThese are expertly-designed levels.  Nothing is unfair, nothing is obtuse.  I finished the game without consulting a walkthrough, or taking any hints, and I am proud to have figured everything out by myself.  Those last two levels are a doozy--each taking me two sittings to figure out--but everything is logical.\n\nThe story is a bit thin.  It's told between levels instead of experienced as you progress, but that's a minor gripe.  I can see how the foxes went mad with this kind of freedom of movement.  I almost went mad figuring this stuff out.  Forget thinking with portals.  Thinking with Tris will kick your butt!\n\nI have only one real complaint: the music.  It's not bad music, but the way it's used is.  Each level has a segment of music which lasts one to two minutes, and this clip plays over and over and over, with about 30 seconds of silence in between.  On some levels, I heard the same 1-minute loop a hundred times, and it became so tiresome I often switched off the music and played my own.  The soundtrack is so much better when it's not broken up and looped.  I bought it as a symbol of my triumph!\n\nOther than this flaw, it's a wonderful game.  Superbly crafted levels, excellent use of its game mechanic, and foxes!","March 25, 2015","true","36.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

From what I gathered of the story (avoiding spoilers here), you are called upon to assist a holy guardian to help his friend, but both have lost their way.\n\nTRI challenges the player to invent their own solution to accomplish a similar goal in varying worlds of what seem to represent insanity. Yup. You're going to lose track of which way is up....in levels that actually have a defined "up".....and it's so much fun. The tools at your disposal are basically hands (to lift), feet (to move), mind (to go insane), and TRIangles (to defy physics, of course). The TRIangles are your control among the madness, allowing you to define which way is up.\n\nI loved playing this so much, from the very strange but addictive soundtrack to the way it throws you into each scenario without holding your hand.","December 22, 2014","true","18.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As you play the game you unlock different abilities (such as creating triangle platforms) and use these to collect the three red fox statues that unlock the next level.\n\nThe concept of the game is cool, the music is nice and the presentation is amazing. However it gets repetitive VERY quickly and the later puzzles are both frustrating and require a lot of trial and error (I spent 20+ minutes on some puzzles just changing the direction of my triangles). The triangles are difficult to manipulate (although the game does have a fix camera option) and sometimes you'll just slip off a triangle platform (doesn't happen much but enough to mention it).\n\nIf Steam had a "Mixed" recommendation then I'd go with that. TRI starts off great but becomes frustrating and repetitive as time goes on. If you're interested in TRI then I recommend buying it on sale.","September 11, 2015","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The art style of the game is very beautiful. The soundtrack is awesome. The game has 15 actual levels, which the first 5 lvls are nice and get more and more demanding in a good manner. After that, the levels start to  become brutaly difficult. Especially the last few levels are pure madness. This is because it is not like Portal (1 & 2), which had puzzles, that could be done in a way that wasn't hard to acomplish. I mean because portals aligned to a grid and had not to be put pixel perfect. In this game the triangles sometimes have to be put pixel perfect. There are almost no solutions and walkthroughs, but they don't really solve the problems for you anyway. You would never manage to put the triangles the same way as you might see it in a walkthrough. This especially concerns the puzzles where you need to reflect laser beams and randomly flying light projectiles.\n\nAfter all this game has real production value but I think most people will not finish the game.

I will not say more then that concerning the story as any more could give part of the story away. It has a vibe similar to that of some of the great puzzle games like Myst, Portal, and quite a few others where you are just thrown into this world with a little information and get the full story as the game goes forward.\n\nGraphically, the polish is fantastic. It's a strange realm you are going through. As it states in the game, the rules of the world aren't the same as our own. And it's right. If you suffer from motion sickness, you may want to play around with the FoV and/or limit your play sessions due to how odd the realms can get.\n\nThe music is a tad weird, but in a good way. Very memorable and can get stuck in your head for a while. I plan to pick up the soundtrack, which is included as dlc or in the collectors edition, cause I can't get enough of the music of this game.\n\nFinally, the puzzles. Some of them may leave you scratching your head for a while as there is no one way to solve any of them. I've gone through a few levels a few times already and I don't think I've used the same solution twice.  I will make this reminder for anyone looking to pick up the game. The Tri can do a few things and if thinks are looking impossible, try walking on the walls or the ceiling and look at the problem from litterally a new view. It can help alot.\n\nAs a whole, if this game even piques a little bit of interest, PICK IT UP. The two person dev team behind this did a phenominal job and  it is well worth the price to play in my opinion. I really can't wait to see what their next project is, but I hope it's as good as this one.","July 17, 2015","true","17.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One shouldn't expect a typical first-person adventure here - basically, you're exploring a multifarious world by creating solid two-dimensional triangles, for use as walking platforms.

It is a very cool concept that keeps evolving, which can certainly maintain a gamer's interest.  Also, the music is great.  Visuals are clean, and the concept is unusual and interesting.

I did not get tired of it once.\n\nThe visuals are just gorgeous, and loved the designs, it pops and is literal magic with the vibrant colors imo\n\nThe puzzles are very hide-and-seek, and remind me a lot of FEZ: easy going but challenging if you wish to find everything. You have a time, if you are a speed runner, and enough hidden items to make it fun for completionists.

Someone then recommended I try TRI for a spin. I love puzzle games, they're among my most favorite types to play. TRI rewards the unconventional player, and the "outside the box" mindset. In a world with invisible barriers and crappy rocks meant to hold a player in the "playable zone," TRI rewards the player who tries to get to unreachable spots. TRI has implemented mechanics and tools that I've not used in any other game so far, and that was refreshing. It's a fun game, and at times, pretty difficult. But the difficulty turns to sweet success when you figure out how to solve the problems. Bonus idols can be collected as an additional option in the game, making for an even longer playthrough. The art and soundtrack and story are also very well done, and I enjoyed looking at the bonus artwork as I unlocked it.

The controls are floaty and clunky, at best, and unusable at worst; I felt like I had to slam on the spacebar to get any real movement, and when the second task of the first room required jumping cleanly across, like, eight beams (spaced too close for the sprint jump and too far away for the single jump, forcing you to rely on the touchy "catch/pull up" mechanic) or start the level over, I closed it and resigned to never play it again.\nAlso: big rooms and motion blur?

There was no indication in the trailer of the camera behaving in this way. Unfortunately, as a result, I can't recommend this game.\n\nIn addition, the voice acting and script was awful - the guide character was very poorly cast for such a central role to the game.

We mostly follow vague hints – such as foxes that disintegrate the second they are approached – and not so much clear cut goals or an interesting storyline. Unfortunately this is what really makes this game an abjectly abhorrent experience. A lot of dizzying puzzling, with very little reward.\n\nThe story, as the name suggests, consists of the relationship between two foxes, being torn asunder, and in the process having their friendship tested. A test that, it seems, the player has a major part in (although the player is not one of these friends, or is he?) – signifying our insignificance outside of the grunt work, gameplay, that we are forced to do, for the sake of progression, of course.\n\nThe gameplay is an interesting novelty, puzzles that are to be solved with triangles in a myriad of different combinations and game-mechanics. There is a major issue with this free-form triangle-building (unless it's on wood), and that is that the correct solution is not readily available, it's really unclear what you are supposed to do, or the even more nebulous question if you're actually on the way towards a game-progressing idol, or an optional one. Because the different paths wind endlessly around the actual point of progression and side-rooms are a huge distraction and ultimately serve to muddle the main objective. A lot of the puzzle-solving devolved to a matter of stacking triangles to get high enough to jump to a place, which was the hight of frustration and tedium that I experienced, and, if intended, was just plain bad puzzle-design. Also, I managed to perform some jumps that did not seem to be intensional design, which proves both how frustrated I was to try maniacal jumping until I got where I wanted to be (and perhaps it proves how stupid I am) and how little sense there was to the level-design.\n\nBut to mention some positives, and perhaps touch on why I actually bought the game to begin with, before my thoughts was negatively infected by frustrating design-decisions. The game, when still novel, looks rather quaint. It has really nice colors, much like games such as Mirrormoon EP, a game I love the visual design of. Tri has that same wonderful visual style, but it wears out after you see the same texture for the nth time. The new experiences the game dolled out were fairly enjoyable, and I did enjoy the novelty of it, albeit it very temporary. The art in between the levels, the cutscenes, loadingscreens, set the tone and never felt discrepant, which is always nice to see a game get right.\nThe story seemed to be heartfelt, but can only really be judged on an individual basis, since I am far too cynical and bitter to enjoy the silly nature of a game like this. The writing and narration does bring the game down a bit – if you were to score it –, perhaps my expectations were too high, but the narration was really not well voice-acted, and the writing was but a reflection of that poor performance. I want to say that the writing sounded like a young adult trying to replicate a Tolkien prelude, but that may be too harsh, only probably not.\n\nSonically, Tri also fit the tone, and it was honestly one of the best parts of the experience for me, although, the overt stop and start of the loop, and the silence in between, created a kind of weirdness to the audible atmosphere, almost like it didn't fit, due to the vicissitude of its initiation and termination. Perhaps the music would be better suited in isolation, that is, listening to it while not playing the game.\n\nTri is a decent game, I am mostly writing this for equally bitter people who might get suckered in by the artstyle. The game is not what it seems, and that disappointed me, but it may be enjoyable to you. I am not going to recommend it, because I didn't find enough redeeming qualities to salvage or outweigh all of my quandaries and frustrations with the game, but you should not take my word for it. Some of the puzzles are really interesting and it's probably worth playing just because of the novelty that a game solely based on triangles possesses.","October 9, 2014","false","6.0"," 29 of 82 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","29","82","0","0"

Early on, you get the ability to create triangular platforms on most surfaces in the game. This mechanic seems simple enough, but you quickly discover that it gives you far more power and mobility than you might have originally suspected.\nThe true joy in this game comes not solely from the abilities you have, but in how the developers actually  encourage  you to abuse them. They have strategically placed optional "Super Secret" foxes in locations that are completely off the beaten path. For instance, in trying to break the game I ended up  climbing out of a hole in the ceiling of one level,  but the devs had anticipated me and I promptly found one of the golden foxes there. There is a fine line between clever secrets and arbitrary item-hiding. TRI manages to fall consistently into the former, making for a constantly surprising and wholly enjoyable experience.","December 3, 2014","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You do this by creating your own triangular-shaped platforms which allow you to walk on walls, bend or block light beams, and more to solve puzzles. The setting is like a dreamy addaptation of eastern temples where foxes are gods, and I like how triangles are used as eyecandy too.\n\nSome of the puzzles are very clever, while some others were initially vague about what they expect the player to do. Compare it to Portal for example, where the exit door is easely recognizable and players have to analyze the room through logic in order to find a way to open it. TRI however houses some puzzles that I had trouble finding logical groundwork in, which made me scout some areas for a long time only to find (part of) the solution by chance, which didn't feel so rewarding. The crate puzzles felt a bit 'game-y' and one time I thought the solution I found (strangely moving a crate to a different room) was a bug yet the developer said it was the right solution after all.\n\nOn the positive side though, most puzzles in this game felt refreshing and really something else. I liked the gravity shifting, light bending and Kami (little spirits moving in an angle instead of straight like light beams), and the crystals that activate new light switches. Some of the best puzzles were fairly compact yet completely optional as they only give an golden idol (little statues) for unlocking bonus content and achievements.\n\nIt took me about 23 hours to complete all chapters, but keep in mind that I got awkwardly stuck a lot in some of them and I tried to grab any Golden Idol that came to eyesight. The first-person controls might not be for anybody, but if you liked Portal (for the gameplay, not for the wits and memes), I'm sure you'll really appreciate TRI!","June 28, 2015","true","25.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It happens sometimes sure, but to resort to a full blown "get me through this entire level" type of thing? No. It shouldn't ever be that hard. I don't mind challenging - it makes it more satisfying in the end, but there's a huge line between hard and stupid. This level is stupid.\n- Level 15. I quit after the first puzzle. No, I quit during the first puzzle. It was obvious what to do, but doing it was incredibly annoying. After 14, I said no more.\n\ntl:dr\n- Most of the game is really fun and the puzzles are good.

The problem always seems to be right in front of you and usually if you don't solve it I noticed more often it's your fault and it can be solved by investigating It has it's moments where I felt like "Okay this needs to be a little polished at times" (For example there was a moment when an NPC got stuck in a spot for about 2 minutes because I was too close to them however the problem (while amusing as it was) resolved itself in about 3 minutes tops when I moved away from the NPC.) these small flaws didn't ruin the experience of what I have played as a whole.

I quit on the 11th level (out of 16) when I had to start ♥♥♥♥ing around with the direction of lasers. Way too clumsy. I see a lot of comparison to Portal and I can definitely understand it. But the portal mechanic was much neater. It's easy to imagine portals being a useful thing that could exist, but the triangle thing doesn't really fit into any comprehensible grounded narrative structure. In terms of gameplay it became kind of exhausting to get from A to B. It felt like the player was designing the level but not in a good way. I'm like "yeah I know I need to get there but I don't want to make like 10 triangles i.e. 30 points to get there. Portal involves all the planning but the actual execution is super neat.\n\nThe fox story and aesthetics were kind of enjoyable without necessarily being well-crafted. The music was super high quality though. Some of it was like late 90s Crash Bandicoot-y 3D platformer throw-back. Congo drums, kazoos, didgeridoos and tribal vocals and some synth. But it wasn't hugely memorable. Sound design was also very well done.\n\nI guess the best part was level design.
