Your goal in this one is to kill all the enemies in every stage and score the most points.\n\nThe game features a Stats option,by leveling up your character from killing aliens you gain point that you can than use to upgrade your character,increase his health,speed,armor,stength,and many more.You also unlock various perks that can help you trough the game.\n\nPROS:\n- Really good soundtracks (dubstep,electronic)\n- Character selection\n- Character upgrade system\n- Decent visuals\n- Nice artstyle\n- Greatly detailed stages,good lighting and colors\n- Voxel technology that makes everything destructible and adds a lot of particles\n- Decent number of weapon types\n- Decent number of enemies\n- Random drop system (xp multiplier,shied,weapons,and more)\n\nCONS:\n- Game can be a bit too hard as the levels go on\n- You need a pretty decent PC to run it,because the particle effects are demanding\n- Some enemies are going trough the walls in some stages\n\n(If i find any more downsides or anything to the game i'll update my review)\n\nP.S. The game has an early tech demo version over at Gamejolt if you want to try it out before buying it,it doesn't have a lot of the features that the full version has,but it's worth a try.\n\nConclusion:\nThe game is really fun,you can enjoy trying to beat your or other people's highscore,or just have fun destroying stuff,it's completely up to you.The game needs some tweaks here and there,but for the moment it's pretty good in my opinion.\nIf you are looking for a game with some good music in the background,and where you kill lots of enemies while the nice environment around you is slowly fading away from all that destrucion,than it's a game for you. :)\nIf you are deciding to buy it,have fun and game on. :D\n\nFinal Score: 9/10","February 27","true","6.0"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","18","18","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/recommended/339440/","orgelambart","Orge Lambart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/","5490 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNothing I enjoy more than having a nice relaxing evening playing a mindless twin stick shooter, plowing through waves of creatures, and building up that old school high score..  (brought back memories of my days plugging quarters into the arcade, trying to beat some over the top high score.)  When I first saw Critical Annihilation my first thought was this looks awesome..  After playing the game for a few hours I said yes, this game is awesome.  Voxel based games have really taken off the last few years...  While some may take issue with the art style and game play, I love it.\n\nGameplay -\n\nTypical twin stick shooter game play, (pretty sure they are still considered twin stick on the PC, anyway) the environment is billed as being totally destructible, which is great, but on almost all the levels you'll be too busy avoiding bullets, zombies, spiders and everything else the game throws at you... In all that mayhem, you'll likely forget all about the Environment being destructible.   From what I saw stuff got destroyed after a while, but this isn't a game about causing massive destruction, but about killing lots of enemies.  What sets Critical Annihilation apart from the other twin stickers out there....  along with the above-mentioned environment destruction, the game has some rpg elements as well, with various stats you can increase as you level up.  The game appears to have 3 classes which are unique from each other, Soldier, Engineer and Scout, each class has their own advantages and disadvantages..  The Soldier has the best base combat stats, but no regen or shields..   The Engineer has ok combat stats but starts with a high shield, the Scout has the weakest combat stats but starts off with high regen.\n\nThe stages are fairly large (they are contained to a large round play space), nice amount of room to kite them around (kiting is the act of running around in large circles while the enemies lump together allowing you to pick them off one by one) very common tactic in twin shooters.  Although you can employ the kiting tactic to get an advantage, it starts being far less effective the higher in levels you get.  The last stage I played had I could have sworn 50 - 60 enemies on it.  The difficult really ramps up, with each stage you finish.\n\nCA has 2 main game modes, Campaign, and Survival..   Campaign's and the survival modes are the same, with the major difference being, the campaign will eventually have you wiping out the enemies and facing a boss battle prior to moving onto the next area.   While survival is as you may have guessed trying to stay alive for as long as humanly possible... (After about 3 minutes or so survival seems to get very very hairy, and dare I say very fun.).  A third game mode is grayed out, being an early access title I'll make the leap this mode is currently being worked on, or I didn't finish the game far enough along to unlock it.\n\npro's\nFun and addictive game play\nDecent music,\nvery challenging,\nhigh intensity\n\ncon's\nsome minor glitches with enemies\noccasional hit detection failures\n\n[Summation]\nI'd recommend this fun title, have yourself some mindless fun, slaying all manners of creatures, level up your characters, chew bubblegum and kick butts.  Just remember when you fail (which you will) dust yourself off and try again.  Just remember, winners never quit!!!","March 15","true","5.3"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/339440/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2003 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCritical Annihilation is an isometric twin-stick shooter with a voxel graphic style. Not only the graphics are made out of voxels, but the game itself is based upon a voxel engine, thus allowing for destructible environments and some pretty good looking particle and lighting effects when there is an explosion. It is also worth noting that the can be somewhat demanding on your computer, especially during big explosions due to all the particles flying and the big craters that appear on the ground. That said, the game already has a very detailed options menu so if you run into trouble running the game, you can do some tweaking and it will most likely run fine.\n\nOne thing I must say is that I’m not really one to play much of these top down survival shooters. Still, I was atracted by its rather unique look and was surprised that I found myself enjoying the gameplay as much as I did.\n\nOne other thing that surprised me was the soundtrack. I’m not much of a listener to this type of electronic music (dubstep?) but I must say that after playing the game for a few hours, it started feeling quite catchy and it kind of grew on me.\n\nThe core:By looking at the game trailer and screenshots you can clearly guess what the game is all about, mowing down hordes of enemies. That said, I’m going to try to explain some other mechanics that the game has.\n\nFirst and foremost, you have three different modes, one of which is not available at the moment. You have your campaign mode, that currently has 15 different missions, which allows you to unlock powerups, perks, weapons and the specific mission maps for survival mode. Survival mode, as you probably imagined, is just survive as long as you can. Last but by no means least, “classic survival” mode, which is unavailable at the moment, is basically survival mode but with no powerups and you select your weapon at the beginning, atleast according to its description. As with any other game of this genre, Critical Annihilation also features online highscore leaderboards.\n\nNow, where the game gets interesting, atleast for me, is with the ability to choose different characters and improve them, unlock perks and different abilities. As of right now, you can choose between three different classes, Soldier, Engineer and Scout. Each one of them has their own ups and downs and you should try each one of them out and see which one better suits your playstyle. That said, the character progression is fast paced, every now and then you’ll be able to spend points to upgrade your stats (Life, Accuracy, Speed, Stamina, Regeneration and Shield). You’ll also be able to choose different perks and abilities for your current character.\n\nPerks are basically passive abilities, such as increased life regeneration and the ability to make enemy bullets move slower. Abilities on the other hand are divided into two categories, offensive and defensive abilities. While playing you can activate your offensive ability with “Q” and your defensive ability with “E”. Examples of offensive abilities are things such as a sentry turret or an airstrike, while defensive abilties can be something like a plasma shield that makes you invulnerable for a short period of time or the ability to slow down time.\n\nAfter killing them, some enemies will drop either weapons or powerups. Weapons range from your standard assault rifle, shotgun, laser pulse rifle, grenade launcher and minigun. The minigun particularly is really satisfying to use, since it completely obliterates waves of enemies. Powerups can be simple things such as medkits or life saving items such as nukes, turrets and rocket launchers. The nukes are my favourite because they cause a huge explosion and leave a hole on the ground.\n\nOne thing I also found out to be really helpful was the ability to jump, which is rather unusal for a game like this. Jumping allows you to shoot rockets above the enemies at the front so that the explosion hits the middle of a crowd, thus causing more casualties.\n\n\nVerdict:\nTo sum things up, I do have some minor things that I think need to be adressed. One is the fact that the game has no story whatsoever. This is not necessarily a bad thing for some people, especially people who are die hard fans of this genre, but others like myself might find this to be a negative point.\n\nOne other very slight complaint that I have is the fact that the the sprinting animation is very hard to distinguish from the standard move animation. I believe that having a different animation for sprinting would allow new players to distinguish the two a little bit better. Maybe I’m just nitpicking.\n\nStill, after looking at the forums, I can say that the developer is open and takes into consideration the ideas and suggestions given by the players and the community, so it wouldn’t surprise me if these small issues I have with the game would be adressed.\n\nIn the end, the game is pretty simple, and people looking for an in-depth shooter might not find that here. That said, this game is ideal for people who just want to have some mindless fun and have the satisfaction of shooting endless hordes of enemies in the face and, as I mentioned, the game has its fair share of perks, weapons and power ups, so if you’re into that sort of thing, I think you’ll find plenty of enjoyment here.","March 16","true","4.6"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

First it is nearly impossible past level 8 so needs some balancing. Crosshairs need to be visible. They are almost invisible. I cant stress that enough had no idea where the crosshairs were most of the game.  Would prefer the game wasnt at an angle  makes it very hard to target and walk with a keyboard but that may not be possible with their game design maybe make view angle optional? Other than those few frustrating and very fixable game design issues its really great. I love the voxel model destruction and it looks absolutely fantastic on 4k.

I highly recommend it.\n\nHowever there are some suggestions and tips how this game could get better. (Since its still early access and I just had some ideas, maybe theyre stupid, but hey you can just ignore them.)\n\nIdeas:\n\n1. I haven't completed the campain yet but I already wish there would be more levels. Maybe some more stages and/or Bosslevels after a Chapter.\n\n2. More characters. I dont now if you have to unlock some first but it would be cool if there were more options depending how you think you could survive best.\n\n3. A co - op mode would be very nice. Dont now if local is needed, but online has to be a thing.\n\nBugs?:\n\n1. Dont know if that is intented but some monsters just clip through the environment. And I checked, no, the obstacles were completly intact.\n\n2. When an enemie ( for example a dog) stands right infront of me, the bullets spawn behind him and do no damage, which is annoying when you are not fast enough to back off.\n\n3. Balance: The diffuculty is nice and balanced. The only thing bothering me are the special enemies with special guns, which make so much damage if you dont look out. Most of them are big enought to see, but some look very similar to the "normal" guys and get overlooked so easy. And the red bar doesnt realy help. Maybe make the similar looking ones just bigger or shinier? Would be very helpfull.

We take advantage of voxel technology to hype up the explosive gameplay. Everything is destructible to its core. As your home planet gets invaded by aliens you decide to take up arms with the rest of the planet and annihilate every single alien in site. As you progress in the game you'll bring yourself to whole new planets like the Moon and Mars until you've reached the aliens Mothership. Why exactly are these cliche aliens attacking your cliche planet in the good old fashion cliche way? It's for you to find out as you destroy every cube of their being.

A fast paced game, custimization of your character, and most of all, pretty much everything blows up exactly as I hoped it would.\nThe only thing I noticed while playing it is that sometimes your cursor gets a bit lost in the more intense moments as mobs of aliens and cyborgs surround you.\nIf they could add anything in, I'd love it if they had a feature to make the aiming cursor more visible, either by adding some kind of glow to it as it passes over an enemy, or maybe a button that can be assigned that makes it pop out with some kind of radar like effect to make if obvious that hey, on top of all the ♥♥♥ you're kicking, here's your mouse!\nOutside of that, this game is easily one of my favorites I've played, ever.","March 4","true","11.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Critical Annihilation only adds to the fun with more enemies, more destruction and more soon to come. I was skepticle to buy this game at first considering some other early access games I purchased were not as fun as I'd hoped, but this is an excelent acception.\n\nPros:\nThe world is very destructable\nPhysics are nice\nPowerups are amazing, esspecially the slow motion and explosion.\nThis game is definetly challenging\nGreat soundtrack\nfair veriety of maps\nAgain, the explosions can only be described as satisfying.\n\nCons:\nThe game gets difficult extremley fast, I mean level 4 fast.

The game itself is really well presented and polished up for the current state that it's in (Early Access), the art style of the game is really niceand the current amount of weapons is decent for the time being. It's very addicting to play and is insanely fun. It is worth noting that this game does demand for your computer to be decent, especially when it comes to destorying the enviroment with all of the explosions happening and big craters that are on the ground. If you are having troubles with performance issues of this game, then I suggest you do some changes in the opitions menu to make the game run smoothly.\n\nGameplayCritical Annihilation is a fast paced shoot 'em up with some really cool perks, and character progression. The game is strangely addiciting along with all of the enemies that you have to kill. The destructable enviroment of the game really fits well with all of the enemies that will be running at you trying to kill you. Although, when playing through the game, it seems that the game is really demanding for your computer to be decent. With all of the explosions happening when you pla through the game and craters that appear on the ground, make sure your specs of your computer are good enough to run this game decently. There is a rather large selection of weapons available up for use to kill your enemies with. Providing that there is also randomly generated drop system in this current stage of the game, it is really impressive to see that sort of detail be in the game already at this stage of the game that is currently in Early Access.\n\nArt StyleThe decent visuals and art style of this game really fit the type of game the developers made for this game. Most of the stages are very well detailed, with vibrant lighting and colours which really bring this game to life. The games graphics are made out of voxels, but upon doing some research of this game, it was also based upon the voxel engine which allows for the destructable enviroments that happen during the game. The lighting really comes into play when explosions happen throughout, the lighting is really well presented when exlpsions occur and that's when the lighting effect is best shown off.\n\nMusic & SoundGenerically, the sounds are very nicely done and presented when playing through the game. With the music in the background that really fits the fast paced shooter game, with a kind of dubstep music to it. The sounds of the guns and the enemies are fairly nice, not annoying like some game where they use the same sound effects for each gun.\n\nConclusionA very fun and addictive game to play, with some really nice graphics and explosions that occur through the game. Although it demands a bit on your PC, so make sure that your specs or up with the recommened specs. If you are having trouble then tweek some settings to make the game run smooth. Some really nice music to fit the fast paced type of game.\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Good Games Giveaways & Reviews curator group here.","March 18","true","0.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Way too difficult beyond ANY level of fun, with nothing but rage and frustration to be had here.  It's not "challenging", it's just plain ridiculous.  Oh sure, yeah, it looks good and has nice music and sound effects, but that's not enough to make a game.  It has to be reasonably playable too, which this is not unless you're a cyborg.

I recommend this game because the devs are active and updating, this is a pretty good sign for games like these.\n\nAnyways, I guess I should go over gameplay mechanics.\n\nGameplay Pros:\n\nIt's very chaotic, the amount of chaos is pretty amazing.\nIt has a lot of weapons, awesome that this engine can build weapons well.\nIt has a varity of enemies\nIt has a pretty good bullet hell dodging system\nAnd it has some good design all around.\n\nGameplay cons:\nNo multiplayer (Coming soon hopefully)\nNo screen Rotation\nAnd some abilities are missing.\n\nI can imagine this could turn out to be a pretty enjoyable arcade type game. As a personal hope from me, please keep it up devs. Don't be like 75% of the early access games on steam.\n\nHope my Review helped you out!","March 21","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But for me thats just great because i find it more satisfying to mow down the hordes of aliens than just winning. 10 Bucks for this kind of an early access game is, in my opinion, a bit high as people have pointed out. Though it seems that updates are pretty consistent so im certainly not going to refund it.

I can't think of a better way to describe it than in a pro's and con's list, So i'll keep it short and simple.\n\n\nPros\n- Absolutly beautiful graphics, There is something about voxel based graphics that makes me fall in love with a game.\n\n- Everything is destructable, With everything bieng made of small bricks, it creates a great enviornment for blowing things up and shooting every thing. There is nothing more satisfying than finishing a level and seeing the large craters in the ground accompanied with half a building.\n\n- Plenty of stuff to do, There are tons of levels to play, plenty of weapons to fight with, and plenty of enemies to fight, giving you enough explosions to last a lifetime.\n\n- Very customizable, When you enter the options menu, there is a large assortment of settings to change, for graphics, audio, and key bindings. If you don't have the best computer, you can still play this game with sustainable FPS.\n\n- BOOM BANG POW BUZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ BOOM EXPLOSIONS\n\n\nCons\n\n-Needs a little balancing on certain levels\n\n- Nope can't think of anthing else\n\n- BOOM EXPLOSIONS","May 29","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
