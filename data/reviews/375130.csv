Story is good, it seems that the decision you make really influence the plot, romance isn't taking too much of the script which is good since i hate when these things takes a too big part in game or films.\n\nIf you have a decent english level especially a decent vocabulary and a good reading comprehension you shouldn't have too much trouble to understand everything.\n\nThis reminds me of the great serie Deadwood. (watch it if you haven't yet)\n\nDo I recommend this game?

But this one is GOOD. FANTASTIC! The story really drew me in, especially the writing (which was fantastic) and it blew me away how your choices, big or small, can help or hinder you later on in the game. I was incredibly pleased with the character maker, you can be male or female, and choose from many difference ethnicities, and other characters within the game will actually react, negatively or positively to your choices.\n\nFor example, I was a Chinese woman, and many people were incredibly confused at how I rose to my position of power, and some even voiced these concerns, which is definitely realistic for the time period.\n\nAll of the companions you can aquire in the game are amazing too, each with their own, incredibly interesting backstories and abilities, and your companions can even help you train your skills!\n\nYou can choose to be good, bag, neutral or any crazy mix of the three. You can choose to be proficent at MANY different types of weapons, you can choose to be indimidating or persuasive or just plain out smart.\n\nThis game was REALLY good, 10/10, and I would definitely recommend this.

This is one of the two best interactive novels I've ever played (the other being Mecha Ace). the writing is solid, the characters are fun and endearing, and the choices have weight and consequence without feeling shoehorned in just to force you into having to make a weighty decision. Perhaps more importantly, a lot of choices are appropriately grey - it might be honorable to do something, but is it really best (for you or the community)? The only problem has been during a almost every violent encounter I died. There is usually very little hint as to which action is the best one (even if you'd think your character would know better, or could easily perform the feat). Luckily, if you die, you can just restart the encounter. It just costs you "Legend", which I guess is the games rating score. In spite of this, the game is just charming to play.\n\nSo why do I NOT recommend it? Because the ending doesn't make sense. This huge conspiracy is built up over the course of the game, only to lead to a sudden and unexpected confrontation (where you can cordially invite everyone and their parents [literally] as allies, even if you pist them off earlier in yoru adventure) with a learing plot hole. Namely, how does one family threaten the livelihood of America with a small band of outlaws? It's completely nonsensical, and when combined with the rushed ending, becomes disappointing.\n\nI would only recommend this game if you are willing to enjoy the journey and don't care (much) about the ending. It's the longest interactive novel I've ever played/read... and the most disappointing.","June 12, 2015","false","16.7"," 27 of 42 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","27","42","4","0"

My primary complaint about the game is that it offers too much individual freedom, to the point of departing from its premise.  What kind of Marshal blows up dams, robs wagons and shoots people under no provocation?  While many scenarios have diplomatic solutions, violence isn’t only a last resort.  In other words, I think the story might have been more convincing if the player had other careers to choose from, as opposed to being made a Marshal by default.\n\nThat being said, any fan of RPG’s should welcome Tin Star.  It’s constructed like a massive Western D&D campaign and is both one of the longest and most interactive titles by Choice of Games.  The challenges it offers are numerous and inventive, avoiding the grindy repetition typical of the RPG genre.\n","June 29, 2015","true","0.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

Very descriptive, and captures the imagination on an emboldened tale. The choices given are also pretty interesting. It's not so much as an A or B choice, but a great deal more. Minor spoilers here, about two chapters in, so skip the reminder of this paragraph if you don't want to spoil it. You encounter a cowboy, and a gold panner engaged in a shootout. You first choose how you want to arrive at the scene, and then engage with both characters. You can go in guns blazing, shooting before asking questions, or you can lend an ear to the two men and find out whats really going on. I got a chuckle out of this scene when I had the option to approach the men and, "Tip your hat and say, afternoon gents". You then find out whats going on, and effectively play detective. Listen to both sides of the story, figure out who is in the wrong or right, and then have one of the two pay reperations for what went wrong. Afterwards you can ask one, or both of the men to accompany you on your travels. Both characters are well written, and in the short time I've been with them, I actually feel like I'm friends with them(rather lame I know, but bare with me.)\n\nThe game also has a stat system, which is really interesting. Different options you select can have different effects on you. For example, in one section of the story I opted to travel with a ranchhand. He was on the frontier for a while, and offered up a good bit of knowledge on the wilds, and surviving harsh enviroments. As a result, my stats increased for those respective areas. In one section, im given a few days to launder about, and I can practice various things. I can take to target practice, read up on a variety of subjects, go gamble, etc. The stats effect different options, much like mass effect. You can upgrade persuasion, honor, and other traits. It's an interesting concept, and it makes your choice actually feel weighted.\n\nThis game, or novel, is hard to put down, and if you love westerns, and reading in general, you'll greatly enjoy it. Give it ago, it only costs a big mac, beef jerky, case of cheap beer, etc.","June 15, 2015","true","2.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Your choices effect how the story goes. Make one bad decision and you must stick with it throughout the story. Most choices don't effect at all, but some are very crucial to the story. Kill that person; bad choice, now everyone thinks you are a terrible person. Now lets get onto the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n+ 1,376,197 words long/80,000 words each time you play\n+ Be male/female and choose your race\n+ You can be straight/gay\n+ Stats to look at\n+ Very well written\n+ The game reacts whenever you made a positive/negative decision\n+ Realistic (I played as a chinese man and everyone gave me the third degree)\n\nCons:\n- You can't save the game. Only autosaves\n- Parts of the story seems out of place\n- You already know the names of the people you'll encounter by checking the stats at the beginning\n- When doing your own chores, nothing adds to the story\n\nIn Conclusion  Obviously, there are more pros than cons. Tin Star promised me what I would get when I play the game. From beginning to end, I felt like I was always part of the story. I made a bad choice? Now the game makes me feel like ♥♥♥♥.

At the end of the day, I was sad to have to put it down because I had come to enjoy Preston springs and its residents so much.  My only complaint is that there is no more content.  In terms of the focus of the story, I particularly enjoyed developing relationships with the characters, and the more role-playing aspect of the game.  It is also nice to see the western genre alive in the modern day, as I think that is a great genre and often underrepresented.

It is pretty cheesy and unless you do something foolish not really a challenge of course-being a novel (one which might stand for another editor's read through at that) but it is indeed dynamic and interesting for a spaghetti western choose-your-own-adventure.  You can play it through fully in one sitting-and for 3-5 bucks that isn't bad-but the content afforded you with various play styles or simple descisions makes for, as I said, an interesting and dynamic game.  Whether you're a female marshel interested in lezzing out and making money-or named James Dredd and crave only justice\n\nOverall: Very high replay value, continual branches of choice, high FPS and a very low price(/storage space need if you are someone who worries about that) eclipse the game's faults.\n\nI mean really it's a choose-your-own-adventure spaghetti-western with five to a couple dozen hours of content for three dollars.\n","June 14, 2015","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Persuade, create a deal or just shoot to kill many of the criminals you'll met. There's also turns to improve skills and sides stories between the main story leading to the telling of your legend and showing how you affected other characters at the end which is a cool feature, and there's a song too! (it's only lyrics but man it adds to the feel).\n\nThat being said, it is hard to even imagine the effort and hours put into this game. Kudos to the writer!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheJackHughman/recommended/375130/","TheJackHughman","Jack Hughman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheJackHughman/","191 products in account","Bought this on a whim. Wasn't sure what to expect, but was very pleasantly surprised.\n\nWhat you get is an entirely text based, 10 chapter story where you develop your character as a US Marshal in 19th century Nevada. After some introduction, you start each chapter in the hub of your town where you decide what to spend your limited time and very limited money on, and then something happens that needs a Marshal. The mission of each chapter has a nice variety, ranging from quiet investigations to big skirmishes, and the real selling point here is the choice it gives you on how to approach every thing in them. Generally after some investigating things get drastic and you have to make a series of choices based on your skills, knowledge, and character. With about 4 or 5 and sometimes 8 options for every bit, I never felt too pressured to do one thing or another. The amount of 'just shoot them' options make renegade Shepard look like a pacifist.\n\nBehind the all text is a very RPG like skill system measuring your abilities, alignment, and relationships. It never explicitly says that you fail or succeed at something due to these values as well as never explicitly says when they're checked like in Fallout, only when they increased. I liked this, it gave some immersion and made me think about what the Marshal could do, rather than what numbers said he could do. I rolled a Lawful Good persuasion gunslinger and when I did those types of things, they worked, but when I tried to build something or wrestling a bear, I was up a creek.\n\nThe story gradually built up, with the connections between the chapters being revealed more towards the end. The final ending I got was a little boring, I really just went up to someone, arrested him, and that was it. I probably could have gotten something more interesting if I decided to do more shooting and less talking, and it didn't help there was a weird period of nothing between big action finale and the actual ending of the story. However you do get a full rundown of how your choices made a difference and the ultimate fate of your town and the cast that does give closure.\n\nMechanistically, the text engine used is bare bones looking, but works fine. Conversations are in a layout that should be recognizable to anyone whose played Mass Effect but much more concise, and the 'asking for information' prompts differentiable from 'threaten and shoot them in the face'. I wish they gave it an interface little flavor though, sometimes it felt like I was just taking a really exciting customer service survey.  Some say there's some poor grammar, but unless your an English major this probably won't bother you alot, I never noticed. If, for example, you were just bothered by 'alot', it might be an issue.\n\nOne note: There is permadeath, but only if you 'accept' the fatal mistake. You lose a cosmetic point at the end of the game, but that's it. Additionally, you can save and reload at the end of chapters. Progess is save automatically.\n\nI got 6 hours out of one playthrough, asking every question possible and restarting a chapter a few times to get a better ending. I'd expect another run would be shorter with reading less background, and probably it would take about 4 playthroughs total to see the outcome of most things major. That's quite a bit of game for $5, if you don't mind reading it.\n\n\n\ntl;dr: A very intense customer service survey set in 19th century Nevada about making good choices.","June 9, 2015","true","1.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Over time you really begin to appreciate the amount of work that has been put into this game and the possibly slightly metaphorical flowchart that must've been created when designing this game. I really enjoy how the game keeps track of your skills and provides sensible, but not restricted choices of action when it comes to usual, western troubling situations. The way you choose your weapon, and determine your past via multiple choices really finishes this game for me. If you're a fan of D&D sessions but ones which involve a hefty amount of skills, then purchase this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/recommended/375130/","dpxmsk","DeadPoolX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/","1183 products in account","You don't see very many games set in the Old West, so when one comes along, it's a novelty.\n\nTin Star is a Text Adventure, although not in the same sense as Zork, Moonmist, Planetfall, etc. In those games you actually had to type out commands to interact with the world, whereas Tin Star has pre-defined choices. You often get a bunch of options to choose from, but even so, you're still limited to whatever the author programmed.\n\nIn this sense, Tin Star resembles the Choose Your Own Adventure book series, which ran from 1979 to 1998. Anyone who grew up in the 1980s and early 1990s likely spent hours with different CYOA novels. I know I did.\n\nThe story of Tin Star follows a man or a woman (you can select your gender, name, and sexual orientation) who was saved from execution via hanging and made the sheriff of a small town. During the game, you get to meet all sorts of individuals, many of whom can be either friend or foe depending on how you interact with them.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't delve too much into the story without ruining it, but I can say that there were a number of plot twists. Unlike some AAA titles that advertise "your choices will matter," Tin Star actually makes good on that promise.\n\nThere are no graphics, music or sound effects of any kind. This means you'll have to use your imagination to conjure up the imagery, but given that the author provides plenty of information, that's not too difficult.\n\nOne minor benefit to a total lack of audio is that you can easily play your own music in the background without it interrupting anything or being interrupted by the game's music/sound effects.\n\nThe system requirements are so low that even a PC that's over a decade old could run Tin Star. So if you have an older machine or an underpowered laptop, rest assured you won't have any problems here.\n\nI do have a few "issues" with the game, however.\n\n1. The visuals consist of black text on an off-white background. While that's a fine setup, it'd be nice if the player could choose their own text and background colors. I know some people prefer using a dark background and lighter text, especially if they're playing in a dimly-lit room.\n\n2. As far as I can tell, Tin Star only saves your game at the end of each chapter, and only then if you tell it to do so. This is because you can replay the chapter if you want to try something different, which is nice, but it also means you have to start that chapter over at the beginning.\n\n3. There's only one save file. If you start a new game, your old save will be written over. So if someone else in your household wants to play Tin Star, make sure you back up your save or that they have their own Steam account and use family sharing.\n\nBottom line: It won't win any awards for being flashy or technologically impressive, but what it does have is a good interactive story with meaningful choices and interesting characters. I'd recommend Tin Star, especially considering it's only $4.99 USD.","February 1","true","10.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

You get some choice in who your character is, but it feels like the game is pushing you to be some sort of doctor-lawyer hybrid. You start the game ready to be hanged for a crime you did or did not commit (it's up to you), and instead of dying you end up in a secret room where someone decides to make you a marshal and set you free to bring law to the land.

You want a wild west romance novel where your lover has two revolvers trained on your enemies when you're in danger?

What intrigued me about this title was it's epic length, and that it sounded interesting in that you take on the role of a US Marshall on the Old West frontier. There's not a lot specifically about the story that I can say that will not be full of spoilers, so I will refrain; however, this is one incredibly well-done story, full of far-reaching choices. You can be a dastardly, terribly corrupt lawman, or be a paragon of virtue. The ending Epilogue pretty much shines a light on everything you did during the game, and tells you of the far-reaching consequences as a result.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like is the numerous typos ("their" instead of "they're," "peaked" instead of "piqued," and several others); this was especially the case in the latter half of the game. Maybe it's not that big a deal, but if a game is going to be presented in a written medium, it really should be super-tight when it comes to editing and proofreading. Still, a commendable effort if several were caught in the making, as the author thanks numerous people for doing so. I would have loved to have helped proofread this to catch the dozens that I did see while going through it.\n\nStill, none of that is a big deal. I felt an emotional bond to the character, felt some stirrings in the legacy I left behind, and truly enjoyed every moment. I especially liked that it was a long one! Seven hours is quite long for an interactive fiction game, and the author should be commended for his efforts, as well as Choice of Games for publishing this.\n\nI highly recommend this one, and I hardly ever review games on Steam.","July 16, 2015","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's easily my favorite game I've ever played on a mobile device, and in my top 10 favorite games on any platform.  It has an excellent story, a fully developed world to explore, interesting characters, and very broad flexibility about who you want your Marshal to be and how you want to resolve problems.

An epilogue for every cast, even minor ones! Awesome!\n\nThe bad:\n- Immersive world. Had to google some things as I did not know what they were.\n- Ending at finding out who the mastermind was is too simple.\n\nThe hopeful:\n- I want a sequel!

It has romance, action, mystery and the Wild west. Many of the choice actually did matter and the game rewards you for taking your time (talking to everyone, exploring options etc), but didn't always reward heroics. I think it gave the story a bit of realism, which helped, me at least, getting into the story. I also enjoyed the personalities of the characters in this story, even though some of them were slightly cliche.

An all without graphics, or sound! That really says something. To tell the truth, i hadn't played an interactive novels before this one, and from now on, i'm comparing every one that i DO play to Tin Star, why? because of the narrative, that's why. In an interactive novel such as this one, especially without graphics or sound, you have to hold the players attention in some way. If you don't, than you've failed a designing the game. However, Tin Star had me hooked all the way from the begining to the end. The writer, Allen Gies has immense talent for writing, and i commend his work. The style in which he delivers each new situation is always engaging, though sometimes feels a bit forced. And with that, let's get into the very few flaws of the game. First of all, the characters. Now, don't get me wrong, I loved the characters in Tin Star. They were very well writen and had diversity, but, their character buildup is very steriotypical. For instance, you've got the stoic cowboy, the renegade gunslinger, the eccentric prospecter, etc. However, like i said before, the way in which they were written makes up for it. The spelling could use some correction, but that's just more nitpicking than anything. And lastly, the ending. The ending feels really forced, and afterwards, you are presented with a lengthey epilouge that tell you what your character did after the ending, instead of letting you play it yourself. I can understand this for the other characters, but for the protagonist, it doesn't make sense to me. One of the negatives to having a simple, white canvas to write a story on is that your eyes start to get annoyed if you look at it for too long. Tin Star has the same problem. When i'm playing a game, i want to be told an engaging and thrilling story. Not be blinded. People with sensetive eyes will not enjoy the experience. I suggest switching to a more eye-freindly backdrop like dark blue, or something. Unfortunatley, ther's no way to change this yourself. And those are really all the negatives. Most of them are really nit-picky things, but negatives nonetheless. Every game has them. All in all, I really reccomend that you try this game. Especially if you want to be told an engaging story with many branching paths. I will definetly be trying more CYOA games, and Zombie Exodus is next!","April 19","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

An all without graphics, or sound! That really says something. To tell the truth, i hadn't played an interactive novels before this one, and from now on, i'm comparing every one that i DO play to Tin Star, why? because of the narrative, that's why. In an interactive novel such as this one, especially without graphics or sound, you have to hold the players attention in some way. If you don't, than you've failed a designing the game. However, Tin Star had me hooked all the way from the begining to the end. The writer, Allen Gies has immense talent for writing, and i commend his work. The style in which he delivers each new situation is always engaging, though sometimes feels a bit forced. And with that, let's get into the very few flaws of the game. First of all, the characters. Now, don't get me wrong, I loved the characters in Tin Star. They were very well writen and had diversity, but, their character buildup is very steriotypical. For instance, you've got the stoic cowboy, the renegade gunslinger, the eccentric prospecter, etc. However, like i said before, the way in which they were written makes up for it. The spelling could use some correction, but that's just more nitpicking than anything. And lastly, the ending. The ending feels really forced, and afterwards, you are presented with a lengthey epilouge that tell you what your character did after the ending, instead of letting you play it yourself. I can understand this for the other characters, but for the protagonist, it doesn't make sense to me.

When i'm playing a game, i want to be told an engaging and thrilling story. Not be blinded. People with sensetive eyes will not enjoy the experience. I suggest switching to a more eye-freindly backdrop like dark blue, or something. Unfortunatley, ther's no way to change this yourself. And those are really all the negatives.
