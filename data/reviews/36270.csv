The levels are platform and ladder puzzles where you rescue barely visible cats and collect microscopic ribbons.  You can dig holes, climb ladders and fall off platforms, but can't jump.  Not that any of this matters since, like Super Granny, you can't see a damn thing.","January 29, 2012","false",""," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","77","27","35","16","0"

This game is (to me) is mostly nostalgia, being why I bought it. But now onto why I was fond of this series from the beginning:\n-It is very original, and is more of a "lol" than a "chessy"\n-The level design is unique, and every level is different (some require some thinking, some are just "run and gun" with a frying pan or something similar\n-In the game's menu (all titles in this collection have this) is a level designer, the same used by the developer who was in charge building these unique levels (each title has at least 120 levels)\n-This "Level Editor" offers you the exact same functions the developer had; no disadvantages\n-It can be fun and slightly addicting (what I do is play a number of levels of one title, then move on to the next title and so on\n\nI hope this review was helpful to an extent, and I learned yesterday (if I recall correctly) that the company that made this franchise is defunct and has been since 2012 which means this is "as is" and "will be". I like this franchise.","March 28, 2015","true","14.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

Yet, there's some good old school gameplay to be found in these, and with hundreds of stages they aren't a quick beat. Plus, it has freaking kitties. Kitties. How can you not like kitties, you heathen?","December 27, 2011","true","17.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","89","8","9","8","0"
