There is a good handful, but by no means are there many compared to other similar genres.  This is a pretty great game if you are a huge fan of the genre in search of new games to try.  If you aren't that big of a fan of the genre, then this may not be a good game for you.  The thing is: this game is technically a parody RPG, and lacks depth in many areas.  However, ironically, it still winds up being a pretty good game in the genre it is trying to parody, even though it is simple and minimalistic.\n\nYou need to go into the game understanding it's supposed to be simple and whimsical, and then you can enjoy it for what it is.\n\nGrotesque Tactics: Evil Heroes doesn't have very much depth in the departments of tactics or RPG elements, which many other games in the genre do have.  Each character is a set "class" and only learns 2 "spells."  And there is only really one set of weapons/armor for each character that you acquire through the game.  The story is linear and there are no choices. And since all the characters have a set class with set abilities, it takes a lot of the tactical aspects of party formation out of the game; but you still have to plan your actions on the battle-grid accordingly. So there are still some tactical decisions to be made, just far less than is typical in the genre. But even with this lack of depth, the game is still charming in its own right.\n\nThe characters and narrative progression are purposefully cliché and it works out in a charming way.  And the graphics and soundscape are fitting with the game; nothing jaw dropping but nothing jarring. The result is an overall presentation that is sarcastically atmospheric and endearingly casual.\n\nSo even though this game is just a "parody," and therefor is simplistic compared to others in the genre— it is a welcome addition to a small list of games to a true fan of an amazing genre. The game is just fun, simply, especially to a fan of the genre itching for a novel experience.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","October 11, 2014","true","13.8"," 80 of 90 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","80","90","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lockeslylcrit/recommended/46450/","lockeslylcrit","Lockesly L'Crit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lockeslylcrit/","393 products in account","Grotesque Tactics, developed by an indie German studio by the name of Silent Dreams in a joint venture with Headup Games, is a turn-based strategy game in the same vein as Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre, or any of the other hundreds of games with "Tactics" tacked on to the title. But let me clear the air here: unlike the aforementioned games, Grotesque Tactics is bad. Not "bad" as in Big Rigs: Over The Road Racing bad, but more like "all I wanted for Christmas was a Nintendo 3DS but all I got was a Nokia N-Gage" type of bad. You know, the type of disappointment you get when you are hyped up on all the good things, but are let down on every level.\n\nThe plot is nothing to write home about. There are no plot twists, no overly-emotional scenes, nothing. Just you and your party against an evil empire. You play Drake, a drop-out from the Glory Military Academy. By a stroke of luck, the very fact that you were the only dropout in the history of the academy has saved you from death in battle at the hands of the Dark Church (the aforementioned evil empire). Being mopey and emo (and yes, the game makes use of "emo" way too much), Drake finds the courage to fight back against the Dark Church with the help of the Semidivine Holy Avatar, the stereotypical "I'm better than you, and women love me" beefcake of the game. Together, you and Holy scour the world rescuing maidens, recruiting party members, and completing side-quests. Like I said before, it's nothing to write home about.\n\nOn that note, I should mention the writing. I'm guessing Silent Dreams hired a 16-year old high-school dropout to translate the game for them, because even though the game has had an extensive grammar overhaul for the English version, the writing would make even a first-year college student cringe in terror. Grammar and spelling mistakes abound, and any hint of humor the game wanted to convey has been lost due to the horrid translation. For example, Candy, one of the three maidens you rescue and recruit, constantly says "Hihihihihi" instead of "Hehehehehe" or *giggles*. The only thing that would make that worse is if Navi from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was put in the game and constantly said "HEY! LISTEN!" every ten seconds. But even then I would have fond flashbacks to my time playing an infinitely-better game. Grotesque Tactics just makes me want to punch babies.\n\nAnd then there's the humor. I'd like it to be known that humor is NOT universal; it is purely subjective. Unfortunately, the game is billed as a parody of other great games. If anything, Grotesque Tactics is a parody of computer game designing. There is a difference between parodying a game and simply referencing a game, and Grotesque Tactics references the hell out of other games. The humor is extremely in-your-face, much like playing an interactive version of the Meet The Spartans movie. While it's not as ham-fisted as UnEpic, at least UnEpic is a good game.\n\nThe entire cast is a tragedy upon game design. The main character is an emo who isn't really emo all that much except in certain combat situations, the supporting character is the stereotypical knight-in-shining-armor with sunglasses, the rogue is a goblin who joins you because you killed his buddies, and various other travesties. Oh, and if any reader of this review is black and you want to see how German game developers portray black people, play this game. The only way the token black dude could get more stereotypical is if he had fried chicken in one hand and purple drank in the other. Yes, this is what Silent Dreams considers a parody. Sad, is it not?\n\nFrom the moment you boot up the game, you can already tell you're in for a world of hurt. The pre-game loading screen features Holy Avatar and the three maidens, but the whole thing looks like it was made in Poser. Then the game starts and the Poser-like art is replaced by anime character portraits. Holy is pretty much the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the group, while the three maidens and other female characters are in various states of undress. Let's not forget that while you are rescuing said maidens to recruit them, they are screaming about getting their clothes torn off. The character interaction, combined with the almost-ecchi artwork makes me believe that this game is the lead designer's attempt at a VERY bad self-insert fanfiction rather than a clever satire of RPGs.\n\nAnd finally we come to the meat and potatos of the game: the gameplay. As I've said before, it's a clone of the various Tactics games you see or have seen on the market. Turned-based strategy on a battlefield with positioning. Nothing new, so let's move into what makes Grotesque Tactics stand out from the crowd (other than the sad attempt at German humor).\n\nThe really big thing about the game is the Obsession system. The game flat-out tells you in the tutorial that this is a limit break (I'm guessing Silent Dreams' thought process was "LOLOLOLOL! I MADE A FINAL FANTASY 7 REFERENCE! LAUGH, PEONS! LOLOLOLOL!"). Each character has their own way of increasing their Obsession, from hitting stuff (Drake) to getting hit (EVERY SINGLE PARTY MEMBER). Each Obsession does their own unique thing, but more often than not it involves the obsessed party member attacking another party member. West goes berserk, attacking anything in range (friendly or not), the maidens and the angel simply attack a party member, the goblin rogue blinds everyone in a radius (again, no thoughts to friendly fire) and warps to Holy, and Drake buffs nearby party members' attack rating but at the cost of halving his attack rating a few turns afterwards. Drake is obviously the most benefitial of the party, but that's not saying much considering everyone else is geared toward screwing you over.\n\nInside combat, you control all characters in order based on their agility. Outside of combat, however, you can only control Drake while the others automatically follow him. This works out fine, except for one major game-breaking bug that was the straw that broke the camel's back for me: Afflictions aren't removed once combat is over. In the battle leading up to getting the mage party member, West went berserk due to his Obsession. I ended combat right next to a treasure chest in a narrow 1x1 area in the forest with West blocking the only exit in or out. Since he was technically still berserk, he refused to move, and I cant move through party members. Needless to say, I was stuck and had to reload the entire damn mission. Have I told you yet how much I hate this game?\n\nAnd lastly, I come to the deal breaker: the camera. Or, rather, the automatic camera panning. Any time there is dialogue or a character is moving, the camera will pan to that character. This isn't such a big deal if the damn thing would actually CENTER on said character. Instead, it trails behind a moving character. Trying to manually compensate for this means your camera goes out of whack and ends up 50 feet in some random direction. Again, this wouldn't be such a big deal if we could turn automatic camera panning off, or if movement outside of combat wasn't in real time. Alas, no on both accounts. This will, more often than not, lead to clicking the wrong square or giving you a fit of nauseua.","November 10, 2014","false","4.9"," 126 of 180 people (70%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","70","126","180","18","8"

I believe they could have polished it up more, but it wasn’t bad where I would quit a game on graphics alone.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-UI could use some polish.\n-Controls at times may feel wonky when moving the character at the same time when moving the camera (The game tries to pull you towards the hero when you’re trying to scout ahead of your movements).\n-A linear storyline\n-Not a lot of RPG elements (not a lot of spells, certain amount of armor/weapons, no manual stat gains – done automatically).\n\n\n\nThe game is supposed to be a fun, goofy experience about a hero that is to save the kingdom from an evil sect. Sounds like your typical storyline for a RPG, right? Well… it is! I believe you could call it a parody to other TRPGs out there and they’re doing it in their own fun way (which I approve). The bantering between certain party members and towards you is comical (I’ve had my outbursts of laughs, not going to lie).\n\nThe game isn’t to be taken seriously. If you are jumping into to this game and hoping for a serious TRPG, well, you might be disappointed and rant with a negative review on why this isn’t your cup of Joe. If you come in here knowing that this is a parody to other TRPGs, have a sense of humor, wanting to find humor in a title, then this game should fill your shoes.\n\nThe battles aren’t rememberable, but they do the job. At times you may even question the actions of your party members and throw a rant at your monitor, but that is perfectly normal.  I’ve had my fair share with the ditzes and a directional figure. I’ve also had the occasional crash, but it didn’t happen till after a 5 hour or longer gameplay session; I’m assuming a very slow memory leak…? If you save often then this issue won’t be an issue – besides, who doesn’t save often on a RPG anyways?\n\nOverall, this was a nice game to stumble onto and I find the humor and cliché moments very well done. I don’t see a lot of TRPGs and if you’re trying to find one yourself, I would recommend buying this one when you can!","October 5, 2015","true","17.7"," 42 of 50 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","42","50","2","0"

The over the top parody involving a self-loathing hero, a self-adoring tag-along who thinks he is a stereotypical babe magnet and is in fact a stereotypical babe magnet, and a plethora of stereotypical babes sounds like a real winner. Trouble is, this parody tries to push every aspect of the game and genre only to feel as if it is a parody of itself when jokes fall flat or are taken far enough to no longer be funny. Meanwhile the gameplay is hindered by poor camera positioning and a system where battles drag on well beyond the point of enjoyment.\n\nThe general ideas and foundation of the game are solid enough, but the execution leaves me underwhelmed. If you are not a strategy RPG fan, this game really has nothing to offer. Otherwise, it comes down to a matter of personal taste.","January 10, 2014","false","1.1"," 70 of 100 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","70","100","0","0"

Based on those reviews you've either decided this game interests you or it doesn't.  For anyone still considering Grotesque Tactics: Evil Heroes, let my tell you why I would recommend it.\n\nWhat I appreciate about this game is it's casual nature.  Sure, I like games that provide a challenge, but every now and then I want something a bit more simple and less challenging, for example, something to play during lunch break.  The turn based aspect of this game, by its nature, means I can take my time to plan out my moves without penalty.  In normal difficulty the combat is just difficult enough to require that I think about what I am doing, but not so difficult that my party is constantly wiped.  Additionally, the game's generous resurrection mechanic means I don't have to be concerned if any of my party (except for one or two key members) are "killed" in battle.  While not super challenging, this does keep the story progressing and I find that important when my time is limited and I don't want to be fighting the same battle over and over again just to get to the next stage of the game.\n\nEquipment is also simplified.  There is only one type of weapon or armor for each class and whenever you buy/find a new piece, it is obvious if it is better, equivalent or worse than what you already own.  This may sound boring to min/max'ers, but is a welcome feature for those of us who want a nice, casual experience without a lot of complicated formulas.  Overall, Grotesque Tactics: Evil Heroes is a fun, entertaining game if you are looking for something that doesn't require a lot of deep, concentrated thought and doesn't expect to be taken too seriously.","June 27, 2014","true","16.2"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

All the armor and weapons you come across will be direct upgrades. And the various items you get were mostly unnessessary.\n\nEvery character on your team is a double edged sword. Each is a timebomb. Once a specific requirement is filled for each of them they go off and hurt anyone nearby. The key is to be aware of this waiting until their fuse has almost ended and position them so that they'll help you and hurt your enemies.\n\nIt's very similar to Vandal Hearts of the PSX in that every character has a unique function and you always have your entire group with you at all times, All the equipment will always be direct upgrades, and there are no skill points or classes to allocate. It also lacks Vandal Hearts triangle combat system no weapon type has any advantage over any other.\n\nIf you enjoy tactical RPG's and Vandal Hearts especially you may enjoy this aswell. It won't be the best Tactical RPG you've ever played but it's still a decent game in it's own right.","June 1, 2014","true","34.3"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Grotesques are generally intended to be humorous."\n\nYou know?  This is excatly what I needed to know before jumping into this game.  It's dated, it has major flaws, the art is meh most of the time and the few characters I do like don't get developed as much as I would hope for...  But it was indeed a fun game.  Fustrating at times, but fun when a battle that seemed unwinnable turned around at the final moment due to a crit or a close miss.  As the game suggest, your party is made up of anti-heros: as in, these guys don't know how to work together.  But even so, somehow it all works out in the end.

The game is pretty funny at times and even smartly gives refences to other RPG style games. One I noticed was Shining Force. However sometimes the game is a little too predictable when it comes to the jokes, it's very cliche' and sometimes tries a little too hard. Now onto the gameplay, I have to say I quite like the style of gameplay however I sometimes find myself getting mad at the flow of the movement, there are quite a lot of invisible walls that could easily be walked on yet the game ignores. I noticed this greatly on a beautifully designed level which had a bridge connect to an island with a house on, I was hoping they'd hidden a chest on there but when you get to the bridge you can't walk across it. This of course is only a minor fault and more one of my irks with the game. I've also encoutered several bugs on the level I described with the bridge. One of them was a bug with the Angel character who was stuck in the same place throughout all the fights and exploration of the map. Of course this was a huge pain since she's the only healer so I instead had to use up most of my potions. On the same level as I got to the prison tower one of the female chocobirds glitched and repeatedly attacked all of my characters even after my main hero died. This happened twice but luckily the game didn't make me restart the level and instead fixed itself.\nNow onto the story. I have to say the story is quite enjoyable so far however some of the characters can be a bit unlikable, for example the maidens who constantly try to get the attention of Holy. I know they're going for the whole typical female stereotype within games but it can get a bit tiresome and it can be incredibly annoying in combat (If you decide to play the game you'll see what I mean).  However where there are a few downs there are ups, the rest of the characters I've encountered so far are very enjoyable in particular Drake and Holy who you start the game with. They are very much opposites. Drake is represented as a depressed emo type who doesn't have a lot of confidence whereas Holy is represented as a strong blonde hero who's sometimes vain. I could write more on the story but I've wrote enough already.\n\nOverall in my opinion this is a brilliant game for those people who love RPG style games with a hint of comedy. If you're not a fan of games putting obsticals in places where you could roam then this game will probably annoy you. You may find the combat later on in the game irksome as well as you find more characters as they have certain 'limit breaks' that can hurt people in your team and sometimes kill them. Don't expect anything too great since this is made by an indie team but it will be enjoyable none-the-less. Also the price is good for what's in the game so even if you're a little unsure it won't be too much to waste or you could just wait till the sale. Hope my review was useful.","March 22, 2015","true","7.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It starts out with the main character being a emo who was the only one ever to fail at the commander achademy and attempt to sacrifice himself until a Paladin names the "Holy Avatar" comes to your aid and inspires you to fight against the forces of darkness.\n\nLike Deathspank, this game has tongue-in-cheek humour at fantasy styled RPGs and MMOs with some silly enemies that'll bring a smile to your face such as savage mushrooms and sabre-toothed bunnies. There are even green mushrooms that when killed you hear the maro 1hp trune play and even see a 1hp appear.\n\nAll character have unique abilities and you have to think tactically in order to fight back and cut down the enemy.

Its combat uses the similar grid system, however nothing is even remotely complicated. The Terrain offers slight defense bonuses, there is no class changing and theres really no decision to be made on equipment.\n\nThe game does however offer an odd humor that I came to enjoy. Grotesque Tactics manages to poke fun at the overall genre of adventure games and seems to just have fun with itself without ever trying to become too "serious".\n\n\nTLDR~ Simple Final Fantasy Tactics game, has some decent humor in it, but makes fun of itself quite a bit to the point where I wouldn't recommend this to people who NEED a strong story to love a game.

There are many times where luck is valued more than skill, so regular saves are a must.\n\nI still have fun with these titles, but only in small bursts.

The extras are repeating parts of the game because of random crashes, horrible slowdowns (my computer meets the requirements comfortably and yet the game slows down to 3-5 FPS (!) in explore mode, even with lowest video settings.\n\nThe camera is sometimes non-responsive and often annoying in its movement and positioning. The character movement is terrible as well, on multiple occasions I've had problem pathing from like 5 squares to an NPC I had to talk to (during 1.5 h of playtime!).\n\nThe interface is designed in a weird and non-intuitive way. LMB for attack? Nah it's for selection, RMB for execution. Esc to exit an inventory/option menu? Naaah, let's limit that to the [X] closing button, Esc just slaps the main menu over it. Oh, and if you try to start a new game then, the old menu persists on the screen. I couldn't check if it happens when you load a game with a menu open, because the only time I could load a game was after a fresh start, otherwise it crashed.\n\nI wanted to like the game for being something different, but the end result will probably go into my "garbage" category, never to see the light of day again.\n\n\nOh, and if you want a good fantasy/RPG parody, try Unepic, that one's actually well-made.","September 17, 2014","false","6.1"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/h2o2/recommended/46450/","h2o2","Dihy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/h2o2/","1051 products in account","I own about 95% of the Meridian 4 catalog, and picked up GT: Evil Heroes during that package. I later purchased GT2: Dungeons and Donuts during a sale.\nThe Background\n\nGT1 and GT2 share the premise of the player taking control of a moody sap (Drake) who overcomes personal challenges to become The Hero That Saves The World. The game is largely a parody of main-stream RPGs, with characters often throwing out asides and references to other games. The jokes are campy and are mostly of low-brow humor; some would say the designers are mocking how sexualized female characters are in other games, some would say the designers are part of the problem.\nCharacters\n\nThroughout the games, you get the opportunity to recruit new party members with different skillsets, for example:\nAngelina: Healer\n"The Semi-Divine Holy Avatar Himself": 2 handed swordsman.\nCandy: Archer\nEach character has a relatively well fleshed out back story, as there is a LOT of dialogue to read. In GT2 they have actual voice actors to play each character.\nSkills\n\nIn GT1, skills are tied to your player level. Your character has an additional skill titled "Obsession", which is kind of an automatic passive attack with unique abilities.\nEx: Holy Avatar's obsession is the ability to talk everyone everyone to sleep in a 3x3 radius. Including your party members.\nIn GT2, skills are tied to your "Talent Tree" (which is not very well explained).\nWhen you max a bottom tier Talent, it unlocks your 3rd skill. A second tier talent unlocks your 4th skill, and a 5th tier talent unlocks your "ultimate".\nAdditionally, GT2 skills have a timer, so you can't use them every turn. Your Obsession meter (more like an ultimate meter), builds up to allow you to cast the Ultimate skill.\nThe ultimate skills in GT2 are actually pretty useful, with one of them doing massive AOE damage which is needed later in the game when there are seriously 20 monsters in a room.\nThe Problems\n\nThe camera is terrible. It frequently locks onto random locations, and you have to reset the Follow toggle to return to your character. You might even feel sick from it. The Bloom doesn't help either, and may be part of the problem in inducing motion sickness in players. There is extreme camera smoothing in both games.\nCharacters frequently get stuck. If I have a party member that stands in a doorway, and I try to talk to a NPC outside of that door way, I cannot pass through. My character will choose to run into the party member, and constantly try to move past. The controls are locked and I cannot disable the "queuing" of the talk command. To fix this I had to use the cheat console to teleport Drake to the NPC. This happened at least 30 or 40 times.\nIn GT1 there is a major gamebreaking glitch where the Holy Avatar would be completely disabled during a battle. The battle round timer would still be enabled, and you would be stuck in an infinite loop. This required a reload of an earlier save file to fix.\nIn GT2 the quest journal offers only Italicized and Normal text views. It is unclear if a quest is Completed, In Progress, or Not Completable. That last detail is interesting, there are at least 5 quests in GT2 that if completed, disable your ability to complete other quests. Some of my quests that were "completed" still remained in the journal, while some that were incomplete just disappeared.\nGT2 lacks progression logic. Finding your next mission requires you to talk to just about every NPC to figure out what you're doing next. The need to do so is not tracked in the quest log. There is also no notification that informs you to talk to a NPC. If you surf the Steam or Gamefaqs forums, many players ask "WTH do I do next?" And the answer is usually "Talk to everyone". This was not as big of a problem in GT1 as the maps were not as large.\nFinal Comments\n\nI eventually used the cheats "goto//god//healall" to complete both games. "Healall" resets the movement tracker so you can move from one end of a map to the opposite end in one turn. This made progressing through the (really boring and tedious) fights much quicker. Even then, it still took about 10 hours to finish GT2 because of all the walking and talking you're required to do. I would estimate that GT2 would take over 30 hours without cheating. And let me tell you the 10 second ending is not worth the effort[1] .\nHumblebrag: This post here is more comprehensive than anything you'll find online. Nobody wants to write a walkthrough or a guide for these games because GT sucks. If you're stuck on a mission/quest, leave a post and I'll see if I remember how I did it.","January 2","false","8.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

As you progress, you build a party of characters to take on the Dark Church, the generic evil organization in the world of Grotesque.  The game is fairly well written with decent humor and its own set of purposefully cliched characters, but it unfortunately has a lot of problems.\n\nThough the game isn't even 10 hours long, I had quite a few instances where a quest script broke or the AI got stuck in an infinite loop during combat, forcing me to reload my previous game.  One time a quest NPC accidentally got put to sleep during combat and since effects don't wear off while out of combat, I couldn't wake him up to continue.\n\nCombat can be rather unbalanced at times, with some enemies possessing instant kill attacks and others able to hit for nearly half a character's life and hit 3 targets with one shot.  Each character also has a special charge-up behavior that automatically triggers when their bar is full.  One of the characters will turn and randomly attack another party member when this happens and will kill most of them with this attack.\n\nThe interface needs a lot of work as well.  Clicking through conversations often results in your character moving after the conversation has finished because the game registered the last click as a movement order.  The camera position keeps your character very low on the screen, so it's difficult to move down without resorting to manual camera control.  The camera also uses very slow panning to follow action, which I probably don't have to tell you is quite annoying.\n\nOn top of those problems, the game engine is simply atrocious.  The graphics are pretty simple, yet the game stutters like I'm trying to run a game from 5 years in the future on my computer.  Turning on the "quality renderer" option makes the game look worse with reduced lighting and really nasty flickering shadows under plants.  There are also numerous graphical glitches with water, and flashing triangles across the screen if I zoom the camera out.\n\nI'm having a hard time recommending this game.  While the game itself is compelling, there's too many bugs and design flaws that get in the way of enjoying it.","February 25, 2013","false","9.9"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

I think the saving grace is supposed to be the dialogue, but it's only funny 1/20 lines. I laughed at a few parts, but the showing lack of intellgence made my insides shrivel. maybe the translation is at fault.... maybe, but poorly veiled fantasy references, reddit tier "video game logic" jokes, half-naked women, and/or unserving racial stereotypes aren't funny.\n\nevery character is one-dimensional. not surprsing for a comedy. but to call it story focus is a sham. with the semidivine exception of the holy avatar, not a single one of these characters is memorable or clever. nothing in the story will stay with you or impress. it seeks humor only and surface humor at that. it's a very shallow game that's absolutely painful to play if it cannot make you laugh.\n\nwith no driving force, it's comforting to know that the game itself is fundamentally broken. bugs and crashes are common force - the end of level event did not trigger properly and I was forced to reload an older save, when my main character was killed at one point the death filter that occurs when he dies was permanently stuck on, and when attacking on a bridge the game totally and entirely crashed. but the broken nature of the game doesn't stop with its programming\n\nthe pathing when using right-click-to-attack prioritizes stepping in the highest defensive terrain than maximizing a character's range or staying away from enemies. of course, moving and attack can be done seperately, but it's not as obvious as click to attack. click to attack will inevitably get a character killed. logically, it should move to the closest space and attack, not walk out and around to a bush. logic isn't this game's strong point.\n\nthe obsession meter might be the worst mechanic to ever be featured in a game period. as characters are attacked - or for a few preform attacks - a red meter fills up. when it fills, characters do something, ah, unique. this might be putting friend and foe to sleep, but it's probably hitting one of your allies. actually for over half of your small army, it's hitting your own allies. having your beserker or healer hit - not even killed - might force you to lose the whole map because dice roll decided that they'd kill your main character. obsession is not fun. it's supposed to be funny and keeping tabs on it is apparently another layer of strategy, but there's nothing good about it. it doesn't enhance the experience, it screws it all up. nearly all of the times I lost, I lost because my own ally killed me, and there was little control I had. to avoid obsession, you're forced to bench characters, effectively limiting strategy instead of enhancing it\n\nthat's implying this game gives you any moments of strategy. using items have no repurcussions. you could win a whole map with one character and potions. I very near did that from time to time. equipment is extremely limited and so are character abilities. the effects range from overpowered to completely useless, with nothing balanced in between. status effects always work and devalue any challenge the game could present. considering the writing is bland, the artstyle is amateurish, and the music is generic, it delivers on absolutely no fronts. and the gall of it all is that every asset in the game repeats multiple times. you fight the same enemies constantly and return to a too small set of maps. characters end up all with the same obsession and the grand penultimate insult is a new character that is an exact clone of the main character moves and all. I think that's supposed to be a joke, but after redoing so much of the same crap then given the same crappy character again, I took it personal. small stat increases greatly overpower characters and there is no linear balance from one map to the next\n\nif grotesque tactics is funny it's for all the wrong reasons","December 28, 2013","false","11.5"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/46450/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","For being a turn based RPG, so many design mistakes and details are left out. First off, yes there are some translation mistakes. Also, it seems like the game tries too hard to be funny and conversations are way longer than they need to be with a lot of pointless conversation. How the game plays out is you are transported to a single map and you need to finish the objective and move on. You fight pretty similar guys and find uninteresting upgrades of gear that just give slightly better stats. Then there are all the design mistakes. You can see all of your party's health, but its at once and jumbled all over the screen in no order. There is no way to see the health or stat bar of enemies. You can sit there and try and hold the cursor over the enemy and a number will pop up for health, but it's finnicky and a bar would be better. Also, you have no idea how much damage your characters do. I would have an item that says it does 3-4 damage, but my attack would do 7 damage. This is stupid because in turn-based games you need to know if your attack will finish someone or not to plan your turn, and it isn't there in this. You dont upgrade characters at all, you just get 2 abilities total and it auto upgrades stats. As for abilities, they aren't described well and you usually never know what happens with them. They will say they do increased damage and have an effect, but you don't know how much more, and the effect is not described so you don't know the specifics of it. So once again this ruins the planning part. As for battle, if your characters die it does not seem you are able to revive them, at least this isn't explained, meaning you have to go the entire map without them, which seems dumb. As for ranged characters, they are done poorly. It does not tell you how far away you can attack enemies, and in once instance I targeted someone to attack and it made my character run up right next to them to attack. Even when it does have you attack, it only has you 1 square back, which makes no sense, especially because you can't move after attacking. The board does not clearly show you how far you can move, as many times against dark grass and at night my guy would keep moving but it would be side to side and then I would finally realize they couldn't go further. Every time you get to where you can't go further, you must manually end your turn. It is annoying, but there is the bonus factor you don't end the turn by moving one way, you can walk back and go a different way if you want, decreasing moving mistakes. Another huge mistake is you can't cancel an attack. If I click to attack someone 6 spaces away and instantly change my mind and click my guy to instead move or stop him, it should change his direction or stop the attack, because I'm obviously doing it for a reason. But in this game he cannot change course for some reason no matter what you do......durrrr???\n\nThere is also the problem of the camera. If will move super far if you just tap it, but when your character is moving you cant pan it at all, which makes no sense. The same is said with rotation. You also can't pan the camera out enough to see the map fully, so you have to pan all around it and back to your party, only seeing sections of a time, but decreasing how much you can see. Interactibility is a huge problem. You cannot see when you can loot someone or interact with something, and there is no button to show all interactable objects like there should be. When you try looting or opening a chest, it is annoying and finnicky, and you have to click multiple times on the exact perfect spot to do it. Also, there is basically no help or direction on the map, and there is no mini-map with objective markers. I got stuck on a map and quit because I had to slowly pan around it but it looked like I had found everything but I could not press a button to see anything interactable or any enemies, and there was no objective marker. Also, a button to see all enemy's bars in the area like you see your own would be helpful. The obsessions is a stupid worthless feature. You never know when it's coming, and you don't know exactly what triggers it. When it happens they almost always hinder you, so its basically a stupid handicap put on so the developer's could include it as a feature on the game description tab. The L/R mouse buttons make no sense either. L and R move you, but only L attacks, but only R picks up items from chests, but only L opens the chest, and only L (or R, cant rememer) switches item to what you are currently wearing, but you have to manually drag items you have to sell them, and only L (or R, once again forget) buys an item........you get the picture, no consistency, meaning you always hit the wrong button because you forget which does what.\n\nSo basically none of the UI or design of the game makes it cohesive to play, leading to frustration more than fun. 4.5/10.","March 20, 2015","false","2.6"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

Most significantly, the abundant dialogue in the game overrelies on a self-aware, snarky sense of humor that isn't zany, smart, or original enough to even garner a chuckle.\n\nReturning to my initial disgust momentarily: if this game weren't so intent on providing textures, lighting affects, and animations that the coding simply cannot support, it would almost be playably lukewarm.

I love turn based strategy games (Cute ones like Disgaea, serious ones like X-Com, easy ones like Final Fantasy Tactics, and unforgiving ones like Jagged Alliance).  I thought this one would be right up my alley.  Here is why it wasn't.\n\nThe gameplay lacks real strategy.  There isn't any units you control outside of what they issue you in the story.  Each unit is unique in character, has semi-unique abilities (all three archers have little variation), and is limited to how they level up (limited, set number of possible encounters).  Keeping low levels up to speed becomes exceedingly difficult as the stronger characters tend to have to bail out the weaker.  The characters have unique abilities (similar to the Final Fantasy Limit Break system), but they tend to be counter-intuitive to how they are used.  When the characters see enough action, their special ability happens automatically, which can affect both your enemy and friendlies the same way.  If that wasn't frustrating enough, there are also neutral monsters that will sometimes attack your enemies for you.  That sounds fun and exciting at first, but then you realize they only take away xp from your own units.  Due to the lack of balance between weak and strong units, and the limited amount of xp to be gained, battlegrounds can turn in to a game of luck more than strategy.\n\nThe lack of camera controls, playable area (boundaries), and fixed (unchangable) game controls also make for frustration as well.  They don't break the game entirely, but still will probably be noticed enough to slow down the flow of gameplay.\n\nI would like to play a polished version of this game, with some random encounters added to train up my low characters, but that simply will never happen.","March 30, 2014","false","13.8"," 0 of 8 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","8","0","0"

This is a custom built gaming rig. Some people have gotten the game to work with their systems but it does not work with mine. I've tried to fix but couldn't.\n\nI want to play this game but you should consider this a valid negative review because I can't play it despite meeting the system requirements. It is because of Steam's no refund policy.\n\nHere it is: "As with most software products, unless required by local law, we do not offer refunds or exchanges on games, DLC or in-game items purchased on our website or through the Steam Client.  Please review Section 3 of the Steam Subscriber Agreement for more information."\n\nBTW, if you check section 3 you'll see "legalase" for this paraphrasing, "If you live in the EU you have the right to cancel payment as long as you do not start the game." That legal gist is that even if the game does not launch properly, as long as it launched it is considered purchased.\n\nCurrently 0% of people found this review useful. Perhaps that is because they perceived that any technical issues on the customer's side is the customer's fault and shouldn't be mentioned in a review. However this is part of the review process. If you can't use a product and there is no clear reason for why the product is faulty and no ability to return said faulty product it looks poorly on the company providing the content as well as the company distributing it.\n\nShould I simply say, "Caveat emptor." "Buyer Beware."?\n\nThis warning may at least help you consider your purchase with more information available, specifically that the product may not work.","August 25, 2014","false","0.1"," 0 of 10 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","10","0","0"

It tries its very hardest to use satire to ridicule the RPG genre, but the end result was a giant mess of unfunny, immature, and amateurish jokes slapped on to one of the most un-playble and boring indie rpg game in creation. I tried very hard to like this game, but the static/boring loot and absolutely tasteless characters made it very impossible to even pass this game off as average. The story is a joke so I can’t even list that as a positive for this game. The gameplay in combat is ridiculously slow and mundane, this game is turn based so controlling a massive team of characters is a big chore especially when they all do pretty much the same thing in terms of mechanics. Avoid this title; you can surely spend 10 dollars on a much more deserving game.","July 25, 2012","false","18.9"," 2 of 16 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","2","16","0","12"
