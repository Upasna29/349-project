The bad news is now I can't refund it. There is no gameplay here. There is no effort. Premade Unity assets won't blow your helmet off, so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ - line up. Avoid like the plague if you enjoy creativity or even decent controls.","November 1, 2015","false","0.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","1"

The Rollingball's Melody is so simple a concept that you wouldn't think it possible to screw it up this royally. Make a playlist from your music files, then make the ball jump from one platform to another using the arrow keys. The platforms will jerk up and down violently and unpredictably in time with your music. This essentially makes the game a platformer with bad controls further complicated by platforms that bounce around wildly and make it difficult to accurately time your jumps. I have to laugh at reviews that describe this game as "relaxing." The Rollingball's Melody is a paradigm of artificial difficulty and minimal effort in all aspects of design.","October 30, 2015","false","0.9"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","12","17","2","6"

Each time you play it's exactly the same.\nYou can't alttab the game it will result in game freezeing itself on one frame.\nFreezing can be caused by various things and even though I played the game for very short time and I had to start it like 20 times.\nIf you are into achievments, don't even bother(dev has 93 hrs spent ingame and only 1(!) achievment).\nHonestly playing any sort of a bit faster/groovier music makes the jumps impossible to hit.\nIf you go too far you get stuck outside of the platforms and the game just keeps going and if you try to restart it will just crash.\n"Various environments" - just added bunch of incoherent pixelated garbage in the background that literally does nothing.\n\nAnyways I wanted to like this game but it's simply awful. I played various of music generated games and this one is defienietly the worst.\nThe only thing this game may do is give you some money back with its trading cards.\n\n","November 2, 2015","false","0.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yuritopia/recommended/409310/","yuritopia","Archime∂es","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yuritopia/","238 products in account","This game is very entertaining and enjoyable for all music themed game lovers, with an added bonus that multiple local friends can be bouncing around and hopping on the platforms all at once making it a very enjoyable and amusingly confusing time of bouncy jumpy fun. It's a tricky music platformer that you play with your favorite songs you can import into the game, unfortunately not including any original pieces / pre-installed songs so you HAVE to import your own music (as if that is a problem :P) There are some "unique stages" within your play that feature random designs on the platforms that I thought were . Unfortunately, I have also experience some issues where I clip through an edge when I'm landing or I just fall through the ground before I jump occasionally, but not problematic enough to cause anger or hatred towards the game, which the developer is working on patching as of the last time I updated this review. Like most music games that involve importing your own music files, if it doesn't have an obvious beat or inaudible quality, the game won't register the tempo of the song and kind of just randomly bounce and thump around randomly off tempo, but with a feature ingeniously implimented in this game, there is a "Force Meter" located on the importing screen window. So if you feel a song isn't properly registering your songs beat or not pumping the jam to your liking, increase the "Force" of the song when importing it for a better experience. The game offers its simplistic and challenging aspects for gamers who enjoy music themed games, and a relaxing, yet exciting continuous hours of gameplay. Would I reccomend this game? I would indeed, very affordable and fair price, and easy to navigate song menu and import your favorite tunes and play instantly!","October 19, 2015","true","2.2"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","6"

The max number of planks I was able to get was 25 then 50 but most game where 12 or less.\n\n\nThis is a simple yet challenging platformer. The graphics are okay but the gameplay is difficult and repetitive.  The gameplay consists of jumping a ball from one plank to another.  Plank are moving up and down and are of various widths with random distances between.\n\n","November 6, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"
