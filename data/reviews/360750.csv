It didn't hold my interest for more than a few levels, but my first impression was positive. The devs contributed to that by providing Steam keys for people who bought the game from the now defunct Indie Royale, a service that not every dev provides.\n\nHowever, today I received an email in which the devs offer a bribe of several additional keys, in exchange for a positive review. Here is a screenshot of the email: http://i60.tinypic.com/dfkj9c.jpg\n\nUnfortunately this means that I cannot recommend this game. If the devs themselves have so little confidence in their game that they deem bribes necessary to garner positive reviews, then that makes me very skeptical about the game's quality. I would also take positive reviews of this game with a grain of salt, since I may not be the only one who received such an offer.","October 18, 2015","false","3.9"," 37 of 44 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","37","44","2","9"

This could have been just a forgettable, badly executed game, but some lousy policies by the developers earn it a wholeheartedly bad review.\n\nFirst of all: If you like tower defense games, this is NOT one. It's an arcade shooter, where you get to place your turrets on random positions that offer minimal opportunity for strategic planning. Sadly for this type of shooter, the turrets turn incredibly slowly, making this a game where you basically keep your finger pressed on the mouse button till it cramps while staring at the screen unable to do anything. Which is fine, since despite all the pretty (boring) explosions that obscure half your screen, nothing really much happens when the enemy ships fly over your base and turrets: you may get some damage, you click to heal, done. No upgrades are possible except at the start of the level, but you can place mines and other powerups that you pick up. This practically means that you have to take your mouse away from shooting, pick up the mine (or whatever, they all look the same, no tooltips) from the top of the screen, stare at the available positions on the grid and drag&drop them where you want, all while you're still being attacked - so in fact you just don't do it, it's never worth it. If that doesn't make any game design sense to you, that's because this game had the minimum amount of thought put into it.\n\nOn top of the boring, simplistic gameplay, there are some glaring language errors in the game, weird lag at random intervals, very slow loading screens, a badly implemented GUI that lacks basic functionalities, and a totally linear progression that expects you to finish every level on easy before trying harder difficulties. It has also never been updated, and the devs seem totally absent.\n\nAs a last note of warning, I would be highly suspicious of the positive reviews. Some steam players allege to have been offered steam keys and/or more keys of the game in exchange for a positive review, and one offers some proof. Normally I'd say take everything you read with a grain of salt, but this just smells too bad to completely disregard. Me, I'd just give the game a pass alltogether, you aren't missing anything.","November 15, 2015","false","1.1"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

There are some upgrades which become available slowly through-out the game, however it never really goes beyond the simple point and click to shoot things on the screen with an increasing number of turrets that all follow your cursor (with the exception of the limited-use automated ones).\n\nThis is a little time waster which kind of does what it needs to do, however there are better games out there in the genre, such as Gratuitous Space Battles, which offer more interesting mechanics and depth. This game is definitely casual, and by a developer that does not hide that fact by calling themselves "Casualogic." It is what it is.\n\nPositives:\n- Simple but pleasant 2D visuals\n- Easy to figure-out the mechanics\n- if you like random power-ups, this game can at times litter the whole screen with little orbs to give you a boost..\n\nNegatives:\n- Randomized enemy spawns, meteor (wall), and power-ups can lead to completely random mission fails or steam-roll victories (like if several cruisers spawn in one corner of the map and all fire at your base at the same time from off-screen)\n- Poor explanation on how to use certain upgrades/power-ups (although not too hard to figure-out).\n- I'm still not sure on how the whole "upgrade point" system works in this game... you deploy before the match, but where does it show my balances or explains when to use them and when to not? I get how to use them, but it's not something the game explained, when it should not be hard to do so.\n- Grammar in some of the in-game mission briefings/hints does not make sense.\n\nIs it a great game? No. Do I recommend it at full price? No. If you got it part of a bundle or on a significant sale and you like spaceships and or tower defense with some arcade-y shoot-em-up mechanics, you may actually enjoy this game. It's not a gem, and there are better games out there, but hey, it's not bad for how much I got it for... squeezed about 1.3 hours of entertainment out of this thing for a few pennies, and it probably has 4-5 hours of total content. Your typical movie gives you about the same amount of content for over $10 at the local movie theater, and will be just as forgettable.\n\nI did NOT get a free key for this review, I got it part of a VERY cheap bundle for under $2, and neither should it matter if I was given one or not. I would have given it the same review. If I had to give it a score, I would give it something around a 60% if only for the nifty 2D graphics and explosions in space... I like space. Several completely random early mission fails  kind of stopped me from playing further.","December 16, 2015","true","1.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Poor English in descriptions.\n\nAnd the developer clearly has no interest in fixing these problems, they just desperately look for any excuse to blame my computer (which is less than a year old and has no trouble running much more complex games).

No way I could turn my turrets and take them out in time.\nSaw a mine powerup on the right side where my turrets we're already aiming. Shot it. Picked it up and quickly placed the mine on top of the enemy ship cluster. Laughed as I watched them all burn up with one mine.\n\nThis is a strategy arcade shooter / tower defence / base builder game.\nIt's a nice hybrid concept and definitly fun once you realize it's not going to play like any other.\nFinding a strategy is half the fun. Like placing turrets on opposite ends and aiming down the middle, at my base, to create a crossfire effect that shoots both sides at the same time.\nOr placing a mine in a location I don't want to mess with. Or save it for when a cluster of ships group up.\nStick an automated turret to help out and tell you where enemies are coming from. Or let it handle some business while you pick up some powerups.\n\nThe game does feel slow at first because of the turn rate on turrets. But that adds to the strategy. Do you aim to the other side and use up a full 2 seconds or shoot that powerup and take the next wave out hard?\nIf it we're any faster it wouldn't give you time to think.\nLove it.\n\nI played up to the first boss, and the only con's I can find is that the translation of text into english is a bit off at certain places.\nBut this game is definitly worth the price.","April 20, 2015","true","1.0"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","14","25","0","1"

Like other reviewers I was also approached by the dev via email who asked me to write a review of the game in exchange for several more keys -- an offer which I declined. I will, however, still leave a review so feel free to skip the rest if you think I am biased because of the above.\n\nWith that said, StarFence is a simple turrent defence game in which you place turrets (manually-controlled) to shoot down incoming ships to protect a space station. Progressing through missions unlocks more difficult enemies and other turrents and/or defences to use. The basic turrents all aim towards the mouse cursor and can be placed anywhere on the screen to plan out lines of fire. Turrets can be destroyed however, and enemies target them just as happily as the space station so some thought should be put into their placement.\n\nThere seems to be a decent variety of defences and power-ups available -- automated laser turrets, friendly ships, mines, asteroids (walls), fire rate boosts, double fire, station shield, etc. Each turret can also be upgraded for arbitrary 'upgrade points' which are gained during each stage and persist across the campaign stages -- e.g. with rotation speed upgrade since by default turrets rotate sooooo slow.\n\nSpeaking of the campaign -- things start off really slow. In fact I was not sure if I could be bothered to finish the first few levels, but the game picked up the speed a few stages down the line. It gets more frentic and challenging with each campaign mission, though I have yet to get to the end so can't say just what the end game looks like. There's no story to the campaign past a simple 'you're under attack, defend yourself with these'.\n\nGame also offers a survival mode that pits a wave after wave of enemies against the defences and I can see this being a decent pastime for fans of arcade games.\n\nIn terms of presentation it's a simple 2D top-down game with static sprites moving across the screen or rotating. Laser-based projectiles look like glow-sticks hurtling through space and rockets resemble javelins with their long exhaust trails. It's not bad though, simple but agreeable and not too harsh on the eyes.\n\nWould I recommend it? Yeah, kinda. I'd say it's a 'for fans of genre only' kinda game. If you like the sound of an arcadey turret defence game and need something to now and then offer distraction from other games then yeah, this might be worth the while at $5.","October 23, 2015","true","3.5"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"

Enemy ships have been designed by a detail artist. The actual gameplay puts your base at the center of the screen and enemies are appearing around at random spots and closing in on your base or defences.\n\nYour defences are made out of turrets that you place around the map. Just keep the mouse button pressed and target everything brown :) As you'll find out later on there's little skill or tactic involved since EVERYTHING is TOTALLY random, which will discourage some people.\n\nThe upgrade system is what you'd expect; each level you start crappy but you can spend upgrade points acquire during previous maps to give you an edge. Upgrade points are currency based and must somehow be farmed during each level so you can spend more of them later on.\n\nSuccess in each map is MOSTLY depending on your luck which is made up of powerups that defeated enemies drop. If this game had no powerups you'd be dead.. period. Powerups type and amount are also random and theres a ton of them.\n\nThere are bosses... extremely well drawn giant ships that will eventually be very hard to kill unless you are lucky. If there is a small amount of strategy involved in this game you'll find it at bosses where you will want to keep some turrets and walls that you'll deploy once the boss enters the map... cant prepare in advance since its spawn point is RANDOM :)\n\nTo sum it up this game will entertain you, even stress you at some point. The gameplay is kind of explosive but slow/sluggish.. which is a feature, not a bug. Finally... the effort put into this title by the dev is remarkable, precise... masterful. I bow down before these finely detailed ships.","August 8, 2015","true","1.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Imagine a game where you place turrets, like a tower defence ... game but then you must manually fire them in an arcade fashion. That completely ruins it for me. I was expecting much more of a compromise between a shooter and a tower defence game. StarFence is essentially an arcade shooter where there's no movement, just shooting and using power-ups. Using the power-ups is also awkward.\n\nOverall I wouldn't recommend it.","April 6","false","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
