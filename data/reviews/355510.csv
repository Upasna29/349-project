There is also an Infinite level that uses Steam's leaderboards to save your score.\n\nThe most offensive thing about this game is probably no resolution options and the wasted space due to the vertical game but it is still fun to play.","January 9","true","1.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

Instead, we get a cookie cutter "puzzle" game where the theme is just slapped on top of a set of generic game mechanics.","February 4","false","0.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Another play on same level would not result in the same outcome because of the angle the luggage fell..\nThat's not my idea of "replay value" lol.\n\nSeems like a mobile port.. even in the trailer it's a finger doing the playing.\n\nAnother gripe I have with the game.. redundant scoring system (stars) and no option to skip a level.\nSo the level I quit on was 1:15 minutes long.  I failed two luggages (1 star left).  Time runs out so I lose.\nLiterally impossible to 1 star that level because missing two luggages makes you not have enough time to complete, so I'd have to play it again and again just to move on..\n/nope\n\nIf you REALLY like puzzle games, then go for it.. if you were looking for a "casual" puzzle game to mess around in and have a little fun.. pass.\n\nGameplay video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5yPlk4GTAY","January 12","false","0.3"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","2"

Puzzle element a bit simplistic on the surface, but throws you for a loop as you progress deeper into the game!","February 5","true","0.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So you either get bored, or annoyed.","February 14","false","0.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"
