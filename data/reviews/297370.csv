"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/297370/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Hero Of Many tells the story of an orb-like creature who’s on a quest to defeat ‘black’ (evil) and at the same time save as many of its friends as possible. It draws inspiration from several games, including Journey, Limbo and even a bit of Pikmin. ‘Three awesome games ? This must be awesome too then’, I hear you say ? Well, yes and no.\n\nLet me start by saying why I think it draws inspiration from the aforementioned games:\nJourney because it tells a story without saying or showing any words; you start the game and you can pretty much immediately control the main character. Limbo because of its silhouette art style, even if it uses some background colors later on and Pikmin because you’ll be guiding your friends through obstacles, while avoiding and killing enemies.\nBut you don’t directly control your tadpole-like creatures. You can send them into a certain direction but you don’t control their actions. They’ll do the best they can, so if they see something edible they will consume it and if they need to break something they’ll break it. Maybe not all of them, but some of them, at least. Still, it’s all mostly an automatic process.\n\nYou’ll guide your character and the rest of the creatures through 26 levels. Except for a few of them, these levels are built in largely the same way. Navigate through maze-like levels while saving your friends and killing/avoiding enemies and get to the exit. This is fun and interesting at first, and like I said, the game does throw a few other challenges your way later in the game, but you’ll be doing mostly the same stuff for the entire duration of the game.\nThis isn’t a long game with just a few hours of gameplay but halfway through I grew a bit bored by it. There wasn’t much of a challenge and you’d rarely die. Was the entire game going to be this easy ? The answer is no. Because halfway through you’ll also start earning new powers. These don’t seem like much, but they’re actually quite handy once you realize the game would’ve been so much easier if you’d have started with them. So, they’re a good addition to your character and they fit the game; nothing over-the-top. You’ll earn a power to attract your buddies, you’ll earn a power to bounce off enemies/open doors and you’ll earn a power to destroy things. And yes, during the course of the game you will eventually die. Probably several times. At times it won’t always be exactly clear what’s expected of you and it might take you a few tries more than it officially should take you. This is one of the shortcomings of trying to let people experience the story instead of actually telling it. You’ll probably learn it after a while anyway, but I made me feel bitter about the game, especially because things should feel natural if you do it this way.\n\nAs I already mentioned the game’s graphics reminded me of those of Limbo, but with some much needed colors. Your creature will have a bit of color inside of it, and the backgrounds, but the rest of it is all black and white. It’s a good contrast and the use of colors give you an idea of progression.\nIt all looks beautiful in motion, though there is a bit of stutter every now and then. Note that the framerate doesn’t drop, not even for a second, but somehow the game does slow down from time to time. Really weird and this shouldn’t happen in a 2D game.\nThe interface is clearly made with mobile phones in mind and it’s one of the things that could’ve used a bit of extra work. Don’t get me wrong, it all works very nicely. It’s just shown in such a way that I was frequently reminded that I’m dealing with a port here.\nThe music is beautifully orchestrated and has a good, bombastic atmosphere. I’m not sure if a band was really used here, or that it was all manufactured but I was absolutely impressed by it. Excellent work, really.\n\nHero Of Many isn’t a long game and it should take you roughly 5-6 hours to complete. After that there’s no real reason to go through it again, but that’s okay. I think it’s a game meant to be played just once, or at least once every (couple of) year(s). For me personally it was long enough, I actually would’ve enjoyed it a bit more if it was shorter, but most of you will enjoy it regardless.\n\nHero Of Many isn’t my hero, but it might just be for the rest of you. In that case its title was carefully chosen. It’s an enjoyable game that drags on for a bit too long but it’s not in the least boring or bad enough to not play it. So give it a try if you can.\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","September 15, 2014","true","5.8"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","39","45","0","3"

Seemingly a metaphorical game of light versus dark, with no gray areas. You play as a small blob of light, and it’s that blob that the player controls with the mouse.\n\nBut you don’t play against the forces of darkness unassisted. Nor will you stay a small blob. As you travel through what is apparently an underwater world, you come across stationary small blobs, and close proximity causes you both to merge, increasing your size. You will also encounter fish-looking characters: bright ones will join you, dark ones will attack you and your “swarm”. Perhaps you can sneak past the dark ones, or attract some away, keeping battles small and manageable. But there seem to be some larger dark creatures that cannot be defeated, and your swarm cannot protect you against them for long….\n\n“Hero of Many” seems simple, and to some degree it is. But you are given almost no instructions, which adds to the game’s complexity. The world you inhabit is large, with many small and intertwining passages. Lights go on along the edges to show where you’ve been, and large crystals act as highly visible save points. The goal is to advance to a sort of “drain”, leading to the next level, with as many swarm members as possible.\n\nOthers things will be encountered in the game. As your swarm progress in the game it will encounter food, dangerous plants (or not, how to tell?) and large swarms of dark enemies. Also, they will constantly lose small bits of light, weakening steadily. Individual swarm members aren’t smart, and will easily get separated or lost from the main swarm. The larger the swarm, the harder to lead or control, and the more likely lost to the dangers they will encounter. But, the greater the protection offered by larger swarms.\n\n“Hero of Many” is a surprisingly endearing game, and rapidly develops a sense of personality. The swarm is so dedicated to providing protection that the desire to return that protection is very strong. The save point are logical and reasonable, and I can only imagine that further levels become more challenging and interesting. At this low (discount) price, I would give “Hero of Many” my strongest recommendation.\n\nThank you.","September 19, 2015","true","3.2"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","3"

There are some nice sequences in the 2 hrs I put in (such as the creature that swallows you), but it was surrounded by boring, lifeless exploration with almost no emotional story to speak of (that many other reviewers have mentioned).  Perhaps I didn't get far enough to see it, but I shouldn't have to endure 2 hours or boring "gameplay" where I'm just guiding me and my little sperm (ahem, alien creatures) through almost palette swapped areas.\n\nThe game is supposed to be laid back, and I get that.  I need a reason to keep playing though even if that's the case, and never got it.  The music is well done, the sound effects of the creatures is striking, but that's about it.\n\nIt's not a terrible game on all accounts, but make sure you know what you're getting into before diving in.  I saw the "97% positive" at the time of my little review here, and felt I needed to warn the good folks on Steam that this game may not deserve that level of praise.  I recommend getting it for cheap if you're keen on trying it.","June 3, 2015","false","1.8"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","20","25","0","0"

And I probably I would have done it if I hadn't found some empathy for this little czech studio...\n\nThe game starts great. Nice visuals, great atmosphere and fantastic, FANTASTIC music. The gameplay is simple but quite entertaining. But soon the first flaws will surface:\nYou outrun the screen. Yes, the bane of old side-scrollers has returned. Often the camera is just not fast enought to follow you properly and then you basically can't see where you are going. Run into a mine and say goodbye to your beloved swarm.\nUnskippable cutscenes! How is this still a thing?! No, I really don't need to see the same animation for the 20th time after loading the checkpoint, goddammit!\nThe game barely explains anything. For example, I've finished it and still I'm not sure what those energy orbs were useful for.\nIn a game where everything around you is glowing white it's not a good idea to make the mouse cursor a tiny white circle. I was constantly losing track of it, having to pause the game to actually find the cursor.\nHero of too many levels - yes, the game is too long. Game with such a simple gameplay gets repetitive fast and it doesn't introduce enough new mechanics or environments to keep it fresh.\nAnd then came level 17 - saving the Red queen. I still have no idea how to finish the level properly. You're supposed to go through a tunnel, pass some obstacles and finally reach the queen but the tunnel is blocked at the end and I've never found a way to open it. After many attempts I gave up and checked the only available walkthrough on YouTube.\nThe youtuber did something I would have never thought of - he ignored the tunnel and using a weird trick he got into a different tunnel that seemed to be inaccessible. He went through, ignored the queen and went straight to the exit and somehow succeeded. And yes, this is the only way that seems to be working. What stupid design is that?\n\nFrom now on the game went into a "wtf am I supposed to do" mode. I'm not going to talk about every flawed level so let's just mention the final bosses (spoilers ahead).\nThe dragon boss seems to be pretty straightforward, the problem is there is no indication you actually damage him. I was circling around him like crazy not sure if there is an end to it because I had no idea if I'm actually hitting him (thankfully I was, he just had a ton of hitpoints).\nThe final boss is actually even worse. I've beaten him on my fourth attempt yet I have no idea how did I do that. He just started dying around the lanterns even he was ok around them a minute before... I don't know... I was pretty annoyed by the game by then so I was glad it was over.\n\nOverall: It's a decent game with some major design flaws, especially in the last third. We really need a neutral rating on Steam.","January 18","true","9.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The simplicity of the game experienced in the first few minutes of gameplay is stunning – yet genius and immersive.\n\nThe player takes the role as a nameless and thus anonymous orb-like microorganism on a quest to defeat lethal black counterparts whilst rescuing as many friends as possible. In good accordance with the wordless story, there is no way of telling which way is the correct way through any of the 26 different maze-like maps. Players may only navigate using their memory, or by the guidance of carefully placed lanterns which gets activated once passed. However, as there is no time limit, exploration immediately becomes the natural first priority. By exploring all caves and corridors the player furthermore ensures to find close-to-all friends – the more friends you collect, the stronger (and exposed) you become.\n\nHero of Many is an atmospheric-action adventure set in a deep undersea and monochrome world with an immersive design. Packed with friends and foes, exploration and survival becomes a natural aspect of the game, and without words or back-story, the player is allowed and encouraged to create their own story and follow their own paths.\n\nRead my full review here: http://212fahrenheit.reviews/?p=359","September 22, 2014","true","6.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

It's an intriguing game with danger around every turn but it still allows you to play at your own pace.....

Going through the game, you want to keep your white fish with you, but they get caught on all manner of things or just fall behind. As a result, I find myself going back trying to get them out repeatedly. Perhaps you are supposed to leave them there, but that leaves you vulnerable to the black fish and makes you feel kind of like a a-hole (it's hero of many, not deserter of many).\nI also find the noise the black fish make to be quite irritating (it's a shrill monkey-like noise).\n\nThe puzzles provided in the game are easy and far between. As a result, most of what you'll be doing is accidentally losing your fish as you go through a tunnel. Or accidentally trapping yourself by rolling a rock you thought you needed to move into the only exit, efficiently blocking it and forcing you to start over.\n\nOn the plus side, check points are frequent, the music is nice (but not outstanding), and the game looks good.","January 24","false","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay is pretty simple, and while you do get some new abilities, it's mostly about guiding and taking care of your little group and make sure that they don't take on too many enemies at a a time.\n\nUnfortunately, the gameplay does get repetitive after a while, and it's not really interesting enough to support the 7 or so hours the game takes. Several times I thought a cutscene meant the end, only to be put in a very similar level only with different background color. At the end I was just rushing through, not exploring, having lost the patience. If you want to invest the time for an at times very lovely and meditative experience, it's well worth it , even though it gets long-winded.\n\nIn conclusion,  a wonderful little game - but outstays it's welcome a bit by being simply too long for the very basic game play.","March 13, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a very polished, very beautiful game, that has perfectly crafted aesthetic. It has a very deep story line of growth and death, redemption and vengeance, and got me to connect with little faceless /things/ on a much deeper level than some blockbuster rpgs out there. There is no dialogue here, the story is fleshed out purely through gameplay, and unobtrusive "cutscenes" where you give up control for a couple of seconds of scripted actions that don't really stop the pace. The music also serves as a sort of exposition on what you're supposed to feel, and the soundtrack is great. I'm not finished with the game yet, but even so far it has been totally worth it. There are puzzles that don't feel like puzzles. The game teaches you the quirks without a word, yet it does not feel like it's holding your hand.\n\nIn the game, you guide a silver circle-thing through a maze-like world with other critters. You get flagellated creatures (referred to as 'friends' in the achievements) to follow you. The conflict is brought out by a race of equivalent creatures, only they are black. You find that they attack you on sight, and, as you have no defences against them, you need your friends to save you.\n\nThere are sections of the game where you have very few friends (if at all), and the game plays very much like a stealth game, with you trying to make sure enemies don't see you. It plays like an RTS/RPG when you are up against the other side (black friends? enemies?) with a similar forces. It has amusing puzzles that will make you go "ahhh!!" when you realize the mechanics behind them. It will have you feeling triumphant after you've first beat the higher class enemies. It will have you feel scared for your life whilst you're being chased. It will make you feel sorrowful and self-loathing when the one friend that stuck by you gets impaled on a spike, or eaten by hanging flagella because you led him there.\n\nThe only thing that can count as a con here is the minimalistic UI. Though it works great aesthetically, it will take you a couple of seconds to realize what the few buttons that there are do, but once you do, you intuit it quite well. During the actual game, there are no UI elements unless you pause the game., which is just another way this game reaches the level of immersion it does. Writing this review has been hard as none of the creatures are really given in-game names.\n\nTL;DR: Beautifully crafted, excellent use of color and sound to create a story. Like a Japanese garden, Hero of Many has attained a level of aesthetic perfection where nothing can be taken out or added without detracting from its experience.","May 29, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
