The levels are fun and the mechanics are interesting. The best part of the game is the multiplayer. Coming up with better designs than your friends is challenging and competitive. It is a type of multiplayer you don't see too often.\n\nPro's:\n-Cheap\n-Easy to understand gameplay\n-Sandbox\n-Possibility to build complex things\n-Graphics are simple but still very pleasent to look at\n-Multiplayer with friends is very fun\n\nCon's:\n-Less than 20 singleplayer levels\n-Somewhat annoying gui and building becomes very tedious as there are no keyboard shortcuts\n-The game doesn't explain mechanics very well even though there is a tutorial (I had to make multiple google searches for an understanding of basic game mechanics)\n\nConclusion:\nIf you have an extra $6 in your steam wallet and are interested in getting a fun sandbox building game then get it. The game is fun for several hours but becomes a lot more worth if you and a friend both buy it as there are under 20 levels for singleplayer.","March 23","true","1.3"," 87 of 94 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","87","94","5","0"

The menus are crap, the user experience is crap (no real shortcuts, barely any keyboard bindings so I hope you have a QWERTY) and the graphics really aren't to die for.\n\nThe idea is good though, I guess it's still fun to play and I just love building / physics games. I'd maybe wait for a few updates before purchasing it, hopefully those will be adressed, but overall it's worth it's price right now.","March 24","true","0.3"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GeneralMarkimoo/recommended/411750/","GeneralMarkimoo","Teminator","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GeneralMarkimoo/","68 products in account","Well I put quite a few hours into this game. For what it is, it's not bad at all. All the negetive reviews have less than an hour so I wouldn't even think about listening to them.\nPros-\n-Decent price\n-Decent graphics (I really dont care about graphics, heck I think half life one looks good.)\n-Some fun and challanging single player levels like protecting a crown from getting shot off its stand, making towers that have to survive for 20 seconds without falling, making a bridge for a ball to roll acrossed (sounds boring but it gets crazy), and some other things.\n-The TNT is pretty cool\n-You can move the block up and down or left and right if you hold down the left mouse button while placing so its not limited (if it on a flat serface it goes up and down, side of something left and right)\n-The newest update added more short cuts and a reset button\n-Theres probably more but I cant remember\n\nCons-\n-Needs trangles for ramps\n-Needs a copy and paste tool insted of the inventions which takes to long to get too.\n-Multiplayer is empty because no one really plays.\n-Takes to long to get from the menu to a game, but there might be a reason.\n\nThats all the important stuff I could think of, Also I saw a review that says rockets that point up but they do you just press  R or go into options (people need to look at the interface more). I wasn't to sure about buying this game at first but its worth it to me and I'd say buy the game if you like physics, building and explosives.","March 25","true","10.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I've only been playing for les than an hour, and I decided to write my first review!! It just came out today, March 23, but it is already one of my fav Steam games!! The only problems are that there are no keyboard shortcuts for blocks & building gets tedious since you can't always place a block on the correct level w/o lining it up lower. If you have $6, GET THIS GAME!!","March 23","true","1.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

One level of tutorial and you are ready to go. the challenges teach you the rest.\n\nrecomendations? add some things that make me not have to redesigne the entire launcher just because i messed up the angle. tone it down with the brightness of the grass?\n\nI cant give you pointers in technical issues as i have a very high end pc, so if there are any issues, my pc just powers through them.\n\nGood game, wont be refunding it XD it does need work","March 23","true","0.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Cool concept, good physics, the building itself is awkward and the game is a bit slow. It could use some more work in my opinion. Below I posted a First Impressions video. It's about 21 minutes long.\nIf possible I would vote neutral. But I'll give it an upvote as I assume they will address certain problems.\nEdit: A few days later they've already addressed some UI problems. So I have good hope for this game. It is still the least intuitive UI ever though. But let's hope they keep improving it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz7q-7liOIs&ab_channel=OttoNL","March 24","true","1.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Its so fun to log onto the game and build to your hearts conent and hope you dont f up and ruin your creation. Its building mecanics are point and click building and it works well. I like that unlike Minecraft (which i love :) this game has you have physics when playing. So if you F up like i did on probably 20 times so far you can have a catastrophic collapse. Thats the fun of the game. Building something then saving the world and trying to get it to what you want without collapsing. The amazing dev also added some fun special blocks to mess with yourselves and your friends. If you are concerned with the lack of polish / content (which the game really has great content/replay value) dont worry. The game has been out a week and already 2 major updates. One even came out a day after the game. This guy cares about the game and you can tell he will support it. So the question remains would i recommend this game? YES YES YES!!! I would give this game a................. 9/10 Its amazing for what it is but bring it just a step higher dev which i know you will and you will get 10/10","March 31","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's smooth, with nice graphics and tons of fun. The gameplay is pretty simple, it even includes multiplayer and sandbox mode. Although i hope that there will be more content added soon, workshop would be great too. And it's incredibly cheap, only like 5€.

Why not just put that in levels. I was trying to build a tower for one of the levels, which had to be 25m tall and stand for 20s. Easy enough. But you can't put blocks where you want them, instead they're in some sort of horrible grid that doesn't fit them together properly.","March 25","false","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
