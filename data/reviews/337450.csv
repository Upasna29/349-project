Controls may feel a little floaty at first but you soon realize that's because the game design is gravity/physics based. Levels increase in difficulty quickly and do include very basic highscore charts for those seeking 'perfect' runs.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUCi9nk7Lrw\n\n@developer\nAdding a few achievements wouldn't hurt and most people love them.","January 10, 2015","true","0.5"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","29","36","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDeluxeTux/recommended/337450/","TheDeluxeTux","TheDeluxeTux","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDeluxeTux/","305 products in account","Dream Tale is a simple, bare-bones platformer in which you are a young girl navigating a trippy, space-y dream-world in search of her dog.     I was hoping for an exploration experience along the lines of Knytt, but that's not really what this game is.  It's broken up into a series of mini-levels that each take about 90 seconds or so to finish, provided you don't die.  Controls are limited to walking and jumping, and the only goal is to reach the portal and collect as many pellets as you can along the way to increase your score.  Touching an enemy or falling into a pit is instadeath, and results in you restarting from the beginning.  There is a checkpoint system implemented, but not very well - if you die, you begin from the checkpoint, but your level progress is reset in terms of points and the things you've collected.  You may also find the titular keys scattered about, and they are collectable, but I can't figure out what they do, if anything.\n\n\nWhile Dream Tale plays just fine, there's a few areas that could use some work.  The store page boasts four worlds, but they all look extremely samey - I'd love some visual variety.  I'd also like some enemy variety, too - there's two basic enemies - the blobs that crawl back and forth on horizontal platforms, and the blobs that fly in one of three preset patterns.  I'd love to see more incentive to complete the game with perhaps an achievment system of some sort or more of the occasional mid-level messages to add to the story.  If this stuff was developed, this title could certainly be better.\n\nHowever, despite its drawbacks, Dream Tale manages to score a positive review from me on the strength of its level design, and on the placement and implementation of the handful of powerups that aid your journey.  In this area, there was a little variety and challenge, and a few hard-to-reach areas or semi-hidden routes.  Do you go for the extra points, even if you're risking death?\n\nBottom line: I had an evening of fun with this title.  I'm not a high-score seeker, so I don't have much incentive to go back and play this again anytime soon.  If you're considering this title on its own merits, you could honestly find other titles that have more to offer.  However, if you're looking at this as a part of a bundle of some sort, well, then you might get a pleasant little suprise, as long as you aren't expecting more than 90 minutes of play at most.","March 2, 2015","true","3.5"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","1"

There's a lot of story to it, and the platforming starts to get really precise after the first few levels. It'll tug at your heart if you've ever had a dog, especially if that dog ever went missing.\n\nI can honestly say I would have paid more for this game than I actually did. It's super fun and and really charming, and gives a decent challenge.","February 4, 2015","true","0.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Also, she friendzoned a dog called Fyfo, and when one day he had understood his miserable situation and escaped from her, she sets on a quest of seeking for and returning him to his mistress' knees.\n\nOverall, Dream Tale is a super-cool platformer of Mario type (keys, scores, secrets etc.) that uses jumping and flying mechanics a lot. Also, it's quite challenging in the good sense of the word, and has nice visuals and sound. The more challenging it was, the more interested and involved I felt. But you need to seek for the secrets, hidden paths and so on to appreciate all its charm. Really great game.","August 23, 2015","true","12.0"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

A very nice original mechanic early on is a red star that somehow charges your ability to float for a short while; the charge is used up by using it, and you can't jump while it's active, so you need to figure out how to get to where you want to use it, and you need to learn how to use it just enough so it'll last just long enough -- and if it doesn't, you usually fall out of the screen and have to start over.\n\nIt's really fun to play, and if it isn't as long as some others, it isn't as expensive either. Recommended.","July 21, 2015","true","1.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I was surprised that with such a simple concept I was hooked in discovering all of the gameâ€™s secrets. A neat touch is that you can revisit the levels you beat but I feel like this game would have benefitted with a time attack mode where you compete with others time completion, which would have increased its replay ability. Also, it needed more levels as 20 levels just wasn't enough as there were design ideas that were screaming to be repeated due to the sheer joy of accomplishing them.\n\nKeep this one close to set a bar of quality for future platformers to come. They should not fall behind this game.\n","August 15, 2015","true","2.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This platformer suffers for it's week level design and mushy controls creating a sluggish tedium that prevents it from being fully enjoyable.\n\nWaiting for enemies to slowly path around to find openings bog down the momentum.  Inconsistent level design leads to many often fatal blind jumps.","March 10","false","0.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The puzzles range from mindlessly simplistic to being based on instant reflexes and defeating the point of being a puzzle based game to begin with, as well as just being tedious. The platforming is otherwise very simplistic and the game will likely be over in under the 2 hour refund limit, but it still isn't really worth it.","April 16","false","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
