While Spaceforce Captains was a buggy and badly thought out 'in space!' take on the Heroes of Might and Magic series (not just a game set in the same genre, but literally HoMM4 with the serial numbers philed off and set in space), this game doesn't rip off any specific pre-existing games and still fails to do anything new or original.\n\nIf you do still feel tempted to buy and play this, allow me to give you a preview of what your experience will be like: Use abilities (which are all name in german, because proper translation would've required effort and nothing in this game has any effort behind it) to kill enemy, play minigame to recoup resources expended on abilities, rinse, repeat ad nauseam.\n\nIn short: Avoid this like the plague.","December 13, 2013","false","0.1"," 199 of 223 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","199","223","2","0"

With no option to learn new technology, upgrade your ships or explore the galaxy in a non-linear fashion this game is lacking in any sort of depths.\nIt seems to clock in around 4 hours of gameplay and with no real options to mange your fleet could not recommend getting this unless it's cheaper.","December 14, 2013","false","3.5"," 73 of 80 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","73","80","0","0"

It is missing the typical tutorial to get you started with the game.  Also missing much of the mechanics to make this an enjoyable experience.

Turn-based space combat...what can go wrong?\n\nThe reality is that the gameplay is extremely repetitive, with no customization, no real strategy, no tactical options, and no depth whatsoever.\n\nThe concepts employed here would make for a solid hex-style board game, but for a video game, they fall painfully flat. There is no tutorial of any kind to introduce the player to the game-world (leaving the player immediately immersed in a two-dimensional unbranded universe), with the occasionally commentary scene provided as pure filler. The little snippets of story mean absolutely nothing in the experience of gameplay.\n\n....Getting down to the mechanics, under this thin veneer of a unique game-universe... The regular combat structure lacks any imagination, with just three basic combat techniques (lasers, missles, and AoE missiles) and a handful of special options. The mini-game required to aquire the crystals used for the special attacks grow old fast and are not worth the time or effort. The mothership battle card-based minigame is completely random and a defeat doesn't actually end the game---It really doesn't make much sense.... nor does the "search for life" mini-game, which has the same mechanics as the crystal hunting mini-game and no impact on the game itself. All of the mechanics of these gameplay elements are filler-pieces.\n\nI've been very disappointed by PC sci-fi games in general... for the past 18 months, high-end "finished projects" were released in less-than-beta state (i.e. Sword of the Stars II---which to K and his team, was meticulously repaired and improved over the course of the following year), not to mention the painfully incomplete Legends of Pegasus, which set a new low for sci-fi titles (and bankrupted the studio which produced it). Spaceforce Constellations, sadly, is clearly a complete product (unlike the other aforementioned bombs), and it does actually work---no bugs, no hangups, no crashes, no leaks... but the complete product is a mono-dimensional waste of time---and in full 1920 HD, the combat scenes looks terrible.\n\nAs another commenter suggested, if this game were to be flushed extensively with variety----ship design options, ship equipment options to change both ship aesthetics and functional load-outs, a research tree to develop new equipment with which to customize those ships, and actual decision-moments in the game to shape the direction and outcome of this incredibly generic story (i.e. developing alliances with multiple plot-directions), perhaps this could be evolved into an experience worth playing. Such advancements would require a lot of effort and still might not be worth the price of a latte and chicken nuggets, unless the constellation-filler became more substantial than the mechanically separated chicken preferred by McDonalds for their tastey treats.\n\n\n(If this developer has any sense, they would slim the game down and release it for free as a flash game. On the other hand, I've played better flash games than this.)","December 21, 2013","false","1.1"," 40 of 44 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","40","44","0","0"
