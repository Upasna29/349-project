I put over 40 hours into this game and I did all the side quests.\n\nI can't recommend anyone else do the same. And I got this for about $10 with the bank heist DLC. http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970398622/recommended/239160 covers most of what I think, so I'll just append to those thoughts here:\n\nThe Thief series is fundamentally a game about hiding in shadows and moving quietly to avoid being detected by enemies for which you yourself often hear first before seeing them. I've played every Thief game and that statement is axiomatic, fan-patched or not. The problem with Thief 4, as I will refer to it, is that the game's sound engine isn't properly coded and being fully in shadow (as denoted by the light gem and screen border indicators) doesn't meaningfully translate to "enemies are unable to see you at distance."\n\nYou may be walking along and suddenly hear footsteps or someone speaking quite loudly to your right, as though they were inches away. You turn, and there's nothing...because the person is actually on a separate floor, in another room, or across the street. You can't reliably use sound to determine "there's someone moving from that direction...and they're getting closer/further away" in this game, especially when it comes to overheard conversations.\n\nYou can be crouched down in full shadow, and a guard/civilian walking past may still be alerted to your presence upon walking by. Or not. Because of the inconsistent application of "the rules" your success or failure is based less upon your own player skill at stealth games (I'm no Lytha, but I consider myself competent) than your ability to predict the path the designers insist you take. You don't actually have much in the way of multiple solutions.\n\nThis has NOTHING to do with any individual's CPU, GPU, or speaker setup.\n\nYou can manually swing your blackjack, but it generally won't do you much good. You can't really thwack a surface to distract a guard, and if you try to manually swing it to KO someone it won't work. Nope, you've GOT to use the context-sensitive cinematic takedown button. Sometimes you can kill or knock out one guard (in this game there is absolutely no functional difference between the two outside of some arbitrary challenges) and the guard mere footsteps away detects nothing. Other times you do so and someone several feet away is alarmed. Aside from "broken glass" there is no difference in sound between moving on carpet vs moving on stone, wood, tile, etc so you'll spend most of the game crouch-walking with your hands mimicking the tiny arms of a Tyrannosaurus Rex.\n\nI do at least appreciate that you can see your hands and feet, and your picking up of loot items is animated. That makes it seem like you're really in the world. But nearly all of the stuff you steal is below your "master thief" calling. Ink bottles? Pens? Ashtrays? Common silverware? Once you start asking "wait, why are coin purses in bird's nests?" and "if everyone's starving and in poverty, why is this shiny gold ring literally lying on the ground in the street near these beggars?" you can't help but notice that the big unruly mob there to witness the latest hanging--frequently overheard as the only entertainment left to see--consists literally of two people.\n\nThief 4's story, setting, characters, and dialogue isn't even in the same league as the prior Thief games, such that during the moments in this one where they tried to reference / tie-in the old mythology to this my reaction was "game, you haven't earned the right to reference Keepers/Hammerites/Pagans." The writing isn't even in the same league as Assassin's Creed or Dishonored, the two games they were really, really trying to emulate here more than anything else. I think the only Thief game they really looked at was Deadly Shadows, but I don't think they learned from its missteps.\n\n"How was I seen just now?" is what you will often wonder. "Why am I not able to jump/climb onto this when I was able to jump/climb onto something just like it?" is another frequent question. The answer to both is the same: "unlike last time, the developers didn't want you to do that THIS time." You are at least powerful enough to be able to easily dispatch multiple guards at once if detected. Only one enemy type in the game is a true threat for which you can't fight head-on, and that's when the capriciousness of the stealth mechanics become particularly noticeable.\n\nDon't believe me? Demand proof? Then don't just watch one guy's video playthrough. Watch three. Watch four. Note how they all more or less have to do the same thing the same way, especially during the scripted "you've been spotted and have to escape" moments. I understand the need to reboot old series to be more accessible to new generations of fans. But if you're going to do that, at least do it well like Deus Ex: Human Revolution did. After that game, I had so much hope for Thief 4. But in the end, I got a poorly written game with awful characters and a nonexistent ending with gameplay that could've been acceptable with just a little more effort.","June 22, 2014","false","42.5"," 592 of 665 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","592","665","0","16"

Picture an Emo Goth Garret, complete w/ eye shadow and dour expressions, who spends his days sulking alone in an abandoned clocktower listening to 'My Chemical Romance' and writing bad poetry:  "The clocktower of bleakness ticks a song for the black sadness of my existence.  I'm so alone and no one gets me." until a crow comes to guide him to do things.  Yup.\n\nGarret is no longer just a Master Thief.  He's also Batman.  Instead of simply running from shadow to shadow, he now "swoops".  Instead of simply knocking some jerks out w/ a blackjack, now Garret beats the living snot out of them in a "takedown".  He can also do beat-downs-from-above ala Batman.   And like Batman he has a code:  No killing.  Well....  sorta.  Not really.  Depends on his mood, apparently.  He even has a "It's not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me" moment.  They should have just called it:  Batman - The Dark Victorian Knight\n\nWe can't talk about Garret without talking about loot.  You'll spend half the game collecting scissors, gears and syringes.  I kid you not.  You'll also find valuables that are "collectable".  These are unique and gaudy (profitable!) items that instead of selling them for a fat payday you'll instead decorate your clocktower with.  Did I mention they destroyed the very heart of Garret's character?  There is actually a moment when he's told by his fence, Basso, that he doesn't have to go risk his neck to break into a  safe that may or may not have something in it, because there's no job and he's not getting paid.  Garret's response:  "It's not about the payment, it's what I do."  *sigh*\n\nThe game begins w/ you on a job w/ a reckless young Thief that you taught - a little brat named Erin.  Torturous dialogue whenever she appears in the game.  It's painful.  Fair warning:  The writing is bad and the story is atrocious.  It's like they went to a community college Amateur Writing class and found Stephenie Meyer and James Gunn there and hired them.  Erin is the all-in-one female character:  comrade, emotional foil, damsel-in-distress, antagonist.\n\nRemember all the things you love about the original Thief games:  complex maps w/ multiple routes to success, Garret's snark and sense of humor, overhearing Benny the guard, Pagans and their dialect, Hammerites w/ their inquisition-style religious fanaticism, Mechanists and their lispy leader, Keepers and their Swedish brand of neutrality, Mages and their weird echoey mantras, gas-spewing burricks, undead, bugbeasts, spiders, craymen,  ratmen, exploding frogs, swimming, flooring that gave you away, mission briefings, cutscenes neatly happening before or after a mission, the euphamistic word "Taffer"....  it's all gone!  Garret is now just a humorless prick in a city of humorless ♥♥♥♥♥♥.  The game does, for some reason, retain vestiges of Thief lore that it otherwise doesn't bother with.\n\nErin has a spiky club she calls "the claw" that she made.  The game goes out of it's way to make a big deal about it.  Garret tells her the claw is holding her back - that it's loud and she doesn't need it.  Pretty soon Garret has possession of it and guess what?  Turns out he loves it!  This despite the fact he has a grappling hook he could use, but for some reason almost never ever does.  And thank goodness that the architects of the city thought to put strategically placed ugly metal grates wherever you need to climb to.  Lucky that!\n\nWherein the first 3 Thief games you used a blackjack to club people over the head and knockout; now you use it to bash people in the eye during takedowns and as your weapon of choice when going toe-to-toe with sword-weilding guards.  You heard me.\n\nThe lightgem was simple and elegant.  So they borked it and added a terrible "shroud" effect to the system, because... well... they hate us, or never played the original games.\n\nThis entry sees the return of the rope arrow, but unfortunately you can only use them in predetermined areas.  Also, you can't retrieve them.  That's okay though, because the game is linear and the joy of exploring is absent anyway!  Speaking of arrows:  you get 3 variants of the plain arrow, one water, one fire, one explosive, and one called choke.  Why they felt we needed 3 plain arrows and 2 incendiary, but no moss or gas arrows is puzzling.  Why even bother having the rope arrow when Garret has a grappling hook?  A tool you only see him use in cutscenes and a couple times during the scripted console-boy climbing sequences.  These sequences, btw, are pointless.  There is no gameplay actually happening - you simply follow a series of pipes and grates to your destination.  There are no puzzles or enemies to worry about - it's like they threw them in just to be able to tick off a checklist.\n\nThe item system:  new items include wire snippers to disarm traps, a pry bar to open windows, and a wrench to open vents.  Arrows don't have their own world model and instead are represented in game by what looks like a bagged lunch.  You can pick up food, but it also looks like a bagged lunch instead of, ya know, food.  Oh, and Opium.  Garret takes Opium.  It helps him "focus".  That's a great message for the kids, huh?\n\nItems can be found, but they can also be bought.  I thought it funny to find the merchant from Resident Evil 4 moonlighting here as a guy dressed like a flasher eager to show off his goods.  The merchant also lets you upgrade your skills via special items.  Yes, they've RPG-ified a game that in no way needed to be RPG-ified.\n\nYou can no longer jump or mantle wherever you'd like, assumingly because the developers are massive d**Kheads.  You're going to hate going through windows by the end of the game.  You pry open a window, climb in, once inside you turn around - window is closed and you have to do it all over again to get out.  Going through vent grates is also annoying.  Opening drawer after drawer in a dwelling may be tedious, but even worse is this new peek mechanic which you will accidentally engage when searching for items in desks and cabinets.  The developers thought Thief gamers had it too good with simple lean keys, so now we have to press a key (the same key used for just about everything else) that causes you to become glued to corners of walls and furniture until you press a separate release button.  Pointless mechanic.  Speaking of pointless:  the game now has quicktime events.  Going through a window, squeezing through a narrow space, and certain sections of game involve a bit of button mashing.  FOR NO REASON.\n\nThe graphics are lovely, if you enjoy the black-on-grey Tim Burton motif in EVERY single map.  The sound is abhorrent.  You will hear guys from across a room like they are right next to you, and yes this will drown out some cutscene dialogue.  Forget about the glory days of having to lean against doors to hear what's in the next room - standing in the road a ways down the street is just as good.  My favorite sound issue is when dialogue from an NPC isn't finished before they start talking about something completely different.  The lighting system is also flakey.  I've been spotted in pitch black - and I've seen enemies find bodies hidden away in the shadows like they were clear as day.  The AI is just as broken - sometimes they'll get stuck in place and refuse to do anything more.  I've had numerous "daydreaming" AI encounters that would make ghosting a mission imposssible.  The missions are mostly linear romps with singular paths and they all contain story cutscenes or action sequences, because nothing says "immersion" like having control of the character taken away from the player.  Oh, good luck navigating the City hub - I can't imagine anyone living in such a crazy circuitous mess.\n\nGood Lord, I could go on.  It's just awful.","February 26, 2015","false","46.3"," 675 of 783 people (86%) found this review helpful 177 people found this review funny","86","675","783","177","16"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xonikz/recommended/239160/","Xonikz","Xonikz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xonikz/","285 products in account","I just finished the game and am left wondering what happened during the concept and development phase that led to this blob of a game.\n\nI played 1,2 and 3 as they came out, before gold versions, or Steam, or any other modern game enhancement. Sure the original character backstory story was sparse, but the character didn't need to have a convoluted back story to be cool.\n\nI'm really confused as to why the writers felt it was necessary to create a whole new "broken home/brothers at odds/apprentice lover kidnapped" back story for Garrett when his original "orphan trained as a keeper turned top tier taffer hated by all factions" story was much more interesting.  None of the original world was even a part of this new game. I played on the hardest mode possible, shut off all visual helps (why those existed, I'll never understand), and took my sweet time to play through without killing everyone. I never felt the need to ghost every level in the original games and so I tried to play this in the same way (adventurer style). At the end of this new Thief, though, I was left with three glaring issues beyond the fluffy console gamer additives. Also, why was his jumping and swimming ability stolen from Garret?\n\n1: The music in the game pulled me out of the supspension of disbelief, so I shut it off. The original games had music in the title, the catacombs, the credits and one or two other atmospheric interludes, but never did it have a full-running, repeating, battle-themed score. I felt the score was an addition that cheapened the gameplay at the expense of production money.\n\n2: The addition of ultra vulgar curse words, nudity, and sexually themed conversations was stupid. Never did a player of the original games say to themselves, "gosh, I wish their were topless chicks in this game that said the F- word all the time and performed BDSM themed scripted actions when I peered through a keyhole." Instead we all focused on stealing loot and not getting caught by guards, zombies, and ratmen. I miss the ratmen and bug creatures BTW. Cut the "real words" vulgarity and make your scripting less vulgar. BTW, why was "Taffer" dropped? I loved that euphamism.\n\n3: Stop trying to make partial RPGs out of single player action games. Each level needs clear singular goals that drive profit or plot. Explain and answer all the plot points by end of the game. Start each level with a store for getting gear purchased with previous leveling loot cash. Eliminate the "wandering through town in search of random side quests and loot" bit. Bring back the storybook cutscenes between levels to drive the story. And, for the love of Pete, stop trying to make up a new origin story and faction rules for a world that already existed. The Hammers, Keepers, Zombies, Ghost Priests, Mechanists, Pagans, Ancients, bug people, ratmen, etc had more believeability and intriguing conceptualization than any of the crappy angry mobs and homeless people in this new iteration... Grrrr Arrrgh.\n\nPlayed, finished, sad, uninstalled.\nThere is no replay factor in this game for me. Replay should be story driven; not multiplayer, stupid goals, and trinkets driven. I wouldn't watch a movie over and over again if its story sucked, and single player games are the same kind of entertainment for me. Make the story interesting and I'll play it again and again and again, because I love the story. I would also recommend it, if I loved the story. I recommend Thief 1 and 2 very highly.\n\nI wish someone could take the original gameplay from 1 and 2, the original cutscenes, voice acting, footstep sounds, and story lines; and put them into this beautifully rendered game engine. That would be the coolest thing that could possibly happen to the Thief franchise at this point.\n\nMake it and expansion pack and I'd pay for the stories all over again. Just don't kill an existing fanbase with crap like this ever again.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PirateCaptainDark/recommended/239160/","PirateCaptainDark","PirateCaptainDark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PirateCaptainDark/","657 products in account","Back in the day when other games encouraged players to shoot everything in sight, there was one game that challenged the standard. This game gave players freedom while also introducing them to a world where the faith of people lay in machinery and magic. Thief: The Dark Project also introduced us to the Master Thief, Garrett – who would go on to win our hearts not through brute force but through his cunning nature. I don’t know how to say the following without it coming across as rude. EVERYTHING that we loved about Thief has been, literally and figuratively, buried deep in the cold, hard ground. This review is meant for the players who have decided to make this their first Thief game – if you take anything from this review, let it be this: this is NOT what Thief games are about.\n\nLevel Design: The city appears so spacious and lively at first glimpse. Don’t be fooled. In order to finish the main storyline, the game requires that you traverse through the same paths on MULTIPLE occasions in order to get to the next chapter. The city and areas connected to it feature gateways (like windows and narrow crawlspaces) that involve constant button mashing to unlock and pass. This feature alone becomes frustrating once you realize it is located around every corner. The chapters occasionally offer different paths inside a target building but eventually all paths will converge to the same endpoint in a chapter. Pointless in a game where if you want 100% of the loot, you will cover every nook and cranny. The city which was initially introduced as being lively eventually just ends up being the same guards (either City Watch or Graven) on patrol and the same civilian (albeit different model) who happens to walk around examining Builder knows what. Oh right, and the many homeless people who never interact with the protagonist in any way.\n\nAudio and Music: You would think for a stealth game, the audio would be a must! Conversations can sound muffled from one person and not the other, despite being the same distance apart – even among main characters. Conversations from guards overlap and repeat every so often and might even get stuck on a neverending cycle. Oh and nobody says “TAFFER” anymore! It’s so disheartening to hear someone just blatantly say “f**k” (wow, so edgy!) I miss the days of quality banter between the drunken guards. The surface you choose to traverse across doesn’t matter because it all makes the same noise to the enemy depending on your proximity to them. All that matters is that you slowly creep and the enemies won’t know a thing. The only time the music AND audio ever stood out was during the spooky haunted asylum mission. (nod of approval for the audio based safe combination) But most of the time, the music just interferes with your ability to listen to FOOTSTEPS and NOISES.\n\nCharacter Design: Garrett doesn’t have his Mechanical Eye anymore. Instead, he has another eye ability which he doesn’t ever question until someone else points it out. Not like it ever matters because that still doesn’t explain why his new eye is capable of highlighting all loot and interactive objects within sight. (See also: Easy Mode) Furthermore, everyone in this game talks (non-stop) through clichés. Garrett used to have amazing dialogue but now just uses any opportunity he gets to point out the obvious. As for his protégé, Erin; they kept reusing her lines over and over in what seems like dream sequences. Dream sequences that you can’t skip. Last but not least, I must cover the most stereotypical villain of all time: The Thief-Taker General! (Great name by the way) This scumbag will show up more often than Team Rocket to make sure he captures Garrett in the most inefficient manner possible. Please never do this again.\n\nGame Mechanics: Where do I start? When you map keys, don’t map similar ones to the same action. The same key that’s used to open a drawer, is also used to peek around the corner. This leads to frustrating situations. Then there’s the arrows. Oh thank the Trickster God that the rope arrow is back! What’s that, you say that you can only use them on certain designated spots? And if you ever miss with arrows, you can’t salvage them? Curse thee, O’Trickster Lord! In addition, the blackjack knocks people out using a long, drawn out scene – just in case anyone wants to take a picture. If you ever decide to collect 100% loot, don’t start thinking that the hub will display your current amount! Nah, you better get well acquainted with the F1 key and the game’s menu screen. That reminds me, the overworld map is very unconventional and inefficient; often zooming in as far as possible on your current room. Great, I’m in a moderately-sized rectangular-shaped room. What's the point? Last but not least, this game holds your hand from the moment you start to the very end. If using focus wasn’t enough, Garrett also feels the need to mention your current objective via dialogue.\n\nStory: You know those blogs that say “Welcome to my Twisted Mind”? This game’s story looks like it was entirely written by people running such blogs. This story is so simple and bland, I'm surprised it was ever approved. While I’m at it, why does one of the Chapters have you sneak through a brothel? Who thought “Hey, I know what a Thief game needs: Pr0stitutes!” If it’s not too much to ask, please keep the smut in fan-fictions and out of future Thief games. Let me wrap this up without spoiling too much. This game’s story makes very little sense to me – they want to usher in an era of progress and industrialism by holding a magical ceremony which corrupts the minds and bodies of humans?\n\nConcluding Remarks: This game takes elements from other games and tries to make Garrett something that he was never meant to be: a Steampunk Batman. There needs to be more of a focus on the stealth side and less on the quicktime events and action sequences. Give players back the freedom to interact with their environments and choose their own path towards multiple endpoints. Fix the glitches and get rid of transition points and LONG loading screens. If you want to reboot the Thief series, that is completely FINE! But don’t erase everything that made it special. The Hammerites, the Pagans and the Keepers all contributed to Garrett’s development. My hope is that Thief will see another game in the franchise; one which develops Garrett’s origin story. This game will take us through his life; meeting Artemus, training with the Keepers, his eventual return to a life of thievery and finally it ends with the events preluding the Dark Project. Show us how he became a MASTER THIEF! It also would not hurt to have him be voiced by the talented Stephen Russell. This game is not bad as a standalone title, but it’s not a Thief game. Therefore, I give this game a score of 5/10.","September 24, 2015","false","90.1"," 544 of 661 people (82%) found this review helpful 48 people found this review funny","82","544","661","48","32"

But compared to Thief remake, Dishonored is a masterpiece. And the sad thing is, Thief is totally playable, solid game - but slightly annoying in all possible ways, and also completely ridiculous. Slightly amusing TL;DR next.\n\nThief is not a horrible game - rather, it's quite mediocre, despite all of the evident labor that went into its making. The source of the most excrutiating pain is the game's plot: it's all incredibly half-baked, illogical twists and baffling characters who are all over the place. Yes, including Garrett, who is part action-star jock (delivering one-liners in the most inappropriate situations), and part piece of wood, that chooses all the worst moments to insert a meaningful silence (so they all look like bug-eyed weirdness). All in all, Garrett reminded me of Shia LaBoeuf, which is Eldritch enough in itself. I won't even get into the game's half-♥♥♥♥♥ attempt at political commentary, because it's clearly pulled straight from other movies and games without any thought. Dialogue is simply very bad (though overheard "flavor" conversations are perfectly OK). For me, the highlight of writer's craft  was when chief of criminal police explained to a notorious thief the meaning of the ubiqitous in-game word meaning "thief" (along the lines of "You see, when they catch thieves, they scald their hand in tar, so thieves are often called blackhands. Did you know that?") The ending is so muddled and confounding, it's almost high-art surreal.\n\nOK, let's disregard the plot (and we can, literally, since there are several nice little, interesting side missions to play). Game mechanics (like the plot) is a smorgasbord of Dishonored, Hitman: Absolution, Assassin's Creed and others. Each one contributes a lovely bit of gameplay - and almost all of these bits don't work. Including the bits from original Thief. For example, Absolution-style closets for hiding are so completely useless, developers made them double as save points. I beat the game on Master using stealth, and I used the cabinet for hiding once. And I could do without it that time. And you can save anytime anyway.\n\nStealth is not very good: on one hand, enemies are deaf and dumb, on the other, there are only two lighting situations for the player: brightly lit and totally obscured by darkness. The end result looks rather ridiculous, player prancing around people, snatching earrings out of their earlobes and cups before their eyes, hiding behind a coffee table in a lit room, hiding in plain sight in the middle of the stairs and so on. Another example of (Dishonored-)pulled mechanic is the Swoop - a cool accelerated stealth motion that is almost silent for some reason. Again, it's sometimes cool, but it undermines the tension and calculations of stealth: if there is a danger of detection, you just swoop around enemies like a terrified jetbike caught in hostile waters.\n\nClose combat leaves you feeling like an idiot: to make Garrett more thievy, they denied him the use of any edged weapons, so even if you make a tough moral decision to murder the guy who discovered you, you will have to hit him repeatedly with a small club until he is too tired to block. Yes, I'm not joking, it's the only kung fu in Garrett's arsenal.\n\nOpen-world navigation is incredibly infuriating. In attempt to make the (very small) town into kind of a puzzle, developers closed off 90% of the roofs and plotted extremely arbitrary and convoluted paths, without any consideration for how the hell could anyone live in this city at all. And where is everybody. The "overheard conversations" mechanic always works as disembodied voices from inaccessible Nowhere, SOMETIMES EVEN IF THE CONVERSATION IS INSIDE THE APARTMENT YOU'RE IN. And it glitches sometimes, so you hear the same chat about a nice-smelling sex-worker all over the level, like it's a ghost that haunts your undersexed thieving self. Apartments that you rob, meanwhile, are always ominously empty. The nail in the coffin is arbitrary window-portals and "narrow-passage-portals" between maps, that never tell you where are you going. They're slow, annoying, and for all of their lengthy animations, they still end up showing you a loading screen.\n\nAnd several hours into the game, you realize that you're stealing everything from everyone, from lowly vagrants to artistic types to dead people to nobility. That's because neither Garrett or the game itself do not differentiate. For them, it's like collecting rings in Sonic.\n\nOh, and Garrett can't jump. It's OK as a design choice, there are a lots of designated climbing points... but Garrett also can't jump over small and deadly pressure plates. He just expires, raising his hands in despair (that's his dying animation, for some reason).\n\nAnyway, it all comes down to the plot. You could gladly trod though not-so-perfect-but-totally-OK gameplay if you didn't roll your eyes every half an hour, or if any of the NPC's caused f***-giving counter to show of the myriad readings not amounting to zero. I certainly trodded through Thief all the same, and went away with something to tell - like the SUDDEN Silent Hill revival in the mental institution, or the need to set up precise soft flesh headshots, or cool side missions, or the HONESTLY COOL peripheral/central vision stealth mechanic (when enemies' reaction time depends on how peripheral you are to their vision cone). I have the utmost respect to its developers who churned out this enormous amount of content and threw in a couple of good ideas.\n\nThere is a lot of things in Thief, and many of them are righteous. But the demonic side won.\n\n***I should clarify, after reading other reviews, that there are many smart bits about new Thief's stealth. Detection of open containers, peripheral vision, multi-level alert, cumulative alert and so on. At the same time I should add that the game world (which is part of the plot, so it's covered in the review) is not very convincing. It's 1920's (or later) technology, household items, fashion and overall aesthetics in a sorta medieval world. Rachmaninov playing on voxophones but lighting with torches. Wirecutters that cut rope.

It's a massive, generous game that plays like it was rushed out the door. When it works, it can be enjoyable but it has too many bugs, design flaws and questionable decisions to recommend to anyone but the most desperate of stealth fans.\n\nThief is a broken, tragic, rewritten mess of a game. The plot has clearly been reworked multiple times. The Baron and Orion standing in for the Mechanists and Pagans respectively, is fine on paper but it doesn't work in execution. Since they have barely any screen time, they have to scream their motivations to the player in an awkward, rushed manner. Erin feels like a holdover from an earlier iteration of the game, when it was a straight sequel to Deadly Shadows.\n\nThe Thief Taker General is hilarious. I love it when he happens to find Garrett, who has just returned from a trek through a long forgotten ruin, underneath his bed at the brothel. I like the idea of Garrett having an antagonist but TTG is just awful; a bald, mustachioed villain who walks with a limp, drops f-bombs, kills his underlings over trivial matters (so you know he's bad!) and has a crossbow affixed to his arm. There's way too much going on here. He feels like a one of the grotesque characters from Hitman: Absolution. Why Eidos Montreal thought he would be a good choice for the Thief universe is baffling.\n\nThe sound-mixing is atrocious. The worst I've ever heard in any AAA game. That's not hyperbole. It's broken. Sound cuts out frequently, guards across a courtyard sound like their yelling into the players ear, npcs yell ambient dialogue over Basso repeatedly during cutscenes, and Garrett's voice actor frequently pauses to his read lines. The lip-syncing is horrid. I really miss the sound propagation from the earlier titles. Unless you're walking on glass or water, it's doesn't matter where you walk, Garrett won't make a sound.\n\nThere are some really cool additions including blunt arrows (must-have for all future Thief games), some instances of impressive a.i. (noticing open safes, lights switching off etc...), knocking over bottles, real-world alarms (birds, dogs), the lockpicking game making a noise when you fail. It's quite enjoyable, but not without reservations. Some of the best parts of the game are undermined by, I suspect, poor play testing. For instance, after cracking a safe in tailors shop, Garrett refused to stop examining the silly earring I just nabbed. The animation was unskippable, so when the guard rounded the corner, I didn't have time to shut the safe, and he went on alert. Not cool.\n\nWhile the city looks gorgeous, its pretty much empty. The sidequests are neat, but most of the time I'm just exploring an vacant apartment; no one's home. If I mess up the lockpicking or set off a trap 9 times out of 10 it doesn't matter since it's empty. All these cool additions to the game are underused. Also, there's so many loading zones! Enter a one room apartment. Pick up a letter opener and a ring. Leave in under 20 seconds. Load for just as much. This content just slows the game down. Then there's a lack of abilities and gadgets. I like Swoop, but it's basically a grounded Blink and the rest of Garrett's abilities are essentially uniquely skinned door-openers.\n\nGarrett's movement has a nice heft to it. He feels present. But moving through the world is about working out exactly what the designer wants you to do, not using your instincts or experimenting. If a rope arrow is just out of reach, don't bother trying to grab it. You need to look for a crate, or a ladder or a walk way to reach it. It's a discrete puzzle that was made for that specific instance. I wish it was like Assassin's Creed or Mirror's Edge. Instead it's an awkward compromise that isn't very enjoyable. Unlike Dishonored, where the designers have a set of rules that you can rely upon, Thief is about instances. These guards will patrol in this pattern no matter what. This object can be leaned around, while another identical object cannot. You can climb this crate, but not this one.\n\nIt's such a frustrating game! It doesn't have the same love Eidos Montreal had for Deus Ex. That team got the brand. Thief doesn't play like the rest of the series. That's fine. It's been a decade since Deadly Shadows. Time moves on. But Dishonored is Thief's competition and that game, as a stealth adventure, did a better job in every respect of capturing the essence of Thief. Thief plays like it was made in 18 months. It simply wasn't ready. I hope they get the opportunity to take a long look at what happened here, evaluate and take another stab at the licence.","November 27, 2014","false","24.6"," 500 of 624 people (80%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","80","500","624","12","8"

I can't imagine how disappointed a loyal fan of the series could be.\n\nUnderwhelming and boringGoes to show graphics aren't everything in a game.\n\n✓ Great graphics\n✓ Good voice acting\n✓ Nice stealth mechanics\n✓ Plenty of collectibles and challenges\n✓ It lives up to its name, STEAL ALL THE THINGS!\n\n✗ Mediocre gameplay\n✗ As linear as it gets\n✗ Crappy story\n✗ Very dumbed down for consoles\n✗ Full of hand-holding\n✗ Combat sucks\n✗ Although V.O. is good, the writing is BAD\n✗ Little to no room to explore\n✗ Overall a tryhard game\n\nPersonal thoughtsThis game is a mess. It's like dunkey said:\n\nOriginally posted by videogamedunkey:You know nowadays game developers, before they're even done developing the core game they wanna go out and add every single feature from every game they've ever seen.\n\nIt's like making a pizza and there's no cheese on it, but now they wanna go ahead and add mushrooms, then they're bringing on the spinach on there, uh... peruvian onions from like underground layer, sliced banana peppers... then they're bringing in some olives and like roast beef... ughh like mosquitoes...\n\n...and then you just have this abomination that nobody should eat and it costs $60.\nThief could've been such a fantastic stealth/stealing based game, but it's like that wasn't enough so they put some parkour gimmicks. It still wasn't enough so they shoved in a RPG like system (perks, puzzles and upgrades)... but they forgot about the combat. Dear god the combat system is SO bad you'll actively avoid being seen just so you don't have to caress the enemies with your blackjack. Did I mention that arrows are unlootable? You can only purchase them and you'll run out pretty fast, so forget about archery.\n\nThe missions are incredibly linear and they feel more like a chore as you progress. Every time you discover a new map there's this impressive aerial view of the place... it makes you think "so much room to discover!" but nope, it's all a small sandbox with some alternate routes to make you think there's strategy involved.\n\nAnd what's with all the illogical stuff throughout the game? Like why the hell does Garrett keep using the claw if he insults Erin for relying on it? Why is the city full of meshes and scratched wooden spots for me to escape? It's not like they're hidden... any guard can see them and it's pretty clear they're used by thieves.\n\nWhy do I keep the most valuable treasures instead of selling them and living the high life with my dirty money? Or moving to a city without a plague, for that matter. I could go on, but I think you get the idea. I really tried to like this game, I really tried, but I ended up getting bored.\n\nNoteworthy     If you want parkour, play Mirror's Edge\nIf you want stealth, play Dishonored\nIf you want an RPG, play SkyrimJust don't bother with Thief.","June 28, 2015","false","8.2"," 455 of 585 people (78%) found this review helpful 53 people found this review funny","78","455","585","53","28"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/recommended/239160/","TheManko","TheManko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/","409 products in account","It’s been a while since I played something as blatantly unfinished as Thief. At first the game appears reasonably well polished. But the further you get into the game you start noticing glaring issues with production values and design. I started out having a good time playing this, and in the second half of the game I was wishing it would just end.\n\nThe first three Thief games set the bar as far as sound design goes. Everything from the droning ambient sound and music to the sound of walking on surfaces and NPC dialogue was as good as it gets in games. This Thief is like a joke compared to them. First off it’s just not done to an acceptable level of polish. You will often not be able to hear voice over from Garrett because some ambient sound or music overpowers his voice. Sometimes his voice over is even cut off early by the game transitioning to a load screen. It’s also lacking in finesse even when it’s working normally, as you often can’t tell where guards are. If you’re inside a building someone walking out on the street will sound like he’s just beside you in the room. Elevation, walls and such don’t seem to matter to the sound engine. It’s a critical problem in a stealth game where you’re always listening intently to tell where guards are before you see them. When you can’t trust your ears it becomes hard to believe in the world as a real place. For example the surfaces you walk on barely matter in Thief. Instead of clanking noise on metal you don't notice it. Cobble stones are no different from thick carpet. In the old Thief games you could almost feel how the material felt, just by the sound it made when you stepped on it. Here it's all the same. Not only does it make it harder to believe in the world, but it also robs the game of an entire layer of strategic thinking while navigating.\n\nAnother issue with the game mechanics was the decision to ditch the old movement system, replacing it with the Assassin’s Creed system. So in order to run, jump, climb or vault object you hold down L2 (or the keyboard equivalent). The game decides for you which is the appropriate thing to do at the time. Over and over again this system did the opposite of what I wanted. Sometimes I wanted to stand on a ledge to get a better view of the environment, and instead Garrett leapt to his death, or vaulted right in front of a guard. Often I saw objects I thought I should be able to climb, but couldn’t. Or areas where I thought I should be able to jump down, but couldn’t because the ground below was uneven. This makes you feel constrained in what you can do. Especially later in the game when you’ve mastered all the basic game systems and would like to experiment with more inventive tactics. Many things in the game feel like the result of a hundred cooks meddling with the design and adding their own ideas. Presumably a faction of the Thief dev team pushed for Assassin’s Creed style navigation without realizing it meant robbing players of expression and ruining the endgame.\n\nWhat I found downright confusing in Thief was how bad the acting was. Most of the major characters like Garrett are fine. But far too much of the guard banter is embarrassing, like it was a fan dub instead of a professional release. The script doesn’t help, but in general the line delivery was shocking. The story as a whole hardly makes sense. A disease called the Gloom is terrorizing the city. But you don't see the effects of it in the game. I never had any clear idea what it was, how it manifested itself, or why anyone should care about it. It’s clear that the story was never finished in time. In the ending the last bit of gameplay cuts into a pre-rendered cutscene which doesn’t match what was happening in the scene at all. As if they were part of different revisions of the script, and they weren't allowed the time to bring them in sync. As it is now the ending feels like two halves of different scenes spliced together with no regard for continuity.\n\nThe signs that this wasn’t ready to ship are everywhere. You have a focus ability in the game which highlights objects and traps in the world. One might assume that this is intended as a help for novice players to navigate the world easier. But as it turns out the developers used it as a crutch to cut corners on level design. Some traps don’t have visual markers in the world and are only visible using focus. Interactive objects like rope arrow spots are almost impossible to spot without it. There’s a minimap in the game, which is also a must if you want to find the stores in the city to buy and sell upgrades. While playing Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2 I noticed they used player assists in a similar fashion. Not to help new players, but to prop up crappy unfinished designs to a level somewhat suitable for human consumption. I hope this isn’t a trend for the future of AAA games. I want thoughtful and well executed designs. Not some shambling wreck held together with tape and glue in the form of waypoints, minimaps and glowing highlights in the environment. Is it really that hard to do this right?\n\nDuring my first couple sessions I thought I would be able to recommend this as I was having a good time. Maybe get it when it’s cheap.","March 5, 2014","false","16.6"," 570 of 744 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","570","744","0","16"

A long-awaited sequel to the stealth franchise of the same name, this was the opportunity to allow powerful technologies to free the developers to make a compelling title full of the dense, interconncted levels the the original games were known for.\n\nVisually, the game is stunning, full of dark, moody environments and detailed characters.  The actual stealth mechanics work quite well, too. Creeping and peering around corners works well, and the enemy AI achieves the right balance of being observant, but not too frustrating to sneak around. As expected, you do quite a lot of stealing in the game, but whereas past titles simply had loot disappear when clicked on, your character's hands are now modeled to depict every action.  This tactile feel extends to other areas of interaction, as well.\n\nWhere the game fails, quite resoundingly, is in its narrow, unambitious level design. For all their visual splendor, the levels are almost always linear paths with few options.  Instead of the massive areas of past titles in the series, we get a succession of tiny rooms, and very often a small bit of progression blocks access to the previous area.  It's a transparent use of checkpointing, and it makes levels feel too artificial and as a result progressing through these areas doesn't give a strong sense of accomplishment. For a comparison, it would be best to try the original two Thief games (or some of the numerous fan missions that exceed the originals in quality) or even the recent Dishonored game to see how rewarding level design can be when it strives to create non-linear environemnts that feel like a functioning place.\n\nOn top of all this, the story/characters fall completely flat. The previous character actor of the series brought a cynical, worldweary, but still humorous take on Garrett, the protagonist.  Those dimensions are entirely lost here, and instead this Garrett, and the whole story, are entirely one-note: grim and dark.  At times this  morose tone seems to stretch into self-parody as the story takes ever sillier twists and turns.  I'd entirely stopped caring by the time I finished the game.","June 12, 2014","false","33.9"," 195 of 247 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","195","247","0","7"

Turns out, it doesn't matter.\n\nThe game starts off well enough with the jewelry store heist in the first chapter; picking locks and pockets is initially thrilling enough to get any kleptomaniac's heart racing. Eventually as the game progresses, it becomes evident that the NPC AI has been pared down to the point that sneaking around isn't much of a challenge.\n\nWhat is challenging though, is the way in which missions are replayed. Want to go back and play through a chapter to pick up that missed bit of loot? Well, forget about selecting the mission from the menu, you'll need to head back into the area in The City hub where the mission began. Hardly intuitive when there's no option for fast travel and the map is absolute rubbish.\n\nIn addition, the story is bland, and the characters aren't very engaging. There are issues with the sound, too, which ruin the atmosphere when you're trying to be quiet and you hear a loud voice, which must surely mean someone's in the room with you and you're about to be discovered. Nope, the person talking is outside. Across the road. In another building.\n\nOn a more positive note, the art design is great, the buildings and surroundings appear to be painstakingly crafted.  Sadly, this doesn't warrant purchasing a game, so I'd wait until there's a substantial discount. $5 and Thief would be a steal.","May 20, 2014","false","29.1"," 159 of 205 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","159","205","0","0"

From the bizarre controls, which require you to press a special key to drop down from certain places but only those, the fact that in order to climb a ladder you have to press the jump key rather than use, or the fact that you can't actually jump, just press the jump key near a ledge and Garret will decide if he wants to jump or not.\nThe annoying, long QTEs you have to do every single time you want to open a window (or to be specific, the same QTE repeated over and over again) don't help either, and the AI is serviceable though not even remotely good enough for a stealth game.\n\nI want to like Thief, mostly because the artists here put an incredible amount of love to the art, but the sub-par game design elements, lame story and overall lack of polish means that everytime I launched the game I minimized it at some point and started fooling around on the web completely forgetting the thing was even there, which is a first for me and hopefully the last.\n\nFor all of these reasons I can't recommend this game, at least not at full price.

But I also believe some of the excessive negativity that surrounds this game is exacerbated by an overly vocal group of “Debbie Downers.”  At the time of writing this: the data shows that more than two-out-of-three people who took time to review this game enjoyed it; but there are mostly negative reviews as the “most helpful” on the store page.  So it seems the people who disliked the game really want you to know about it, even though there is evidence that suggests that there are more people who liked it than who didn’t. And so this review may receive a load of critique by those who refuse to respect my opinion even though I’m able to respect theirs, but that is OK.  All I know for sure is that: I liked Thief.\n\nIs this game different from the early installments of the Thief franchise? Yes.  It has no doubt been modernized to appeal to a wider audience of gamers and not just the hardcore stealth fans (i.e.: it is easier).  Still, if you take the time to set up a custom difficulty, you can remove much of the “hand-holding” and make the game quite punishing.  Nevertheless, I can empathize with everyone who was let down by this game being too mainstream by default and not staying true to the established traditions.\n\nThief is semi-linear, undoubtedly, especially during the individual levels; although there is a decent amount of freedom to explore The City.  The thing is: you certainly won’t get stuck spending 3 hours lost in the sewers like you may have in the older games.  Thief is far less enigmatic than the earlier installments.  Some long term fans are upset by this, and you may be too— and that is your prerogative.  That said, there are also a lot of people who don’t want to spend a whole evening of gameplay being lost on one level in one game, especially if they only have a limited amount of hours of free time in which to play games.\n\nSo it is true that this game is quite different than the early editions in the franchise.  It does hold your hand in the default state (although you can turn off most assistance in the options and difficulty settings).  And it is rather linear.  You have every right to dislike that and dislike this game.  But maybe you are one of the many gamers who just wants to relax and play a game for a few hours after working all day.  Maybe you are looking to go on an intriguing adventure, want to be told a story, and don’t feel like getting lost or frustrated on the way.  Well then maybe you should give Thief a try.\n\nI felt the most captivating aspect of the game was the stellar atmosphere of the gameworld.  The ambiance is mysterious, violent, dark, and mystifying.  The high production value of the graphics and soundscape went a long way to reinforce the air of quality inherent to the game’s atmosphere.  Moreover, even if many other aspects failed, I thought the ambiance of the game stayed true to the established traditions of the franchise.\n\nThe narrative isn’t the most riveting piece of writing to grace the realm of video games, but it is mildly interesting and serves to give some purpose to the gameplay.  The gameplay itself is fun.  With the custom difficulty settings you really can take the driver’s seat in determining how casual or grueling of an experience you want.  The controls are smooth and intuitive, and there aren’t any painful flaws that will cause you to accidentally be spotted.\n\nThere are plenty of collectibles, secrets, and achievements if you are into that kind of thing.  There are also a large amount of sidequests which can really open up and expand the game if you choose to pursue them.\n\nThief is a pretty fun game, but certainly isn’t a masterpiece.  It is quite mainstream, and definitely has stepped out from the hardcore stealth realm of the earlier editions in the franchise.  If you just want to play a nice atmospheric game with a high production value and have some fun, you can definitely find that here.  If you want traditional hardcore Thief gameplay, you may be disappointed— although you may also want to consider trying the custom difficulty before you blindly dismiss it. It has some flaws and minor annoyances, but overall it can be a rather enjoyable experience. Regardless, this is definitely the type of game where you are going to have to determine your own preferences and decide if you want to try it or not.  All I know for sure is that: I liked Thief.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","December 20, 2015","true","24.1"," 328 of 456 people (72%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","72","328","456","27","12"

Travelling between the areas is a nightmare and quickly gets frustrating. The final nail in the coffin was how closed the world felt. It seems like 90% of all the doors and windows you cross cannot be opened and are basically invisible walls. You can only jump up on certain walls and fences.

I am new player, I have never played a Thief game before this so obviously I speak for the 2nd group of players. So far this game is very fun and unique among my game library. I am glad to see this game sticks to its guns and focuses on actual thievery and isnt combat such as Assassins Creed or Dishonored, fighting multiple enemys is suicide and stealth is always the best option. There is also the ability to customize the difficulty in any way that suits your playstyle to make it harder or easier, by chooseing harder settings boosts your score and rewards you for playing hardcore. Another feature I like seems to be similar to Splinter Cell, after a mission you receive a score based on three catagorys (Ghost, Predator, Opportunist). My only beef with this game so far is that its a little linear and the maps seem small compared to a game like Dishonored. Its just my preference, its nothing against the game. As long as a game maintains a strong story and good mechanics then being linear is fine, being a linear game seems like a bad thing these days and to me its just one method to telling a story.\n\nOn to the second part of this review.\n\nWhen I was reading reviews on metacritic today I noticed that about 90% of the negative reviews were about how "modern" it was or how it was a crappy addition to the series. Now I can understand why people might be disapointed in the direction a game might take but it doesnt make it right to give it a 0/10. Fact is that this is a quality game and plenty of effort was put into developing it, thats all I can ask for.\n\n","February 25, 2014","true","14.7"," 1,006 of 1,461 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","006","1","0","18"

I was sad to see that Thief does not have the same feel as the old games. The humor that you receive from listening to the guards talk is also gone. Citizens wandering around the city do not acknowledge you, giving them a lifeless feel. The story is not as good as the stories in the previous games as it feels less compelling than the Dark Project, the Metal Age and even Dark Prophecy. The new game is also missing some of its most dynamic parts. What happened to the Hammers? The Pagans? Not to mention the unique enemies you encountered in all the previous games (mechanist robots, pagan creatures, keeper statues, etc). You also have to watch Garrett steal and interact with everything as opposed to just taking things, this wouldn't be a problem except that it slows down your ability to stay out of sight of guards. The combat in this game is an improvement, but as the old Thief games were the birthplace of stealth games, combat never was a big focus in Thief, if you're being seen by guards then you're doing it wrong. Overall, the new Thief lacks the dynamic story and gameplay of the original. I give it a 6/10. If you didn't play the original games then you likely will enjoy the game for what it is.","February 26, 2014","false","35.6"," 1,381 of 2,044 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","381","2","0","37"

I gave it a fair chance, played completely through hoping it would get better, and that the story would finally hit its stride and start making sense.\n\nPros: Sneaking mechanics work well, and the 'swoop' ability can really make you feel like you own the shadows.  Wide variety of arrow types.  Visuals are generally very good.  Voice acting is solid. AI seems solid, in the usual lovable  sneaker-amnesiac sort of way.\n\nCons:\nSneaking works well, when the level designers actually let you use it, which isn't often. There may be multiple paths around the city, but they are few and feel like linear A=>B tunnels.  You will constantly be frustrated by the sheer amound of things Garrett can't or won't climb, or won't walk through, or mantle over, etc.\nThe story makes almost no sense. Most of the time when a cutscene started, I would find myself asking "How the crap did that just happen? And when it ended, I'd be wondering what the crap just happened.  It feels very disjointed, to say the least. Characters pop in and out, changing roles with the spastic plot twists.\nSpeaking of characters popping in... it's downright embarrasing just how many times our hero gets jumped by a balding old creep with a walking stick and a limp. Seriously Garrett, they call you the Master Thief; you sneak up on people for a living. You'd think some of that experience would bleed over into the cutscenes, but no.  I threw up my hands more than once because I could see what was coming a mile away and Garrett was still completely oblivious.\nAnd even the final chapter left me with little resolution or warm fuzzies, so I can't recommend this to anyone, really.  Go play Dishonored instead.\n\nAs a final note, there's one mission that has some fairly explicit adult content that you *must* witness to completed the mission, so take that as you will.","October 15, 2014","false","51.9"," 161 of 219 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","161","219","3","0"

Scenery looks phenomenal and the sense of dampness, filth, lighting, and props lend a lot toward immersion. Weaponry, though limited, is interesting. Sneaking around is quite fun.\n\nCons: Linear, closed world. Narrow, almost claustrophobic corridor for exploration. Climbing tools are made available and fun to use but you may only climb in certain areas related to the path you are forced to take in the game. No clambering up on random boxes, roofs or pipes even if they look identical to the ones you are allowed to climb on. The world is very static, with a limited amount of interaction. Most doors cannot be opened. There is one story and you have to follow it or quit the game. I knew the game wouldn't be as open as Skyrim but was expecting at least the level of freedom that was available in a game like Dishonored, or maybe even Assassin's Creed. The game is gorgeous to look at, but it feels pointless. Not what I expect a game to be like in this decade.\n\nThe game is called Thief, you play a thief... but stealing loot is merely incidental, whereas listening to conversations and looking through knotholes for clues that lead you through the story is far more important. At most the player is just a kleptomaniac. The game should be called “Voyeur”. The only sense of real accomplishment to be found is in not being seen – being a “Ghost”. There is no enjoyment in collecting riches because there is very little to purchase with your coin. As for loot, it's repetitive and placed is utterly illogical places. The city is in squalor, yet you can find a sterling brush just sitting on a crate next to a vagrant or a golden cup on a secluded rooftop. There are special items to be found but in the end it's all about how sneaky you are, not how much you were able to steal.\n\nFinally, a word on violence. I like both non-violent and violent games, though I prefer the latter. This game provides many opportunities for violence and the overall violent atmosphere of the game actually provokes the player to act on it, yet he player is penalized for using violence, and ultimately for even being seen. It's like putting candy on the table and telling a kid not to eat it.\n\nSummary: This game had enormous potential but ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it away. You pay $50 to be teased and ultimately let down. Use your $50 to go on a date.","February 2, 2015","false","17.6"," 140 of 190 people (74%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","74","140","190","11","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/meowthepro/recommended/239160/","meowthepro","meow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/meowthepro/","170 products in account","Dear fellow thieves,\n\nI don't know where to start. Where... to start the rant.\n\nI seriously loved the first three Thief-titles. I own them all (already before Steam was invented) and still got every huge Eurobox standing next to me. I had much fun with them and I played Thief-the dark project like 30 times. (After writing this review I started again to play the trilogy...*cough*)\n\nNow a new Thief was released. And what shall I say?\nIt looks pretty? It takes the stealth-genre to a new level? It will become one of the best games of all times?\nNOPE! It is... a betrayal to all fans and Looking Glass Studios is surely rotating in it's grave...\n\nGameplay:\nThis game is way to easy. The guards that shall defeat you are dumb as nuts. Oh, don't forget they might see you from time to time through a solid wall and kill you without seeing them.\n\nThis game is so small... Smaller than a birdcage. The levels of the three earlier titles were huge. Amazingly huge and you were able to go (almost) everywhere. And now I try to go somewhere else than developers want me to in their linear-levels? Nope! I even can't jump where I want!\n\nFighting has become "Smash X as hard as you can, motherxxxxer". That's it. nothing more. Oh wait, you have a bow. And you get special reward for headshots (Chapter 1). SERIOUSLY? If you are a thief, shouldn't you try to avoid drawing attention?\nAnd steal as much as you can? And I mean STEAL something, not just ink.....\n\nAnother huge dissappopintment are the enemy units. There are guards, several types of guards (some have a torch, some a sword and some a bow, few a good armor). And some creepy guys (which they are is not clearly explained in my eyes). Those creatures ruin the atmosphere of some levels. And that's pretty it.\nAlso the talk of the guards are constantly repeating. Funny for the first moment, it goes boring after hearing it fir the tenth time.\n\nAnd well... just look, we have a minimap (a point I consequently find irritating already in "Thief - deadly shadows"). This game takes place in which era? Seriously, they have just invented electrical light and Garret already uses radar...? (as Always, Garret is/was ahead of his time....)\n\nTechnical:\nWhat made the Thief-series so famous were their footsteps. Yes, their footsteps. You were able to hear where an enemy was, which ground he walks AND he was also able to hear YOU! In this game... footsteps?\nOh and well you can't even hear if someone is a mile away or stands right behind you. So the sound is a complete mess.\n\nAnother point I might add: music. The background music. Too electronic and soulless in my eyes. Doesn't fit in many situations, but that is just my opinion. WUB WUB WUB! Need I say more?\n\nAlso I was confronted by several bugs and glitches. Not even fixed yet (four months after release). A disgrace. Game seems not to have been finished. Seriously?\n\nGraphics... the game looks good. Still don't know why the game needs to load every 10 meters.\n\nStory:\nWait.... there is no actual story. This is... I don't even know what I should say without cursing and swearing.\nIt's not even a spoiler, when I say: Energy crisis=> Magical stone explodes => your girl gets affected by explosion => look for her => find her => she dies? (The ending is just... CUT! Open end, wait for the next title!) => FIN.\n\nConclusion:\nThis is no stealth-game or even a THIEF-game. This is a disgrace to fans of the series.\n\nShame on you, Eidos. shame on you.","October 8, 2015","false","17.1"," 151 of 207 people (73%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","73","151","207","14","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chukapi/recommended/239160/","chukapi","Chukapi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chukapi/","87 products in account","I've never felt so conflicted about a game in my whole life. On the one hand, there are so many elements I really like about Thief, but then there is a lot that I really dislike. I am a newcomer to the Thief series and intend to play the originals (just started the original) so I cannot really give comparisons, and I know that many die hard fans of the originals disregard this reboot. But I will offer my honest opinion as a gamer.\n\nThings I like:\n\n•  Gameplay.\nEngaging, fast-paced, satisfying, responsive, fairly varied.\n\nThis is the number one element that makes or breaks it in a game for me. Thief, I feel, nailed it pretty well.\n\nI found the controls to be very responsive, so playing with Garrett literally feels like you are a thief sneaking around. I enjoyed the way Garrett interacts with the environment, whether it be to provide cover, create distractions, access secret areas, douse lights, reach new parts of the town, eliminate noise, etc. etc. Very fun and kept me engaged. Plus, I'm a sucker for open world and looting.\n\nI personally felt very anxious anytime there were a number of guards in the area, and did my best to stay hidden which was really enjoyable for me. I thoroughly enjoyed pick pocketing, luring them away, performing takedowns (both on the ground and aerial). Very satisfying.\n\nI quite like the variety of items, even if I didn't use some of them much/at all. I felt like it offered a good choice of actions, allowing me to proceed however I chose. I also appreciated the stock limits in shops; later in the game, I found myself running out of stuff a lot and trying to conserve stuff for when I really needed it, which offered a bit of a challenge.\n\nI found that it sometimes got a little repetitive, but there was enough of a variation of areas and required play styles between chapters to keep me engaged.\n\n• Visuals\n\nI kind of go back and forth about how I feel about Thief's environments. They are quite samey for the most part, but there were times when I'd look out of a window or across from a roof and see all these really awesome environments and think "Wow, this is pretty cool." The visuals are, I must say, very immersive.\n\nThe graphics are great, but I had a LOT of frame rate issues.\n\nI customised my lighting a bit to get it nice and dark (and always played with dimmed lights) to really immerse myself, which worked well for me. There was a particular part (chapter 6 I think) where you escape from X location, and the escape sequence is really great visually. Fire everywhere, crumbling buildings, floor, wood, etc.\n\nMost importantly, I'm a sucker for Garrett. His character model is really cool and, again, immersive. Anytime I'm sneaking around, picking a lock, opening a safe, searching for trick switches and you get a look at his chipped, dirty fingernails and leather gloves, I really feel like I'm a thief looting in a dirty, degrading city. Plus, those aerial takedowns when you catch a glimpse of him fully masked in his black leather suit are awesome. "That's me, being a badass!"\n\n• Difficulty\nI have often heard people say that the game is too easy. Perhaps, but I played on Thief difficulty (medium) and I still found it to be a challenge. I became immersed in Garrett's character and like him opted to never kill (unless it was those certain enemies...people who've played far enough will know what I mean :P). Hence, I played purely stealthily, which offered a nice challenge for me personally. I found myself often reloading quick saves to make sure I was satisfied with my play through and that I had found all loot. If you blaze through the game aggressively, then yes it is easy. Play the game how it urges you to - stealthily - and it's a good challenge.\n\nThings I dislike:\n\n•  Story\nThere is SO much freaking missed potential here. I cannot give the story any praise because it's just so choppy and awkwardly told. It expects the player to assume things and fill in the gaps - gaps which were obvious, but should be told by the characters to give character development to Garrett and other characters.\n\nAs I said, there was potential for something really interesting, but as soon as it starts picking up speed, it comes to an abrupt halt. I cared nothing for any of the characters, not even Erin. Only Garrett, and that's because, as I said earlier, I felt like I was really him.\n\nI can't say more of course, just in case there are people who want to play and experience the story for themselves, but don't expect anything fantastic there. It's a let down to say the least.\n\n• Repetition\nAs I've said earlier, the visuals and gameplay are sometimes very samey. I don't really have more to say there, but it can make the game a little tiresome at times. Fortunately, I had the patience and the gameplay gave me enough enjoyment to keep playing.\n\n• Immersion-breaking bugs, glitches, cheapness. Aggravating AI.\n\nThe number one bug I kept experiencing was repeated dialogue from NPCs nearby. If I have to hear about how this guy rolled with Polly Addler one more time, I'm seriously going to put an arrow in his skull. It really got on my nerves, especially because the subtitles kept playing on the screen over and over, or the dialogue came up at the wrong time when Garrett was talking and I'd want to hear him rather than some repeat conversation about how some guy is worried he's getting the Gloom.\n\nI had a few instances of enemies lagging and appearing next to me, being hit by projectiles through walls, being seen through walls, glitches in the AI, character model getting stuck and having to reload the game, falling off/through platforms when I shouldn't have, NEVER being able to get on damn ropes until I was at the precise angle, and other little annoyances.\n\nSometimes I'd close a door by accident when trying to peek, alerting a nearby guard to my presence. Very minor, but very annoying.\n\n• Side quests\nBecause the world is pretty open, there was a lot of potential here for some varied side quests. Unfortunately, this did not happen. They are VERY samey - go to X, get this loot, done. All of them, with a slightly different description of why you're doing it. The only side quests I got vaguely interested in was the client quests, where there are actually characters talking to you about what to do, why they want you to do it etc. But there were only 6, and that was just between 2 people. Huge let down. As a completionist, I finished all side quests, but was very let down.\n\n• Chapter 5\nI can't say much for those who want to play this game, but let's just say the tone of the game takes a very dramatic turn and it's really jarring. It was technically a really great chapter, but I suddenly felt like I was playing a different game. I also felt that there was a massive difficulty spike here (in the later part of the chapter) and I was just simply not prepared ammo-wise.\n\nOverall comments:\nI really do recommend this game, purely because the gameplay is really fun, and to me that is the purpose of a game. I can overlook poor storytelling, issues with graphics, and some minor glitches if I ultimately have a great experience and feel immersed in the world, which I truly did.","October 27, 2014","true","44.2"," 161 of 225 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","161","225","2","5"

After a long period of waiting and hopes we finnaly got a new Thief game but will you want to play this or stick to the classics ? In Thief you play as Garret. Garret is the master Thief. One day when you and youre friend Erin are hired to steal a stone from a secret cult everything goes wrong. Erin dissapears and Garret falls asleep for 2 years. When you wake up you find that the entire city has gone to hell and its up to you to figure out what happend when you went into the coma. So how is the new Thief ? This game is Bad and it pains me to say that. Thief has done so much to the stealth genre but this time i can only say bad things about this title. Lets begin with the gameplay. The gameplay is a way more clunky version of the stealth you see in Dishonored and you have the ability to quickly go to a place without getting spotted just like Blink. The Visuals are bland and depressing to look at. The Story is probably one of the worst i have ever seen period. The story is all over the place and never focuses on one thing and it throws in too much so its all over the place. The charecters are all boring and dull and you dont care who dies or who lives. The game also has horrific level desing and its probably the most confusing layout i have ever seen. Overall theres not much good to say about Thief. Its Boring Dull and repetative. Only get this on a sale if youre kinda interested. Otherwise just stay away.

That said, I'm not beholden to the original series so much that I'm closed to new interpretations, as long as they're done well. Sadly, in this particular case, the mark has been missed by an incredible amount. The game is beautiful, and the aesthetic is very well-realized. Beyond that, it's a travesty. The story is a mess: either they cut out a sizable portion of it or they changed the story at the last minute and struggled to make the existing pieces fit the new narrative. Either way, it's a hodgepodge of half-baked ideas and huge leaps of narrative logic. The sound design is all over the place, with characters being far too quiet in cutscenes, over-repeated incidental dialogue from NPCs, and sound positioning seems to be wrong most of the time.\n\nI wanted to love the game, as while there are quite a number of stealth action games, very few really focus on the experience of being a master thief: sneaking around and stealing things. Most focus on assassination or some other kind of objectives. While it doesn't meet the criteria of playing a thief, I still would highly recommend you play Dishonoured instead of this if you're looking for a great Thief-like, even if it primarily concerns itself with being a sneaky killer more than a sneaky stealer.","November 24, 2014","false","12.7"," 163 of 242 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","163","242","0","0"

The main issue though is that Thief seem to have scaled back most of the things that made the first 3 entries in the series special. Levels are split up into smaller sections, thus the more free roaming exploration that made the series popular is gone. The AI seem to have taken a few blows to the head from previous games as well, as guards seem to have gone from being intentionally a bit daft (but often making comments to reinforce this and make it "fit") to being dumb as a rock. It's shocking that a game released 10 years earlier had far better and more believable AI.\n\nGarret, the main character, also seem to have lost most of his charm. He went from a sarcastic and intelligent anti-hero with a dry sense of humor to a generic anti-hero with no sense of humor.  He is quite simply boring. The same holds true for the rest of the game as well, it has lost a lot of its identity. Now guards will just swear a lot because that's what guards do (?), instead of having their inane discussions with each other, and the language used in Thief is just generic "action movie English", rather than having some twists of their own, which helped give the previous games some more identity.\n\nOne thing that the previous Thief games were known for was their excellent audio design. Sound was an important part of the gameplay by design, and in this field there are still not many games that are nearly as good as the first 3 Thief titles. This Thief title is among those games that don't even come close. There seem to be issues with the sound volume for some dialogue (some of it is far too quiet, but not all), and they've made it harder to hear where guards are coming from, simply by making the sound design worse.\n\nThe one good thing I can say about Thief is that it is a really nice looking game. A lot of care seem to have been put into making the environments good looking, and it's backed up with some impressive tech.\n\nBut far worse than the limited level design, brain dead AI and boring main character are the bugs & level geometry problems. In my 2,1h playtime I got stuck no less than 8 times. I got stuck in windows when trying to climb through them, got stuck in door frames, stuck in barrels and just generally stuck in the level geometry. It's like they did not even test the game before they shipped it. Even if the other issues had not been there, I would still not have been able to recommend this game due to the massive issues I had with getting stuck in things. So just do yourself a favour and don't buy this game. If you're looking for some more free-roaming stealth gameplay, then get the previous Thief games, if you're looking for more linear stealth gameplay then get Splinter Cell. Or just get Deus Ex: Human Revolution for a good middle ground.  Just don't get this game.\n","September 23, 2015","false","2.1"," 161 of 242 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","161","242","6","4"

If you enjoyed Dishonored, DO NOT think this is the same game. Yes, they were both first person stealth games, BUT Dishonored lets you choose whether to be chaotic or not. In Thief, the game is centered on being a shadow. You don't want to be seen or confronted in Thief. On normal difficulty, you have to be skilled at the barebones combat system to survive a fight with two guards. The game doesn't WANT you to kill or knock anyone out. The way the game is meant to be played is to stick to the shadows and leave without a trace left that you were there. The game even has a CUSTOM DIFFICULTY that lets you change several settings. Over all, this game is amazing IF you enjoy stealth.\n\n*To the people saying that you CAN play Thief chaotically, I know that, I was trying to get the point across that it is generally not advised and is not the original way the game was meant to be played. Also, many of the comments here comparing Dishonored to Thief are extremely biased towards one game or the other, I love and appreciate both games, and I think they are both amazing in their own ways.","February 25, 2014","true","11.7"," 529 of 842 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","529","842","0","6"

I've been with the series since it started, and I'm not ashamed to admit up front that my review is biased. I have played Thief TDP and Thief TMA to pieces and back and then some. I also enjoyed Thief 3 and while in the end I must admit it was a fairly respectable game in its own regard and I also enjoyed it for what it was. In the origional games you had free reign of the city, go where you please when you please, even if it was something utterly asinine like becoming a member of the rootop climbers guild (some of you may know what I mean, others may not) or seeing if you could jump out of the map or just screwing around looking in every nook and cranny just because you could. This new reboot of Thief, or Thief 4 rather (though I shudder to think of it as part of the series I love) is nothing more to me than a regular run of the mill game that is nothing special or even that good, and a cash grab.\n\nThere is no jumping in Thief so far. Yes, you read that correctly. You are GLUED TO THE GROUND. A real throw back to when I played FFXI and FFXIV online. At one point there are a pair of floor traps early in the game that any reasonable human being with half a brain could jump over, and for our acrobatically gifted Garrett should be no problem to jump. As you can't jump, you have to take a predesignated route around the traps instead of just jumping over them. Do you want to go up a wall? You need to hold spacebar and can only climb in designated spots. Do you want to go up or down a ladder? If so, you need to hold spacebar until you have a mini cutscene happen (and it IS a mini cut scene, as your character takes control of himself to turn around and face the ladder then takes a few steps onto the first rungs when going down, or takes the first few steps  by himself to latch on before you can go up) and you actually get on the ladder. There is no more auto latching on ladders (a crime in itself) and it becomes a nuisance and frustrating to have to hold a button to get onto a ladder, and then become glued to said ladder until you either reach the top or bottom. Did you enjoy rope arrows and their magical ability to catch on ANY wooden surface in the past? Guess what kids, designated spots only!\n\nSpeaking of mini cutscenes, lets talk about mini games that serve no purpose. If I want to open a window, I hit "e". But wait! We need a mini cutscene where you pull out a crowbar and have to tap "e" a few times to open the window. Or move a beam from inside the gap out of the way. Another tap "e" moment to make me waste time. The character is completely automated in his movements in both going through the window and gap sliding, so why are you making me tap "e" at all. Either let me open the damn window in one smooth fluid motion without having to play a tap "e" minigame, or skip the stupid cutscene and just let me interact to open the window and mantle through as I please. Same with being forced to move objects out of the way.\n\nI can't speak for the story yet. When I (sadly) finish the game - and I know I will I will likely update my review. So far though all I can safely say is they've used a few throwback names older fans recognize to try and appeal to them. To be fair as well, they added back in things we asked for like rope arrows. They added in options to turn all of the new flashy hand holding garbage off. They added options to make the game as difficult as some of us are used to. It's not enough. The game is just flat out bad to me because it feels so much more restrictive than previous games. It does have a very Thief 3-esque feel to it, but it just hasn't jived with me at all even several hours into the game.\n\nOn another note, I was more than ticked off at not being able to collect a collectable in a side mission as apparently the game adds a few required tools - in this case a razor and possibly others- to loot specific items -in this case a painting. Unfortunately for me the side quest to do this mission becomes available BEFORE you can even purchase the razor, so if you want to get that collectable then tough luck, you can't go back to that area again later in the game (so far at least) to get it, it seems to be lost to the ages. Not very wise game design there in my opinion. I hope I'm wrong and at some point you can go back because this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off to no end, and I don't normally fluster easily.\n\nBy the way, I was on the fence the entire time about buying this game, especially after seeing it at E3. I decided to try and give it the benefit of the doubt and buy the Master edition of the game. Imagine my complete and utter shock and surprise today to see that there is already DLC for the game, and not only that if you paid the extra money for the game, you don't get all the DLC, just one called "The Opportunist". Really? Seriously, REALLY? The extra mission comes no matter what version you buy, and I couldn't give a damn about digital art or soundtracks or TF2/DOTA items. I paid the extra to have the DLC, and then you put out more that isn't even included.\n\nTLDR: If you only liked the first two games of the series and hated Thief 3 its a definite don't buy. If you enjoyed Thief 3 then you may also enjoy this, though it is far more constrictive than past games (not such much Thief 3 which was also fairly linear in it's own way, but definitely 1 & 2 where you could pull off some fun and amazing things by going where you shouldn't and/or getting out of the map.) on where you can and can't go (notably because every rope arrow and jump is in a predesignated spot). Removing something as small as the ability to jump when and where ever you want really killed this for me, it takes away a freedom you don't know you've lost until its gone.\n\nI really, really wanted to love this game but I just can't. :(","March 1, 2014","false","11.6"," 56 of 74 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","56","74","0","0"

The open-world navigation and exploration that made the original so charming are nearly absent: you cannot jump, unless its scripted, you cannot fall, unless its scripted, you cannot do ANYTHING, unless it's scripted. Avoiding guards with a slight diversion so you can shimmy up those crates? Not gonna happen... unless its scripted, and then they hang a lantern on it, telling you exactly what to do, holding your hand like you are a 10yo playing an old XBox game.\n\nIt's close to playing on rails. Quite frankly, you could watch the videos on youtube, randomly rewind and fast forward, and you'd have about as much control over your character. And so much for the fluid actions of a master thief: see an item? Hold on to your lunch, click E and the screen lunges for it. I actually had to stop playing due to motion sickness.\n\nIt's inconcievable that someone could actually make a stealthie WORSE than the first Assassin's Creed, which was plagued with horrid controls and animations tailored to look good on tv commercials and make unskilled fanboys feel like they were doing something amazing without actually showing a whit of skill, but Square Enix (yes, the Final Fantasy guys) has succeeded. Next time I'm in Japan, I'm burning the place down. Bring a pitchfork and join me!\n\nThe achievment system is also buggy as hell: I played through the entire first chapter on ghost, environmental (put out lights), and did only 1 of the headshot achieve (just to see if insta kills count asa being detected - they dont). What did I get the achievement for? The one of four headshot kills I got. No achieve for ghosting the entire level, even though i didnt fail; no achieve for putting out all those lights without being detected... I got an achievement for FAILING. If that's not a No Chiuld Left Behind game, I don't know what is.\n\nI'll play, simply in hopes that it gets better; and I'll pray, that the next version SE actually listens to its fanbase and gives us a real open world, free movement environment.

Garret, in those games, was snarky and arrogant, yet realistic in his expectations and aspirations, and surrounded by characters that made sense.\n\nThief 2014, on the other hand, loses all of the above, choosing instead to uplift Garret into something much more, connected to a seemingly dead spirit of a woman and adding all sorts of mumbo-jumbo that has no place in the old games. The story, therefore, feels fragmented, annoying and unnecessary.\n\nBut heck, what if we don't care for the story, but just want some good stealthy gameplay, sneaking around and so on?\n\nSad to say, but that's not here either. In order for a game to have a workable stealth -system, it needs to have reliable and credible enemies to sneak around and avoid. It was within my first 30 minutes with Thief 2014 that I saw a guard get stuck on a slight incline, his feet shuffling and jerking endlessly while his torso and head would not move. He was standing in the only passage through the early area, so my options were to either knock him out (which is discouraged by the theme of the game) or reload a save. Similiar AI glitches happened on numerous occasions during my 6 or 7 hours with the game, after which I got sick and quit.\n\nAudio, too, fails to impress in any way. Voice actors are sub-par (oh, and several times faces will not animate while characters speak, for some reason) and the music has, so far, been forgettable.\n\nAs a final note: this game required me to do quite a bit of work before I could play. I suffered from a glitch in which the game would change the texture quality on the fly, between high and low, every 5 seconds or so. This required me to exit the game and start the separate configuration utility and disable automatic texture quality (this setting is not available in-game). Additionally the game has HORRIBLE mouse acceleration issues, with the camera lurching around beyond control, always feeling a bit slow and lazy. This issue required me to do some googling and disable the mouse acceleration in a config -file in the game's installation folder. Again, no in-game setting allowed me to adjust or change this in any way.\n\nAll said, I doubt I'll ever finish Thief 2014, and I don't recommend it to anyone. For a VERY similiar game with much more enjoyable gameplay, try Dishonored instead.\n\n\nPlaytime: 6+ hours (estimated 20% campaign completion)\n\nRatings (1-5)\nVisual: 8\nAudio: 7\nStory: 6\nGameplay: 7\nOverall: 7","September 28, 2014","false","6.7"," 96 of 142 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","96","142","0","2"

It gets old having to do it _every_ single time.\n\nHaving to press an action key to jump at the "right" time without the game giving you feedback _when_ you should feels like it is treating you like a little kid.

If so, stay away from Thief until you’re prepared for its grimy, lifeless, violent world, and un-ironically moody, flat characters.\n\nDo you love stealth games? Thief is a mixed bag where its stealth gameplay is concerned. On one hand, the “pick your path” element is deeply flawed due to the relationship between level design and the game’s oddly restrictive movement system, which results in obvious paths that are very linear. On the other hand, the AI is better than in most stealth games, and if you find that the game lacks challenge, there are extensive built-in difficulty mods which will also earn you higher standing on a global leaderboard (if you’re into that kind of thing).\n\nAre you looking for a great story?

First and formost, this game is a reboot of the series much like tomb raider. While both games were bought out by square enix and developed by the same team, the similarities end there. While tomb raider was a fantastic reboot honoring the legacy of tomb raider, thief decided to do a compete 180.\n\nThe mechanics felt sloppy and seemed that the game couldnt decided what it wanted to be. For instance throughout parts of the game there were the somewhat interesting climbing games from tomb raider which had some potential. However unlike tomb raider they were too short and too rare and really felt like filler. I almost felt like this game was a beta test for the much better tomb raider remake. Furthermore, Instead of relying on the old proven thief mechanics, some genius decided to try and rip off dishonored (rather poorly) and this can be clearly scene with the focus mechanics. While dishonored had relatively good ai and an excellent array of powers including the all too fun blink, thiefs focus abilities were rather linear with the stealth ability being broken. Being that the abilities were so boring or broken, there was little interest to upgrade. Dishonored on the other hand rewarded explorering with new runes ect .\n\nEven safe cracking though a good concept got really old really quick as almost every sub heist mission was in the exact same cookie -cutter home/building and had the same old feel over and over again. Not that I needed the money as there really wasnt anything I needed to buy outside of the those damn shears which you could only buy around chapter 3 but were required in many sub missions to steal special art such as paintings.\n\nLets not even start on the AI. so stupid it's laughable. The worst gitch that I exploited was looking through the key hole right before an AI would open the door and instead of opening it, they kept on walking into the door indefinitely. I am not going to even get into the stupid idiots that tried to chase me while I was on a roof and they kept going in circles around the building even when I went back down,\n\nThough by far the greatest travesty would have to be the story and the fail attempts at hijacking thiefs past legacy. without spoiling too much (what little there is to spoil) the story itself cant decide what it wants to be with various moments of garret lapsing to subconcious wtf moments that just make you want to uninstall this boring game and the ending being a overblown b rated mess at best as the dialogue was so bad. This game had two warring factions being the rioters and police much like the hammerites and pagans from thief 3. In thief 3, siding with a faction long enough they would offer you sanctuary and even fight on your behalf.  sounds cool at right? makes you want to join a side and determine the fate of the city right? WRONG. the game doesnt allow you to make decisions like the past games did and even worse you never see or feel any of the violent conflicts between the factions. While in  in thief 3 you would see back alley fights between factions, this new thief shows you some lame ♥♥♥ in game cutscene with a baddy and all the cops are replaced with rioters as enemies. why the rioters hate garret you are never told. COME ON! this is 2014 and you cant even have live action back alley fight or an explanation on why the rioters want to randomly kill you?\n\nOh and the game also tries to rip off the cradle from thief 3 in a very fail manner that makes me lose even more respect for this game. the monsters known as freaks seem scary at first but soon become laughable as any potential they may of had as something scary soon falls apart.\n\n- final score 4/10 game is such a distorted mess that it wouldnt even be fun to play even at 10 dollars. only good things are the graphics and the bank heist mission.","February 22, 2015","false","45.8"," 66 of 96 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","66","96","3","1"

While it may have some exploration aspects, it makes you damn sure to know that it is definitely by design and not by your own wit. Also there is no clear vision for the game, you are a thief but you like more of gathering information and stealing is a secondary motivation. There are action set pieces that don’t fit at all and actually contradict the rest of the game mechanics. Story has no motivation unless you just happen to be curious. The thing is that curiosity gets thieves killed or in a huge mess at least.

Controls seem limited, movement is herky-jerky. Navigating between maps/areas is a pain in the ♥♥♥. There is no over-arching map system that allows you to see the numerous sections and how to travel between them - you can only find out where to go by entering an area map and locating the exit point while you are tracking an individual quest. That's a major over-sight.\n\nWould have been a much better game if they followed the Assasin's Creed way with flexibility in the types of movements allowed.

Karl War","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neoelnino/","54 products in account","I played the First Thief the Dark Project several times back in 1998-2000 on Pentium II/III one of the most enjoyable immersive game I ever played in my childhood. Thief created and made Stealth possible in video games. I remember playing Thief 1 full sound in my dark bedroom (curtains closed and no lights). The game was absolutely dark and scary, especially when you heard the zombies in the catacombs. Then Thief 2 the metal age came to life in 2000 which was as well as good as the first. Then unfortunately Looking Glass Studios (developer of Thief and DeusX) went defunct on May 24, 2000 due to financial issues. Years later another studio picked up Thief and did Thief 3 which was a step back from the original Thief games but tried to stick as close to them as possible - to me it was not as good but it was not a total let down.\n\nThen came Eidos Montreal, picked up Thief and made Thief 4. Which i am still trying to PUSH myself to play and finish it. Let me rephrase it, I am FORCING myself to like the game and try finishing it which is very sad (especially to me who was one of the firsts to have enjoyed Thief 1 and 2 back in the days - they were my childhood). and yes its a failure compared to its predecessors and the original series and sadly here are the reasons:\n\nPROS:\n+ Good graphics and environment (8/10)\n+The inventory (arrows, rope arrows, flash bombs etc.) everything is back (9/10)\n+ Stealing safes is a very good addition\n+ The picklocking mechanism is enjoyable\n\nCONS:\n- Very poor story, poorly implemented and makes no sense to me (2/10)\n- The LOOT omg what you have done to the LOOT???? Garrett never ever stole forks, and scissors and and pens. What is he now a scavenger low end thief?\n- Very very linear game / maps - and trying to find where you are on those ugly empty maps of the city is a big fail (3/10)\n- As others said the mechanical EYE on Garrett was never explained.\n- The city's life/environment is dead, pretty bad and boring due to its redundancy (you see the same stuff over and over again, same places to steal, same man hanging at the very start of some missions) (3/10)\n- The sounds/audio- one of the worst i ever heard. Ive been playing the last few chapters now audio very high and I hear nothing in the background what i mean is the original thief had this humming or creepy noises in the background and other enviornmental sounds which kept you immersed and scared. I did not get immersed in the game at all (2/10)\n- The guards and the AI - The guards graphically are bad quality and the AI's display on top of their heads kills the immersion. The AI itself is also average, guards detect me, i sprint away and i lose them -waaay too easy where is the alarm?? too easy happened a lot to me in Chapter 6.\n- I tend to dodge the guards but somehow they always are able to hit me with their swords\n- Speaking of swords, why did Square Enix and Eidos Montreal remove the sword from Garrett's inventory? why oh why? At least Thief 3 had a dagger to compensate...\n- The Hammers, The Trickster, Builders, the Pagans and Keepers are non-existant.\n- no more "Taffer" and other old wordings. Also no more creepy quotes on the loading screen, all the magic is gone....","May 2","false","50.2"," 42 of 57 people (74%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","74","42","57","6","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pakkidis/recommended/239160/","Pakkidis","Pakkidis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pakkidis/","1250 products in account","7.5/10\nOverview: Stealth/Adventure\n\nThe Good:\n\n+ Graphics are gorgeous, along with the atmosphere. The developers really nailed the industrial/mechanical setting\n\n+ Lighting effects\n\n+ The game offers a custom difficulty setting, allowing you to set a variety of different modifiers, i.e. no kills/knockouts, no damage taken, slow speed etc. You can adjust any parameters to customize your own difficulty level.\n\n+ Challenge map with different game modes to increase game length\n\n+ The stealth mechanics are solid, it finds the right balance between fun and frustrating. So long as you are completely hidden in darkness guards can't see you unless they are standing right next to you. It can be unrealistic at times but it provides for a much less frustrating experience\n\n+ Although set pieces have no place in a thief game, I found the cinematic moments in the game to be really impressive.\n\n+ Upgrades are handled by stealing loot scattered around the levels and then purchasing upgrades through a vendor. However, you can easily complete the game without upgrades\n\n+ I found the achievements to have a nice variety between easy and challenging.\n\n+ Sound effects\n\nThe Average:\n\nThe story is adequate but very forgettable. The first problem, it's hard to care about any of the characters. Every character including Garret are one dimensional. The second problem, the main story starts off interesting but doesn't really do anything with its ideas afterwards. The third problem, it leaves a major plot point unexplained.\n\nThe levels are linear in design especially the first few levels. Even the later levels which are more open ended still feel linear because the levels are designed in "stealth segments" You complete one area and then you move on to the next stealth area. Even worse is that there are points in each level that once you pass you can no longer return to. There is not a single level that is truly open-ended. Although I enjoyed playing these levels, the design approach is completely different from past entries, and the game isn't necessarily better off for it either.\n\nThe original Garret was MUCH cooler and felt more like a thief than the Garret in this game. The original Garret felt like a thief caught up in a bad situation and based on the writing and story was always looking for an opportunity to steal regardless of the situation. The Garret in this game feels like an average run of the mill hero saving the day.\n\nThe game crashed on me a few times\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- One of my biggest complaints for Thief 3: Deadly Shadows was the loading in-between levels. This game not only fails to address this problem but actually makes it worse. The loading only occurs in the main hub world and when you first enter a new level. The first problem is the main hub world is pretty confusing in its design, its broken up into a several different sections and the entry/exit points are not always obvious. Most loading points are designated with a bright light at a doorway which is a good indication that you will be heading to a different area, however other loading points are not indicated at all, sometimes opening a window sill or squeezing through boxes will trigger a loading screen. It will take a long while before you figure things out.\n\n- With tightly scripted levels come tightly scripted controls. The game controls beautifully with the left trigger allowing you to vault, climb and jump yet you can only do these things at specific points in the level. You can only shoot a rope arrow at  predetermined points, You cannot pick up or drop items etc. Everything in the level is strategically placed for you to be "stealthy'. It doesn't feel like YOU are being stealthy so much as the developers guiding you to the end of the section. In many respects modern game design has taken a step back rather than forward.\n\n\n- If you are a fan of the previous Thief games then this game will be disappointing to you. A lot of the "thief charm" is absent from the game. Eavesdropping on guards, "taffer", Hammerites, pagans, complex level design, crazy unique levels, ...all gone.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is not a bad game so long as you are willing to overlook its design choices and just enjoy the game for what it is...a modern reboot that lost all of the charm of the original. Calling this game Thief seems to have hurt it more than helped. It feels like there should be two reviews for this game, one for those who never played Thief before and the other for fans of the series. Even though I've played the original games countless times I was still able to enjoy this game only because my expectations were much lower than normal.\n","May 31, 2015","true","45.2"," 82 of 126 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","82","126","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/borleskort/recommended/239160/","borleskort","Din","http://steamcommunity.com/id/borleskort/","633 products in account","I really liked the original Thief. I was bad at it, and it was really hard, but it was GOOOOOOOOOD, and the challenge made it satisfying. I'm not one to compare reboots to the original, because I support the sentiment that a reboot should have a unique feel and it strikes me as a bit overly-sentimental when they try to make it as close to the source material as possible, like they're trying too hard to relive the glory days, so my opinions on this game are, overall, how the game stands on its own, but when the game tries to be like the The Dark Project, of course I have to compare it to the standard it's aiming for.\n\nThief does try to recreate the feeling of the original game, while also introducing modern gameplay mechanics, a new story, and more things to steal. However, it fails at almost everything it tries. It can't capture the essence of the original when it tries to, because it has no concept of what made The Dark Project enjoyable. In contrast, it's incapable of forming its own unique identity because most of the new ideas clash with the misdirected nostalgia. The writing is terrible, the voice acting is painfully average and uninspired, every new gameplay mechanic feels more like a tryhard gimmick, and you're tripping over loot to the point of it being an inconvenience and a distraction. Stealing things can be fun when you're required to be sneaky, but amazingly, stealth is rarely a factor since most of the loot is found in completely unoccupied rooms. That being said, when it's done right, it feels great. I really liked the instances of watching guard movment and carefully timing my steps to remain unseen to get that shiny object on the other side of the room, it's just a shame that these moments are so scarce in a game that should be built around this very idea.\n\nOld ideas like listening to guards converse from around the corner are insultingly simplified to the point of no longer serving the intended purpose. Whereas the original Thief had realistic conversations that were usually interesting and occasionally informative, the guards in new Thief sound less like actual peers discussing current events and more like robots conveying conveniently useful information to the player, or at least it pretends to be, but most of their not-so-subtle hints are obvious and redundant. But it's not just the written script that makes NPC's feel hollow: the artificial intelligence is absolutely non-existant and seems to have accidentally been replaced by a dementia simulator, considering the only people in real-life I've ever seen act so absent-minded and apathetic to their surroundings were in a god damned nursing home.\n\nWhy does he keep the most valuable loot instead of selling it if he's a career thief? Because if he sold it, the player wouldn't get to have a collection of shiny things neatly displayed around your dim safehouse for you to stare at. Logical inconsistencies like this are abundant because everything in the game feels like it was designed for the PLAYER instead of the CHARACTER. Windows with scratch marks tell you where to climb, metal grates on the wall exist only for you to use your hook on, and many  paths seem to have been built specifically for a thief that's trying to avoid confrontation in a busy room. You don't feel like you're exploring a city or large buildings because their design is too linear to feel organic and convincing, the maps are so obviously intended to guide the player toward the objective so it's impossible to imagine anyone actually living in these spaces. Developers may try to convince you that it's a design choice, but it's really just an excuse for a lack of effort; claiming otherwise is saying you can't have fun exploring a detailed map, which was half the fun of the original.\n\nWith video game budgets constantly growing, it's flabbergasting to me that a game from 1998 can be more detailed, open, immersive, and be better written than a AAA title from 2014. It's trying to be way too many genres at once, and it doesn't really nail any of them, so you wind up getting a misguided array of half-♥♥♥♥♥ assets from better games. You MIGHT enjoy this game if you're into other modern blockbusters like Dishonored, but I can't honestly recommend it to anyone because it holds your hand so tightly that it comes across as insulting and offensive.","December 11, 2015","false","7.1"," 58 of 85 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","58","85","0","0"

The attention to some of the important details of the Legacy titles of this franchise have been lost on this very shody attempt at fame and glory by taking 16 and 14 year old works of art and completely destroying the well laid out foundations by trying to make it something it wasn't. This is worse than Assassins creed. The developers would have been better off calling this game something else and changing the characters names and just left it as that.\n\nThey've gone as far as making Thief 3 look really good comparatively as far as sticking to tried and true mechanics. The dynamic difficulty settings, where you can change how limiting the difficulty is, is a cop-out by the dev's lack of imagination and abilities to create something true to the series, something unique, something next generation. This game is only next-gen graphically, and by that I mean next gen from Thief 3, not next gen for Consoles or PC.\n\nYou'll largely be disappointed with what is about a 10 hour playthrough. Don't waste the money, wait till it's on a steam holiday sale, if you still feel inclined to experience this huge disappointment.\n\n\nReasons why I -DONT- reccomend the game.\n\nCombat music -  (Music can be disabled, but for some of the decent tracks that there are...)\n\nObjectives - Mission parameters aren't always clear. (I.E You can't knock out civilians, if you do, you fail. but it doesn't tell you this until you do it. )\n\nClunky combat - Previous titles Garrett had a Sword or a Dagger. Killing in close quarters was always the -players choice-, not the games.   You can kill people with a bow, but you can't keep it drawn in close combat if they hit you.   In this game you either have to run or try and clobber the guards to death with your blackjack while trying to clumsily dodge their blades or their projectile weapons. Running is the only  option unless you're cornered somewhere.. which again.. is limited by the fact that you can't actively jump whenever you want to.\n\nVoice Acting / Audio execution - It's not that the voice actors themselves are bad. The sound mechanics take what might have been an intriguing narrative and make it difficult to actually care about it. This is coming from a regular speaker 5.1 speaker system on a high grade sound card, and a high end set of headphones.   Also there is an annoying sound que when a guard is getting notice of you in their peripheral vision.\nThe second part of this is that there's no environmental effects on voices... it literally sounds like the actors are standing right next to you the whole time, even if they're down on the streets below you or a door or two between you.  Which to me makes the game feel very  tacky and unfinished.\n\nMusic - Again leaves more than a lot  to be desired. It tries to make a slow paced Genre feel more fast paced, and it's just not. Listen to some of the previous games soundtracks and then listen to the sound track from this game. The difference is worlds apart, and the soundtrack for Thi4f falls short. Even without comparison to the previous games, it does little to augment the environment of the city streets or the subtleties of sneaking about some mansion or many of the shortcut areas Garrett comes across.\n\nCut-scenes - Yes there have been cutscenes before, but in this it can't make up it's mind if it wants you to get lost in the first person perspective or run it like you're watching some kind of movie in the third.  The cut-scenes look great but... the execution again is fairly disappointing. I found myself wanting it to make up its mind on the perspective, it falls short.\n\nOver all story arc - Written by the same woman who wrote Tomb Raider. Which if you slapped some torn pants and a tank top up on Garrett, it'd almost be hard to tell the difference in the overall plot.\n\nGarrett's look - A mask? He's a ninja now?  Eye liner/ eye shadow?  In general, Garrett feels like he's been womanized. He can't fight, he's wearing eye shadow and a mask, and he complains too much.  The witty reserved anti-hero of yore is gone. Replaced with... Lara-ett.\n\n\nAnd for those of you who are piping in on my play time on steam, PC isn't the only platform Thief is out on.","February 25, 2014","false","3.0"," 320 of 542 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","320","542","0","16"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/239160/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Thief 2014 is a stealth based game developed by Edios Montreal and published by Square Enix. The game was released in 2014 as one of the entry titles on the next gen consoles while also being released on PS3, 360 and of course, Steam. This is the fourth instalment in the Thief series.\n\nYou take control of a thief named Garrett, and play in a first person perspective. Having only previously placed the other games in the series sparsely, I was going into this game with no real feelings about the franchise, other than I had heard great things.  The main aim of the game is to complete objectives in a stealthy manner. Each of the chapters has more than one route that you can take. Each level is also full with guards patrolling the grounds in order to try and catch you out. You are able to distract the guards in many ways, such as throwing bottles to grab their attention, blowing out candles, opening doors etc. On top of a heavy amount of guards, you also have to deal with another kind of enemy, dogs and birds. I have never seen so many birds in cages in a game before; but the idea behind it is, you have to be extra sneaky around the bird cage, or else you will startle the bird and it will start squawking – this bringing attention to yourself. I thought this was a really original idea that adds that extra level of depth to the game play.\n\nWhilst you are sneaking around, you will find plenty of opportunities to steal items, these items are instantly converted to an amount of gold, which you can then buy extra supplies with, such as different arrows, or passive stat increases such as health. Whilst the game is a stealth based game, there may still be moments where you have to use combat; the bow and arrow aspect of the combat system works really well, with an abundance of different types of arrows to choose from, you will always have something for the specific moment. Where the game’s combat lets it down, is the melee; the controls seem really off and it essentially turns into a button mashing competition with anyone you are in a fight with. I know that combat isn’t supposed to be used in this game, but why it is there, and it should be of a decent standard if it is going to be used.  Like I said, the majority of the game play is stealth based, but a good portion of the game also uses the a parkour system; it felt like a poor man’s version of Assassin’s Creed when this was forced on me, there is actually an entire level based on this system which grew really boring very quickly.  Where this game does well though, is the really in depth stealth mechanics, making use of light and sound perfectly.\n\nThief was one of the first big titles to be released in the next gen market, so as expected; the graphics are of a high standard. I couldn’t quite push out a 4k resolution, but I was playing at 1440p and the is awesome. The lighting in the game is done perfectly, and as it is such a key part of the gameplay, it should be! As PC gamers will probably face more commonly now, the gameplay actually looks better than cut scenes.  Water is also a key element of the game, and that too looks really good. Animation of all characters is done superbly as well.\n\nThe game has varying levels of difficulty, the settings are chosen at the start of the game, with no option to change mid-way through your story mode, so you should choose wisely. The difficulty does take a rather high curve towards the latter stages of the game, but nothing that cannot be outweighed by the skills you have learned up to that point. The higher difficulty you pick, you will also be impaired with certain flaws too; such as enemies being more aware, and your energy bars now regenerating in between chapters.  I would have liked the option to change the difficulty on an adhoc basis, as doing it this way may encourage players to just play on the lowest difficulty and not really have any problems completing the game.\n\nWhilst this can is often referred to as an open world, it isn’t as open world as some games such as Skyrim or Fallout. Yes there is a city in which your hide out is located in, and you are able to explore it to your hearts content in between levels, but once you explore it once, there isn’t any real need to go digging again. The base city is small, so even that doesn’t take long to look around. The game does have a couple of side quests which you can do in between chapters to, these are a good way to earn a little extra gold and to squeeze a couple more hours of content out of the story mode. As you can probably guess though, a lot of the side missions are simply fetch quests, since you are their hired thief.\n\nThe single player story mode took me just over ten hours to complete on a medium difficulty, I only did a handful of the side missions, as they did start to become very repetitive after a while, but I did take every opportunity to explore levels up and down trying to find collectables.  I felt the length of the game to be satisfying without ever feeling like I was being cut short of content at any point.  This is one of the few single player only games that I will say has a fair bit of reply ability, you can replay missions to complete challenges in them, such as finding all of the loot, or not being discovered by guards, and you could also simply replay the game on a higher difficulty and trying to finish it with the self-imposed handicaps from the start. So you can probably get roughly 20-25 hours out of Thief if you really get into it.\n\nNo major technical issues were found whilst playing; the game was running at a smooth 60 fps the entire time, with the resolution high and graphics cranked all the way up to full.  The game has full controller support, but I don’t know why you’d want to use it when the controls fit keyboard and mouse perfectly.\n\nMy conclusion is that if you go into this game just expecting a modern day stealth game, you will get a lot of enjoyment out of it. The only reviews I have seen that have put this game down, are ones which have the nostalgic connection to the series, whilst this isn’t a bad thing, it just doesn’t do this game any favours. This is just a modern day version of the game, and in my opinion, is a thrilling experience. The regular price of £19, 99 is OK, if you plan on replaying the game at least once to try out challenges or different difficulties, if you just want to see the story through, then you may just want to wait for it to drop below the £10 mark.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

And no ♥♥♥♥, that's actually what I ended up doing.\nIt's hard to describe why the game isn't very good. It's got a very compitent stealth system and its mechanics work extremely well. It's just a shame you're never using them to do anything interesting.\n\nThe main character's motivation for doing anything is never really given.\n\nThe city is pretty open ended but divided painfully into small areas that all look pretty much the same. It's a nice aesthetic, but not for an entire game.\n\nYour only motivation for exploring is to steal stuff, but your only motivation for stealing stuff is for more money, but you don't need money! The basic mechanical system is more than enough to get through the whole game, you don't really need any of the items.\n\nIt's just a very lifeless experience. Well done, you made a very nice stealth engine.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BavarianGod/recommended/239160/","BavarianGod","[AReV]BavarianGod","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BavarianGod/","3478 products in account","http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HnAPyoOGdI\n\nThief places players in a sprawling steampunk metropolis known as The City, which after a mysterious ritual is interrupted by Garrett and his protege Erin, is ravaged by a plague known as The Gloom. When Garrett comes to, he finds that Erin perished and the city is at it's knees with the citizens united under a man named Orion who is trying to rid the city of The Baron who oversees it and eliminate The Gloom. It's a bit of a remix of the elements that made up the narratives of previous games with corrupt politicians, shadowy occult orders and, of course, plenty of shiny stuff for Garret to get his hands on. The problem is that Garret himself isn't exactly a silver tongued swindler, instead he dryly pontificates on the city's woes and his predisposition to lift anything with a luster. The plot itself unfolds in an uneven manner with the final act unfolding quickly and clumsily; making it similar to watching a racing thoroughbred breaking a leg and tumbling fifty feet from the finish line throwing up clouds of dust and leaving it's jockey a bloody, crumpled mess. There is never a satisfying build to the major plot points in Thief, they are just thrown out without much in the way of foreshadowing dramatic flair. Ultimately, both fans and newcomers will likely not list the plot of Thief among it's strong points.\n\nLike the previous entry, Deadly Shadows, this installment allows players to explore the city between story missions as well as tackle side missions and steal anything of value that isn't bolted down. From the clocktower that Garret calls home, the city is split between districts that unlock as players progress. A jaunt around the city quickly shows players that Garret's kleptomania isn't his only character fault as he is also prone to eves dropping. Loose lipped denizens give players clues to secret loot as well as adding a few narrative flourishes. The City is also host to a number of secrets and keen players will find themselves stumbling across hidden passages, bookshelf switches, wall safes behind paintings, tunnels and traps to boot. Maps can be located that point players in the direction of some cleverly concealed spoils. All of this makes early exploration of The City a real treat but it only takes a mission or two for the luster to fade. Many secret areas don't really seem to lead to any kind of exceptional reward. The game makes a point of letting you know that you have discovered something intentionally tucked away with an audio cue but the rewards are often the same stupid trinkets that populate every other area in the game. Also, over the course of the game navigating the same streets, dodging or bludgeoning the same guards and visiting the same landmarks becomes tiring and tedious. Many players will pick over each and every home before receiving a specific job from Basso, Garrett's contact, necessitating a return trip. More vexing is how lifeless the city feels. Thief makes a point of trying to explain it's empty streets away with the Gloom and a city wide lockdown but nearly every home that Garret finds his way into is unoccupied. Those who are in the streets often stand in one place or follow a very short path. Many of them don't even speak making your time wandering the streets seem like you are taking part in a steampunk parody of Westworld.\n\nMissions are generally a bit more engaging, offering greater challenges and more intriguing environments. Missions are linear, at best offering a few paths to the next objective. Series fans will mourn the more open areas of past titles but there are a few sections which evoke someof the older game's design like one late game mission that has you infiltrating a huge estate and making your way to it's study. It's here that another disappointing flaw rears it's ugly head, while guards can be dangerous, they never feel cunning or autonomous. Guards can be three feet away staring in Garrett's direction but so long as he looms among the shadows, he will remain undetected. Likewise, the simple patrol paths that guards follow makes stalking them and discreetly taking them out really simple. Being discovered in Thief is usually the result of not seeing a pet bird of dog that draws attention to your presence or bumbling on a surface littered with broken glass. If you happen to be detected while in an elevated position, guards will founder around in the area below in a flustered alert state. Levels are designed around this unsatisfactory AI, so there are still some challenges while playing Thief but they are anything but satisfying. Thankfully, Garret's toolbox is better suited for stealing than fighting, so combat should be avoided at all cost. While players can easily pummel a single guard with Garret's Blackjack, facing more than one foe is usually a death sentence. Garret's bow is also a better tool than a weapon with it's long draw time and limited supply of lethal arrows, that is until he get's his grubby hands on exploding blast arrows...\n\nThief does make some major strides forward when it comes to giving players control over their game experience, and the importance of this innovation for the stealth game genre cannot be overstated. The menu features a number of UI and difficulty options that can be toggled to provide players with and unprecedented amount of control over how much or how little information they have concerning their surroundings. An icon that tells players whether or not they are completely concealed in the dark can be toggled, the mini map can be turned on and off, how health is displayed can be altered, objective markers can be turned off and even the glint given off by trinkets can be turned off. Also, the new focus feature can be turned off as well. Focus helps highlight traps, collectables, switches, breakables and obstacles. With a few upgrades it will also allow you to deliver punishing blows with the backjack, hasten you lockpicking, move silently and even slow time. It's a handy tool for newcomers and even those familiar with the series will find it useful for things like disarming traps. Also, easing newcomers in is the swoops ability which lets Garrett move swiftly and silently for a short distance. In addition to upgrading the focus ability, Garrett can buy upgrades for his bow and clothing as well as perk bestowing trinkets from a Walter White-esque merchant.\n\nThief isn't exactly the reboot fans had hoped for but there are some flashes of brilliance among the stupid AI, performance hiccups, lame narrative and repetive trips through the city to your next mission. There is plenty here to suggest that a sequel could provide stealth game fans with what they are looking for. Make your decision to purchase accordingly.\n\n","March 25, 2014","true","34.4"," 57 of 87 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","57","87","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nutcrackr/recommended/239160/","nutcrackr","nutcrackr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nutcrackr/","372 products in account","Thief is a troubled reboot of an excellent stealth franchise. Garrett explores claustrophobic, circuitous city hubs that are linked together with frequent loading screens. Side quests are exercises in tedium as you search for the indirect route into treasure rooms. Once inside you’ll comb through empty drawers and watch Garrett grab every item. Missions take you outside hubs into more focused situations. The Northcrest Manor mission is one of few highlights, with numerous routes of infiltration and flames that encourage the use of water arrows.\n\nWhen creeping around you’ll be disheartened to learn how the ground surface has little impact on stealth. Moss is gone too; so you have to crawl over endless puddles of broken glass that you can’t jump over because Thief only allows contextual mantle. Don’t try to grab anything when on glass because Garrett will crunch the shards and you’ll be heard. Luckily you can hear guards from far away, but they sound like they are inside your ear canal and will never call you taffer. The sound systems are worse than the original and this is compounded when guards repeat quips or copy each other’s lines.\n\nStealing loot and sneaking around guards can still be satisfying. The swoop mechanic has some merit and the focus blue hue is actually useful in the dull, foggy interiors. Unfortunately the story brushes over themes from the previous games as though the Trickster himself wrote it. It ends with an unresolved finale that does no favours to the jumbled story. This was not the way things were supposed to go. 6/10\n","March 12, 2014","false","24.3"," 51 of 77 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","51","77","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198069227094/recommended/239160/","76561198069227094","cyberwiz97","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198069227094/","22 products in account","Thief is an Action/Adventure/Role-Playing/FPS (First Person Sneaker) game, set in a Victorian Gothic world but, with primitive electric lights and machinery typical of the early 20th century, as well as some unique and very imaginative devices.  The characters are a blend of aristocracy, soldiers, commoners and beggers, some with British accents and, some who sound like they came from the streets of  Brooklyn.  The theme casts a hint of paranormal hope in a disease-ridden city of despair.  The player is a thief named Garrett, who lost his female counterpart, Erin, in an accident which resulted in Garrett's near death.  After his recovery, amnesia swallowed most of his memories of the past year.  So begins his search to find out what happened to him and, to learn Erin's fate.\n\nMuch of the city hub is hidden in darkness.  Dark alleys and dimly lit streets dominate Stonemarket. There are paths above ground level that take you past flats, through balconies and over rooftops, providing alternate routes across town.  But, many of the ground-level streets and alleys shown on the game map may look like a clear path with no walls or doors but, they sometimes bring you to a dead-end.  Trying to follow the map is confusing, until you get to know your way around town.\n\nTo get to the upper areas, you climb crates, walls, ladders or ropes but, only as the game permits. The game restricts where you can climb, e.g. you can climb one set of crates but not a nearby identicle set of crates.  Most climbable spots are identified by a faint blueish-white glow, which is a big help, when in a hurry.\n\nThief is comprised of 8 main chapters that will each take from a half hour to as much as 2 hours, depending on how much exploring you do.  Plus, there are 6 optional client jobs with specific items you must retrieve, and are somewhat smaller in scope than the main chapters.  Additionally, there are 25 side jobs that usually involve only one or two rooms and also have a specific item that you're after.\n\nThe promise of a fully stealthy play style prompted me to try Thief.  If you want the frontal assault gameplay of a good, old fashioned First-Person-Shooter game, Thief is not for you.  The main character is not a skilled CQB fighter and will often lose in hand-to-hand combat.\n\nTo play exclusively with a stealthy approach will require a great deal of time and patience.  However, a mixture of stealth, non-lethal takedowns and kills from a distance is common and a more fun way to play.  Remaining undetected will often depend on how you move and where you hide.  Swoop past a caged bird it becomes agitated by your sudden movement and will alert hostiles.  Dogs have keen senses and will see you when you get too close and give away your presence by barking.  Staying in the shadows and moving low and slow is your best practice for a stealthy approach.\n\nThere are a few DLC's that often come with Thief or, are available for a buck or two each.  They are very much worth the small price.  One is an added mission called, "The Bank Hiest".  Not as large as a normal chapter but, introduces a new component to the challenge.  Three others are "Ghost", "Opportunist" and "Predator".  These provide scoring of the three different play styles you can choose from.  You can play them exclusively or in any combination you like.  You decide as you progress.  There is no penalty for using one over another or, all three for that matter.  At the end of a mission, the game statistics will show a rating of your play style.\n\n- Ghost:  Requires great patience.  Your intent is to avoid any interaction with hostiles or the environment.  Stealth is your primary concern.  Remain undetected and don't alarm anyone.\n- Opportunist:  Interacting with or exploiting the environment, you try to remain undetected.  Putting out flames or dousing candles, will help you get past hostiles unseen.\n- Predator: Use any means necessary to acheive your goal, taking out whoever is in your way.\n\nA fourth rating of Hybrid is given if, "You equally blended a range of traits from all three play styles."\n\nThief has three difficulty levels...Rogue, Thief and Master, in successive order of difficulty.  There's also a Custom Settings menu that you can use to limit many of the features of the game, such as types of resourses, upgrades, HUD display features, abilities, tools, etc.  These self-imposed restrictions can make the game especially challenging.\n\nScattered throughout the game are a few puzzles that are moderately challenging.  However, I must confess, one of them was a little more so than I had patience for.  I ended up looking to a walkthrough for the solution and still didn't understand the logic of it.  All the rest, if you're paying attention to the story and reading the documents you fing along your way, will not be so hard.\n\nI should warn you that, if you're trying to Ghost the game, you'll be challenged at almost every turn.  Especially if you're trying to grab all loot and collectables that are available.  Thief employs the usual scripted traps and...well...some cheap tricks as well.  And, many tasks require very precise timing to accompish successfully.  The devs have devised quite a repertoire of situations to foil your progress.  Occasionally, the game sets you up for a fall.  If you try to go slowly and, carefully watch for the hostiles and how they patrol, it will only postpone the inevitable.  In those situations, logic, reason and patience is of little help.  Basically, it's a game of surprises and a few seemingly impossible situations.  As in many games, getting through each chapter is generally a matter of trial and error.  So, until you learn the devs' tricks, frequent use of the Quick-save and Quick-load keys, is a necessity.\n\nThen, we come to the Boss Fights.  As for the first one, you have two choices.  One; you can try to fight the Thief Taker General which will usually end in your demise, until you learn his patterns.  (More trial and error.)  Or, two; you can avoid confrontation entirely.  All you have to do is open the exit door and escape.  Well...of course it's not quite that simple.\n\nThe second Boss Fight is the last challenge of the game.  But, it's not so much a fight as it is a matter of evasion.  Not as difficult as the first one but, still not easy.  Fortunately, those are the only two Boss Fights in the game.\n\nAs for the story...it's kinda weak and convoluted.  I was never drawn into the plot as I have been in some games.  During the early chapters, I felt it had good potential.  Although, as I progressed, the plot began breaking down, changing and taking new directions.  For me,  it was a tremendous let-down.\n\nOf course, what game is complete without bugs.  And Thief has its fair share of them.  Aside from a few technical problems of crashes and hangs that have been reported by a small percentage of players, there are some bugs during the gameplay that can be really annoying.  e.g. there are a few times, when you've figured out a guards patrol pattern, you'll try something that doesn't work and will reload a Quick-save, only to find that the guard now stands still in a spot that prohibits your further progress, and never moves.  When attempting to Ghost a chapter, this can be particularly frustrating, as you'll have little choice but to take action that causes a penalty.  Either that, or start the chapter all over again from the beginning.  Poor quality control.\n\nIn conclusion, I have to say, this was a fair attempt at a stealth type game but, they could have done much better. For me, Thief comes in only a little above average.  It offers variety in gameplay but, while claiming to be an open world, is still rather linear and restrictive.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 7.  It has pretty good graphics, a lot of atmosphere and a great deal of replay value.  I think it just needed more time in developement and testing.","November 13, 2014","true","293.4"," 92 of 150 people (61%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","61","92","150","7","11"

I understand the necessity to streamline for a broader audience in order to finance the development of a AAA reboot. I do not understand however, how you'd plan out the reboot of a series and simply forfeit the key things that made it unique.\n\nA typical Thief experience in the first 3 titles:\n\n- player agency is king\n- Garrett is a master thief, as in the kind of person who pulls off difficult and challenging heists\n- the world is mysterious but largely consistent\n- the various factions' beliefs determine the world's institutions, shape, and nature of places Garret visits\n- Garrett is intelligent, witty, and cynical\n- sound is the primary means of conveying stealth information to Garrett (direction and distance of footsteps, voices, etc.)\n\nIn this new Thief:\n\n- player agency is severely hampered (contextual jumping, pre-determined spots for rope arrow, mostly linear map design)\n- Garrett does not come across as a professional thief, more like an emo-batman, and the missions are way to easy and linear to require any thought or plan at all\n- the world is generic, inconsistent, not plausible, and therefore boring (loot placement, decorations, outdoor design, interior design)\n- there are no factions representing any kind of beliefs, the little struggle there is between factions is not shaping the world, it's just alternating who's running it\n- Garrett's writing and voice acting has declined sharply from previous titles\n- sound is not important at all, there is no robust sound propagation in this game, thus... Garret has a radar map\n\nI could have enjoyed the game with all the other things that water down the experience for the sake of a broader audience: takedown mechanics, focus time, radar map instead of rough sketches, shallow side-quests, shallow character pseudo-progression, whatever rocks your AAA boat...\n\nBut a set of features does not make a good game, especially not one that needs you to feel like you're there, in a dangerous place, pulling off a heist or rescuing a friend.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/azurio/recommended/239160/","azurio","Timkins","http://steamcommunity.com/id/azurio/","263 products in account","I'm going to give two reviews here, one in comparison to the rest of the Thief series and one as a standalone game.\nTL;DR Version (Read the first and last lines of the quote)\n\nComparing it to Dark Project, Metal Age, and Deadly Shadows is somewhat pointless really, as the developers themselves hardly decided to take their predecessors amazing talent and creativity into account and ask "Is this really what Thief is about?"  As a passionate fan of the series, I was incredibly disheartened to see major elements removed that made the games what they were- everything from full freedom of movement to the City itself, along with all of its inhabitants. This reboot, whether it belongs in a parallel dimension or in the future, or wherever the developers intended it to be, is unfortunately a hollow shell. Sure, you're a Thief, in a City, Stealing.  However, that isn't what made Thief the beloved series that it is.  Having the untethered abilility to climb almost anywhere or shoot a rope arrow into any wooden surface- and thus allowing unparallel choice, is what made Thief incredible. The games felt alive- all the way from the poorly scribbled maps to the various written correspondance that you crept upon.  The reboot just feels lifeless. Garrett is dull, the menu-generated maps and letters are a pain to read, and the progression is forced.\n\nIn the end, there is hardly any way to compare this game to the first three.  Of course, the classic ones had plenty of flaws of their own; however this Reboot did not attempt to evolve from its predecessor in any way besides graphically.  In some cases, it's even a step back like in level design, creative direction, and most importantly, freedom of movement.\n\n\nSo lets talk about Thief without comparing it to the other games in the series.  Right away, if you've played Dishonored, you'll feel like this is some strange spinoff.  The environment looks the same. The story sounds similar.  There is even this blind enigmatic woman.\n\nLevel Design:  While the city is fun to explore for the first few jumps and crawls, it gets repetitive quick, especially since you're forced to go through the same locations constantly.  There is hardly any dynamic changes to the guard patrols as the story moves on.  The main level here is the city- it's the hub between missions and locations. You'll spend most of your time here, buying expensive arrows to reach inexpensive treasures or constantly tapping your keyboard to jimmy open a window- a function that becomes infuriating once you realize that its a key "feature" of interactive design.  The actual missions become more challenging and sometimes offer multiple options of progression, often making the difference between "Ghosting" which means not utilizing any resources and basically leaving no trace, or being an "Opportunist" and snuffing candles, using vent shafts, or rope arrows.  While it's nice to have different routes based on playstyle, you usually end up in the same exact location, no matter the playstyle.  The illusion of choice is there, but when your only choice is to go into the same room, does it really matter whether you go through the back door or the window that's right next to that door? Not really.  Lastly, everything in the main hub resets when you complete a mission. All doors need to get unlocked, all vent shafts need to get unscrewed.  It's nothing short of repetitive, especially when you have to see the same action over and over again.\n\n\nAudio annd Music:  The audio is very erratic- sometimes people talking next to you are very muffled and other times you hear guards or other voices talking through multiple walls.  You constantly pass by conversations that are supposed to occur behind closed doors or windows but it sounds like they are right in front of you.  Speaking of conversation, you'll be hearing the same lines of banter over... and over... and over.  Sloop sellers here, sloop sellers there.  I didn't really get an ambient feeling- the music was pretty forgetful and sometimes overpowered the audio, especially in dangerous situations when I was attempting to listen to footsteps. Speaking of footsteps, there was hardly a difference on what surface you stepped on, whether it was noisy glass, metal, or water.  As long as you move slow, you won't be heard. Even though I'm hearing the glass being crushed clearly beneath me, Benny the guard can't, despite being right behind me.\n\nCharacter Design:  As I mentioned, most characters are boring.  Even Garrett.  He isn't some "master thief"- he's a clumsy brigand that relies too much on his tools rather than his wits. I've had to do massive amounts of reloading soley due to him missing a rope that was right in front of him, or falling off a rail for no reason.  The context sensitivity is ridiculous on all accounts.  Regarding his tools, its amusing how in the prologue, Garrett scolds his protege for relying too much on the grappling hook, yet as soon as he takes possession of it, he can't survive without it.  For a city that is supposed to be alive, it looks and feels dead. You either talk to the same three questgivers who say the same things, or to some blackmarket vendors who all look the same. The guards look no different than the criminals who replace them later in the chapters.  Despite the detail and hardwork put into the city, the appearance and dialogue of the NPCs seem more of an afterthought than anything.\n\nStory:  Bland. If you haven't played the previous games, you'll uncover a gleam of possibility in the muddy cracks of this city.  Unfortunately, it ends before you get anywhere.  If you've played the previous games, at the least, you'll be incredibily disappointed at the writers for missing an opportunity to re-establish some beloved factions.  At most, you'll probably feel a bit insulted that they attempted to make some subtle references to the city of the past and left it in the shadows.\n\nOverall, I give Thief 2014 a 2/5.  Almost a 3/5 for being a playable standard game, but personally, I can't help but compare it to its precursors.  The developers decided to make it a part of the series afterall. Play Dishonored or the original series instead.","July 24, 2015","false","30.8"," 43 of 65 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","43","65","2","0"

Graphically, it looks good but that's where it ends. The gameplay is very weak and it's unbelievably boring. I dragged on through this game hoping it will pick up at some point but nope. When you look at the gameplay on a video, it seems to be similar to Dishonored, as in, a stealth sandbox. How wrong I was! NOT EVEN CLOSE. While it tries to evoke such an illusion, this game is extremely linear for a game which focuses on stealth. You are very limited by the number of paths you can take. What's super illogical is that the Master Thief can climb up and jump to difficult places while he can't climb up to the easy ones. See a low rooftop which you should be able to climb up directly? Sorry, the game won't allow you because it has specifically set out a series of spots through which you must go if you are to take the rooftops. Yeah, those spots happen to be conveniently placed for the Thief to use. And, don't even get me started on the story. It could have been much more but it ended up being pretty lame.","May 23","false","22.8"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","3"

Thief is meant to be played stealthily and if you play it differently, you won't have a good time with it (and believe me, I tried).\n\nSo the positives and the negatives... let's start with the bad things shall we?\n\n- Horrible optimization on some systems, while it works great on others (I was one of the unlucky ones and had to play the game with the textures set to very low or else my game would freeze every 10 seconds).\n- This game's "open world" harms it more than it does it good. It's very tedious trying to get to your quest marker, as you will constantly run into walls that aren't there on the map.\n- The story is not engaging, you will probably forget it easily.\n- There is something crazy going on with the game's sound, you will constantly hear people talking even though there is no one around you (maybe Eidos wanted Garrett to have some super hearing power, I really don't know).\n\nthe positives:\n\n+ Really, really, really fun gameplay (as long as you like stealth games and are playing this game as one).\n+ One of the chapters surprised me by being something totally different from the rest of the game, and it gets props for scaring the cr@p out of me.\n+ The game's atmosphere, the world and it's inhabitants are dark and that fits this game like a glove.\n\nThe game has more negatives than positives in my humble opinion, but the negatives aren't really that bad, except the game's optimization, but that issue isn't there for everyone, and it will hopefully get patched soon.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/recommended/239160/","SexyDemonGoat","Baphomet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/","314 products in account","Having played all the previous games, I couldn’t pass on an opportunity to try out the latest in the Thief series. This one in particular seems to have also gathered a rather bad reputation, but that didn’t really deter me from trying it out for myself. I did manage to play it all the way through the end and came to the conclusion that this game is basically a weak upgrade to Thief: Deadly Shadows with a bit of Dishonored thrown in.\n\nGameplay is altered a bit by the new ‘swoop’ mechanic, which allows garret to zip across short distances similar to the blink ability in Dishonored. At first this seems almost like cheating but it is counterbalanced a bit by noisy surfaces and broken glass, which give the sound effect as if you had sprinted over them.\n\nYou get the usual myriad of special arrows including the new choking and blunt arrows used for stunning opponents and remotely triggering devices and switches respectively. The rope arrow makes a return, but it’s pretty gimped and can only be used as a “key” to get to certain highlighted areas. You also get a few purchasable tools usable for unlocking areas and disabling traps. Finally there are a bunch of passive and active focus abilities that can augment Garret’s ability to stealth, pick locks, fight, and other useful thief-related things.\n\nPlaying through the game on highest difficulty, I kind of expected something akin to previous Thief games where I would be required to loot a certain percentage of the level’s treasures. Unfortunately, the new challenge system no longer requires that you meet specific requirements to complete a level. Instead, you receive bonuses for meeting certain criteria like “avoid detection” and “knock out X enemies”. The only overall requirement the game seemed to impose, even at the highest difficulty, was “don’t kill or knock out civilians”. So basically you can just zip through levels and avoid collecting any treasure if you want (not very thief-like!) Most of the upgrades are pretty useless for stealth playthroughs too as well as most of the arrows and tools.\n\nTowards the end of the game I kind of stopped caring about looting places and picking pockets because, to me, the whole game started playing more like an action-fest than what Thief is supposed to be. Even exploring the hub areas for secrets and treasures is soured by the requirement of buying expensive rope arrows, only to find out that the loot you uncover barely covers the initial cost. This is essentially punishing the player for exploring levels, and a huge no-no for making a Thief game. The collectables system doesn’t even pay out until you’ve completed a set, further forcing the player into unnecessary debt from spending arrows to reach secret areas. The whiney female sidekick dream sequence levels didn’t do much to improve my mood either and probably could have been handled way better. Additionally, they decided that adding boss battles to Thief would be a good idea (it isn't).\n\nUltimately, I cannot recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of previous Thief games. If you’re completely new to the series, you probably won’t care and it’ll be another barely-memorable action game to you. Thief’s only saving grace is that it wasn’t AS bad of a game to its series as Absolution was to Hitman, but man, it’s not very far behind either.","January 21","false","33.3"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","22","30","0","0"

A complete THIEF outfit & blackjack, a real nut job over this game. I too was drooling when Theif 4 was on the horizon, but put it off till after I began reading the reviews...  Still, I bought it far later when it was on super-duper sale ($8 bucks).   So lets get to the facts that whatever you heard about this game is true:\n1. THIEF 4  is an artificial soybean byproduct colored & shaped to look like the original Franchise game.  (ie: lacking)\n2. They did get alot of things right~such as great graphics and interesting storyline + grappling hook for climbing.\n3. However, they simply got far too many things wrong ~ annoyingly wrong - to the point gamers wonder if the developers even bothered testing a play-through before release.  In reality, they could have fixed some outrageously annoying bugs after-the-fact with a simple update: but did not.  So why is it there is so much UTTER HATE for this beautiful game that had such a loyal following  ?   well...\n\n3.a: Even if you never played THIEF before, you will wonder why they designed EVERY window entry as "Carpel Tunnel Syndrome" with animation ??? this was one of their top idiotic moves.  Imagine having a severe repetition compulsive disorder every time you had to open a door EVERY DOOR (but a window instead) = now you understand.  (tap key 10 times EVERY time= omg, omg omg.. stop omg why did they design it this way?... omg !)\n3.b: THIEF 4 has the most Frustrating map design system you will ever experience (seriously) its so aggravating to try to find your way around that you just give up.. thats right... just say "screw this!" and give up, because the place you need to get to is only a few feet away, the map flag shows it as such, but you CANNOT find a way to get to it... its flabergasting that ANYONE let alone a game developer would design such a wonky broken map.\n3.c:  Do you get lost often playing THIEF 4 ?  you're not alone, it's because the mini-maps links to mini-mini-maps- even loading for a single (yes ONE TINY ROOM = mini-mini-mini map)  its so annoying that it saps the fun out of the game, your life and your own existance (its that aggravating).\n3.d: Forced play cut-scenes: ?  Developers, you DO NOT force people to PLAY through cutscenes where you can die and have to do so 10 - 20 times forced to watch the same damn animation over and over and over again until they either get it right (or) trash their console with a nearby broken chair leg!  The lead developer of THEIF 4 should go hide in a cave in the deepest reaches of Nepal ~ his name forever shunned.\n4. Garrett already had a back story ~ as the unsung hero that faded into the shadows, sacraficing far more than he had ever swiped:   Now, Garrett is but a ... well, just a lowly lame Thief: steal this - steal that - go back to the same place and steal same stuff again - or only find empty LOCKED safes ?  and who keeps relocking the grates ?  and why are there grungy weapon merchants in God forsaken holes in the ground or ruins that makes No sense whatsoever.  Reliving the Asylum and the undercity was a tad unoriginal ~ we really expected more creativity.\n5. Okay, so done with the rant, the point was there were alot of silly flaws with this game that could have been so easily fixed with an update (but were not for some reason) that would have made the experience alot more fun.  NOTE: forced animation and compulsive disorder on every window entry is a FAIL!  plus; the map design is an inexcusable FAIL FAIL FAIL!   Now considering this is a 20 (yes twenty) gig download and as drooling fans waited 10 years for Thief 4 we expected some meat & potatos, not the knob of a water arrow in the ♥♥♥♥.\n\n6. (buy it on sale) It was worth the $8, but would not pay retail: and it took 48hrs to download via DSL; replayability ?  maybe for some in Hard Mode, but I won't bother because I NOW HAVE CARPEL TUNNEL SYNDROME (thanks Eidos)  and would rather not have to take medication due to mental distress from navigating the map over again.\n\nOVERVIEW: This was a surprising fail for an Original Series that had such great promise and Loyal Gamer following; I truly hope the Taffers at Eidos Montreal didn't kill off the THIEF franchise with one to many club taps to the skull and  Garrett sulks away forever into the shadows; and hope a New Developer worth their sack of gold will continue his legacy.\n...It's a Keeper !","May 7, 2015","false","55.0"," 28 of 41 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","28","41","0","0"

Even today I still hold them close to my heart. From the distant call of the Horn of Quintus,  to the ambient terror of the Shalebridge Cradle and everything in between, there was never a dull moment.

So upon hearing the announcement in 2009 of 'Thi4f,' naturally I was extremely excited. So I waited...\nand waited...\nand waited.\n\nThen came the announcement that broke the hearts of many a diehard Thief fan. Stephen Russell (the voice of the original Garrett) would not be returning. It was like being 5 years old and having your favourite teddy bear torn apart in front of you. Yet I still held somewhat high hopes for the game.\n\nThis hope was short lived.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seraphyx-/recommended/239160/","seraphyx-","Seraphyx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seraphyx-/","210 products in account","Just a quick first impressions of the game so far. I'm one of the people who thought this just looks like a reskinned version of Dishonored (and I don't know if they've changed anything visually since then because it no longer does look like that to me) but so far I'm happy to say it is its own game overall.\n\n(review is a bit lengthy... sorry, I tried to clean it up a bit and categorize things.\ntl;dr: if you want a purely stealth game with minimal combat and story elements, you may like this. If you're looking for anymore than that skip this game or wait for a price drop)\n\nVisuals/animation\nVisually, it's pretty fantastic and I don't have all the settings maxed out. Models and animations are very well done as well from what I can tell (random NPC animations aren't the best but whatever, they're not that important). I just wish I could play it in third person due to the character movement being really annoying (there's a lot of bobbing, too much for me). Almost all textures on max settings look great. You might run into some blurry or muddy ones but they are quite rare.\n\nThe one thing that is a bit annoying to me is the character movement. Whenever you walk forward the camera zooms in a bit, when you stop, the camera zooms back out. Same with all directions, it gets annoying. It has WAY too much of a "bobbing" effect and I absolutely hate this about the movement system and the reason I wish I could just play in third person.\n\nI've now gotten to a point in the game where it goes into third person for some wall climbing/scaling sections. Animations look great, camera however... it kind of swings wildly. It's very hard to control and doesn't let you view much yourself, you're better off just letting it automatically show you the way to go.\n\nStory/gameplay\nIt seems to have some supernatural elements to it like Dishonored did and the story also seems to be pretty similar to Dishonored's so far. The "gloom" is a sickness and people are quarantined, just like the plague in Dishonored, everyone tries to avoid these people and they're treated quite harshly. The most obvious similarity to Dishonored is probably the "focus" vision that highlights all interactables, traps, loot, etc... This has FAR more atmosphere than Dishonored in my opinion though but unlike Dishonored I haven't run into any memorable characters (yet). They all seem pretty bland and unimportant.\n\nIt has also been a bit hard to tell where you can jump and where you'll just fall to your death. Sometimes the game prevents you from walking off of ledges and sometimes the game doesn't. When it doesn't prevent you from walking off you can die or get seriously injured (kind of a minor nitpicky thing but I thought I should mention it. Also, not being able to jump AT ALL outside of predetermined locations feels a bit awkward). I wish this was more consistent.\n\nCheckpoints/autosaves seem pretty scarce so make sure you quicksave (F5 by default) often, you can go through an entire mission, instantly die to a trap and start all the way from the beginning again.\n\nThe QTE events are a bit annoying to be honest... I don't feel like mashing 'E' to open windows every time. I found three of them in a pretty short distance so to have to do that gets tedious and annoying.\n\nThe missions for me seemed very slow going and I'm struggling to continue playing because of that and the fact that I don't know WHY I'm playing. I feel like I'm just going around stealing crap for no good reason. Yeah I'm a Thief but what is my purpose, just survive? Why am I doing this? The game has yet to tell me. I'm assuming/hoping this will change in the future.\n\nStealth, what can I say? It's nothing special. It works. It seems fair. There's nothing "bad" about the stealth mechanics, they seem pretty solid. I kind of wish I could see the line of sight for enemies or have some way of telling who is going to freak out when they see me (civillians sometimes freak out and start yelling, but some don't... there doesn't seem to be a way to tell who's who).\n\nAudio/music\nOne small annoyance is that some of the music is very poorly implemented. Out of no where some weird, loud, techno/dubstep/electronic sounding music started playing and I had no idea what was going on since right before that started there was very soft ambient sounds and music. There was no action and I wasn't spotted or anything. It felt very out of place. I'm considering turning off the music entirely, it was jarring and unnecessary.\n\nAnother very minor annoyance is that the audio seems to travel through walls unobstructed. There's no sense of distance between you and the characters speaking. This makes it kind of hard to pinpoint where people are by sound because they might sound like they're right next to you when in reality they might be outside of the building or several floors above/below you. They really need to work on this.\n\nThe rest of the audio like the voice acting and ambience is very good. Especially the voice acting (lip syncing and facial expressions kind of let down the quality of the voice acting since those aren't too great, especially for random NPCs. It's a bit weird hearing someone moan in pain or complain but their face is not doing anything to express that). Sometimes there isn't even any lip syncing at all just a blank face for random NPCs, this is really disappointing to me.\n\nI've run into several audio bugs now, NPCs constantly repeating lines and getting cut off. And there is little to no variety in the random chatter. You might hear the NPCs say the same exact thing three times in a row, or every single time. It gets annoying since it doesn't add anything to the game at that point.\n\nQuality of the PC port\nThe PC port is great, probably one of the best. It has all of the options you would want and then some (I just wish you could disable the bobbing). Menus are great, you can navigate with your mouse, press escape to go back to the previous menu, pretty much everything you would want in terms of functionality for menus. All keys are rebindable, lots of options for toggling on/off UI elements, so that's great.\n\nThe ability to have custom difficulties is absolutely fantastic for the people who really want to control every little aspect of the game. You can play it as hardcore as you want or as easy as you want.\n\nOverall thoughts\nThe game is very slow paced and not action oriented at all. Do not expect this to be like Dishonored in terms of gameplay. Combat is terrible, however, I think they only added in combat to give you SOME option of survival rather than immediately losing when you get spotted. It's almost a 100% stealth based game which means it can be very very slow paced. If you are looking for action and combat, this is definitely not the game you want.\n\nThe game can also be very linear (and I feel like there might be a lot of back tracking if you want to get all the stuff). The first few missions and areas there are several places you can't go and items you can't get because you don't have the tools. You buy those a bit later, then you have access to certain passages.\n\nThe game kind of pushes you in the direction they want you to go while having the illusion that it's much more open. Not necessarily a bad thing and it's not extreme linearity but it's still a bit disappointing. Definitely not like Assassin's Creed and probably not even like Dishonored in most cases, it's a bit more linear than the latter.\n\nMixed feelings about it but I am only a few hours into the game. If you are heavily into stealth based gameplay and NOT into combat, I think you will enjoy this game. There aren't many other games out there that cater to this genre.","February 25, 2014","true","23.8"," 217 of 385 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","217","385","0","17"

I have not played the original "Thief", this is my first game I traversed in this series and I can not compare it to its predecessors. The game begins with the fact that Garrett got into the apartment what that drunken man and begins to rob him and idiocy happening immediately catches the eye. Garrett steals from the poor man all, start from spoons and purse and ending with the chandelier. In the beginning it was not annoying, and it looks very interesting thanks to good character animation action. After the protagonist leaves the house of the victim and starting with a story about the history of the master thief and his unlucky pupil. In the course of the prologue Garrett says very funny phrase\nOriginally posted by Garret: No matter how much you steal, it is important that you steal.In this case just remember the first 5 minutes of the game where the main character stuffing their pockets with junk, just do want to bridle attention to the fact that the main character steals everything that caught his eye, and because of the passage of the locations on the 100% is a very dull and boring. Then begins the exposition of the plot, which at first seems quite intriguing. But the whole affair fades as the story progresses, because he is stupid, predictable and just boring. Rhianna Pratchett unlike her father is unable to come up with something less interesting and memorable. Sometimes it seems that the storyline made ​​only for the sake of what would at least like something to explain the appearance of Garrett on the affine or locations. In a plot full of logical holes, and some things can not be a cynic Garrett intelligible explanation. But unlike the story of the gameplay and the dark atmosphere of the game very well. There is nothing innovative, and the levels are linear and sometimes lose out in terms of design another game from the same devs - DE: HR, but they still have a variety of passing. In Thief can not play as DE: HR or Dishonored killing all in its path, as Garrett is very weak in open battles with guards. Although all the enemies you can just kill with a bow, because the AI ​​is very stupid. Another positive feature of this game is a great implementation of a bow (with a really very convenient and fun to shoot) and a large supply of various arrows, which can help in any given situation. But the city in the game feels empty and dead. Main characters in the game template and uninteresting. In general, if not pay emphasis on story and the stupidity of what is happening, you can get a decent stealth action with a great bow. But if you plan to find here a great steam-punk history that I disappoint you, there is no such.","July 12, 2014","true","22.5"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","0"

It doesn't seem to have much middle ground. The good parts are good, the bad parts are horrible. You play as Garret, a black-clad amalgamation of edgy cliches trying to steal a thing because this guy used another thing to do a thing. This is not a story-driven game. That would be fine if the gameplay made up for it, but it was frequently frustrating and confusing.\nPacing is all over the place. This game doesn't know whether it's a deliberate, slow approach or a heart-pounding chase, and ends up being a jumpy block of neither. Every action has an pre-rendered animation for it, from opening a door to picking up an item, which breaks the flow of gameplay and pulls you out of the immersion. The hand-holding is painful, with the 'optional' focus mode forcing you to choose between using the blue-tinted cheat vision to do almost everything or you get lost trying to do things on your own. The city (which by the way is simply named The City) feels unfinished, with branching paths that don't actually go anywhere and entire streets that serve no purpose. The levels themselves are pretty small, with dimly lit sections of the City hub separated by- OOH THIS PART.\nIncoming rant brace yourself.\nWHEN YOU REACH THE END OF THE LEVEL SEGMENT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LOADING SCREEN. HOWEVER, TO ACTIVATE THE LOADING SCREEN YOU HAVE TO COMPLETE A QTE. I SWEAR HALF OF THIS GAME IS LOADING SCREENS AND QTES. HALF OF IT.\nAhem.\nSorry about that. The character development is minimal, but some of them are interesting. The level design for the hub world is pretty awful, but the mission levels are layed out in fun, puzzle-like corridors reminiscent of Dishonored or Deus Ex. Gone is the atmosphere of the old Thief games, but the feel of this game can stand on its own. The story is rubbish but doesn't really need to be anything more than an excuse to get some stealth action in. The stealth AI is laughable, but has the nostalgic charm of the original Thief games enough that I'll let it pass. The puzzles are a breath of fresh air, the takedowns and pickpocketing are satisfying, and the items are very fun to use.\nOverall, this game could go either way. While it's not a very well-made game in my opinion, you can get a lot of hours out of it in a scavenger hunt for every last valubale.\nI'd give it a 6/10. It's passable, but DO NOT BUY IT AT FULL PRICE.","April 29","true","12.7"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","18","24","3","0"

So I forced myself through it to see what all the fuss was about and it really blows my mind how Eidos could ever come up with something so atrocious. I'm gonna start off by saying that this game does have its moments, but they are very few and far between, it looks good and runs really well, but for most part though I found it to be just extremely frustrating experience due to it's downright idiotic design. Now I should also mention that I only dabbled in the previous thief games and am not a stealth games fan.\n\nMy main issue with it is the deliberately horrible combat, yes I know its a thief game and you're not supposed to be engaging in combat to begin with, but its inevitable that you'll find yourself in those situations, either because of your own clumsiness or just poor design where there's no way around it because you're all out of tricks to get the guards to move or put the lights out, most of which cannot even be put out anyway. It happens, and when it happens its essentially game over because 1 enemy can take you out in 1-2 hits while you have to endlessly keep bashing their heads with your little club until they fall over and you can perform a takedown, however the problem is most of the time if one enemy engages you theres gonna be more guards rushing to simultaneously fight you, so you cant even knockout a guy on the ground whose head you already bashed a dozen times because the other guards will instantly kill you if you do, so you're forced to just keep dodging their hits and trying to keep hitting them with your woefully underpowered club until a guard with a crossbow hits you from a distance or you miss a dodge and get killed since theres usually 2-3 guards fighting you at once. The instant guards spot you, you either have to run and hope you dont run into more guards or get shot by an arrow while you're running away and actually get into another area, missing out on all the loot in the previous one, or you can do the sensible thing and just reload your game, which completely takes you out of it and breaks the immersion, which was more likely going to happen anyway as soon as that fight started. Also sometimes, seemingly randomly... without rhyme or reason or any alert when you sneak up behind someone and knock them out its an insta-fail and you have to reload your previous save. Some enemies cant even be knocked out at all. Idiotic game design at it's finest.\n\nWhats more? your typical loot is gonna be worth crap while stuff like arrows which you require to put out lights and general upgrades cost a considerable amount of gold, and to make it even worse as a master thief you start the game out without your essential tools that literally cost an arm and a leg in this game's currency. So the loot you do find for half the game you end up spending on those outrageously priced tools that you were supposed to have in the first place in order to disarm traps, open air vents and cut out paintings from their frames, paintings which you discover to be only collectible items that you cant even sell. Regarding the story, theres not much to say other than at one point or another it seemed a little interesting, but ended up being kinda stupid IMO. In conclusion, I really cant recommend this game to anyone who enjoys well thought-out games with solid execution that allow for different approaches to gameplay, this is a mess of a game and you're much better off playing Dishonored, a game that doesn't force you to dread combat and lets you play it your way.","February 26, 2015","false","10.8"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","24","35","4","0"

I made it through thirteen hours before having to bail as I just couldn't take any more.\n\nThere is no fun to be had in this game. Not a single bit. No satisfaction to be gained, no immersion to accumulate, nothing worth experiencing. Joyless. Dead.\n\nIt's interesting because it's a high-profile game. A lot of work has gone into it. I think it's an excellent example of what what's wrong with major title game development. This is product. It's not art, it's not designed to make a statement -- it's designed to be as bland and marketable as possible. It is completely generic. It might as well be called "Action Video Game". There isn't anything you won't have seen before many times -- it feels like took as many bits from other popular games as they could and shoved them into a machine which mushed them together and sucked all the individuality and interest out of them.\n\nLet's cover the good things first, because there aren't many. It looks nice. The Unreal engine is very competently implemented, and the Mac port which I played has many thoughtful little features (like disabling notifications).\n\nThat is it. There is nothing else I say to compliment this game.\n\nThe original Thief: The Dark Project is one of my all time favourite games. So much fun. Sure, it had its flaws but it was bursting with life, with personality. So much thought and care had gone into it. It was completely immersive, kinda hard and a privilege to play. It's safe to say that nothing of the original has survived.\n\nYou reprise the role of Garrett: Master Thief, but you'll tire of him pretty quickly. Before, he was a likable scoundrel, a master of his craft. The sort of guy who'd sneak an apple off from the table by a guard and slink off munching it. New Garrett is insufferably banal - he'd have been much better as a silent protagonist because every time I heard him I mentally disassocaited myself. And the master thief? He's now spends his time rummaging through hovels stealing mugs and scissors from poor people. Oh good, I found a bracelet in a drain. I stole a pair of scissors from squalid flat. This goblet that the beggar sitting opposite can't even be bothered with? I'll have that. It all goes into the enormous invisible bag of loot I'm presumably lugging along with me, full of hand mirrors and picture frames. You don't even get to fence them, they turn into cash instantly. Forget eyes on the prize, Garret's going for candlesticks now.\n\nThey've tried to make him into Batman, but didn't take on board that the main appeal of playing as Batman is that YOU GET TO BE BATMAN. Garrett is not Batman, no matter how gruff he is or how many time he reminds you that he's wearing leather (he will do that a lot).\n\nThe game combines elements from other popular titles such as Dishonoured, Batman, Assassin's Creed, Tomb Raider & Mirror's Edge resulting in something not nearly as good as any of them.\n\nAt every turn this game gives the impression that the makes had an incredibly strict script they want the player to follow. You will do this thing, now you will do this. Now you will go here. Now you will jump. Now you will climb a rope. Now you will think this thing. There's no sense of free will. There's no fun. It's horrible. Bad level design, terrible writing/story, awful acting, banal main character, frustrating gameplay, 0/10 avoid like the plague.","December 27, 2015","false","13.5"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","24","35","2","0"

Thief is a stealth first-person stealing game set in a alternate steam punk age where poverty is strong and plauge is common, in this mess you play as Garret the master thief from the previous games and you run around stealing expensive things. I found myself loosing interest a bit in to the game and I could never realy get back to playing from where I was so I just left it as it was. This is a very slow paced game that realy tests your patiance, now you could either love this or hate it. As you are a thief, combat is not realy a viable option and as such you often find yourself doing odd choices you wouldn`t do when you have a flame arrow and a gaurd walks pass you such as lerk in a closet way to long just waiting for the gaurd to leave as he never does. Sure it can be very satisfying to sneak pass a dozen gaurds unnoticed but after a while I found myself growing tired of the same exact scheme that I had been pulling the 6 or 7 hours that I had been stealing that being acting passive. Anyways, the visuals are pretty great and there is some nice 3D tessellation going on which of course looks great! The games is I guess OK optimized with weird FPS drops here and there ( tested on R9-290 ) could  definatly need some smoothing out. Hard to recommend this game for everyone based on its extreme stealth elements. Still a great game with lots of atmosphere. I'd say go a little loud with the weaponry to spice things up at least if you cant take the slow gameplay.","October 16, 2014","false","13.8"," 47 of 77 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","47","77","0","0"

And this game as far as I played it had only small linear levels with not all that much to render so it should perform better than it did.\n\nI have finished the prologue in the game and the gameplay up to that point was also not all that good. It was hand holding all the way and moving from one visual marker to the next marker (on a restricted linear path) and stealing some meaningless stuff from dressers and the AI also seemed pretty bad as far as I encountered them. At the end of the prologue I also started to notice that the gameplay for the rest of the game will have a lot of QTE's (melee combat for example) and if there is one thing that I don't like in games it is QTE's. The story was ehh... no idea, I already can't remember anymore what it was about. Something about the main character and a thief chick you are running after. If this would have had the gameplay and movement of a game like Dishonored then I no doubt would have liked it a lot more, but this game feels like a bad attempt at being like the game Dishonored.\n\nNot recommended unless you have a high end graphics card (higher than advertised on the store page).

Your freedom in traversal isn't plentiful, you will have more than a single path to get through areas, but these more or less come down to simply what the dev has provided in terms of following a path you have selected to its end, you will have options, but not quite open freedom. Do you like to jump? Forget that with this game, the only ascent in any form is achieved by climbing things, and you are only able to climb onto objects which the devs have allowed you to.\n\nThe difficulty options are nice, in that you get to customise them more to your liking. It has the typical easy, normal, hard, etc, but on top of that, there is a custom setting where you can turn on/off various other things. This includes the infamous perma-death setting (applies to being caught, seeing as this is a stealth game), no upgrades, no kills or knockouts, no manual saves, slower movement, more expensive items from sellers, and a few others. Personally, I'm doing my first playthrough using the highest difficulty, with all these settings turned on except for the perma-death and no manual saves.\n\nA little nuisance, however, is also something that might just bother completionists, as it is impossible to get 100% on the hardest difficulty. This is because certain difficulty settings make it impossible to complete certain objectives in various missions. Just recently I have completed a mission where I did everything perfect from a stealth standpoint, found all loot, never spotted, never harmed an enemy in any way, and so on. But you couldn't count it as 100%, the reason being... one of these objectives was having exactly 1 kill or knockout, which is impossible with my difficulty settings.\n\nIgnoring the previous entries in the series, it is a pretty decent game, I find myself mostly using it to kill time, though being a stealth fanatic, I can get caught into fairly lengthy sessions despite its flaws. It can still be fun, provided you're a fan of stealth, to just get by without being caught while stealing everything, that is available, in sight.\n\nIn terms of performance, it seems well-made for PCs. The only issue in terms of framerate I've encountered being during pre-rendered cut-scenes, where it was noticeably choppy, but otherwise, the game runs smoothly for me with the highest settings. The general appearance of things can also be admired, considering what they were aiming for, seeing as the scenery in this game doesn't necessarily pass for "pretty."\n\nI managed to get this game for $37 before release. I'm not exactly unhappy with that amount, but to those of you looking to purchase, I'd have to say it's more worth your money to buy it in the $20-30 range.","March 6, 2014","true","35.9"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","20","28","0","1"

So I was worried this new game would not live up to the original. I am about half way thru it and I think it does it justice. In many respects they improved things, such as the graphics, which is to be expected. The sneak aspect is tough in this game like it should be., They leave it optional how you want to power your character up, so he can have an easier time or not, They add some stuff like dogs and birds in cages that can react to your presence, which is great,\n\nThe voice actors aren't the same but are OK. A problem with this game that the older game did not have is the characters have limited sound bytes so you hear the same dialog a lot. The old games were good about not doing that. The writing isn't as good, but its not bad. It's just that the original games were top notch. As good as Half Life games. This is solid but not quite as powerful. The original games had a creepy feel to them that was actually very effective. You always felt danger was around every corner.\n\nI just replayed all of them and they still worked on me.

Midlevel cutscenes, concentration (highlighting in neon all things you can climb on), locked on jumping, locked on jumping, locked on rope arrow, mandatory paths, levels that are glorified corridors, mandatory chase scenes, BOSS FIGHTS?!

There's very little of anything actually interesting to do or to see.\n\nGameplay is standard 1st person with stealth elements. Hiding in the shadows, breaking into buildings, stealing loot. Picking locks gets repetitive after the 100th time, like most of the content in game you will be repeating over and over. The fun part is plotting your method to break into a building, most of the missions will give you multiple ways to do so.\n\nGraphics are fine, but performance is poor. Frame-rates dip when entering new areas. Sometimes characters glitch out and start spinning in a circle or textures take on a strange rainbow-like flashing colours. The city is a gloomy, depressing place and the visuals reflect this very well.\n\nAudio is weak. Half of the time, I can't even hear what characters are telling me. The other half, I can hear people through solid walls as if they were stood right next to me. Add to this there isn't any noteworthy music or voice acting.\n\nThe game is relatively bug-free. Aside from the rare graphical glitches and framerate issue I previously mentioned, I did not encounter any game-breaking bugs during my time playing.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a very "meh" game. Not bad at all, but it fails to impress in any area. If you can pick it up for 50% off, I would recommend it. Again, it's hard to think of anything to say about this game because it manages to straddle the "average" line so accurately.","March 27, 2014","true","49.9"," 28 of 43 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","28","43","0","4"

Emerging from that dark world, I reflected on the deceit of Orion, the moral quandries of our nobal thief, the cries of terror and hollow moans of a city squeezed by the plague, and the stench of rats and fecal matter in the streets. I eyed the windows I passed, assessing each based on ease of entry and likelihood of occupants, unconciously feeling for the crowbar at my hip.\n\nTotal play-time: 18 hours.\n\nThief is set in a dark world, bridging stealth gameplay with linear horror elements. The ambience was great, once you get into it. Sad to say the first 10 hours of gameplay was spread out over a number of months, as I just couldn't really get into it very quickly.\n\nGameplay: 5/10\nThe controls are all over the map. And the map is a murky labyrinth at best. I almost quit playing because I couldn't figure out how to drop off a dangling rope. Turns out there is a seperate key for that.\nOnce I became comfortable with it the game became much more enjoyable, but it takes a while.\n\nA/V: 8/10\nAmbiance, thy name is Thief. Excellent enivronments, albeit slightly linear, but that's ok because not every game released these days is obligated to be open-world survival. The architecture and attention to detail was great. The background noises and sounds drifting through the city were haunting. The music got old after a while, so I turned it off and was still immersed by the sounds of the city.\n\nDialogue/Storyline: 5/10\nThe dialogue was sub-par, but the overall storyline was quite interesting. Nothing is really explained in detail as most of the characters don't mince words much, so there are some intuitive leaps in the story. Most of your journey will take place alone in the dark, if you're not prepared for that then go play Nekopara or something. You really get a sense of  stoic pessimism from most of the characters that sits quite naturally in their bleak world.\n\nOverall: 18/30\nI love horror games, and I do enjoy stealth, so this one was uniquely catered to my tastes. That being said I can't recommend it for everyone. If you do give it a shot, give it some time, keep it on the backburner as it moves pretty slow at times.","October 14, 2015","true","18.6"," 29 of 45 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","29","45","3","0"

The first biggest and stupidest mistake is to not keep Stephen Russel's voice as Garret. Not even close to good as the first 3 titles that came out. Has good graphics but I think it still lacks a lot for today's tecnology. This Garrett acts and sounds like a sissy imbecile. Very different from the original Thief series.  Didn't like it!

The game is totally dumbed down.  If you though the voice actor sage was an issue, that's considered minor now. I played the previous Thief Games, I finished them a few times.\n\nWEAK POINTS\n\n-Firstly this game was totally bugged out running 64 bit version, extremely choppy and very slow gameplay, This was solved a few days later buy running the 32 bit version of game.\n-The level design is very linear, very simple, (no longer can you roam freely) No more big size levels, with great detail like the old series games. (it's like the Thief version of Call of Duty)\n-Their are no more hammers, keepers, so much lost.\n-Their is no atmosphere.\n-The Character can not jump (bizzare!), the AI and enemy are not up to the standard as before.\n-The Character sneaks too slow and moves too quickly this destroys the gameplay. You would never want to press the sneak button.\n-The Audio gameplay is basically gone ( walking on tiles, carpet, rock isn't as sensestive as before)\n-The story is just weak.\n-This is probably one of the worst game's I've played. nothing memorable about it.\n\n\n-PROS\n\n-Graphics seems good (but everthing else is a totally failure)\nTotally regret buying this game, even if it you get it on sale, it will just be a waste of your time. I think that's the end of Thief Series.\n\nDon't give your money to Edios for this. Edios have turned in snake oil sales men, selling you inferior products, created by bunch of game developers have NO  IDEA! how to create a Thief Game.\nI still can't fadaom how such a studio can can screw up the Thief Series, one best series every released on the PC turned into the worst increment in living history.\n\nI want my money back! I paided 50 dollars based on repuation of the other three games, what I got what was not a THIEF game or a successor. But a generic, boring, dumbed down, cut scene, half game, hold your hand type of game, that would bore any serious gamer.","March 1, 2014","false","23.6"," 36 of 58 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","36","58","0","2"

Thief games are smart titles, a welcome breath of fresh air in the din of shooters and roguelikes.  Alas.  It's not just that it fails to meet expectations for a Thief-lover, it's that the game itself is littered with so many problems and poor choices that it fails to even be a great game- Thief entry or no.\n\nThis game is, in a word, inconsistant.  There are great things here, but there aren't enough of them to counteract all the terrible, annoying, broken crap.  For every one good thing there's about ten bad ones weighing it down.  If you didn't preorder this game, there's really no reason to pick it up unless you are a diehard stealth gamer, and even then trust me, wait for a sale. As to fellow Thief fans, well, I am sorry this is the game we were all waiting for for so long, because not only is it easily the weakest entry in the series, it wipes away all the canon we came to love, and it ruins a beloved game character that didn't need reinventing.\n\nIn short, this is not a Thief game, nor is it a particularly good game.\n\n--absolutely insulting choices made by the dev team to constrict player freedom at nearly every turn.  This studio clearly has control issues if they don't want the players to jump or mantle on just any surface.  This game felt like someone was telling me what to do and limiting my approaches at every turn.\n\n--Levels are nothing to write home about but they work.\n\n--AI can be a challenge on master.\n\n--the audio is a completely broken mess.\n\n--The music goes to some strange places.  I could've done without the dubstep wobbles, but I like that they aren't going with straight orchestral.  The originals had a disctintly odd dark D&B thing going on that I always liked, so at least there's some throwback.\n\n--The NPC's are some of the worst in any game in history.  Forgettable, cookie cutter, constantly raving and yelling, always saying the same phrases over and over in very close bursts.  Super annoying.\n\n--Garrett.  They got Garrett so, so wrong.  I can not put into words how disappointing this is.\n\n--The story is weak and superficial.  None of the characters feel real, and I don't feel for any of them.  They don't seem like people, they seem like fictions in a made up world to serve the story.  It's the most unfortunate thing about the game IMO.  Even when things start to happen in the city it all feels very contrived and forced, I never once felt immersed in the story to the point that I forgot I was playing a video game- with the exception of some moments in Moira, which stands out as the best mission in the game.  Anyone who says the Thief games aren't about narrative haven't played them.  A single mission from the originals has more depth of content than this entire reboot.\n\n--Start a mission with a cutscene, play the mission, watch a cutscene, mission over.  It's not so far from the original thief model, it's just that the cutscenes are poorly done.  they are trying to be hollywood or something, i dunno.  it's not well done.\n\n--There are boss battles.  Someone please tell Eidos Montreal that there do not need to be boss battles in their games if they write them well and design the levels well.  It didn't work in DX:HR and it certainly doesn't work here.\n\n--The main city hub has got to be one of the most irritating things in any game in recent memory.  They should have cut the hub system from the game entirely and just made good missions.  It didn't work in T3.  In fact T3 suffered from a hub system that is fragmented and difficult to navigate.  That was a BAD thing about T3, why they saw fit not only to emulate it but to expand it and make it worse is beyond all reason and logic.\n\n--Some of the side missions show promise, but they are short.\n\n--The stealth system is servicable, but the loot placement is ridiculous and opening drawers gets old real fast.\n\n--I will play through one more time without custom master.  I may have crippled the game with not using the new items and focus.  (Not playing with focus the first time through did get a little frustrating when you can't jump over pressure plate traps, but have to look around for a single brick switch or something.)\n{mild spoilers follow]\n\nI couldn't help but notice these things:\n--garret's hand gets injured and it's wrapped up for the rest of the game (bioshock infinite)\n--there's a plague infecting a city that is on its last legs (dishonored)\n--there's no jump button and the contextual edges that the gamer can jump on are painted white (tomb raider)\n--there's QTE's to mash a button to open things and to relocate from area to area (tomb raider, other games)\n--there'a  couple parkour-style sequences where you hold down sprint and hit space to vault (mirror's edge)\n--there's a "hold button to observe" hotkey (bioshock infinite, other games) (i despise this trend)\n--there's a third person climbing system (ala splinter cell blacklist/tomb raider) but it only appears a few times","March 4, 2014","false","40.4"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","19","27","0","2"

How could this game be an abomination like this? Don't you have a little respect left for this IP? Did you guys tried to copy Dishonored but make it worse?\n\nEverything wrong with Thief: many scripted moments, smaller linear levels with loading screens, rope arrows only on certain spot, no modding/custom campaigns support, no jumping and only on certain spot (some traps could be easly jumped over, but nah, game says you can't!), uninteresting story and cringeworthy characters, uninteresting faction and lore, a lot of cutscenes, enemy variation and bad AI, horrible audio, designed for consoles and a younger audience.\n\nThe game is so heavily scripted, streamlined and linear, that it feels like I was playing a movie instad of a game. You will not feel in control at all. You can't lean, only if you're on the wall. The controls really feels sluggish because it plays an animation for every action you do. You will button smash or hold "E" for every little thing in the environment, so it can play every time some animation, it's clearly designed for consoles. Every little prop/scripted jump area will stop the flow of movement for a moment and it's a pain in the ♥♥♥ when you're being chased by guards. You can't even jump in this game! Only on designated scripted spots, where the devs allowed you to. There where many little obstacle throughout the game where someone could easily jump over, but naaaah! The game won't let you, you can only jump on designated spots. The same thing with the rope arrows, only on designated marked spots, while in the older games you could use the rope arrow on any wooden surface.The sounds in this game is pure trash, you can't even hear the footsteps of guards and which ground they walk on. In the old games you could hear them and locate them with sound, they could hear you too, for example when you run on a metal floor. The lips of NPCs sync not right when they talk, even in the cutscenes. Audio is so horrible and buggy, when a NPC talks, it sounds like they would be next to you, but they're actully upstairs and they didn't even bother to patch this. The AI is buggy sometimes and exploitable, not really challenging. They sometimes stuck in the wall and starting to spin around wildly. The levels are so small and linear, that the level desing feels like one small railroad compared to the older games.\n\nThe new Garrett is melodramatic and they tried to portrait him for some sort of Batman, you can even see it in the offical comic, how he's posing like the Batman on the roof top, watching the streets. What disgust me the most about the new Garrett is his new appearance. He looks like a emo with all that eyeshadow and his corset, it's way too edgy and let's me wonder what they were thinking when designing the new Garrett. The old Garrett was more badass, while the new one let's me cringe when ever he said something ("It's not how much you steal—it's what you steal" RLY? Most of the loot is cheap trash like forks, scissors, ink wells , etc.), like all the dialogues in this game. And don't let me start on Erin the Super Edge Girl with her anger issues.\n\nThe story feels so rushed and unfinished, even if the game is full with cutscenes. It's like it was written by an edgy highschool goth kid in the recess. Maybe they were aiming for that younger audience? They didn't even put a level editor/mod tools in, so they can sell you map DLC's (The bank heist should be in the main game but they cut it for pre-order bonus and with the current price it isn't worth it.) You would be surprised how creative the classic Thief community is, if they had the tools for mod/mapping for this game too.\n\nThis game is a good example of todays bullcrap that most modern AAA games do: buggy, heavily scripted, streamlined and linear, with really small levels and bad writing. I couldn't finish it, so I watched a mate playing it. Couldn't drag myself to finish it and for my mate  it was a chore to play it. I hope Eidos takes some notes of the reaction of the long time fans of Thief and do it better next time.\n\n4/10 for this game. Get Dishonored or any other Thief game with some fan missions or Styx: Master of Shadows and stay away from that.","February 11","false","3.5"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","19","27","2","0"

A steam-punkish world, semi-open, stealth-based and riddled with rare loot to steal. However, the game falls short on many levels.\n\nThe steam punk is present but only lightly, in the form of electrical (?) lighting, occasional pipes and elevators as well as a piece of equipment you hold. But that's pretty much it. Now, this wouldn't be a big problem if the world didn't feel bland. Since you move about exclusively at night, all the colours will be washed out - everything is a shade of grey and boring. The game "Dishonored" created a compelling, brilliant world in which you played, but the world of Thief leaves a lot to be desired. Cramped quarters of narrow streets and buildings throughout most of the game leaves you wanting.\n\nCoupled with this, the semi-open nature of the game doesn't really reward you. Find a hidden vent up on a roof? Unscrew it, crawl through it and lockpick the mysterious door at the end to find a room full of junk. Where's the treasure? Ahh, a single silver spoon. I'm not kidding, a lot of such areas will make you jump through hoops to collect a single, boring item.\n\nThis brings me to the point of loot. It doesn't feel like you're a master thief, but more like someone who's donned a leather suit and decided to perform petty crimes. You rummage through drawers for forks, spoons and candle-holders. I was expecting missions in the style of "Mission Impossible", where you would get tasked with stealing a priceless item from a heavily guarded and trapped building somewhere. Sorry, those moments will be few and far between.\n\nThe story is nothing special, but it does get a little more interesting towards the end if you're a fan of such things (can't really spoil it).\n\nAll in all, I felt playing through the similar-looking grey corridors and wooden boxes somewhat of a chore throughout the game and only felt compelled to explore further occasionally.\n\nSorry, but this is not the Thief you're looking for.","March 10, 2014","false","13.1"," 26 of 40 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","26","40","0","2"

Plus, I didn't feel like traveling through 5 seperate maps just to upgrade my gear and character.\n\n- Paranormal activities halfway through the story.\n- I don't think I've used that many arrows, except near the end of the game. They are a bit useless.\n- Seperate maps instead of using one big city; frequent loading times = annoying. I have no idea why they chose to do it like this.\n- Routes aren't always obvious. It took me tens of minutes to find an entry point sometimes. Very time consuming.\n- Jumping is context-sensitive but doesn't always work properly.

Unfortunately Thief was a disappointment. While the game has very nice graphics and a strong, sinister atmosphere in a well designed, credible steam punk world, the game-play is troublesome and a drag. I had to force myself to play Thief and it felt more like work than fun. In fact, I can't remember a single moment of joy I felt in this game.\nSatisfaction? Sometimes.\nBut it was no fun.\n\nPros:\n- Beautiful graphics\n- Strong, sinister atmosphere\n- Highly detailed settings of difficulty, allowing you to adjust the difficulty to your personal preference\n\nCons:\n- Path-finding in the open city is terrible. You can't just walk from one quarter to the next. Often you have to break into apartments so you can leave them again on the other side of the house in order to reach another part of the city. Terrible! Moving through the city is like a riddle in a maze.\n- Very few, repetitive pieces of thieves goods\n- Really bad story\n- Horror elements.

The one before were great, immersive, tricky, of course.

I am not one to check online tutorials and after multiple hours of going back and forth at the search of a clue were not giving any success. You get to have some naked action in the second chapter and hell, if I could figure out this chapter's puzzle, I'd probably still have fun but anyway.\n\nThe sneaking system is pretty lacking, I've made a whole lot of playing in the first two chapters and the ennemies seems to "know" where you are even when the noise was on the other side. For example, throw a bottle on one side of a door, hide behind said door. Guard turns up towards me instead of the side of the door where the noise was from. The crows are terribly annoying, just standing there and quacking the very second you "dash" alright, walking can make it easier. But not when there's a dozen guards around that one candle you want to extinguish to proceed.

As most people know I am a big fan of this franchise. Rather than doing a normal review, while playing the game I kept notes of the thoughts that occurred to me, and thought I'd share them for those who've been asking me what I think of the game.\n\n• No taffers, no Hammerites, no Keepers, no Pagans. No mention of the builder, one mention of the trickster in passing. The "rich vs poor" meme is not a good substitute. UPDATE: there is one reference to the Hammerites at the end.\n\n• This is not Garrett. Different voice, different face, different clothes, different personality. Same name.\n\n• Looting is fun\n\n• Sneaking mechanics are pretty solid, they fixed issues from previous games where guards never looked up and where you were always invisible in doorways. However it is annoying sometimes, you'll be sitting still they won't see you, but then they start "seeing" you more, and suddenly shout out "IS THAT SOMETHING MOVING?"\n\n• Graphics are fine. Very good performance.\n\n• No distinction is made between killing and knocking out??  There are no blackjacks, you sneak up behind someone and press an action key to perform a melee takedown.\n\n• Contextual controls are dumb. I'll decide when I want to jump, thanks.\n\n• The paintings are pretty... interesting.\n\n• I missed the old thief-style cutscenes\n\n• Lockpicking minigames are terrible in all games, this one is less terrible than others.\n\n• The city in this game is better than the one in Deadly Shadows, and I like the sidequests.\n\n• Rope arrows are limited to only specific anchor points, they seem to disappear when you reload the zone and the arrows cannot be retrieved.\n\n• Much of the humor and personality of the city is gone. The humor that does exist isn't nearly as funny or clever.\n\n• No more crate stacking, and no jumping\n\n• Hate the name, we already had a Thief. This is Thief 4.\n\n• The city lost a lot of the steampunk vibe.\n\n• I enjoy the rooftop navigation, but wish there were fewer loadscreens.\n\n• Windows are annoying. You have to go through a button mashing process to open one to get into a house, then the window immediately closes and you have to do it again to get back out. It quickly becomes tedious.\n\n• The asylum seems like a less-scary ripoff of The Shalesbridge Cradle.\n\n• If a guard sees something has changed, like a door open on their patrol route, he will investigate. This is great. I also noticed on occasion they will investigate every time they pass that open door. If the room is fairly big this can mean you add a significant delay to their patrol, which is strategically interesting, if not particularly smart AI.\n\n• On the hardest difficulty, when playing passively, Thief is more difficult than Dishonored.\n\n• Some fun puzzles for getting to loot\n\n• Why is Garrett collecting a  bunch of crap in his home now instead of selling it?\n\n• Be very careful about hiding in wardrobes as it forces the game to quicksave.\n\n• It seems like the new developers only played Deadly Shadows\n\n• The story was mostly an incoherent mix of cliches, and ends unsatisfactorily.\n\n• The Thief-Taker General is pretty ridiculous.\n\nThe game is not horrible, but given the source material and what it could have been, it is very disappointing. If you want a true Thief expierience, Thief 2 and 1 (Gold) are still perfectly playable, and still the best games ever made.","May 31, 2014","false","34.2"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","0"

I don't know if they were trying to optimize the game for weaker machines(It didn't work), but I feel like there were much better ways to do it. How small is it? About two streets for an area. There are about 2 areas each chapter, and maybe a few rooms. If you were living in that gloomy city it'll take you 20 minutes to walk from one end of the city to the other. That's when you combine ALL of the areas presented to you, sans the tomb-raider level (I ♥♥♥♥ you not).\n\nEach level has only 1 or 2 possible ways to do it. Don't bother trying to wander off and explore - you will probably have to get back after getting yourself into a stiky situation.\nThis feels increadblt constraining. Isn't the point of stealth is to find the optimal path best fitting your playstyle?\nI recall when I wandered off to loot something in a hallway, and got stuck between two guards. That's right. Neither was moving. I waited a solid TWENTY MINUTES to get an opening to slip away. and even then I alerted one of the guards and he attacked me.\nNot only that, but you also have a restriced set of...things to interact with. A few beams to walk on. Only some walls can be climbed. Only some beams can be shot with a rope arrow.\n\nLOTS of loading screens in the middle of a chapter. They did this clever thing where the animation of opening a window is loading time for the game.\nSo you are trying to complete a level. You find a window and think that room will lead you to there. You wait for the loading of the room to complete. Then you open another window on the other side of the room to load another area. Or maybe it loads the area you've just left. And after getting there, you suddenly realize this is the wrong way. Or you want to pick up a quest. Now you have to go back throught TWO loading screens.\nI don't even know what are they loading - each area is incredably small (as I mentioned) and there aren't a lot of objects to render. They could have just as well loaded the entire thing all at once in extra 30 seconds and saved us the pain.\n\nThe art direction of this game is great. I wish it was a big less dark and a bit brighter, so we could see the world better. When I got closer (really closer) to objects I could see how beatifull they were. Shame everything's covered in shadows and you can't see it.\n\nThe story is the only reason I completed the game. Although it was predictable, I still enjoyed it very much. I WANTED to get to the ending and feel the world around me.\n\nMagic is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Magic is used as a cheap device to deliver plot. No I don't mean plot device. It literally, on a few occasions, delivered plot to us. It was like an exposition. With clouds. Nothing of intrest is ever done with it. I would have liked if they pulled the magic aspect all together out of the story, except the last reveal about Erin(which still can be done differantly but I accept the fact that the screen writer are lazy).\n\nAny character that Isn't Erin or Garath is a cardboard that speaks. And this is coming from someone who read Twilight and didn't want to kill themselves. There are lots of characters that have an interesting design or concept, but don't do anything and don't contrebute to the story at all.\n\nGame time is short. It says I have 17 hours in game. That is a lie. Remember I said I was stuck between two guards for 20 minutes? This is the entire game. You wait for guards to ♥♥♥♥ off so you could climd that wall behind them. Then After going through more guards, you relise that it's the wrong way. Shame on you - the way back isn't as easy. Better wait some more. I'd say I probably only got half of my total time on record with actual gameplay.\n\nSide quests are boring and hard to get. In all my error prone exploring, I've only managed to complete two or three side-quests. THREE. I was TRYING to get some. But they were in the 'only one way to do it' catagory of how to get to the room that has that quest.\n\nA lot of people are complaining about combat system being ♥♥♥♥♥♥. They are right. It's so horrible it's only there to laught at you because you can't use it. But a stealth game doesn't have to have a good combat system. I respect the devs decision to make this game stealth-only. It only becomes an issue when the stealth mechanism is horrible. but the combat is even worse. And then you are left with two ♥♥♥♥♥♥ options, when one would not get you killed but will kill your patience.\nUsusally for games like this I'd recommend buying it on sale. But this game is so bad, that it's not even about the money anymore. If you were to recieve a one million dollar inheritance I'd still tell you to not buy this game. The time wasted on it is not worth it.\n\ntl;dr - Bad gameplay, Bad stealth. Bad characteres. Bad Level design.

I don’t mind changing the backstory and getting rid of the known and established lore, the conflict between the Pagans and Mechanist etc.\nThe thing is – new Thief fails in creating something equally interesting on its own. It just has this generic XIX century steampunk vibe, that didn’t manage to tackle my interest.\n\nI will just try to explain why I’m rather disappointed in this game. There is no single game feature that would make it mediocre in my opinion, it’s just the sum of little things, that create this rather bland experience. I will try to explain it giving just some points as an example.\n\n\nLack of the ability to jump – it’s not that limiting as I initially was led to believe, because you can mantle practically on any surface you would like to, with only few exceptions, so I’m ok with that.\nContextual rope arrow – I can live with that, but implementing that solution causes the rope anchor point to stand like sore thumbs and screaming invitation – “look, here you can climb, this is the way further to something interesting”.\n\nSound design – now this is a big letdown for me. Original Thief games had wonderful sound design that let you place characters and objects in 3D space. Judging by the sound of footsteps you were able to determine the surface someone is walking on, but also whether someone is closing up on you, or getting away further.\nIn new Thief it’s hardly the case. Footsteps really doesn’t give you good sense of direction, and to make things worse – they are often muffled by generics speeches that persons give. About ♥♥♥♥ rings. From the other side of the stone wall. With audio repeated twice. And alas, that happens frequently, especially when you load new area (which also happens frequently). So often what would be a tense moment of hiding from a patrolling guard will be ruined, because you will only hear repeated generic guard chat (to loudly, even from the other side of the wall (sic!)) ad nauseam that will muffle the footsteps.\nAs for the random chats and guard lines – they have a big variety of them, but it seems like every person you encounter has only 2-3 limited lines, that they repeat constantly. So you creep for long minutes around the guards that are having the same conversation over and over. Occasionally you will encounter a scripted exposition conversation that shed some light on the world, characters, or even gives you clues about hidden loot. But Karras forbid you raise their suspicion level, because if you interrupt them, there is no coming back (except for a load long before you encounter such situation).\nStaying with that – voice acting is pretty decent, albeit there are some issues with lip-sync, and Garret on liners are sometimes over the top.\n\nSpeaking about conversations we go to another element – the writing. It’s not that good. I don’t know how the story was butchered and changed in its turbulent development process, but the outcome is average at most and sometimes straight out laughable (so the protagonist is a Thief – lets name his nemesis Thief- Catcher General). Conversations imply sexual things in not very subtle style, like it was written with teenage audience in mind. Plot is uninteresting and cliché-ridden, not to mention that it bears unhealthy resemblance to Dishonored (city dying of plague, you are the only saviour, your allies betray you).\n\nGoing back to gameplay – City hub is divided into many districts, all separated by loading zones, and sometimes having loading zones in them. It’s painfully boring to navigate, especially if you have explored most of it on the beginning, because some side missions are available only after finishing main story “Chapters”. So, one mission requires you to go through 3 separate loading zones before you get to the mission area, and there is nothing to do on the way. You have to sneak (or fight) past the guards with, well known by that point, patrol routes, listening to the same conversations.\nThe City itself seems lifeless.  I didn’t expect crowds on the streets by night (and the plague is a poor device to justify keeping NPC’s of the streets), but even if there is a public event, like hanging  there are 2 persons performing it, and just 2 citizens watching.\n\nMain story is divided into Chapters, but they are designed rather linearly, with multiple loading sections (cleverly disguised, I admit). They just feel like a scripted set of arenas you have to complete in order to move forward, to the next arena. And what’s worse, they feel even more limiting than Dishonored. Admittedly, there are some missions, where you can freely roam big mansions, and they gave me big enjoyment and this “Thief” vibe I was longing to feel. The plot sometimes acts as just to give you a pretext to move your character to a different setting.\n\nThe graphics are nice, and lighting is especially good looking, but not always working well. For example if you hide behind a crate with only your head sticking out and the passing guard will have a lantern, the screen will flash to indicate that you are fully visible (another not good design decision), but you will still remain hidden. Or you will be spotted on the other side of the fence, even if you were hiding there (maybe the can see you through the space between planks?). But those are rare instances. Other than that, the bluish tint in everything, and the repeating window textures for rooms that you cannot get into got me bored after some time. On the other hand, interiors are sometimes exceptionally well designed, and underline the differences between mission locations.\n\nAs for exploring the City – almost every breaking and entering will be proceed by a loading screen, which takes form of your hands working a crowbar animation, paired with a QTE. Also – your hands are almost constantly visible, and you can see the animations for doing almost anything – looking for a hidden switch, working a lock pick, or taking the loot. But since the most common loot is a pair of scissors laying precisely in the middle of a drawer, it quickly gets boring, and rather brakes immersion, because you know that behind every pair of golden scissors there is an 1-2 second long animation, that you can’t do anything about. I don’t know why they just didn’t go for stacks of coin here and there.\n\nThe AI – while they seem competent, when alerted, it’s painfully easy to lose the chase, even by going around the corner and hiding behind a crate, or changing the climbing up or down. Other than that, the change their patrol routs on the basis of your current location. So even if they have no indication of you moving to a different area, they will go and do their routine over there, because the game says so – also a poor design decision.  Other than that they react rather properly to you dousing the lights, or making too much noise.\n\nNow for the good things. Side missions proved to give me most enjoyment so far, and some have really brilliant moments. They are well thought out, loading screens are better incorporated (talking about bank job mission here), the gave me the thief experience I was hoping to get.\n\nBut, alas, those few great moments drown in the sea of mediocrity.\n\nAnd that is why I don’t recommend buying this game for its current price. I’m rather disappointed with the experience, and while I’ve spent around 30h, I had to fight boredom on much more occasions that I wished.\n\nSo, to sum up – while not a bad game, it’s not good either, I would recommend waiting for a 50% sale before buying it.","March 27, 2014","false","32.4"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","18","26","0","2"

If you have played the originals you will likely hate this game too.  The main character feels fake.  He now wears a gay ninja mask over his mouth.  He talks way too much, each time reminding you that this guy is not the real Garrett.  Some how the Devs thought it would be a good thing to give their version of Garrett a Sister named Erin.  What were they thinking? They killed off the fan's favorite fanatical group "The Hammers".   The levels are badly designed and linear.  You can't play your own way; only the way the level is setup.  The player is forced into actions.  Time events and button mashing.  Some how thief has become a platformer/parkour type game, which you would think would open up more areas to the player, but no in fact when you platform its because that is where you are meant to go to progress the level.  No alternate routes at all.  The Thief series made you feel like a thief, but this new game's feel is way off base.  When you blackjack a guard you have to sit through the same wack him over the head cut-scene each time.  Taking a purse off an AI is way over used, everything starts to be repeatative fast. The Dev's had feedback before the release of this game as to what fans wanted and expected. So how did they still get it so wrong? How many thosands of people tried to warn them to use Garrett's original voice actor even having a signed petition. Did these Devs even play the originals? The story is not good, but more than that, how Garrett reacts to the unfolding of the story again reminds you that this is not the real Garrett.  Each mission sould feel in itself meaning full even if it dosn't progress the main story line. In this game you don't feel a sence of acomplishment.  I am not against alot of the new concepts introduced in this game, but they were done so poorly.  Focus can be turned off but it is the whole base for the storyline.  So you have a choice to use focus which make you feel less like a thief or turn it off and have no idea what the storyline is talking about.  This could have been a great game, and I tired so hard to like it.  In the end you just have to give up and call it what it is, TRASH.  I would like to have my money back.  I even bought a new computer just so it could play this game when it came out.  So here are my last words.  If you like Parkour try Mirrior's Edge.  If you would like a thief games try Thief Gold, Thief 2, and Thief 3: Deadly Shadows.","May 3, 2015","false","6.1"," 25 of 39 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","25","39","0","0"

I played those, really loved those and for me Dishonored feels much closer to them than this game. Apart from the occasional reference and the name of some characters, the protagonist among them, this game has not much to do with them. If you can accept that this is not a sequel, if you can somehow separate the two things, than you will find a great game. It's a different Thief, but it still do things quite well. It has a great atmosphere, nicely working stealth mechanics, less combat options (which for me in this genre was an improvement), and quite a lot of stuff to do (haven't seen much of the main plot yet, though I liked it so far, because I was sidetracking a lot). I think this game would have been much better received, if they gave it a different name, because people nowadays have crazy expectations and amazingly whiney attitude, and feeding them hype is the worst thing to do for any game, almost anything is doomed to fail this way (just look at Watch Dogs, which is also a decent game in my opinion). So if you like stealth games with great atmosphere and lots to explore, I can really recommend this one, but if you want to pick up the story of that (ok, it's true, won't deny it) better and cooler Garrett of old and see what happens after Deadly Shadows, then you will be disappointed.","June 16, 2014","true","7.6"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

At least I finished the Xb360 port before this one, so I KNOW how the story goes. I bought the PC port to try and replay and see what exactly made me uphold this game to such disdainful regards.\n\nBig Mis-Mother♥♥♥♥ing-take. 29.99 that I’ll never get back. Wish this game came with a real blackjack so I could beat myself mercilessly.\n\nLong-ish review incoming!\n\nThief is just 3 letters away from ♥♥♥♥. Remember the older Thief games, and how they basically defined the NON-LINEAR stealth genre? The freedom you had in those games? How you could basically approach the situation in many ways? Hell, in Thief 3 I’ve still to find ALL the secret passages/places to explore in a lot of the levels. THAT’S level design right there, making for some really amazing replayability.\n\nAnd then this incestuous clone of a Dishonored “””game””” (I’m not feeling generous) comes along, takes AAAAAAALLL the established Thief canon, wipes its merry ♥♥♥ with it, and shoves it out the window.\n\nLet’s start with the pro’s and cons:\n\nPro’s:\n\n+Fantastic graphics. I really feel immersed in the world.\n+Pretty nice soundtrack! I like the title theme and a lot of the fighting themes.\n+Fluent controls.\n\nCons:\n+Gameplay is boring and feels like a half-♥♥♥♥♥/cancelled Dishonored DLC.\n+Very. Very linear. I’m a thief, what the ♥♥♥♥? Why can I only climb certain ledges?\n+Very. Very. Bland. Level. Designs. Holy. ♥♥♥♥. I swear two levels are exactly the same outline.\n+Something’s wrong with the audio. You can hear guards from like 500 feet away talking as if they’re right next to you?\n+This story feels so unfinished? Garrett’s motives for being there is never really explained?\n+Oh yeah that takes me to:\n+Garrett\n+Garrett\n+The Protagonist\n+Garrett\n+(Not pictured: Me, crying.)\n\nGarrett deserves his own paragraph, excuse me for a moment.\nNow. Let’s go to other protagonists for a quick comparison.\n\nHow come when The Master Chief says he’s a legendary spartan, we believe him?\nBecause we saw him go from soldier to legend in all his games!\nHow come when Samus Aran says she’s a bounty hunter, and really good at it, and we believe her?\nBecause we saw her become one in all her games!\nHow come when SLY COOPER says he’s a MASTER THIEF, we believe him?\nBecause we saw him become one in all his games!\nHow come when Luke Skywalker says he’s a jedi master, we believe him?\nBecause we saw him become one in the original trilogy!!!\nHow come when Garrett in the Thief reboot says he’s a master thief, we believe him?\nErrr….Because...He...Said...So? And...Uhh…..He does a sick jump???\n\nDo you get what I’m coming at?\nIf you didn’t, here’s an explanation:\n\nGarrett is one of the most badly written, bland, cliche characters I’ve ever seen in a video game. It’s like Eidos just opened up a template in Character Maker 2.0 called  ‘dark and edgy hero’ and just left it blank.  You can’t just introduce a character out of nowhere and say they’re the BEST at what they do without ANY EXPLANATION.  That’s so bland, that’s so BORING! He never really changes throughout the story. He ALWAYS speaks in the same tone, NEVER seems to show ANY OTHER EMOTION other than Dark Edgy Batman. His REASON for being in the MAIN STORY is never really CLEARLY given out? He’s just… There?\n\nNow, this is all taking into account that this is a reboot, so I’m going to take HIS OLD GAME PERSONALITY AND CANON, and just kinda...Grind it to dust beneath my foot.\n\nThe voice acting in this game makes Symphony of the Night look like a Shakespeare opera. It’s either too monotone or WAY TOO forced. Just like every single popular youtuber! The story is so lackluster, and fails to explain A LOT of things. Real talk, if you ever ask yourself  “Will this ever be explained?” , NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN, IT WON’T!\n\nIn short: Thief was a promising reboot game, but ultimately falls short because of a lot of Cons that massively outweigh the Pro’s. Boring story, boring protagonist, bland gameplay, but impressive visuals once again bring out the “graphics don’t make a good game” mantra.\n\nFinal score: 4.5/10. Can’t recommend this to anyone, not even on sale. Dishonored is 10 dollars less, and is a much, much better stealth game.","November 25, 2015","false","4.8"," 33 of 54 people (61%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","61","33","54","9","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashyrat/recommended/239160/","ashyrat","ashyrat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashyrat/","503 products in account","A terribly uneven game that does a lot of the things right and at the same time fails to be consistent enough to be fun for the entire duration of the campaign. It is really hard to call it a successor to the Thief series but the devs don't seem to really try to do it as the game is set centuries after the original story and the main hero only shares his name with the previous protagonist (as do some other characters which is a bit weird but I guess they were aiming at the "history repeats itself" angle, too bad its terribly underdeveloped because it would be a clever idea to put into the game).\n\nAt its core Thief is a decent stealth game, harder than Dishonored at times as Garret is a lousy fighter but tedious as hell when it comes to incredibly constricted and linear level design. Towards the end there is practically one route the hero can take which results in numerous trail and error sequences when you try to get the timing just right and avoid being detected.\n\nThe atmosphere also comes and goes, the designers tried to make the city spooky, rotten and ugly but really it looks just bland, empty and boring. I don't know why they decided to make it semi-sandbox when there is virtually nothing to do in it except hoard numerous collectibles that don't add much to the story. Tomb Raider did it right and finding hidden stuff was fun since each item had its own little description and story... here I can only call it tedious as there is absolutely nothing that makes the hundredths golden cup worth the effort. There are however chapters that do the atmosphere well and are a nice little story on the own right (like Moira Asylum) unfortunately when this does happen you can expect some random mechanic or piece of never before encountered lore to pop up and make the game inconsistent within its own setting.\n\nI do have to praise the upgrade system that lets you buy new tools of the trade, unscrewing vents, cutting pictures out of frames, disabling traps and lockpicking was the most fun I had in this game. All those mechanics work extremely well are fun to use and truly make you feel like the titular master thief (you can also disable on-screen aids to make it even more challenging which is a nice touch), the only thing I was truly missing was opening safes by hearing alone considering how skilled Garrett is but I guess you can't have everything. I am also glad different kinds of arrows (like water, rope etc.) made an appearance. Unfortunately yet again the constricted level design forces the player to use then even if he/she does not want to because otherwise completing a chapter would be impossible but only when level design allows for it and nowhere else. As for the plot... well it's proper, a bit cheesy.. quite predictable but still I enjoyed it, exept that time when the devs decided to push a mandatory boss fight in - they really don't learn.\n\nAll in all I would recommend Thief to anyone who enjoys stealth games and already played Dishonored and Deus Ex to death but don't buy this for full price, wait for a 75% off and and enjoy the game for what it is while being mindful of its numerous faults. It's not a worthy sequel to Thief but something good enough to get the stealth itch scratched.","June 2, 2014","true","16.8"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","4"

It isn't the originals, no, but that doesn't make it bad. I personally found it to be very fun and very immersive - there's quite a lot to do, and a fair bit of loot and collectibles to find. It's honestly hard to get them all if you play without a guide or something.\nThe graphics and the simple flow of the game are quite beautiful, and really well done. I enjoyed the storyline, too - simple, but easy to follow, logical, and quite fun. Aside from the Thief-Taker General and such (Who you're kind of meant to hate), the only character I really despised was Erin. I just found her annoying.\nMost people's complaints are about Garrett not being the original Garrett, and that everybody hates his new voice, his new look, and the fact that he's shown to somewhat care for characters like Basso, the fence. Honestly, there isn't a problem with Garrett's new voice, and I reckon his new outfit is badass. Also, while there are a number of references to the older games, it's clear that this is a different Garrett - as in, he's seperated from the old Garrett by several centuries. He even makes an open reference to the 'old Garrett'. So, yes, he ISN'T meant to be the old Garrett, but he's still a shadey and edgy character like the old one.\n\nReally, this is a great game, and I honestly hope we get another one with the new Garrett (And no Erin, oh please). Old Garrett was lovable, but I see nothing wrong with this one.\n\n10/10","July 12, 2015","true","95.1"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

Ai is kinda stupid, loading between areas can be frustrating, controls and platforming can be a little akward at times. What holds the game up is good stealth mechanics, story and atmosphere, graphics, looting is a lot of fun, pick-pocketing can be really satisfiying, and there are tons side missions.\n\nGame allows you to play with 3 different styles; predator, ghost and opportunist. Predator is just killing everyone who dares to stop you, ghots is completing the quest without being seen and leaving no trace, opportunist... well I couldn't figure that out actually. It's about using the enviroment to your advantage or something.\n\nAi is just stupid. Predictable, blind idiots with memory of a fish. They still can see the little differences you made and react to them. They can look for corners, covers and closets and find you.\n\nStory is cool and captivating enough to see you till the end. There are good cutscenes and tons of lore in the world.\n\nMy biggeest issue is the loading screens in every 5 minutes. This game is supposed to be an openworld game. This was unnacceptable for me.

This Thief reboot has been in development for almost as long as my entire early childhood and usually that is never a good sign if history is the best judge. You just need to take a look at three other rather well know series that suffered from protracted development schedules, in-fighting and general nasty office politics and see how well that turned out for either of them. Duke Nukem Forever sunk faster than one of the main protagonists leaden sexist quips and Diablo 3 was initially a complete shambles and nothing the hardcore Diablo 2 market wanted at all. Sim City 4 still stands head and shoulders over it most recent sibling - the also apparently sequel free laden titled Sim City (2013). All of the above games also suffered from having the weight of history perched on their shoulders and we all know what a crushing affair that can be. Both Duke Nukem Forever and Diablo 3 faced uphill battles on all fronts. Would people still care about a much loved franchise when the passage of time was enough for a single person to go from young to old? Would game-play be sacrificed on the altar of innovation in an attempt to deliver a more modern gaming experience? I stll don't know how EA and Maxis managed to so royally ♥♥♥♥ up Sim City but that is another story for another time. Thief is likely to suffer from all of the above if you are a ardent series enthusiast but one I think the passage of time will be kinder to after a couple of patches and a passing of time.\n\nLet me start out by saying I have never played a Thief game before this release. Yes that is right, the entire series slipped past me although I was well aware of its existence. I remember seeing both Thief 1 and 2 in the stores during release and passing on both of them because I didn't feel they appealed to me at the time. I suppose that could be considered a great oversight but it has allowed me to approach this latest entry in the series with a fresh pair of eyes and none of that extra baggage that sequels get invariably saddled with. When taken as a complete stand alone adventure devoid of any links to the past I can honestly say I did enjoy it. The game has a great sense of place and atmosphere. The Victorian setting is beautifully evoked through Victorian-type architecture lined with dark and dirty cobbled streets, swirling bouts of mist that rise from the sewers below, puddles of dirty rain water and piles of refuse laying strewn about in dank and dark alleyways. Whilst playing Thief I was constantly reminded of the movie FROM HELL starring Johnny Depp. While there may be nothing as exciting as hunting for the real life Ripper in Thief what we get instead is a serviceable story of a master thief who seems to be more in need of chasing after his personality than the actual villain of the piece who literally ends up being a cardboard cutout of countless villains from the past and who wouldn't look out of place in Walt Disney's pantheon of nasties. For the most part the story is pretty engaging and keeps the gamer wanting to push on forward to see where the story is ultimately headed. I wasn't to mad about the supernatural element that gets introduced into the game about 2/3 in (although it is eluded to in the opening game cinematic), it puts its DirectX 11 features to good use and the voice acting is consistent with what you would expect to come from a big publishing house delivering a key lineup title. The soundtrack is also well implemented and not overblown and in your face (which is often the case with these big budgeted AAA titles).\n\nIt's not all unicorns farting rainbows in rose colored water however. As impressive as the city looks, when it comes to exploring it does feel very disjointed and it comes with one of the most useless gaming maps in all creation. I got so annoyed with the mini-map that eventually I just removed the map from the HUD entirely - ♥♥♥♥ it I would get there on blind luck alone - as following the HUD implemented map was more likely to lead me to hospital due to high blood pressure. The actual city you explore is literally hacked into bite size sections that require area loads when traversing and I found this to be quite jarring to be honest. The city also appears to suffer the fate of most digitally created worlds in that it is an almost lifeless affair. Houses you break into, where most of your looting gets done, appear to have no owners and most are the size of a shoe box. This is a pet peeve of mine. If you are going to try and go out your of your way by having a more immersive gaming world for God's sake please take the time to add characters to it which enable it to appear as something living and breathing. The Batman Arkham series is a big transgressor on this front as are other countless games with the most recent offender being Remember Me. What good is a setting without characters to give it life?\n\nAnother gripe would have to be the enemy A.I which is borderline mentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in most respects. Most of the enemy A.I can't see five feet in front of their noses especially when they call out for help or reinforcements and don't receive any when other A.I are meandering five feet away in all opposite directions.  Objects like bottles (throwing and accidentally knocking over) and broken pieces of shattered glass populate the world and exist to have you become more aware of your surroundings should you accidentally stumble on them thereby alerting enemies to your presence. The sad truth of all these precariously placed objects is that little but the wind reacts to them which is a shame. In fact I threw a bottle to create a diversion right in front of a guards face and he still sat there as if nothing had happened at all. The A.I also suffers from another extreme inconsistency where an enemy can spot you all the away from the shores of Antarctica when you are the middle of the South American Rain Forrest. These inconsistencies, depending on whether you will be playing this for stealth or simply just adventuring, may or may not be the deal breaker for you in terms of enjoyment. I am generally not a big fan of stealth-like games preferring to rather explore my worlds as the adventuring type but even I was getting slightly annoyed at certain turns in the game with the idiotic A.I. I should imagine if you are a stealth-like extremist this is going to drive you simply up the proverbial wall.\n\nAt turns downright gorgeous and breathtaking, scary and exciting, Thief can also be so old-fashioned, sparring, ridiculous, idiotic and frustrating. No, I don't imagine the game is going to set anyone's world on fire but Yes, if you are more accepting of the games foibles par-laid with its strengths you should still be able to have a relatively rocking good time with it. I have seen more critically revered games do a lot less for their victories. Thief is definitely not the failure some would make it out to be. While it may lack ambition and charm and a few more working parts such as better A.I and a more cohesive living and breathing digital world, it's certainly fun and enjoyable to play and is gorgeous to look at while evoking a striking sense of time and place. If you are more the adventuring kind of guy like I am then the odds are you will probably enjoy your short stay with the game.  Whilst certainly not an essential purchase, it's not a bad offering should you be looking at it when the sales come up.","April 28, 2014","true","28.9"," 97 of 174 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","97","174","0","9"

In other words, it feels constrained.\n\n3) If you play the main story and scour the maps for loot, you'll get about 20 hours of gameplay. Side missions could add several more hours.\n\n4) The one redeemable aspect is the high quality graphics. This game looks great on an Nvidia GTX 970. The graphics contribute to the atmosphere of the game.\n\n5) I suggest that you put aside any comparison to the previous Thief games, and play it with the eyes of a new player.\n\nNow, comparing Thief with Dishonored, Dishonored is definitely a better game.

Nice atmosphere and animations but the gameplay is where it falls short.\n\nEvery action you do is contextual, even shooting arrows. Makes me feel constricted in choice unlike the Original 2 Thief games which are full of open gameplay mechanics. Do you want to climb this ledge? Even though it looks climbable, you cannot do it! Do you want to move to this spot? You can't, you're blocked off even though you can easily move up the slope in real life. Want to jump? No. Ironically the most interactive mechanic is lock picking, which was purely contextual in the original Thief games.\n\nI loved lockpicking and framing. However, framing is impossible to do without the little indications. Lockpicking is possible without the HUD because Garrett has a special animation during lockpicking when he can pick, but not with framing. Both of these mechanics are really interactive and I wish all of the interactions you did in this game involved the mouse.\n\nGarrett has nice animations, but they detract from gameplay. When you grab loot you can't move for seconds at a time while Garrett looks at it. When you pick up special loot Garrett will take 6+ seconds to observe it and only by glitching can you do anything in between the animation times. The blackjack has a really good feel to it, similar to how Half Life 2's crowbar gives player feedback, its a shame that the blackjack is NOT useful in this game because you can only knock people out with a contextual button push that goes into a first or third person animation... instead of letting you do it your self. See the problem with contextual actions, developers? Same argument goes for the crowbar, the screwdriver, the wire cutters, and the razor blades.\nAnother note: Garretts movement animations are top notch and it's always how I imagined him moving in Thief 1 and 2. Except swooping, which is impossible to do in real life.\n\nThe world building and environments are very nice looking and even pretty nerve wrecking, especially the Asylum level, which is an obvious re-do of the Cradle level from Thief 3. It was still a great experience, infact I love it as much as the Cradle. My favorite level was easily the Brothel level, both parts.\nIt's a shame the story wasn't well told. Everything was a half ♥♥♥♥♥ idea from the start in terms of story and this Garrett is way too motivated to save the world and conflicts with his character in this game. It's all just a huge step down from the previous titles where Garrett was just unfortunate to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and kept getting sucked into the story even though it wasn't about him at all.\n\nThe graphics are top notch. Not much to be said here.\n\nIn Thief 1 and 2, the environment was a huge gameplay element. However, in Thief it is a big step down in some areas. Lighting in Thief both amazing and confusing, as this game uses dynamic lighting for the light/dark stealth element (similar to Thief 3), but it is hard to see what areas are light and dark for the light gem to function the way I want it. It just wasn't clear on where areas were dark or semi-dark or not dark since a light area and a dark area looks kind of similar unless there's orange light from fire sources.\nFloor types are almost gone in Thief, no more carpet/wood/grate/metal/grains/grass/marble floors like in Thief 1 and 2. Instead we have normal, wet, and "uh-oh there's glass nobody cleaned up". This is a huge step down from previous titles.\nSound design is weaker in this game, you can no longer lean against walls/doors to get sound information in the next room like in Thief 1/2 thanks to contextual leaning and since every floor is the same, it's hard to position guards with sound on vertical planes.\n\nIt's just so wrong that the older games in the series are the more advanced. I know that video games are in a huge slump right now in terms of gameplay design, but developers need to take more risks and I think the only developer who would take a risk for something great is Eidos, since they have the torches of the companies who DID take these risks like Looking glass studios and Ion Storm. Overall if you liked Thief 3 you'll like this game just as much.\n\n7/10, played it too safe.\nP.S. Please give Garrett's sword back!","October 31, 2014","true","38.5"," 40 of 68 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","40","68","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/239160/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","Thief follows the concept of Deadly Shadows (its predecessor released 10 years ago) with its City in the center of the game which is freely explorable between the story missions. The story consists of 8 chapters and while this number seems insufficient, these are great and interesting levels. There are two more clients in the City giving Garrett - our protagonist - additional missions and a guy in the local inn giving him several jobs.\n\nOverall, it took me 25 hours to complete all missions but I missed a lot of collectibles, secret areas and other loot. In fact, the missions have optional criteria which can yield some extra gold so it's worth checking them again. And once the game is complete you are free to move about in the City and replay the missions for the missing items.\n\nThe good stuff:\n\n-- Graphics. The game employs some excellent lighting and shadow effects. Since staying in the shadow away from the light sources is a must it is good to know the developers took this part of the game seriously. There are several cutscenes and not just Garrett but everybody else turning up in his story look very detailed and realistic. Accompanying voice acting is top notch. Locales during missions are diverse and interesting.\n\n-- Atmosphere. Hiding and stealing has never been more fun! I like how you can take almost everything in the game: golden saucers, candles, silver cutlery and all kinds of jewels. Robbing has never felt better! You can look for secret doors by pulling books on shelves or lockpick a safe that is hidden behind a painting. These are regular activities coupled with the disabling of several deadly traps.\n\n-- Equipment / AI. Rope arrows help you reach higher places, choke arrows eliminate dogs silently and water arrows will extinguish almost any fire you encounter. Enemies do notice them - guards can easily be distracted and the AI is clever enough to look for you even inside of a cupboard.\n\n-- Longevity. As I have already mentioned above it takes a while to complete all missions and it takes even more days to find every lootable item scattered across the City and its surrounding areas.\n\nThe bad stuff:\n\n-- Optimisation issues. Before being able to properly play Garrett's story I needed to tweak the game a little. In fact, it took me a while to realise it was not my rig that caused the problem; some effects are simply not worth being turned on. Interestingly, most of them were shadow-related and I barely noticed anything when I turned them off. The game looks just as good and the stuttering - for the most part - ceased to exist. I hate when I have to look up numerous websites for tweaking advice.\n\n-- Audio issues. Sometimes you hear people speaking but you have no idea where the voices come from. Since you run on rooftops or ledges next to windows I gathered these could be people indoors. But then again sometimes you hear them as if they were next to you and at other times you don't hear them but the subtitles are shown. Occasionally more than one citizen speaks and the audio overlaps. Pretty annoying at times.\n\n-- Stuttering / loading screens / hub system. The hub system the game uses requires a lot of time to get used to. The map can be annoying and you do have to remember if it is a door or a window that takes you to the next district. But these areas are not that big so I did not really get why the game was divided up into so many sections. Loading, therefore, is common, especially when a mission is complete and you have to get back to your client to terminate it for good. He, of course, stays at the other end of the map.\n\nSometimes you have to go ground level to find a pile of boxes that is the only means to access another area... this was annoying as hell! And once the next chapter begins Garrett always finds himself next to his Clock Tower hideout. This is the central part of the City and loading it up takes a lot of time and stuttering, as well. Some of the cutscenes also suffer from loading time - until it is done low resolution textures will appear for many secs.\n\n-- Gameplay issues / nuisances. Garrett's blackjack. Really? A melee weapon to stun enemies usable in combat, as well? Where is his sword? Or a knife? The game already labels you a Predator if you kill someone with a bow from a distance. So, why cannot we do that close-up? Sometimes I felt like going with the failed stealth and dispatching the attacking guards option but when I saw how slowly it can be done with the blackjack I loaded up a previous checkpoint immediately instead of wasting my time with the soldiers. The developers should have looked at Dishonored.  With all the excellent arrow types Garrett just looks lame with his blackjack.\n\nMoving can also be difficult at times. Sometimes Garrett jumps and grabs a rope in front of him while other times he falls and dies. Long jumps after running can only be used where the developers intended them to be used. Many times you'd like to jump down but Garrett crouches and looks down.\n\nOverall, I liked Thief. But I found its stuttering, its optimisation issues very irritating at first. Its hub system - the navigation in the City - and its combat with the blackjack took me several hours to accept. I expected more from such a remake and from Eidos. I wish they had looked at other games such as Dishonored and borrowed some good ideas. Or simply look at the Dark Project from 1998 - the first Thief game that had no issues with Garrett wielding a sword.\n\nI was not interested in the Bank Heist mission and Forsaken challenge DLCs, therefore, I cannot comment on those. I do not like that some of the content are intentionally pulled so that it can be sold later on.\n\nThief could have been much better. It is not a bad game but not a very good game, either. Once you have gotten used to its nuisances you can immerse yourself in the City's steampunk atmosphere. If you achieve that, long hours of gameplay are guaranteed. My rating for the game is 6/10 at best.","November 26, 2014","true","25.1"," 55 of 96 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","55","96","0","1"

The game itself is not as enjoyable as other stealth based games. The city itself feels narrow and linear the stealth mechanics are some what fine but not the best. The main quest is confusing and i find myself wondering as to why to i care about Garrett when he comes off as a cross between Batman and The Crow some of his dialogue come of as cringeworthy. The puzzles you are required to do to obtain a certain item are excruciating and could have been handled better.\n\nThis game had the potential to be great especially since i don't mind stealth games but i ask myself where is the loot where is the fun of doing these easy missions that take only minutes to complete. You don't have to kill anyone and by pass the level with ease. I wanted a challenge instead i found myself thinking that i could be doing something else with my time.\n\nWhat is great about the game are the visuals especially with the lighting of certain levels and the city itself looks like a real filthy and damp city and certainly keeps you immersed for a while. The weapons are creative for the most part but i felt there could have been more effort put into it.\n\nI would recommend the game if it goes for cheap on a steam sale but in my opinion it's worth a try just don't pay full price or you'll feel ripped off.","June 15, 2015","false","2.4"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","19","29","0","1"

Unlike the older games, it is actually possible to fight and kill enemies, and be REWARDED! Unlike the title would sugest, you dont need to sneak around to suceed, as long as you make it out of every mission with enough gold to buy more arrows, your can keep shooting with your bow, instead of blackjacking your way in and out, unseen. And The blackjack, Garrett's most reliable "tool" is not even used to knockout guards, its used as a replacement for a sword, or dagger. Paths around the areas are much to obvious. The map is TOO easy to use, I prefered it old style, where you had to guess where you were. Garrett's right eye seems to have lost its greenish glow. And Focus, whether or not theres an option to diable it, ITS WRONG! Focus is practially "Eagle Vision"(Assassins Creed Series) with a different name. all Focus does is simplify the game beyond how simple it already is. I was given high expectations from the hype (as little as there was) about this game, only to have them ruined, There was potential, it just wasnt used correctly, or even at all. I would not suggest buying this game if your a returning fan, but if you've never played the series, play the first, second, and maybe 3rd game. I'm disapointed that a near $50 when to this game, and the only part of the amount I enjoyed, was the pre-order bonuses for other games. Don't get me wrong, this game did somethings right, and the graphics are "Enjoyable".

I think to myself, Thats strange she dosn't look 14 though, the super heavy eye shadow makes me suspisious. Garret is going to need to card her before anything happends I thought. Hmmmm Garret's voice sounds old but he is saying things a 16 year old would think are stupid. I console my self after deciding the writers were 12.\n\nThe side kick is whining about how Obi-wan dosn't understand her. Now she has killed a guard with her claw thing that is clearly an overworld item and I hope to myself she won't need to die for me to get it. We are half way into a dangerous heist and she has a big problem with Garret having a problem with her killing. Mature people would have this argument later or abort. I have enough in my pocket to call it a worthwile trip and these two clearly have history whats the hurry.\n\nThe combonation of her current borderline age and the idea that garret knew her even younger has made me uncomfortable. I decide to show solidarity in her murder by hiding all the bodies and knocking out everyone I see. This should drasticaly midigate the effects of her "mistake" and mend the frayed nerves.\n\nI meet her on the roof and she has killed again. Given it is the one part of the roof that was fully lit and there is no place for the gaurd to have gotten up here let alone patrol I doubt she had a choice. Garret confronts her and she pulls a full on dark side monolouge.  Woah, must be adreniline. She is probably going to feel a serious guilt hangover later and seems barely stable now. She moves ahead but clearly wants to finish the heist with me and is using the idea of a race to keep her distance but goad me to keep up. Clearly I need to go on for her sake and if she breaks down she might get hurt or killed.\n\nWhen I start to note that captial P pride will be a big part of her character giant white text appears over her head and she freezes.\n\nSTEAL THE CLAW THINGY [E]!\n\nNo. Why? I have not seen a single place I needed the claw thing. I don't want the thing. She has clearly grown dependant on it to get arround and to defend herself. It also represents her advantage over Garret psyologicaly. The chip on her shoulder is a mile wide and stealing her tools is a heinous betrayal. Garret was worried about a body up here on the roof so clearly I can't knock her out or strand her here in the middle of a mansion grounds. Garret is not her mentor or guardian they are partners in a now double homicide crime.\n\nMy pocket has a month of living jangling in it and a necalce made entirely of rubies. I don't need this. If I am woried about myself I should quit. If I am worried about her I should try to calm her down and make sure she gets through this alive. Its at this point in my crisis that I realize she hasn't moved at all. She is trapped half way through an anamation where she is squeseing past a box. She hasn't said a thing this whole time. She isn't even breathing. It's astounding that there is no speech or falure condition for taking this long. She dosn't react when I shoot water on her head or toss a fragle glass cup.\n\nThe only things to keep me company on this roof are a bloodless corpse of a guard, an uncariteristicaly bright light, and a white cursor over her butt displaying:\n\nBETRAY YOUR COMPANION [E]\n\nSCAR HER TRUST [E]\n\nSTEAL THE CLAW [E]\n\nI couldn't bring myself to go any farther.

I was disappointed in this attempt. I like the engine for the most part. The tools are pretty good (aligned with the originals fairly well). I thought the story line was alright if a little vague and a bit odd. But, games of this nature tend to be a bit odd. The story line does seem a little patchy, with several holes in it. But, I'd like to think that it is so they can make new games filling in those blanks.\n\nSadly, if the reviews I've been seeing are the deciding factor, I fear this franchise may have come to an abrupt and untimely end! If that's the case, it's REALLY unfair! The stealth gameplay that was truly initiated with the Thief series is the one style of game play that I really enjoy. I hate games that essentially force you into running headlong into a hail of bullets and hope you can kill everybody before you die. Then hope you can find enough med kits to recover enough health points for the next assault. That's just stupid tactics. (But, that's another issue)\n\nDown to more specifics.\nAs I said, I like the basic engine. The stealth worked well in my opinion although I'd like to see all the paths to different locations be two way, not just one way. (Minor annoyance)\nI'd like more opportunities to acquire more of the points for adding to the special abilities.\n\nUnfortunately, I felt somewhat frustrated at different points in the game. The most notable is the end-game "boss" fight. It's really not a fight. The things I don't like about the end is... first, the idea is NOT to hurt the "boss" because you're trying to save her, yet, just one or two of her flashes of light can kill you. Second, the objects you have to gather are spread out and hard to see, making them almost impossible to acquire without getting killed. The rest of the game was challenging enough to make it interesting most of the time, at least for me. But, the ending frustrated me to the point where I had to walk away before I punched my monitor! Using a walkthrough I found, I'm going to try and complete it, but I'm not sure if I'll play it all the way through again.\n\nBottom line: I would only recommend this game at a discounted price. I normally like the products Eidos produces. But, with this one, I regret paying the full, pre-release price for it.\n\n\nDear EIDOS,\nIf you read this... I'm begging you, PLEASE try again! Only, stick a little more to the style of the original series. I understand you wanted to be a little more realistic. But, this game series was originally set in somewhat of a mystical time. So, you could get away with mixing a little mysticism with science and still be believable.\n","May 26, 2014","true","114.5"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","2"

The games were great fun finding your own way to sneak into a building or residence, and taking the target loot from them. The Thief games have always made shadows your friend, and in many ways was a pioneer with lighting in games. Players use shadows to hide from the guards and hoping they don’t see you. The series for the most part has almost always been about stealth and not confrontation, and this is no different in Eidos Montreal’s take on the game.Players take the role of Garrett, a master thief, and he has been hired to steal the Primal Stone. Along the way we run into Erin, another thief, and discover that stealing the Primal Stone is a two person job. Once you reach the location of the stone, however, some bad things happen and Erin is presumed dead. During this mission players are given very easy to follow and understand tutorials, helping players to understand how the game mechanics work.Once the prologue mission is over, Garrett must make his way to the clock tower, and there the game truly begins.The world of Thief is a fully imagined fantasy world with a dash of industrial revolution. It’s a dark, very compact city making traversing the roofs fairly easy and fun, making you feel like an actual thief. Garrett’s handler, Basso, sends the master thief out to steal various objects around the city. At this point Garrett can make his way to the mission point in the city any way he wants or just break into a house to steal some trinkets  — just make sure the watch isn’t around. Once Garrett reaches the starting point of a mission, there is a brief cut scene and then the mission starts.Garrett has many tools to use while sneaking around. Tools for making distractions, putting out light sources, stunning guards, etc. Aside from his hands, he can use items like his bow with water arrows to put out light sources from a distance, or rope arrows to help him climb. His blackjack is used to knock out guards, the claw is used to hook onto ledges and help pull him up out of range of guards. As items are taken during missions, they are automatically turned into gold, and then can be used to upgrade or buy new tools.Sneaking around during missions is extremely satisfying, especially when sneaking up on guards and relieving them of their wallets, keys, or whatever else they have in their possession. Players will feel very satisfied when successfully avoid particularly well placed guards by using all the tools in their arsenal. When guards think they see you an eye appears over their heads, the eye slowly fills up as long as you are in their field of view. Once it fills, the guard has seen you and he alerts other guards around him. Once guards are alerted, Garrett can run and try to hide, or fight the guards. Combat in Thief is extremely clumsy and difficult and for the most part if you engage in more than one target at a time, which makes it obvious that Garrett is a master thief not a master swordsman.One of the tools that Garrett has in his arsenal are empty bottles. They can be found in the environments and thrown to distract guards. But be careful, if you do it too many times in the same area, the guards will be alerted to your presence. A big complaint with this mechanic in the game is that more than once I have come across a couple of empty bottles that I could not take, and Garrett can only carry one bottle at a time.A nice touch within the game’s environment is the placement of notes and other objects that can be used to find loot. For example, early in the game players come across a note written by a voyeur detailing where a safe in a house is. Overhearing conversations can also reveal details on where valuables can be found in the city.This Thief review is based on the PC version of the game, so the issue may not be present in other versions, but there seems to be issues with the audio.When ducking out of the rain, such as breaking into a jeweler’s store to relieve them if their product, the noise of the rain gets dulled just like it should. The annoyance comes from if there is a window open there is no gradual increase in the sound of the rain the closer you get to the window. The sound of the rain is either there or not depending on how close to the window you are. Similarly, when eavesdropping outside a window, the conversation happening on the other side of the glass is heard clear as day, even across the street.When spotted, a tense music theme starts playing to create a sense of urgency to get out of sight and hide. However, the music can be a burden, also popping up while you are sneaking around keeping your ears open for guard’s footsteps. A stealth game like this should be quiet with no music unless spotted, as a thief’s ears are one of his best assets.Overall Thief is an enjoyable experience that deserves to be played and explored if you are a fan of stealth games.","February 24, 2015","true","124.3"," 57 of 101 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","57","101","2","4"

The story is as generic as it can get, it feels like a ripoff of Dishonored and it has a lamer villain than Turok Evolution's Cpt. Bruckner.

One of the most important aspects for a game like this is completely botched.\n\nMost of the missions are okay, with the highlight being the Bank Heist DLC mission, though it definitely losses some steam after a copy of the famous Craddle mission from Deadly Shadows.\n\nGo play the first two games instead of this, the second game has a bigger and better bank heist mission, heck, go play Deadly Shadows if you're new to the series.

I loved Dishonored. I love <your favorite stealth game here>. I love stealth overall, hiding unseen and unheard and waiting for right moment to do what is needed to do :)\n\nNew Thief? It is not so bad, but it is not so good also. New Thief ... just it is.\n\nPros:\n\n- very nice atmospheric stylized graphic\n- very nice architectonic of whole city\n- possibility to tweak gaming UI (aka HUD) to get feel like in old Thief games (you can turn all dumb "action key" notices, you can turn AI awareness icon etc.)\n- possibility to tune your difficulty to your needs (to be honest, on Master difficulty with HUD all turned off you could start feel fun from playing this game, everything feels almost OK)\n- very strong immersion into the game due to visible hands and feets of player character Garret\n\nCons:\n\n- VERY, VERY, VERY poorly optimised game, long loading times and with 1GB GPU forget about textures higher than "lower"\n- after short time very annoying action animations of opening windows/squeezing somewhere between crates to get to other part of city\n- VERY glitchy sound engine. Game like this should rely on sound, moreover human eye is easy to trick, but not so ear (i.e. you can hear someone very loudle, his steps, his speech, but he is far away, much more than it sounds or imagine two characters standing each together having dialogue in large hall, one sounds like in large hall and other not etc.)\n- STORY? WTF? You are Garret. You had an amnesia for last year. No word about who is who, story is dull and very boring and something you can't just believe. You are here in city to do your job - just bounty thief, nothing more\n- sometimes the visibility meter shows you are completely hidden in shadow, but reality on screen makes you feel like "guard you can't see mee in the middle of light flooded space?" or so\n- all main story levels are strictly corridor designed\n- VERY POOR vertical movement freedom for player. Good old rope arrows are here, but there are only few and significantly marked spots in the city you can use for rope arrow. Also no possibility to recycle used rope arrow\n- VERY POOR vertical movement freedom for player again - you see some crates under some balcony or platform and you think "i could get there easily"? Forget about it. There are so many unclimbable objects or locations and is pretty obvious THIS IS THE WAY developers controls your way through game\n- you can loot citizens flats where is nobody inside houses and all civilians in streets one can count on fingers of both hands\n- visuals are nice dark, but after while dark atmosphere of city is gone somehow\n- sometimes AI is so smart - when guard sees torch or candles to blow out he comes back and lights it again, same with open doors - when guard sees opened door which should be closed he will go investigate. But sometimes doors doesn't matter and same with torches/candles (most curious situation is when you shoot blunt arrow to someone who carries a torch; he just drops torch /torch goes out/ and AI continues with suspicion in dark and never picks up torch from ground and never lights it back)\n\nThief looks very nice and just WOW! when you enter the game, when you see it for first one or two sights/gaming sessions. But after while, when you conquered game mechanics one can see how stupid and how simply is level design on most places. And i'd rather spent gaming time by doing all side/client jobs in the city, rather than continuing in main story.\n\nAlso for older Thief fans - there is no connection with Thief world with Hammerites and Keepers, Mechanists and Pagans - story of new Thief is ... just poor and very uncomplex and just very unbelievable. Only a few things remind old Thief games - Basso and guards saying "one should walk the streets with bronze hammer". This is all what one gets to remind older Thief games, which had very strong story.\n\nConclusion? IMHO wasted potential. New Thief could very easily become GOTY, if done properly. But if you like stealth and if you like dark visual you can get it for less than 10€, go get it, you will enjoy it.","June 24, 2014","true","56.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

I'm awful with scary games, and most people would say it wasn't even scary so take that as you will. Having never played the original Theif games, I can't compare it to the others. I really liked the shadow concept, the stealth is a lot different than Dishonored and I found myself throwing bottles at people to knock them out which I thought was hilarious and I never tried that in Dishonored because of blink. The swoop concept is the same thing but less fun and weirdly executed, sometimes it just didn't work and felt awkward. I'm sure there is audio problems in this game as well. Focus was pointless, the game was not bad. If I didn't have framerate troubles I'd say it was definately decent, but Dishonored was still better.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/recommended/239160/","klarden","Kain Klarden","http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/","1232 products in account","Wow, where do I even start? I guess, by saying that despite a LOT of dissapointments, bad design decisions, few rare but horrible glitches, the game is good. It really is. When thinking about what I'm going to say about the game while at about mid-point of the game, I was thinking of "really good". But the last few levels are quite badly done, so "good" it is.\nOne thing that surprisingly Squenix decided to be quite about, and I really have no idea as to why, is that Thief is, in fact, not a reboot but a sequel. It happens in the same City as before, even if Garrett is a different character. Just several centuries later. And yes, I do consider this fact to be important, because trying to learn more about the game world, the surprisingly rich and intriguing world, of the original trilogy after the trilogy ended was one of the most enjoyable things in this game. Which is not surprising, since the story the new Garrett is involved in is absolutely abyssmal. The concept behind the story is more or less okay, some of the characters are intriguing, but the dialogue, the feel of the world and it's inhabitants are just flat at best, and the story simply goes nowhere. At first, after seeing Rhianna Pratchett's name in the credits I thought I had the answer as to why this happened, but apparently even she wasn't really working on the game and was involved rather briefly and in the early and mid stages of development.\nAnd the fact that this happens is really a shame, since some of the characters and some of the hooks are pretty nicely done, and visually The City looks nice. Voice actor for the new Garrett was good, reminding of Stephen Russell's delivery, but at the same time creating a different character. Music, composed by Luc St. Pierre according to credits, is actually very nicely done and reminiscent of the fantastic score of the original trilogy done by Eric Brosius. Not quite the same mix of weird creepy and industrial ambient with trip-hop and industrial metal sounding stuff, but very close and, because of the fully dynamic nature of music in the game, feels more natural and enhances the gameplay.\nThe gameplay itself, though, is where you start asking questions. Now, some of the ideas were nice.They did improve on the Deadly Shadows' claustrophobic City - it's bigger, has much more stuff to do, but at the same time, still fell in the same trap of pointlessly boring backtracking, "upgrades/tools" (think climbing gloves from TDS), which you absolutely have to get, and do it almost immidiately, making the idea of buying them in the first place almost redundant. And added to this a really big problem of doors and other closed things re-locking after every mission and even side-mission (client job type, not just a mini-quest thing) for no apparent reason, rather then to just waste more player time.\nI also did like how now Garrett had to physically interact with everything - be it grabing loot, opening doors, flipping switches and etc. It means, no "telepathic" interactions, more thinking about where any interaction places you and how long each interaction takes when thiking about guards or other enemies around you. To somehow balance this idea out the movement became much faster and quiter, though, but actually not completely silent when crouched and on "loud surfaces", as it was in TDS. Plus, the "swoop" move is a really nice idea for the kind of gameplay the game created.\nThe bad thing about this swoop, however, is that it completely overrides the jump button. Instead, all the jumping in the game is context sensitive and if you understand that the jump should be easily possible, but the game doesn't want you to jump there - you just can't. It, along with a few other "context sensitive" animations restricts the game much more than one might want to. But, at the same time, it doesn't matter, because the problems with gameplay lie much deeper than that.\nThe actual problem with the gameplay is that, despite understanding it and getting it almost 100% right in their previous project DX: Human Revolution, the developers completely misunderstand the core idea behind Thief's gameplay. Which is not that far from what Deus Ex gameplay is, in it's core. Because Thief, even TDS, had very simple rules during missions - no cutscenes, at no point the controls are taken away from the player, all that happens in the level happens because of the set and, if not bothered or rarely scripted, never changing character routes and player interaction with it, and the level as a whole. That's it - if there's a "cinematic action moment" during the level, it's because the player screwed up somewhere and alerted the enemies, not because the script says that there is a cutscene, during which Garrett gets discovered and it cues into an actions running away scene. And, because of this "forced storytelling" approach in the new Thief, levels are much much less open ended. And, you know what - with this approach it is understandable, that jump button got cut and rope arrows work as tools with very specific use in specific places (think more Tomb Raider 2013, than classic Thief, hell even less than climbing gloves from TDS). There's no point in having normal jumping and proper rope arrows, if the levels are not structured in the same vein, as in the original trilogy, now is it?\nAnd it becomes painfully obvious, when the game tries to directly reference those unforgettable missions from original trilogy. Sure, one of the levels does look like that incredible mission in T2 with Angelwatch tower, but the magic of the original was in how huge, varied and almost completely non-scripted that mission was. How breathtaking that run across rooftops was. Here it's just a super linear level with a forced "run away" sequence jammed in the middle for no good reason. And they try to do their own Robbing the Cradle. And it is good. But where the original in TDS was brilliant because it worked just as a normal mission, but with no enemies at the start and with almost completely silent and frighteningly deadly enemies later, the mental sylum mission in the new Thief feels more like a first person horror game, a lot of free ones of which are constantly been created lately. With jump scares and horribly banal twist to the history of the place, where the original was just a sad and scary place, which got really unlucky at some point.\nAlso, there are two "boss" fights. Yep. Developers who got severely burned by including boss fights in ther previous game did it again. And while Deus Ex actually had boss fight encounters from the very first game, Thief never did. Now, granted, you're not required to fight, hence the quote marks. And the second one actually works much more like the "boss" encounter at the end of the TDS - more of a stealth puzzle than anything else. The first one, however, is ridiculously badly done, especially for ones playing on highest difficulty with several custom difficulty settings. The fight can be avoided, but the boss is so erratic and his attacks have such a wide spread, that it's just painful to try and avoid him. Especially if the game does a rare reloading glitch, where the game just goes to a black screen after the loading and has to be force quit. And since I mentioned glitches - the other really bad and very noticeble glitch is AI reset when reloading - sometimes all the NPCs would just return to their starting places on the location and do the starting things they might do upon reloading, which may make some levels almost impossible to complete with full stealth/no knockouts approach.\nBut since I've mentioned custom difficulty - it is a nice, but, to be honest, pointless thing that will, most likely, just make your playthrough more painful. They set restrictions, which give you "points" for leaderboards, but that's it - points, not multipliers, so there is a max of 1300 and Top of the leaderboard is full of those.\nSo yeah. Lots of bad things, but a good stealth game.","March 14, 2014","true","32.6"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","19","30","0","0"

Aside the fact this is not a title for legacy Thief fans, its just a poorly executed in itself.\n\nBeautiful level design and detail, but feels like a benchmark program that you have been dropped into and can walk about in. You can't actually do that much with the environments around you that are 'thief like' - the open world-ish side to the game that it tries to pull off is a lie.\n\nStealth and AI is acceptible but again you are confined by the level design; for example, In the open city Stonemarket, there is a side mission to steal something from a local doctors. To get in you must open a window, inside there are 2 guards, 1 civilian NPC but you are tied into 2 rooms and one corridor... if you are seen and need to hide... where do you go? You can't dash out the window... you are running into room 1, then chased into room 2, then into the corridor, dodge, back to room 2, back to room 1... your ♥♥♥♥ed basically. To open the window you have to mash the use key, which you can't do in (shudder) 'combat mode' anyway... Who thought this was a good idea? Garrett, the master thief, trapped by a window he just opened two minutes earlier... Really?\n\nEvery action is a cumbersome longwinded animation of Garretts busy hands, rummaging through drawers, opening doors, peeping round corners, lunging up rooftops, opening randomly placed wardrobes and cupboards to save the game.... on top of not being able to quickly open anything like a total tard, actually makes you feel like a bumbling gimp in a tight leather suit, not some master thief.\n\nI tried to like it, I started the game again and again and I just can't bring myself like it... Other than the impressive visuals, the gameplay, well its just a bit ♥♥♥♥. I don't find any fun or satisfaction in sneaking about or climbing up the clearly marked white bits of the city.\n\nDevelopers should have kept it simple, stuck to the roots of Thief 1,2 and even 3 a bit more. Made it a quicker, more punchy and fast paced sneak in, sneak out. Risk vs equipment vs partolling guards.\n\nThief fans of old, definitely avoid. New thief players - Honestly? Buy the Dishonored collection, despite being a different game it does the whole thiefy thang a lot better than this.\n","December 26, 2014","false","11.0"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","19","30","0","6"

Take any of those elements and add depth with leveling skills or abilities and you have a deep, worth-while experience. They all add together to create the illusion that you are actually a thief and that you are responsible for everything that happens. This game seems to lack the depth and freedom necessary to hold up to those standards which have already been established in games well over ten years old. I can't reccommend this game knowing that there are others out there which have nailed the burglar experience.","July 7, 2014","false","0.2"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coyoterys/recommended/239160/","coyoterys","Captain Serious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coyoterys/","286 products in account","I'll give this version of Thief a luke warm recommendation.  It does a lot of things right, but the things it does wrong can make for a frustrating experience.\n\nLet's start with the good things.  This game is beautiful.  The graphics, environments, lighting and particle effects are amazing.  It would have been nice for a little more variety in locations, but the environments are amazingly detailed.   The mission levels design is excellent.  You'll find many paths to navigate to reach your goal, and will be hard pressed to find 100% loot each mission.  Even when I thought I was being very thoroughly obsessive searching for loot, I've always come up short, and a few times nowhere close to 100%.  The looting animation is really well done.  You'll feel like a sneaky thief as Garrett lightly plucks items off unsuspecting persons and rummages through desks and cabinets.\n\nOne final thing well done in this version of Thief is the options menu.  This is how all PC games should be treated.  The amount of customization is insane.  Not just video and sound, but game play features that allow you to find an exact level of difficulty outside the confines of the Easy, Normal, and Hard presets.\n\nLet's now discuss some flaws / complaints.  The first being the double edged sword that is the hub city.  The hub city is where you'll do all your side jobs, and navigate to the locations where all the story missions load.  It is both beautifully detailed and intricately designed, but infuriatingly frustrating to navigate until you've learned your way through the various shortcut locations.  The map / mini-map are relatively useless as it will put a marker at your destination, but show no path to get there.  I enjoy freedom to do missions my own way, but a little pathway help through the hub city would've saved me a lot of time and frustration.\n\nThe second flaw is poorly executed positional sound.  In a stealthy game sound is probably the most important feature besides the shadow mechanics.  Many times in Thief I'd hear a loud conversation as if somebody was near, only to look and see nobody in sight.  Conversely there were times I was spying through peek holes and could barely hear the conversation.  This inconsistency makes it difficult to depend on sound to detect where guards are, and you become strictly reliant on visual contact.\n\nThe third issue I noticed was broken or poorly programmed AI.  There were times I saw enemy patrols stop their route and stand forever without moving again.  At first I thought it was intended, but after reloading a save game the same guard that was standing still once again started patrols.   This bug frequently caused me to lose ghost status, as they'd often stop exactly where I needed to go.  I started losing my patience waiting to see if guards will resume patrols, and elected to change style by forgoing being undetected for a swift opportunistic knockout.\n\nMy final issue is minor complaining about mechanics and story.  While I'm glad they totally removed the Quick Time Events, I'm not sure the platform segments were a necessity either.  It felt like a weak attempt to copy Assassin Creed, or Tomb Raider, while the story felt like a copy of Dishonored.  This story was to bland for Thief.  I wanted Hammerites and Pagans, and we got city guard by the truck load.  I usually get into a games story and soak in all details of backstory, but I had a difficult time with Thief.   Half the time I couldn't remember why I was doing the mission, except for looting as much as possible.  And I literally said, "What just happened?" at the final cutscene.\n\nSo,  all in all if you can tolerate a few bugs and frustrations Thief has some memorable cool missions despite a shallow bland story.  It's definitely worthy of the current $15 sales price.","June 12, 2014","true","27.7"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordWeh/recommended/239160/","LordWeh","Lord Weh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordWeh/","344 products in account","Sadly, Thief is one of the worst games I've ever played.\n\nI wanted to love it, the originals were very formative to my gaming tastes back in the day, and I loved the work Eidos-Montreal did on Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Unfortunately, somehow events have conspired to produce something so poor I wouldn't recommend it if it were free.\n\nNow, clearly as a fan of the original games I'm disappointed by the disconnect and huge disservice that the game plays to the Thief lore and world, but lets put that aside for this review. Those gripes have likely been well-trodden on forums and review boards all over the 'net. Instead, I'll focus on the game as it exists outside of 'Thief' cannon.\n\nMechanically, the game is average to poor. The stealth mechanics are servicable enough, although the controls are fairly clunky (I played with keyboard and mouse). Sneaking about feels relatively fluid, but with levels so linear they'd probably better be described as two-pronged corridors, there's little need for inventive stealth. This isn't a game that respects your options and input, it's a game that expects you to jump through hoops. Your objectives are telegraphed in stages, almost corridor-by-corridor, and there's little room to explore beyond these objectives within the main missions. I understand there are side missions, but with main missions as dull and poorly written as I experienced, I couldn't think of a reason to want to wander into side mission territory.\n\nThen we come to the worst crime the game commits; its narrative (again, even disregarding how it fits into the Thief universe). The story focuses on Garrett, 'master thief', who starts the game annoyed by an old protogé, Erin. She's loud, petulent and obnoxious. I think we're supposed to think she's 'cool' and 'edgy' however, as the game tries to set her up as something of a damsel in distress. When she 'dies' during the prologue you breathe a sigh of relief, only to find that she crops up constantly throughout the game as an angst-ridden ghost spurring you to save her for some reason despite her constant angsty objections. This teenage angst is somehow supposed to be inspiring and a driving factor, but it just constantly grates and grinds.\n\nThe cutscenes feel strange and out-of-place, like they were rushed and unfinished. The game feels like it was scrunched together from several disparate parts... there's an item called the primal (which causes the angsty ghostiness), somehow it's related to a book and a ring (which isn't really explained), there's a giant arc being constructed at some point (which is also never really explained), and there's a plan to 'bring order' to the city through some ritual that is left so vague as that you seem to be expected to write a reason in yourself. It looks like it might involve robots, but who knows, really (and I've completed it). The ending feels like it comes out of nowhere, randomly introducing a few new parts that are given no explanation, and the actual ending cutscene doesn't make any sense, simply leaving you with the credits rolling as though you're not supposed to expect an actual conclusion to the story.\n\nThe game suffers from constant continuity errors within it's own plot, the world itself feels quite shallow despite looking interesting, and none of the characters feel like they have lives and goals outside of their simple existence to spout off cheap one-liners and clumsy exposition in cutscenes. There's a level of immaturity in the writing and content that feels like a child's idea of what an adult game should include; the frequent swearing feels like it's trying to prove the game is gritty and serious, there's a level designed around the cheap thrills of viewing people having sex, talking about sex, and being naked in a brothel, and one of the villains genuinely has a moustache that I reckon he twirls when you're not looking. Now some of those may sound like amusing positive points... but trust me, they're really not.\n\nFurthermore, there are multiple s-shaped narrow corridors you must squeeze through, halfway through these there is ALWAYS a fallen wooden beam which must be moved via a button-mashing quick-time event. These are used to thinly disguise a loading screen, giving the game time to load the next miniscule forked corridor. These are repeated constantly and shamelessly, you recognise what is happening by the time you reach the second s-shaped corridor, becoming an immersion-destroying reminder that you're playing a subpar game and destroying any hope of creating an engaging atmosphere.\n\nIn general very little care and attention to meaningful world-building has been made, instead the developers seem content to use cliché shorthand techniques and shallow characters to create an 'epic' feel to a game that doesn't do anything to deserve that feeling, leaving you cheated. Overall, the game is an uninspired missmash of disparate elements, mediocre mechanics and terrible level design all wrapped around a dire plot that never quite connects together. I wish there was something worthwhile in here, but the whole experience grew more and more painful the further in I got.\n\nPerhaps the only thing I can say in the positive; there's some nice visual design to the city itself.\nOther than that, I'd recommend avoiding the game, no matter how cheap it gets.","January 23, 2015","false","7.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fuzzman/recommended/239160/","fuzzman","Fuzzman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fuzzman/","167 products in account","Thief is a game that exists between two worlds--the world of classic PC gaming and the realm of contemporary trends. Credit must be given to the developers for striking a balance between the two. The more imporant question, however, is whether this balance accomplishes the lofty goals and expectations that it set out to achieve. My answer is: somewhat.\n\nThe mechanics of the game do take some time to become acquainted with, even for veteran PC players. This is often the case for many games, simply adjusting to the movement, flow, pacing, control schemes, and rules of the game. Once the player gets the hang of things, it becomes slightly second-nature to explore the game world. In full disclosure, certain aspects of the controls and mechanics do occasionally disobey the player's command, though far less than some of the other contemporary games out there.\n\nIn terms of visuals, audio, and mood and tone, the game is mostly successful. It looks good and plays smoothly enough with properly attuned graphics options. The audio, which is a significant component of the game, does its job, though nothing stands out as impressive or iconic. There were times when certain sound effects, in response to player actions, were too loud and distracting--particularly for a stealth game. As for mood and tone, the game's setting and world feel alive and fleshed out, though perhaps not to the same degree as its forebearers.\n\nThe plot and characters were a weaker aspect. While a reboot, essentially, the character of Garrett felt off for that of a master thief. The original Garrett was someone that preferred to be alone to ply his trade, whereas this Garrett is a man that is more sympathetic to others, more trusting, and less of a loner. Old fans will find it jarring, but new fans should enjoy it well enough. The Thief series was never strong in the story department, and this entry is no different. Most of the charm comes in the details of the world and its inhabitants--notes, rumors, and environmental cues. Those are the rich tidbits that make the game interesting. Veteran players will miss the tropes, jargon, and factions of the old series, but there are subtle, silent hints of the setting's history.\n\nReplayability is strong. The game allows the player to revisit missions in an attempt to steal more items and attain a higher score than before. Many hours can be spent in the game, at various paces set out by the player. The difficulty ranges, and the player can customize difficulty options prior to starting a game. Some mechanics and user interface options are entirely optional, which is a boon for players, old and new.\n\nAll in all, Thief is a very fun game, though it will not scratch the itch of the old games in exactly the same way. Much effort clearly went into this game's creation, and there are many successes with few failures. I recommend this game to PC gamers that appreciate stealth, creativity, and a deliberate pace. Just know that it won't win any awards.","June 28, 2014","true","48.9"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

A beloved franchise that is quite dear to my heart!  I'm a huge fan of the older Thief games, which I played multiple times over the years ever since the release of The Dark Project in 1999/2000 and I was quite excited to learn that a new Thief game was being made.\n\nTo put you into perspective, I was so happy that it got announced and confirmed that a new Thief game was being made and best of all, developed by the talented Eidos Montreal who made that great gem which is Deus Ex: Human Revolution, a prequel game set before the events of the older Deus Ex games. It was all raved and I did too, loved that game very much. They didn't messed up the story, continuity of the previous older Deus Ex classics. Eidos Montreal earned my deepest respects with that masterpiece! Sure, that game may not be better than the first Deus Ex, but it was the second best of that franchise.\n\nThen, came the announce of "THI4F". At that time, not much was revealed but it was hinted to be a sequel to Thief: Deadly Shadows (Thief 3) so at that time, no big deal, I was quite excited! And then, silence... for a long time... until news arisen that the game was being, made into a "pseudo reinvention", not totally a reboot nor a remake; and especially not a sequel. "Pseudo" as this Thief game doesn't explain Garrett's origins and starts the game with him as being the super master thief around... Like it is a game that occurs in a different universe than the Thief Classics.\n\nNow, I got worried... especially with the E3 2013 showing (lots of AI issues shown live)\n\nMonths later, I was beginning to be very concerned for this game. Why discarding the previous work of the franchise? Thief is a niche franchise and the fans holds dearly the past games! And once some scraps of info got revealed time to time, my concerns were completely justified. Bad news after bad news (QTE, Stephen Russell replaced, etc), I was getting so letdown by this new Thief game. I tried to be hopefull and even dared to PreOrder the game, to show my support to EM but alas, they really disappointed me badly with this product.\n\nThis Thief is not a mediocre game, it can be fun at times and many missions are reminescent to Thief 2 style. But for the true Thief fans from the original classic games, you will be VERY VERY dissappointed. This game doesn't really have the same ambiance of the classics. Benny's and taffer pals are gone, meaning no more humor between the guards. Citizens wandering around the city do not acknowledge you or even see you; giving them a robotic feel. The story is totally the biggest con of this Thief. It did everything to forget and distance itself from everything related to Thief Classics. In this new Thief, no more magic, supernatural elements are gone, THE CITY ain't steampunk anymore! And, what happened to the Hammers? The Pagans? Keepers? Trickster? Viktoria? What about Mechanist robots, Pagan creatures, Keepers, Gods? GONE!!! All discarded! Worse, your mechanist eye has different story and ain't even "mechanist" anymore but some bullcrap like "Primal", which explains the use of FOCUS function in the game; that highlights your surroundings / loots / traps to ease of your gameplay.\n\nA big annoyance in this game (it is also present in many other games and I'm very annoyed by it) is the many contextual applied for this game. You have to watch Garrett steal and interact with everything as opposed to just taking things like the Thief classics. Why a problem? Well, it slows you down for crying out loud! I haven't really dabbled with the combat in this Thief since this game is all about being stealthy and not a tank warrior! From what I tried in the Master difficulty level, you die in two hits... so you better be good at dodging! Still, I'd say this combat system is more realistic and modern. The game offers 8 Chapters and about 30 side missions. There is also a challenge mode that you play a map of your choice, then try to accomplish a set count of challenges. It can be fun for a while but since the game only offer three maps now, it'll get stale fast!\n\nNow, I will go with the pros and then, the long list of cons.\n\nPROS:\n+Stealth ambiance/atmosphere is there and mostly well done.\n+Graphically/visuals impressive.\n+Fun missions and many side missions.\n+Custom options on your gameplay. Can disable HUD, Focus, etc. Lots of possible customizations!\n+Upgrade system is kinda neat but also, weirdly implemented as your supposed to be THEE Master Thief!\n+Swooping mechanic is neat and quite a blast to perform.\n+Refined combat system compared to past Thief classics.\n+Asylum level is tense, creepy at times too but short of being as scary as Thief 3: Deadly Shadows' Shalebridge Cradle level.\n+Bank Heist DLC is very reminiscent of Thief 2 Bank mission. Highly recommended!\n\nCONS:\n-NO BENNY! NO TAFFERS!\n-Stephen Russell, aka the voice actor of many characters on previous Thief games (Garrett, Benny, Karras, etc), was replaced by Romano Orzari; "a disconnect" the developers said but it was the developers who were disconnected from the true Thief genre. Full body motion technology was barely witnessed in-game so it was really a cheap excuse to dispose of Russell's that easily.\n-A few stuttering issues, bugs and unstable at release. Mostly fixed by now though.\n-Everything ignored on past Thief games except "Garrett, The City, Basso and Jenivere" names in this game.\n-Old factions gone! No Hammerites, Mechanists, Pagans, Trickster.\n-Mechanist Eye is gone and replaced by some "Primal" crap, which explains the FOCUS function if you enable/use it.\n-Sandbox navigation system is bad in this game. You easily get lost and try to find the proper path for a side mission or main mission. There's many loading too in this game... way too many.\n-Abysmal story. Lazy poor a$$ narrative writing.\n-Way too many contextual situations. Like being forced to do the developer's desired action.\n-Boring and uninspired NPCs.\n-No Eric Brosius soundtrack composer. This Thief Luc St-Pierre composer ain't bad but no Brosius.\n-You cannot jump at will, you cannot use your rope-arrows on any wooden surface but only the developers specified areas. Your "choke-arrow" (known as Gas Arrow on Thief classics) only "choke" the targets and do not render sleep.\n-Buggy AI\n-Sound propagation is messy and at many times, you either don't hear footsteps or door opening/closing. Also, there's sound clipping and repeated sentences.\n-Forced boss fight. Sure you can run and escape but it is so tedious that doing the fight is just less of a hassle.\n-Limited replay value.\n-STILL NO BENNY!\n\nOVERALL:\nThief is an okay stealth game but as a THIEF-based game, very bad. Lots of bad decisions during development. The developers kept telling about "a disconnect" between fans and them, well duh! You, Eidos Montreal, made many bad calls for this game and it shows. And actually, EM simply should have used another name and make their own stealth game instead of screwing the great masterpieces of the past. Why didn't they just created a new character instead of messing up Garrett? A big irritant is why oh why did they just ignored the fans feedback for their game? Fans knew what was correct and what wasn't, yet, EM gave the fans the middle finger!\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nHonestly, the worst Thief game. If you loved the Thief classics, you won't love this one. You may enjoy parts of it like I did but still, you'll be very disappointed in this iteration of Thief. My best advice... either play the GOOD OLD Thief classics or if you seek a modern game, play Dishonored! Granted Dishonored is more action-oriented but you can choose to play as a ghost as well. As for this "THIEF", wait for a sale!\n\nEidos Montreal, you are big TAFFERS for screwing up this franchise!\n\nRATING:\nAs a Stealth game: 6.0 / 10\nAs a Thief game: 5.0 / 10\n\nFINAL:\n5.5 / 10\n\nPS: That river must really stink in The City... every NPC keeps talking about it!","March 13, 2014","false","44.8"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","8"

It's the most linear stealth game I have ever played. There's only ever one efficient way on how to complete areas and get past guards. Another terrible thing about this game is that dreadful and disgraceful dash ability you get. The developers clearly didn't care about the level design so they slapped in the dash to make things a little easier. The dash makes it more like a cover to cover stealth game than an FPS stealth game. And that dash basically becomes the only way to get past guards in some situations. It's way too much checkpoint to checkpoint. Overall: the stealth in the game feels lazy and implemented in a hurry.

I didn't particuarly enjoy this game.\n\nI was kind of going okay through it up till about Chapter 4, then as the plot shifted in Chapter 5 I just lost all interest, by the end of Chapter 6 I gave up trying to collect all the loot and documents in the chapter, and the cinematic railroad ending to Chp 6 was more annoying than interesting. I slogged through the remaining 2 Chapters (that ending left me seriously no plussed) and then unistalled it without going back to finish all side missions. I'd done about 18 of them and that was enough. For me, basically, the story was rubbish.\n\nThe stealth mechanic was largely well done, chunks of the game had a nice set of alternative routes and allowed you to sneak as you wanted. Combat I basically avoided, and did just reload when I alerted too many enemies.\n\nThe video segments seem to run at a horribly low framerate compared to the game. Steam was claiming it was running at 60fps during the videos but they looked more like 24-30fps; horribly stuttery (even running from SSD).\n\nMusic and atmosphere were well done, though something was wacky with the speech. At times it was buried too far to hear clearly even when you were looking at the two people talking to each other.\n\nThe game generally ran at a solid 60fps on my rig (i7 4790k, GTX 970, 16GB Ram, Win 10), though there were times when the fire effects (in the area just before you start Chp 7) and other atmospheric effects which were making the framerate tank.\n\nLittle things that bugged me, the loot you steal throughout the game, the narrow passage ways that you shimmy through and ALWAYS have to lift a beam by mashing the E key, that if you start to open a window you can't back out, you have to open it and go through by mashing the E key, the fact that the NPC soldiers skins changed each time you reloaded a save, sometimes terribly blind AI and so on.","May 24","false","36.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I had hoped - following on from the decent work done on the latest Deus Ex and Tomb Raider - that Squenix would be properly placed to do Thief some justice, even if it failed to meet my lofty requirements.\n\nAnd, if you don't know the Thief series, and have little exposure to any kind of stealth-style games, then you might actually enjoy this title more than I am. For me, its plagued with crashes, out-of-sync audio, and mediocre-at-best stealth gameplay.\n\nMy primary gripe, and one of the things I'm struggling with not boycotting it for, is the lack of Stephen Russell's voice as the excellent Garrett - a choice made for the purposes of full-body motion capture; and a point that is entirely moot since the words spoken are out of sync with the lip movements anyway. Such a shame. Perhaps I am just unlucky in my PCs spec though...\n\nI was going to play through before writing any kind of review, but the fact is, I can't. The game crashes at a certain point and I cannot progress.\n\nBeing sneaky still carries a certain satisfaction, but rather than a true 'Thief' game, this feels a lot more like a cut-rate Dishonored, and I LIKED Dishonored.\n\nGive it a go by all means, but you'll be better placed playing the first two installments (and the third, if only for one of the levels - if you've played it, yes, I mean THAT one), and you'll same some money in the process!","March 2, 2014","false","4.4"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","1"

Especially applies when you're creating a new title in one of the most beloved and creative storytelling franchises in videogaming history.\n\nIt's tragic, so very tragic, that they focused on the wrong thing. The graphics are great. The stealthing around is pretty good. But these are incidental. These aren't what made the Thief games so incredibly, stomach-knottingly, deliciously, terrifyingly immersive. Even now, playing The Dark Project, you can look past the now-somewhat-awful graphics - because the story and the world-building is so damn good, and sinister, and sometimes absolutely petrifying.\n\nYou had one job, Eidos Montreal. Instead, you base the game a century after all the others and largely threw that world away - but then brought in all the familiar names, and....oh, I can't go on, it's like trying to criticize the plotting of an Uwe Boll film. Nothing makes much sense. That's unforgiveable.\n\nDon't be fooled by those lovely graphics, Thiefers. Their allure won't last for long, and then you'll be wincing at a tone-deaf, cack-handed, Dan-Browned travesty of a game series you love. The story is tripe. The way it's told seems badly translated, but not in that lovably insane JRPG way you'll happily put up with for foreign titles. It's rendered in English by people with no apparent flair for dialogue, no sense of plotting continuity, no eye for the little details that bring digital worlds alive - including expansive arenas you can sneak around - everything's cramped in a way that upsets gameplay - and if that's because the graphics were too good to handle big arenas, well, scale back on the graphical detail. Dishonored managed just fine, guys. We'd be fine with less pretty as long as it all worked.\n\nThis was horribly disappointing - and avoidable. In trying to reinvent everything (weirdly, pointlessly), it looks like they threw out 95% of what worked. The previous 3 games laid the world out in detail, with plenty of themes to continue to explore. This game's script should have been a no-brainer. Instead, this game is hollow, bland and painfully clumsy - the Star Wars prequel film of stealth games.\n\nVerdict: would willingly ram lockpicks into my own eyes instead of playing this again.","December 5, 2015","false","1.5"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","16","25","0","1"

But this isn't something that connects to the old ones.\n\nHere are the game's pros/cons as I experience them (each explained later on). Note though that I've only played the main game and have not gotten around to downloading The Bank Heist yet.\nPros:\n-looks good\n-a lot of gameplay (if you choose to complete every side quest and get every achievement, also making this a con for me)\n\nCons:\n-not much gameplay for people who don't want every side quest and achievement\n-short story (ridiculous, too)\n-relatively small and linear maps, lots of points of no return\n-bad sound mechanics\n-bad fighting mechanics\n-bad enemy AI\n-a lot of stuff you don't learn until you either try every key in every possible situation or hope that the loading screen tips give you actual tips\n-no challenge unless you force yourself with achievements and side quests\n\nThe pros here definitely don't outweigh the cons, at least for me. Now, to analyze;\n\nBeginning with the story, it's short and pretty much meaningless -- the background and city are basically the same as Dishonored, some girl absorbs some magic from some ritual, ♥♥♥♥ goes down and from there on, you're partially Batman, there to save the world from the evil and gloom but only so because the game forces you, while your other parts of the brain are trying to piece together what the floop is happening. Spoiler; you never find out. You're expected to just "roll with it."\nYou steal something for one guy, steal something else for another guy (boiling the gameplay down to that of the first AC game or even less) and after that you sneak around some (if you want to) and the game ends. The characters aren't any better than the story is; there's a damsel in distress, the power-hungry villain (who only appears to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good guy), the villain that really isn't one yet everyone wants you to think he is and the villain that appears every once in a while to hurt/chase you. There's also Basso who, for some reason, I like the most. Perhaps it was the slight sense of comedy and irony you got from him. I can't forget Garret, but there's not much to say about him as he's mostly silent. And when he isn't, he's boring. If I had a choice, I'd play the game as Basso. Sure you couldn't run or climb or do anything but at least he isn't as flooping boring.\n\nThe Focus ability is never really explained (not like anything is, but this is a thing you're supposed to use all the time). Sure, I get to see things in blue and Quake Pro-like FOV, but it's not until the loading screen tips tell me at the end of the game that I find out I can get upgrades for it at the Queen of Beggars. The 3rd person climbing parts are annoying until you realize you can press "X" to go/fall down which would also have been a nice tip. You'd really expect to see a manual...\n\nNow I know I'm the kind of person who doesn't like side quests and achievements much, but this game takes my hate for them to a whole new level, solely because over half the game is hidden in there.\n\nThe maps are small. Add to that the points of no return (PoNRs) and the maps feel even smaller. There is no room for exploration because you don't know where the PoNRs are and after you pass one, there is no going back unless you reload your savegame. And even though there are sometimes more ways than one to get somewhere, it's always the same effect. Speaking of PoNRs, they take a lot from the gameplay because you don't get punished if you just run around alerting everyone and jump into a PoNR. All alarms stop and nobody chases you after you pass them.\nAdding to all that "notactics" nonsense, there's more than meets the eye. You don't have to steal (which is funny because the title of the game is Thief), killing everyone is always an option and being stealthy is near impossible at times (forcing you to bring out the big arrows).\nSpeaking of arrows, fighting needs discussing. You can't melee until you get proper upgrades (and even then you don't get any explanation) and even the biggest arrows in the forehead don't kill aware enemies. That said, you can escape by using other equipment, but that's meaningless since you then either blind yourself as well or make everyone explode, alerting even more guards to your presence.\nOoh, and now we're hit guards; how wonderful, it all just keeps connecting.\nThe enemy AI sucks. They're barely ever aware of you, as if they don't want to see you and are just asking for a hit over their head. The hardest enemies to pass are the weird pale monsters, but even those have an algorithm you can easily predict and swoop around.\n\nSound. Ugh, don't get me started on that. The AIs keep repeating what they've already said, a lot of times they don't even finish the first thing only to somehow be able to speak from their butt to tell me two things at the same time.\nThere's no difference in sound if a guard is walking next to me or if there's 2 walls between us and every time you take a guard down, the sound effects make you think somebody has seen you while you were doing the takedown.\n\nI've saved the worst for last.\nThe game cannot decide what it wants to be. A detective game? Open-world exploration? Assassin's Creed? Free-running? FPS? Horror, perhaps?\nWho knows? But Thief somehow manages to be all that, and it does not succeed. The main reason is because you're supposed to be a guy stealing, not Batman and definitely not the guy from Slender: The Eight Pages. It wants to be more than all this, but fails to deliver in every aspect.

Coupled with annoying boss battles that are ridiculous and or cliche, as well as some scenes just straight up taking a dump on the original franchise e.g. running over a rooftop from a bunch of guards, explosions and chasing dogs. It also ended very suddenly, ambiguously and didn't explain much.When putting all that aside and considering that this is a company that most people won't have heard of as well as this being a Triple A title shows just how ambitious this project is. It's fun, dark has very impressive graphics and it's nice to have a new stealth game that isn't AC or Hitman. I also got very good Gametime (28 hours) out of it which is very refreshing.\n\nOverall I'd give it a solid 7/10 (Definitely recommend buying it in a sale but probably not at its full price)","July 15, 2014","true","28.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

You never have to kill, but I didn't really feel a penelty or a point, to killing or not killing respectivly. I paid way too much at launch for as little fun as I had with it, but if you get it on a deal it's not bad. Aparently though for a reboot of the old series it's a travasty, I wouldn't know I never played them, and despite any roots in older popular stealth games, I would likely say it was average for a stealth game, not even on par with Dishonored. Admitedly Dishonored had actual spells, while this has one spell that lets you do stuff better while it's active, basically you have one buff spell that you have to upgrade a crazy amount to have it be more useful than just tapping the button once in awhile to see where guards are. Over all it's bland not a lot of story, it's kind of a neat story mind you, but it seems to have more far reaching implications than this game alone so it kind of never takes off beyond "Garret, save girl to make amends.", like they intended it to have a sequal at some point about another character that was I assume supposed to be cooler than Garret, which if this is the baseline for cool they intended to set then I hope they try to go leaps and bounds beyond Garret if they make a sequal. I can't say I liked it, but I didn't hate it, kind of like Call of Duty games, if you play them they are pretty fun for a while, but they never really feel satisfying to look back on, like it was all some pointless ride. Also it has an open world, and linear missions that take place in a closed world, like Super Mario 64 did, only instead of jumping in paintings you just open a door and a loading screen happens, then you do the one mission and complete all the side objectives in the closed off area and never need to come back to it ever again, unless you want to farm for money which is kind of pointless beyond the few non lethal upgrades you can get, you never need to explicitly kill anybody if you sneak well enough or quick save like a mad man, but even if you are caught you can outrun most guards and move to places they can't fallow, then they forget they saw you after a while, which is SOP so I'm no complaining really. All in all it didn't wow me enough to warnt the sixty dollars I paid for it, maybe for twenty, but personally I would have only paid five if I'd known I'd not have a minimum of as much fun as I did with Dishonored. And just to be clear in case some one reading thinks I have a hard on for Dishonored, I'd like to point out that few games have been first person stealth focused in the past several years, in fact it's bsically just those two, so comparisons were bound to be made, Dishonored was the assassination simulator where killing had concequence, and Theif was the Sticky Fingered Batman simulator where you could kill anyone if you really really wanted to and not have it bite you in the ♥♥♥.","April 27, 2015","false","21.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","8","10","3","0"

After 25 hours gameplay I still found the city map incredibly dull, tedius and annoying to navigate, and avoiding guards through it an incredible irritation. While the majority of missions 1, 2, 3 and 5 was a pleasure to play, mission 4 felt like a tired venture into every other mysterious asylum in recent gaming history, and failed to produce the labarynithine tension of original Thief, while the last two missions were principally a dull trawl with one mildly interesting and one truly snoresome boss battle. While some of the art was gothic and interesting, much of it was bland, and textures were poorly rendered for close inspection.\n\nThe main problem with Thief, though, was Dishonored, which I completed a few weeks back, and which sadly blows Garrett clean out of the water. Coupled with its graphical, geographical and frequent enough to be annoying physical flaws, Thief unfortunately had a poor overarching plot. The early game is not overly concerned with this, and fun side missions assist in detracting some attention to it, but ultimately and inevitably we're dragged back to it, particularly for the last two missions which are little more than a relentless slog to the stories conclusion, which when we arrive at it, is unfortunately disjointed, flat, tired, predictable and due to some poor pacing of the story throughout the game, uninvolving.\n\nI'm sad to say it, but unless, like me, you're a lover of the original Thief and feel compelled to see what this reboot does with it, and are prepared for some reasonably major disappointment and irritation along the way, interspersed with enough good/ interesting moments to just about keep you going for long enough to see it out, steer clear and play Dishonored instead.","August 18, 2014","false","29.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

These segments are at best terrible and at worst among the most frustrating gaming experiences I've ever had. I can't recommend it unless you get it either free (like I did, thankfully) or for very cheap.\n\nPros:\n\n- The lighting system is quite good. The default brightness settings ruin this completely, so turn it down to 50-75% of the base before playing.\n\n- Guards recognize open doors and containers, which is a nice touch that's often missing from games. The same applies to extinguished lights.\n\n- At the highest difficulty, the levels are often enjoyably challenging to get through undetected.\n\n- The difficulty and UI are amazingly customizable. Every UI element can be toggled, and you can set things like disabling knockouts or focus to increase the difficulty.\n\nCons:\n\n- The last two chapters feature endgame bossfights. Combat isn't required, but even dodging is almost unbearably frustrating when most attacks are fully capable of one-hitting you at full health.\n\n- The QTE segments from early showings of the game are gone, but they still feel out of place. One in particular doesn't warn you when you're back in control and is nearly guaranteed to kill you the first time through.\n\n- Jump and swoop are both tied to the same key. This can't be changed and results in many, many deaths by running off of ledges because the game didn't interpret correctly. The same key is also used to get onto hanging ropes. Since it has other functions, it's unclear if the reason you can't get on a rope is design or more misinterpreted keypresses.\n\n- The environment is only usable when the designers wanted it to be. There's no logic to why certain objects are throwable and others aren't or why you can use rope arrows in one place but not another.\n\nOther:\n\n- The story requires immense suspension of disbelief. The Thief-Taker General shows up at the end of 6 of the 8 chapters, which requires an astronomically unlikely series of conincedences and also for him to be an even better ninja than you are. It's silly more than anything else.\n\n- The silliness carries over to the level design. (Minor spoilers ahead) The 5th chapter involves breaking into a prison, which for some reason has a pipe that spits fire. This pipe is later revealed to be completely empty and to start from a tiny box in the floor of the control room.\n\n(end spoilers)\n\n- The audio glitches that early reviews mentioned are largely gone. I only encounted the infinitely repeating dialogue glitch and the echoing dialogue glitch once each. Performance dips remain an issue.\n\n- I have no idea what happened in the final chapter.\n\n\nThe feeling I get from Thief is that the devs wanted to make an action game a la Uncharted but were assigned a stealth game. They compromised by *mostly* making a stealth game, but sticking in their setpiece and action moments randomly throughout the game without any regard for whether or not they made sense. It could've been a great game with a consistent vision, but as it stands Thief is too disjointed and frustrating to recommend.","July 19, 2014","false","12.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Compared to the original trilogy, some of the design choices are inexcusable. Even if this is a reboot, there are some things that simply should never have been added to a Thief game. I'm talking quicktime events, linear levels (complete with points of no return), boss fights, canned takedowns and various other things. The setting is also grittier in many ways, without the charm of the early games (which I sorely missed here). Even when it isn't compared to the original games, the flaws are still difficult to overlook.\n\nBut on its own merits, Thief isn't too bad a game. It's not exactly groundbreaking, but it's still an enjoyable (albeit flawed) stealth experience. The basic gameplay is acceptable enough, and stealing loot is as fun as ever. Thief even welcomes some interesting ideas to the series; an expanded hub world, side quests (both in the form of jobs from Basso, and self-contained missions from Ector and Vittori), collectible loot items and customizable difficulty settings for those who like a more challenging stealth experience. Fans of the series will also appreciate that there are many nods to the previous games and existing lore, which vary in subtlety and significance.\n\nOverall, if you want a true Thief experience, you're better off going back and playing one of the earlier games, or even giving The Dark Mod a go. If you're happy with a Thief-lite experience (or just a stealth one in general), you could do much worse than Thief. It's a bit of a mixed bag of good and bad design, but with the right mindset can still be enjoyed. I don't want to call it a disposable experience, but you really don't want to expect too much of it.\n\n7 / 10","July 17, 2014","true","89.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

I can say that the look of the environments were pleasing and it looked like Thief, it just didn't feel like Thief. The side character was just weird. If we were able to interact better in the environment and maybe shoot a rope arrow on whatever wood surface we wanted to instead of just "certain" posts or points, then I think it would be better.

The AI is mentally challenged on all difficulties. The hub (city) is segmented into several parts, with a bunch of loading screens to annoy the hell out of you. Traversing the town is, simply put, a pain in the ♥♥♥. There is no way to set custom waypoints, apparantly. Sometimes you have to climb through windows to get to other parts of the town, and I find that really, really annoying. And to replay chapters, you have to find the starting point (which isn't marked on the map). And to make matters even worse, every guard wants your head on a pike as soon as they see you. Which wouldn't be so bad, if I wasn't too busy trying to find the exit/entrance to another part of town, which the developers, once again, did not bother to mark on the map. The NPCs suck, and you cannot interract with them, aside from killing them or stealing their stuff. There are lots of audio issues; the music will drown out dialogue, or the dialogue will be too loud (or quiet).\n\nHowever, I do have to admit that the chapter missions (and some of the side quests) are fun. If it were not for the worst hub world I've ever dealt with and the other annoyances, I would definitely say that it's a great game, even with the AI flaws.","February 28, 2014","false","27.6"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","1"

Started it up today and was utterly disappointed.\nThe optimization is complete crap. The game runs pretty good on my rig, but as soon as a cinematic starts, or I turn my head to the wrong direction I get such fps drops that I can make 5 cups of coffee and a batch of guacamole in the meantime.\nAlso, this doesn't feel like a Thief game. This feels like the developers may have known that the Thief franchise existed, but spent most of their time playing Dishonoured. All the while giving a crap about optimization and gameplay. One of the great things about the Thief games was your freedom to approach situations. You could move in any direction you wanted, exploit small ledges, anything that's short of a 90 degree wall. Even then you had the climbing gloves in Deadly Shadows. Here everything is contextual. You can only progress in directions the game allows you to. And you can no longer jump. This limitation helps breaking immersion even further. Heck, you can't even drop off ledges if the game thinks you shouldn't go there. Seriously, how can a game developer think "Man, we have this successful game series where the player decides their approach and has total freedom in moving about. We should definitely remove the ability to jump and design everything linear."\n\nMy guess is, that was done for all the consoles, but who knows for sure...\n\nAnd what about Pagans and Hammerites? I loved those. They added more dynamic to the game, either being friends or foes, depending on your playstyle. But those were pulled out, to make more room for a dull story that's directly ripped out of Dishonoured's still warm body, instead of coming up with something better and Thief worthy. I'm aware that Thief's storylines wouldn't win a Pulitzer, not by a long shot, but they were much more engaging than this piece of crap.\n\nGraphics are alright, I guess. But in this day and age, what game doesn't have good graphics? So no score for that.\n\nWhile I was playing it, I was constantly thinking "Man, I paid 60 bucks for it, but I'd rather play The Witcher than this horrifyingly optimized monster right now..."\nThat's usually not a good sign for a game.\n\nTo sum it up, neither worth your time nor your money. Stick with the old games.","March 1, 2014","false","30.9"," 30 of 52 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","30","52","0","1"

Loads of one way, parkour action scene with falling buildings and exploding pipes. Fire chasing you. Forced into countless escapes and into the gaze of many guards without any control of it.\n\nThere was more parkour than their was stealing.\n\nToward the end I found even the rare few items, always contained in one of the only 4 basic lootable things, dresser, wardrobe, table, floor. Countless pens, ink wells, coins. Loot variety was shocking limited.\n\nThe story was poorly connected and even at the end was not wrapped up with any good feelings, I just felt confused and wanted to close the game for the 20th time.\n\n"Horror" segments where you trawl your way through a haunted asylum ques the game to start trying to be anmesia. Monsters that 1 shot you and run around corners only to vanish. Jump scares while looking through key holes made me want to get out as soon as possible. Loot in these levels is again lacking, mabye 5 ink wells and countless again... pens litter the desks that all look the same.\n\nCountless puzzle segments where you endlessly spin your mouse to move a staircase or structure only at the end to have your screen spin rapidly 3 or 4 times becuase there is no clear indication of when to stop spinning.\n\nSegments where you are thrown into areras with countless guards, only to have them pat in terrible, thinkless patterns almost as if they were automations. And even on the hardest default difficunty "Master" I found myself able to simply shoot countless guards with a smog arrow and run around and take them down, even if more than 1 was on me at once, as the quicktime event of a takedown PAUSES other guards combat.\n\nOverall a very poor game, trying to JAM "FREE RUNNING", use the term free lightly as there is only 1 path for up to 5 mins + of running at a time, into a stealth game, and does so poorly.\n\nThe story did not leave me urning for me, mainly only wanting to stop following it, at the end you are FORCED into a boss fight, and the only way to avoid it is a lengthy and tedious task of repeating the same basic mechanics youve already done 9000 times, and hope the boss with super hearing dosent turn around and use his attack that will ONE SHOT you even behind a pillar.\n\n\n\nThe city hub is disjointed and annoying, you feel forced to wait over and OVER again for guards to tediously pat, repeat dialoge and move on EVERY TIME you move through it. The city seems lifeless, a couple citizens walking around, saying again... the same things.\n\nSo no, I do not recomend this game, dishonored, the game based around killng, had more stealth than this.\nAvoid at all costs if you are looking for a game about STEALING, and if you're in the mood for quick time parkour GALOUR, pick this title up.\n","March 2, 2014","false","9.9"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Luckily the protagonist whose hesitant of his role during this apocalyptic event has to do the only thing he knows how to do which is rather convenient for a man who was in the wrong place in the wrong time! Better a thief than a baker I always say.\n\nBetween frantically changing through your quiver of 10,000 arrows, zooming between shadows, darting across rooftops, and dealing with inbred watchmen/guards, Thief leaves a lot to be desired. Although the game is as aesthetically appealing as a Victoria's Secret Model, it isn't enough to compensate for it's overused plot, repetitive gameplay actions, and completely pointless quick-time events. The two highlights I can take away from this game is the 10 minute break I took while peering through a peephole in a brothel, and the fact that I gave birth to poo babies in the Asylum mission.","September 9, 2014","false","20.5"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

It's not broken (except for the audio), but it still feels like so much of it was left untouched once a feature was deemed to be in working order. The audio is the only part that feels sloppily done. Poorly synced, horribly queued, and when it works it still sounds bad. Music overtaking conversations, conversations repeating themselves and even overlapping each other. So terribad.\n\nSo does the art of thievery actually satisfy in a game titled Thief? You would hope so, but you would be more disappointed in this failure than any other part of this bleak affair. Garret makes his living by taking the paltry possessions of everyday citizens; in a city where people are heavily taxed and can barely make due, where stealing a loaf of bread is punishable by hanging. But hey, Garret's the good guy because he doesn't like killing. And those paltry possessions? Well you're looking at filling your coffers with scissors, magnifying glasses, the occasional bracelet and so many cups, all for several coins each. That is not fun! Digging through drawer after drawer after drawer is in no way preferable to stealing rare jewels and ancient artifacts (oh, and any rare items you do steal go right into a chest, earning you no coin, because Garret likes to look at pretty things and sell common items). Oh, and if you're worried that while you're breaking into a home you'll alert some guard dog or be caught by the resident while they are grabbing a late night snack, dont' worry - not one house is occupied. Not one. This is a world that has an established strict curfew, and no one is home. In a game called Thief, thieving should not be a chore.\n\nIn fact, if I had to choose a second word to describe Thief it'd be "chore." The gameplay never evolves, it never starts simple and begins to take shape into something unique and engaging. From the second you start to the moment you finish you are doing the same thing over and over and over.\n\nOne of the joys of stealth games is the kill/knockout. Taking down a foe with an instant of an attack after doing your best to elude them or setting yourself up to pounce or trigger a devious trap. There's no feeling of accomplishment here when the AI can be so easily fooled and predicted. Any given guard has one path, and moves from point A to point B, usually lingering at either for about 15 seconds - more than enough time to slip past, steal all their valuables, or put them out of their misery. And yes, I know that it's supposed to be hard for them to see you in the shadows, lurking about, and I accept that. But why is it I could more than easily walk right past a guard, who is brandishing a lit torch, and only get a fraction of a glance from him before he figures it was nothing worth note and continues on to point B.\n\nThe story is just abysmal. It's cobbled together from different ideas the "writers" had that never were fleshed out but all told made for enough chapters that they could call it an early week and get started on a six-day weekend. I can't even bother to go into more detail because just thinking about the narrative bores me to the point of suicidal thoughts and I wont let this game have any more negative impact on my life.","March 2, 2014","false","22.5"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","21","35","0","2"

In the original games, it felt more like you were inventing the soluton yourself by applying the tools in your theiving skillset.  Even though you can turn the hints off that still doesn't change the feeling that there's a single solution hardcoded by the level designer - it just takes the clues away to help find it but in the end you're still following the method intended for you.\n\nThis isn't about the plot, the graphics, or the glitches.  This is about the basic game engine design.  In the older games, Looking Glass studios hooked your thieving abilities directly into the low level behavior of the game's engine.  Whether or not the environment allows you to peek around corners, shoot a rope arrow, or jump, were all the responsibility of the game engine to decide.   If the person designing the level wants to make a jump possible, they have to abide by the rules of the game engine and make the jump the right length to make it possible.  If they want to prevent a rope arrow from working they have to abide by the rules of the game engine and make sure no surfaces are made from shootable materials. In the newer game, however, they took the lazier design of doing that all backward.  They made it the responsibility of the level designer to TELL the game engine where those abilities work and where they don't.  The game engine isn't in control.  The person who wrote the level is.\n\nAnd that means inventing your own solution to the challenge isn't possible anymore because there is no such thing as "the rules of the universe" that you can work with to create your solution.  Every solution that works works because the level designer allowed it to work at that location.\n\nAnd that ruins a lot of the feel of the game for me. Eidos Montreal got the rights to the game's name but ignored the entire design philosophy that made it good, and stole control away from the player.\n\nIt's a shame because using modern computer hardware you could have made a game with the "game engine in charge" design and gotten something a lot cooler than what Looking Glass did with 1999's limitations.  But instead they ignored that part of the game design and managed to make a game that was somehow worse despite using modern technology that makes everything prettier.\n\n","May 14, 2014","false","61.5"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","2"

That said, this a pretty sorry excuse for a game regardless if you are familiar with the previous titles or not.\n\nFirst of all, let's start with the awful storyline.  Not only did I find the story completely predictable, it was not even remotely well written or interesting at all.  There really is not much else to say about the story, moving on.\n\nThe number one complaint I have against this game was how little it actually felt like previous thief games.  Sure there is a sneaking mechanic, but the rest of the gameplay completely falls flat when the AI is asked to anything other than move from patrol point to patrol point.  The second you are detected, the horrible AI reveals just how bad it truly is.  Expect to see guards running into walls and unable to show any signs of intelligence in trying to track you down.  When I was detected, the simple act of clambering up onto a dresser or balcony is enough to evade them for good so long as you wait for them to give up.\n\nIf I was not getting annoyed over how easily I was able to sneak wherever I pleased with little to no resistance, I was facepalming my way though all the parkour driven rush sequences which feel completely out of place in this game.  Hey Call of Duty does these types of sequences great, that does not mean I want to see it in a game like Thief Eidos, COMON!\n\nWhen there actually were brief moments in the game when I thought it had a chance to feel like the Thief games of old I love, those moments were quickly erased and forgotten amidst the horrible dialogue, out of place action sequences that you are forced to endure, and laughable AI that was about as challenging as pressing DELETE from my installed games...","May 1, 2014","false","11.1"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

Gameplay is more linear than a second rate side-scroller. The main charcters resemble a couple of sad emo kids with smeared makeup. Game mechanics are laughable. Garret for the most part only does scripted actions. Hit the jump button and he stands there like an idiot. He needs a special key binding to drop off a ledge - with out it he stands there like there's some kind of invisible wall.  Want to shoot an arrow ? Just zoom in and dinky little marrkers will show your way, line themseleves up and you hit fire. Forget about compensating for arc, distance or wind. We have a ♥♥♥♥ing bow and arrow with magical sights. Stuck in front of a window or by some crates / objects you would normally pick up or find a creative way around ? Just mash a key and iniate a brainless scripted scene. That's right just walk along and mash keys. I'm waiting for the tablet or smart phone version where we just swipe garret through the game.

Also city of whiners "My neck aches", "My back hurts", "I feel so tired lately", "I need sloop", "I need coffee". So not even the citizens are in any way likeable. People in one house seem to discuss a thieving job over and over and others talk about that shut down bakery. Over. And over. As if they have nothing more interesting to say.\n\nMechanics are bad.

Why not use the same button as you use the same weapon?\n\nThe missions and client jobs often feel like replaying a bad remix of old, beloved missions of the previous games.\nWinks to old gods and the Keepers don't feel like winks, but more like slaps in the face.\n\nThe open world would've been nice if the Map was working.

A variety of arrows, upgrades, & tools to fit your gameplay. The game incentivizes stealth/avoiding guards due to difficulty of combating multiple enemies with your melee weapon (although you can just run to the exit point on most levels)\n\ncons: lag spikes & horrendous stuttering especially during cut scenes/scripted scenes, stability issues (the game would not even launch at times), QTE in opening windows & moving wooden blocks, some audio goes out of sync, some voice audio varies in volume, map does not tell you which windows or narrow pathways leads to a map transition, map does not allow you to visualize areas you've already explored other than the specific area you are in, there are plenty of side quests - but they do not differ at all (always sent to "take this thing from that person"), scripted parts with instant death scenarios especially on the last 2 chapters, movement/controls can be clunky at times, once you knock out a guard you are unable to grab his loot without being forced to carry his body first, sometimes guard patrols bug out, boss battles are horrendous & the ending was a disappointment\n\nOverall, a poorly optimized game with unbearable lag spikes & stuttering. Even the beefiest of gaming rigs have reported this issue. There are a handful of "solutions" on the internet but the ones I have tried did not solve the problem entirely (turning on the "exclusive fullscreen" on the display menu only slightly improved the lag spikes but not by much), I had to turn graphic settings to a minimum to even get the game running above 40fps. 12+ hours of gameplay but the quality of your experience may vary.

Hammerites, Pagan's and Keepers are all conspicously absent from the story, replacing them with a "Baron" that we're supposed to be concerned about.\nYou can see a few places where they swapped out previous factions and story, and replaced them with generic story elements. I can't understand the decision to keep the main character and his associate, yet distance the game from every other part of the established Thief Lore.\n\nOne positive I have is that the new voice actor for Garrett (Romano Orzari) is pretty good, and almost allows you to forget that they decided not to bring back Stephen Russell. Almost.\n\nI'm a long time fan of the original series, and I purchased this with an excitment I've not had for any other game announced in the past eight years. I was ready to overlook a lot of issues just to sneak around with Garrett in the modern era.\nAfter playing about halfway through, I realized that I had no motivation to finish the game; neither for the gameplay, nor the story completion.\n\nMy reccomendation: Play Dishonored instead.","March 28, 2015","false","18.0"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/recommended/239160/","gosedre","Gosedre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/","215 products in account","Well, in general this is an awesome game. You can actually feel that the developers put in tonnes of effort to give you the old, dark and corrupted slum of city. I have not played any of the previous Thief title but this game gives me enough freedom to play and approach each quest. Thief is basically a semi open city game where you have to try to avoid being detected while achieving your goals.\n\nThe graphics is awesome specially when you maxed out your settings. However there is a serious performance issue after playing a while. There is a benchmark feature in the game and with maxed out setting I can get 50-60fps. The game is smooth for a while and after a mission or so it begins to lag terrible as if the game is trying to reload the texture for the location. The only work around I can find is to set graphics to the lowest possible. Even running on low texture will cause the lag issue. The background music only plays during encounters or certain event and you can only hear sound effects the other times which is excellent.\n\nThe story mission brings you to different locations and settings. Each mission feels really unique. The side quest are basically, well, item retrieving but there is a short story to accompany it. There aren't many side quests but in my opinion it is just right. As you progress, you will be able to purchase enhancement item, upgrade your equiptment and even skills. The game offers a selection of ammunitions that gives you more options to play the game. After each story mission, you are able to freely roam in the city completing side quests or simply finding loot. This process can be time consuming but it does give you a really great sense of completion as your collectibles loot are show cased in your hideout.\n\nApart from the performance issue, there are a couple more things that can be frustrating. The game allows quick save and load. But I do notice each time you reload, the enemies behaviour are reset. Example the guards are suppose patrol in certain pattern but instead they are teleport to a certain location and stationed there. There is also this particular guard in the city when you reload a quick save nearby, he will spin in a 'fasionable' manner while stationed. It is really difficult to approach him then because he will spot you (spinning 360). The city is divided into 2 region. Within each region the map is again divided into 2-3 areas. Now crossing between these areas will not cause the guards to respawn but moving across region will cause the guards respawn. This is extremely annoying and time consuming because you might need to travel between these area several time to complete side quests. And to travel between these areas, you might need to find the exit/entry point which could be an apartment, roof, blockage or door and there are no markers in the map and might be a little frustrating since you haven't memorize the entire map.\n\nNow looking pass through all those set backs, Thief is a really great game and if you are a fan of first person stealth genre, you can give this game a chance.","March 11","true","23.0"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

Get into the manor, get the stone, and get out. There wasn't supposed to be a ritual. She wasn't supposed to die. It's been a year since then, not that Garrett would know of course; he's been unconscious all this time. Things have changed, and not for the better. There's a plague going around; the Gloom they call it. The City's been quarantined, death fills the air, and the watch is worse than ever. There's risk all around, but reward is always nearby as well. Besides; since when has a little danger gotten in the way of a master thief's paycheck?\n\nGAMEPLAY\nAs per usual for stealth games, you must stick to the shadows at all costs. Running is a good way to get yourself caught, as is walking, so you'd be wise to be crouched at most times. When sneaking, you have three states of being. (I guess that's what I'll call them.) You can either be highly visible, in the light, barely visible, in the shadows, or hidden, in complete darkness. To better help you move from shadow to shadow, there is a mechanic known as the swoop. This will allow you to move quickly for a short time whilst crouched and is essential to stay out of sight. You have your two main tools, the blackjack and the compound bow. The blackjack is a simple club like weapon which can be used for combat, breaking levers, and creating distractions. The compound bow allows you to fire an array of arrow types to help during your missions. The arrows available range from the lethal to highly dependable. You also have the ability to lockpick and pickpocket. (I'd hope those don't need an explanation.)\n\nABILITIES\nYour major ability in Thief is known as Focus. Focus will allow you to do a variety of activities with higher efficiency. Loot items, NPCs, and various other things will be highlighted blue. With the help of upgrades you can be lead to unique loot easily, slow down time, conserve your vision meter for effectively, silence your footsteps, and many other improvements.  Something to note, many people are very averse to this ability. It CAN be disabled when beginning your game by choosing custom for difficulty.\n\nVISUALS\nThe game doesn't look too bad. The texture quality is very decent at the least; many of them look good even from a short distance. The game has great cloth physics; due to the engine used. Lip-syncing is good as well; dodgy is some parts but fine overall. The atmosphere of the city is probably one of the best parts of the game. It expertly conveys the image of a plague-ridden society. The game runs at a solid framerate as well. I can't remember exactly, but I believe it ran at about 58 to 61 fps. The main menu has a benchmark feature to test the framerate.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nI wanted to like this game. I wanted to enjoy it so badly. It looked like the kind of game I wanted; the stealing of Sly Cooper mixed with a cohesive stealth system? Great, seven dollars during a sale is a steal! (Pun intended.) The game gave me what I wanted but had forgotten just one thing, charm. Garrett is a boring, cynical, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at most times when I know they were trying to make him sound like a loveable smartass. The story makes no sense; it's bland, boring, and uninspired. Even by stealth game standards, the game is a chore. Nothing happens, ever. At one point (SPOILERS) a building blows up. Mass hysteria, death, fire, rebellion; none of which had any impact. You're immediately thrown into an elevator, which is followed by some platforming without any guards and minimal danger. It has its moments, but with all its untapped potential; Thief did not leave a lasting impression; not a good one anyway. I wish it wouldn't have gone this way.\n\nIf I'm gonna be honest, I think Carrot is more of a kleptomaniac than a 'master thief'. I've never seen one man take so many ashtrays in my life...","January 26, 2015","false","30.5"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

Game franchises, like everything else, evolve over time; in some ways good, in other ways bad.  Just because it's not like how you remember it doesn't make it a bad game.  Quit your whining.\n\nThat being said, I still can't recommend this game unless it's on sale-- like, for super cheap.  It adds nothing new to stealth gameplay, other than a pretty immersive atmosphere; but even that is cancelled out by this game's bugs and terrible audio.\n\nHow is it that a guard that's 20 yards away from me sounds like he's screaming directly into my ear and yet a guard that's standing right next to me sounds like he's a mile away and whispering?  Simple: the developers don't give a ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAt one point, I was lurking in the shadows, trying to figure out how to reach a hidden collectible that was on a higher platform and I heard the guard down the street repeat the same coversation over and over again with another guard that was down the opposite end of the street as if they were standing right next to each other.  If that's not laughably annoying enough, HE WOULD ALSO INTERRUPT THIS CONVERSATION IN MID SENTENCE WITH THE START OF THE EXACT SAME CONVERSATION!\n\nIf you can't picture what I'm talking about, I'll give y-- If you can't picture what I'm talking about, I'll give you an example.\nIf you can't picture what I'm talking about, I'll give you an example.

If you couldn't figure it out, that wasn't the dialogue, that was a demonstration of how stupid and random it was.  After a half-hour of hearing this crap, I finally threw all stealth out the window, dropped down to the street below, ran up to these idiots (who finally figured out that they weren't alone at this point) and beat them both to death just to get them to shut the ♥♥♥♥ up and stop ruining my gaming experience!\n\nSome of the guards will even get stuck within their normal patrolling pattern and just glitch out trying to walk.  That's right-- THE DEVELOPERS SOMEHOW MESSED UP WALKING!\n\nWhat upsets me is that these problems could easily be fixed with patches/updates, but for some reason, the developers are REFUSING to fix these problems in their updates.

Much of the freedom of the originals is gone, for example rope arrows can only be shot at per-defined by developers spots rather than any wooden surface.  With that freedom much of the emergent behavior and lateral thinking is gone too.  The significance of sound is also reduced - you no longer strain your hearing listening to guards footsteps, you no longer get caught because you accidentally put left headphone into your right ear.  The planning and observation are dismissed in favor  of more action style… you no longer watch the guard patrol route for minutes at a time, keeping count under your breath, looking for that one prefect moment, a tiny window of opportunity to sneak past.\n\nAnd you CAN get through the game by killing everything that moves.\n\nBut… if you stop comparing Thief to original games, you will find solid stealth game, with interesting settings, descent story, pseudo-open world, RPG elements, and plenty of content.

Now, that's actually not bad.  2 stars is bad, 1 star is horrible.  3 stars simply means that it was average, enjoyable, but not so good that I need to go brag for it to everyone I know or replay it ever again.  4 stars is an excellent game with some minor flaws, and 5 stars is a perfect game, of which few are.  But Thief is fun, but its easier to quantify what is wrong with it rather than what is right.\n\nThe graphics are well done and they seem to run well on most systems.  The game is solid, although I did encounter one bug and one game crash.\n\nThe stealth system, I thought was lacking.  It was sorta like the Elder Scrolls Oblivion stealth.  If I crouch walk and stay in the dark no one cane see me.  Yes, there are other obstacles like walking on broken glass makes noise (the city has a serious shortage of janitorial staff, glass is everywhere), but overall the stealth system seems undeveloped.  It occurs to me that the stealth in Watch Dogs was actually more fun, and that's only a small part of that game.\n\nThe scenery is bleak and dull, perhaps that is unavoidable with a stealth game set entirely at night.  The characters are all dull, undeveloped, and uncharacteristic of themselves.  Most bothersome to me is how righteous Garret, the protagonist, is portrayed.  Garret is a hero, saving the city.  The people whom he gives concussions to and sometimes kills are evil greedy pigs – how dare they work for a living, including those damned guards.  Further, there is so little choice about who Garret is that its like you are playing through a boring movie.  The plot is very strange.  In fact, it makes little sense to me even now.  I pulled out my trusty smart phone and headed to Wikipedia as the credits rolled to see if anyone summarized it for me.  No one had, No one!

This game is nowhere near as good as Deus Ex: Human Revolution as this game story is terrible and the stealth elements aren't their. This game is more of a platforming stealing game pretending to be a stealth game. As you can see from my playthrough above is that I played on the hardest setting and yet the guards A.I are still laughable. It was times where I was right in front of them and they couldn't notice me and if they did notice me all I had to do was hide for 3 minutes and they would go back to normal like I was never their in the first place. The story is also terrible and it's not helped with Garrett being one of the most boring videogame protagonists that I have ever played as. His monotone voice and nonchalant attitude does not work well with the narrative. And the worse part is that the game's plot is all over the place and makes no sense.

It is a difficult and often daunting task to replicate and improve a milestone of any genre.\n\nLike the gentrification of your favourite suburb; Thief, as much of a title as it is a testament to the gameplay, has deducted the core values of the franchise and replaced them with shallow marketable features.\n\nAny game focused on the design principles of 'stealth' would do so with intelligent level design, a player directed experience and tools that feel valued to their potential contexts. However I found a substantial lack of engagement in all these areas, both in my experience at home and while playing at a friend's house.\n\nAlthough the game falls short on everything that should be expected of Thief, the nature of a purely market-orientated game gives rise to some impressive features. Features that I did enjoy, were the noise hazards, expanded options to tailor your gameplay experience, and the visuals.\n\nThey did an excellent job exploiting the first person medium; having you direct Garret's hands over containers, paintings and items of interest. This feature could be perceived as redundant, but it gave you some ephemeral agency in your role as a 'thief' and made you feel much more engaged in the action of stealing itself.\n\nHowever this could not save the game for me. On every objective level, the game fails to deliver innovation relevant to it's title, legacy and to this era of gaming.\n\nThe common challanges that drive the appeal of stealth are replaced with linear environments, predictable enemies and uneccesary assistance in beforementioned challenges. Players will feel little agency in their navigation through the world, and any illusion of choice will always be broken from poor combat mechanics and a lackluster sandbox attempt.\n\nThis game would be worth the money for $20, but I feel there are many games out there with half the production size, but infinitely more in gameplay features. For this, my time with Thief was frustrating and in the personal space of my own home I felt uninclined to continue my gameplay experience.\n\n\n\n","October 26, 2015","false","1.8"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","23","39","3","2"

There are plenty of other games out that are far more engaging than Thief. And while I'm not on the "the original Thief games r the BEST!" bandwagon, those games were simply much more fun to play. I still had fun with the new Thief - the game tries hard to be engaging. Stealth is required the minute Garrett steps out of his hideout, interacting with the environment is key to success, and there are multiple ways to accomplish a given task. Sounds good, right?\n\nExcept the actual game-play of Thief - thieving and strategizing - happens the same way too many times for the game to carry my interest through to the end (I did get there eventually on my third attempt). The story could have been engaging, but characters are under-developed (some only appear in cut-scenes), show up for no reason, and are blessed with campy B-movie dialogue. The cutscene at the end of the game, while complete, made me think there might have been more to the story, but it was trimmed or cut. Who knows.\n\nThe mechanics of the game work well, but as before, there's little variation: put out fires to create shadows, throw a bottle to distract guards, and swoop to the objective. What should have been a thrilling exploration of an open world Steampunk city is instead reduced to a grind-fest for loot in a lot of close alleys. Some of the level designs are great - the house with the moving walls was one of my favorites - but the novelty passed quickly once I realized that most loot would be acquired (yet again) by rifling through the desks and closets for pens, ashtrays, golden saucers, scroll holders...\n\nIn a sense, Thief really is Kleptomania Simulator. You scamper around the City, stealing random sh*t. But to me, Thief should be about “the job,” not about stealing random sh*t. There are three kinds of jobs in Thief: Main (story) jobs, client jobs that an NPC will provide, and Basso's side jobs. Story jobs advance the story; yes, there's theft along the way, but even with the massive amount of loot in the Baron's mansion, thieving still feels like an afterthought because there's literally no reason to do it. Client jobs have a minor story of their own, but there are only two clients (each provides three missions). Jobs from Basso are side-quests that give some gold and a notice on screen that it's completed. Even though they're acquired from different sources, they all have a similar feel and execution.\n\nThief has great graphics and fun mechanics - the archery is especially good - but these positives are betrayed by a very average use just about all other game elements. The setting needed to be opened up. The music creates tension without being memorable. Enemies only come in three varieties. The enemies' AI all behaves the same (extremely predictable). And boss battles - what a joke they are! Grab Thief on sale if it interests you, and hope you finish it before your patience is exhausted and you start just killing all the guards so you can loot in peace.\n\nOn challenge mode:\nThere are three maps (one of which is DLC): the Asylum, the Baron's mansion, and the House of Blossoms (all excerpted from the main game). Collect loot before the time runs out. Every time you gather loot, the count-down resets. It's an arcade-y addition that might help refine your thieving technique (there are enemies present), but with only three maps it's little more than a distraction. And if you don't purchase The Forgotten DLC (the Asylum map), there are actually only two maps...\n\nOn the Master Thief edition:\nThe Master Thief edition is b*llsh*t. You get: the Opportunist Booster Pack, a digital comic book, and the digital soundtrack. The Opportunist booster Pack contains items that can be acquired in-game, you just get them at the start. To get the comic book, you have to take the code provided and enter it into an external website. To get the soundtrack, you have to enter the code you receive into a different external website. BUT THE SOUNDTRACK IS NOT COMPLETE. I only received 10 tracks of the soundtrack this way. The full album on Amazon is 20 tracks. A straight-up cheat, plain and simple. Don't get the Master Thief edition.\n\nOn DLC:\nOf the DLC, the Booster packs are not pay-to-win, but they are pay-for-an-advantage. The Bank Heist is fun if short. If feels like a left-over level for content that was cut from the game. It's fun, but the value of the loot is disappointing, and it can be beaten in 30-60 minutes. If Challenge mode is something you enjoyed, the The Forsaken challenge map is worth the price - on sale at 80% off, of course.","September 6, 2015","false","47.0"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","14","22","2","0"

To put it simply, Thief 4 is a fun game with some big issues.\n\nStory - You are Garrett, Master Thief. During the tutorial your friend goes missing and you must rescue her while robbing the city blind. Overall the story's pretty generic so there's not much to talk about. It serves its purpose although the characters are quite bland and unmemorable (the only ones I liked are your fence Basso, and Garrett himself).\n\nGameplay - The gameplay is a mix of stealth, action and stealing. You'll be sent on various missions and have to use your skills to complete them. I liked these missions. There were various ways to get through them, the environments are diverse and Garrett has a lot of tools are his disposal. Arrows in particular are a big focus and can be used to light fires, distract guards and so much more. You can buy these with gold you earn from stealing loot (which includes both regular items and special collectibles) and there's loot EVERYWHERE. It really feels like you're a Master Thief who's robbing the city of everything it owns.\n\nUnfortunately being a thief has its dangers and if you get seen then you're pretty much screwed. Garrett can only take a few hits and dying will send you back to your last save (although you CAN sneak behind guards and knock them out first). This brings me to another negative which is the hub city itself. Things are put VERY far apart and often have several loading screens in the way, which turns city exploration into a huge drag as you have to find the particular gate/window that gets you to the next area. Overall the missions are fun but city exploration is sluggish and can slow down the experience.\n\nGraphics - Here we go... Thief 4 looks great and there's LOTS of graphical options too. However it's horribly optimized and ran poorly on my computer. I did research and it's a common issue so keep that in mind if you get the game.\n\nMusic - Nothing much to say here. Pretty generic but serves its purpose.\n\nDifficulty & Replayability - I played through Thief on Normal and found it pretty easy, that being said there's a great amount of customization with the difficulty and you can tailor the experience to your personal tastes. This increases the replayability but I don't see myself playing through this game again. There are a lot of collectibles if you'd like to though.\n\nFinal Verdict - Thief 4 is a fun game with some big issues. If you can get past the poor optimization, generic story and sluggish exploration then you'll find an enjoyable game. I would recommened it, but only when it goes on sale.","September 26, 2014","true","17.6"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","0"

As a standalone game i could see it working but it is definitely not a good 4th game in the series (More like the Blacksheep of the family)\n\nThe music and sounds are continously at odds with each other, id reccomend muting the Music so you can actually hear whats going on around you, and the Dialogue.... It's just crude and crude and crude and crude... Oh it's also extremely repetitive after the first hour or so hearing different guards talking about the same things.\n\nThe gameplay itself can be pretty exciting if you are new to the Thief franchise but if you are a veteran player it is to linear, forcing you along a set path to your end goal (not what thief is about, impo) The city is less linear although you will find yourself going back and forward along the same routes, again hearing the same dribble from the same npcs over and again.\n\nGraphics wise, cant really argue there. It's got nice crisp scenery and some decent cutscenes (Although for a next gen game i gues it had to be a cut above the rest)\n\nI only bought this on steam recently as they had the Eidos Anthology on offer at £24 down from £160.\nIf you like stealthy games and are a fan of Eidos then for £20 i would reccomend Hitman: Absolution instead, there is a lot more gameplay and it stays true to it's franchise.....\n\nOverall if you have never played the Thief franchise and can get this on offer then i would say go for it. If you are a longtime thief fan i wouldnt reccomend this to continue the "Adventures" of Garrett (Again unless it's on offer)\n\n6/10","March 13","true","3.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Never played the originals and wanted to play this first, to judge it without as much bias. After playing for two or so hours I thought it was alright and not as bad as people made it out to be.\n\nThen, some things started to irritate me. Nitpicks I suppose, but after playing the original for a bit, the issues I had/have compounded. Contextual jumping is my biggest issue, having Garrett decide the best way to grab a ♥♥♥♥ing rope in front of him was to jump off the 3 story ledge he was on, straight into the ground below, killing him. This has happened more times than I can count in the 15 hours I've put in. The pseudo-AssCreed style 3rd Person climbing in certain places just feels like it shouldn't be there, and really is pointless. Every time I try to open a drawer in a desk, the contextual leaning decides I wanted to lean, not open the drawer.\n\nNearly every action you can do is contextual, causing issues as I've stated, and essentially turns everything into a small cutscene or an animation in which you've no control. Knocking out a guard, pickpocketing, even opening ♥♥♥♥ing drawers. It makes everything feel sluggish, even in the rare moments Garrett decides to skip the aftercare when knocking a guard out. What comes to mind is an attempt to mimic Deus Ex: Human Revolution's takedown system, and as much I love that game, that takedown system wasn't good there, or here.\n\nThe story, so far, is best to be ignored. Every supporting character seems to only be there to annoy you, Garrett seems to think he's discount Batman, being about as intelligent as the caped lunatic. I've gotten to the point where I've dropped the pretense of Garrett just being a thief, trying to stealth his way through the wallets and safes of poor saps, and just killing everyone in my path just to get through the game quicker.\n\nThe focus abilities seem to be damn pointless, the upgrade allowing you to see lock mechanisms when picking just makes it even more difficult to pick, as the pins actually fight against you now. The stealth Focus upgrade doesn't appear to do as advertised, that is, keeping you hidden in light for a brief moment. With the standard eye ability, the best thing you can do for yourself is drain the focus meter entirely, and just tap the focus button, as the ability will flash on and off, but highlightable objects will be highlighted for a moment. On the subject of safes, I have found maybe 2 combinations in the entire game, and at least one of them you get no matter what because of story reasons. I have found it to be more prudent to brute force or even flat out looking up the combination, as I'm not going to scour the entire city for some cobbler's damn safe combo, for 20 gold.\n\nThere are a lot of moments this game has where it could be fun, but it seems to be content with spoiling it as much as possible. On a more positive note, I absolutely love the swoop mechanic, and ignoring the focus ability for it, I enjoy the lockpicking as well.\n\nThe only reason I'm still playing is I can't stand not finishing a game, but as soon as I beat it, there is no way I'm touching it again. I suggest you don't bother with this.","March 26","false","15.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I love the Thief franchise and I thank all thos who have created it. But I don't find parts and gears that makes up the world of Theif inside of the game "Theif 4".

I understand that they where outlawed but when does that stop a group of fanatics from meeting in hidden rooms and uner the streets! You should meet them at some point! And the the Pegans?

Standard love interest, check. Standard villain, check. Standard gameplay, check. Standard weapons and gear, check. Nothing in this game really makes it stand out from the crowd. In Thief 2 you had huge sprawling levels you could get lost in with tons of secrets to find if you were observant and clever enough.\nOne thing that I really noticed was that rope arrows in this game only worked at very specific points. If you fired a rope arrow anywhere else it would just be a waste of time and arrows. In Thief 2 you could fire one of those suckers anywhere and climb up even if it led nowhere.

Thief is a very good stealth game on its own but as a reboot, it is a terrible Thief game. What made the original Thief games great was thrown out the window for linear-looking levels, weird A.I and lots of problems and bugs for some Steam users who preordered the game although I was fortunate not to have to deal with it. And don't get me started on the story. There's potential but the execution was bad. And the last third act leading to the ending was a complete disappointment. Without Stephen Russell in the role, Garrett's voice sounds pretty flat most of the time.\n\nHowever, Thief The Reboot FELT like a Thief game and that's where this reboot excels. Stealing here is as fun as it was in the original games, maybe even better. The tension as you're opening a drawer to pocket a bit of loot is there and the glee as you watch your loot count rise brings back memories from the old games. Challenge Mode is brilliant, that's where the replay value for this game is. Its more tense and more exciting than the base game itself. No need to worry about the story or anything, just focus on good ole stealin.\n\nNot a great game but not a terrible game either. Thief 2014 will probably be remembered years from now as a missed opportunity but hopefully, it will ignite an interest for more returns to the Thief universe. But it looks like we'll have to wait some more for a more triumphant return of the Master Thief.","February 27, 2014","true","30.8"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","18","30","0","0"

The developers tried to milk an old franchise by adding elements from successful recent ones (like Assassin's Creed).

The interface feels broken, movement is sluggish, the voice acting is often annoying & sounds noticeably generic. The actor they picked up to voice Garrett sounds like he is from either Brooklyn, New York or possibly the Bronx - I can't tell which. I'm starting to see why this is getting low scores on reviews. The sounds overlap and mute each other out, the music drowns out important dialogue at times. I'm wondering how this can feel broken if they've had so much time since the game was announced? How do you &*@^# something like this up so bad?  When the intro screen popped up I wasn't sure if I was about to play a Batman game or a stealth game.  If they're not going to work with Stephen Russell for the voice acting (I'm thinking it was a greed-based decision) then make a new character in the Thief world rather than have someone new pretend to be the old character and mimic his voice. I just can't imagine Garrett spent some time in New York/New Jersey prior to this next installment where he has somehow picked up an accent. Stephen Russel played a sharp, seasoned, calculating, intelligent thief, the new guy sounds like he could play an Italian hitman in some other game or whip out a tommygun.\n\nI really want to go all out & cuss about this game but I'll  just say one final thing - wait until it's $7.99 - $14.99.

However there are numerous elements that keep it far from ideal wall litmus probably due to a long period of gestation that forced developers to return on the numerous initial ideas leading to the creation of a product which in some respects is simplistic resulting in a bit 'rough. And then of course there is the inexorable confrontation with Dishonored that over and over again, playing Thief, I could not help but notice, from a combat system too rough.

If you for an example want to crouch behind some crates, your game might decide that you want to climb up on them instead. the same button is used for everything.\nNeedless to say, if you want to hide, standing on top of well lit crates is a bad idea.\n\nI could live with that, but then there are annoying bugs aswell. I play the game as a thief not an assassin. There's a bug that requires you to kill people to move on. I hope it's a bug, because you're in a vent. someone passes below you, and you get the option to kill them. if you don't, they move on, and you can't get down from there. Ever.\nThere are more gamebreaking bugs I've found aswell, but i've ranted enough.\n\nI want to love this game, but I can't.","April 13, 2015","false","63.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

To sum it up briefly, the game isn't bad, but it's not good either. Just the typical average game you'll pick for like 5~10 bucks max. The problem is, it's too linear. It's basically a corridor game with stealth element in it. And the thing is, the choices to pass are just not so noticable.\n\nLike any average game today, it "needs" a skill tree. Those skills are worthless. I beat the game with some of them but I could have done it without those. However, the shop is kinda neat. You can buy your arrows there and some new tools to steal collectibles, or upgrade some of your tools. Some of those tools will give you access to new areas, but I suspect them to be just bonuses since I couldn't try them all.\n\nThe AI is mostly dumb, however if you get caught, you better run for it, since it's easier to dodge them all instead of hiding or kill them. Something that bugs me is the navigation between chapters. You'll be in the City and go around to get to the mission or side mission to start it. It's longer than a menu, it's boring and more importantly, the city has huge performences issues, even on a good hardware. The City for me was running like ♥♥♥♥ as if the map was still loading when the missions were running well, and not to mentions some audio desync, frame drops in cutscenes, and other glitchy thing that needed a checkpoint restart.\n\nThe Level Design is uninspired and they recycled some layout or other stuff from mission to mission. The story is meh, the voice acting is below average. The main story feels written so quickly, basically it's you're a thief,  your girl teammate dissapears, go get her. There are some side missions to do, and they sound a little interesting, so there are stuff to come back to in this game. Besides, stealing thing is fun and doing it undected is fun too, but not for 30 bucks.","September 26, 2014","true","8.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Game is too short compared to Thief 1 and 2. This so called reboot is nothing like the Thief I used to know. The atmosphere of the game cant reach the atmosphere of the previous games. Dynamic music when spotted, why??? This isn't a FPS, this is a sneaker dammit!!! It doesn't need dynamic music. The city does not feel like the steampunk city that I used to like so well.\nThe general clothing is too modern, its like we moved from middle age to Victorian times and it does not feel right.\nGarret is too obsessed with a girl, something the lone thief never has done before and it makes him a weak character with too much emotional crap involved.\nThe fact that you cant jump, only when you stand in front of crates designed to be jumped or when you can climb a wall, again designed to be climbed makes the possibilities very slim. Compared to thief 1 and 2 where you could use rope/wine arrows at wood and grates, you can only use rope arrows at certain spots designed to that, again a limitation to your movement. There are too many limitations in this game.\nThe game also features client jobs to be done, but none of these does actually appeals to be interesting enough to divert from the main storyline. The only reason to do these client jobs as to get gold enough for some extremely expensive perks, that aren't really needed anyway.\nAll in all this game feel like a console game addressed to the many FPS gamers out there with no taste for quality and only need some cheap thrills.","April 10, 2014","false","41.9"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

But there are simply too many problems with it. Everytime the game did something good, it was too little and too late into the game. The controls are very awkward and stiff. You can peak around corners which is a very cool mechanic and is actually necessary in order to carefully navigate the hallways. Vertical movement is limited to specific ledges and ropes that you are meant to navigate, and levels are very small and offer only a few different paths to navigate that all end up bringing you to the same place with hardly any advantages one way or the other. You are equiped with a variety of arrow types that can be used to help you move throughout the levels. The water arrows allow you to douse flames from a distance which is helpful for distractions. Rope arrows are useful for accessing hidden locations, but they feel more like they are required in order to collect all the loot rather than it being a fun optional path. Sneaking around is fun, but getting caught is never fun to escape from like other stealth games. You're better off just quickly restarting from your last checkpoint because the combat is terrible and the penalty for getting caught is so frustrating that there's no point in trying to hide. Other stealth games like "Hitman" have fantastic combat that is fun to play out when you end up getting caught.. but thief's combat is just garbage and not worth the waste of 5 minutes before you reload your save. The saving grace of this game's gameplay is the stealth itself, which is good because this is a stealth game after all. You can quickly glide from shadow to shadow and you have to pay very close to attention to many fine details to avoid detection. I especially liked having to walk slowly on broken glass and carefully move around animals to avoid the guards getting suspicious. It's a shame this kind of effort can't be found in any of the other aspects of the game.\n\nThe graphics are bitter sweet. The lighting, shadows, physics, and texture work is fantastic, but the environment itself is just BORING. That thumbnail of the game's coverart... that basically summarizes exactly how the ENTIRE game looks. Misty... blue.. dark... that's it. Just lots of grays, dark blues, black, gray, gray, and more gray. I get that the game's setting calls for rather dull colors, but it just doesn't translate well with a game that has you slowly sneaking around. It's just an incredibly boring game that is just barely kept alive with some decent stealth mechanics.\n\nThe sound is pretty simplistic and badly done. You'll hear the same guards saying the same things from beginning to the end of the game and it's more repetitive than usual. Sometimes the same guard overlaps himself with the same phrases. It really breaks the immersion and gets annoying quickly. The music is a strange modern day adrenaline techno sound that just doesn't seem to fit the games setting at all, and the exact same music plays every time you get caught... but that's it. No other songs in the game, no ambient music, nothing. The city just sounds dead, like the people living there just got bored of it themselves and left.\n\nThe story is just a play and forget typical video game story. No characters are memorable, and the character you play as sounds terrible. He constantly chimes in with corny one-liners that feel so out of place and unnecessary. Garret has a very cocky attitude that just doesn't translate well to the type of person he is. The story calls for him to be emotional, but you just can't take him seriously when he never takes his actions seriously. It's a very confused character and I just learned to ignore him completley after the first few missions.\n\nOne thing that really came out of left field was Chapter 5. Out of nowhere, the entire game changed into something else. I won't say what, but I wish that the entire game had just been Chapter 5 and it would have been a lot more enjoyable. But then, right after that, the game goes back into it's boring rut of locations that all basically look the same.\n\nOverall, the game does what it's meant to do very well. It has great stealth mechanics and has a good length. It's a great game for hardcore stealth fans, but anyone else should avoid this like the plague. It's boring, stale, lifeless, and plenty of other stealth franchises do what this new Thief game does far better.","May 9, 2014","false","24.7"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

Thief (2014) feels like a sequel to Thief: DS, since this game takes place (again) in a somewhat open-world called The City for "The Master Thief" Garrett (the player) to explore + b/c this feels much more modern than the previous game. Also, some references also seem like a continuation to Thief: DS. Just like Thief: DS, there are main missions + side missions for him to take on, as well - which are often excellent, with numerous stealthy ways + directions to choose, in a mission (especially main ones). Also, Garrett can also just explore The City to enter people's houses + shops to rob them!\n\nGarrett meets up with an old friend named Erin, for whom he was a mentor to. She has been greedy, trying to find a certain object, which could make her ultra-powerful + ultra-rich. Erin disappears after an incident + Garrett awakens quite a while later. A disease called The Gloom is spreading + an over-powerful figure has taken The City by storm, imposing his will on this now poverty-stricked + disease-ridden City. This part sounds very similar to another [excellent] stealth game Dishonored (in which that game took a lot of cues from the older Thief games). There is also a resistance building-up against this person, as well - which again, sounds right out of Dishonored's book. Garrett begins taking jobs again to make money + to gain information on Erin's where-abouts.\n\nThere's an interesting dynamic that goes on b/t Garrett + Erin, which I wish was further explored here. Garrett usually knocks people out, steals stuff & moves along. Of course, the player can also play deadly, if they actually feel like it & choose to do so (or not). Meanwhile, Erin's turned into the complete opposite of Garrett - willing to kill to get what she wants, without hesitation. Early on, this stuff is excellent. I do wish this was emphasized + explored a bit more, though.\n\nI do wish certain story elements + characters were explored quite a bit further here + a bit more fleshed-out; & that certain events went a different direction - instead of sometimes taking the predictable or under-developered route. This stuff is seems to be one of the few weaknesses I've seen to find with this game.\n\nEidos Montreal has tried like hell to make this game appeal to both the hardcore, old-school Thief fans + for the modern gamer. Besides your typical difficulty levels that games usually allow the gamer to select, players can impose a Custom Difficulty Mode. Here, the gamer can decide what features they can turn off. A lot of these features that can be disabled (or left enabled) - they are the features modernizing the game. These can range from Disabling One-Hit Takedowns, Game Fails When You Are Seen, Disable Focus Mode, Disabling Shimmering Objects & numerous other things. Personally, on my first run-through - I played on Thief difficulty mode. More games should take this excellent approach of allowing such a deep customization of your difficulty + settings - which flat-out embarrasses most games that basically only have a few difficulty modes.\n\nLike Hitman: Absolution, there is a new X-Ray mode (which is similar to the Batman: Arkham games) called Focus Mode. Garrett can basically see through walls + see enemies. It goes further than that, also. Garrett can even slow-down time, be faster in this mode, do lethal blows & even see important objects be highlighted even more so than normal. A lot of this depends also on your difficulty settings + what skills you upgrade. Depending on what you turn on + off, the game scores the difficulty setting. You're scored in-game, also.\n\nThe more Garrett does in the game-world, the more money he can make so he can buy Equipment from merchants & even can purchase Focus Points from a certain someone. Also, Focus Points can even be found in the game-world. This is how Garrett upgrades his skills. Skills can range from making Garrett faster; see more hidden objects in the game-world (& on the map); make him lockpick faster; be more deadly in Focus Mode; his attacks do more damage; upgrade the amount of equipment he can carry; & numerous other things.\n\nGarrett no longer carries a sword - for his main weapon. Garrett only has his blackjack, which by default can make the game played quite a bit more stealthy (as long as you don't level-up down a more action-orientated approach). Getting into fights (especially early on) is not really the best idea, until you've followed Garrett's skills down a certain path. Garrett has his usual assortment of arrows for his bow: regular arrows to hit enemies with; rope arrows so he can climb ropes + reach certain areas; fire arrows to burn objects + enemies; water arrows to put out fires; explosive arrows - to name a few arrows. Also, Garrett has a claw + can climb certain walls w/ it. While a great majority of the game is in 1st-person perspective for the camera + you're seeing through his eyes, when Garrett is platforming on pipes & rappelling down some objects (like Lara Croft would in the Tomb Raider games or Nilin in Remember Me), the game switches to a 3rd-person perspective.\n\nThief (2014) gets the feel of being "The Master Thief" better than any other game I've seen. Besides the big things the Thief games always got right, there's also now a lot of subtle + little things that are emphasized big-time here. A new cover system has been added, as well - in which Garrett can glance, lean + look around objects. Garrett can switch from cover-to-cover. A bit similar to Blink Mode from Dishonored, Garrett can perform a "Swoop" move that moves him very quickly & hard-to-see for a moment - but, its range is very limited. While here you can't move very far + in that supernatural way like Dishonored allowed with Blink Mode - Garrett's "Swoop" seems like a way to speed-up the gameplay here a bit, making it a bit faster + more action-orientated.\n\nThat's not everything on subtlties, either! When putting his hands around paintings, we see Garrett's hands close-up, moving around to try + find the switch to find hidden objects. The same goes for bookshelves, as well - when Garrett's looking for a book that actually might pull a switch to reveal a hidden area. We see Garrett react to objects he finds in the game-world, that might be worth a lot of money. We see (mostly) from the 1st-person perspective, with Garrett opening drawers to cabinets, dressers & other things - moving quick + fast like a Thief would. Garrett has a home-base, in which he stores all of the important things + trophies that he's found, stolen + taken. Not only that - you can look at your stats in-game + even store equipment there, also.\n\nNixxes has done a good job with making the PC version look technically excellent - which seems like the norm for them, after seeing many of their recent ports for Square Enix + Eidos (Hitman: Absolution, Tomb Raider 2013, Sleeping Dogs, etc). Though, performance was all erratic on DX11 w/ most things on Normal on my PC (i7 950; 1 GB of GF GTX 560 Ti; 8 GB RAM; Win 7 64-bit) on its own - ranging from 40 frames to 60 frames per sec at any moment. Locking it down to a 40 frames maximum with EVGA Precision X certainly solved this issue.\n\nIf you really liked Thief: DS w/ the direction that game took with gameplay + modernizing the series (when it did), then I'm pretty much preaching to the choir here - play Thief 2014; it does this even more so than Thief: DS. If you weren't happy w/ the direction Thief: DS took [especially when compared to the previous 2 Thief games (Thief: The Dark Project / Gold + Thief II: The Metal Age)] - it's still possible the game might be for the old-school Thief fan b/c of its new Custom Difficulty Mode. After 31 hours w/ my 1st playthrough - Thief (2014) was really good, even despite its few flaws that just rob it from reaching greatness.\n\nGrade = B+.","July 6, 2014","true","31.2"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","4"

I had high hopes upon loading this game for the first time given the sheer brilliance of the original games - this was quickly dashed as the linear, closed, languid environment was set before my eyes.  The graphics are nice, yes, but where is the ambiance?  Where is the quirkiness or the eccentricity of the townspeople and guards?  Where is the magic, the factions, the religious zealotry that I grew to love about the believable and engrossing world that encompasses everything about Thief?  Nowhere.  They have now decided that these things should be stripped out in place of a boring, lazy version of the game that simply takes less time and imagination to create.

Unfortunately, there were way too many problems with the game.\n\nFirst, the atmosphere is very spotty: at times the setting looks incredible! It's awesome to crawl around the streets, lurking in the shadows, or sneaking around the inside of some castle. Other times, it just looks ugly and lazily designed. The character designs are putrid; Garrett looks lame to say the least, and Erin... just terrible. I don't know who designed her. The characters were a major turnoff for me.\n\nAs far as the mechanics go, they're smooth and intuitive enough, but there isn't the same level of variety and openness to experimentation with one's toolset as there was in the original games. The stealth was fun, but very shallow and predictable overall. My favorite part of the game was actually just doing the side mission thievery in the sandbox area of the game given to you by Basso, I actually felt more like the original Garrett while doing those. But they're just minor side missions at the end of the day, so there's not much to speak of there, and it doesn't improve the overall game a whole lot.\n\nI bumped into quite a few glitches while playing as well, mostly with the AI. They'd get stuck in their patrol paths, following some crazy loop for eternity, or they'd get stuck in the environment in some way. Sometimes the lighting bugged out on me and I was caught for no reason.\n\nTo top it all off, the ending was also terrible. That "final boss" was completely unnecessary and ruined whatever dramatic buildup the game's story had so far managed to establish, for me at least. I mean the game isn't 0/10 worst ♥♥♥♥ I ever played, but it's just not good — it's somewhere around 5/10 for me.","October 3, 2015","false","27.3"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","0"

Played T1/2/3 and i loved them all. One of best games ever made in my private ranking.\nSo i was pretty xcited when they annouced Thief in 2014.\n\nAnd honestly - this is the worst Thief series game,\nand very avarage sneaking game.\n\nFirst bigest disappointment - they replaced Stephen Russell as voice actor. His voice acting was what made thief so unique.\n\nNext thing - they decided to abandon typical for thief series cutscenes. WHY?! I loved them, they were very climatic. Maybe it's  just stupid little thing, dunno. But try imagining next fallout game without its well known intro (war, war never changes).\n\nAs for game difficulty, devs did absolutely great work making this game one of easiest i played lately. Not even close to original Thief.\n\n1. No loud floors (and moss arrows), somethies shards of glass but most of the time its not a problem to run whole level! yes, press shift and run, if too close to guars - you will get sound notification.\n2. New 'swoop' feature allows to exploit almost every guard, in any possible situation.  Absolutely no need of using water arrows now, just swoop and dim lights with you fingers.\n3. Level design - IMO too linear and too simple. Small amount of non-guard npcs make levels even poorer.\n4. Almost every guard i considered that might be an issue was scripted so when i approached he moved somwhere else for few seconds allowing me to quickly swoop behind him.Seriously? Whats next? Patrols that automaticly turn around when they get too close to you?\n5. Focus - another game after Hitman and Tomb Raider that has this feature implemented. The game is very easy without it so i cant understand whats the logic behind it.\n6. Boring and repetitive city missions. Every single one takes about 1-2 minute to finish and offer no variety.\n7. Client jobs - max 10 minutes to finish, with maybe 2 levels really interesting and original.\n8. Guards are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, they will almost instanly forget anything they saw or heard after few seconds of inspecting.\n\nThe controls:\nMaster thief cannot jump. Joke of the year. He jumps only when he's close to rope or a gap. You get one key and game decides for you whether you want to jump or swoop or climb. This 'feature' is major set back, FPP with no 'maunal' jumping implemented. Like in first Doom games. Next Thief will have one key binded for everything.\n\nOverall: 5 out of 10 in my personal score incudling sentimental factor.\n\nOh BTW, visually this game is really hot, audio is also pretty good, but the game lacks everything else.\n\nThe only good thing about this game is how i really want to play old Thief(s) again.\n\nTo Square EnixŁ You guys made excellent Deus Ex remake.

I can max Skyrim (with mods turned on) on Ultra, Tomb Raider on High and ect. on my computer but I couldn't even MOVE with Thief even on NORMAL settings! Early on in the game I experienced glitches that kept getting worse throughout gameplay. Characters spinning around in a circle, models in the T position, characters stuck when on high alert mode.  There were also some whacked out audio levels.  Music was low, SFX mid and character voices higher but some character voices you would hear off in the distance (like during an angry mob crowd) then suddenly BOOMING VOICE RIGHT THERE of another mob character. Sometimes I couldn't even HEAR Garrett earlier when he talked!\n\nGameplay, w ooow. I enjoyed the mechanics but it was too easy. I was playing on Master mode and everything was just mostly simple. I was expecting better responses from the NPCs but it mostly got a bit harder at the end but that was it.  The monsters too? I was disappointed in them. The final battle? Holy CRAP was I disappointed. That was honestly one of the easiest boss battles I'd ever fought and I was hella disappointed. Hella.  The second to last boss was actually HARDER than the final one.\n\nI really enjoy this franchise. I had a lot of fun sneaking around and thinking of ways of getting around but I was honestly expecting something better /especially/ since Square Enix, although published it, has their name on it and after seeing the trailers, screenshots and demos, I expected something awesome.  Really awesome.  But nah, it just became a rated B game, unfortunately.\n\nI only recommend if you're a fan of Thief and just want to see Garrett again (<3) or are a fan of stealth games. Give it a shot otherwise this is one to just buy on discount.","July 21, 2014","false","30.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Now only being on chapter 2 that wouldn't be too bad but I've read on the forums that the same problem happens in Chapter 6 as well. This is why I don't normally buy games when they first come out. It seems companies are so hell bent on releasing games to get money with no concern whether or not they are playable. You can't tell me that the developers did not know about this issue with beta testing. I had this same problem with Assassins Creed and I didn't play it for a year because I was waiting for them to patch the problem.\n\nUntil this happened I was enjoying playing the game but take that with a grain of salt because that is only about an hour of play time.

I had finished up to the ending of chapter two thinking that aside from some slight glitches the game was overall pretty solid.\n\nThere was this small part of town I had to pass through on my way to the third chapter. I found my way into this back alley section where there was a bit of loot and was on my way back out when I noticed the the AI was now frozen in place instead of following their patrol routes. The issue was that there were now two guards staring at each other blackly, one staring down the alley I was to come from.\n\nAfter several failed attempts to get by them I finally just ran back to the gate that loaded this section of the map, alerting everyone in the process. Upon activation of said door, the game came up with a message that it was saving my game which was a little unusal since there is an autosave function it normally uses. Upon loading of the town map, the game somehow loaded me back into chapter one and saved over my game so I can't even go back to where I had gotten stuck.\n\nMaybe I only but well developed games or something but this is the first time I've run into a glitch like this. I do have a save from chapter two but only from mid chapter and I'm not sure I really even want to bother playing it over again.\n\nI enjoyed the game besides this issue but I'm probably just going to pass seeing as it could just happen again.","July 20, 2014","false","13.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Hiding behind corners, lurking in the shadows, stealing that shiny jewel and waiting for the perfect moment to vanish unseen works and feels great. Your tools (mainly a bow with different arrow types), your abilities and the environment work together sweetly and create a fluid and very enjoyable stealth experience. Also, replay value is high. I often found myself playing levels multiple times - trying out different paths, trying not to take out anybody, trying to complete all challenges and so on. "The city", the location the game is set in, offers a great atmosphere, with many dark alleys, suffering citizens and a sinister, depressive, somewhat steampunk-ish vibe to it. This is underlined by the great lighting effects, which make the graphics in the game really pleasing. The skill and upgrade system is rewarding - everything you steal (besides collector items) is instantly exchanged to money, that you can spend on all kinds of upgrades, tools and skills - which impact the game noticeably, like simple health upgrades or an amulet that deflects arrows.\nI would love to be able to continue the review in such a positive way, but unfortunately the great core gameplay is flawed by many annoyances and let downs.\nFirst and foremost there's the story - it is disappointing, told in mediocre cutscenes and dialogues and leaves a lot to be desired. Now that wouldn't be as much of a deal if it would simply stay in the background and do little more than give you a reason to hop from one (mostly excellent) mission to the next. But the scenario, the setting and the small story bits that are there leave you wanting to know more - and the story fails to deliver to that.\nFurthermore, the enemy AI isn't always up to the challenge - enemies sometimes get stuck in walls or run into invisible ones, see you through objects, or don't spot you at all, although you're right there. Still, this does not occur often enough for the AI to become a dealbreaker; tension is always high. The city, while having a great atmosphere, has little to offer. While main and side quests impress with a great level design, small puzzles and lots of loot, there's pretty much nothing to do in the streets of the city - no collectibles, no "city events" and exploration is restricted by buildings you often can't enter and short loading screens while moving from one city area to another. Additionally, the included action sequences often feel unneccessary and misplaced. All this leaves the impression of a game concept that is slightly unrefined and not fully thought through.\n\nIn the end you are left with a game that suffers from many bad design decisions and a weak story, but the great and rewarding gameplay and the atmosphere manage to outweigh the flaws, making it still pretty fun to play.\nIf you're a fan of stealth games, you should definitely give it a chance.\n\n+    -     gameplay  story    graphics and atmosphere  bad open world implementation    level design and replay value  enemy AI    skill/upgrade system  action sequences\n-> 7/10","February 8, 2015","true","55.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Think Dishonored with a talking protagonist, less combat, and more stealing.\n\nPros:\n++Smooth movement, rarely get hung-up and terrain is well defined.\n++Stealing is fun, as you must be quick and careful to succeed.\n+Interesting levels and enviroment, even if it is stereotypically gloomy.\n+Spooky asylum level would've been right at home in a horror game.\n+Rewards the completion of challenges based on different playstyles, similar to Mark of the Ninja.\n\n\nMixed:\n~Main character lacks depth, he's just a guy who steals stuff with your average merc-style "I like money" mixed with the Batmanish "I'm a lonely nocturnal guy who doesn't have very many friends." Does have some good dialogue, however.\n~A great many similarities to Dishonored, including: special magic vision, an oppressive leader with full authority over the city guard, a disease killing all the citizens, rescuing the girl, a ♥♥♥♥♥house level, and the creepy old blind lady with special powers. Also,  betrayal\n~Game is linear, which seems to make people poop their pants. If the ride is a good one, why complain? That being said, only some deviation is allowed beyond sidequests.\n\n\nNegative:\n--Story is lame and unimaginative, generic save-the-girl story but with even less story sprinkled in than other games. Magic occult spooky stuff and whatever.\n-Level design can be very confusing sometimes. I got stuck on the stupid staircase puzzle longer than i'd like to admit.\n\nOverall, if you can get it for $15 bucks or less, it's worth it. I'd give it a 7.5.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSilverHammer/recommended/239160/","TheSilverHammer","TheSilverHammer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSilverHammer/","404 products in account","The short review is: This a very "meh" game.  There are not any major flaws, but lots and lots of little ones.  I bought it on sale and most of the time playing it was just killing time.  I actually had to push myself to finish it.\n\nThe longer version:\nThis isn't a theif game.  It make take place in the theif universe, but that is about the only relation to the other theif games.  I am sure this has been said many times in other reviews, so ignoring that, this game in it's own right is quite bland.\n\nLet me put it this way.  I sometimes play Hearthstone when I have some time to kill or I am a bit bored.  I am not really into Harthstone; It is just a game I play once in a while for a few games.    Many times while playing thief, after an hour or so, I was thinking about playing Hearthstone instead of being absorbed into this game.\n\nSome things that annoyed me were:\nThe City:  You have to run around this place to go from mission to mission.  It get quite tedious fast.  At some point I just stopped doing side-missiosn because I just wanted to be done with the game and was so sick of crossing the city over and over.\n\nMost of the upgrades are geared toward combat.  More bow damage, more health, more black-jack damage.  Isn't this a Theif game?  Oh yeah...\n\nThe constant chatter of the guards complaing about the same things no matter where they were.  IE: you are in a lost temple 100s of feet underground and guards are griping about the fact there are no sloop vendors nearby (what is sloop anyway?).  Or that they can smell the river from here. Or whatever random gripe they cycle through billions of times.\n\nThe fact that garret must have a giant santa-clause bag to carry all the gold forks and ashtrays he is picking up.  In other theif game you did have the minor things you picked up, but a lot of it was high quality loot.  Like a gem or work of art.  Here is tuns of "junk".    Even when you do find something cool, it turns out to be a collectable, not something you can sell.  IE In one mission I went though a lot to reover some phat diamond. I was hoping to get a lot of gold, but nope... Its a collectable.  Nope, if you want gold, you better steal more forks or coin purses from bird's nests.\n\nSpeaking of birds, what is the deal with all the caged birds and broken glass everwhere?  That was also just stupid.\n\nOh, at one point the city is burning and all the NPC chatter is just normal stuff.  Nothing about the fact that the place is in flames, but no, how cold a guard is despite the fact he is 10 feet from an inferno...\n\nAnyway...\n\nNormally in stealth games I prefer to take the non-leathal approach.  However, but the end of this game, my contempt for it got so strong I just wanted to murder everyone.\n\nOh and the ending?  Just bad... really, really bad.\n\nAnyway, save your money and buy something else, even if this game is on sale.  I paid $11 and the only thing it satisfied was my curosity about this game.  Could it have really been as bad as everyone says?  It turns out, yes it can.","September 13, 2014","false","25.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I enjoyed parts, however by the second to last chapter I found myself looking forward to completing the game and moving on to a new one.\n\nEventually I did comple the game, and the ending left me confused without any sense of closure.

I find myself going back to them repeatedly over the years, starting from the easiest difficulty my first run when I was a kid, to beating it on expert multiple times. Each game had its own atmosphere, its own story, each fleshed out and gripping while retaining what made Thief, well Thief.\n\nYou feel like Garrett, you feel like a Master Thief knowing that if you screw up and get seen, you're a dead man. That never changed between the games, a constant that grounded each game to eachother "You Are Garrett, Master Thief". Yet each game had a setting an atmosphere all its own, be it the mechanizations of the Woodsy Lord, or the unfeeling metal monstrosities of Father Karras. Even Thief Deadly Shadows, up until this point the weakest in the series, had scenes and levels that pulled me in and wouldn't let go Shalebridge Cradle in particular.\n\nWith all of that I pre-ordered this game,  I could be Garrett again, I could be the Master Thief. I was wrong. This character isn't Garrett. Hes an idiotic wannabe ninja who apparently broke his legs repeatedly, hes clunky, can't jump, and his "parkour" feels even worse than Brinks, his voice actor change is the least of this remakes worries. On top of that is poorly made level design, and game mechanics that were changed specifically to limit your actions and make this game they tout as "Multiple paths, find your own way" feel almost as linear as Call of Duty. One of the finest examples of this limitation is the Rope Arrow, originally you could shoot this into any wooden surface granting great freedom in where you used it and how you used it to get around. Now you can only shoot it into pre-designed  areas littered throughout the area denoted by a wooden board wrapped with rope, limiting your movements to where the developers want you to go.\n\nTo keep this review from going on for even longer, heres my conclusion. This game is uncreative, limiting, and above all lazy. Its like they didn't even try to make this a Thief game. Take this as a recommendation for the original 2 Thief games, and while weaker, the third. If you play those and want another game. Just go play Dishonoured as a full stealth character, its not quite the same but its a lot closer than this abomination.","August 3, 2014","false","7.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I paid $15 for it and my 23 hours of play time was worth that. I plan on finishing out some of the extra side content and that will probably round out the value of the game for me.\n\nDisclaimer: I haven't played the previous (original) Thief games.\n\nALSO MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. I wouldn't consider them spoilers, but if you're a purist I figured I'd warn you.\n\nThis game was a few ups and downs for me. It started off pretty great. I was really enjoying the idea of being a master thief. Sneaking around and being able to find my way into different places on the map. As the game went on though you learn that you obtained special powers; that if you "focus really hard" things become clearer.\n\nThis is were I had my first down. I was expecting this to just become a cop-out over the rest of the game. Giving you god-like abilities (a la Dishonored) in a situation where you seem to be just a normal guy we some practiced thieving abilities (unlike Dishonored which made the powers an integral mechanic of the game). For most of the game these powers, to my delight, did not make you god-like. You are fragile enough (without "massive upgrades") that if you don't at least attempt to stay hidden and sneak around, you WILL be punished. You certainly aren't a damage drinker like you would be in a Call of Duty game. This made for a fun play through with some good challenges in many areas. I must say though that if you're looking for the "choose your own path" approach this is where this game seems to falter again.\nThere are clearly places in the game at which you are funneled into a specific path. Usually at these choke points if you were playing a Ghost playthrough you are going to have a stupidly difficult time trying to pass it, when a Predator, or an Opportunist, will pass it in a matter of seconds. It feels like it's an artificial difficulty spike. If each play-style is apparently weighted the same then don't make areas that are stupidly difficult for just one of them. This of course is just my opinion. Maybe I missed something in the surroundings that could have made it easier, and so my opinions may be unfounded.\n\nThe last up and down came towards the end of the game. I was enjoying how the story was developing and how the levels were becoming longer, demanding a more thought out approach to each level. This all came to a head, though, when you reach the last story mission. Here you end up put in multiple situations in which the game is effectively linear. You have to reach ONE door, or ONE opening, to proceed (if there were more openings I must be blind because I spent forever on that last mission searching places). In a game that sold itself as you being able to choose how you get places this was a kick in the teeth. The last mission, the one where everything is supposed to come together, validate your experience, you're forced into a cookie-cutter, one-size-fits-all experience. It felt like everything I had done for the rest of the game didn't really matter. I lost any choice that I could have and that spoiled the times when I did have choice. It wasn't just the lack of choice that really spoiled the end for me, though.\n\nThe ending of the game is one of the most abrupt and least fulfilling that I've ever encountered. There are no answers to anything you may be wondering throughout the game, it just ends. Well, not before they give you a plot convienience that allows them to market you another game in the future. It seems like they just gave up and sold the game, without spending time to wrap it up. Maybe its just me but it sucked.\n\nAll in all I'd say buy the game, if its on sale.

Compared to the originals, even the 3rd one which doesn't hold a candle to 1 & 2, this is an abortion. This is what happens when you spend 6 years making a game, with frequent changes in the design staff leadership, and attempting to turn a niche game into something with a wider audience based solely on market research. In all honesty, what makes it so bad is comparing it to the originals. If this was just a standalone IP, it might not seem so bad. Not great, but not awful. It'd be about average of the market today, which really isn't something to be proud of. Now of  course people might say "Hey, you can't really compare it to the originals because it's a reboot and it's 2014 and blah blah." But I call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on that. If they didn't want people to compare it to the originals, then they shouldn't have used that IP.\n\nPros:\nGarrett has more weight now. It feels like you're controlling a person, not just a flying camera that can move things.\nThe art design(minus Garrett's design, which is terrible) is pretty good, if monochromatic.\nGraphically, it is pretty.\nThe menu for choosing your difficulty options is pretty sweet.\nCons:\nLiterally everything else.\nThe story seems to have been written by one of my 16 year old cousins when he was high.\nAs does all the dialogue(One character literally says "We're not so different, you and I.").\nSpeaking of dialogue, NPCs will just repeat the one line assigned to them, over and over again.\nSound design if awful. Someone speaking outside in the street will sound like they're right over your shoulder, when you're inside.\nThe music choices are incredibly jarring and do not fit the atmosphere at all.\nLevel design is linear and mostly a rehash of levels from the originals.\nLoading screens out the ♥♥♥. Especially annoying are the ones hidden behind an action(I.E. opening a window or crawling through a tight space). They probably wouldn't seem to bad if they didn't occur roughly every 10 minutes.\nThe contexual jumping mechanic is awful. A game is almost never improved when control is taken away from the player, especially since this is based off a series of games in which freedom of movement was a huge factor.","March 7, 2014","false","35.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Where to start?\n\nLet's start with the good. The graphics are really good and atmospheric and, well...\nThat's about all that's good with this game. The rest is average or terrible.\n\nThe gameplay leaves tons to be desired and I'm not saying that in comparison to the old games but just as a game, it's not very good. I have played all the previous thief games and this one is definetily the worst but if I have to compare, I'd say that it's the most like thief 3 (deadly shadows).\nI say that because the whole game has a hub world so to say and from there you travel around to different levels in the game, just like thief 3. The greatest problem for me with this game is that I don't have the feeling of control that I'm used to. You can't jump and alot of times you feel locked to the enviroment as if you were on rails. Especially in many parts in "the city" which is the hub world. The other problems with the gameplay are numerous.\nQuestionable level desgins, meaningless and lame side quests, lack of freedom with tools but let's talk about the other possible selling point of the game: the story.\n\nIt's bad, with no likeable characters (especially Erin). Erin gets lost early in the game before we get to know her at all. The only thoughts you get before she dissapears is that she's a whining and annoying ♥♥♥♥♥. After that, the game expects you to care for the character since the whole game is basicelly about saving her. So from the start, I disliked the story but it gets worse. The game doesn't know what it wants to be. Supposedly it's a reeboot but many elements are left such as Garrets robot eye and the character Basso yet nothing else in the story connects. It makes up a bunch of questions and plot elements are presented that are never anwsered. A mayor plot point is revelead in one point and then no one ever mentions it again. The story is a joke, a complete mess.\n\nSo what is there left if the gameplay is average at best and the story blows? The anwser is, there is none.\nThe game is simply not worth buying and playing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSilverHammer/recommended/239160/","TheSilverHammer","TheSilverHammer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSilverHammer/","404 products in account","The short review is: This a very "meh" game.  There are not any major flaws, but lots and lots of little ones.  I bought it on sale and most of the time playing it was just killing time.  I actually had to push myself to finish it.\n\nThe longer version:\nThis isn't a theif game.  It make take place in the theif universe, but that is about the only relation to the other theif games.  I am sure this has been said many times in other reviews, so ignoring that, this game in it's own right is quite bland.\n\nLet me put it this way.  I sometimes play Hearthstone when I have some time to kill or I am a bit bored.  I am not really into Harthstone; It is just a game I play once in a while for a few games.    Many times while playing thief, after an hour or so, I was thinking about playing Hearthstone instead of being absorbed into this game.\n\nSome things that annoyed me were:\nThe City:  You have to run around this place to go from mission to mission.  It get quite tedious fast.  At some point I just stopped doing side-missiosn because I just wanted to be done with the game and was so sick of crossing the city over and over.\n\nMost of the upgrades are geared toward combat.  More bow damage, more health, more black-jack damage.  Isn't this a Theif game?  Oh yeah...\n\nThe constant chatter of the guards complaing about the same things no matter where they were.  IE: you are in a lost temple 100s of feet underground and guards are griping about the fact there are no sloop vendors nearby (what is sloop anyway?).  Or that they can smell the river from here. Or whatever random gripe they cycle through billions of times.\n\nThe fact that garret must have a giant santa-clause bag to carry all the gold forks and ashtrays he is picking up.  In other theif game you did have the minor things you picked up, but a lot of it was high quality loot.  Like a gem or work of art.  Here is tuns of "junk".    Even when you do find something cool, it turns out to be a collectable, not something you can sell.  IE In one mission I went though a lot to reover some phat diamond. I was hoping to get a lot of gold, but nope... Its a collectable.  Nope, if you want gold, you better steal more forks or coin purses from bird's nests.\n\nSpeaking of birds, what is the deal with all the caged birds and broken glass everwhere?  That was also just stupid.\n\nOh, at one point the city is burning and all the NPC chatter is just normal stuff.  Nothing about the fact that the place is in flames, but no, how cold a guard is despite the fact he is 10 feet from an inferno...\n\nAnyway...\n\nNormally in stealth games I prefer to take the non-leathal approach.  However, but the end of this game, my contempt for it got so strong I just wanted to murder everyone.\n\nOh and the ending?  Just bad... really, really bad.\n\nAnyway, save your money and buy something else, even if this game is on sale.  I paid $11 and the only thing it satisfied was my curosity about this game.  Could it have really been as bad as everyone says?  It turns out, yes it can.","September 13, 2014","false","25.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

These younger developers haven't learned from the past, believing that QTE's and nice animations make for some fun gameplay. While the world in Thief is quite pretty, Dishonored seems to have really taken the mantle as what constitutes as the new stealth king. Thief lacks a jump button, the designers seem to think that being a master thief AND a free runner, the jump button isn't nessary. The entire world is contextural, you can only do what the small minded designers want you to do. Forget about using the rope arrow to explore the different options of getting into a building, there's only ONE place to use that. While the textures and lighting is nice, the world is too small and cramped, it seems that the City has shrunk.\n\nWhy is it that the modern designers think that every game has to be like Assassin's Creed? or Call of Duty. If I wanted to play an Assassin's Creed game, I would, but these days publishers seem to think that everything should be like that. Lack of real good gameplay makes this seem like a glorified tech demo.\nStay away from this unless you like dumbed down games and watching cutscenes which is basically every younger gamer out there and that makes me sad for the future of games.\nThis reboot should have never happened and I want my money back on this turd.\n\nOk, three hours into this and yes it's still quite simple and no real challenge. Remember that the designers couldn't make a GOOD game due to the console limitations. I still think that this game is not very good.\n\nNow I am 5 hours in, and while the only thing that I really like about this game is the movement, but the lack of a jump button, dedicated lean keys and just bad level design really make this game more suitable to the console player with its simplistic control scheme and general hand-holding, the game will play itself, and solve all the puzzles for you if the designers were allowed to. Hence, this game really lacks any imagination and freedom of movement that the previous games had, including a JUMP button. Thanks, Edios for ♥♥♥♥ing up another franchise.\n\n6 Hours in and while I like the way you move, it has a nice weight and smooth movement the lack of freedom in the levels make this a neutered piece of crap. Why am I still playing? i paid 10 bucks for this turd and I plan on finishing it. The level design so far is quite ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Small areas and lack of choice are what drags this down. I miss being able to stack and move crates, getting stuck on a box, unable to jump OR climb on shows that the designers don't know how to make good gameplay. Console players will feel right at home with this, the game will actually play it self. One long cutscene, this is what "modern" gameplay is, makes me sad :(\n\n12 hours in, and it's not getting any better. The lack of options in the levels make for some very restrictive gameplay. A level under a brothel was uneventful, the brothel itself didn't need the nudity and sex scenes. The amount of cutscenes are two much, obviously the designers don't know how to convey story info through a invisible cutscene. It's very jarring to have control yanked out from under you as a cutscene takes over, making you totally lose the inmersive world that the creators so painstakinly create, bad design choices reek throughout this POS of a game. The contextual gameplay makes for lots of mistakenly closed doors, or dousing of lights when all you really want to do is pick up a stupid piece of gold. The amount of animations for every little thing that Garret does is just to much after awhile, once again the control is yanked away and you lose the inmersivness again.\n\nWhile the visuals in the Brothel and underneath are quite pretty, the size of these levels are too small to really take advantage of Garret and his "swoop" ability, which has no reason to exsist other than to compete with Dishonored, same with the Focus ability. These make a simple game too simple. AI is nothing to get worked up about, it's dead brained and make the stealth kinda useless.\n\n17 hours in, I've been taking my time. What is it with the lack of a persistant world where you leave a side mission and come back and have to do the entire waste of time again? With the limitations of the PC, the first two games had thier issues but they made up for it in large levels and engrossing gameplay. Those games where qutie clever in level design, you really had to think about where you were and where were the guards where in relation to your goal. Their AI routines where persistant and they would hunt you down, in this game all you need to do is lose LOS and your clear. No real challenge or any sense of danger from being caught. I don't think any kid today could ever play the originals and complete them. How could they? with no sense of the past consoler's lose a vital part of what makes simple gameplay so compelling, this goes for the game's designers too. Thief lacks the respect to the originals, throwing on a shiny sheen and gimmicks that have no place in the world.\n\nHaving played alot of PC games since 1995, I found that the further you get away from the triple A titles, the better in terms of originality, fun, and art and design the better. Once in awhile you get a good title, Dishonored, Wolfenstein, Deus Ex, (not HR, lousy boss battles) but these are far and few between. Its innovation that stems from the limitation of the tech that inspires different types of gameplay and level design, Thiefs designers are limited by their lack of being able to see the limits of the consoles and using that as an advantage. Instead adding gimmicks and cheap story telling rather than engaging the player to really take their time and just soak up the world. Focus, and swoop (such a stupid, uninspired name) make Thief qutie boring, they also force the player to rush forward instead of just stopping and take a look. I know a lot of players like this game, but the reasons they like it have no merit. A shiny coat and some flashy effects can't hide the designers lack of imagination. I actually hope that they all get ♥♥♥ cancer. I don't know if I'll be able to bring myself to finish this as I don't know what the story is about.... unrest? plague? characters that are too lazy to fetch their own ♥♥♥♥? I don't know. I really really really want to like this game, I am huge Thief player but I can't get past these crates cause I can't climb on them or jump on them or even pick them up and move them.......\n\nOk, 23 hours in, have I really been playing this for that long? I've been doing the Basso missions, and started on the so-called haunted insane asylum mission and really hate jump scares, their not scary and this level is boring. I thought that there would be a huge asylum to explore, secrets and other goodies to find but no. After the last level with the "giant" safe, I found that the inconsistant art, and almost useless arrow selection really don't make a difference. What can one arrow do that the others can't? nothing except cost more. The impossible architecture don't scale well, what's with the outside being huge and the inside being so small and cramped? Nothing makes sense. When I am in this game, I take my time to remove the guards to make exploring easier. After I leave an area I find that the guards are all now awake and I have to do it all over again, talk about padding up the gameplay. And the amount of loading screens it torture, why oh why can't consoles at least hold the entire level? I mean this ain't 2003 dark shadows era. Triple A gaming, in terms of tech haven't evolved much, You would think that with the power of the machines that this would not be a problem but covering it up with a fancy animation doesn't make it any better.","September 8, 2014","false","41.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I was more than a little disappointed with all the deviations this game makes from the original Thief-series. Already at the main menu, you can hear the music is more like that of an action movie, rather than the fearful noises and tunes found in Thief. The next thing you notice is that they're using a new voice actor, which is really a pity, but as you play you'll find that this new Garett does a real good job in mimicking the original Thief voice. However the language of the previous thief games is gone, replaced with a more modern and American linguistic. Next, the character of the City. The city atmosphere is completely different, more akin to a medieval city with christian chapels, rather than the conflict between hammerites and pagans. The city's secret order seems to be completely gone, replaced by an old blind lady in some ruins - a poor and cliché-like replacement. Finally, the levels. It seems each map is divided into sealed compartments. You only get one chance to loot each compartment, and each compartment can only be progressed from one entry, and left by one exit. What was once open maps, and an open city, is now more or less a straight path on rails (at least that's the feeling I got while playing). Still, for people who can accept some deviation, this game represents a good addition to the stealth game genre. Voice acting is good, cut scenes are well-made, and maps are very well designed. The game looks stunning, and there's definitely some fun to be had, which is why I can actually recommend playing this game.","March 5, 2014","true","12.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Yea uh...no, and its disappointing because a "spectator" point of view from Garret would have been great, but instead you gotta get involved to save your jailbait friend who got caught.\n\nThis game is a conundrum, I read all dev interviews, what they had planned, what they wanted to do, watched it at E3, hell I read about how they developed the bow which is the best part of this game, and somehow this game still falls flat.\n\nThe map and level design also fukken SUCKS. Stonemarket is a maze without the map, there are ledges and walkways that lead to dead ends and nowhere, there's load screens in places you don't want them, using windows to travel between places sounds easy but in reality its a hassle.\n\nLevels are not too complicated at all, often with very simple pathing helped by the fact that the game feels the need to shoehorn you through it with the whole you-cant-come-back-to-this-area, making levels linear.\n\nEdit: I want to add to my review, after giving this game a second shot and retrying it, I found it was just as bad as it was when I put it down.\n\nThere's cripplingly bad lag similar to what I saw with Watch_Dogs which made me question if Eidos can even ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ code or do any QA, there's a bug where windows just don't open no matter how much you mash E after chapter 3.\n\nBut most of all I want to addon how I feel about this game after going a bit more indepth.\n\nIt sucks. The impact isn't there, combat is dull, stealth is dull, the fact you steal crap to buy stuff so you can...steal more is a derp moment, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ QTE for opening windows riles me up, I still continue to question if this game wants to be stealth or action but it's a blend of both and ended up looking like some mutant experiment gone wrong.\n\nThis game feels like Dishonored, if you gutted it, sold the organs on the black market, and used the money to try and make it on a budget, simply put. No soul, little substance.\n\n\nIf you want to get into the Thief series specifically, skip Thief, get the previous entries instead and THEN this one, but on discount.\n\nIf you're interested in stealth games, skip Thief.","October 24, 2015","false","68.5"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","20","35","2","2"

But it could have been much better. Below are the main pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- Great graphics and excellent art direction, with are very effective in giving a oppressive, glooming but beautiful settings. A fortunate detail is that is possible to see almost Garret's entire body, unlike other first-person games.\n\n- Easy, fluid and immersive playability. Though it should have a jump button, I rarely missed it when I was playing.\n\n- Solid stealth options: places to hide, shadows, distractions\n\n- Offers multiple approachs to pass through the levels, as well as lots of exploration.\n\n- Customization of difficulty, with several handicaps to increase substatianlly the challenge.\n\n- Great side-quests, more open-ended than main campaign. I particularly enjoyed a lot the bank heist mission.\n\nCons\n- Story, characters, dialogues: easily (for me) the worst flaws of the game. For starters, it occurs in a completely different timeline from the classic games, many years after their events, so none of the original characters appear here, even Garrett, which here is someone else. The plot is so incomplete, with so many doubts, plot holes and questions unansewerd or dealt incoherently. Examples: the so-called Baron is often mentioned as someone very important for The City and so, but only appers TWICE during the whole game, in short appearances; the Thief-Taker General appears only in incovenient moments and is always misplaced; and Garrett himself is a shadow (pun intended) of his former self; plenty of times he is so sloppy during the campaign that makes arguable the "Master Thief" nickname. And the ending... WTF. So abrupted and frustrating, it's like they had run out of time (or/and ideas) and decided to just end there. If not for the several notes found in the levels to understand the lore it would be much worse. No wonder Rhianna Pratchett (yes, the same from the last Tomb Raider) refused (and still refuses) to talk about the game, except "I hope some of you like it"; well Rhianna, I didn't, so f#¨% you and the other writers. Do not EVER return for a sequel.\n\n- Excess of linearity: Despite what I had said above as a pro, actually the freedom of approach is irregular though the levels. That is there are sections in a chapter which you have plenty of paths and things to explore, but in others the path is strictly linear. E.g.: chapter 4, the mansion section offers plenty of approaches to explore but past that is very linear so the map (which is mostly confusing) becomes unnecessary. Doesn't help either that on screen (and map) there's an icon pointing exaclty where you're supposed to go and how far is it. It kills most of the challenge!\n\n- Music: It is not bad itself, it's ok, but is mostly generic, the kind of could be in any thriller movie. Little of it is remarkable.\n\n- Difficulty: as good as it is to customize it, it feels more like an artificial way to increase the challenge. The AI itself is stupid and predictable, and waht makes frustrating to fight them is that Garrett only has a blackjack to fight them (no knives, daggers or swords!) and have to hit them a few times  to make them flinch so thay can be knocked out.\n\nAs you can see, I detailed more the cons than the pros, so you may think my recommendation is incoherent. I felt that I had to elaborate more the cons to be better understood. But all in all, the gameplay itself is good, the levels are compelling to explore and there's lots of exploration. And at this time of my review the price is really attractive to purchase.\nI have already played the 3 previous games, and I completely understand why many fans hate this game. But I can't deny I mostly enjoyed playing this game (I woudn't have played Thief for almost 50 hours if I didn't, believe me). It is a good game. Although I must admit if I had played them before this reboot I would probably have liked less.\nI honeslty hope there's a sequel and if the development team regards all the feedback, and is more inspired with better writers, future games can be much better than this one.\nI give it 75/100.","September 3, 2014","true","47.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It's very tempting to compare it to the good Thief game, the metal age, but that's just going to make me angry and disappointed. So let me talk about Thief as if I never heard of this franchise before.\n\nI played it on master difficulty and it was hard, but the wrong kind of hard. The detection system is unpredictable, sometimes I can walk behind a guard sometimes I can't, sometimes I can stand in front of a guard in the dark, sometimes I can't. Sometimes the guards arrange themselves into impossible configurations (impossible without being detected) because they have some dialogue scripted that doesn't trigger, because they are stuck on a wall or somethign like that. The level design is generally bad and filled with this kinds of problems.\n\nNow, these levels were made by talented designers, so what  the hell happened? I'm not sure but I have a theory. You see, level design of stealth games is the trickiest thing there is. Take a good working level and rotate one of the guards, now it's an impossible level. It's that finicky. In Thief they created this upgrade system that encompass everything, your equipment, your movements, stealth etc and that's a huge problem for the level designer. This worked on Deus Ex because DX is a game meant to be played in several different ways, so the level design doesn't have to be so tightly locked to a playstyle. You give the player options but you can be sure that it has other solutions. Upgrade system is a bit trendy right now so they blindly included it in Thief and it broke the game.\n\nCity hub. It didn't work in Deadly Shadows, it didn't work here. The reason is very simple, stealth is 75% puzzle-like, there's no fun in solving the same puzzle again, making city hub/open world thing unfun for most of the time. It works on games without puzzle elements, like car games, action shooting etc. It's a bit trendy right now so they blindly included city hub/ open world in Thief and it broke the game.\n\nThe story is all over the place. It's strange, there's a lot of details on the world itself but the story is broken.\n\nYet another mediocre sequel to an excellent and classic game. I have no hopes anymore, Thief will be like Star Wars, where the bad stuff outweights the good stuff. I understand it's not entirely their (the devs) fault. Most of what made the original games special go against the current trends in game design, and it's hard to tell the person that is investing all the money that your game will have none of this open world silliness, upgrade system, RPG elements and all these things that seem to sell games nowadays, and that the graphics will not be up to par with the current generation because we have to compromise something in order to have larger maps. It's not an easy sales pitch and it's a lot of money we're talking about here! But, who knows, maybe Eidos goes crazy and decides to make a worthy sequel despite its risks, or sell the ip to someone who will, whatever comes first.","February 16, 2015","true","19.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Playing through the story missions (eight; nine if you count the prologue) took me about 9 1/2h on normal difficulty whereas I consider myself a solid stealth player. I couldn't really follow the story to be honest, I got a rough idea but the flat enactment and missing depth of the characters led to general disinterest. Which is sad as the atmosphere can get quite tense and the world as a whole is nicely set up.\n\nStealth gameplay works okay, A.I. is bugged sometimes tho. Guards (I've only seen two or three different types during my playthrough btw) should recognize me when I touch them even on normal difficulty, eh? Close combat is rather clunky but handling one or two guards shouldn't pose a problem. Garretts bow is his all-in-one-gear: use it to kill guards, disctract guards, stun guards, blow up guards and also extinguish flames.\n\nYou can buy more or less useful additional equipment from merchants which you can rarely find in The City. Inventory management is a pain though, you can't purchase arrows or healing items directly to the storage in your "residence" and are forced to pay a visit to the merchant every single ♥♥♥♥♥♥ time you need to restock. Incredibly annoying. Thief also offers a completly redundant skill system which has next-to-no impact on gameplay at all.\n\nSpeaking about skill, Nixxes software showed their dedication to create great PC versions of games once more. Thief is very well optimized and ran with a constant 1080p60 on my i5 4570 & HD 7870 with everything except SSAO maxed out. The game can't be considered Crysis 4 or anything but offers great lightning and shadows which is quite essential to such a thiefy game in my opinion. You can really see how consoles held back the game in terms of textures since many of them - including commonly seen as close up like windows and doors - lack detail and could have used a higher resolution. Also, loading times occur too often. They are short still annoying. Whatever, the game looks good and more importantly runs pretty damn well. Also, Mantle and True Audio support are planned for you AMD users out there.\n\nAll in all the game is alright - it lacks a solid story and good characters, but offers a nice stealth gameplay expierence in a very tense setting. I wouldn't pay full price for it (got it through an AMD silver code for about 10€) but feel free to grab it at a prince range from 5-10€ if you can live with the aforementioned problems.","March 3, 2014","true","16.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Not just the effects themselves, which trend generically, but also the mix. It's impossible to echo-locate, everything's so loud. Guards sound like they're next to you when they're not.\n\n* Level Design: the hub world is broken into chunks by fat loading screens disguised by the repetitive jimmying of windows or squeezing past the same propped beam. Actual levels tend to lack the sand-box qualities of earlier titles, tending towards linear play. The game locks you into ridiculous set-pieces encounters at odds with the game's mechanics (a boss fight, timed action set-pieces) that look expensive and play cheaply.\n\n* Narrative: poor. Derivative nonsense, poorly rendered. Performances vary, but tend to be broad in a way that clashes with the self-important tone.

The story itself is poorly written and at times makes no sense, almost as if whole chunks of it have just been left out. I also just didn't *care* about any of the characters or what happened next. Loading times sometimes occur when you wouldn't expect, like going through a window to a room within a level which already incurred a loading time to enter. Audio is poorly implemented with a lot of delays versus what is happening, and especially versus the subtitles on screen.\n\nI did find myself enjoying some of the puzzles, but for each decent puzzle there are a couple of other muddly ones.\n\nOne saving grace perhaps is the look and feel of the environments you explore; this aspect of the game has had plenty of thought put into it and has lots of great detail to discover, but its not enough to make up for the above points and I didn't enjoy the core gameplay enough to really explore.\n\nI kept giving the game a chance to improve which took me to about 8 hours, and since then I have decided to at least try and play it through to completion, but in general I wouldn't recommend the game to others.","July 9, 2014","false","11.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Once you've played Dishonored (where both games stemmed from the original Thief series), you can't say Thief is good. I has all the elements there, but not that engaging gameplay. It has the right tools, the right missions, but it is lacking. I don't have that drive to keep going with the game, it's directionless.\n\nThings I love? I love the stealth element, it's well done, I like a game that doesn't force you to go and engage in battle with enemies if you don't want to - but the stealth element is... I'm just going to overuse the word; lacking. You would expect a Thief to run along the rooftops, to make some simple "video-game" jumps, even some routes you feel would be accessible in real life, are missing. It's very "dash from shadow to shadow" type gameplay. Sure, there are lots of different paths through the shadows, but ultimately, you're just doing the same thing over and over again.\n\nFrom the beginning, I expected to be launched straight into a complex and rich storyline, but I was disappointed. One might argue that Thief avoids a cliche-style storyline, but for me, it just wasn't engaging enough to keep playing. Perhaps I will come back to this game and jump that hurdle, but right now? It just isn't doing it for me.\n\nIf you read any of the professional reviews, I agree completely with them, that's really all you need to know.","July 18, 2014","false","4.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jacobb/recommended/239160/","jacobb","Chandler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jacobb/","1336 products in account","This game is difficult to write a review for. It ranges from brilliant to extremely obnoxious and in the end manages to be a flawed, okay game that really could have been great. It took me about 22 hours with quite a bit of exploring, not killing or knocking anyone out, and doing all of the side missions. If you rushed through the main story it would be MUCH shorter than that.\n\nFirst things first, the actual thieving is great. The missions are, for the most part, well designed, and they have a good variety. Attempting to steal as much loot as possible without being detected really does have its thrills. Swooping in, stealing something while a guard's back is turned, and swooping back to the shadows feels immensely rewarding. The stealth is well done, and there is a variety of tools and upgrades (if you choose to use them) at your disposal. Most of the levels have quite a few different paths you can take. The Bank Heist DLC / preorder bonus is also quite fun, but probably not worth 5 dollars.\n\nMany kudos to the game for the wide variety of difficulty options, graphic options, HUD options, etc. Pretty much every HUD item can be turned off, and you can adjust the difficulty and change various things (knockout/kills not allowed, no focus, no reticle for your bow, expensive resources, etc). There's even an iron man mode (die and it's over). Really, I can't give them enough props for this. Well Done.\n\nOn to the bad. The City, or the 'open world' portion of the game, is tedious at best and absolutely annoying at worst. I feel like this was tacked on due to the popularity of open world games, and in the end it really suffers for it. The game would have been better off without the entire city. It's neat that there is random hidden loot everywhere, but trust me, by the end of the game you'll be really tired of running across the same strange paths, dodging the same guards walking the same paths, and hearing the same dialogue lines. If I have to hear about why that one guard doesn't reek of ♥♥♥♥ anymore... Oh, and if you decide to turn on 'expensive resources', get ready for side missions to be pretty obnoxious to do. Expensive resources makes rope arrows 450g, and you often need one to get to an uninteresting side mission that will net you 50-100g.\n\nSpeaking of guards, the guard AI is, in a world, terrible. I can't hold this against them too much, as stealth games sort of thrive on terrible enemy AI (WHERE DID HE GO? ~5 seconds later~ IT WAS PROBABLY NOTHING), but I think it's worth mentioning.\n\nI didn't experience any crash to desktops or graphical problems, but the game does have a few audio bugs. Sometimes guards would say the same piece of dialogue twice in a row, on top of each other, so you'd hear it twice. Othertimes the audio would go out of sync during a cutscene, or other audio would be playing when it shouldn't have been. There was one mission where I couldn't hear Garrett's voice over the sounds of the game. Again, not serious, but worth noting.\n\nSo overall, would I recommend this? Maybe-- To the right person. If you can slog through the city and the other undesirable parts, there really is some fun to be had. The story isn't fantastic, but the setting is interesting enough and the thieving is fun.\n\nAnd finally, this game really isn't anything like Dishonored. Really, it's not. Corvo is a highly trained magical assassin who specializes in murdering dudes as quickly as possible. Garrett is a thief. He steals things. He says, during the prologue, something like "I don't just kill people." People will want to compare the two because they're both first person stealth games, but they really are not similar games. I cannot stress this enough. Do not expect this to be like Dishonored.","March 11, 2014","true","22.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It's more like a platformer with loading screens and tight hallways with a near useless minimap. It was designed for replay value - you complete a mission, miss 50% of the loot items cause you don't have the gear unlocks yet, and 3 missions later (or 1 cheat engine moment later) you have to go back and loot everything else you missed. And I mean the whole thing is about looting. I mean, yea it's called Thief, but ♥♥♥♥ I can play any MMO on earth and get my fill of looting. This was supposed to be special, atleast that's how I felt coming into it. And I really feel that it didn't deliver. I stopped playing at Chapter 3. Just can't devote my time to it, which is what it's truly hungry for.\n\n\n#MayContainSlightSpoilersAfterThisPoint\n\nThe combinations of arrows are cool, but limited. Water arrows put out open-flames. The two arrows designed to do damage can't pierce the glass on closed-flame lamps, and that just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. I can't even beat it with the mace that I a.) ridiculed another cinematic character for using, and b.) stole and used for myself on the premis that "i can use it better". Which also ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. Just a bad opening scene if you ask me. Cool, sure. But the plot wasn't polished. Maybe end-game gets a crapload beter. But being locked down in the very first city to tiny hallways that lead to predetermined platform-like dead-ends, is just NOT what I thought I was paying for.\n\nSo here's to another game in my library that I'll never play, and can't return for $ or credit cause steam works more on marketing than it does on quality content delivery. And this is the first review I've ever written on Steam, because it's the first (ok 2nd) game I've ever felt was so bad that I had to comment. Perhaps this game is better for someone of a different mindset and bias - but it was not my cup of tea.","September 5, 2014","false","3.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I thought the story and characters were interesting and piqued my interest initially. Furthermore, the city and it's elements caught my attention while I played. It's important to note that the motion capture or animation (not sure which) used in this game did a great job in capturing how people move and I think is very realistic.\nThat all being said, the game left a tremendous amount to be desired. Initially and as I progressed, the story failed to engage me. So his lady-friend is dead, why do I care? He doesn't answer to anyone as he is a thief and nothing more: why is he so selfish? Why are there thieves and no other real criminals? So much of this seems 2-dimensional, so to speak.\nThe gameplay also made me upset. While this "master thief" is very good at stealing and can slink through the shadows with his cool gadgets, climbing abilities, and impressive stealth, why does the combat aspect of this game fail so miserably? He can swipe cups, jewels, letter openers (I'm going off the top of my head) but the sword on the ground in front of you isn't available despite the guard that is clearly about to kill you? There is no easy way to defend yourself?\nThe controls occasionally fail to impress as well. Even remapping key bindings does only so much, especially as it seems like your only option is to run away.\nFurthermore his "powers" and upgrades take a lot to unlock and still only make so much of the game more playable and barely so at that.\nHonestly I think anything out of the Assassin's Creed or Splinter Cell lineup would be better than this.

I play it on high with my GTX 770 graphics card and my i5 quad core processor. Yeah I get good framerates but I feel like it should require a lot less. I remember having trouble running this on medium with my previous 1GB card, and it looks good but, should not be as performance hungry as it is.\n\nThe controlling of the character when playing has a very "blocky" feel, I would say. It feels like the game does everything for you, and there's animations for everything you do that just seems to drag out; opening doors, pickpocketing, locking picking, doing knockouts, and I feel a lot of it doesn't play very good, or atleast on keyboard and mouse.\n\nThe enemy AI are pretty horrible, and make not much sense. If you're standing and walking around in a shadow, even though you'd be harder to see, you could still be obviously visible, but god forbid if you do one little subtle thing like stand on a shard of glass or leave a door open that wasn't open before, they'll notice that of course! Takedowns could've also been promising, but if you try to take someone down and the enemy is less that 40 feet away from you, then they'll hear you, try to fight you, and you'll die, becaaaaaaaaaaaaaauseeee... combat is also terrible! You have the option to strike, and the option to dodge, Both are quite useless, and you'll only really win a fight one on one, but that won't happen of course because everyone will be alerted!\n\nThe features and your equipment could also be promising, but so could everything else in this game. You can have things like arrows you fire that can pull you up on to beams and get you on rooftops, which would've been a nice feature if they gave you more of them to get onto, and if you could actually find the trader that sells all the useful equipment. There is also some other things like water arrows that put out fires, which is alright but, doesn't fix everything else that's wrong with the game.\n\nI find the story very lame, dull, drab, and other words describing generally painfully plain and boring. I'm on chapter 5 currently, and I've found there are 8 chapters, and these chapters are going by rather quickly. I would've thought with less content would mean more quality in that which it has, but apparently not.\n\nOverall I find the game to be a bad rip off of Dishonored some how. It feels a lot like Dishonored in certain ways yet this game is executed so badly I hate to say the words "it's like Dishonored", which is definitely in my top 5 games I've ever played. Of course this game has features of it's own too, and I think I would've liked them, but like I keep saying, this game is just, a huge waste of potential which makes me actually angry that it had to go to waste. I suppose the best one word to describe this game with is; disappointment.","September 9, 2014","false","13.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kloaked/recommended/239160/","kloaked","Kloaked","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kloaked/","104 products in account","I hardly ever write reviews, but here's my two-cents.\n\nWhile the game has an okay graphical style, the gameplay is just so old school. The stealth in this game is far from perfect. It seems like this game wasn't thoroughly tested, or was just neglected to make proper changes. It seems more like an Alpha phase for the game.\n\nStealth:\n\nSo when you're walking around concealed in the shadows, hostiles cannot see you at all unless you're close and in their peripheral vision. What's dumb is sometimes I will knock out a hostile NPC from the shadows and every guard around him will immediately turn into super hostile mode and come straight for me. Three seconds before that I was invisible to everyone. This mechanic is broken as far as I'm concerned.\n\nWhat should happen is if the guards around the guard I'm knocking out somehow notice what's happening, they should not instantly go into super hostile mode and come straight for me for the kill. They should just investigate. It's more connected to what you see in movies. No I don't want exact realism in every single game I play because that wouldn't be fun, but I do want new mechanics. This is 2014, not 2005.\n\nThe Bow:\n\nWhile the bow you have is a great tool, I think the way it works is also broken as far as I'm concerned. Number one, it makes a lot of noise when you're pulling on it. You would think a master thief would have a near-silent bow. If there was a realistic noise mechanic (which sometimes there's an overly dramatic one which I'll get to next) then every guard in the area would be investigating the area because I decided to shoot a rope arrow.\n\nThe rope arrow mechanic is also something super dumb. You cannot shoot the rope arrow just anywhere to climb. No, you have to shoot it at specific spots just like in Tomb Raider for it to do anything. This is such an old mechanic, it's stupid.\n\nI could go on about the bow and how it is poorly implmented but it's not worth any more of my time.\n\nLast but not least, the noise mechanic:\n\nWhile playing the game you will often encounter things in the environment that will cause nearby guards to investigate your position. There's also birds and dogs in cages that will somehow always see you when you swoop (swoop is a near silent movement, by the way), which will also alert the nearby guards of something in your position (you) and cause them to investigate.\n\nOther things you'll encounter are randomly broken glass in the environment that you have to walk slow on or everything around you (even birds and dogs) will be alerted and will investigate your position. Even if you swoop (shadowstep) it will make noise on the glass and will alert nearby hostiles. This mechanic is broken.\n\nThe swoop is not a running mechanic, it's more like a shadow-step mechanic yet it makes noise? This is broken as far as I'm concerned and overlooked by the developers and publishing company.\n\nI could go on, but this game is not worth your time or money.","September 12, 2014","false","19.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","2"

Why does volume on voices increase when people talk of where they hide stuff? Why is my detect-stuff skill maxed out after 30 mins of gametime? Why does loading screen encourage me to listen to conversations that repeat every 4 seconds due to short monologues?\n\nI so wanted to like this title. But hanging at the end of a rope, at BEGINNING OF CHAPTER TWO, unable to drop to the very, very solid ground 2 feet below ... and it kindda feels like Garrett fell victim to what has destroyed almost all titles from my early gaming days: Todays stupid kids have to be able to play it as well, so we put up these safety barriers.\n\nThat, or the worlds steampunked master goth-thief suffers from vertigo and fear of heights. He needs lessons from Captain Kenway, methinks. My screenshot-button went crazy though, so props to designers and a nutsack kick to the engineers.\n\n...

I've found myself actually laughing at quite a few of the conversations I've eavesdropped on. Eavesdropping can also alert the player to potential loot locations. The designers implemented great animations for Garret for when he opens a chest, picks a lock, searches for a hidden switch, or extinguishes a flame further adding to the game immersion. **The plot has been interesting so far** and Thief has wonderful graphics.\n\nNow The Cons:\n\n1. The light meter in Thief is a piece of junk. I can't tell you how many times I would hear my "thief-sense" warning me that someone was about to see me even though I am completely shrouded in darkness. I've dropped bodies into shadowed areas only to have them instantly discovered\nin the patrolling guard's peripheral vision.\nThere were even instances of Garret visually appearing to be\nin shadow but my light meter would say I was totally exposed and vice versa. I extinguished a candle right next to me that didn't seem to give off any light\n\n2. Your dash ability is also crap.\nIt's context based and shares the same command as climb.\nSo my first attempt at being sneaky I inched around a crate, waited for my moment,\nand watched in horror as Garret climbed on top of the crate and into the light rather than dashing.\n\nA similar experience trying to climb a rope I just hung for myself. I had to dance around the AOE of the rope until I found the sweet spot and the game allowed me to climb it.\n\n3. The same can be said for Garret's drop down ability. I swear some ledges require it and some don't. This inconsistency combined with the idiotic descision to not have a ledge hang just adds to the frustration. First I'm forced to climb up a ledge all the way because of the lack of ledge hang. Next I can hear a guard is going to spot me, so naturally I try to back up which would cause me to just fall off the ledge down to the ground below and out of sight. My back hits a wall because of that stupid drop down key and I'm spotted. This was probably from a height of 3 feet and not like up on the cat walks 20+ feet in the air.\n\n4. Guard patrol routes will randomly break. I snuck passed 2 guards while the first was doing his patrol route. Entered a dead end alley and started looting. When I came back he was just standing there and did not resume his behavior no matter how long I waited. Yes I could and did use a bottle, but when you're trying to do the level without raising any suspicions it's frustrating to get to a moment like this when you're forced to break your rule because the game decided to break.\n\n5. I don't understand the purpose of civilians. They completely ignore you so long as you're not killing people, and that's fine. But I've had them investigate thrown bottles, relight braziers, and worst of all report dead or unconcious guards.\n\nThat last one makes zero sense. When you start the game and it is made abundently clear the guards are all corrupt,  vicious, greedy, thugs who bully\nand kill the lesser folk and totally get away with it.\nWhy would one of these poor abused people report a dead guard?\nThey'd be just as likely to get blamed for it and executed.\n\n6. Your map is terrible. All those loot locations you overhear\nare completely worthless because nothing is labelled on the map.\n\nTerrible sound\nYou will hear conversations and have no idea where they're coming from.\nSounds will overlap each other making incomprehensible noise. NPC characters will sometimes repeat the same three lines of dialogue every 15 seconds in a given area.\n\nAt the Siren's Rest Tavern there are two women talking and one of them sounded\nlike she was delivering her lines under water.\n\nThe rewards don't match player investments\n\nIn Thief there are story missions and side missions. Unfortuantely the amount of effort required for you to get from point A to point B is out of sync with the rewards you get once you reach your destination.\n\nWhile on a side mission I found myself doing my usual burglary. Opening chests, drawers, picking safes and it just struck me. I was bored. Painfully, painfully bored. I didn't feel like a "Master Thief" I felt like a kleptomaniac. Picking up ANY item of value to recoup my losses from purchasing equipment. Ink pots? Pens? Letter openers? Who thought this would be fun?\n\nYou buy arrows to gain access to secret areas with more loot, but the amount you get for that loot is such a pitance, you'd be better of just ignoring exploration all together. I spent 50 -75 gold for a rope arrow on Master Thief (don't know the exact amount) only to find a brooch in a bird's nest worth 10G.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nLove the skill and patience that's required to play stealth games.\nThe problem is for a stealth game to be good\nit requires tight controls, consistent game mechanics,\nand inputs that work 100% of the time and that's not Thief.\n\nPick it up on sale for $10 or less, but I wouldn't pay any more than that.\nDon't buy it.\n\n**Update on Plot -- Contains Spoilers **\n\n\n\n\nAaand now I'm in some ruined catacombs and there are\nmole people or some kind of monster? Wtf?\n\nUtilizing cheap scare tactics to try\nand wake me up from the coma that the last 18 hours of gameplay put me in.\nAmazing.","September 17, 2014","false","20.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

After playing Deus Ex: Human Revolution, I thought that maybe I could have the experience re-created in a different universe. Man was I wrong.\nLet's start with the story. The story begins with you and an old-friend roaming a city, looking to steal a prize nearby. However, things go terribly wrong, and an accident happens in which case you wake up a long time later. I think a few months, but I may be wrong as I didn't really care enough to remember. You then try to find your friend, and that's the rest of the game. Trying to find your friend. Yeah, sure, they have the whole thing about the artifact and how you actually need to find that, but your friend is at the center of it all so in essence you really are just there to find her. I will give them props on one thing, though: Some of the characters in this game I really enjoyed spending a moment or two with, especially the villain.\nNow time for some stealth and gameplay reviewing. Guys, if you're looking for a great stealth game, Deus Ex is the place to be. Don't even spend time looking at this game. The A.I. is not the best, the odds are massivley stacked against you on multiple parts, and the gameplay is not exemplary whatsoever. The player view constantly bobs and weaves around, sometimes making you feel nauseas. The mini-games become tedious as there are only two or three. In some sections, you are facing hyper-sensative monsters, and the stealth becomes necessary, but it's a shame that the mechanics of it really let you down.\nLast, the RPG elements. You have multiple things you can upgrade and buy. The two main categories are equipment and skills. However, the skills are all pretty much useless except for the combat ones as they actually make the combat bearable. The equipment becomes fun, however. Buying a wire-cutter tool can lead you through paths you couldn't make it to before. There is also a screwdriver that allows you to go through vents and such. This leads to some interesting new ways to venture through a level, although the story missions are all pretty linear.\nIn conclusion, go for Deus Ex. Skip this game.

Here is the difficult choice. I want to like this game - I really do. "Thief" series are wonderful and a huge name in the history of gaming. But this particular game lets them down - massively.\n\nLet's be honest - it's not a complete failure, but it just seems so... clumsy in everything it tries to achieve. Let's have a look at some key factors, which spoil the gaming experience:\n\n*Repetitiveness - the game is extremely repetitive. Whoever wrote the scripting for guards' spawning, patrol-routes and AI deserves to have his hands broken (so he would not write scripts for some time at least). Every time I switch between the maps or areas, I know EXACTLY when and where the guard or civilian will come out from. Ok - I just loaded into new map and the guard will stroll out of the alley to my right in about 5 seconds... 4... 3... 2... 1... ah - there he is. Every bloody time.\n\nRepetitiveness doesn't stop on that. You have to constantly sneak through the city. And I mean CONSTANTLY. I realise that "thief" is a stealth game. I wouldn't mind (in fact - I would love) to see more side quests, where you have to sneak around new areas, doing new things. But going back and forth through the same streets of the same maps, avoiding the same guards, on same patrol routes and listening to the same dialogues over and over - it's just too much. At first I played the game as it meant to be played - stealthily. Now - I'm just running about, knocking out and killing guards like mad - just to avoid sneaking for next 5 minutes (they respawn) and to make them shut up for a while.\n\n*Open World... not - the game pretends to be a good exploration game with variety of ways to achieve your target. It fails on that. If you look at game mechanics - its just well-disguised "corridor-runner" game. Yes - there are roofs and balconies and all that, BUT - there's usually only one way to reach any particular destination. It is not like "assasin's creed" games, where if you want to access some roof, you have lots of options on how to achieve it - use the ladder, climb the wall, jump from another roof or use some other means to get there. Thief can not do that - it is only one correct way to get there and that is the way you HAVE to use.\n\n*Clumsyness - just about everything feels slow and clumsy. Once again - it is not "assasin's creed" or "tomb raider", where your protagonist feels agile and smooth. No - our beloved thief stumbles across the city like a drunk down a flight of stairs. Everything you do feels like struggle.\n\n*Empty City - apart from annoying guards who go around their poorly scripted patrol routes, several civies who also stroll about the city without any obvious reason and homeless drunks, which serve no purpose at all, the city is empty. Nobody on the roofs, nobody in apartments that you steal from, nobody to talk to, nobody to listen to, nobody with any jobs and side-quests to give you. It just feels like city does not care about you and very soon this feeling becomes mutual - you stop caring about the city and the game as a whole.\n\n*No fast travel - there are so many beautiful games, with gorgeously crafted worlds, where exploring is actually fun. Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout series, Far Cry 3 and so on. Those games make it fun to just walk around the world, yet they all have fast travel option. Going aroun the city in "Thief" is f*****g daunting and it has not got any means of fast travel. That's right - suffer, you b***h.\n\nThat is to name only a few major downfalls. There's plenty more where those came from, but I think you've got the idea.\n\nThere are also a few good points about the game, like dark and gloomy atmosphere, collectable pieces of loot, some interesting (although fairly simple) puzzles along the way, good selection of tools (mainly different arrows, but no real necessity to use them most of the time) and so on. But all these good things are getting hopelesly outplayed by all the downfalls of the game.\n\nVerdict - if you're hardcore fan of thief series, wait for a sale - the BIG one. If not - save your money or buy one of TES games and join thieves guild - much more fun.","December 1, 2014","false","28.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

When it works, it can be enjoyable but it has too many bugs, design flaws and questionable decisions to recommend to anyone but the most desperate of stealth fans."\n\n\n"Thief is a broken, tragic, rewritten mess of a game. ... The Baron and Orion standing in for the Mechanists and Pagans respectively, is fine on paper but it doesn't work in execution."\n\n"The sound-mixing is atrocious. ... Sound cuts out frequently, guards across a courtyard sound like their yelling into the players ear, npcs yell ambient dialogue over Basso repeatedly during cutscenes, and Garrett's voice actor frequently pauses to his read lines. The lip-syncing is horrid. ... Unless you're walking on glass or water, it's doesn't matter where you walk, Garrett won't make a sound."\n\nThere are some really cool additions ... real-world alarms (birds, dogs), the lockpicking game making a noise when you fail. It's quite enjoyable, but not without reservations. Some of the best parts of the game are undermined by, I suspect, poor play testing."\n\n"While the city looks gorgeous, its pretty much empty. The sidequests are neat, but most of the time I'm just exploring an vacant apartment; no one's home. If I mess up the lockpicking or set off a trap 9 times out of 10 it doesn't matter since it's empty. All these cool additions to the game are underused. Also, there's so many loading zones! Enter a one room apartment. Pick up a letter opener and a ring. Leave in under 20 seconds. Load for just as much. This content just slows the game down."\n\nGarrett's movement has a nice heft to it. He feels present. But moving through the world is about working out exactly what the designer wants you to do, not using your instincts or experimenting. If a rope arrow is just out of reach, don't bother trying to grab it. You need to look for a crate, or a ladder or a walk way to reach it. It's a discrete puzzle that was made for that specific instance. ... These guards will patrol in this pattern no matter what. This object can be leaned around, while another identical object cannot. You can climb this crate, but not this one."\n\n"It's such a frustrating game! ... Thief doesn't play like the rest of the series."\n\n"Thief plays like it was made in 18 months. It simply wasn't ready. I hope they get the opportunity to take a long look at what happened here, evaluate and take another stab at the licence."","December 2, 2014","false","24.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

This is something much worse. There's a lot of polish here, but at the end of the day it's just not fun. The Thief mythos has been redefined and the core mechanics have been changed.\n\nDid you enjoy making a pile of bodies on each level in previous Thief games while slowly progressing through? Gone; now the levels are extremely linear and encounters tend to act as a checkpoint through which you'll pass and immediately forget.\n\nEnjoyed collecting loot and meeting those value goals each level? Gone as well. The loot will literally obstruct your path. Levels feel more like a Mario game than Thief--the loot will jump out at you (especially now that it shines *and* you have focus vision to make it pop). Sure you can go slightly out of your way and grab a few more coins, but it's hardly worth it.\n\nDid you enjoy finding secret areas and the rewards within? Also gone. The secrets in this game are designed to be readily found so that everyone can find every secret during every playthrough. Worse still, the rewards inside tend to be unique loot which will go to your hideout to be stacked on each on a shelf or hung on a wall. Absolutely no gameplay rewards here.\n\nDid you enjoy the variety of enemies in the previous games? Gone again. There are two. TWO! types of enemies in the entire game. One of which is just a lazy version of the other, with sensitivity to noise and other triggers turned way up.\n\nDid you enjoy the AI of the previous games? Probably not, I know I didn't. Yet still it's worse here. Enemies rarely alert each other of events. Wandering civilians have been exchanged for caged birds and dogs. Yes, caged. They couldn't be bothered to make the dogs wander, so they just sit in a cage and bark.\n\nDid you enjoy using a variety of arrows to take down enemies? Pretty much gone. There are fewer arrow types, you can hold less of them (especially starting off), and they're extremely rare. Expect to use one or two a level.\n\nDid you enjoy knocking out opponents? Backstabbing them? Stealing arrows from an archer so he can't fight back? Gone. Gone. Gone. You have only a black jack now and there's no distinguishing knockouts from kills.\n\nDid you enjoy collecting keys and progressing through the level? Yup, gone. No keys here, just linear progression triggered by scripted events.\n\nI could go on, but i think you get the point. Is this a good Thief game? Definitely not. Is this a good game when not compared to the rest of the series? I'm afraid not. It does have a couple genuinely enjoyable moments, but those are few and far between, and they certainly don't make the between bits worth playing.\n\nDo yourself favor and skip this game. Fingers crossed that the Thief series doesn't end with this stinker.","December 3, 2014","false","39.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Room-by-room, the gameplay beats feel the same as any past shadow-stealthy-game and I guess there's not much to be done there? The previous Thief games (1 and 2) focused on huge expansive sprawling levels, huge systems with rooms interacting with rooms. Here, each room is so isolated that they might as well be in separate levels. The result is something that feels domesticated and boring. They sacrificed the design scope of past games to meet their framerate targets, forcing you on certain rails so they can maintain tightly controlled levels. Again, the compromise satisfies no one.

But the stealth mechanics aren't that great, the sound is wokny, the game isn't much of a challenge, and it's really linear.\nSome sounds you'd think guards would hear such as footsteps aren't heard, but things you think they wouldn't hear like messing up a lock pick they do hear, and apperently this is even loud enough to wake sleeping guards. Not only this, but occasionly it's impossible to hear people six feet away from you; you can hear the guy who is five feet away clearly, but can't hear a single thing the guy six feet away is. The game is also fairly easy even on the highest difficulty and with all of the help things off. The Parkour also really sucks, each time you go to do a manuver you snap to the object and lose all momentum..It's also rather contextual, and limiting.","December 30, 2015","false","2.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/edge_crusher/recommended/239160/","edge_crusher","Philadelphia Collins","http://steamcommunity.com/id/edge_crusher/","280 products in account","So, another FPS stealth game that relies purely on stealth, with no superpowers or weapons(the weapons are more like tools in this game), sounds right up my alley!  I said count me in.  Oh what a mistake...\n\nFirst off, let's talk about the biggest and arguably dumbest design decision I could think of, the controls.  For starters, you cannot free jump.  Let me reiterate again, you cannot freely jump.  What kind of a ♥♥♥♥ brain at Square Enix thought this was a good idea?  Let's just take one of the basic mechanics of all FPS games and exclude it.  It makes Garret feel and play like an utter gimp.  What kind of a thief can't jump on his own?  So how does he actually get around?  Well, the game dicatates where you can jump.  As in only certain platforms or boxes can be climbed.  Only specified platforms can be crossed or leaped across.  It makes traversing the already clausterphobic levels frustrating beyond belief.  Too many times have I thought I could jump across the roof top only to jump straight down into the street, right in front of a guard and get killed.  Only too many times have I have been cornered, and the obvious route is blocked off by arbritrary obstacles like a pile of boxes or debris that any other game would simply allow myself to climb or jump over, but in this case since the object is not specified, I can't do anything with it.  This doesn't apply to just platforms either.  This also applies to climbing roofs and walls.  You have a tool called the claw, which allows you to climb high walls.  But again, only designated walls which are few and far between.  This also applies to leaning around corners.  A normal game typically used Q and E to lean left and right retrospectively.  But no, this game you have to go up to a corner, and press E and Garrett will grab the corner and peak around.  Why couldn't they just assign different keys?  Too many times have I wanted to grab an object on top of a box or table, press E and wind up peeking around the edge.\n\nMy second biggest problem is the level design.  It's so cramped and maze like.  The open city of the previous entries is gone, replaced with narrow, winding streets cut up into small areas with too many loading areas  that take away any immersion this game had.  There are multiple smaller routes that can be explored, each with different loot than be stolen.  It's routine design when it comes to these type of games to allow replayability.  Some routes require certain tools to be explored.  However, there's no real reward to all the risk to going near guards because of the next biggest issue...\n\nThe combat.  Now, combat has always taken a backseat in the Thief games because it's main emphasis is on stealth and avoiding being seen in the first place.  I wouldn't mind this, but because your jumping and movement is so castrated, combat is almost always inevitable at some point because you either slip up or because not on purpose you jump down instead of jumping across a roof.  You get cornered and can't run away because of arbirtrary game rules.  So running away isn't always an option.  Garret is armed with a bow and a tool called a black jack which is used for striking.  The bow is a typical bow, equips different arrow types and the whole shebang.  However, the black jack is a worthless piece of garbage.  First off,  you press R to swing by default.  Yes, freaking R.  Left click equips your bow and V is for dodge.  So, take yourself throw a scenario where combat is involved.  You have to press V to dodge, and R to strike.  By default, this is extremely awkward, the black jack does minimal damage and your bow is too clumsy to be used in close quarters.  Remember in Dishonored when in combat, parrying and striking with your sword felt smooth and responsive?  Well, take all of that and throw it out the window in this game.\n\nThe AI for the most part is passable for a stealth game, if they get alerted they will search around corners and shine their torches into shadows.  They have their routes and can be distracted with blunt arrows, throwable objects and snuck up behind and knocked out.  It's your typical stealth game AI, nothing too remarkable and nothing too terrible.  However a big flaw I notice is if you are in combat in the middle of the street with a guard, the civilians fail to react in any way shape or form.  They just continue standing in their awkward, repetitive idle stances.  It takes away the immersion, and reminds you again that you are playing a video game.  This doesn't happen 100% of the time, but it happens enough where I had to make note of it.\n\nOn the other hand, the graphics are quite nice.  Especially the lighting effects.  The dreary gloomy feel of the franchise is as present as ever.  Garrett has full awareness, and looking down shows his legs and hands so he feels more than just a floating camera with arms.  On the other hand the animations are stiff, awkward and flat.  Garrett has a little animation for everything including opening draws, grabbing loot, picking locks, turning the dials on a safe, pressing buttons, opening doors and more.  I can appreciate this, as it makes me feel more in the shows of the protagonist.  But, this comes at a draw back.  You cannot quickly rifle threw draws or cabinets, as Garrett has to straighten out, look down and open every single door and draw.  This little times it takes to watch the animations add up, and more than once have I been stuck opening a window or draw and caught by a patrolling guard.  So you really have to make sure the coast is clear before sifting through every draw and dresser in a room.  So trying to be a quick, cunning thief is harder than it has to be.  Unlike Corvo who could pop easily in and out of sight to grab a key, Garrett has to go through an animation which takes away your control for a second.\n\nThe sound on the other hand is busted.  The voice acting is atrocious, with lines awkwardly and poorly delivered.  Dialogue contains many strange pauses in the conversations and combined with lip synching issues, makes cutscenes cringeworthy.  At least cutscenes are rendered in games instead of FMVs though, minus one or two.  NPCs constantly repeat the same few lines over and over, leading to immersion breaking design.Another big issue with the audio is the depth of sound is all sorts of wonky.  For example, if you are standing on the roof top and two guards are talking on the street three stories below, the voices will be loud enough as if they were right next to you.  This is a constant issue I notice throughout the game, and while it's a small quirk, it leads to moments where I would have the volume up and all of a sudden two voices will be blaring through my speakers even though there's no NPCs near me.  However, the audio is not all bad, as sound plays a big factor in being stealthy.  Walk faster, louder footsteps.  The typical stealth sound routine is all in place but to great detail.  Walking across broken glass renders your footsteps very loud, same with walking in water and such.\n\nThe game gets a few things right.  Garretts sprint and swoop moves are very welcomed.  The levels are littered with beautiful little details like hidden rooms, hidden safes, traps and alternate routes, which makes exploring every nook and cranny and must.  Paying attention to surroundings is a must, as broken glass, traps, puddles of water and creaky wood planks are almost everywhere, so speed running is ill advised.\n\nThe game also contains a fair of customization, such as upgrading your abilities and gear.  Also included is a load of gameplay options, like optional warnings, object highlighting, difficulty settings and how much information you want on your HUD.\n\nAll in all, too many clueless design decisions hinder what could have been an enjoyable stealth game.  This is not a thief game at heart, so don't let the name fool you.  2/5 stars, and that's being generous.","May 2, 2014","false","11.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Prime example thats really obvious from the first hour of playing; if I jimmy (break open) a window to nick a house which requires quick-time event button mashing, I should not have to do it again when leaving! Master Thief my ♥♥♥♥! Getting around the city is quite clunky and sluggish in terms of animation; although I do like the immersive first person view (you can see your body when you look down etc) you are given where Garrett physically reaches out into the 3D space and picks up the item. Hard to explain in mere text but you feel truly like you are nicking something rather than "*boop* you've stolen a candle!".\n\nSound aesthetic can vary from well done to "why the hell can I hear conversations being held indoors three blocks away as if they were standing in front of me?" or "Okay, if I hear that 'sloop' conversation one more time I'll bludgeon that guy to death". Voice acting also ranges from good to downright woeful with Garrett somewhere in the middle of that. For some reason certain cutscenes are too low, in others some characters are too loud while others are so feint you can't hear them etc. What a mess.\n\nPerformance wise, the game frequently stutters since the latest patch in order to stream in textures "better". Visual aesthetic is spot on though I'll give them that. Dark and gloomy and infested with vermin; who are not necessarily rats but of mankind too. Plague is rife, beggars line the streets, hangings are amidst and generally this is where you see a lot of effort has been made to make it authentic. What a pity that the gameplay is just lacking in every department.

How it couldn't run on a computer that was above the required graphics card level so all of the textures and graphic and resolution were turned to ♥♥♥♥ mode. There were also many other things that i found strange for a game that i paid about $60 for as in some of the cut scenes at the end had no sound and the judgment at the end of missions was always wrong especially at the end, only one 'thing' died and it was a creature who died by a fire that was pre lit. The first boss encounter was nearly impossible to sneak by but i defeated him by using a stupid method that suprisingly worked, by knocking him out with the gas arrows then pelting him with the explosive ones (He could take more of them than i could, and he took them to the face while i took the flames from it hitting me from the side and even then two of those would kill me). Some of the mechanics were good like the stealth mostly and the looting but if i tried to cancel going through a window i couldn't, i had to finnish going through the window and then go back through.

Not only is the horrible stealth system, a very integral part of the series, atrociously done, the overall game-play is just flat out bad.  After realizing that this game is really a game meant to be played on an ice rink, with it's inexplicable use of press space bar to shadow dodge and win, the game fails to capture any redeeming qualities of the series.\n\nIt is such a waste too since the game itself looks great, how Garret places his hands on walls etc, is very well done and can immerse you in the character, but unfortunately when the large chunk of your game is a stealth game, and that mechanic is incredibly broken, you can only enjoy the little things so long before you give up.  I really wish i had not pre-ordered the game, if this game were under 10$ i'd say it is worth a try, but anything above you're better off with something that will actually be entertaining.\n\nTake the recommendation as you will, but overall a disappointed fan of the game, for someone new to the series it may be a great / fun little game to play around with.

I'm still a big fan of the first three installments. Although these three are quite dated, they are all still one of the best games of the genre and out there. Especially T1 and T2 ate an *insane* amount of hours of my life.\n\nBecause I do like stealth games a lot, I've played DISHONORED this year until T4 dropped to a reasonable price on Steam. Then I started T4 and went from "How it's done" to "What a crap". And now comes a list why I didn't even finish T4 and why I think it's not a good game.\n\n\nThe Good:\n========\n\n- Graphics and presentation. While I never judge a game by its graphics, I did like the great, dark and gritty graphics.\n- The lockpicking and integration for searching hidden switches behind picture frames and book shelves. Well done!\n- The architecture and steampunkish flair. There is absolutely nothing to dislike about mixing magic with torches, swords and machines.\n- Although heard very seldon, the ambient music is beast sometimes (when caught, for example)!\n- While this game is QTE-invested (see next points), the character movement is very vivid. You'll always see Garrett's hands and actions, be it while lockpicking, jumping, walking, crouching, opening a window, looting, grabing a coin or breaking a safe open.\n- The climbing works flawlessly. It's the moments were you have to climb a gutter to get to the roof. This is were the camera changes and you're in third-person-view. I did like this very much, because the climbing is made very fail-proof and easy. Also, the camera *never* gets visually blocked by a wall or something like this. Some other games / developers could really learn from this.\n- The Takedown-QTEs and animations worked every single time and were very satisfying to execute / watch.\n\n\nThe Bad, The Worse and The Ugly:\n===========================\n\n- The acting and enactment in the cutscenes is just plain AWFUL and probably the worst you will ever see in any game. Garrett acts like an idiot. Every time when he's being adressed he acts with an embarressing silence or a dull look on his face, which degrades him to a kind of a mentally reta--ed person who doesn't know what to say. Sometimes you just wish you could punch him in the face. Really hard. With a gauntlet made out of adamantium. They tried to make him like a cool person who has everything under control, but they failed miserably. Therefore, I couldn't identify myself with Garrett and I coulnd't care less about him or his boring story. Or the whole evolving of the story.\n\n- I didn't like the puzzling at all. I'm here to steal, loot and knock people out, not to do some boring puzzling. What am playing as, a Riddler or a Master Thief? I understand many people like puzzling and finding clues, but they should have at least make it as a voluntary thing (for finding secrets) and not mandatory.\n\n- The quick-time-events (QTE) are well done, but overdone. While I do not mind at all having QTE in a game, in THIEF4 you're feeling like you're not playing, but being played. I do leave most of the loot in its place because I'm tired of seeing the same opening-the-drawer-and-taking-random-stuff-QTE over and over again. Maybe I miss the uncomplicated *ring-ring-ring* from T1 and T2 when I'm looting.\n\n- Every loot you find is placed exactly in the middle of a drawer, a cabinet or a chest, as if the City is inhabitated by people with a massive OCD. And in what places people loose their wallet, DEAR GOD LOOK DOWN.\n\n- The QTE define the whole game. Like I said before, you don't feel free at all or in what you do, it's like your constantly on a rail. When you climb a rope you can only be released from it when a platform allows you to and you can only jump when the game allows you to. While this is good sometimes (failjumping not possible), you're getting bored after a few hours, since it feels like you're mum is always with you and helps you with everything and denies you everything else. Meaning you can only jump / climb when the game wants you to, you're very restricted to where you can go. (You can't even fall down a narrow bar or a cliff or a balcony, which is good I guess.)\n\n- "Combat". I completed some levels in Predator mode and killed nearly everyone. I'm fine when I'm firing arrows out of the dark and instantly killing a not-aware-enemy, but in a close fight against a guard is way too easy. It's like it doesn't even matter. Even WHEN it does matter, the combat is horrible. After a few hits your enemy just cowers like unconscious NPC in SKYRIM, waiting to be killed.\n\n- You have to pay some extra money for being able to carry more arrows and stuff with you. Greedy evil developers, you won't make some friends with that greedy mentality. Why not making a good game instead of such a garbage? It's an insult for every gamer. What comes next, paying extra to be able to use a save slot or having a HUD?\n\n- Freeroaming? Nope. You can enter some houses in the City, but you always have to open a window, which kinda loads a new level and is isolated. While you can explore the whole city, the different sections / segments are always blocked by some crates or stuff that has been put there for only this reasons. You can trigger another QTE which will move Garrett through that pile of wooden crates to the next section. That's not the idea of a city, folks.\n\n- Your "home" is the clocktower. Garrett hoards his collection of collectibles there. I was looking forward to explore it after seeing it in the first mission. But the clocktower is just a tiny boring level itself with nothing but your stolen collections to see. When you leave/enter the Clocktower via the only window, it asks you if you want to load a new chapter / the City or enter the Clocktower, so no exploring or fun here. AGAIN.\n\n- You can't jump. This is sometimes a good idea and not a problem, but you can't even jump over traps.\n\n- I absolutely hated those flashback-psycho-levels where you're in some kind of limbus / dreamworld. Can we maybe JUST have some cool levels where I actually can be a MASTER THIEF and steal things? Like from a well guarded museum, bank or something? Why do they always have to include some boring psycho-bull? And of course they had to include some gollum-like creatures. Because we all LOVED those strange aliencreatures from T1, right?\n\n- Customers have to pay extra for a bank heist mission. Are you serious? The only thing that could've made T4 interesting is not incluced.\n\n- You can buy arrows and other stuff from merchants.\nIf I'm not mistaken, then I'm a Thief, oh, pardon, a MASTER Thief, why the heck to I have to pay for stuff?\n\n- You have to have some tools like a wrench (for opening vents) or a razor tool (for cutting picturesout of the frame) for a ridiculous high amount of gold.\nPardon me? I'm a thief, I steal necklases and rings that are worth a s---load of money but I have to unlock / buy a razor or a wrench, which can be a) stolen from everywhere or b) bought for a nickel? Get outta here, this game got more bull by the minute.\n\n- You also can buy (BUY, like in "actually spending gold") a warm undershirt, which increases your health.\nWell, I don't know what to say anymore.\n\nI did not finish the game after starting Mission 7/8. Also, I don't know if they just ran out of ideas or if they are drunk in general, but this game is just plain horrible and a waste of money. This franchise and idea has (had?) so much potential, but it's completely wasted by some failures which really don't have to be.\n\nDo not buy when it costs more than 5 to 10 bucks.","September 5, 2014","false","12.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

This is an unforgivable sin, and this is why The Master Builder hath smitten thee!\n\nThis is a good game when you play it deciding to forget the first three games, but if you're a veteran there's a bunch of things that are difficult to stomach.  Stealth isn't absolutely necessary.  What?  Isn't this supposed to be Thief, stealth pioneer?  I love the city, and the story isn't bad.  But not far into it, I realized that I seemed to be playing Batman.  That made it feel like a bit of a rip off.\n\nI suppose that if you’re going to do a Thief Reboot, the best way would be to start over and redo “The Dark Project” better than it has ever been done before.  There were elements of the original game that I did not like, for example the terrible character design, anything having to do with burricks, the miscarriage that was the lost city, and how it always dumped the player off in a menu screen following the successful completion of a mission.  It would be neat to start over with Garrett as a boy in the streets of the current city and do a little background on how he went from Keeper Acolyte to Thief.  I know Garrett now, and I don’t believe he simply did it out of greed.\n\nBut I don’t think it ever needs to be a first-person-shooter.  Garrett, in addition to being a thief, is also an adventurer, an investigator, and an explorer.  Build him a City that allows him to be creative in his approach to getting his ill-gotten gains and discover his forbidden intel.\n\nAnd as for Erin, I think old Garrett is about due for a love interest, and this was a good try.  I sincerely hope that Eidos and Square-Enix doesn’t give up on the title, but I also hope they all have the humility to learn from their mistakes.","March 14, 2015","true","184.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

I would suggest drinking a large amount of alcohol before you play, so that you can experience the game with the added bonus of not remembering exactly what it was you put yourself through afterwards.\n\nYou will have played it, because you're a fan of the franchise, but you need never recall the sound glitches, the laughable 'plot', or the frustrating city navigation. You need never spend hours waiting for any indication that the devs even bothered to read the wikipedia articles about the games previous installments, let alone played them.\n\nIn your mind, Garrett can remain the somewhat mysterious, sarcastic rogue whos smirk you gladly mirrored as you slipped through the shadows like the morally bankrupt anti hero the title implies you are. (Not that you’re even playing that Garrett, I’m sorry, did you think you were playing that Garrett? You’re totally not! This game is set literally hundreds of years later, duh!)\n\nIf you aren't? Sure go ahead and get it, it’s a pretty standard AAA with a decent amount of playtime and side missions.

I tried to like it, I really did. This game spits in the face of the old games. I just can't believe that someone could ruin a franchise like this. The storyline is terrible and contrived. The character development is just a cut above "See Spot Run", you feel funneled and everything is crazy linear. The lack of a jump action is so incredibly limiting, the old games in the series allowed full exploration via the ability to jump and rope arrows that could attach to any material soft enough for the arrow to sink in which was very abundant. Instead you can look forward to using your rope arrows in predesignated spots so that you are more easily funneled through the Stanley Para... I mean Thief game... I can't stress enough how the sense of player agency just does not exist in this game. Everything is all quicktime, quicktime in disguise, and you feel like you're stuck on a crappy rail ride in an even crappier "amusement" park.

I didn't come from the classic thief games but I do enjoy the modern day stealth games.\n\nThis is technically as advertised but it just doesn't have a good feel. You are artificially blocked from doing some things -- like climbing and you can't jump (which is freakin' weird in a modern FPS game). A point where it looks like you should be able to climb, you simply can't.\n\nFurthermore (and the bigger problem) is the further you get in the game, the bugger it gets. For example, the game just crashed on me but prior to that, I was trying to access a note from the menu but every attempt to open the note failed. it's almost like the down arrow was being held down. (It's not my keyboard as I have no problem now that I'm back in windows.)\n\nPrior to this rather large bug, I saw visual glitches, which I excused as I really, really wanted to like this game. I've been trying to convince myself for the past 2 days. But I can't. It's fine but I can't recommend it. Pick up dishonored or Spinter cell instead..

I'm quite close to the end, but I don't care about finishing the game anymore. I have been doing a fair number of side missions, but still: 20 hours in, and I don't care about what's going on. It's full of clichés, such as the empty wheelchair rolling towards you in the corridor of the haunted mental asylum (seriously), and other games do everything here better. Get Dishonored and its Brigmore Witches DLC instead.\n\nA big problem is the city that connects everything. Familiarity breeds contempt, and you often have a lot of ground to cover to get from NPC to NPC which leaves the big feeling both big and small at the same time. You start to wish that some of the side mission characters might reward you with a fast travel option to other points on the map, given that you can't earn useful items from that work. Instead, we are forced to walk everywhere through a city that's bizarrely lacking interconnection. Often, you need to find an exact window to let you through into another city section. It is torturously stubborn when you're trying to get from A to B, and worse because of the completely unnecessary amount of loading points. Even with an SSD, this is still irritating. You'll quickly learn to hate the identical animations for squeezing through a tight space and the QTE to move the same fallen beam, and the "Hold X, now tap X repeatedly" thing for windows (which I could forgive if it was ever about a subtle movement to avoid being heard, but you will never be heard).\n\nThis tediousness feeds into everything. I was playing for a long time wondering when I'd finally get a razor to steal paintings, or a wirecutter to disable traps, when Googling the problem finally told me that only one trader in the entire city sells those. This is one of many things in this dreary game that just makes you think, "♥♥♥♥ you, Eidos".\n\nMany reviews allege that the graphics are great, a viewpoint with which I strongly disagree. Animations, modelling and textures are pretty basic and old-fashioned. Swinging censers wreathed in smoke simply move their smoke field with them. Graphics settings appear to do very little to help or hurt the framerate, which is bizarrely low considering the lack of demand here (I have a 4GB Nvidia card, and it cannot keep the rate above 60fps at 1080p).","December 23, 2015","false","20.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","9","14","2","0"

I recommend the second :)\nIf you want a modern, triple A spiritual successor to the Thief series that also allows for some really fun action gameplay, go play Dishonored.\nThief 2014 is not wasted money, but definitely money that could have been spent better.\n\nMy opinions on some major gameplay-related elements:\n\nGameplay.\nThe stealth gameplay is there and it's not bad. Sure, now you can see the alert status of enemies, but on the other hand I feel like their AI has been slightly improved: for example, they react to doors being opened\closed.\nThe parkour stuff is really fun in theory, but you're limited to the places that the game decides for you (and conveniently color-codes for you). As a lot of other people pointed out, Thief I and II did this in a much more fun and creative way with the old rope arrows, fifteen years ago.\nThere's a lot of potential for action gameplay and lots of upgrades, if you're into that; although it's kinda dull.\nFocus mode is basically Batman detective mode and conveniently highlights all the important things for you. It feels like cheating and it's kinda sad it was put in to begin with, but it can be safely ignored.\nThere are also several action sequences and even QTEs. You can close your eyes when they come up, I guess.\n\nLevel design.\nYou could easily get lost in the old Thief games. The levels were huge and in order to figure out where your objective(s) was you could only rely on a minimalistic map, plus whatever hints you could find. In this game, on the other hand, you have an objective marker and a real-time minimap. The streamlining is also pretty noticeable: there's always a direction that's the correct one and in order to progress you have to keep moving in that direction; often times the game is even so kind as to close off parts of the level once you've reached a certain point.\nSince I'm on the topic of level design, this might be a good moment to mention how dark this game is. Not dark as in “it's night”, dark as in “there is no concept of brightness in this universe”: most things are black, grey or brown, any other color is actually a bleak shade of whatever that color is supposed to be. This has the double effect of making every level look the same and being pretty tiring on the eyes (in my experience, at least).\n\nEnemies.\nThere are quite literally two enemies in this game. The standard human guard, and the freaks. The freaks are... the freaks. They all look the same and only appear a bunch of times, but at least they're pretty creepy and sneaking around them is slightly different. On the other hand, officers of the City Watch, Graven mob and random thugs are visually undistinguishable from each other unless you're actually in their face, and their “personalities” are the same: they all repeat the same lines constantly, relentlessly, until you know them by heart.\nIn a game like Thief you need a decently varied array of enemies, both for gameplay purposes and to make the universe more engaging.\n\nOpen world.\nThief is an open world game. There's a (supposedly) sprawling city which you need to move through in order to reach the starting points of the game's chapters; and which you can explore to discover all its secrets. At first you're going to be awestruck by how big it is: so full of alternate routes, so full of secrets to find... but all that excitement is going to quickly disappear around the second time you're sneaking through the long path you're forced to take in order to get where you need to get, while you're trying to make sense of the map (spoiler: you'll never be able to make sense of the map). And you'll have to do this again, and again, and again.\nIf all of this sounds familiar, congratulations, you've played Thief III! Except the City in the previous game wasn't as confusing, if I recall correctly.\n\n\nMore ramblings of a salty fanboy\nThese are mostly minor nitpicks. You can safely stop reading here.\n\nThe plot.\nIn the old games the plot was some kind of creepy big conspiracy that Garrett stumbles upon because he's always where he isn't supposed to be; and it slowly built up level by level. Here they try really hard to make it extremely personal from the very beginning, but they do so using a character that's barely introduced and a world whose only inhabitants are idiot clones who spend their time wondering what's in the sloop.\nThe plot is also at the same time predictably clichè and ridiculously vague. “Oh no, the bad guy wants to use the vaguely defined plot device to do... something! Oh no, now a new bad guy wants to use the vaguely defined plot device to do something else!”.\n\nContinuity\nI can tell they decided to ignore all the series' lore because they thought burricks, treebeasts, haunts , automatons etc... weren't bleak enough for this modern triple A masterpiece of bleakness. The Pagans with their hilarious broken English and their creepy wood witch vibe are gone. The holier-than-thou, priests-turned-engineers Hammerites are gone. The Builder and the Trickster are gone. So how do you deal with making a sequel\reboot to a series while at the same time not wanting to use that series' lore, but wanting to keep the main character? Simple: you set it sometime in the future and make it so Garrett isn't actually Garrett, but another guy named Garrett who looks very similar to Garrett and is also an incredibly skilled thief, also has a fence who is coincidentally named Basso... you get the idea. And this is not a complete reboot, mind you, it's officially a future version of the old Thief world. You can check the wiki[thiefgame.wikia.com] to read more about it, because you sure as hell won't get more info by playing the game.\nLong story short, you can probably guess that I'm very salty about the complicated stupidity of this game's continuity and lore.\n\nAudio bugs\nThe in-game meThe in-game mechanism The in-game mechanism that triggers dialogues is at the very least questionable.that triggers dialogues is at the very least questionable.chaThe in-game mechanism that triggers dialogues is at the vThe in-game mechanism that triggers dialogues is at the very least questionable.ery least questionable.nism that triggers dThe in-game meThe in-game mechanism that triggers dialogues is at the very least questionable.chanism that triggers dialogues is at the very least questionable.ialogues is at the vThe in-game mThe in-game mechanism that triggers dialogues is at the verymechanism that triggers dialogues is at the very least questionable.ery least questionable.\n\nBleakness\nI've already talked a bit about how hard this game tries to be bleak, but I feel the best way to convey what it's like and also why I can't take it seriously is to write some sample dialogue, the kind that you'll hear constantly through the game.\nGuy #1: “My shift of ♥♥♥♥-shoveling is over.

Sometimes you have to travel 2,3 times even go to place like 100meter as map indicator and load 2,3 times. the open world are too small.\n- time are night time only, never morning (though game emphasizing theif stealth game mode, would like to see day-night cycle)\n-(spoiler alert) story are too linear and not that attractive, when comes to the part finding enrin, it's actually become horror 1st person gaming (it's fun, but damn horror man).\n-not much of parkour/climbing (was expecting much, my fault)\n-not much of upgrade\n-only 2 place to buy item/refill item?? (so far i see two, haven't finish the game), damn. I have to go certain area, loan a new area, then find that guy to buy item/refill.

Though now I think I will as I can't play this...\n- This issue doesn't just effect me, other people have had it too, amoungst many others.\n\nThief is a dark, stealth/action game where you play as a thief known as Garrett. From the small portion that I played, the game features some unique thieving mechanics that may also work well for the rest of the game (I wouldn't know unfortunately). The game's visuals are very pleasing and I'm glad to say that the steam store's screenshots are pretty accurate.\n\nUnfortunately though, there is a downside... Otherwise this review wouldn't be a "not recommended" review would it? Yes, Thief (4) is riddled with issues. A quick trip to the community Hub would have told me that this game was a gamble to purchase... Well, now I don't like gambling. You see, I started thief up and was met by the menu screen. Great! I thought, all seems well. Apparently not. The game (at least for me) features a horrible jagged/laggy/stuttering bug when V-sync is enabled, causing any movement with WASD+Mouse to result in a CCTV-esque movement to everything. Disabling V-sync does reduce the issue, but it causes my GTX660ti to heat up to a concerning level.\n\nIn the end, I didn't spend much time playing thief, though I would have liked to.. I've been searching google, steam, and throughout the bowels of the internet to get the issue resolved. No dice.\n\n(I tried Nvidia Inspector, messing with the ThiefEngine and BaseEngine files, Sweet FX, Nvidia Control Panel, even in-game settings (Textures low etc)... Nothing worked. It was either no-vsync or preserve my GPU... I chose the GPU). If the issue gets resolved and I can eventually play the game properly, I'd happily update the review. But for now, I just can't play it with it's current v-sync issue.\n\n**Feedback / Suggestions welcome. I don't hate this game, I'm just unhappy that I bought a game which I cannot play; I just cannot enjoy it when the movement/looking around is so jarring and uncomfortable to watch.","November 26, 2014","false","1.6"," 24 of 43 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","24","43","0","0"

My opinion on Thief comes from Thief and Thief alone.\n\nWhile having potential, Thief lacks what most stealth games do: an element of stealth.\n\nThe stealth aspect is virtually non-existant. Enemies will not notice you so long as you are crouched, swooping, walking, or otherwise in the shadows. Nevermind the fact that they're mere inches from your face in an ominous alleyway. When their guard is down, they are completely oblivious. When their guard should otherwise be up, they are still completely oblivious. It is entirely possible to crouch by a group of guards in plain sight with little to no reaction beyond a "What was that?"\n\nToo often are there instances where the game provides little to no ingenuity. While each map supposedly has "multiple paths" for the player to take, the paths are few and far between, with little to no deviation from a linear trajectory. The maps are set up to allow you to find your own way to get from point A to point B, but after starting your path, it's simply a matter of holding down a few keys until you arrive at your destination.\n\nOn top of all else, the controls are needlessly bizzare. Let us assume you wish to hop down from a rope you're climbing. One would expect the jump key while looking downward would do so, or perhaps the crouch key. One would be wrong. Instead it's required to bind seperate keys to all of these commands. Instead of grouping together contextual keys in a sensible fashion, Thief takes the approach of "4 keys for 1 action", leaving you scrambling for the correct key when another should do the same thing. Each additional bind is purely contextual, rendering the alternative bindings useless save for specific situations, and indicating that Thief missed the simple concept of one key being able to do multiple actions in order to allow the player to respond more quickly. To top off the controls, Thief's handling of input commands is lackluster. It often requires multiple key presses before any one action is actually completed. So expect to fall to your death a couple dozen times before Garrett finally decides to hop that 2-foot gap in front of him.\n\nAll in all, while Thief seems appealing, it utterly lacks in any and all expected components.","March 1, 2014","false","4.5"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

To be able to immerse yourself so wholly in the experience that you can literally spend the entire day in a single level, sneaking about and accomplishing the mission so perfectly that you are seen only when the pathing of enemies makes it 100% impossible, that you never have to swing your weapon save to possibly knock out a guard or two by necessity.\n\nIf nothing else, the core divide I feel is that the original Thief felt like I was actually taking things in logical places from some jerks. This game feels as hollow and forced as smalltalk with a stranger on the street waiting in line for the bus.\n\nLoot is obvious, and placed everywhere without sentiment for retaining the 4th wall - as if they all agreed that if Mario can place floating coins you jump at and feel gratified then so can we!\n\nI feel as sneaky as a rusty shopping cart, and get the sense that the character is as much a Thief as an uninformed constituent is a Voter.

With my new instructions I began following the linear road to a door upon which I found a small object on a table. I grabbed it, handed it back to the fine chap of a brick.

A lot of talk over the internet from fans of the series suggested that from trailers and gameplay shown before the release of this game, it was considered things like not living up to the original Thief games and that this game will flop. I tried my best through my play of this game to advert my thinking of the game in such a way but by the end of it all I have to agree with what everyone is saying about this game. I wanted something good out of this game, the first big "next gen" game to be released and it did flop, so badly that by the end, I just wanted Thief to finish so I could never play it again.\n\nThe game has bad design choices in many aspects from the forced animations ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to the repetive sequences such as knocking out a guard or going through a small crack inbetween areas. The story was lackluster, voice acting sub par. Music was fair in certain cases but it gets really annoying when I'm somewhat in the mood of the setting and suddenly a "clash" everytime I take down someone. Graphics was the only redeeming factor about this game but even then, it still ran like ♥♥♥♥ in some cases. Loading times weren't an issue as a few people had mentioned.AI is stupid as well as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t sometimes with their ability to never miss and persistent idiocy to search forever but instantly give up.\n\nIn the end, this game was a massive disappointment and I'd rather finish Dishonored 3 times over and enjoy myself than play this game again. I truely hope there ISN'T a sequel to this game because if they did make one, I'd have to triple check, no, a million check to make sure the game isn't ♥♥♥♥.\n\nTL:DR 6/10 playable but ♥♥♥♥.","March 1, 2014","false","8.0"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","1"

I wasn't a huge fan, but I really enjoyed them. I was so stoked when this game came out, but I was very quickly disappointed. I think the old games were so good because they were a fresh style of gameplay in their time. This game felt like Wal-mart's "Great Value" brand Reduced sodium Saltine crackers taste....BLAND.\n\nThe biggest sin this game commited was its storytelling. Cliche's galore! The ending was so.....bad. It felt like they wanted to keep it open for a sequel, but they made Garrett look like such a fool. There were shopkeepers to sell arrows and such in the most unusual locations. You never had to worry about conserving ammunition before an important event because. BAM, out of nowhere, a guy offering items for all your "nefarious needs."\n\nWhich brings me to my next big sin. The voice acting. Zero emotion, zero talent. I got so sick of hearing the same back and forth banter that never changed or had variation throughout the whole game. I would think that at least Garrett would have a good voice actor, but it sounded like the guy the voiced Garrett did it while lying down on his couch.\n\nThe AI was horrendous. They would see you kill a fellow guard in cold blood, and once you hid for about 1 minute, they would say, "whoever it was, he's gone now," and go back to their exact same patrol route. No more guards would be summoned, nothing. They either knew exactly where you were, or had no idea. There was no searching around until they found you. For the first 3 chapters, if a torch was extinguished by a water arrow, they reacted to it. After that, they must have had a memo go around the Pony Express for the guards, that ordered them to stop reacting to that nonsense.\n\nLastly, the level design. It was probably one of the most linear games since Contra for the NES (Contra was an epic game...this, was not). You usually had ONE path you could take to get somewhere. If there were two choices, it was either, stealth path, or fight guards path. There were more doors and windows you couldnt go in, than words spoken in the game. You could only climb in very particular places.\n\nSO, SO.....SOOO BAD!!! This game is DREAFUL!!! For the love of Pete~~! Don't spend money on this game!!

I had sub-zero expectaitons and was growing increasingly horrified by the reboot with each new trailer and gameplay video. Having now played a reasonable amount of the game, I can say that despite all the complaints oldschool Thief fans have, it's actually a solid experience that feels satisfying and thiefy at its core.\n\nDespite the lack of Hammerites / Mechanists / Stephen Russell / etc, the game provides enough tweaks to turn it into an experience very close to the originals. Even if story missions are smaller, the city hub is a lot of fun to explore and loot. You can strip the on-screen feedback to just the light gem and explore using your brains and your senses, which is actually what Thief is all about.\n\nI hated and laughed at this game before I played it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KitsuneKelso/recommended/239160/","KitsuneKelso","Kelso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KitsuneKelso/","1591 products in account","So, the new Thief game has come and a lot of people have a lot of oppinions on it. Personally, the old Thief games are some of my all time favourites and I gladly place Thief 1 & 2 at some point in my Top 10 list of best games ever. I am also a big fan of the more recent Dishonored game, really hoping for a sequel there, and I hold it as the true spiritual successor to the old Thief games. So how does this new, actual THIEF Thief game hold up?\n\nI am glad to say that I enjoyed it! When judges on it's own merrits, it is a very enjoyable experience with some great gameplay throughout. The story is a bit simplistic, especially when compared to the old games stories, but there are a lot of layers to the story and the universe that you really have to dig for to get a glimpse of. For example, there is a very interesting theory circulating that this Thief game actually takes place in the same universe as the old games, only set about 800 or so years into the future, with this games Garret being a sort of reincarnation of the old games Garret. There is a theme about the cyclical nature of time in the game, and there's a side-quest in particular that discusses the idea of all parts of time existing at the same time all the time (sorry if it sounds a bit confusing from my explanation), but it would make sense that this story could be a continuation as well as a reboot at the same time.\n\nThe best part of the game is clearly the gameplay, and stealing things really takes the main stage, as is appropriate. There is almost always something to steal in any part of the environment, and sometimes you happen upon special loot that is especially valuable. A lot of it is also hidden or contained in special places where you actively need to find the loot or figure out how to unlock it in some very intricate ways, which gives a thorough player a great sense of rewarding the dedicated playstyle. The addition of the "swooping" mechanic to Garrets moveset is also really enjoyable, and it works as a sort of counter to the "Blink" ability that was the absolute best part of the stealth system in Dishonored.\n\nIt is very interesting to observe the evolution of the first person stealth genre visible here, as the original Thief games so strongly influenced the development of Dishonored, where they borrowed elements very hevily and used them to an extremely good extent, whereupon the developers here for the new Thief game were very heavily inspired by the style and development of Dishonored in turn. A great example is the three-part introduction to the world of the game that both Dishonored used (Tales from Dunwall) as well as Thief (Stories from The City).\n\nThere are some aspects that detract from the overall experience of Thief, however. There are a couple of times when bugs can ruin the immersion, however they were fairly infrequent and none of them were really game-breaking. The worst one I ran into was durring a chapter where you ride in an evelvator and at the end of the ride have to climb out through a hatch in the top of the elevator. Upon trying to climb up, Garret got caught in a hanging-animation from the hatch and refused to climb up. After trying to climb, and then letting go and trying again, I was finally able to get on top of the elevator on my third or fourth try, so the problem solved itself after all. Problems like this, however, are rather frustrating to run into, even if they never ruin the experience completely.\n\nThe navigation system can also be somewhat frustrating at times, due mainly to the fact that there is no real "jump" button in the game. The player can only perform a leap of some kind at certain points, like near an edge to jump accross to another platform. At times this jump can behave unexpectedly, however, and sometimes even gets the player killed. An example is any situation where you need to jump to a hanging rope, where you need to be perfectly aligned with the rope and do the exact kind of jump the game asks you for. If you don't, Garret won't aim for the rope and can sometimes instead just jump of the platform and throw himself to his death. This happened a couple of times durring my playthrough and it got very frustrating at some points.\n\nOverall, however, I would possitively recommend this game to everyone. If you're an old Thief player, or if you enjoyed Dishonored, you will be able to get a lot of enjoyment out of this game if you are able to judge the game based on it's own merrits rather than only comparing it to how great the originals were. Even though I absolutely love the old games, as I said, I was able to accept the changes the developers had made to the mechanics and I ended up enjoying the new Thief game a whole lot. And if you're a gamer that hasn't yet experienced this type of game, I would also recommend it, as it is a pretty nice introduction to stealth mechanics with a very well designed game. However, for these types of people I would probably also suggest that you give at least Dishonored a try before hand, as it is the most well designed stealth game of the modern era. While I would also suggest the old Thief games, they can be very challenging to a newer player, but if you are brave enough (both figurativelly and litterally), you should definitely give them a try as well, you won't regrett it!\n\nAs a final touch, I have to compliment Thief on being a ridiculously well ported/optimised game with some amazing graphical options on all fronts. Running the game at max settings is also a true treat for the senses as the world is strictly beautifull to behold both visually as well as through it's audio. Finally, I have to say I really enjoyed the new voice actor for Garret. While not as amazing as the originals Stephen Russell, the new voice actor manages to capture the feeling of Garrets personality and his internal monologues really well. At times, his delivery made it feel like I was playing the old games again, which is a really nice thing indeed.","March 11, 2014","true","18.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Absent or lame characters, world feels bare & empty. Garret is too silent compared to previous games & unable to jump (maybe he's now too old for that haha). Another bad thing: you will often see Garett's face, which shouldn't be. Tiny & boring levels and no pleasure from exploring/discovering: everything is painted/scratched for you to see the possible routes, only blind players would miss them... Level layout is really bad. Gated gameplay: go THERE, do THAT, etc. Annoying Scripted sequences that you'll have to restart several times. Knocking people is bad, M'okay? So forget about the previous games where it was the hype thing to do lol. To top it all it's rather ugly, with no colors and oddly enough no mirrors (maybe it's my settings though). The AI is ridiculous. A lot seem like stolen from Dishonored: the guards' uniforms, the illness thing and a lot of the decor stuff.\nIn conclusion: I cannot believe what I'm going to say but the average Thief 3 is waaaaay better than this! So huh?! How come? I tried to love the game, you can see that I have put a lot of hours in it & I still have some stuff to do in it but playing more than an hour at the time is too ***ing boring.

It's not a bad game... but not a great game either. Given I didn't play the original games so this reboot was my first playthrough in the series. And I liked it actually... but also there are so many flaws in the game. Wish there is a mixed option for games like this. If we are talking about a numerical value I'd give 6 or 6.5 out from 10 to this game.\n\nThere is no background or prequel story (as I said that was my first game from the series) but still I kinda wished they told new players what are the Thief games about. It just stars "in medias res" without any further ado. Just play and have fun.\n\nAlso I didn't like when the game went from stealth to horror in chapter 5. Overally I enjoyed the game but that chapter was too creepy imo and didn't fit the style of the whole. Other than that the overall story is nice but just a bit shallow.\n\nAs I was writing this Dishonored came up in my mind so many times. I know not every game should be Dishonored but one must compare the two games and honestly Dishonored 100% better than this. From every point of view. And that's my biggest problem. Because this game could have been so much better. Like it fails on every single thing but not by a huge margin... yet still enough to notice the negativities.\n\nI got the game through the Square Enix Humble Bundle and honestly that was a good price for it (considering I also got a lot of other games too).\n\nBut long story short: don't buy this game for full price. It's 5,99€ if it has a 80% sale and honestly you shouldn't pay more than that.","March 8","true","11.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game graphics look good, the feel of the world is there and is satisfying enough. The story has legs and feet up till a point.

It gets tedious opening every drawer or cabinet in a house and the small rewards are not worth it.\n\nThe game has a central city hub you can explore between missions, but there's so many loading screens that you'll give up on that after a couple of hours. Some loading screens are disguised by long animations (opening a window,...), often revealing a small 1 or 2 room apartment behind them.\n\nThe graphics are good, but the game is mostly grey and brown wooden buildings. Some more variation and color would have been welcome.\n\nSound has bigger problems. Voice lines repeat constantly, guards talk over each other and some guards say multiple lines at the same time.\nWhile walking around the city you'll overhear conversations between citizens, but it's always voices coming from a closed window or door. It feels very fake and doesn't make the city feel alive. The few civilians you do see just stand around doing nothing.\n\nThe game isn't awful (and the story missions don't have most of these problems), but it wasn't interesting enough to make me put up with the constant loading screens and repetitive thieving.","June 28, 2014","false","10.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

However, while it may sound good as a tagline (or maybe it doesn't) it's not as good as I thought it'd be. I got an email from Steam telling me that it was on sale for 66% off I believe and I love Steam sales so I paid about $12 for it and it's about as worth that much to me.\n\nMaybe a little harsh? You would think the same if you were like me and played it yourself. The main problems I have with the game are how the map is very difficult to follow and I found myself getting lost in the Stonemarket area while trying to complete some extra jobs for clients. I also felt that the UI/HUD was a little poorly done, I'm not quite sure what it was about it I didn't like so I can't offer a better review on that aspect. I looked briefly, before the purchase, at other reviews and saw that it didn't get really good reviews and I should've known better before I decided to buy it, but I wanted to still give it a shot anyways, to try and be more fair and give the makers of the game the benefit of the doubt.

But the AI tends to spot you sometimes even when you are completely hidden. Visually the game looks pretty nice. It's a tad bit too dark at times (depending on the environment, of course). Combat system is terrible, which almost forces you to sneak and stay out of sight, regardless of  your playstyle. When in combat, you can only melee and duck. Which not only is boring, but feels clunky. I found myself loading a previous save whenever I was spotted to avoid altercations. The story is very, very forgetable. There were a few times where I had no idea what was actually going on. Maybe it was just boring to me and didn't catch my interest. Voice acting was the worst/funniest I've ever experienced. It's overly exaggerated and forced and the poor writing was not in the actors favor. In conclusion, I only paid 7 dolars for the game, so I can't complain too much. I honestly wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Save your Steam monies.","January 7, 2015","false","8.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Iyerbeth/recommended/239160/","Iyerbeth","Iyerbeth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Iyerbeth/","690 products in account","As a fan of the series I was very worried by the early footage of this game and felt pretty sure they were going to ruin the series.  Fortunately they do seem to have corrected a lot of issues such that I feel I can recommend the game, but it's definitely worth noting there are problems.\n\nShort Summary\n\nFor those who want a brief summary, here's the short version first.  The game lacks polish, the level design isn't always up to par, dialogue gets repetitive at times and the story is just annoying and thoroughly awful.  It feels like 30 different people all want to tell their story and you get an incoherent noise where you can pick up some ideas from different stories.  That said, the game is still at its heart a Thief game.  If you want a traditional stealth game you can definitely find it here, especially with the remarkable amount of customisation available, and the actual gameplay itself is sufficient that I would recommend looking past the problems.\n\nReview\n\nSo this Thief game is a series reboot which means that there is no story you're missing if you're new to the series.  There are some nods to older fans but nothing particularly relevant.  There is a central hub city where routes through open up as you advance through the main missions and there is a reasonable amount of exploration and side missions to be found.  The missions, and bigger side quests, all take place in separate levels you access by finding them around the city.\n\nThe design of the mission areas is hit and miss, with some fairly competent design let down by other areas clearly influenced by the earlier path the game was taking and, frustratingly, late in the game there are boss fights which is never a good thing in a stealth game.  Given they don't break character by forcing an actual altercation it isn't as terrible as it could have been, they all the same feel frustratingly out of place and should at least be a consequence of gameplay rather than something you just have to live with.\n\nAnother, more significant addition to the game is focus mode.  With this you can look around your world to highlight loot, hidden buttons or things you can use.  It can also be upgraded to provide a lot of additional upgrades in pickpocketing and lock picking, combat and stealth mechanics.  Whilst I welcome the mechanic being available to help people through the game and make it less frustrating, if you're really in to stealth games you're going to find it makes things a bit easy as the game goes on, especially as you can use it when your focus meter is empty whenever you want to get a lingering highlight of the important things in the world. Fortunately it can be disabled, but only when you're selecting starting difficulty settings.\n\nCustomisation is really the strongest part of the game and really sets a standard I'd like to see in more games.  First the PC port of this game has a great options menu with everything you could really want.  The options continue though in the difficulty of the game, with 3 base difficulties but also custom options you can use to tailor the game to what you want.  A few examples include disabling focus mode, no kills or knockouts, no alerts allowed and many more up to even Iron Man where failing or dying means you have to start from the beginning of the game.  The game continues though, with every single element of the HUD being able to be turned off (including loot glint and lock pick help) or being given a timed fade away for things like health bars.  You really can set this game up how you want it and it's remarkable in that sense.\n\nSeveral other aspects of the game are done very well; the character feels like they're really in the world, with the use of limbs and the way the character interacts with things giving a real sense of there really being a person there.  You can learn quite a bit about the world by eavesdropping, spying on people and some reasonably well written documents and it feels reasonably organic.  The swoop feature (where you quietly dash forward) also feels really good to use and actually adds rather well to some tense stealth sections.\n\nThe AI in the game is sometimes quite good, noticing things on their patrol route have been opened and being reasonably consistent in its detection of you or otherwise.  Other times though it will bug out, will get stuck on doors, not notice really obvious things, or notice really unobvious things such as you, through a wall, one floor down, in the shadows.  It's usually alright but sometimes feels a bit under-polished, which is a phrase that would describe a lot of the game quite well unfortunately.\n\nThe world sometimes feels a bit lifeless, people have set paths with very limited dialogue options that repeat annoyingly often - you will sometimes hear 3 or 4 guards in a row repeat the exact same thing.  Some rather useful information is hidden in loading screens, such as pressing X to let go of ropes, which leads to perfectly functioning aspects of the game feeling annoying.  Sometimes your character will drop off ledges; sometimes you need to use the drop button.  Sometimes you can leave vents; sometimes you will need to try repeatedly.  Sometimes you will loot the draw with a context sensitive button; sometimes it'll move away and look around a corner with the same context sensitive button.  These kinds of things give the game the feeling of just not quite being finished.\n\nFinally, the biggest problem with the game is the story, it damages the game.  For one thing it starts pretty bad and just gets worse every single time there is some major advancement in it.  It's so focussed on someone it's very difficult to care about that it is annoying to experience, and to make things worse because you're driven by it you're not so much going to places to steal from them, you're stealing from them on the way through.  As a result of this approach you spend a lot more time stealing cutlery than planning a big heist.  The bank heist DLC comes the closest to this ideal and really shows the potential the game really did have when unencumbered by the mess that is the story.\n\nI appreciate this review sounds quite negative; indeed there is a lot to be negative about.  It is the weakest game in the series, but with its great customisation options you can still find a Thief game in it.  It is, at its heart, a rather competent stealth game and if you're a fan of the genre you will definitely get something out of it.  You do need to look past its rough edges though.","March 30, 2014","true","36.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/integraldude/recommended/239160/","integraldude","Integral dude","http://steamcommunity.com/id/integraldude/","171 products in account","Is the game any good?\nShort answer - Yes it is.\nBUT, the game is plagued by a long history of expectations from previous really good games in this series, and also by troubled development, which makes it much more complicated to talk about. A lot of reviews gave this game a low score, and even though I do understand that point of view partially, I also think it is unfair most of the time.\nWhy? Well, more on that later.\n\nSo what is good about it?\nIt has very good stealth-mechanics. It has fantastic options for customizing your experience. It looks really great. Movement is smooth. It feels great to sneak, run, jump, and swoop. Good atmosphere in general. Hub-world is quite large and filled with many secrets. Many, really great side-missions. Great voice acting overall.\n\nWhat is not so good about it?\nStory feels unfinished and does not make much sense - it is also really cheesy and out of place. Audio is badly optimized at times. Frequent loading-screens in hub-world break immersion. You need quite a powerful machine to run it well. WEIRD April 1st bug, making it possible to complete the game, because of looping the chapter you are currently at. Bypassed by changing your date on the computer, but WHY???\n\nControl:\nMouse and keyboard is the better experience - and it is excellent . Some controllers have fun rumble feedback, but it is not entirely worth it.\n\nSo, why are some reviews unfair?\nBecause of nostalgia:\nSome people have spent so much time into the older games, and they had such a good time playing those games, that they expect exactly the same experience again in later installments.\n\nReboot-hate (stuck in the past)\nYou simply can't repeat  an experience - it is not the same game - It is not the same you. The feeling we remember when we played a game the first time is mostly a nostalgic memory, that is probably a little warped from reality. And with that somewhat warped memory we search for the same feeling in the new game, which we never get - hence we become upset.\n\nI see so many reviewers critiquing the game from this angle, and so the critique is not objective in my mind. Instead of objectiviley looking at the game, everything gets judged as bad, because it does not fit the past. and many seemed to have decided in advance to hate the game no matter what it did. Another reason it is judged badly is partially because the game should be played slowly (I think) - Rushing through the game in order to write a quick review, and I think the essence of the game is mostly lost.\n\nDo we really want the game to be the same as the older ones?\nI would be really disappointed if they made Thief the same game as before with just better graphics, which I feel a lot of people are asking for.\nIf that is what you want, I say go play the old games instead. I'm serious. Those games exist here on steam and GoG, they are still great (and MUCH cheaper), and they have tons of mods, updates, and fan made missions that make these games highly enjoyable.\n\nDevs. Damned if they do, damned if they don't.\nAnd, how do you create a game that is both enjoyable for someone who has hundreds of hours invested, and for someone totally new to the series?  It would, for example, not be commercially viable to create a game just for the SMALL devote thief-community. It is also interesting that most players who are not familiar with the older games really like this new Thief.\n\nIs this game a true thief-game?\nYou hide in the shadows. You can sneak, you can explore, both vertically and horizontally, you have all the interesting arrows and gadgets. The game-mechanics are really good. There is lock-picking (best in the series). The AI chatter is better than ever, even though buggy at times. The atmosphere is very tense, dark and scary. You are weak and vulnerable. There is lots of loot and hidden areas - The game is quite long and re-playable. There is aspects of the supernatural, and the world is kind of steam-punk-medieval.  Sound design is really well made (a part from the bugs), and an integral part of the game.\nSo, yes, it is absolutely a thief-game.\n\nProblems?\nYes, there are quite a few. The most noticeable one is sound in general. Sure, at times the sound is really great, but it just does not seem to be mixed right. Sometimes you don't hear what you should hear, because something else is too loud. Sometimes you hear NPCs that are not in the same room as you, still as loud as they were right next to you. On occasion the music cuts out which makes you wonder if someone saw you, or something happened.\nThe guards seem to get stuck sometimes, but there is always a way to get around them if you have your wits around. But then there is also the occasional issue of some NPCs being completely frozen, or "glitching out". None of the problems are game-breaking, a part of the April 1st bug that truly was a mystery. (You were kept in a loop and could not exit the current mission, when you reloaded a save you always started from the beginning.)\n\nWhat I don't like:\nOh the story... In a way, it seems like they put some real effort into it, and the voice-acting and cut-scenes are nice. But, it also does not seem to head anywhere - Some cut-scenes just did not feel like they fit the situation you were in previously or after.  You get the sensation the story was quickly put together before the deadline, using various ideas all mixed together. You don't care for anyone really.\nAlso, the occasional 3rd person wall climbing, even though not a problem at all, it just doesn't fit in the game - there is no point for this mechanic either. Also, I wished there could have been a little more space for "inventing your own path". All options on how to finish a task or path, were pretty obvious (to me). For example, you can't just use a rope arrow where you like, only at specific places. Frequent loading screens does break immersion - It becomes mostly apparent when you are trying to reach a specific location. The loading-screen times are not awful, and not too frequent, but I was hoping that it would be a little better, considering that was Deadly Shadow's biggest flaw, and I'm a little surprised it's needed with today's hardware - Aren't there ways to load stuff in the background as you progress? At least there are no loading screens during missions anymore (as in Deadly Shadows).\n\nVerdict:\nI say that Thief is a very good game despite its problems. The stealth mechanics, atmosphere and immersion are all fantastic, and the fact that you can highly customize your experience is just icing on the cake. Hopefully patches will come soon to correct the flaws, but the story and direction can't be patched, and it is unfortunately a real mess. But the main mechanics: thieving and sneaking is actually really well done, and the levels are atmospheric and fun, sometimes truly great. The side-missions are really worth your time as well. Then you can of course compete with your friends in terms of how fast you can complete a level, how much loot, knockdowns, ghosting etc. All this clearly makes the game very much worth it.\n\nIf the other thief-games did not exist, if we did not compare with our sometimes questionable nostalgia, more would probably see this game as a really good and unique experience. But some people just decided to hate this game no matter what it is - haters are gonna hate I guess.\n\nI have played all thief games extensively (including fan missions), and I still like this game a lot. In fact, while playing Thief, I kind of forgot my other duties at times; I could not wait to get back in the world.","April 1, 2014","true","39.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game was the first game that ever had me play stealth in first-person which makes it more tense, but also fun. I enjoyed playing through the levels and the stealth mechanics are actually quite great making sure to hide bodies and shut cabinets and cases. I have enjoyed it so far but it of course is not without it's faults. A couple being the hub world is a terrible mess of loading screens and confusing pathways and the bow which seems like an item of paramount importance really doesn't seem to be (while playing I only ever found myself using the water arrows). The story and voice acting is rather plain, but not entirely bad and I would recommend this game only during times of steam sales where I feel the value vs. price is a bit better. 7/10","January 31, 2015","true","11.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/integraldude/recommended/239160/","integraldude","Integral dude","http://steamcommunity.com/id/integraldude/","171 products in account","Is the game any good?\nShort answer - Yes it is.\nBUT, the game is plagued by a long history of expectations from previous really good games in this series, and also by troubled development, which makes it much more complicated to talk about. A lot of reviews gave this game a low score, and even though I do understand that point of view partially, I also think it is unfair most of the time.\nWhy? Well, more on that later.\n\nSo what is good about it?\nIt has very good stealth-mechanics. It has fantastic options for customizing your experience. It looks really great. Movement is smooth. It feels great to sneak, run, jump, and swoop. Good atmosphere in general. Hub-world is quite large and filled with many secrets. Many, really great side-missions. Great voice acting overall.\n\nWhat is not so good about it?\nStory feels unfinished and does not make much sense - it is also really cheesy and out of place. Audio is badly optimized at times. Frequent loading-screens in hub-world break immersion. You need quite a powerful machine to run it well. WEIRD April 1st bug, making it possible to complete the game, because of looping the chapter you are currently at. Bypassed by changing your date on the computer, but WHY???\n\nControl:\nMouse and keyboard is the better experience - and it is excellent . Some controllers have fun rumble feedback, but it is not entirely worth it.\n\nSo, why are some reviews unfair?\nBecause of nostalgia:\nSome people have spent so much time into the older games, and they had such a good time playing those games, that they expect exactly the same experience again in later installments.\n\nReboot-hate (stuck in the past)\nYou simply can't repeat  an experience - it is not the same game - It is not the same you. The feeling we remember when we played a game the first time is mostly a nostalgic memory, that is probably a little warped from reality. And with that somewhat warped memory we search for the same feeling in the new game, which we never get - hence we become upset.\n\nI see so many reviewers critiquing the game from this angle, and so the critique is not objective in my mind. Instead of objectiviley looking at the game, everything gets judged as bad, because it does not fit the past. and many seemed to have decided in advance to hate the game no matter what it did. Another reason it is judged badly is partially because the game should be played slowly (I think) - Rushing through the game in order to write a quick review, and I think the essence of the game is mostly lost.\n\nDo we really want the game to be the same as the older ones?\nI would be really disappointed if they made Thief the same game as before with just better graphics, which I feel a lot of people are asking for.\nIf that is what you want, I say go play the old games instead. I'm serious. Those games exist here on steam and GoG, they are still great (and MUCH cheaper), and they have tons of mods, updates, and fan made missions that make these games highly enjoyable.\n\nDevs. Damned if they do, damned if they don't.\nAnd, how do you create a game that is both enjoyable for someone who has hundreds of hours invested, and for someone totally new to the series?  It would, for example, not be commercially viable to create a game just for the SMALL devote thief-community. It is also interesting that most players who are not familiar with the older games really like this new Thief.\n\nIs this game a true thief-game?\nYou hide in the shadows. You can sneak, you can explore, both vertically and horizontally, you have all the interesting arrows and gadgets. The game-mechanics are really good. There is lock-picking (best in the series). The AI chatter is better than ever, even though buggy at times. The atmosphere is very tense, dark and scary. You are weak and vulnerable. There is lots of loot and hidden areas - The game is quite long and re-playable. There is aspects of the supernatural, and the world is kind of steam-punk-medieval.  Sound design is really well made (a part from the bugs), and an integral part of the game.\nSo, yes, it is absolutely a thief-game.\n\nProblems?\nYes, there are quite a few. The most noticeable one is sound in general. Sure, at times the sound is really great, but it just does not seem to be mixed right. Sometimes you don't hear what you should hear, because something else is too loud. Sometimes you hear NPCs that are not in the same room as you, still as loud as they were right next to you. On occasion the music cuts out which makes you wonder if someone saw you, or something happened.\nThe guards seem to get stuck sometimes, but there is always a way to get around them if you have your wits around. But then there is also the occasional issue of some NPCs being completely frozen, or "glitching out". None of the problems are game-breaking, a part of the April 1st bug that truly was a mystery. (You were kept in a loop and could not exit the current mission, when you reloaded a save you always started from the beginning.)\n\nWhat I don't like:\nOh the story... In a way, it seems like they put some real effort into it, and the voice-acting and cut-scenes are nice. But, it also does not seem to head anywhere - Some cut-scenes just did not feel like they fit the situation you were in previously or after.  You get the sensation the story was quickly put together before the deadline, using various ideas all mixed together. You don't care for anyone really.\nAlso, the occasional 3rd person wall climbing, even though not a problem at all, it just doesn't fit in the game - there is no point for this mechanic either. Also, I wished there could have been a little more space for "inventing your own path". All options on how to finish a task or path, were pretty obvious (to me). For example, you can't just use a rope arrow where you like, only at specific places. Frequent loading screens does break immersion - It becomes mostly apparent when you are trying to reach a specific location. The loading-screen times are not awful, and not too frequent, but I was hoping that it would be a little better, considering that was Deadly Shadow's biggest flaw, and I'm a little surprised it's needed with today's hardware - Aren't there ways to load stuff in the background as you progress? At least there are no loading screens during missions anymore (as in Deadly Shadows).\n\nVerdict:\nI say that Thief is a very good game despite its problems. The stealth mechanics, atmosphere and immersion are all fantastic, and the fact that you can highly customize your experience is just icing on the cake. Hopefully patches will come soon to correct the flaws, but the story and direction can't be patched, and it is unfortunately a real mess. But the main mechanics: thieving and sneaking is actually really well done, and the levels are atmospheric and fun, sometimes truly great. The side-missions are really worth your time as well. Then you can of course compete with your friends in terms of how fast you can complete a level, how much loot, knockdowns, ghosting etc. All this clearly makes the game very much worth it.\n\nIf the other thief-games did not exist, if we did not compare with our sometimes questionable nostalgia, more would probably see this game as a really good and unique experience. But some people just decided to hate this game no matter what it is - haters are gonna hate I guess.\n\nI have played all thief games extensively (including fan missions), and I still like this game a lot. In fact, while playing Thief, I kind of forgot my other duties at times; I could not wait to get back in the world.","April 1, 2014","true","39.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You have a very limited number of lethal arrows, their cost is prohibitive. The AI is very good and there are no apparent ways to cheese your way around, blackjacking everyone, like in the original Thief games. You lack a consistent way of taking out guards if they spot you, so you're forced to use the stealth approach most of the time. The combat is stacked against you and you're certainly no Corvo Attano.\n- the atmosphere is incredibly well executed. The animations are excellent: the way Garret nudges doors closed, the way he  opens chests and safes, his light touch as he feels for hidden buttons behind a painting. The sound effects are very good, the overheard dialogue is great; you'll once again find yourself trying your best to only walk on softs carpets, or standing still in a shadowy nook listening to the guards chat. The lighting effects are gorgous and very reliable in terms of  where you will be hidden and where you will be lit up (with a couple of exceptions, here and there).\n- the world is executed with a clear attention to details. The environment is very rich and believable.\n- it is mostly a linear experience, but there is at least one huge level, open for exploration, that for me counter balances the rest of the game (A Man Apart - Northcrest Manor).\n- the developers put quite a bit of effort into creating missions that feel different and are not just variations of a manor raid. The morgue, the brothel, the ancient ruins, the asylum - they are all memorable locations.\n\nAll in all, Thief isn't the perfect reboot, but I think it's very good if you approach it with an open mind and not expecting a reskinned The Dark Project. It's main weaknesses are that the level design is too linear and that it came out after Dishonored, really. If the developers take into account the feedback they got from the players and focus on a more open level design for a potential sequel, it will be a very good game.","May 21","true","19.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I've already grabbed like 3 dozen of each of the 5 or so types of basic loot. 30 something hair brushes, pens, scissors, etc. This is just dumb. They should have just gotten rid of all common loot, made the game less linear, and only had a few major target items with multiple methods of reaching them. This game feels like a case of no one having the balls to admit that this gameplay structure isn't fun. It's also so dark and void of any color that I tend to get sleepy after 30 minutes. I know it's supposed to be, but with practically no suspense or threat even when caught, I find myself not caring. You can billyjack anyone upside the head and easily dodge sword swings if caught.

But when you've snooped through the same drawers and cabinets, heard the same NPC voices complaing about sloop over and over again, and pushed the same plank of wood out of the way in another back ally for the 100th time, the joy fades fast.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eacob/recommended/239160/","eacob","Stiff Charming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eacob/","129 products in account","So I got this game over the Summer Sale with high expectations.... only to be let down. Alright let me get this clear, Thief is NOT a bad game. Yes I do not recommend it but I can't trash on it either. Thief is an alright but there are a lot of things which really prevent it from being a good game. First of all is game feel. I've played a lot of stealth based games in my time so I would like to think that I know what makes a good stealth game. This game right of the bat does not have that feel which it should aim to have. A big problem for me is that the game feels too slow and clunky most of the time. It gives me a hard time believing that I'm a master thief when all of my movements are slow and incoherent. Thieves should be quick and nimble and I feel that Garrett, in this game, is not. I really wanted to give this game a try and I tried to like it but it's mechanics and controls really prevent me from doing so. Secondly the game lags quite a lot for me. My PC is not a high end PC which can run the newest Crysis with max graphics but I can confidently say that it can run a lot of games on their highest settings. Yet for some reason I get a stable 24 fps when I run Thief, even in the lower settings. Maybe it's something on my end but then again maybe it's not.\n\n\nWant a good stealth game? Play Dishonored. Maybe even play some of the older games in the Thief franchise, which I have not played myself but I've heard that they're fantastic. Reading the other reviews here on Steam makes me feel that my arguments are valid given that a few of my complaints were addressed by other consumers as well. However as with any review I can't guarantee that my experience with the game will be the same as yours. If I didn't convince you to not buy the game then go ahead and buy it, you might have a blast playing it. Then again you might not.\n\nI tried to compliment the game somewhere in this review but the only thing I could think of were the different types of arrows they had in the game.","July 11, 2014","false","2.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jack_Riguel/recommended/239160/","Jack_Riguel","\\chirs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jack_Riguel/","1094 products in account","NOTE: I've added this whole review to my blog which also includes a few bonus images. Check it here: http://opbroadcast.com/?p=144\n\nThere are quite a few top negative responses to Thief, so for the benefit of my friends I thought I should drop some of my own thoughts. I'll preface though: If you're someone who's looking for Thief 4, or a true continuation of the decade-old series, you've come to the wrong place. Even so, I still enjoyed my time with Thief and I'd gladly recommend it if you're a fan of first person stealth-action games.\n\nGraphics and Style:\nThe promotional screenshots for this game are terrible. Just look above and what do you see? Boring monochromatic vistas set in a pseudo-English, steampunk town. Even the gameplay footage above isn't that great. However, once you're in-game, the atmospheric quality is sold incredibly well. This is a dead city, filled with dust and decay. High contrast shadows draw attention to the light sources to create an incredible noir-like environment, and each location has enough unique architecture to keep you interested in exploring the space.\n\nStory:\nThis certainly is the weakest part of Thief. The characters are laughably bad and the voice acting is delivered awkwardly (especially Garret's want-a-be noir quips). Square Enix (mostly from the Edios run studios) has always had a bizarre cast of characters.  (See Hitman's latex nuns, Dues Ex's painfully racist informant, etc.) Accents change on the fly, modern curses are thrown around like a modern rap artist, and the in-game notes are poorly written and unfocused. There are some good points though, in regards to the atmospheric storytelling. Walking through the hub town you'll hear muffled stories through the walls, some simply giving depth to the backstory of the city, while others can potentially provide you with hints on finding hidden loot throughout the world.\n\nGameplay:\nThe meat. The real reason you should be thinking about buying this game. I could talk about all the systems, annoyances and enjoyments, and everything else that made up the 20 or so hours I invested into this game. Many of these things you've probably already heard about elsewhere and have been written on extensively and far better than I could have, so I'll summarize first:\n\nThief was fun.\n\nIt's clear this is a game from the same studio as Dues Ex Human Revolution. Even though it's a separate team, you can't work in the same room as someone without borrowing a few of their ideas. It's also likely the development was influenced by Dishonored, as the game borrows quite a bit from its systems. (Ironic, as Dishonored was also inspired by the classic thief series.) While Dishonored was more of assassination sandbox where the game gives you a few tools, a loose objective, and tells you to have fun, Thief is directed. There's still some alternate paths and open exploration (especially in the hub city), but most of the primary missions give you a series of spaces to navigate through and it's up to you how stealthy or murderous you decide to be. This is especially prevalent in the side-quest missions, which mostly involve one self-contained zone giving you more power to plan your assault, rob your target, and attempt to make it back out in one piece.\n\nOh, and I'll touch on movement for a moment, seeing as the lack of a "jump" key is a heated contention. When you start, it definitely feels weird not being able to jump up on things. However, the game features a surprisingly robust contextual movement system (it's a good thing they haven't invented fingerprinting yet as Garret touches damn near anything he gets close to), so you get used to the flow of movement rather quickly. There was only a few times I had trouble with jumping and most of them involved me trying to get somewhere I probably shouldn't have been anyways. "Swooping" between shadows and cover is tremendously fun though, and while I wish it didn't come with the lack of a jump key, I hope more games include it as a potential action.\n\nIn Conclusion:\nThief is not a fantastic game, and it certainly doesn't live up to the name it's given. But in the moments, and throughout the 20 or so hours I spent with it, I found fun even when it's issues and strange design choices emerged. I even enjoyed it enough to complete most (if not all) of the game's side-quests and collection opportunities, which is more then what I can say about the last dozen or so games I've picked up. Thief is in no way a terrible game. It could have been better, and perhaps with a future installment it might just be. For now though, it's decent, and I'd recommend it.","June 28, 2014","true","20.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Probably not at the top level of detail of current games, but sacrifices a bit on details to gain more realism in enviormnets: putting shadows (which are not just for visual but also affects the gameplay), fog, and cool stuff that makes you feel you actually are in the city.\nGood stuff here let's go with 9/10\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nAs any game of the genre it has some static mechanics like pickpocketing, or forcing doors that become little bit repetitive.\nIt fortunely has no QTE (quick time events) but there are too many times in which you got to spam your e in order to do a single action. Disliked that.\nBy the other hand it brings lots of possibilities to de user so @he can choose how to complete the levels.\nHowever, at the end of each mission, when the statistics appear it calculates strangely and being a stealthy guy that doesn't even knock up guys becomes a very challenging (but not really in the good way) task.\nWhat is true, nevertheless, is that everything is fluid, things happen as expected in real life, guards detect you mostly when they should (despite you are in shadows, which causes them to have a blindness attack and ignore you even 2 steps away).\nFinally, I shouldn't probably be reviewing this part, but lately some games come with bugs and ♥♥♥♥ that only breaks the gameplay and the overall expirience, and I've been very satisfied this game does not have any of these.\nI think I'd be running an 8/10\n\n\nLENGTH:\nAs you can see I spend about 30 hours to complete the first big half of optional quests and the main story. I must say I'm a calm player and i'm not always hesitating to see more, so if I want to spend an hour exploring the city looking for something I miss (even if it's a single purse) I do. I guess you can rush the main story in about 15 hours and you have 60 granted hours if your goal is to complete 100% the game.\nFor this section i'm going with another 8/10\n\nSo we have 9,8,8 why does the overall review show a 7? We are missing a part:\n\nPLOT:\nFar behind my expectations. It's not bad, the world created and the main line of stroy are really not bad (prehaps they are not great or fantastic, but pretty solid though). It's just they could have worked it out a lot more. The end of the game is clear but leaves you with lots of unnecessary questions (and i'm not refering at the question they want as to have an individual answer to, but simple questions which you expect an answer before the end of the games) I miss that "and this is how all is connected" part to enjoy the plot.\n\nI judge a game by the expirience it transfers, not for the cool programing or the fancy graphics. And in this case I finished the game with a "meh.. was good, enjoyed it, far from being a masterpiece, but still... correct".\n\nThat's why i'm giving this part a 5/10\n\nTHE BEST:\nChapter 5. Really enjoyed that moment. The enviorment and feeling that gameplay makes you feel.\n\nTHE WORST:\nMore things of the plot needed to be explained, good backline story but could have been worked out a lot more.\n\nTO SUM UP: If you have a really funny mechanic you can abuse it's ok to focus your game on it, else you will need a strong plot which this game has not. Prefectly build, enjoyable and fun to play, with an EPIC chapter 5 and lots of possiblities. Just doesn't transfer the expirience it could if the plot was more polished.","July 1, 2014","true","33.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I've already grabbed like 3 dozen of each of the 5 or so types of basic loot. 30 something hair brushes, pens, scissors, etc. This is just dumb. They should have just gotten rid of all common loot, made the game less linear, and only had a few major target items with multiple methods of reaching them. This game feels like a case of no one having the balls to admit that this gameplay structure isn't fun. It's also so dark and void of any color that I tend to get sleepy after 30 minutes. I know it's supposed to be, but with practically no suspense or threat even when caught, I find myself not caring. You can billyjack anyone upside the head and easily dodge sword swings if caught.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterianna/recommended/239160/","masterianna","The Master","http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterianna/","46 products in account","Brief version.\n- Upsides: Awesome atmosphere, good narrative style, nicely written sidemission, somewhat satisfying main plot.\n- Downsides in a word: Gameplay. It isn't too bad, but it's so clearly flawed that it sometimes ruins the upsides.\n- Evaluation: 6/10.\n\nLonger version:\nI played Thief's games a long time ago, and this pseudo-reboot/follow-up/whatever-it-is isn't anything close to the originals. Honestly, just the drop from 90+ metacritic score to 70 says something about a very wide gap, and that gap is real (and even bigger than 20 points out of 100).\nSo why the hell do I recommend this game? Because it's still a decent game, and it provides for good entertainment. It is a 6/10 game coming from a 9/10 and 10/10 series, so if you played the previous Thief's titles be warned: you'll be disappointed, mainly by gameplay mechanics. I'll start with the bad to end with the ok.\n\nWhat is wrong about gameplay?\n- Sounds: you can hear YOUR footsteps even when you stay still and turn around (wtf!) but you can't hear a GUARD's footsteps if he's around a corner more than 2/3 meters away. Bad. Plus, into the houses you just hear very loud random footsteps/conversations from the other floors of the building (which you can't access). This this could be very cool if played right, but it becomes annoying since it's too frequent, and the people in the city seems like a bunch of sleep-walkers.\n- Random dialogues: while missions and main plot dialogues are satisfying to my taste, you keep overhearing like 6-7 exchanges over and over again while you roam the city, all from the same voices. Are those guys following you? Also, there is a chance that you overhear something useful, pointing you at thieving objectives like sub-sub-plots: cool... except it happened only 2 times in the whole game... meh...\n- Stealth is often awkward, mainly for two reasons: sight and sound (again). Sight - you are hidden in the shadows or you are not. In the first event, guards may also walk close to you - too close - they then look your way and they... don't detect you. What? Not very realistic, not in a *realistic* stealth game. In the second event they may see you just right and from afar: it's ok, but isn't there any middle-ground? - Sound - surfaces almost do not matter unless it's glass: you crouch if you want to move silently or you stand to move faster, except on carpets where you can move faster and still be silent: that was so cool when pace of movent and sound were so important, in previous Thief's installments, but now they introduced the swoop: if you want to move fast then just stay crouched and *swoop* around. Noise/speed trade-off doesn't exist anymore.\n- Swoop: sounds cool to me, and it really makes you feel a shadowy thief with great skill, but it's just too much prone to abuse. You want to go around faster? Swoop. You want to reach the back of a guard without alerting him when you WOULD alert him if you walked? Swoop. It's so abusable that it seems like a cheat rather than the cool tool it is supposed to be.\n- Footprints: they made you leave footprints in a 2002 game (if I remember the year right), now in 2014 you randomly walk into oil, pools of blood and such and do not leave any trail, not even for a few steps. Are you kidding me? That was very disappointing.\n\nAI is ok. Despite the many critics to that, I find the AI consistent enough, if you purge its behaviour from the effects of what's above. Only thing is: you are in a house with only 3 guards, you knock out the patrolling one: good. Wouldn't the other two notice he's missing, after a while? If so the game *realism* would have been so improved... but whatever.\n\nLet's get to the upsides!\n- Voice acting: some hardcore fans make themselves disgusted by the voice acting because it's different from how it was before. Why? Get over it, dudes, this one is good and well done.\n- Story: it's not a story of overwhelmingly epic proportions, but it's very good and entertainig. Moreover it's very well-balanced between thieving, discovering things (you won't understand half of what's happening unless you search for the documents and read them), supernatural activity, crowd madness when they revolt... a good story, well written too.\n- Atmosphere: awesome and very well designed, could only be better with less random-dialogues (see above) and more dialogues giving some insights on the city life. But grafically it's very good.\n- Overall feeling: if you are able to get over the downsides, Thief leaves a lasting feeling of... playing a dark gothic, almost satisfying stealth game, and that's why I recommend it.\n- Interface design: people complains a lot about it, and I wonder why. Focus makes the game like 100 times easier? Map indicators disturbs you and prevent you from feeling the exploration/orientation stuff you want? Frigging DISABLE it. I played with everything disabled and I like it, but there are many players too used to mmorpg (lost without map indicators) and some players who play to have a good time without having to pay too much attention (they are welcome to use focus). Who care? Let people play the game the way they want. Customizable difficulty/helpers are a BIG upside to this game IMO.\n\nLast thing worth mentioning, not related to the game but to its development. Many of the flaws above were highlighted during early beta stages by fans screaming in anguish. Why didn't the developers listen to the often good advise? Did they WANT to make a mediocre game? That I cannot understand but it isn't a reason to hate the game, rather to despise the developers' hybris.","July 26, 2014","true","29.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Main storyline is quite short and relies on you screwing up and replaying to give length to the game.  The rope arrow mechanic appeared to be lifted from Tomb Raider in terms of appearance.  Also some sound effects such as the threat/beginning of being detected I'm fairly certain were lifted from Dishonored - or at least very similar.  The bow seems very weak even when upgraded and the story is pretty much misery from start to finish leaving a somewhat "well that was all pointless" taste in your mouth.\n\nI think there is more content to the game than I witnessed but it would require a completionist attitude to appreciate it.

Not as good as Deus Ex, not as bad as Call of Duty.\n\n+ Customizable difficulty to recapture the feel of previous Thief games.\n\n+ The insane asylum is extremely creepy, continuing the tradition of atmospheric scares from Thief: The Dark Project's Return to the Cathedral and Thief: Deadly Shadows' Robbing the Cradle missions.\n\n- Every cultural thing you loved about the original Thief series is gone or lampshaded. There's a single conversation between two guards about the word "taffer", and Chapter 7 has you exploring the ruins of an old cathedral where the symbols bears striking similarity to the Hammerite and Mechanist symbols. That's it.\n\n- Rope arrows are more like puzzle mechanics than actual rope arrows from the original series. They cost 600 gold apiece (at Master difficulty), can only be fired at specific hanging posts, and cannot be collected again once fired.\n\n- There's no dedicated jump button. The spacebar will allow you to swoop (think: stealth roll in Skyrim), mantle up ledges, and climb ladders and ropes, but there is no jump button. Case in point: One of the final Basso side jobs has you breaking into an aparment. Said apartment has a window out on a ledge that is two feet away from the ledge you are currently on, and would be an easy task to get to IF THE GAME HAD A JUMP BUTTON. Instead, the mission forces you to go around to the side and waste 600 gold on a rope arrow to get in.\n\n- Boss battles.\n\n- BLOODY SCREEN SO REAL when your health is low.\n\n- The windows. There are a few windows that you can open, and when you start the opening animation you are either A) given a quicktime event where you mash E for no apparent reason, or B) don't have to do a quicktime event since it's a level transition. The problem is, the game never tells you which one is which until it's too late, the minimap and map have no level transition markers. And you cant just exit out of the quicktime event, you need to go through the entire motion of the animation.\n\n- Placement of the guards means that you are going to have to exploit dumb AI and game mechanics if you want to get a Ghost rating. Similarly, it is virtually impossible to play it Lytha style (no detections, no evidence, no knockouts, you were never there).\n\n\nIn short, save your money and just buy Dishonored. It's a much better Thief game than Thief. Alternatively, go buy the original Thief trilogy from GOG.","August 6, 2015","false","37.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Omnisegaming/recommended/239160/","Omnisegaming","Omnise","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Omnisegaming/","86 products in account","TL;DR\nThe gameplay is meh, watered down for beginners and there's not much to do about that. Higher difficulties can't change it. Difficulty changes, not the bad game design. Fighting is really meh, sneaking is pretty okay.\nVisuals are disgusting and monotonous, doesn't do a depressing and brooding mood justice.\nStory is convoluted but more importantly stupid and the characters are uninteresting and bland.\n\nI would recommend it, but there's so many better options, including the original game this is based off of.\nTry Dishonored for a much better designed levels and more interesting, properly told story with unique visuals and setting.\nTry Mark of the Ninja for probably one of the best true stealth games out there, though it is 2D.\nTry Metal Gear Solid, besides just in general, it's usually considered what ultimately popularized the stealth genre.\n\n\n\n\nCompared to the original, this new version is simplified and dumbed everything down, makes everything feel too slow paced (for me at least) and mediocre, almost insultingly so.\nIt lacks new variety or creativity in change, and while the bow n' arrows are nice, they are very situational (ex. rope arrows can only be in extremely specific spots). Focus mechanic is very meh, it is the "here's what you have to do" button, doesn't speed things up or add anything, it just makes it more boring. The visuals don't scream originality, and are dark, depressing and brooding. Which would normally be fine, but it's boring and dreary to see the exact same visuals among the exact same environment with the exact same tone and feeling, it's just monotonous. Monotonous, no matter how you can justify it being so, is boring and not interesting.\n\n\nThe story, and I'll mention I did in fact beat the game many times over, doesn't make any sense and isn't interesting at all for me to even consider looking deeper. The beginning leaves me wanting less, so I can just get to the gameplay. I suppose it's my fault for not exploring every monotonous nook and disintresting cranny to find the extra reads (like newspapers and notes), but I should at least have a basic idea of what's happening playing through once.\nI'll give a short summary of the intro:\n- You sneak around an' steal stuff, while some monologue goes on.\n- You meet up with a thief chick.\n- She's super obnoxious, in the same sense as a rebellious teenage girl going through her period.\n- Your character attempts to put morals on her but has some sort of dilemma of being hypocritical or whatever. (You know, killing or not killing)\n- Some walking happens, you steal a thing.\n- She wants to do a dangerous thing, stealing a thing from a cult thing, you show her the stolen thing you stole, she gets ♥♥♥♥♥♥, said thing flies on top of glass to place where cult thing is, she falls, gets into the cult ritual light thing, you save her but see the light or something, your eye turns blue (which is the excuse for the focus ability) and then NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU'RE IN A CARRIAGE GETTING CARRIED INTO THE CITY BUT THEN THE DUDES RUN PAST GUARDS WHEN THEY CLEARLY DIDN'T HAVE TO, GET SHOT, AND YOU WALK OUT LIKE "WTF" AND THEN THE FIRST LEVEL BEGINS WHAT IS THIS GAME\n\nehem, continuing.\n\nYour protagonist speaks, which is fine, Bioshock Infinite did it very well among some others. But the character you play as is not interesting and not inquisitive (which makes understanding the plot and setting inconvenient), and he reminds me of that ONE GUY that acts like the "lone wolf". He is so altruistic yet apprehensive that it makes me wonder if he even has a personality or if words just happen to come out of his mouth on occasion. Also, his dialogue is god awful, actually dialouge in general is pretty sketchy.\n\nSo, you meet up with a dude who thought you have been dead the last to years and is quickly established as a friend. He's like "woah ur ded" and you're like "wow yeah totally I'm not though lol" and he's like "okay" and then you're like "Okay now give me jobs so this game can have side-quests".\nThere's also an old lady who can upgrade the focus ability but it's not really explained why she can do that and again she has awful dialouge. It's a bit different, but there's little back and forth anyways.\n\nIf you read this far, congratulations.\n\nHave a nice day.","February 13","false","71.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","1"

I was truly expecting so much more and I was left disappointed.  I watched some videos of game play and foolishly decided too quickly that this game was something incredible.  That was my mistake, and I'm simply writing a review to hopefully prevent someone else from making the same mistake.\n\nThe storyline had promise, but it was very poorly put together and very difficult to follow.  This continues until the very end of the game and you're left feeling as though nothing was resolved.  By the end of the game the only thing accomplished is stopping Orion from turning everyone into monsters and saving Erin. ‘Nothing’ in the city changes. Gloom is still running rampant, people are still dying, the city is still corrupt and now it has no leaders...\n\nThe side missions are a catastrophe.  They are bland and unrewarding.  You simply enter the location steal an object and your mission is complete.  There is never anyone inside the house to challenge your sneaking skills or anything at all.  You don't even have to deliver the object after you've stolen it.    You simply get a tiny description on the mission and that's it.\n\nThe full map and mini map are extremely lacking with barely any detail put into them whatsoever.  Certain areas of the city are mission locked and the areas that you can explore never change. It's a very boring and bland place to explore.  All of the accessible ‘houses’ are rundown and every room looks practically the same. Really, you don’t get to explore houses as 90% of the house is always off limits and no one is ever inside either.  I also hate how you can't fast travel.  That is extremely annoying, especially when everything about the 'free roaming area' of the city is repetitive.\n\nThe population of the city consists of possibly at most four generic AI faces.  There are never any events in the city other than the occasional hanging which consists of a crowd between three and four people.  The city doesn’t feel real at all.  Gossip between AI’s never change either even if you’ve stolen the loot they’re discussing they just keep looping forever.  They even follow the same path after the events of chapter six when their city is on fire burning around them! They don’t react AT ALL.\n\nThere are so many features that could have been implemented into this game that would make it incredible.  But, aside from stunning visuals of the game it really has nothing else to offer.","May 8, 2014","false","9.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/recommended/239160/","badwhippet","Moonwind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/","568 products in account","This  game released in a ton of negative press: reviews were in the "it's okay, perhaps quite good" realm of 7/10; fans of the series were ANGRY (some of it justifiable); the story was absolutely appalling; there were many questionable design decisions such as quick-time events (QTE's), action scenes and even two boss fights that were heavily criticised.\n\nThe bad\nThe story really IS a mess! The sequel became SO overdue that all the work done on early Thief 4 was useless (it took 10 years to release a sequel). Instead of starting over with a reboot, the early sequel scraps were glued together as best they could, and the game renamed from "Thi4f" (its working-title) to, simply, "Thief" and marketed as a reboot instead. Trouble is: the story appears to begin by picking up where Thief 3 left off (a young girl taken under Garrett's wing to learn the art of thievery), the protagonist is still called Garrett, but all the old factions that gave the early titles such atmosphere and lore were gone and the events are set some 800 years later! None of it makes sense. Worse, what the game does obviously well it never finishes: there are some excellent NPC characters you'll meet, but their story goes absolutely nowhere, and side missions often lead to nothing. The Queen of Beggars for example. You'll meet her and she's set up to play some unknown yet significant part in the game - yet she is then not used any further beyond a scripted trade point for skill power-ups.\n\nThe QTEs have no real place in the game, though aren't quite as bad as was feared from previews of the game (a lot were stripped out after the preview backlash). Garrett's inability to jump where he might fall is annoying and removes all challenge from his parkour elements (plus can lead to him getting stuck behind barrels and boxes). And the cardinal sin: points of no return are rife - something that has NO place in a game built around finding collectibles! There are loads of side quests, many of them done well, but too many are all about sneaking into an empty room to steal something (no point beyond finding how to access the room - and people are just oddly missing when it's supposed to be the earliest hours after midnight). To make this more of a challenge, Garrett can no longer fire rope arrows just anywhere, and this upset a lot of players though I can appreciate why it was done (quite frankly there would be zero point to the side missions otherwise). So much else was criticised (such as the original voice for Garrett not being used - flimsy excuse provided, masses of loading sequences just to access an additional room or two, terrible and as yet unfixed audio problems and broken NPCs) that it's a wonder it scored anything at all!\n\nThe good Despite all, the game is hugely atmospheric with gorgeous graphics and the stealth play is brilliantly done (the best of all the Thief titles). While the story is linear (and disjointed, often pointless), the locations are mostly of a good size and, like Dishonored, offer many points of access. Stealing is done really well, with the whole scene animated beautifully with Garret's arm reaching out tentatively, then whipping up the chosen object and concealing it (ie object doesn't just vanish in thin air). The scare chapter IS genuinely scary and very hard to get through for people who aren't seasoned horror fans, though opinions are divided on whether this is scarier than the Shalebridge Cradle in Thief Deadly Shadows (having played both games quite close to each other, I personally found Thief 2014's asylum more frightening). While there are those unforgivable points of no return, any mission can be replayed in any order just by walking to its 'access gate'. The controls are intuitive and gameplay is genuinely enjoyable. The Bank Heist DLC integrates well and is worth the extra for an additional couple of hours of stealth entertainment. I suspect that, if Square Enix had made more of an effort with the plot instead of rushing out the mess of bolted-together unfinished stories they released, it would have been more deserving of its Thief pedigree. I actually pre-ordered the game (doh!) but despite all the bad, I don't regret it and have replayed the game a couple of times since release.\n\nIn summaryBad design decisions and broken plot with a muddle of reboot versus sequel marred the release of Thief 2014, yet underneath is a game that is genuinely entertaining and atmospheric with great gameplay mechanics.","April 13, 2015","true","217.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cs310/recommended/239160/","cs310","Spoof","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cs310/","84 products in account","TL;DR: Not a successor to the Thief-Franchise but (except for the story) a damn good stealth-game on its own.\n\n\nAs you might imagine, I do not have much experience with the Thief franchise, due to me being of very young age. I wasn't even born when the first Thief was released. However, I do have experience with stealth-games in general, and I hope to bring you a detailed insight of Thief 2014 and answer your question if you should buy it or not.\n\nSTORY\nThe Story begins with Garrett robbing a Safe for an expensive necklace. After he escapes the attic he found the safe in, he meets his friend Erin, who leads Garrett through a kind-of-tutorial-area. At the end of the mission, the two observe a group of people who look like priests or monks performing a ritual in front of something called the 'Primal Stone'. The Building Collapses, Erin falls down and dies, Garrett falls down, survives, but falls unconscious.\nA Year later, Garrett wakes up while two beggars try to smuggle his body into his hideout in the clocktower in the center of the city. The smuggling attempt fails, one beggar is killed, the other runs away and Garrett is on his own, with the claw he "inherited" from Erin. He later learns that the main antagonist is still alive, and that a plague-like disease, the "Gloom" is running about in the city.\nGarrett now works for several sides, his fence Basso, Orion, the leader of the resistance, and as a freelance to discover the secret behind his hallucinations of Erin in some kind of otherworld.\n\nHUBWORLD / THIEVERY\nIn the Hubworld you can take side-missions or go and heist houses at your own leisure. There's loot everywhere and some guards even carry little valuables on their belt, which you can either take by taking up their body after you killed / knocked them unconscious, or you can pickpocket the loot from them. There are also merchants who sell you various types of arrows, and quest-givers, who... well... give quests.\n\nMOVEMENT\nGarrett moves at a medium pace, and you can hold CTRL to walk over glass shards or through water quietly, or you can sprint by holding shift.\nWhile you cannot jump in place anymore, Spacebar has turned into one button for a little dash which you can use as a crouched sprint, and you can sprint with shift and hold spacebar to turn it into an automatic climbing button.\n\nCOMBAT: Blackjack\nGarrett carries a bow and a blackjack, but not a sword anymore.\nAlso, you can't equip the blackjack anymore, but swing it directly. Further, there's a dodge-button which helps you in combat. 3 Hits with the Blackjack while evading enemy hits will usually trigger an optional button to instantly knock out the guard. Without the Bow, you can NOT kill or civilians anymore.\n\nTHE BOW\nThe Bow is your all-purpose-weapon. You can shoot regular arrows to snipe enemies, water arrows to extinguish light sources, gas arrows to knock out birds, dogs and other potential troublemakers, and blunt-headed arrows which you can carry in great amounts to trigger buttons from afar.\nOne VERY big flaw for me is that you can shoot rope arrows only at pre-determined locations now, instead of wood in general. This eliminates the whole purpose of using a rope to climb unclimbable terrain. Now it's REQUIRED to reach certain locations, and the feeling of "being smarter than the game" which you had in the old Thief games is now gone.\n\nMISSION DESIGN\nThe side jobs are manifestations of the thief formula: go to x, steal y and, sometimes, bring it to z. For every side mission you receive a small amount of gold, sometimes a few hundred, sometimes the reward is a piece of loot that's worth 50 gold.\nOne problem is the amount of side missions there are in the game. If you do them all, you will never face financial problems and be able to buy everything, at least below master difficulty. In the Master difficulty grade, arrows and gadgets are considerably harder to come by, and at some point you will have to decide what type of arrows you want.\n\nThe Story Missions are horribly designed. Sometimes the game crosses Horror territory,\nWALKING THROUGH AN ASYLUM WITH NO ENEMIES AROUND AND PICKING RANDOM LOCKS TO TRIGGER STORY PROGRESS DOES NOT BELONG IN A STEALTH-GAME.\nSometimes it throws you into a room with 4 or more enemies, aware of your presence, and with the objective set near an un-extinguishable lightsource, forcing you to kill or knock out everyone around.\n\nGRAPHICS, PERFORMANCE\nThe game runs buttery smooth on my Phenom II X4 965 BE and Radeon HD 7850, without AA and V-Sync. Shadows look great even on medium settings and the textures reach from okay to sexual intercourse for the eye.\n\nPERFORMANCE OPTIONS\nThe list is too extensive to describe in in detail here, but I will give you an example:\nImagine the settings "Graphic quality: Low/Medium/High"\nThief's graphic settings are the opposite of that.\nAlso: FOV goes up to 110°.\n\nGAMEPLAY SETTINGS / DIFFICULTY SETTINGS\nYou can create a custom game-mode with special limitations. There are many options, from "you can't use broadhead and sawtooth arrows" to "if you die your savegame is deleted". All of these options increase the score you get in the game, which is shared on a global leaderboard, if you choose so.\n\n\nOverall, Thief is a nice game. The thievery and movement feels right, and aside from some really ♥♥♥♥ed up main missions, it's a blast to play. I bought it in a bundle for 9€ and holy ♥♥♥♥, this game for 9€? Worth every penny.\nThief 2014, Thief 4, Thief Reboot, Thief Remastered, Thief whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you'd like to call it, is dragged down by comparisons to the older Thief titles, which were better than this game. This does not mean that this game is bad, though.","May 1, 2015","true","17.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PixelDo/recommended/239160/","PixelDo","PixelDo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PixelDo/","181 products in account","So I got thief on a special deal and decided, before i play it, to play Thief Gold. Thief Gold is the original and features many great things. It has a range of arrows that the player can use to do a lot of things from putting out torches to causing distractions on the other side of the room. It is older than me so my hopes were not that high but it is still a very challenging game.\nBut anyway, to the game in question. The first thing I noticed was the fantastic PC port. I was not expecting this but you can change almost everything including controls, audio, graphics etc. Jumping into the game I found myself in a world of grim beauty. The artwork creates a very good atmosphere along with the eary music that keeps you on edge.\n\nThose are all nice things but after completing a couple missions I realised the city/hub world was an "always on". The guards will always want to kill you and that makes getting around to the shops quite annoying. I read some reviews of people saying they liked this as it was good for practising but I found it more of a nuisance. Another unneeded nuisance is that, as far as I know, the only way to increase arrow holding capacity is to buy three extra DLCs all 79p each. It seems cheap but I do not want to pay money for something they could neatly add as the player gains more focus points. That leads me on to the skill points in thief called focus points. They are gained from completing certain missions and by paying in game gold to "The Queen of Beggars" for an ever increasing price. This is fine. I am perfectly happy with the gaining of focus points but not so happy with the usage. The skill "Trees", even though they are barely branches, consist of two perks; one will read something along the lines of "Slightly encrease your ability to..." the second one will be along the lines of "Majorly encrease your ability to...". I do not see a point in having them if they barely do anything. Even the first branch gets given a point already allocated to it before you get given an open map, leaving one space left for upgrade that early on in the game.\n\nThe puzzles were another thing that stood out to me. They all seemed so forced like a cry of attension reminding everyone you bought a game with more than stealth. THey never really fit into place and delay the proper gameplay.\n\nAt the end of each level you are "rewarded" for how you played. I say "Rewarded" because I have yet to see what it does besides XP. The three wins you can get are Opportunist, Predator and Ghost. I put them in order of how good it feels to get them, Opportunist being last. Opportunist is where you steal a lot of things and put out the most light sources but doesn't feel as rewarding as the others. In the first mission it teels the that the main character, Garrett, is against killing people then lets you get rewarded for killing as many people as possible. The game should strive towards making people want Ghost or Opportunist, not just Ghost.\n\nAnother thing that made me want to steal less was the fact houses had around 2 things to loot in them and some even had really oddly placed traps that make their houses unsusable and just dumb thief killing machines.\n\nThe combat was actually quite clever. In the original you were given a sword and blackjack, but in this game you do not get a sword. This makes people want to do more stealth than if they could just complete the game with stabing everyone under the sun. The blackjack is still used for takedowns ,although in an animation format instead a 'Click to hit' way, but you can press 'r' (by default) to hit with your blackjack. One verse one battles are easy enough with correct dodging along with one verse two battles, but any more and you are certain to loose life.\n\nOverall Thief was still a good game, it has an immaculate stealth system and an atmosphere that keeps you on edge with the chance of guards always being around the corner. I will compare it to the original and say it clung to it like it should. So I will give this game 7/10 as it seems completely finished just could be better in all the above stated reasons. :3","March 12, 2014","true","28.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StrappingYoungNero/recommended/239160/","StrappingYoungNero","The Plug","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StrappingYoungNero/","213 products in account","For a game trying so hard to be Dishonored, you'd think it take some of the things people liked about Dishonored. The level design was the standout part of Dishonored, with open, expansive levels with plenty of paths and secrets. At first glance, Thief's levels look like they have a taken a page from the same playbook Dishonored copy-pasted from, but once you explore a little, you'll realize that there is never more than two paths on each level. There is a level where you have to sneak into a mansion. There were two obvious paths into the mansion: one through the front door, surrounded by about six guards with the intelligence of a Michael Bay fan; and another path leading to a vent, which was completely unguarded. I first went through the vent but, upon realizing that the vent just put me behind the front door, I reloaded and played the other path.\nAnother bonus of Dishonored were the abilities, each of which had their own use for exploring the levels. Thief's abilities are almost all boring passives, that I didn't upgrade at all after the initial level. Thief's abilities have no use in the levels, they open no new paths. There is almost no point to stealing things after the first few levels, as once you have the wrench and the wirecutters, the upgrades are almost completely useless. The focus is lifted right out of Hitman: Absolution because originality is hard.\nThe game pretends to encourage different playstyles but anything other than pure stealth is completely unreasonable. The only way to kill guards is the bow and all of the lethal arrows are absurdly expensive. I'm alright with a game being a stealth game, Square Enix, you don't need to cater to the ritalin popping droolers who get bored when their fellow man isn't being exterminated at a rapid pace.

As a long time Thief fan this just does not feel like Theif at all and even as a stealth game its not really that good either. From the boring level design to the audio engine which pales in comparison to Thief: Deadly Shadows, and the inconsistant A.I. its just a shame to see one of my favourite franchises hit this kind of low.\n\nThe story is like something out of a childs book and isnt very interesting and it doesnt do a good job of making you feel as if you are somewhere you are not meant to be unlike earlier Thief games, in this you just feel like an everyday petty thief.\n\nThough I have only played 4 hours of it so far I just cant bring myself to play in long stretches unlike the previous games were they had me glued to my screen.\n\nAs of now its a no but if it gets any better the further it goes in then I will change my review.","July 18, 2014","false","4.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

This game is nigh unplayable. The movement is clunky and edge recognition is always stuttering. The polish and production values decline the longer you play it. The camera and POV rocks like a shaky-cam opperator with inner ear troubles. The game is not at all optimized graphically or for the mouse and keyboard. The plot is childish. I can accomplish the "stealth" part of the game by mashing space to zip from place to place, but the stealth and the mobility of this game are atrocious. The characters are questionably illustrated through the worst exposition I've ever seen, while the dialogue is worse than a B-movie. etc. etc. I have forced myself to try to play it over and over and over again but I can barely get one checkpoint accomplished before leaving it or uninstalling it, promising never to try to finish it.\n\nI bought it on the pre-order because I really wanted it to turn out well, but it failed miserably - this was arguably the worst purchase I have ever made. If it were more like Dishonored but with a more tactical element and focused on long range engagement with a bow rather than emphasis on hand to hand combat and a diminuative crossbow, I would have loved it. As it stands, do not waste your money on this game.

But Thief 4 was such a horrible dissapointment that I felt the need to write a review for the first time, and warn others. If you have any love for the old Thief games I suggest you avoid this like the plague. The game felt as if they had removed everything that I liked about the series with surgical precision. The game reminded me of Call of Duty way too often in it's casual, linear and clichéd way. Dishonored and Amnesia: dark descent gave me more "nostalgic thief feeling" than this game did.\n\nI miss the freedom to explore, I miss the little details that made the game-world come alive for me in the old games, I don't like the cutscenes and I don't like the way Garret's character changed (or should I say "was removed", because what's left of him is so generic and lame that the old and the new Garret have little more in common than their name). I even preferred the sounddesign and ambiance in the old games. It just felt more real and the musical action cues in Thief 4 seem so out of place. When I take down an enemy with the blackjack I don't need to hear the music freak out every... single... time.... It breaks immersion more than it helps in my opinion.\n\nI have been playing the old Thief 1 when I got too frustrated with the newest installment of the series and I have to say I just have more fun with it. The gameplay is way better and more rewarding in my opinion. All the added mechanics in Thief 4 just make it feel more artificial and contrived to me. Never did I have the feeling of being in a world that I could explore or that any of my decisions mattered. Also Thief 1 on the easiest setting is in my opinion for the most part harder than Thief 4 on hardest setting. One bossfight in Thief 4 was incredibly unfair and hard though, to the point where it felt like a bad joke. I don't judge Thief 1 and 2 just from nostalgic memory, I still play such games to this day. I just picked up where I left my second playthrough of Thief 1 and I played Thief 2 again just a few years ago.\n\nI give the game credit though for coming up with what I think might be the most cliché and cheezy bad guy character that I have ever seen. From the name, to his appearance and dialogue this is pure B-Movie trash and I said out loud "are you kidding me?" multiple times throughout the game.\n\nIf you have not played Dishonored yet you should buy that. It really is better in every conceivable way! If you liked the old Thief games, chances are you will hate this one as much as I do. I don't know whom I could recommend this to. I wouldn't even play it only for the stories sake, because it's just as bad as everything else.\nUnlike other old franchises like Tomb Raider and Deus Ex that recently got very decent new titles added to their legacy, this one should have better stayed in the shadows...\n\n\nTL;DR\nwow, such b*llsh*t, very disappoint!\n\nP.S.: It says I played for ~17 hours, that's thankfully not the case. The game was more like 12-13 hours including retries, the other time I had alt-tabbed and it kept tracking.","August 10, 2014","false","17.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Which is probably the best thing you can do. This is the first thief game I've played seriously. From my understanding all the thief games have a certain level of mysticism.\n\nTraversal - I think the open “city” bits are extremely small and overly designed. It doesn't feel like I'm traversing a living city. Cutting through the same windows to steal things from houses that in addition to barely ever having people inside don't feel like houses I had a choice in entering or not. Absolutely everything in the city feels contrived and convoluted. This game would have greatly benefited from a more organic feeling of being nimble and clever during traversal.\n\nMechanics and narrative – Think Skyrim but only the thieves guild and without a decent combat system. Just a mediocre one. And zero to no character customization. Its got your sneak walk, its got dashing, its got takedowns and a wide variety of arrows for specific situations. Its a stealth game. However very little of the time do you ever need to use them. The AI is awful. Aside from technical glitches where upon loading in area NPC's, they were stuck in the T-pose. You can circumvent the AI very easily. And checkpoints are virtually everywhere.\n\nThe storyline isn't... uninteresting.. its just kind of boring to a degree. At one point I felt like. “Yes, I'm aware this building is burning down but I really need to steal all this cutlery” It wasn't uninteresting to watch unfold it just felt like felt separate from my own desire to steal all the spoons in the city. And to the games credit in Chapter 5. Despite feeling like I, myself was the shadows previously. I truly felt like I was being hunted in this chapter. Definitely my favorite chapter story wise. It pretty much can be summed up with “I believe myself to be a Honorable thief, my girlfriend who is also a thief is doing something I believe is dishonorable. My arrogance got her killed but I can't remember exactly what happened. Magic turns out to be real and my girlfriend is not dead. Girlfriend is bitter and feels betrayed. Use magic to stop her from being crazy meanwhile the city is filled with death and disease and a new religion is born by a false prophet.\n\nPersonally I like being a sneaky rogue type in games. I like duping, tricking and outsmarting people however you only really get decent satisfaction from disarming the traps or picking a lock successfully while the guy on patrol is walking toward you. Only when he arrives at the door, its closed and you're on the other side.","February 12, 2015","true","19.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

To anyone. Do I regret playing it? Not exactly; some parts of the game were fun and enjoyable. But on a whole, I could have spent that time on a better, more worthwhile game. Dishonored and the original Thief games come to mind, and I've heard good things about Deus Ex. I have a few main reasons for disliking it this game: bad gameplay, poor level design, and low quality writing.\n\nGameplay\n\nI found the gameplay to be severely underdeveloped, counter-intuitive, and choppy. There is no "lean" control as there is in Dishonored and Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Not only can you not perform this simple motion wherever and whenever you like in Thief, but if you're going to look around a corner you have to approach the corner and press E. Which is the action button for everything. So while you are searching a desk, you may find that Garrett gets in one of his jumpy moods and suddenly huddles behind it, peeking cautiously around the corner at...nothing. All because this feature was poorly designed. Also, counter-intuitive actions. You hold E to peek through a keyhole and press right-mouse to stop? Who thought of that awful idea? It makes sense to me that you press one button to start an action and the same button to stop it.\n\nAlso, whose idea was it to have the player spend gold on upgrades that make a task harder? I spent some good money on upgrading Dexterity. Does the upgrade make lockpicking easier? NO. It is more tedious, it takes longer, and it uses Focus. Bad, bad idea.\n\nLevel Design\n\nOn several occasions while I played the game, I found myself unclear on what I was supposed to be doing and how I was supposed to do it. The tasks and how to accomplish them just weren't always clear, and it's not because I'm an inexperienced gamer or don't know what I'm doing, it's because the level and the sequence of events/objectives was not thoroughly developed.\n\nAlso, was anyone else frustrated by an apparent inability to use rich text in the documents? It's really not that hard, guys. Couldn't you just write an italicized word like this rather than *like this*? Nothing interferes with a game's immersion like seeing that kind of notation to remind you that you're not, in fact, a thief in The City during a time period similar to the 19th century; you are in fact in the 21st century, playing a disappointing game.\n\nA note on graphics: it was excessive. I turned all of the settings all the way down on my computer, and it still crashed a good 20 times or so. I've played games with great graphics on my computer (all 3 Bioshock games, Portal 2, The Talos Principle, etc) that never made it crash; Thief could have easily been a good-looking game that didn't have a seizure every hour or so.\n\nWriting\n\n...Do I even need to say much on this? So much drama. The dialogue was sub-par, and Erin is the most annoying, angst-filled teenage girl I've ever seen in a game. The story of the game just felt...dry.\n\nConclusion\n\nThief was a game that tried to be everything that Dishonored was, and fell miserably short. Dishonored benefited from a rich and immersive story, fluid and intuitive gameplay, and well-designed levels that gave the player options without confusing them; Thief had none of these in its favor. Eidos missed a great opportunity to make Thief into a fantastic reboot, and they could have done it if they had held themselves to a higher standard and taken the time to produce a quality game. Unfortunately, they didn't, and this is the result.","February 10","false","23.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","7","11","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deadmano/recommended/239160/","Deadmano","[AAO] Deadmano","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deadmano/","525 products in account","So it's been 30 hours so far, and even though I'm having such a blast, the collecting of EVERY SINGLE LOOT (OCD) is starting to get to me. I just had to get that out of the way, here and now! Surely Garret is content by now?! Moving on...\n\nThis reboot of the original Thief will not be suited to all, in fact I wouldn't be surprised if only 1 in 10 people actually will enjoy it, as the taste is a rather specialized one. If you are a diehard fan of the original series you may or may not enjoy this one, since while it still captures the essence behind Thief, the whole openworld experience is quite hampered with long loading times, awkwardly placed transitional zones and poor openworld map layout, other than that it is everything you could want from a Thief game!\n\nIf you're used to running around and killing everything without repercussions then I suggest you look elsewhere. As the original games, Thief is very unforgiving in all but stealth actions. And rightly so, for this is a fully stealth based game, and thieves are no match in combat. Thief, not Rogue, there is a difference. They're light footed, they get in and out, that's all there is to it.\n\nA lot of people seem to want to compare this game to Dishonoured, and while the two may share similarities I can honestly say from playing both that Thief is the one to go for a complete stealth experience and a very dark storyline whereas Dishonoured you can get away with pretty much anything you do, without a real challenge (unless you impose one on yourself).\n\nAll looting and thieving aside, Thief has one of those rare atmospheres that manages to draw you into the game world, and that is thanks to the talented developers at Square Enix, the driving force behind Deux Ex: Human Revolution which also had such an amazing atmosphere to get absorbed into. The story in itself is quite an interesting one, and later on towards the end the game starts taking a turn for the horror/paranormal reminiscence of Outlast which both terrified and excited me since at least in Thief you have a chance (emphasis on YOU, not me, as playing on Master difficulty with instant fail on taking damage/being seen is what I've condemned myself to).\n\nWhile the graphics in Thief never was an issue since it's such an old game, I can't help but feel that they limited themselves quite a bit by using the Unreal Engine (though I've seen much better looking games with the same engine). But to be honest, it's not about realism (though it does get that across), but about the dark noir/steampunk feel which goes hand in hand with its rugged graphics display. The audio is what really makes the game come to life though, with footsteps perfectly positioned and the rest of the sounds matched correctly more often than not you'll feel like you're really in the game until you're stuck humping a wall because it's not a predefined climb spot.\n\nTake all this and add the ability to start a custom difficulty game where YOU get to decide how the game will play out, if you can use healing items, if you are allowed to take damage or use specific items amongst many other modifiers makes for a completely unique experience tailored to your own playstyle! Think you're a Master Thief? Prove it!\n\nFor those who haven't played any of the Thief games and are looking for something new which doesn't heavily rely on combat (though it is available) a la Metal Gear Solid/Splinter Cell then I'm sure you'll find something of value in Thief.\n\nFor those of you who are Thief fans, or have played any of the older Thief games then for nostalgia sake you will enjoy being a Taffer once more, causing mayhem for the guards, racking up loot, finding the secrets and generally just being a badass.","March 5, 2014","true","49.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyPanther/recommended/239160/","CrazyPanther","Draconis Nox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyPanther/","954 products in account","I have about 50 hours playing this game, and I can safely say its not worth buying. It has next to no content, and very small/short missions that feel just like a panty raid more than a Thief game. The AI is so bad, they needed a quick load...and sometimes when you save, NPC's vanish or respawn, as well as items or objectives. So its flawed and very inconsistant. When you are done with the game itself, dont expect to do much. You waste more on a rope arrow to get to a "Secret room" then you will recieve from the loot.\n\nBad economy all together, which is a thing the "Other" Thief games had no problem with.\n\nNo one likes you. You dont really see many civilians to steal from like "Other" thief games. Youre going to be poor and everyone is going to try to kill you on sight for no reason.\n\nYou "sneak'' better standing up and running directly at an enemy than you do while actually trying to sneak. This game isnt very friendly to stealth unless you want to wait for days at a time for patrols to move. Even then, with backs turned and you in perfect darkness, they are more likely to see you than if you were in the light standing right next to them.\n\n-SPOILER HERE- (Also important if you care if the story is worth bothering with in Thief)\n\nThe story is non-exsistant. Its not about Garret at all, like "Other" Thief games that had mystery, suspense, and Garret stealing something bigger than he expected or breaking in for information or framing somone. You just dont do any of that here. The story is, without a doubt, boring and re-tar-dead (Steam censors that word for some reason...idiots...). Some annoying biznatch complains and whines to Garret for ten minutes in the beginning of the game, to which Garret is like "Yo, chill out and be a Thief not a Thug, hoe." and she is all like "No! Im a whiney pre-teen ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! Ill do what I want." So she dies. The end. Honestly that is the story. I kid you not. Like not until the end of the game do you even seem to care...and Im not even sure WHY you care. The girl is obviously a cu4t that no one in their right mind would give a rats azz about. The END.\n\n-END SPOILER-\n\nI kept trying to see "Thief" in this game, but the clumsy way you steal everything and how long it takes you to snag even one pouch from a guard is so...lets put it this way, in an MMO they call it a time sink. It just felt like everything took way too long to do. From aiming a bow, to stealing from a dresser, it added up to hours of completely wasted time. The "Other" Thief games never had that problem. Also, picking up bodies and tossing them. Compare to "Other" Thief games to see how bad the new game is. You could pick up a body over your shoulder and carry them to a safe place...quietly...it didnt take all day and didnt require you to stand in the perfect spot to be able to grab a guard and move them. Huge wastes of time.\n\nNo real sense of factions. So you have the city Guard and a bunch of painted punk rockers. No Hammerites, no Pagans, No Keepers. The game brings you to places that look like the RUINS of those factions, to which I get this idea that this game is trying to build on the older games foundations. BUt its more an insult, really. Dont expect anything youll want to really pay attention to.\n\nThe conversations are, at best, about fecal matter and urine. Then the occasional skintrade girl. No content or anything interesting, and everyone sounds like they are right next to yo which will confuse you in a so called stealth game. Bad sound, hardly any voice actors.\n\nUnconvincing Villans. A gimp that can mannage to get to the top of burning buildings (Thief-Taker General), over ravines, into deep caverns with only rail sized walk ways and ropes to climb on, can somehow always mannage to be ahead of Garret...amazing. And a Ghost that uses light to hurt Garret...*Face palm* ...I should say forces Garret into hiding while standing up in a shadow or "sneaking" as Thief would have you believe.\n\nI do not recommend this game. If it had about ten more chapters and about twenty more missions, I would probably have said its ok and told you to wait until it had a 80% discount. Youre going to waste your money in hopes that you find Thief 4, when you will find a game that feels like only about half of what it was intended to be, and cut short due to deadlines or the want to sell an unpollished turd.\n\nWhat else you will miss out on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K9VSRhgzE0&list=PL9F1B213CA942A8F0&index=21\n\nPlease notice there are cutscenes between EACH mission in all ofthe other Thief games. All of which tell a detailed story and explain Garret's progress as the master Thief, unlike Thief 4 which has no direct focus on Garret aside from the player being forced to hear through his ears about everyone around him.\n\nIn THIS Thief, you wont see monsters such as: Zombies, Giants Lizards, Rat Men, Fish Folk, Pagan Mutations, Tricksters, Rat People, Giant Spiders, Scarab Guardians, Golems, Witches, Demons, Gods, Pagans, Hammerites, Ghosts, Death Knights, Wizards, Mercinaries, Rival Thieves Guilds, Keepers, Mechanations, Abominations, Fire Orbs, ect ect ect...\n\nYou also wont see: Hidden tombs and ancient temples, mystical areas, forests, underground pathways, sewers built on top of the old city, ritual sites, anything interesting or new, ect ect ect...\n\nTo sum up Thief 4 and the reason EVERYONE says its ♥♥♥♥, is because it is a bland, lifeless pile of dog ♥♥♥♥ that has a lack luster approach, broken story that doesnt follow a visible path, characters that have no belivable reason to be in the places Garret discovers them, and nothing but the same old crap guards everyplace with nothing outside of the normal human in light armor, dogs, or caged chickens to see. It does NOT live up to the fine title of "Thief" in any way, and honestly should not have been allowed to keep the franchise name.\n\nIts basically like making Farmville and calling it Final Fantasy, then telling everyone its a remake and reimagined version of Final Fantasy. Its a lie, deceptive, and is a shameful rip-off for anyone attempting to find a continuation to the game.","March 4, 2014","false","71.4"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

(Review for those who haven't played the original)\n\nSO!!! Thief! Where to begin? Well let's start with the gameplay. Not going to like the stealth gameplay was really great! I haven't played too many stealth genre games but in my experience I enjoyed the mechanics and the way the game worked. The game also has a decent amount of content in it if you add in all the side missions along with achievements. One cool part is how the game has a custom difficulty setting where you can set certain things in the game. While some stealth games open the chance to do missions loudly (open combat) thief highly discourages it. The game has it set so that even if you want to kill/knockout foes rather than avoiding them you still have to be stealthy about it if you want to succeed. There are limited amounts of arrows that you can use to hit enemies so the best way is to sneak up behind them and knock them out. So an overview of the positives : Great stealth mechanics, Great game content, Custom settings for difficulty. While there were a good amount of pros to the game there were also cons. One of the major ones was the story. Very sloppily done if you ask me. The story was just so generic and seemed very uninteresting to me. It seemed like something a 5th grader could make in a literature class. So if you're really into story rich games NOT RECOMMENDED. Secondly the game is very unclear on how to jump down from ladders and ropes. This is a minor thing but left me frustrated until I looked up how to do it. Personally for me I did not like how there were so many mini cinematics in the game. Everytime you knock someone out from behind it plays a little action scene. You lose control of the character and this happens EVERY time you get someone from behind. This little sequence became very tedious and annoying the more I played the game. Lastly for the cons, the game in my mind didn't seem very fluid. The movement of the main character seemed somewhat jagged and not verry buttery. Overall the game is a cheap thrill. I Cannot in my right mind actually recommend anyone pay a full $30 for it. I got it through humblebundle at a reduced rate.

So anyway, I wanna throw out my thoughts on the game.\n\nFirst of all, I am a fan of the old thief games. They were the first stealth games I'd ever played and it was just great going around stealing things and not killing anyone for a change. I will be making comparisons with the old games, but keep in mind my memory might be hazy and blinded by nostalgia.\n\nOverall, I was neither deeply impressed nor disappointed in this reboot. It was alirght.\n\n\nThe Writing:\n\nThe overall story just wasn't very interesting to me. It has some plot twists, but they seem borrowed from Thief: The Dark Project in some way. I think the original Thief series had much better writing, from Garret's backstory, to the setting - the three factions Garret has to deal with, manipulating the fate of the world in various ways and Garret always getting into trouble with them, getting mixed up in some crazy plot. The whole steampunk technology versus supernatural elements the original series has going is just really awesome.\n\nWhile both the original series and the reboot's stories might be simplified to "A loner's journey through a society where powerful factions struggle for power", the new Thief just wasn't that interesting to me as the older games. I guess it's a matter of details.\n\nThat's not to say that there weren't some cool aspects to the writing/story. I did enjoy the mysterious gloomy atmosphere. There are also some spooky elements which I enjoyed. I did enjoy Garret himself as a character too.\n\n\nThe Gameplay:\n\nI found the new lockpicking mechanic enjoyable.\n\nThere's plenty of exploration and loot to find, lots of documents to read too which is really cool if you enjoy hunting around for backstory (in fact, some of the details you find in writing are a lot cooler than the main story itself).\n\nThe sneaking is also solid. The guards react properly to distractions, not just going towards where you threw something but also searching around and even coming after you if they saw where the projectile came from. They alert other guards too if they are too startled and then it gets really tough to escape if you're anywhere near them. They also relight fires if they see them go out, so you can't just water arrow everything and have an easy time sneakingi around.\n\nHowever, there are some unwelcomed changes and additions...\n\nFirst of all, the rope arrow - where before you could fire it into wooden surfaces, now you can only use it on predetermined spots. One might think that in both cases you're still only using the rope arrow where the developer intended. However, there's just no denning that the old rope arrow mechanics offered more freedom. Thus you feelt like the path you made through levels was your own, you could feel proud of your solutions.\n\nNow, instead of crafting your path through the level, it feels more like you're just oppening different kind of doors all the time. You want to get into a room and you start looking at your options: I can picklock the door, or disable some trapping mechanism so I can get through the window, or use the wrench to open the basement grating, or if I have a rope arrow I can unlock the path through the second story window.\n\nI'm not saying that navigating the levels isn't fun, but it just feels like these are all toggle switches. You do this to open your path. Yay. How exciting. After a while it just becomes routine.\n\nThen there's a couple of silly action sequences. I don't want to run around on rooftops being chased by what have you. I want to sneak around all the time and never get spotted. That's why I'm playing a Thief game and not Mirror's Edge. (Although even I have to admit, there is one action sequence which looked cool the first time I saw it - but that's about it. It still felt out of place in a Thief game.)\n\nThere are some stupid QTE mechanics too, though thankfuly not many. When oppening windows for some reason you have to mash the Use key. And when passing through narrow corridors you also have to mash the Use key. Why? What's the point of this? It doesn't make the game any more exciting, it doesn't add any level of challenge, it's just annoying. Even more annoying, there are sections where Window opening and Narrow corridor crawling are used to load new areas, and in these sections you don't have to mash the Use key - why couldn't they let you not mash the Use key in all the other times?!...\n\n\nWhile there are plenty of annoying things about the gameplay, luckily exploring around for loot, picking locks and avoding guards was entertaining enough for me.\n\n\nOther stuff:\n\nWhile I didn't play much of the challenge modes yet, I must say I do enjoy them a lot. In fact, they might be more enjoyable than the rest of the game.\n\nAlso, the custom difficulty options are really cool. It's really cool that they let you customize your experience like that. I played on a custom Master dificulty with penalties for killing or alerting anyone, and also with focus abilities disabled because I wanted to play a thief not some magic eyes wizzard.\n\nAnnoying Bugs I encountered:\n\nThe sound sometimes buggered out, people ending up saying the same linie twice at the same time. (Edit: I mean, an NPC would literally say the same thing "with two voices" with a 1-2 second delay in between the two.)\n\nQuicksaving seemed to bug out guard patrol routes sometimes.\n\nIn addition, the game sometimes started dropping frames like crazy, going down from my average of 40-60 fps to what felt like under 10 - just stuttering all the time until I restarted it. This seemed to happen in the hub world after loading too many new areas or something.\n\nConclusions:\n\nSo yea, overall I don't think it's anywhere near as good a game as the original thief games were in their time. Although, as I said, nostalgia might be clouding my memories. All things considered, while I did focus here more on the negative aspects of the game, it was still a solid experience for me - it wasn't as great as I hoped it would be, but not as disappointing as I feared it might be either.\n\nIf you haven't played a Thief game before but enjoy stealth, you might enjoy it. If you played the old Thief games, well, you might not think as much of it as a newcomer, but if you keep an open mind you might still find it enjoyable like I did.\n\nSo I guess I would recommend it, preferably at a discount. Unless the full price isn't that big of a deal for you.","March 10, 2014","true","95.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","3"

Remakes are always a dangerous thing I guess. Very often a remake is trying to be something completly new and so it is too far away from the original. On the other hand, if a remake does nothing new it does raise the question why you should make a remake if you did change nothing?\n\nThis review is probably not very positive and some people will probably say something like: Hey you just had wrong expectations!\n\nWhile I will say something about the whole expectations thing later, let us just look at the plain facts.\n\n\nLet us start with the most obvious thing, how does thief look? Well it does look pretty well if you ask me. Well of course it is not the most colorful game, but hey it is a about sneaking in a dark city with steampunk elements. Thief is actually pretty good at this task. The city does look nice and so I can clearly say that thief is a good looking game.\n\nHowever trouble is easy to find, or in that case easy to hear. The sound of the game is pretty much underwhelming in all aspects. While the voice actors are okay (not great and not terrible) I do miss the old voice actor of garret. However there is more trouble ahead. The entire soundscape is underwhelming and is often schockingly silent. The attempt at a dynamic music system ranges between annoying and broken and I have to say it has been a long time since I actually actively hated the ingame music of a game.\n\nWell sound and graphics are obviously not everything so what about the gameplay and the story? Sadly those two departments show the biggest flaws. Gameplay is pretty linear and often not very interesting, of course there are some alternative routes here or there but they are neither elegant or interesting. While you can roam around the city and do some sidemissions you always feel how limited your routes and by that your options are. It does not help that the enemy AI is pretty stupid and that the guards are awful at their job. So gameplay wise the game is pretty linear and not really challenging. Of course you can raise the difficult in the settings and customize a lot of things, but that does no really make the gameplay itself more interesting and fun.\n\nThe story of Thief is also sadly pretty boring and dull. Beside that it is full of logic holes. I dont expect a story to make 100% sense and of course there are things in a story that happen because the story must go somewhere. However a a story most have its own logic and if things stop making sense inside that logic, then you have problems getting engaged in a fictional story.\n\nSo much about a look about what I would call the facts. Thief is not a terrible game, I think games with a big budget can hardly be completly terrible, but just having a big budget mean you produce a ace game. Thief is far from being a ace game. I spoke about expectations earlier and this game wants to be a thief game. The problem is that in nearly no aspect it is one. It may sound a bit extreme but this game could have been released under a completly different title and some people would only call it a part time rip off of the original thief.\n\nCan I recommend this game? Well not really. This game claim to be something that is is not and beside that it is only a average game.","March 4, 2014","false","9.5"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Domarius/recommended/239160/","Domarius","Domarius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Domarius/","581 products in account","Screw you all - turn off ALL the helper settings (and I mean ALL, no exceptions) crank the difficulty RIGHT UP, and get immersed in the game.  This is a worthy successor. I feel like I'm lost in the world of Thief again, a feeling I haven't felt since Thief 1 and 2.  For the record I enjoyed Thief Deadly Shadows but it was fairly weak in comparison, and overall felt poorly made.\n\nThis one is oozing hard work and meticulous care at every turn and every crevasse - and I mean that.  The city is so full of nooks and crannys, I felt myself getting lost in the alleyways and staring at a doorway with a sign above, wondering what its like for that house or shop during the day.  The city is layered upon layers, of old buildings somehow impossibly built upon other old buildings and streets, in a fantastical dream-like way which still seems believable and gives me the impression that people actually live on these different levels.\n\nTo me, the AI is impressive yet fair.  No matter how good I get at the game, I cannot race through the city towards another side mission without stopping and taking time.  Even with the swoop mechanic (which I love by the way) moving fast will almost certainly cause some guard to turn their head at the moving shadow in the alleyway, go investigate, cause a fuss which will put others on alert, and your careless continued running will certainly be spotted - and you'll be chased.  This will likely end in your death, and best case, cause you a lot of lost time and potentially lost resources as you do what you can to escape and wait till the whole thing blows over.  Damn you, developers! I cannot carelessly exploit the AI as I could in the original game - I MUST take care and play like a proper thief!  (PS. that means they did their job.)\n\nAs for the artwork, story, dialogue etc. it has the same level of care, but I want to keep this review short.  Watching the dialogue between the effeminate (male!) brothel owner and the ThiefTaker General had me invested in the conversation, as he stood up to the brutish General and would not let him mistreat the women. Original things like the sex workers at the brothel being called "Petals" show that they really have taken care to flesh this world out and want you to get immersed in it.\nAnd the plot is multi-layered enough and full of enough content to be worthy of the Thief title.  By that I mean, there is initially enough content there for a full game - main bad guy, baddies, storyline, quests along it - but then it turns out there's something else, which leads to a different set of content than those things... and maybe something else again... I tell you, there is so much work put into this.\n\nWhy am I gushing when so many have written the game off, claiming they've completed it easily and  it was boring? Well, they didn't turn off all the helpers and max out the difficulty settings - this is the way the game is meant to be played, and causes you to take your time, and experiences all the subtleties that make the game what it is.\n\nAnd I believe this is the fault of the developer.  Sorry guys, if you had more guts and confidence in what you had to offer, and hadn't bent to the apparent whim of the general public to have their video game challenges made "easy" and "handed on a platter" then you would have not watered it down with so many "helper" options that neutralise all the experiences the game has to offer, and, like Dark Souls, simply presented the game the way it was meant to be played in the first place, and then taught the user how to play the game as they progress through.\n\nEven if someone held a gun to your head and said "No! You must provide a fisher-price baby easy way to play the game, or people will complain it's too hard!" then you could have opened with a simple difficulty choice menu that said "Easy mode - for casual gamers." and then  "Thief mode: play this mode for the full experience", the latter would disable all the helper settings and crank the difficulty up.  And then as a third option, a "Customise..." option which takes you to the settings menu that you have, where you can toggle the helpers and difficulty setting.\n\nI am glad this game exists, and that I'm still playing my way through (I think I'm half way?) and that there are so many damn side quests and extra jobs that I will be busy enough for the foreseeable future!   And yet I am sad - that the public opinion of this game has been sabotaged by the developers themselves, for not having the confidence to present the game the way it was meant to be played, by default, and as a result, it's unlikely we'll ever see another thief game again, especially of this calibre.","May 13","true","35.2"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","11","19","0","0"

I, personally, found myself enjoying most of the game, but even then, I could see where it went right and where it went wrong.\n\nThe relative non-linearity of the levels that encourages exploration: Good. The immersiveness of your character with simple things such as hands and feet, putting you into the shoes of Garrett: Good (great, for an immersion nut like myself). The phenominal graphics that breath life to what you would assume is a horribly dark and dank and dirty place with nothing else to offer: Good. But then you have the "bad" side of things. You have the port issues, with stuttery FPS in the hub areas. You have the inability to jump (for whatever reason), resulting in awkward moments, falls, and deaths that could rival those found in Assassin's Creed. You have the simplification of mechanics, a prime example of which being the rope arrow. What was once a creative way to both open up a level is now little more than a scripted event, or something that might as well be.\n\nAnd here's my biggest gripe: the fact that the player's actions can directly go against Garrett as a character. And in the most ridiculous sense, too. Early on in the game (and I suppose this is a spoiler, so...) Garrett and Erin — his trusty sidekick — have themselves a little game of "I bet I can steal more!" and shortly after they meet up again, Erin scoffs at his take. Garrett, the Master Thief himself, then replies "It's not about how much you steal, but what you steal" and she adds, "and how you steal it." And that's perfectly fine; a thrillseeker thief archetype who steals things of worth? That's kinda neat! "But hold on a second, I was just stealing forks and knives to sell for a pitiful one gold coin..." Yeah, kinda absurd, if you ask me. It's like Niko in GTA4 mourning about how he had to kill in the war, then gunning everyone down between missions. Garrett boasts about how it doesn't matter if you go around scrounging up tiny mathoms no one wants, then goes around doing exactly that. This is a problem not only because it goes against the narrative, but it devalues Garrett as a character. He's no longer the professional stealing to survive like he was in the old games, nor is he a thief stealing to both survive and because he has some thrill for the rush of it all. He's just a kleptomaniac, out to rob all of "The City" of their common household utensils. What an ♥♥♥, right? Easy fix to this would be to just make it so that you can rob people of their knives, forks, and spoons. There are plenty of actual trinkets, medals, busts, and collectables to pick up — stash a few more of those into the wardrobes, drawers, and cupboards, and we've got a nice and easy compromise... Unless Eidos was trying to make their "Master Thief" a kleptomaniac. :|\n\nAnyway, I'm bad at ending essays and anything utilizing one or more paragraphs, so...\n\ntl;dr Thief was a fun time, though it's hindered by quite a few issues that, while relatively small, are very apparent in the game and level design. The biggest of which (in my opinion) being a problem in the narrative... Which most might not even give a damn about. I still recommend it, though. I like the new voice actor better than the old one (don't kill me, pls), the graphics are stellar, the immersion is stellar, and if you can look through some of its issues and past the fog of nostalgia, it's not a bad game at all.\n\nIn terms of a score (for ease of use), we could say it's an 8/10 who slipped, fell, and landed on the 6.5/10 step.\n\nI'm eager to see what they do with the second game, when they inevitably release a second one.","January 2, 2015","true","16.1"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

I'm thinking there is a memory leak somewhere in the game or it just has not been optimized yet.  Also, I dunno if anyone else had a problem with this, but I couldn't drop of a rope when I was looking down and hitting space bar.  It's really crazy.  Probably some bugs scattered all around.  I would suggest this game if someone has a lot of money to burn on a super graphically enhanced computer similar to xbox one or something to that extent, I dunno.  It's disappointing to me that I should be able to run this smoothly and was proven wrong.

It's nowhere near as good as the originals, but it's not terrible, and it's updated.\n\nI've played Thief for roughly 7 hours, the city sucks to travel through and the map is completely horrible and there is never a clear direction. Thief shines when you're in a mission through a building or house, and stealing things under someones nose is really rewarding. Outsmarting guards never gets old either. So if you're a fan of stealth games, than Thief is a no brainer. But if you're fairly new to the genre, play Dishonored as it is a much more polished, fun, rewarding and realized experience. In my opinion Dishonored did Thief better than the new Thief did.\n\nI hope there is some kind of fast travel option implemented into Thief, because if I have to traverse through that map every time I need to get somewhere far away I'm simply going to stop playing, it's that bad.","February 25, 2014","true","30.8"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","19","35","0","0"

Although the new Thief was a bit harder to create since the last game of the series was released in 2004 and they had to keep the new game's atmosphere as close to the older ones as possible.\n\nStarting with the story it's not what you will remember after you have finished Thief. You will be expecting most of the plot twists and towards the end the story seems a bit far fetched. The City is divided in different areas or districts. The problem is that those districts are divided into smaller areas as well so there are frequent loading screens. Also the city offers an illusion of an open-world environment but the truth is that you can't go everywhere you want to. But even in a smaller area there are many paths you can follow to your destination whether it is on the rooftops or the roads.\n\nThe biggest problem of the game is it's AI. It may be easy for enemies to spot you but it is really easy to escape and hide. Just hiding in some shadows or climbing on a roof does the trick. Also their reactions to noises, torches of fires going off or when finding bodies are really bad. They may look around for a while and then go on with their patrols as if nothing happened.\n\nLeaving the games problems behind, the stealth mechanisms are really great. Garrett has a lot of tools and his trusted bow at his disposal which he can use to avoid his enemies or dispose of them. The City is filled with loot to steal and a lot of them (especially unique loot and collectibles) are really hard to find so that offers a good challenge. You will have to find safe combinations, secret passages behind bookcases and items hidden behind paintings. Sneaking around the city and searching every corner and every house for loot is really fun.\n\nIf it's hard for you to find loot you can use the Focus ability which highlights objects you can take or use and enemies. The thing is that Focus makes the game a lot easier so try to avoid using it as much as you can. Garret's abilities can be upgraded by buying (or findind) Focus points and you can also buy new tools or equipment upgrades from merchants around the city.\n\nThe game's graphics are great. Especially the character's faces which are really epxressive. The animations are smooth. As for the music, it gets a little annoying at times. For example when you are trying to sneak around somewhere and you hear music pounding in your ears. The voice-acting is good as well with Garrett's voice standing out.\n\nIf the bad AI is not a really big problem for you then Thief can give you a really great time. There are a lot of secrets to discover and finding them using Thief's stealth mechanincs is a real pleasure.\n\n75%","February 27, 2014","true","18.2"," 23 of 43 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","23","43","0","0"

I don't understand why a computer that is above and beyond the recommended specs is unable to run this game out-of-the-box. Anyhoo.\n\nOnce the game got working properly, the graphics are very pretty. I feel that the facial animations were a bit messed up, particularly in cutscenes, but besides that, the game looked nice.\n\nThe sound mechanics of the game are STUFFED UP. Someone might be two floors below you, with masses of stone separating you from them, yet you hear them like they're right next to you.\nYou're in a silent room. You peep through a keyhole, and you can see a couple people talking. Suddenly, you can hear their voices blaring at you, even though you backed away from the keyhole and (closed) door. Same goes for peeping through a hole in a thick stone wall. At first you can't hear a thing, then after you establish their presence, it's as though they're shouting in the same room with you.\nTrying to listen in on a conversation? You get close enough to hear a couple of people having a conversation. Except, one of the two people drop out to a barely audible murmur. But the person they're speaking to has their voice blaring as though speaking through a loudspeaker. This problem lead me to enable subtitles, just so I could read what they were saying. But do this, and you will be constantly bombarded with repetitious "background chatter" in the city. There were, like, 3 dialogue strings on repeat.\n\nThe story is abysmal. There are other reviews that go into detail plenty well enough that I won't repeat the problems here.\n\nBut, if you want a game that isn't a standard shooter, that has some creepy moments, pretty graphics, and lots of random loot to steal, give this game a go IF it's on special.","January 2, 2015","true","37.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The whole story feels very cobbled together, and none of it comes together very well, however it's a blast to play through for die hard stealth fans. The world is wonderfully put together with a large variety of environment puzzles to sneak through. There are many approaches to almost every situation. There are a few points in the game where you get bottlenecked into a single solution and they feel pretty glaring when you reach them because of how large the variety of options is almost everywhere else, but these moments are few and far between and many players may not even notice them.\n\nOver all, Thief is a solid entry into the series if you value gameplay over story telling. However if you feel that the characterization and story telling of the series to date has been your primary motivation for playing, then you may want to give this one a pass.","October 7, 2014","true","26.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I may change my feelings/opinions on it as I progress the game)\n\nThief is a good game for any of you stealth gaming enthusiasts.\nAlthough it's story is NOT very interactive, and you don't get the same sort of emotion you would get if you played any games such as, The Walking Dead by Telltale, it is still an overall good game.\n\nIn a graphic perspective, the game itself is very nice when it comes down to details, shadows, and lighting, but other than that the gameplay feels at points either too jumpy, or too slow paced. At some areas it feels like you have no idea what is going on, and you just want to 'beat' the chapter.\n\nAs of playing this game, I can't help but feel the way I did when I first tried to get into the game, 'Dishonored'. I kept feeling like I couldn't comprehend what was happening no matter how much the story progressed, and in the end I just got tired of it and had to stop playing it. Thief feels relatively similar to Dishonored's gameplay, but are not nearly the same in a matter of combat, or storyline. The stealth in Thief, which is what is made out to be it's "core gameplay mechanic", works very well if you try to play as a thief who must hide in the shadows and stay hidden. This can make the game feel VERY slow after a while, and eventually I gave up on hiding, as it proved useless when no guards where around.\n\nIn the aftermath of all that, this game does have some pretty bad AI. The AI which ussually consists of guards or at some points, just average townspeople, which seem to have a pretty mental way of thinking. If you throw a bottle directly at them, they either start getting confused, or walk in the complete opposite direction of where the sound percieved of the bottle smashing was heard.\n\nYou may be thinking at this point, why am I not stating any real positive outlooks on Thief? Well, that is simply because their isn't many. Like I stated either this game more or less a lighting showcase with some stealth and parkour.\n\nAfter defeating the first Chapter/Tutorial stage, you seem to notice a severe lack of things you could steal. At this point, it's more or less a parkour simulator with a few confusing stories and characters that I just don't seem to get attached to, or relate to at all. In fact, as of playing this game the only emotion I have felt is anger towards the AI for somehow not being able to spot you less than 2 inches away, while standing INFRONT of them... If your one of those people who want to look for a cool game that has action, "parkour" or stunts, and an interactive story, than this game is not for you. However, if you are looking for a linear game that focuses on one main topic and task, than this game is for you.\n\nOverall, I would say this game would get 6.5. Although I put a some-what negative look on Thief, this game could be fun for anyone who may have enjoyed games such as, Dishonored and Metal Gear Solid, and I would recommend it to any new-commers to stealthy gaming industry. However, if you are a fan of the original Thief series, and not this decently okay reboot, then I suggest not getting this game. Although I have never played any of the original Thief games, I have heard from many fans of them that this game misses out on some of the key elements used in the original games, which leads many original fans to dislike the way this games story and gameplay was delievered.\n\nWell that is it for my review of the game Thief, I hope you enjoyed reading this, and if you were wondering whether or not you wanetd to purchase this game I hope I helped you in making that decision.\n\n--Kv321 (Part of the E3D Network)\n\n\n\n","March 1, 2014","true","1.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Tripping over a bottle on the ground you didn’t notice and alerting a guard is hearthstoppingly tense, and the game is full of small cool details like that.\nThe extensive difficulty settings are also excellent, not content with just the easy medium hard settings, you can extensively customize the difficulty, feel like the focus ability makes the game to easy, turn it off, long for the days of Thief 1's saving methods, you can turn that on, and so on.\n\n\nThe Ugly.\nIt’s the small things in this game that drives me up the wall, the silly story I can easily look beyond, but the game is held back by a lot of small bad design decisions.\nFor example the locations of loading points in the open world will drive you crazy, why the nearest merchant to my hideout is in its own little area with its own loading time in and out is beyond me. Using slow quick time events to open a window to enter into a new area only to realize you already roped that apartment and having to do another slow quick time event to get back out gets old real quick. The map could have used some more work, or at least the ability to place your own notes on it would be nice, for example you can replay old missions by reentering them at their starting point, which is great, if it wasn’t for the fact that their location isn’t shown on the map after you done them, so if don’t remember where it was it can be problematic. The hideout is a nice touch but serves no real purpose (an idea would have been to allow you do redo old missions from your hideout, thereby giving you a reason to return to the bloody thing and saving me the trouble of running around the city trying to find the damn mission entrances, but I digress).\n\nConclusion.\nThis is almost the worst kind of game to play, there’s an excellent stealth game in here, but playing it can sometimes fell like death by a thousand tiny cuts, it can be very frustrating to feel hold back by small weird design choices.\nStill with all that said, it’s probably the best pure stealth game I played in recent times, a lot of my frustration stems from my love of the Thief series and its world, but if you are a fan of stealth it should still easily be worth your money.\n","March 1, 2014","true","20.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I wasn't the biggest fan of Deadly Shadows because of the third-person change so I'm glad they kept it first-person and I really like Garrett's modelling. Very cool.\n\nThe whole game is very 'Thief-esque' which I'm glad to see and I love the amount of things you can steal, since I'm a human magpie. The graphics are beautiful, the city is dark but when you go inside, there's lots of colour and character in each place you visit. The story is fine, I enjoyed playing it out but the ending felt a little quick and anti-climactic, mostly the last scenes.\n\nThere are only a few problems that I found with the game, and unfortunately some affect the game quite drastically - especially if you're playing the second time around to get every shiny you missed. Firstly, the mapping system is quite badly done, there's no names at all for any of the areas which is highly frustrating and would have probably made the fact that to get to most areas, you have to jump through people's windows and go through loading screens each time, a LOT less frustrating. It would be nice to know WHERE you are going. They probably would have been better off keeping a similar mapping system to the old Thief, they had labels and also showed you which parts of the level you've been to and which is undiscovered.\n\nAnother problem is that to replay chapters, you have to find the place where you began that chapter - impossible since there's no labelling and quite a lot of chapters!\n\nAlso, a minor issue really, but I would have really loved the word 'taffer' to make it back into Thief and maybe make the NPCs say a wider range of lines, they seem to be repeating the same ones over and over and it gets really frustrating.\n\nDespite the flaws, it's defintely a must-play, if you keep in mind that a lot of things are different. Including the lack of dagger/sword and a prompted blackjack instead of real-time. I'm not saying they affect the game much, they're just different.\n\nTHe first-time playthrough is very interesting and I was engrossed in it for days, I enjoyed it that much. I just wouldn't replay it, even though I wanted to, because the mapping system made it a lot less fun than it could have been.

I wasn't the biggest fan of Deadly Shadows because of the third-person change so I'm glad they kept it first-person and I really like Garrett's modelling. Very cool.\n\nThe whole game is very 'Thief-esque' which I'm glad to see and I love the amount of things you can steal, since I'm a human magpie. The graphics are beautiful, the city is dark but when you go inside, there's lots of colour and character in each place you visit. The story is fine, I enjoyed playing it out but the ending felt a little quick and anti-climactic, mostly the last scenes.\n\nThere are only a few problems that I found with the game, and unfortunately some affect the game quite drastically - especially if you're playing the second time around to get every shiny you missed. Firstly, the mapping system is quite badly done, there's no names at all for any of the areas which is highly frustrating and would have probably made the fact that to get to most areas, you have to jump through people's windows and go through loading screens each time, a LOT less frustrating. It would be nice to know WHERE you are going. They probably would have been better off keeping a similar mapping system to the old Thief, they had labels and also showed you which parts of the level you've been to and which is undiscovered.\n\nAnother problem is that to replay chapters, you have to find the place where you began that chapter - impossible since there's no labelling and quite a lot of chapters!\n\nAlso, a minor issue really, but I would have really loved the word 'taffer' to make it back into Thief and maybe make the NPCs say a wider range of lines, they seem to be repeating the same ones over and over and it gets really frustrating.\n\nDespite the flaws, it's defintely a must-play, if you keep in mind that a lot of things are different. Including the lack of dagger/sword and a prompted blackjack instead of real-time. I'm not saying they affect the game much, they're just different.\n\nTHe first-time playthrough is very interesting and I was engrossed in it for days, I enjoyed it that much. I just wouldn't replay it, even though I wanted to, because the mapping system made it a lot less fun than it could have been. As you can tell, I'm writing a mixed review here, which is sad for me since I am a huge fan of the Thief games.","September 5, 2014","true","28.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I may change my feelings/opinions on it as I progress the game)\n\nThief is a good game for any of you stealth gaming enthusiasts.\nAlthough it's story is NOT very interactive, and you don't get the same sort of emotion you would get if you played any games such as, The Walking Dead by Telltale, it is still an overall good game.\n\nIn a graphic perspective, the game itself is very nice when it comes down to details, shadows, and lighting, but other than that the gameplay feels at points either too jumpy, or too slow paced. At some areas it feels like you have no idea what is going on, and you just want to 'beat' the chapter.\n\nAs of playing this game, I can't help but feel the way I did when I first tried to get into the game, 'Dishonored'. I kept feeling like I couldn't comprehend what was happening no matter how much the story progressed, and in the end I just got tired of it and had to stop playing it. Thief feels relatively similar to Dishonored's gameplay, but are not nearly the same in a matter of combat, or storyline. The stealth in Thief, which is what is made out to be it's "core gameplay mechanic", works very well if you try to play as a thief who must hide in the shadows and stay hidden. This can make the game feel VERY slow after a while, and eventually I gave up on hiding, as it proved useless when no guards where around.\n\nIn the aftermath of all that, this game does have some pretty bad AI. The AI which ussually consists of guards or at some points, just average townspeople, which seem to have a pretty mental way of thinking. If you throw a bottle directly at them, they either start getting confused, or walk in the complete opposite direction of where the sound percieved of the bottle smashing was heard.\n\nYou may be thinking at this point, why am I not stating any real positive outlooks on Thief? Well, that is simply because their isn't many. Like I stated either this game more or less a lighting showcase with some stealth and parkour.\n\nAfter defeating the first Chapter/Tutorial stage, you seem to notice a severe lack of things you could steal. At this point, it's more or less a parkour simulator with a few confusing stories and characters that I just don't seem to get attached to, or relate to at all. In fact, as of playing this game the only emotion I have felt is anger towards the AI for somehow not being able to spot you less than 2 inches away, while standing INFRONT of them... If your one of those people who want to look for a cool game that has action, "parkour" or stunts, and an interactive story, than this game is not for you. However, if you are looking for a linear game that focuses on one main topic and task, than this game is for you.\n\nOverall, I would say this game would get 6.5. Although I put a some-what negative look on Thief, this game could be fun for anyone who may have enjoyed games such as, Dishonored and Metal Gear Solid, and I would recommend it to any new-commers to stealthy gaming industry. However, if you are a fan of the original Thief series, and not this decently okay reboot, then I suggest not getting this game. Although I have never played any of the original Thief games, I have heard from many fans of them that this game misses out on some of the key elements used in the original games, which leads many original fans to dislike the way this games story and gameplay was delievered.\n\nWell that is it for my review of the game Thief, I hope you enjoyed reading this, and if you were wondering whether or not you wanetd to purchase this game I hope I helped you in making that decision.\n\n--Kv321 (Part of the E3D Network)\n\n\n\n","March 1, 2014","true","1.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I think a lot of the problems people had with the game have to do with focus and their difficulty setting. I did a custom playthrough on master difficulty with focus, knockouts, kills, food, waypoints, and button prompts all turned off. I went through the game with the majority as a ghost and somewhat as an opportunist.  And while some problems still persisted, I think the game was really fun.\nSome of the missions in the game were not very fun, and linear. Mission 1, the end of 4, the end of 6, and part of 8 were not very fun, but the rest were pretty great.\n\nPros:\nExtremely fun stealth and gameplay, lots of different routes to take the majority of the game, lots of difficult loot to get, great side missions, majority of missions are fun, guards see you pretty easily (good thing). great atmosphere.  The city (will discuss below)\n\nCons:\nbugs in sound, guard pathfinding, and a few other things.  Awful soundtrack with dubstep when detected.  Pretty bad chase sequences and climbing sequences.  bad story\n\nOther than the gameplay, the best thing in the game, in my opinion, is the city or hub area.  It's huge and open, and with plenty of secret areas to discover.  It has very good atmosphere, with a lot of side missions and mini missions to do.  It has this feeling of despair which really helps the atmosphere out.\n\nOverall I liked the game a lot more than other people did. The last few missions were very tough and fun, and mission 5 is pretty creepy.\nGiven a score I'd say 7/10 good game (real 10 scale, not ign 9/10 it's garbage)","March 5, 2014","true","22.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Why can't people just judge a game based on it's own merits?\nThe stealth system is well done and challenging. Garrett has a lot of different ways to get past the guards. With the right knowledge you can be like a ghost, leaving no trace of you ever being there or you can go beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of them all (a tactic that is impossible on higher levels of difficulty). You have a bow with a variety of special arrows like water arrow, that puts out fires, rope arrow that helps you get to different places and maybe find more loot, unique items or even more ways to complete the mission and so on.\nThe graphics are nice but there are some problems with the sounds. Sometimes they work amazing and it will make you want to stay near a window for just a couple more seconds to hear the sad story of a family getting starved to death. Other times you will hear very loud guard voice even though you are on a rooftop or on a dark alley.\nThe atmosphere is amazing, the city is dark, dirty and full with guards, people with sleeping problems and beggars but sometimes it gets repetitive because every time you will want to get past an area there will always be a patrol of guards in the same place.\nThere are hours and hours of content with a long and decent story and rewarding side quests which have a rating system every time you finish them. You can see your playstyle, different statictics, challanges etc.\nConclusion: you will never be able to please people with a reboot of a classic like Thief. Sure the new "modern" games left their mark on this just as the old Thief games left their mark in the industry, you can't expect things to be the same  after all these years. I have no doubt that more than half on the people complaining didn't even play the old games.\n7/11","February 21, 2015","true","24.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Grabbing all the achievements in Thief took me about 47 hours total over the course of a few playthroughs, even with help finding the seven secret areas I overlooked.\n\nTaking on the role of the eponymous main character you'll have to make your way through the city you call home, old forgotten ruins beneath it, a mental institution on the other side of the river, and even your own mind. Parts of Thief play like something directly out of a horror game and manage to do it better than most games that make horror their focus. Speaking of Garrett, the man's got a great sense of humor. His zippy one-liners never disappoint.\n\nThe art direction in Thief is drab, but appropriate. The game is set in an authoritarian citystate on the verge of societal collapse. The colors of any given scene are gray and brown, with a bit of blue and white thrown in for lighting. Interspersed with the dull scenery are carefully placed spots of shadow that you'll need to take advantage of if you want to remain unseen and/or not die, and thousands of shinies you'll need to collect if you want to complete the game.\n\nOne final note on appearances: I've never liked the "steampunk" aesthetic, so watching the grungy patchwork technology in some parts of the game fall to pieces the way it would in the real world brought me no small amount of secret vindictive pleasure.\n\nWhile each chapter is fairly linear there are usually multiple ways of progressing and different ways of approaching each situation. Very rarely does the main game restrict your options- if you want to muscle your way past the guards and take what you're after by force, you usually can if you're good enough with your blackjack. Just don't try that with the Freaks in the lower levels of the old city; it won't end well. You can also replay each chapter to try something different by revisiting the chapter's starting location. You will need to memorize them or look them up, though, they're not marked on your map.\n\nI was a little disappointed that there were only two boss fights in the game. I know not every chapter of a game should have a final encounter, but only two? There's so much you can do with stealth games like this one to build entertaining showdowns so Thief loses a few points here by my reckoning. A word of caution about the final boss... on the hardest difficulty possible (custom settings only, I think) the final boss is a game of breakneck hide-and-seek where being found means you die. Instantly. I'm never doing that again and if achievements are your cup of tea I wish you luck. Hint: move clockwise.\n\nFlaws notwithstanding, Thief would make a great Christmas gift- nothing says "holiday spirit" like breaking into other people's homes, taking their things, and dispensing wanton vandalism and violence along the way. Deck the halls.","October 2, 2015","true","46.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

We've been waiting 10 years for another Thief game, and although this is not the direct continuation of trilogy it is still a very good game.\n\nYou can adjust the difficulty level to your liking. Don't like focus? Turn it off. As in other Thief games, you are not forced to kill anyone, you can either sneak past them or knock them out. Some loot can be tricky to find, some are in plain sight but are still out of your reach until you pull the right trigger.\n\nThough this is a remake, it's has nice touch about the original Thief's past: Hammerites cathedral, references to Trickster, cog shaped loot (hint toward the Mechanists), Keeper's Library - it is all sentimental in this new instalment.\n\nVery nice music and graphics, steam punk, dark feel about the story. The story though might be one weaker side of this game. It's not as full and reach as it was in previous trilogy games. Nevertheless I like the game and hopefully we will see Garrett again. Or his apprentice from the end of the trilogy.","February 28, 2015","true","38.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is mostly about sneaking carefully from place to place, stealing everything of value you can lay your hands on, and this game does a good job of ramping up the tension when you risk detection.  The sense of atmosphere this game creates is strong, but very different from its predecessors.  For those more accustomed to action games, there are a few more active scenes in which you must make a hasty escape, but fighting is usually not an option.\n\nThe game has an almost movie-like style to it, although this is very common in commercially produced games.  There are plenty of unique, collectible treasures to gather, which you can keep and admire after returning to your hideout, and a lot of secrets to find.  The focus ability is useful, not only enhancing your abilities for a time, but also making it easier to navigate and spot important objects, such as traps, switches and ropes.\n\nNow we come to the cons.  For fans of the previous games, Thief is likely to be something of a disapointment.  Many of the fantasy elements of the game have been removed.  Hammerites and Pagans are nowhere to be seen, although some signs of their former presence can be seen here and there.  Elemental crystals are no longer used on Garret's arrows and have been replaced with mechanical or alchemical alternatives.  Rope arrows can now only be used in very specific locations, as they can no longer lodge in the scenery.  Even the word "taffer" has fallen out of common use among the city people, replaced with more familiar swear words.  Although this is probably meant to give the game a more mature style, it actually has the opposite effect and makes the characters seem somewhat juvenile.\n\nThe cinematic style of the game, as I have already noted, is very similar to most other modern games and doesn't really seem to fit.  The hand-drawn animations of the previous games are gone.  Even the upgrade system is somewhat generic and seems like a half-hearted attempt to imitate other games.  The storyline is also very different in style to the previous games.  While not exactly bad, it often attempts to depict Garret as vulnerable and insecure, as if to draw attention to his softer side.  Although some may find this intriguing, I thought it seemed somewhat contrived.  The game's ending is abrupt and leaves a lot of loose ends, giving the impression that the final cinematic was abandoned half-finished.\n\nAll in all, this is a decent stealth game in its own right, but for fans of the previous instalments, like myself, Thief marks the death of the series and the beginning of a long line of dull, generic, mass-produced sequels.  If you love stealth games, treasure hunting and a strong dark atmosphere, this game is for you.  However, if you liked the previous games, avoid it.  Unless you are prepared for the drastic change in style, this game will leave you feeling empty and unfulfilled.","March 10, 2014","true","21.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm surprised! You and I both expected me to flat-out dislike this game because I'm a long-time fan of the franchise, didn't we? But it really is not total crap.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, all references to "classic Thief" elements such as the Hammerite symbol, the Keeper statuette, Garrett's mechanical eye, guards mentioning the word "taffer, etc., they are all just nods and easter eggs paying homage to the original trilogy. There's some clumsy attempts to dovetail the rebooted universe with the old but it's too nonsensical to take seriously. And why use the name Basso for new-Garrett's fence? Why not use Cutty? Old-Basso was just a boxman (expert lockpicker).\n\nThe city hub makes a return in Thief 4. I know some people who didn't mind it in Thief 3, but I know *nobody* who LIKED it. Its reuse here only served to pad gameplay time with tedious walking back and forth. Thief 2's "Life Of the Party" mission had Garrett traversing the city rooftops from his home all the way to Angelwatch. In that single mission alone, the world-building achieved by the things you witness and the conversations you overhear on the way to the actual mission area gave that Thief-universe more heart and soul than this entire game did for its own universe. I'll never forget the pejorative 'taffer' or the battle between the guards of Lady van Vernon's house and Master Willey's castle. A few weeks from now all I'll remember about Thief 4 is "sloop" and "Garrett, I'm slipping!"\n\nAnalogy time: This game is about as classic Thief as the movie "World War Z" was a faithful adaptation of the book, i.e. not even a little bit. Now, now, this is a reboot, sure, sure. I'm already accounting for that and I'm still making this statement! The thing they've created here does not inherit enough Thief-y essence to rightfully call itself a reimagination of the original intellectual property. This game and that movie should have no right to affiliate themselves with those respective IPs. The only reason they have each done so is because their creators did not have faith in their products to stand alone on their own merits.","January 20, 2015","true","92.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Thief's time is set to be in both medieval / modern century with electricity and fire with alot of sword play. This game will keep you on your toes most of the time and has an interest in horror.\n\nCharacters and AI: You are Garret, the master thief, king of rats. Master of stealth and loves to steal things. Yet you have a heart for the city in which you live in, making your actions duable in the sence that you are the good guy.\n\nEren: A young woman who partners up with Garret and ♥♥♥♥s everything up in the begining.\n\nAI: The AI are ok and someare scary, never the less they have a specific pattern in which they move and can't seem to see ♥♥♥♥ in the dark unless they are really close.\n\nThe game is very detailed to the biggest of buildings to the finest crack in a piece of wood. It looks beautiful. But it's always dark. This game also likes to jump around in the story, linking things from the past to the future, which is really cool and all, but lacks interest and a sence of excitement. Only a few scenes in the game were actually really good, but other than that it's a very slow game. After a few missions, instead of sneaking passed the gaurd, you start to kill them in glorious fashions, reducing the amount of time, but killing the experience and atmousphere.\n\nCombat and movement: The moevment is fine the there are issues with the combat and climbing. When it comes to seriously climbing stough, the character can't seem to do what you want him to do even though the objective is right infront of you. It's frustrating. And the combat sucks, whenever you dodge, you get hit, making it even more frustrating. So for those who want to play this game, make sure you have a good computer! This game will lag alot if you don't and get ready to take things slow, don't rush them.","July 10, 2015","true","19.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Thief-Taker general had potential but never really got much character development.\n\nHas technical problems such as well known audio problems.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Simolius/recommended/239160/","Simolius","Simolius@AgualvaCity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Simolius/","234 products in account","Thief is both one of the best stealth games I've ever played and a game I couldn't wait take off my "to finish" list, and here is why. Before starting though, I must say I never played any of the older Thief games at the time of writing.\n\nSo, Thief has a crap story. The lore sounds cool, and it makes you wish the devs would make more games to expand on that lore but the story of this game is really weak. You never really care about the person Garrett is trying to save because she is gone in 5 seconds after the game starts, Garrett himself isn't a very developed character, the side characters also have about 5 seconds of exposure in cutscenes, the bad guy who chases you and is supposed to be one of the bosses is just the bad guy who chases you, etc... The plot ultimately gets screwed by these weak characters even though it actually had potential to be decent.\n\nThat pretty much describes a lot of the game in my opinion, half the game is the greatest stealth game ever made, the other half is negative stuff that makes Thief a decent game instead of an amazing game. The gameplay is great! Great stealth mechanics, you can use your multiple types of arrows to mess with lighting by putting out or lighting up fires, cause distractions, release poison gas or just skewer some faces. You can use a limited "focus" ability to highlight objects and people of interest which you can use to spot loot and other stuff in the dark. The sneaking around is very responsive and you can smoothly slide, climb and crawl around the levels stealing all the gold from under everyone's nose and even from inside their pockets, making you feel like a badass parkour-master super-thief.\n\nThe best part of the game is the fact that sneaking is the proper and practically only way to play. Trying to fight enemies face to face doesn't usually end up very well, so you can't pull a Deus Ex: HR / Crysis / Hitman: Absolution when you're bored or in a hurry and just run and gun the whole level (more like run and mace-to-da-face). So you really have to focus on the stealth, you have to create distractions and mess with the lighting and pull takedowns from behind or try to parkour your way around the rooftops and avoid everyone. At the same time, the reason why I was getting tired of this game is the same reason why the game is a great stealth game. You can only use stealth. Although the ability to go all guns-blazing in Human Revolution or Crysis or Hitman Absolution shoves the stealth to the side a bit by making this messy playstyle viable, it's also a good way to vary things up a bit when you get bored of sneaking everywhere. I did it in Human Revolution near the end, I did it in some Hitman Absolution levels, I did it a lot in Crysis. You can't do it in Thief. Here, when you get bored of slowly sneaking around, you gotta keep slowly sneaking around. Half way through the game I got bored of stealthing everything and i just had to push through with that boredom, which really sucked.\n\nThief is still a great game though, unfortunately slightly screwed by it's own strength and lazy use of the world and lore resulting in a weak story, but still a very enjoyable stealth game. Some of the best sneaking around in a game ever.... Just beware of the asylum level, you might be led to think you accidentaly switched to playing Outlast.\n\nScore: 4/5\n\nSimolius - July 2015","July 6, 2015","true","20.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'd recommend it to most people, because of the variety of methods of going about the game. It doesn't matter if you're a sneaky thief who doesn't even knock anyone out, who is never even known to be there. Or if you're the more violent thief who kills everything in sight and is feared by the contending factions.\n\nGameplay - 8/10 Well, this can be a bit of a controversial subject, I thought the story was fairly good (about a 6/10) but the other gameplay (I.E sidemissions) also offer a chance for a different type of fun).\n\nGraphics - 8/10 The graphics are pretty good. sometimes you get a slight drop in frame rate (I did, but all the settings were set to absolute max, and I'm playing on a laptop.\n\nSound - 7/10 The sound is pretty good, better in combat scenarios, however you have a good ambiance created through everything combined, which results in a decent atmosphere to coincide with the game play.\n\nOverall - 7.5/10. I enjoyed this game, there are several options to make the game harder, including in mission challenges and other fun things. Should take about 13 hours to complete everything on medium difficulty, and 15 on the hardest.

We've been waiting 10 years for another Thief game, and although this is not the direct continuation of trilogy it is still a very good game.\n\nYou can adjust the difficulty level to your liking. Don't like focus? Turn it off. As in other Thief games, you are not forced to kill anyone, you can either sneak past them or knock them out. Some loot can be tricky to find, some are in plain sight but are still out of your reach until you pull the right trigger.\n\nThough this is a remake, it's has nice touch about the original Thief's past: Hammerites cathedral, references to Trickster, cog shaped loot (hint toward the Mechanists), Keeper's Library - it is all sentimental in this new instalment.\n\nVery nice music and graphics, steam punk, dark feel about the story. The story though might be one weaker side of this game. It's not as full and reach as it was in previous trilogy games. Nevertheless I like the game and hopefully we will see Garrett again. Or his apprentice from the end of the trilogy.","February 28, 2015","true","38.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Labcat/recommended/239160/","Labcat","Labcat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Labcat/","90 products in account","EDIT: After playing through the game, in its entierty, I think that playing as Erin (in a scenario where Garret dies, and you're left to play as Erin), would be much more interesting, rewarding, and with a character that is much more fleshed out than Garret. I did not change my key points, nor my opinion of the game, during the playthrough.\n\nThief is not about thieving.\nThere, I said it.\nAfter playing the same mission time and time again because the game wasn't made for the mode I wish for it to be, I decided to do this review about Thief, the new one.\nI've played the old Theifs. When I preordered back in September something I saw the gameplay videos, it was going to be extravagant, something new, something exciting! I had already preordered, I could cancel, sure, but that would make the action I made moot. I saw with some distaste in my mouth how the game was going to be linear, unlike the original. I figured it was fine, the experience could still be swell. Then I saw how the adventure itself was going to become very short. And I figured that was just casuals breezing through, I would have fun, lots of it, at least triple of what an average playthrough would be. And I was correct, it will be at least triple of an average playthrough, because I haven't finished the Second Map yet, after 17 h. (Which can be seen in my achievements tab)\nBack to the old Theif. This game is not the same experience as the old Thief is. In Thief: Gold had you explore an area, every inch and nut and bolt and screw, and you still wouldn't find every lootable item. Every map was a pleasure to explore, and so long you didn't kill anyone, you could reign free in your merry little map, without anything stopping you. (Well, just keep a spare Flashbomb, and you won't have any issues with guards that do detect you.)\nThe new Thief, so far, and I don't expect much more from it, has such a linear mapstyle, that I find it even hard to miss the damn loot. Apart from the loot that is hidden away in someones brightly lit room, and heavily guarded door, that is. Every part of the maps, even if they in themselves are quite large, are very predictable, and does not offer much choices of approach for the pathing you wish to perform. Most oftenly so are you placed at the entrance of a room, enabled a large view of the situation at hand, and then roughly three parthways to accompany it:\nThe the-way-you-will-probably-take-every-time-you-replay-the-map-from-the-start.\nThe inadequate path.\nThe worse-than-above path.\nWhilst I do like the freedom of choice, it feels somewhat lacking. Due to the fact that the maps are so linear, the point of using any other entrance, or exit, than the first one stated, is dubious.\nHowever, the idea of the city, not that I have looked that much into it, seems pretty good. A hub for going from mission to mission, where you can spend some past time between missions, or just fool around, I guess.(Not that I would know, I can't knock anyone unconsious, get detected, and on top of that, I have chapter saves.)\n\nNow that you know some of the game, I will go back to my first statement.\nThief is not based around thieving.\nYou might ask yourself why.\nWell:\n\n-You can finish the game without stealing a single dime of non-quest items.\n\nThis in itself, for a Thief game, is one thing that actually might make you reconsider not getting this "for old time's sake".\nOne of the most noticable challenges of Thief Gold is that if you don't have the required loot, you can't finish your current escapade. On easy, sure, it isn't that hard, but on Expert you have to search everywhere to find the last little stack of coin you missed because you blinked that one time you turned left, and that's just to finish the map, not get all the loot.\nIn the new Theif, there is no required loot, apart from the the loot you went out to get, and that kind of makes Garret lose some character, in my opinion, it's almost as if I can agree to one part of what Erin says in the beginning, "...it's about getting in the loot". Garret does not agree, seemingly.\n\n-The game itself seems based around two playstyles, with minor niches being allowed, if you sacrifice some of the gameplay.\n\nI do not agree with this sort of production, where as the producers wants "freedom of choice", but disables that for something I'd say is conforming too much to modern media. Sure, you have the freedom to choose between either beating the crap out of everyone, and getting all the loot; or running around, avoiding detection whilst still being able to steal all the loot if you perform SOME takedowns. Anything in between, and you can't experience the whole game, and getting all the loot. The old Theif gave you a plan, an a sketch, and an entrance, then you were free to do what ever the heck got your pants wet, with real interruptions. (Location-based are cool and all. The FIRST time.) They created a custom ruleset, and I created my own profile with the settings that I wanted, something a bit more hardcore than your average 6h playthrough. Though, when I created this, I expected to be able to loot everything, but that is not what seems to be important here. Much more emphasis is put on you being able to puzzle through the maps as swiftly as possible, (I mean, heck, you could just ignore all the loot while you're at it!) to then experience a cutscene which enbroadens the story by a bit, to which you then proceed to do the same thing over again, which brings me to my next point!\n\n-Even though Garret is a thief, he probably does not give ♥♥♥♥, either mentally or economically, about loot.\n\nWith the facts stated above, we can do the conclusion that Garret either has stole enough, and has enough to live on, and that he probably does not steal loot out of spite, to prove that he is better than the other people.\nThis isn't Garret to me. Whoever created this Garret put too much emphasis on poor emotions, and too little on loot.\nI kind of wish I could play Erin instead, and just ♥♥♥♥ everything up, and steal some ♥♥♥♥, because Garret is one sad ♥♥♥♥er in this game, almost literally.\n\n\nHowever, as a standalone, because I think that's what they were going for, (Because they were really not true to the original character, however they managed to reimagine him like this.) The game is playable, flows well, and has a good feeling to it, disregarding the earlier Thief.\n\nDisambiguation:\nYou play as a Thief called Garret. (Not to be confused with Garret from Thief: The Dark Project, Thief: The Metal Age, Thief: Deadly Shadows, or Thief Gold.)\nThe graphics look really well, even on a mediocerly weak computer.\nThe mechanics of the game make for a good flow, but can be clonky at times. (I'm looking at you, crates. >.>)\nThe story is kind of meh. Not really that memorable characters, (Thus far, but if the main protagonist isn't that interesting, well, then you've gone goofed.)\nThe gameplay is rewarding, and I think even more so should you not use custom settings.\nCustom gamerules settings! Not everything is determined on the spot just by picking a difficulty(But it could, your choice.)\nNegative: The A.I. is as blind as deepwaterfishes (I guess the stealthsystem wouldn't quite work if they saw you as any regular human being with vision does, and the game is kind of based on the stealthsystem)\nPositive: A.I. are dumber than bricks. (Something that was closed is open. "♥♥♥♥, gotta go check. ♥♥♥♥♥hitshit visitors, where are you ♥♥♥♥ers?" Something that was closed, to then be opened, is now closed "Yes, less work tonight, dis chill m8 patrollin' on!")\n\nThe game is playable. Should you enjoy it more or less, well that's up to you. Do you like stealth FPS', then this MIGHT be a game for you. It really is what you make it out to be, custom gamerules settings considered.\n\nTL;DR\n9/11\n"It's a blast" -♥♥♥♥nugger McCat♥♥♥♥er\n72 virgins warranty if you do not enjoy the experience.","June 17, 2014","true","25.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Finished review below.\n\nI can't play the game - after trying and trying I had to give up due to the non-mappable controls and my physical limitatrions. It seems a good game, so I'm going to give it a recommended. But my original review still stands. Its a console port, and it shows. If you (like me) absolutely need mappable controls for whatever reason, you won't like this - and I cant recommend it in that case.\n\nDEVS- MAKE THE CONTROLLER MAPPABLE. THIS IS NOT A FREAKING CONSOLE.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nNote: I am ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as hell whenever a dev (especially an AAA dev) is too lazy to include controller mapping in their PC games. Ive posted and wrote about this many times before. I hate to have to beat the dead horse again, but - TO ALL DEVS: For people with limited use of some of their fingers or hand(s) mappable controllers can be the difference between being able to enjoy a game and walking away in frustration.\n\nThats the reason why a lot of people with physical issues play PC instead of consoles, the extreme customizability of inputs. For you to not take the extra time to make the controller maps customizable is just stupid. Now I have to go spend time screwing with JoytoKey/all the other key-to-controller progs and that never works as well as native controller support and is a pain in the ♥♥♥. I'm not going to let it influence my review because for most people its a minor issue, but if you are like me and need the customizability of a fully mappable controller, you might take this into consideration.","June 15, 2014","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Just to name one example on the ‘love, hate’ thing.\n\nIn short, I would recommend this for stealth fans, and fans of the Thief series; the later if with the caveat and warning of the game being quite different from the rest of the series.\n\nFor all others:\n\nFor good or ill, this really feels like a larceny simulator with a fantasy twist. If that sounds interesting to you, you might enjoy it, but Gareth is very, very weak, and even a single guard may kill you if you are unprepared\n.\nUnlike this studious previous outing, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, combat is usually not an equal option unless you are really good at it, or spend a lot of money, time and upgrades on making it so; something that will eat up resources that could have been much better spent elsewhere.\n\nSo if you have some patience this can be a very rewarding game you will lose dozen if not hundreds of hours to... but gamers aimed more at the action side of things need not apply.","November 7, 2014","true","36.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is designed in a way that even if it looks like there are 3 different paths to take, there's only one that really works.\n\nThe sound design is absolutely abismal. People who are far away will sound like they're right next to you, even if they're in a whole other room. This leads to a lot of frustrating instances, where your cover is blown by enemies you thought where much further away. Not to mention it basically ruins any attempt for the game to establish the dark atmosphere it's going for.\n\nThe combat is really stupid too. You basically press R, then hold Q when it tells you to. It really only gets difficult when you're fighting groups of 3 or more. At that point you might as well restart the checkpoint, because they will mob you. You could just kill them with your arrows, but since arrows are the only items that let you interact with the environment, you'll waste your most valuable tool for getting through the mission.\n\nI really wanted to like this game. The graphics are amazing, the animation is spot on, and the controls are tight.\nBut the game is just about ruined by the lazy design.\n\n\n\n","December 1, 2014","false","3.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I jumped into this game on the hardest difficulty available, and am loving it. The emphasis on stealth and trickery as opposed to brute force is a delight not often experienced in modern gaming. This is a game I'd like to see further delved into, as there is tons of potential. While I am aware that it is a remake, I still hope for the addition of traps, misdirection (besides throwing a bottle) and subterfuge. Adding cinematic stealth kills (or takedowns) would've been nice as well.\nThe enemies aren't cheap or stupid like in most stealth games, forcing you to perform recon and planning around the situation. And believe me, planning is imperative, as you are not an indestructible force of death. Getting surrounded is usually a one-way trip to the reload screen. The Focus mechanic doesn't wreck the game by making it stupidly easy and performs well enough to make it a useful tool as opposed to either a liability or a dependancy.\nAll in all, a great experience for stealth game fans, both new and old. There are a few things I would chage with the platforming (Sometimes your character will happily jump to his doom, but refuse to step over a two inch ledge). Other than that, this game is a stellar example of the ingenuity that was so common before modern gaming.","February 27, 2014","true","15.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I enjoyed this game more because of the mood/setting (dark/gothic), as well as the story and characters.\n\nThe game - including all side quests and the Bank Heist DLC mission - took me about 20 hours. So if you're looking for a decent stealth game to play and you have the cash to buy this on sale ($15), it's not a bad idea. But don't place your expectations too high.

I've never played the other entries in the Thief series, so I had no point of reference there. Rather, I was coming off of stealth-heavy games like DX:HR and Dishonored. Though the mechanics and options for getting around feel more restricted in Thief than in those two games, I felt that the immersion made up for it, and once I got the hang of things, gameplay was fluid and pretty intuitive.\n\nI really like the game, but for those who are fans of the previous games, I suggest reading the reviews that make comparisons there.","June 10, 2014","true","32.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Looking Glass created the most amazing game that never really took off, but had developed a huge cult following. The first two were masterpieces. Sneak, infiltrate in numerous ways, hide, blackjack, steal loot, hide bodies, fight the undead, watch your step, you name it. Reading what goes on during the day in each place that had things to read made it feel like you were immersed in the world. No other game has EVER left me hungry and literally shaking in excitement for more.\n\nThief 3 was a bit of a step down, but it wrapped things up in quite a decent and surprising way. Warren Spector supervised it and many from the Looking Glass staff came to create it. Alas, it wasn't the same as the first two, but it had a charm to it...minus the load zones of course.\n\nThen comes in the Thief reboot....where to begin...although graphically decent and polished in the skills of surprise, combat, ingenuity in gadgets, a progression system to help improve yourself as a thief, and a decent city to explore, it cannot make up for the severe woes that plague this game. The plot is fairly decent, as is the voice acting (outside of the lack of Stephen Russell) and the atmosphere is there, dark, foggy, gritty at points, you get the idea. The lockpicking is pretty cool and they added finding switches and levers in bookcases and behind paintings. So, the game actually makes you feel more like a professional. Back to my previous comment about the woes, with all the positives I have said so far, you'd think it was the Thief game we fans were waiting for. The woes, which can be summed up in one word: Scripted.\n\nThe whole game feels like a forced script. Where the originals had many ways to tackle entering, solving, exploring an area, and completing a mission, this game feels like it runs on a linear rail. You'd be lucky sometimes to find more than one path to finish a mission where the others let you go at it and figure it out on your own. I felt like I was being forced to go on one path alone and then get done with it. Sure, it branches off to different rooms sometimes, but not many. Loot is so easy to snag and the AI is easy to fool. The game seems to just want you to get into conflicts to save yourself from the bordeom. In the originals, knowing whether or not a guard is going to catch you was thrilling, in this, getting caught is so easily unavoidable that it's childs play. Even turning off the assistance the game gives you like the notice eyes for the guards and civilians still can't make up for the lack of challenge this game presents. The explorative factors are gone and replaced with one path, a scripted sequence which could be a cutscene to a daring escape Assassins Creed style, and then stupid simple puzzles or platform jumps that are so predictable.\n\nThis game could have been a masterpiece, but I get the feeling Eidos M catered to the classic "simplicity" I see with many games nowadays, much like how Diablo 3 was severely watered down (and still is, but recent patches and the expansion at least have made it enjoyable) with the removal of the skill tree replaced with simply combining different spells, that sort of thing.\n\nOverall, Thief is a slightly above fair game. It's creativity, atmosphere, and progression system is heavily overshadowed by a one path, one solution, do it or don't play sort of feeling that haunts you chapter to chapter. Had this game had the same level design of the first ones, this could have been a highly anticipated reboot that I could have said was better than Thief 3. Thief 3 is still better than this game and it's shocking to say that considering you can do so much more in the reboot, but Thief 3 had more to explore and more ways to tackle things despite being as claustraphobic as it was at points. Newcomers, give it a shot I suppose, but play Thief 1 or 2 for true experiences. Thief fans like me, get ready for a big disappointment.\n\n6 out of 10","June 15, 2015","false","8.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I never played previous Thief games, but even if some fans of the series felt disappointed with this installation, I believe the review must be about the game itself, and not its heritage. After all, it's a reboot. So far I'm enjoying it; it doesn't blow my mind, but it doesn't annoy me. It's against murder, which is nice, and even if thieving is immoral, well, frankly it feels much less criminal than those endless cash registers in Bioshock. The graphics are well made, character movements do not cause dizziness, it's a well made game. Worth getting with a discount, for sure. I'll write more when I finish it.\n\nUpdate: I'm still playing the game, now after a GPU upgrade it became evident that it is much more enjoyable with a higher frame rate. However, two flaws are also evident: controls and sound bugs. During a chase scene I had a considerable difficulty getting hero to run and jump when needed. The sound system is buggy - phrases are either not heard, or heard too loud, or cut off, etc. But on balance, the game is enjoyable and different enough to be a memorable experience.

Yes it's not really a successor to the original and acclaimed thief series.\nThe product is a console-player-streamlined dishonored-like without superpowers.\nMovement is restricted: jumping/climbing only where possible and also rope arrows can't be fired in any wood but assigned places (to not make it too difficult for kids). You can't place crates to create shortcuts, reach ledges or hide. You can't throw stuff to distract only the bottles designed for that purpose.\nGareth the cynical thief we loved becomes Gareth the emo dude with a mean GF but it's not that bad as I made it sound. (in fact in reviews the Erin character was usually reviled - she casually murders a guard in the beginning - but I think given her history and everything the character works and as you discover in the game the guards are a bunch of fascists anyway)\n\nNow why the recommendation?\nOn it's own without the mighty thief series as comparison the game is a quiet good simulation of sneaking, stealing stuff and parcour. Aside from game design, bugs and handling problems the game shows AAA production values. For 10 bucks it's good entertainment.\nFor all the reasons outlined Dishonored feels like a much better production and was dubbed the spiritual thief successor (has Trickster, more steampunk and style) but Corvo is an overpowered killing machine who always has several ways to easily dispatch stuff while Gareth remains a fragile dude who has to strike from the shadows and he's a much better sneak at it. It's a different approach and also very satisfying to play.\nApproaching the last mission now and the game hits the sweet spot between being the badass takedown sneaker and the close combat wimp.\nYou'll have a lot of exciting moments where you escape detection by a hair.\nIt's fun to nail an arrow through a guard's eye from the shadows.\nGood lot of content with large main missions and several smaller 15 minute side missions.\nBunch of rare collectables and secret treasure hidden in every corner.\n\n\nOther unsorted impressions and rants\n\nAtmosphere is dark and gothic. I like the visual style and the game characters actually. Voice-acting ranges from poor to good. New Gareth is not old Gareth of legend but an ok dude for a hero.\nMission 5 is the thief-obligatory horror mission.\nWhile the story is usual an excuse to steal stuff and go see places it's especially illogical and obscure here and the ending is just dumb and unrewarding.\nThere are no hammerites or pagans anymore.\nAmbient conversations are projected on your position without any speaker existing - making it appear like you hear ghost voices in your head as noises and conversations from guards are correctly coming from their position.\nOh and often you're supposed to mash some button like to pry a  window. Completely useless feature in a game - should be patched out from ANY game (Batman games come to mind). Ruins your gear so you buy another overpriced controller.\nClumsy "context sensitive controls" - you probably lean on a chest more often than loot it or fumble with controls while avoiding guards in pursuit.","February 8, 2015","true","27.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I never played previous Thief games, but even if some fans of the series felt disappointed with this installation, I believe the review must be about the game itself, and not its heritage. After all, it's a reboot. So far I'm enjoying it; it doesn't blow my mind, but it doesn't annoy me. It's against murder, which is nice, and even if thieving is immoral, well, frankly it feels much less criminal than those endless cash registers in Bioshock. The graphics are well made, character movements do not cause dizziness, it's a well made game. Worth getting with a discount, for sure. I'll write more when I finish it.\n\nUpdate: I'm still playing the game, now after a GPU upgrade it became evident that it is much more enjoyable with a higher frame rate. However, two flaws are also evident: controls and sound bugs. During a chase scene I had a considerable difficulty getting hero to run and jump when needed. The sound system is buggy - phrases are either not heard, or heard too loud, or cut off, etc. But on balance, the game is enjoyable and different enough to be a memorable experience. I still recommend it.","June 15, 2014","true","17.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Looking Glass created the most amazing game that never really took off, but had developed a huge cult following. The first two were masterpieces. Sneak, infiltrate in numerous ways, hide, blackjack, steal loot, hide bodies, fight the undead, watch your step, you name it. Reading what goes on during the day in each place that had things to read made it feel like you were immersed in the world. No other game has EVER left me hungry and literally shaking in excitement for more.\n\nThief 3 was a bit of a step down, but it wrapped things up in quite a decent and surprising way. Warren Spector supervised it and many from the Looking Glass staff came to create it. Alas, it wasn't the same as the first two, but it had a charm to it...minus the load zones of course.\n\nThen comes in the Thief reboot....where to begin...although graphically decent and polished in the skills of surprise, combat, ingenuity in gadgets, a progression system to help improve yourself as a thief, and a decent city to explore, it cannot make up for the severe woes that plague this game. The plot is fairly decent, as is the voice acting (outside of the lack of Stephen Russell) and the atmosphere is there, dark, foggy, gritty at points, you get the idea. The lockpicking is pretty cool and they added finding switches and levers in bookcases and behind paintings. So, the game actually makes you feel more like a professional. Back to my previous comment about the woes, with all the positives I have said so far, you'd think it was the Thief game we fans were waiting for. The woes, which can be summed up in one word: Scripted.\n\nThe whole game feels like a forced script. Where the originals had many ways to tackle entering, solving, exploring an area, and completing a mission, this game feels like it runs on a linear rail. You'd be lucky sometimes to find more than one path to finish a mission where the others let you go at it and figure it out on your own. I felt like I was being forced to go on one path alone and then get done with it. Sure, it branches off to different rooms sometimes, but not many. Loot is so easy to snag and the AI is easy to fool. The game seems to just want you to get into conflicts to save yourself from the bordeom. In the originals, knowing whether or not a guard is going to catch you was thrilling, in this, getting caught is so easily unavoidable that it's childs play. Even turning off the assistance the game gives you like the notice eyes for the guards and civilians still can't make up for the lack of challenge this game presents. The explorative factors are gone and replaced with one path, a scripted sequence which could be a cutscene to a daring escape Assassins Creed style, and then stupid simple puzzles or platform jumps that are so predictable.\n\nThis game could have been a masterpiece, but I get the feeling Eidos M catered to the classic "simplicity" I see with many games nowadays, much like how Diablo 3 was severely watered down (and still is, but recent patches and the expansion at least have made it enjoyable) with the removal of the skill tree replaced with simply combining different spells, that sort of thing.\n\nOverall, Thief is a slightly above fair game. It's creativity, atmosphere, and progression system is heavily overshadowed by a one path, one solution, do it or don't play sort of feeling that haunts you chapter to chapter. Had this game had the same level design of the first ones, this could have been a highly anticipated reboot that I could have said was better than Thief 3. Thief 3 is still better than this game and it's shocking to say that considering you can do so much more in the reboot, but Thief 3 had more to explore and more ways to tackle things despite being as claustraphobic as it was at points. Newcomers, give it a shot I suppose, but play Thief 1 or 2 for true experiences. Thief fans like me, get ready for a big disappointment.\n\n6 out of 10","June 15, 2015","false","8.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

As a long running fan of the Thief series I was very excited for this game, and it left me feeling a little mixed. The game seems to take place several years after Deadly Shadows and while that isn't a bad thing, they seem to use it as an excuse to discard a LOT of the Thief series staples...pagans, keepers, hammerites only got the subtlest of nods, nobody uses Taffer anymore, though it is mentioned oddly, elemental crystals are gone for seemingly no reason and Garret isn't quite the cynical anti-hero he originally was; he openly elects to be the hero this time around which is stupid; all to save his new spunky girl sidekick!....it actually hurt me to type that. The plot is ehhh.. at best and they forgot Garret's mechanical eye. Just as weird they went about bringing up a lot of other things..Basso from Thief 2 returns, they even recall his marriage, you actually stumble into Keeper ruins once or twice they even give a nod to insane widow Moira in the form of a chapter Moira's Asylym. In short from a Lore standpoint, they wrecked this game in the most puzzling of manners.\n\nGameplay is another issue however. Disregarding the mauled lore, the game is actually a lot of fun to play. The levels are of good size, not nearly as sprawling as classic Thief levels but certainly a dramatic improvement over Deadly Shadows small spaces, with multiple points of entry and progression such as the game demands. The downside is this game actually features points of no return; which is baffling. A game that is heavily about exploration actually has points where you can't backtrack from....really at a loss for words there other the quick-save is your friend. The City itself is open to exploration again like in Deadly Shadows, but unlike Deadly Shadows it's actually awesome! The City is large, gloomy, tightly-knit with a plethora of doors and windows you can break into, rooftops to explore, and all sorts of hidden nooks and crannies. Inbetween chapters you can pick up simple thief missions that take you around the city to find and steal various trinkets as well as whole, albeit small, individual chapters in the form of client jobs. A nice touch as well is you're able to go back and replay any chapter you just played without needing to load an old save to do so in case you want to try again or missed some loot. They did this aspect at least very well.\n\nIn the end if you're new to the Thief series and looking to try your hand at stealth games, I imagine you'll find this one a lot of fun. If you're a Thief veteran you'll be very disappointed in the butchering of the lore, almost as if they basically said they don't care, but you'll still find a lot of enjoyment in the gameplay despite it's few hiccups in that regard. It's fun but it's no Metal Age.","June 6, 2014","true","34.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However like most games, it has pros as well as cons. Allow me to summarise the pros and cons of this game.\n\nPROS:\n+ Beautiful Visuals on high graphical settings\n+ Fun to Steal valuables and random items\n+ Free-roaming around The City's "Open world"\n+ Able to break into people houses throughout The CIty\n+ Many optional content such as side missions, client jobs and challenge maps\n+ A Suprisingly Scary Mission\n+ Great voice acting by Garrett the main character\n\nCONS:\n- Confusing and horrible Map Design\n- Only Three kind of enemy types (Sword guy, archer guy and monster)\n- Limited character models, hence most NPC look like the same person\n- The small cast of Characters in this game are boring and you would most likely not care about them\n- Boring plot and story\n\nIf I have to rate this game, I'll give it a 6/10 which is a decently average game.\n\n\nThe best aspect of this game would be the stealing! Somehow, stealing stuff in this game gave me enjoyment.\n\nThe worst aspect of the game would be the map design which is really bad. I got lost several time in the open world city as the map was too basic and has nothing much on it to guide you around.\n\nOverall, the game is still pretty fun to play despite it's flaws.

The brothel was okay in some ways but the Architect manor... the only thing i knew about it it was that it was built by the architect himself ( i heard a guard saying this as i entred the level) but inside there were empty rooms all over. i can't posibly belive that the only inhabitants were him, his wife ane 20 guards and maids. after looking in all the identical rooms i found a woman with a necklace looking at the wall and another doing something to the bed, i could wait forever and they wouldn't move. That's how the NPC's feel. Souless puppets. The city has no story, every building is empty , almost nobody on streets. and the level design was hideous. You give me a direction but only 1-2 ways of getting to it. and except the brothel where i could make everyone to sleep with the opium machine i couldm't find anything similar in the rest of the game. the city is full of empty houses that look the same.Taking the loot doesen't give any satistfaction. every time i played i wanted to see dishonored level of story telling.\n\nPros:\nThe engine is Perfect\nGarret Voice is perfect\nGraphics are perfect\nOptimization is very good\n\nCons:\nVery good story but bad executation.

The first part is very similar to Dishonored but then it's like the writers decided to change course halfway and instead of a plague infected city you have a thing called primal that got into a girl's body and made her create the gloom and blind faceless naked monster (wtf?). Then there was a scene at an asylum totally out of character for this game and that aspect could have been better explored because it was the most interesting part for me (phantoms, loonies, hidden cashes, and an overral good story). But then it was over and back we go to stealling all the things.  I also have to complain about the map, it's horrid, takes 20m to get to a place. Honestly there were parts I enjoyed like the client jobs but it was a bother to go an get them because of the stupid map.\n\nI could have given this game a higher rating if it wasn't for the ending - absurd as it was not to mention rushed as hell.\nAnyway, wasn't expecting more from a 4,00 EUR game.

The brothel was okay in some ways but the Architect manor... the only thing i knew about it it was that it was built by the architect himself ( i heard a guard saying this as i entred the level) but inside there were empty rooms all over. i can't posibly belive that the only inhabitants were him, his wife ane 20 guards and maids. after looking in all the identical rooms i found a woman with a necklace looking at the wall and another doing something to the bed, i could wait forever and they wouldn't move. That's how the NPC's feel. Souless puppets. The city has no story, every building is empty , almost nobody on streets. and the level design was hideous. You give me a direction but only 1-2 ways of getting to it. and except the brothel where i could make everyone to sleep with the opium machine i couldm't find anything similar in the rest of the game. the city is full of empty houses that look the same.Taking the loot doesen't give any satistfaction. every time i played i wanted to see dishonored level of story telling.\n\nPros:\nThe engine is Perfect\nGarret Voice is perfect\nGraphics are perfect\nOptimization is very good\n\nCons:\nVery good story but bad executation. It has a start and an end but a bland middle.\nSouless NPC's\nGuards have the exactly same route\nLocations got no stories\nLoot doesen't give any satisfaction\n\nConclusion: The engine is perfect but the level design and city life and story are almost non existent.\nKeep Garret, keep the engine, fire the writters.","February 27, 2015","true","21.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KaziuGaming/recommended/239160/","KaziuGaming","Ophidian93","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KaziuGaming/","438 products in account","My feelings towards the new Thief are complicated. I'm probably going to post an unpopular opinion.\n\nAnd that opinion is: Thief 2014, on its own, is a good game.\n\nI'm saying 'on its own', because if you bought it expecting to relive the memories of Thief games of old, you'll be sorely disappointed. Exploration, while interesting, doesn't offer nearly as much choices as the classic games. Levels are not as sprawling and intricately designed. The ambient music is just a shadow of Eric Brosius' masterpieces. No Stephen Russell. Also, you can't jump non-contextually. You can only shoot rope arrows at designated spots. Which sucks.\n\nHowever, please hear me here: you need to look at Thief 2014 as a game completely of its own. It is a reboot, after all, not a sequel. (Even though it's filled to the brim with nice shout-outs to the classics + I'm pretty sure it is actually set in the same continuity). And the truth is, when seen without the prism of its predecessors, it's a very decent game. Graphics are very good and pleasingly gritty - even though they take a while to load - and The City feels deliciously grimdarky. And I actually liked the new Garrett very much; he's just as witty and darkly humorous as the Garrett we knew. Plus, let's not forget what the main source of fun in Thief has always been: stealing! This game managed to appease my inner cleptomaniac completely; looting feels fun and satisfying.\n\nSo, all in all, give Thief 2014 a shot, especially if you haven't played the classic ones (maybe you'll come to appreciate them afterwards). Think of it as Dishonored without Blink. It's a very fun bit of obsessive-compulsive stealing that should keep you occupied until we get a new, better stealth game. Until then, I give Thief a solid 7/10.\n\nPS. By the way, if you feel that this game has been 'dumbed down' and made 'too easy' in comparison to the classic Thief... There is an option to play with a completely custom difficulty setting. You can make the game literally harder than hard. Like, Super Meat Thief level hard.","March 18, 2015","true","28.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Stealth is the key to all of your actions, as you are a very weak combatant when exposed. The game focuses on what a thief does, stealing items of worth for his own gain. So if you like looting and looking for loot, especially the well hidden sort, Thief offers plenty of this.\nThe main story is supported by nicely animated cutscenes and very good voice acting, even in the german version. Like Deus Ex this is clearly one of Square Enix' strengths. Levels are well designed and you usually have more than two ways to deal with obstacles.\nMy only real problem with the actual gameplay is that you don't have many options to deal with actual enemies. Garrett has a form of "magic" which is called focus, but it is barely any more than passive buffs which enhance your abilities, like slowing the time or extending shadows. In most cases you are limited to a hide and seek gameplay with the options of distracting, killing or knocking out enemies but nothing more. Dishonored, for comparison, offers a wide variety of "magic" abilities and tools to help you overcome your foes.\nThat said, what Thief does, it does it pretty well and it's a nice looker on top.\nI had some performance issues with strange loading stutters, but apart from that it runs well on my old machine even on very high settings. So I guess even older machines can play it well, if you tune the options a bit.\nGrab this game if you like the atmosphere, which it really practically radiates, if you like stealth gameplay and stealing stuff.","March 21, 2015","true","29.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However like most games, it has pros as well as cons. Allow me to summarise the pros and cons of this game.\n\nPROS:\n+ Beautiful Visuals on high graphical settings\n+ Fun to Steal valuables and random items\n+ Free-roaming around The City's "Open world"\n+ Able to break into people houses throughout The CIty\n+ Many optional content such as side missions, client jobs and challenge maps\n+ A Suprisingly Scary Mission\n+ Great voice acting by Garrett the main character\n\nCONS:\n- Confusing and horrible Map Design\n- Only Three kind of enemy types (Sword guy, archer guy and monster)\n- Limited character models, hence most NPC look like the same person\n- The small cast of Characters in this game are boring and you would most likely not care about them\n- Boring plot and story\n\nIf I have to rate this game, I'll give it a 6/10 which is a decently average game.\n\n\nThe best aspect of this game would be the stealing! Somehow, stealing stuff in this game gave me enjoyment.\n\nThe worst aspect of the game would be the map design which is really bad. I got lost several time in the open world city as the map was too basic and has nothing much on it to guide you around.\n\nOverall, the game is still pretty fun to play despite it's flaws.

So 50 bucks for 10 hours is not really worth it for me.\n\nWhy did I recommend it? Scroll down to the bold text. :D\n\n-Spoilers up ahead-\n\nI like the thief franchise but I would not really put it under that name.\nPlaying the first few chapters you get the feeling this might become an okay game but around the third chapter you kind of start giving up on it. Specially when Zombie/Falmer/Weeper guys start appearing with a super lame and poor explanation of how they came to be.\nIt was really confusing for me since it feld like they didn't quite know what type of game they wanted it to be. Sometimes I felt like it wanted to be a stealth type game then it felt like it wanted to be pure action..suddenly it tries to be a really weird horror game with mentioned above Falmer type creatures that might have been taken from Skyrim.\n\nI do know that people who developed Dishonored also worked with Thief before and I don't know if the storylines from both games were created simultaneously but I got to be honest..\n\nThief has Gloom and Dishonored had the rat plague\nThief has Freaks and Dishonored had the Weepers\nThief has the Blind Begger Queen and Dishonored had Granny Rags\nThief had Erin taken away but guiding you through the world Dishonored had the Empress and later the heart\nThief takes you to the Primal World in Dishonored you were taken into the Void\nThief has the Thief Taker General and Dishonored had Slackjaw - both resembling Bill the Butcher from Gangs of New York.\n\nIts not always entirely the same in the way they act of function but it is quite close.\nI have to say I played Dishonored for hours and hours and I could continue doing so but with Thief that is not the case.\n\nThe chapters were fast, linear and the guards had a really bad AI.\n\n\nNon the less it was an okay game just not worth that amount of money. So I will give it recommendation if you:\n- Get it when its on sale\n- and don't expect a game that feels like one of the Thief ones.\n\nIf you don't expect that and you only pay..let's say 20 bucks.. it's a game you can enjoy for a little bit while you have a few hours time\n\n(edit: did some formatting)","March 2, 2014","true","15.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Yes it's not really a successor to the original and acclaimed thief series.\nThe product is a console-player-streamlined dishonored-like without superpowers.\nMovement is restricted: jumping/climbing only where possible and also rope arrows can't be fired in any wood but assigned places (to not make it too difficult for kids). You can't place crates to create shortcuts, reach ledges or hide. You can't throw stuff to distract only the bottles designed for that purpose.\nGareth the cynical thief we loved becomes Gareth the emo dude with a mean GF but it's not that bad as I made it sound. (in fact in reviews the Erin character was usually reviled - she casually murders a guard in the beginning - but I think given her history and everything the character works and as you discover in the game the guards are a bunch of fascists anyway)\n\nNow why the recommendation?\nOn it's own without the mighty thief series as comparison the game is a quiet good simulation of sneaking, stealing stuff and parcour. Aside from game design, bugs and handling problems the game shows AAA production values. For 10 bucks it's good entertainment.\nFor all the reasons outlined Dishonored feels like a much better production and was dubbed the spiritual thief successor (has Trickster, more steampunk and style) but Corvo is an overpowered killing machine who always has several ways to easily dispatch stuff while Gareth remains a fragile dude who has to strike from the shadows and he's a much better sneak at it. It's a different approach and also very satisfying to play.\nApproaching the last mission now and the game hits the sweet spot between being the badass takedown sneaker and the close combat wimp.\nYou'll have a lot of exciting moments where you escape detection by a hair.\nIt's fun to nail an arrow through a guard's eye from the shadows.\nGood lot of content with large main missions and several smaller 15 minute side missions.\nBunch of rare collectables and secret treasure hidden in every corner.\n\n\nOther unsorted impressions and rants\n\nAtmosphere is dark and gothic. I like the visual style and the game characters actually. Voice-acting ranges from poor to good. New Gareth is not old Gareth of legend but an ok dude for a hero.\nMission 5 is the thief-obligatory horror mission.\nWhile the story is usual an excuse to steal stuff and go see places it's especially illogical and obscure here and the ending is just dumb and unrewarding.\nThere are no hammerites or pagans anymore.\nAmbient conversations are projected on your position without any speaker existing - making it appear like you hear ghost voices in your head as noises and conversations from guards are correctly coming from their position.\nOh and often you're supposed to mash some button like to pry a  window. Completely useless feature in a game - should be patched out from ANY game (Batman games come to mind). Ruins your gear so you buy another overpriced controller.\nClumsy "context sensitive controls" - you probably lean on a chest more often than loot it or fumble with controls while avoiding guards in pursuit.","February 8, 2015","true","27.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

They couldn't do what they need to do becuase Squaresoft rushed em.

I liked The City's ambient, photography and music. But that really is all that will keep you from giving up on the game. The main reason for this is that the story is so boring. The first games had excellent and somewhat funny dialogues, along with factions such as the Hammerites and the Pagans that gave such depth to the original games. And I was expecting to encounter them again in this game, but they were not included because this game is set several decades after the first 3 games. So, obviously, Garrett is not the same person, but a "descendant". But the Garrett in this game is not at all engaging and one reason for that is its monotonous voice acting. It is fun to play but it is not as engaging as Dishonored, for example. Tomb Raider, made by the same studio, is a fine example of an excellent reboot. Thief, on the other hand, left me disappointed as a reboot and does not make me excited for the next Thief installment. Still, I recommend you to play this game because there is such a draught on stealth-based games nowadays.","November 29, 2015","true","27.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The severely intricated city, which is the mission hub, is the soul of the game.\nOptional client jobs, secondary missions and break-ins are the way to actually feel the thief essence: this is a game to be explored, as every corner can hide a lever or a secret passage, and information gathering is crucial.\nGame mechanics are not perfectly refined as in Dishonored, and the sound (which is of good quality) is affected by some bugs, but the sense of realism and immersion in the atmosphere of Thief is deep and catching.\n\n88/100\n\nFor a more faithful stealth gaming experience I suggest to switch on the no-kill and no-detection modes, as the game provides unlimited quicksaves.","January 5","true","42.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The AI is wonky and the levels are not as open as promised. A perfect example is the moment I had to jump out of an air vent with a guard walking underneath it - I figured I waited a while until he was gone. However, when he was gone, I wasn't able to jump out of the air vent. After minutes of trying everything I figured out that you have to perform a takedown on the guard (which triggers a cutscene) to advance. Perfectly sums up how linear this game can be - performing takedowns is definitely NOT the first thing I think about in a stealth game.\n\nHowever, the atmosphere is grim, and the possibilities to set yourself a challenge before you start the game are endless - there are more than enough options to make the challenge satisfying for the most hardcore Thief fans. Furthermore, the sneaking system is praiseworthy. Where Dishonored allows you to defend yourself with weapons and supernatural powers, Thief basically forces you to stay in the shadows - if you are detected, the only solution you actually have is making a run for it.\n\nThief is a good reboot, but not a worthy one. Eidos Montreal could have done so much better, especially on the gameplay and dialogues, but really excelled on creating a City that gives you the shivers. The difficulty settings are clearly a nod to the fact that Thief is a cult classic and has a fanbase of hardcore stealth fans, but is has also been made accessible for new players who want to be introduced into this wonderful series. Hopefully Eidos Montreal will learn from their mistakes when they decide to make a sequel, and make a game that gives us back the Thief series as we know it.\n","March 1, 2014","true","10.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

For one, it has none Guard interaction we saw in the other Thief games that we all found so endearing. No Taffer talk or anything. WTF happened to Benny? Benny was funny and gave the game much needed humor.  All we get with this game is a lot of 'Sloop' and 'Polly Adler' talk. "Oh my back aches," "I think I'm coming down with something," "I hope I don't catch the gloom..." Holy crap, gimme a break!\nI have a good machine but I rarely have had as many glitches with game like this. Crash crash and crash again. I shoot a rope arrow, the rope uncoils - crash! Or while moving, the games freezes then crash! I'll exit a building, the game chuggs along like molassas in winter and slowly warms up to semi-normal speed and maybe or maybe I'll get a crash.\nSome of the cut-scenes went into fast forward mode like an old VHS tape; but yet the voices didn't. And other times, Garret would talk over himself. I'd get two script lines running at the same time. Or some NPC's would spout the same lines in near unison. In other words, this game has lots-o-bugs. Never saw this with Deus Ex: HR. It was evident that the team that gave this game a reboot had never played any of the other Thief games. If they had, this game would've been much much better.

The city and story or great and the city tells most of it as a proper Thief game should, so why do I not recommend this game? because it isn't optimized at all, my graphics card which is pretty good chugs like bloody Steam boat willie, I'm running with every thing on low and only textures on medium and it can take a solid minute per area to get the game to load properly so there's no lag. The map design is horrendous it's extremly confusing and once you hit the second area and more of the map you feel completely upside down, as the map isnt clear at all and the quests don't tell you how to get around.\nThe economy jips you at every corner, you'll get something like 40 gold from a room and the rope arrow to get up there costed 75 gold coins, the whole wire cutters, grate opener and painting cutter thing is complete bull ♥♥♥♥, I mean what? Garrett I know you're a master Thief and we took out the proposed skill tree and Quick Time Events because the fan base was going to gut us but yea you don't have all the tools a Thief needs, also remember your mechanic eye? nope now you got a ♥♥♥♥ing magic one. Where was it in the first game? who cares! the magic eye skill tree is completely stupid, and after a while just removes any challenge from the game. the actual campaign maps are fun, they really are but the majority of side missions suck ♥♥♥, really hard. you no longer get free control of where your arrows go most of the time, you can only use rope arrows where the game says to use them and many other forms of control that you are used to having in Thief games is completely taken away from you, Garretts fun dialog is still there, the guards are still as story driving as the acutal story ( which is a great thing btw) but damn this game is not only a let down, it just pisses you off for how alien it is compared to the source material, where it had freedom, this gives you bird seed paths all towards the same ending.\n\n\nPs. where thief 2 had large open maps where you could do anything with and then leave, these maps have very few ways of getting in, and are very structured. don't let it fool you, there is a set path and it has like 2 branches that's it. some parts have no branches it's just a set path.\nThis game is just crap, if you don't mind some older graphics, but want the best game I've ever played in every category ever and really awesome creepy as all ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ religious robots check out Thief 2, the metal age.\n\nThief- 4/10 (2014)\nThief 2- 10/10\n\nThief 2 > Thief (2014)","June 6, 2014","false","8.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

To be successful, it is vital for it not to look bad in comparison.\nDesigners bore that in mind. Almost every aspect of game has evolved.\nGameplay has been balanced, and now you cannot grab things instantly and without moving. Light gem mechanic was simplified, now containing only three distinct states (at first I was quite dissatisfied with this, though, as I saw later, it did not harm gameplay complexity). Imbalanced wall-flattening was removed, replaced by fixed location hiding places - empty closets. Focus feature introduction made gameplay more smooth, it is almost impossible to get stuck now (and, because Focus resource is quite limited, it was achieved without significant complexity loss). Ghost-Opportunist-Predator rankings is great and encourages rich non-linear gameplay. Combat is more dynamic and now, with proper player skill, Garrett poses real threat in one-on-one combat.\nArt is just great. Models, textures, sounds - everything is beyond expectations. I do not value these things much, so cannot tell deep detail, but even I can see work well done.\n\nStill, as you can see, I do not recommend this game. In evaluating Thief I, like many others, compare it to Deadly Shadows. But from my point of view, Thief loses the match with a huge score gap. This is because the things I liked in Deadly Shadows the most were the atmosphere, the story and characters who acted in it.\nIn Thief, there is only one lively character for the whole game. It could be fine with a thieving game if it was protagonist. But no, it is a fence, Basso. To add insult to injury, Basso does practically nothing in whole storyline. Beside some quest-giving in beginning of game, his only appearance is in chapter four, where Garret has to rescue him from prison (a princess in tower could be there instead of Basso with no impact on the narrative). With no bright characters there is no bright story.\nAtmosphere is ruined. Introducing collectible sets is the most dubious thing, it turns Garret from cold-blooded and cold-minded thief into some short-sighted kleptomaniac, who stashes valuables worth thousands of coins in dirty destroyed clock tower for some unknown reasons.\nRemember brilliant mission in Shalebridge Cradle? Compare atmosphere in Cradle and in Moira Asylum. Compare mission narratives. Double facepalm is not enough to describe a feeling when you see a crude fake copied from masterpiece. This mission just should not have been added to the story. It looks worthless for those who played Deadly Shadows and loved it.\nAll strong ideologies in the City are dead and this is explicitly shown to us: Keeper Library and Hammer Cathedral are abandoned and there is no trace of their inhabitants. Designers burned with desire to destroy the City as player remembers it, and this desire provoked blunders. Abandoned buildings look like they were abandoned for centuries, not for decades, with no rational explanation for that scope of destruction. The City is dead and agonizing, with no purpose to exist, which impacts on playing experience in form of question 'Why should I care and try to save it?' In urge to destroy, nothing was proposed in return. Designers performed just like Orion's revolutionaries - they kill all guards, set city on fire and then... nothing. It just stays burning forever, until you finally close Thief to never run it again.\nGreatest forces you encounter are just some power-hungry feudal lords. Remember how exciting was first mission in Deadly Shadows, in Rutherford Castle, reading about all of those intrigues they were plotting against each other? And how worthless they all started to look when Keepers, Hammers and Pagans stepped on the stage? On day four or five you would not even remember that there are some 'Great Families' and that they mean anything in the City.\nNothing like that anymore. You just stick to all those nobles' dirty underwear. No big ideas. Only realpolitik, only hardcore.\nHaving read all above, you should understand why the story is primitive and predictable (and quite secondary too - revolution line looks like another crude fake copied from masterpiece - this time Dishonored).\nThief is another unfortunate example of a game that was created with huge budget and effort of specialists, but without aim to be a piece of art. It is good for killing time, but there is nothing truly beautiful in it. Just business.\nDo not have any illusions - it will not 'unfold in the end' like Bioshock Infinite. It will just fade away, leaving only one word afterwards.\nDisappointment.","June 27, 2014","false","101.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Giant sprawling complex levels made Thief I/II incredibly fun, now they are tiny rail roads where you can probably close your eyes, hold W, and clear a few missions.\n\n3.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stallionfree/recommended/239160/","stallionfree","Stallion Free","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stallionfree/","384 products in account","I recently finished this game on the hardest difficulty with all side content complete. Here are my thoughts:\n\nWhat I Liked:\n-The customizeable difficulty was a really cool idea and I enjoyed shooting for the 700 point challenge. Basically the game lets you pick a base difficulty and then set a ton of modifiers worth varying levels of points. My settings forced a game over if I was seen or touched anyone and I enjoyed having the option to do that.\n-The game is completely ghostable and it doesn't rely on abusing AI patterns or using glitches. Careful observation and exploration allow for some really useful alternate approaches similar to Dishonored. I was able to able to ghost (despite what the broken post-mission rating said) every single main mission and every single sidequest in the game on the hardest difficulty so props to the devs for allowing for that.\n-The swoop mechanic is a joy to use. It is incredibly handy for crossing those small gaps between the darkness when you can't take out the light or ducking back into a corner after swiping some loot while a guard's back was turned. The animation and sound effect give it this nice agile feel and it's hard not to feel like a pro thief every time you use it.\n-I really liked that the best loot was tied to exploration-based puzzles. It was fun picking through documents to find clues for vault codes or searching for ways to disable traps. The sidequests really take advantage of this and some of the later ones feel quite clever.\n-Thiefing in general was fun. Pickpocketing has a nice feel to it. It's risky, but not overly hard. Picking locks is simple, but trying to do it before a patrol returns can be quite tense. The animation for cutting paintings out of their frames is superb.\n-The full body-awareness is nice. I love all the intricate first-person animation (though a couple get old fast) and seeing your legs is always a plus.\n-The devs didn't skimp on content either. The game took me roughly 20 hours to see all the content. The Client side missions are definitely worth checking out as they take place in areas separate from the hub and are pretty involved, taking anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour.\n\nWhat I Accepted:\n-The AI is consistent and reads pretty well from the player standpoint which I think is the most important aspect of designing AI for stealth games. They aren't terribly clever, but they do feel like a threat.\n-The art is solid. The visual variety is a bit lacking, but the style they went for works well with the theme and the character design is pleasant. Dishonored definitely takes the cake here, but Thief isn't without it's merits.\n-The non-stealth segments are a bit goofy, but they make up a miniscule percentage of the game. The bridge sequence was actually pretty cool as a visual setpiece and it wasn't as jarring as the previous one had been.\n-The third-person platforming stuff could have been used a lot more than it was. There were only 3-4 actual implementations of it and most of them were just there as the only way to reach a new area. I wish they had used this system to add more verticality to levels.\n\nWhat I Disliked:\n-The blatant streaming-in-the-new-area animations were really annoying. There are 2-3 of them that get used for the whole game and I would honestly have preferred a loadscreen if we have to compensate for ♥♥♥♥♥ier platforms. By the end of the game you never want to pry open another window for the rest of your life.\n-The story execution is pretty terrible. The plot is poorly explained and important characters will show up like twice over the course of the 15-20 hour game. When I reached the end I was completely lost on why they even bothered. It's ridiculous and nonsensical.\n-The sidequest organization in the city gets really old by the end due to the lack of fast travel. I would probably recommend just letting everything sit till the point of no return and then do it all then because if you do them as they become available you will be crossing the city back and forth twenty or so times. It gets really ♥♥♥♥ing old when you are ghosting the game and are creeping past the same guards for the tenth time.\n-The game has a very stitched-together feel and the troubled development is obvious when playing. There are a couple segments that you can tell the guys who were trying to save the game couldn't do anything about short of completely redoing them, which wasn't an option after 5+ years of pre-existing dev time. It's a bummer.\n-The pre-order bonus is one of the best missions in the game. It's a really well-fleshed out side mission where you rob a bank that has multiple levels of security. It was really fun and it bothered me that most of the people playing the game down the road probably won't be playing it.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you hold the first two games sacred, don't bother with this entry. This game is not for you and you will be wasting your time and money. No one is asking for you to do community service and torture yourself with it. If you liked Dishonored a lot though, Thief 2014 might be worth checking out at the 15$ or less price range and you can pretend it's a spin-off from that series, because let's be honest, that is what the game feels like.","March 16, 2014","false","25.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Square and Eidos-Montreal did a good job, but not enough to bypass the originality, artistic beauty and emotional investment you can experience by playing Dishonored and its DLC (which I highly recommend) or the first three Thief games (the first two really, with the third as a neat tidy-up of the series).  That doesn't mean that this Thief is bad however; it is very good at times, but it's not a $60 game. It's a $30 game at best.\n\nSome observations.\n#1. The game is a graphics hog for no reason, leading to lots of texture popping.\n#2. Unfinished artwork/bad artwork: Unreadable posters; and a painter's house had house painting brushes that looked like they came from  modern hardware store. It was like a programmer cut and pasted in an ad image.\n#3. Uninspiring dialogue and cut-scene lipsyncing and audio drop problems.\n#4. A story that stmbles at times, but does manage to build nicely only to fall apart in the very last quicktime scene as being almost as non-sensical as the end of ME3.\n#5. NPC character models look alike and act lifeless via repetitive and non-varied animations. However, the dialogue heard through walls and windows is very good, interesting and life like.\n#6. The Queen of Beggars is a discount version of Granny Rags from Dishonored.\n#7. Basso is perfectly rendered, written and voice acted. He's exactly as I pictured him --better even. But even he seems slightly derivitive of the bus driver/gun dealer from Borderlands.\n#8. Sadly, Garrett is now a trout-shouldered French emo goth. He just doesn't look good. Also, he is now a man with two different colored eyes... and that's all for that. No reference to his mechanical eye. But on a positive note, the programmers at least kept him looking consistent throughout the game unlike in T3.\n#9. The villain thief catcher general is that butcher dude from Gangs of New York; he even wields a cleaver during one scene.\n#10. The City is beautifully depressing, but I find it difficult to believe that a religion as well-established as the Hammerites would simply just disappear in a decade. Economically and politically they are simply too strong to just be gone. The same goes for the Pagans.\n#11. A big plus for Garrett mentioning the Trickster at one point and evidence of the Hammerites having once existed is evident in the game at times. Even the influence of the Mechanists is stil evident. However, it also seems as though the lead writer and the other writers couldn't make up their minds. Thief lore is used as stage props that no one seems to know or understand well enough to use them effectively.\n#12. Garret's equipment gets a plus and a minus. The rope arrow is back, but now it can only be used in certain areas. The gas arrow doesn't knock people out anymore. Likewise, there's no sap. But... the claw is a great new addition. Creating a new item and having it fit so well into the lore of the game is a big plus, so good job there.\n\nOverall I'd say buy this game on sale. It is good. And if you do, some advice: Accept all of Basso's extra missions when he offers them so you won't have to keep going back to him, and then do them at your liesure throughout the game.","June 21, 2014","true","25.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
