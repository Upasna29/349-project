Like most MMOs you are to kill X amount of this and return.\n-There is no open world, there might be later on? Each map/stage you click to join and offers maybe 5 minutes of simple game play till you get to the end and teleport to town or the next map.\n-After you complete the simple maps you can be prompted to buy ingame items to make yourself stronger for $4.99, I clicked buy to see what happens and it tells me "This is not available in beta"\n-There is ingame currency gold, crystals and gems, each you can spend real money to obtain or very slowly by playing of course.\n\nI don't expect the game to get much better. There are plenty of F2P games out there that you could find more enjoyment with.","December 21, 2015","false","0.7"," 47 of 58 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","47","58","6","3"

The combat is basically managing your groups health bars with potions and drops from killing mobs along with using scrolls. I saw that because the character will auto-attack anything near you regardless of whether you press any buttons leaving very little thoght except when to use your special abilities. I attempted the multiplayer part but did not get very far and there were not many people on to play with. The single player objectives are easy, kill as much as you can to progress.\n\nThe reason I am saying no to this game is very simple. At every turn I had something in my face telling me to by items from their cash shop. "Special item x in sale for only $4.99!" 'Get item y now down to $2.99 today only!" Many games have cash shops, which is fine. However this game throws it in your face every chance it gets.\n\nThe game is simply not good enoughm not entertaining enough for me to justify the full force in your face cash shop this games uses.\n\nGameplay:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH6aFPzSFvk\n","December 22, 2015","false","0.9"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","18","23","2","0"

On one hand yes this is a very simple game that pretty much plays itself as others have mentioned. Fairly fun for one finger operation. This game is a mobile/touch inspired game but with very good KB+Mouse support. However, when will developers learn that the mobile microtransaction method fails on PC horribly. Mobile microtransaction fares quite differently than "made for PC" microtransaction games. Which I am now realising why after a month there are so little reviews. On the other hand I will say it is a good little time filler if you are on a work/lunch/recess break (whatever you do) but like most mobile games. I see in it's future, getting very repetitive. However, I am only 30 minutes into this game so. I will update the review when I have accumulated more time. I have also downloaded the game to iOS & Android so I can get more time into the game.","January 18","true","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
