At first glance simple, but terribly addictive. Climate graphics and music. It has many bugs but still has a huge potential.\nPros:\n- Enjoyable gameplay\n- Beautiful graphics\n- Climatic music\ncons:\n- Lack of plot\n- Could be more levels\n\nAs early access 7.5 / 10","May 4","true","3.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It has its drawbacks, it could be improved by about fighting the enemy or something. but makes up for graphics and general climate created. Besides it is a great relief from the AAA games.\nIf it comes to me, I recommend! Game worth its ;) wink 8/10","May 4","true","3.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"
