You have unlimited ammo, so you don't have to worry about finding new ammo on the map, you just auto-reload and keep shooting.\n\nI know there are a lot of games like this, but I haven't played tons of them, so I can't compare to a lot of other ones, but so far I like it more than Splatter and Nation Red.  Those games are probably deeper, but also have a steeper learning curve.  This one just lets you jump in and go.\n\nMy favorite enemy is the dudes with pencils stuck through them, and once they die, the pencil shoots out and can kill you if it hits you.  Okay, maybe it's just a spike, but it looks like a giant pencil to me.","September 7, 2015","true","7.6"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","13","17","2","0"

How the controller settings don't use the D-pad is beyond me. The game is as simple of a top-down shooter as you can get. There are no upgrades, but you can choose from a selected set of power-ups. There isn't much incentive to keep playing this game since there are only 6 levels, all of which are pretty similar (but have different goals). There are very few variety of enemies, guns, and grenades. It just feels like an unfinished game that is probably best suited as a 99 cent mobile game.","March 12","false","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/janusan89/recommended/381910/","janusan89","Archangel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/janusan89/","270 products in account","A nice and simplistic shooter with the possibility of customizing your power ups manually or randomly, with however a somewhat lack of weaponry. There are a good chunk of levels to choose from that don't excel in details but do the job done, while the enemies lack completely in variation and could've used some more detail.\n\nMy main gripe is the lack in weapons: only 3 primaries, 2 secondaries and 3 bombs. As much as I found the primaries acting differently, the rest seemed to work the same. I might be wrong but I just didn't feel they were different enough to make me notice.\n\nOverall I'd recommend it...but the price is a bit too high for the amount of content you get: it gets longer the more you survive so it can end in 2 minutes or 2 hours, depending if you want to beat your high score. It works fine and I'm glad I got it (it was a gift, so thanks pal!). It's good for wasting some minutes so, get it for what you see.","September 22, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

As far as quality goes, they really have sunk a lot of effort into this.  It doesn't *feel* like a unity game it feels more like an Xbox title or something.  I have only tried it solo, but I love games that have local co-op and this one immediately went on my 'need to try' list the next time my friends come over.\n\nAlmost no complaints, I only tried the arcade mode though but to be honest, if that was the only mode available this game would still be worth it.  Co-op and the campaign mode is just a bonus.\n\nReally looking forward to getting through those achievements.  Good job, guys.","September 4, 2015","true","4.1"," 15 of 33 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","15","33","0","0"

If you obvious that, Xenocide is what it is: a top-down shooter with zombies, waves and tons of bullets. It could totally fit as an arcade machine game.\n\nIt's true that with a  little bit more of graphical polish it could look way better and with some hours of a single-player mode, it could be a 6€ game. Despite so, being a game from a rookie indie developer team, it's fair enough, they made it.\n\nSo, to sum up: take it if you get it cheap or with a friend, because that's the way you'll take the most of Xenocide, by playing with games. If not, let it be and wait for the next game of these guys, pretty sure it'll  be way better.\n\nPeace.\n","September 3, 2015","true","2.0"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","0"

Could be made more complex with more weapons or upgrades, Great way to burn an hour or so as it is a great (co-op) party game. So from a F2P perspective it is fitting but unfortunately most the achievements require P2P elements of more time. But I managed to get some achievements and almost got on the highscores so can't knock it, thumbs up!","November 29, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
