Focusing on a single gameplay element which is cover based/run and gun third person shooting.\n\nThe cover system works like any other game as far as I could tell press a button to snap to cover, press the button or movement, the default button is C which is annoying you can change it in the config.\n\nThe shaky camera didn't both me, mosts of the time I liked it, if you don't you can also turn 'steadycam' on.\n\nThe story is dark and brutal, the proganists are prposely unlike scumbags and it's brillant because even when you die you're thinking the worlds probably better off without these guys anyway. It's one of the few games where you play the bad guy and it's fun.\n\ndon't let my logged game hours fool you, I've probably replayed 20-30 times\n\nPro's\n\ngraphics are still great\nstory is dark and intense\ngameplay is simple and fun\nruns on almost any machine from the last 4 -5 years\nThe first game is also awesome for all the same reasons\n\nCon's\n\nThe final level and ending is anti climatic\n\nLots of people gave bad reviews about it largely complaining about camera and control schemes than can easily be configured from the in game menu.\n\n\n","November 21, 2014","true","5.9"," 121 of 161 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","121","161","6","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/senshado/recommended/28000/","senshado","Homework Chavez - 70% finished","http://steamcommunity.com/id/senshado/","187 products in account","Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days is by far the hardest review I had to do. Not because it proved difficult to analyse or form an opinion of, but because it teases me with something that could have been great - yet is not. I don't like destroying a game I have a thing for, even though it's just on paper in the shape of a review, but there's no going around it. The franchise screams for a more flexible versatile game but instead I'm left with a repetitive hallway shooter.\n\nAdam 'Kane', as ex-mercenary, and James 'Lynch', as felon convicted of manslaughter, form a crime duo to arrange an arms deal in Shanghai. However, sh¡t hits the fan and Kane accidentally shoots the informant's girlfriend. Unfortunately she turns out to have been the daughter of some thé mobster in Shanghai all of China, whom is not fond of his daughter dying from a bullet Kane fired. The game follows our protagonists through Shanghai as this crime lord throws in everything at his disposal as a means of revenge, which is a lot. From local thug to police officer, a few military companies to several special forces, this guy has them all in his pocket and intends to use every man to kill Kane and Lynch.\n\nThere really is nothing wrong with the writing, and reading about Kane & Lynch (either of the two parts) will want to make you play the games. The protagonist duo have a background together (as portrayed in Kane & Lynch: Dead Men) which - coupled with their voice actors - look like cold hard m☮therfµckers. There's no other way to describe them. This is actually necessary to make their survival credible as far as the setting is concerned, and it does add up.\n\nThough what doesn't add up is everything around it, with the partial exception of screenwriting: since the fundamentals of Dog Days is its hallway shooter mechanic, there isn't much freedom for screenwriting to begin with. The scenarios are heavily constrained to these mechanics and it doesn't take long for an observant player to notice that the intended storyline doesn't carry over as strong as it could have with different mechanics. The attempt is very admirable however, as even though some scenes are incredibly violent, they never feel forced or out of place.\n\nThe graphical quality is above average, though the used shaders and camera movement prove to be rather annoying over time. The bobbing, lens flares and shaders look great when only observed, but when you are in control of the camera yourself it quickly feels as if the game consistently misinterprets movements. There are glitches involved as well, though this might have to do with the fact that Dog Days is an older game and my newer hardware might not render some things correctly.\n\nThe sounds are too diverse to criticize in general. On one hand there are flat unconvincing gunshots, average ambience and mediocre soundeffects. On the other hand there's the convincing gritty voices of Kane and Lynch. While dialogue is well dosed, a great majority of the game still consists of shooting and as such there is little the dialogue of Kane and Lynch can do to make the game sound better in overall.\n\nAll of these assets could be worked with if it weren't for the repetitive hallway shooter mechanics. All details aside, this game is mainly about sitting behind cover, shooting people that are also behind cover, and moving up through the predefined path. The entirety of the game is played like this while every now and then a cutscene plays. The motives behind these mechanics might have to do with the developers intending to reach maximum cinematic experience by constraining the player, but when a game starts to feel like something that can be played on an light-gun arcade cabinet - graphics aside - a lot of players are going to conclude the game is boring without ever finishing the first playthrough.\n\nAnd that's a shame because just the storyline, the strong characters being coupled with great voices, and the potential hidden in screenwriting makes this game a hidden gem. My conclusion is that it's definitely worth a play, Dog Days is truly different from a great majority of titles and a developer's second attempt to bring a franchise to life that is much more potent than the games are willing to show. While compelling story-wise, the gameplay itself will most likely bore you. In that regard it's funny how Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days is only three to four hours worth of playtime, because anything more would have been too much in its current form. Collectors will probably not mind putting down €10,- for this, and I would plead the same for gamers with a thing for mentionable titles. If you are on a tight budget and have no idea about what I'm trying to unveil with my review, then you wouldn't be able to appreciate the title(s) and it's best to stay away from the franchise.\n\nI'm clicking the thumbs up for this game here because as broken as it might be: I admire the story, characters and voices, three things I value. Someday I will try the first Kane & Lynch and I'm also hoping the scheduled movie isn't going to ruin the franchise even more.","May 3, 2014","true","4.8"," 51 of 59 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","51","59","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mathute/recommended/28000/","Mathute","Praise The Sun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mathute/","419 products in account","It's no masterpiece.  I believe we are all aware of this... But, to be honest, I didn't find it near as "awful" or "worst game ever" status as most "reviews" would make you believe.\n\nLet's start with one of the highlights: the scenery. Good god, this game looks the way a crime shooter game should look.  It's gray, it's shiny, it literally makes this the better-looking iteration of Shangai I've seen in a video game. The lighting in the game is very good as well. Yes, the "filmed with a phone" look can get tiring, but, honestly? I even got used to the running, which I believe it's what made most people sick with this particular aesthetic.\n\nSecond highlight: the sound design. No epic music, no rock and roll, just a superb ambient music soundtrack that helped making me feel the desperation these two scumbags go through in this game. Highly recommended soundtrack.\n\nOverall, the art direction in this game is superb. Regarding its flaws, this is something no one will take away from it.\n\nNow, the story:\n\nIt feels like Spec Ops: The Line without the twist. It servers its purpose, but nothing else. Now, the characters, we could argue all day long. No, they're not complex, and no, they're not even memorable, but I'm sure they don't want to be, either. They are both psychopats, there's no question about it. In the middle of a shootout you can listen Lynch trying not to lose control over himself, trying to count to ten, and by the end of the game, you can notice the paranoid feel over him. Now, Kane, he's no strange to being crazy. Most of the time he seems the more reasonable one, but there's a point where you can see he's not. Near the beginning of the game one random officer surrenders and asks you to please not kill him. While you consider sparing the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥´s life, Kane just comes in and kills him, and not a single frak is given. And if there's other debatable aspect on this game, is your partner's AI. Yes, he gets in the middle of the shooting because he's a friggin bullet sponge, but he PROTECTS you. More times that I can count I see an enemy shooting me from an angle I can't reach, and he takes care of him.\n\nSadly I can't say the same thing about the enemy's AI. They're dumb. And they're bullet sponges as well. I don't believe the shooting is THAT bad, because it even feels the way these two morons would shoot guns, but the hit detection on the enemies is crap. Sometimes you empty half a clip on the enemies, and not only a fully armored SWATlike, but enemies with a shirt and a short absorb the bullets like mofos. It's even funny that sometimes you shoot them instead of falling, it gives them a boost so they move to other place. Add to this that they spot you no matter what. By the second "stealth" section I ddn´t even bother and started shooting like hell.\n\nYet, I played through it with no regrets. There are a couple of levels that I actually enjoyed A LOT. Specially the last one you play as Lynch. That whole going through the crumbling building was great. Level design is a bit "off" (says the one who never designed a level in his life), but some mechanics, like destroyable cover and throwing fire extinguishers that knock enemies if you hit them in the head, are great. Speaking of the latter, the "shooting the whatever you just threw to make it explode" could have use some more polish. It's so random and impossible sometimes that when you are able to shoot something over 3 walls, it's ridiculous.\n\nA few bugs here and there could have frustrated me, but nothing too crazy. Haven't tried the co-op yet, though, so no idea of how it plays with a buddy.\n\nI got it for like 2 bucks, but I think it can even be worth up to $7 for singleplayer only. I wasn't sad when IO cancelled its 3rd installment back then, because I enjoyed Hitman: Absolution so much and loved they were going to focus on that, but now I do feel kind of sad. With better gameplay, it would've been the anti-shooter to hold the crown until Spec Ops came out.\n\nTL;DR: Play it, at least to enjoy the wonderful art direction.","October 14, 2014","true","4.4"," 62 of 78 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","62","78","0","1"

Your buddy is also naked and bleeding from numerous wounds all over his body. This is the crazy life of Kane and Lynch, gaming's most unlikable leading men; psychos who just can't stay out of trouble. With the original game failing to be a critical success, developer IO Interactive's sequel has a lot to prove.Without spoiling the plot of this sequel too much, Kane and Lynch bodge a job, resulting in the death of someone with connections to a huge criminal organisation in Shanghai. With an army of goons out for blood what follows is an often unpleasant tale of revenge, torture, murder and the ramblings of a psycho and his mate. This time around you play as Lynch, although the slightly less unhinged, but still more or less a psycho, Kane is always at your side.Dog Days is, at its core, a fairly simplistic cover-based third-person shooter. You can now hide behind objects by pressing a button, rather than the awkward auto cover system the original game employed, and the controls feel tighter too. Environments this time around have been designed to allow for better use of these basic mechanics.With enemies dropping guns and ammo all over the place, and a plentiful supply of explosive canisters and crates, you're never short of ways to dispose of foes.The duo's fairly brief murderous adventure is unquestionably full of intense shoot-outs, but memorable moments are few and far between. The naked scene alluded to at the start doesn't deliver anything new in terms of gameplay, but the events were shocking enough to make me feel a bit uneasy. Equally, a level set inside an office block under attack from a gunship is full of things being shot to pieces, but it still somehow lacks spectacle.Dingy levels merge into one rather depressing whole, with the various Shanghai environments doing little to sell the Chinese city as a hot tourist destination.Audio work is rather impressive, with the excellent voice acting paired superbly with ambient sounds from the city. Fire fights send bullets ricocheting through your surround sound speakers, while our heroes constantly bicker with each other. The lip synching could certainly have been better, but on the whole the performances of each virtual actor make a basic story very entertaining.Sadly very little is made of main protagonist Lynch's mental state. He's almost always shouting something that only an unhinged man would, but his unique characteristics don't translate into the gameplay.A rather unsatisfactory ending to the psychotic double act's ordeal sours things somewhat. I was left expecting the pair to return to the screen after the closing credits, but there was nothing of the sort.Co-op play, via split-screen or online, adds in an element of working together, but the only differences are enhanced flanking abilities and being able to revive your buddy if he's downed by enemy fire. Split-screen is also vastly inferior to online co-op.The campaign feels a few hours short, but you do get a very decent multiplayer component, with game modes that test your skill with weapons as much as they do your morals.Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days is a visually unique title, glossing over a fairly by the numbers third-person shooter. The deranged duo's return is worth experiencing and is far more accomplished than its predecessor, but the gameplay on offer still doesn't match the quality of the characters IO has created.","February 11, 2015","true","13.4"," 26 of 37 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","26","37","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/28000/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","THE DOWNLOW:\nKane & Lynch 2: Dog Days is another third person corridor shooter with cover mechanics.  It comprises of a single 11 mission campaign based on a fictional representation of Shanghai, China. The campaign can be played solo or with another player.  There are also three online coop and pvp player-modes: Fragile Alliance: free-for-all team-based robbery missions, Undercover Cop: FA w/ a hidden infiltrator twist and Cops & Robbers: Up to 6vs6 shootout and escape or die.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n+ A well established story in the mould of HEAT. Great if you loved the movie and want to play something akin to it.\n+ Take on the role of two great characters with striking personalities.\n+ Top-notch voice-overs which bring them to life. Compliments the action perfectly with some great dialogue.\n+ A very good selection of weapons provides decent variety in your play-style.  Limited to two weapons at any one time.\n+ Some great fast-paced action, gratifying kills and gory takedowns.\n+ The enemy A.I on the second hardest difficulty presents a great challenge if you are into hardcore shooters.  On the hardest difficulty it is even more of a ♥♥♥♥♥!\n\nTHE BAD:\n- Levels are linear and undynamic in content.  Once you play it through, follow-ups will be essentially the same.\n- On the hardest difficulty even being in cover doesnt necessarily mean you are safe!\n- Flaky keyboard controls means you can leave cover unexpectedly and die.  Moreso on highest difficulty.\n- Multiplayer needs at least 2vs2 players for FA & UC modes and 3vs3 for C&R.  Which is extremely difficult given that MP is virtually dead except for a few random players.  Moreso as some achievements require all players to have the Doggie Bag (map) DLC.\n- Head-bobbing together with a bad camera angle may make you travel-sick, when running!\n- Experienced a few crashes in singleplayer.\n- MP can suffer from lag though I think this is a memory leak and just needs a game restart.\n- Online modes are hampered with a terrible graphical glitch that sometimes also requires a restart.\n- A problem with owners of the Doggie Bag DLC not being able to play a map was fixed in a patch.\n- Achievements cannot be 100%d because of one broken achievement.  'Harry Houdini' was likely broken in a botched patch after release.  Believe me I tested this substantially and was unable to trigger it!\n- Requires purchase of Doggie Bag DLC to get [nearly all] achievements.\n- You will need a very capable partner to complete the game at its highest difficulty.  Unless you are Chuck Norris. :)\n- I still dont know why they censored the gory details of dead bodies.... maybe a Germany thing!\n\nAND THE ORDINARY:\n* Levels are essentially enclosed areas with limited movement options.\n* Decent cover mechanics but limited tactical gameplay mostly centred on pinning and flanking, taking the high-ground, feinting, or flushing enemies out of cover.\n* Level design is basic with only the location setting changing between each one.\n* Enemies range between law enforcement(mainly cops) and other villians.  As usual health and weaponary are the only thing that really differenciates between them.\n* AAA graphics that were probably great at the time.  Look a little dated now but still very good.\n* The campaign is certainly replayable.  I finished it solo and then completed it on the hardest difficulty with another player. Campaign will take around 15-20 hours.\n* Longevity is focused on multi-player which is actually great fun but difficult to get enough players at the same time.\n\nVERDICT:\nKane & Lynch 2: Dog Days is a very capable third-person shooter.  It captures your interest with some very visceral gunfights.  Without doubt despite the repetitive nature of its gameplay, its replayable numerous times.  Even for someone who doesnt like MP/PvP, online sessions are very short and you dont lose anything but some time if you are defeated.\n\nI enjoyed playing this game. You will enjoy it too if you are a fan of the film HEAT, where this game generates a similar & familiar feeling.  If you prefer open-world games then maybe avoid it.  Also if you like to achieve 100% achievements and don't use SAM.  Just be warned that the camera angle and bobbing perspective isnt for everyone.

The story gets dark in terms of graphic violence very fast and never lets up. There are scene skips between waypoints I felt where the game was rushed and should have included transition pieces to make it flow smoother (such as a certain mission where you are trying to reunite with another group, reach the waypoint, then jumpcut to standing right next to them). Altogether the actual story portion was short and sweet, leaving a satisfactory feeling for about 4 hours of content. I did have 3 crashes in game and it was the game itself, no need to reset my computer or anything like that.\n\nI recommend playing it on easy or medium as the guns are mostly inaccurate, even when trying to fire single shots. You will often die to random headshots that cannot be controlled even when in cover on harder difficulties, so it will be mostly frustrating than tactical fun. Thankfully the camera angle can be changed on the fly, making it playable in certain environments like tight corners when the enemy has high firepower to potentially take you down fast.\n\nOnline Co-OP worked very well. Me and a friend had no issues joining each other's game for the story mode. I haven't tried the multiplayer version yet because I don't like game modes that reward antisocial behavior in a team. Since it is a game, there will be somebody that betrays the group and it puts unneeded pressure in completing objectives. If you have a group of friends who aren't D-bags, then give it a go, otherwise, be cautious.\n\nAfter beating this on normal difficulty and expert, I'll probably never touch this game again, but I had a great and memorable reaction to the story and recommend fans of dark and semi-realistic stories to try it when on sale.","March 4","true","7.9"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

Although graphics are nice and I salute the effort it must have taken to emulate the handy cam, this game is just half baked. The cover system is broken but above all, the aiming system is awful. You can unload clips on an enemy that is 5 feet away and spray your bullets all over without a single hit. However, the enemies have dead aim at 500 feet, killing you almost instantly and they can take 4-5 bullets in the head without dying. They can also shoot you accurately hitting 90% of their shots while blind shooting from cover. And I played on easy... You survive between 5 and 30 seconds and then restart over and over again until you get so frustrated that you just dump the stupid game. Kane & Lynch?

The recoil of the shoting in both games is pretty bad and even when you do hit the enemy it takes you alot of shot to kill them, even if the shot was an headshot. Also, each game is very short.

It's dark, gritty, and violent. Your two "protagonist" are nothing more than murderous scum  who you somehow root for. The action in this game is fantastic and it provides you with a fast paced third-person shooter.  Playing co-op makes it that much better. However, the multiplayer is without a doubt my favorite in any game. Fragile Alliance is what a heist game needs to do.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheEngiGuy/recommended/28000/","TheEngiGuy","TheEngiGuy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheEngiGuy/","437 products in account","TL;DR: generic gameplay, very short and repetitive singleplayer campaign, but stunning art direction, immersive audio, original multiplayer and two great protagonists. That said, if you are looking for a "so bad it's so good" game, go elsewhere.\n\nKane & Lynch 2 is one of those games that I consider "victims of the bandwagon" but also "wasted potential". It is about two violent, sociopathic anti-heroes reuniting each other after the disastrous events of the first game, trying to make a deal and be set for life, but always end up making a bad situation even worse.\nThe intro of the game presents you with protagonists' darkest trip: both are naked and a mysterious man are cutting their skins to pieces, shown through documentary-style camera work.\n\nThe neat thing about this game is the connection between sound effects and ambient music[forums.selectbutton.net] that blends nicely with Lynch's psychotic mind based on the situations in game.\nSure the game doesn't go well when compared to the first game, especially regarding the repetitive setting (streets and back alleys of Shangai at night time for the most part, unlike the first one with varying bank heists, nightclub shooting, skyscrapers, jungles...), and the storyline lasts for 5 hours, but gameplay and graphic wise it does better. I don't get this much negativity regarding gameplay, because it's mostly a generic third-person-shooter and I found the controls to be responsive enough and guns not 100% accurate (even though some shotguns are awkwardly more accurate than rifles at long range).\n\nThe storyline itself is ok, it has its moments (especially the Torture level) but some scenes feel forced. Sadly, the story starts to lose its charm halfway through, becoming generic... There are also complaints regarding lack of an ending: while that is true and I myself wanted to see a final cutscene instead of a "partial cliffhanger", the way I see it the storyline ends in the penultimate level, while the last level is simply "escape from everything".\n\nGraphics are generally good - with a lot of effects that simulate a videocamera - but needed some tweaks.\nAnother complaint from the people in general is the shaking camera when sprinting, but YOU CAN TURN IT OFF in the options. I personally have no problems with that since it adds with the men's bad moments.\n\nThe multiplayer is one-of-a-kind, but watch out for some netcode issues. You can still find Steam groups that organize regular multiplayer matches, like this one!\n\nDespite its flaws, flat storyline and the launch price being the same of an AAA title which helped decrease the game's reputation, it's still a solid game for the first playthrough. It can be compared to Spec Ops: The Line only because both have generic gameplay, but awesome experiences, with the only difference being that Kane & Lynch 2 does its best to be ugly and make you uncomfortable in a violent, deal-gone-wrong scenario.\nIn conclusion, the overall art style doesn't appeal to everyone. If you like dark and disturbing games, go for it.\n\nPersonal rating: 6.6/10","June 8, 2015","true","22.3"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","21","33","0","0"

So, now that the game is priced at 10€, I can say that it is more reasonable now.

The graphics are good (even for today's standards) and the soundtrack and the environment fit the game's dark tone perfectly.

There is a healthy dosage of shakicam, the screen has artifacting, the video lags when you are near explosions, and there are light streaks from very bright lights.\n\nUnfortunately, the problems this game has will make you forget those things. The shakicam is very disorienting, both during combat and when trying to figure out where to go (a strangely common problem in a linear cover shooter). Furthermore, the actual combat is too basic and the enemies don't really change besides what they are using. Lastly, all the automatic weapons have terrible recoil and spread, which makes the rifles and shotguns the weapons of choice.\n\nLastly, the game is short. It took my friend and I 3 hours to complete it on Medium.

As a result of this non-stop combat you do feel engaged in the game.\n+ Various parts of the environment are destructible, and become damaged amidst the firefights Kane and Lynch are involved in.\n\n\nNegatives:\n\n- The story is lacklustre in comparison to Kane and Lynch: Dead Men (the original). The characters themselves feel dull and the interesting aspects of their personality are absent in this game. The story is straightforward and doesn't have any complexity to it.\n- The main campaign takes about 3-4 hours. It would definitely be longer on the highest difficulty but still nowhere near long enough.\n- While the constant shootouts in this game can be viewed positively, it also becomes so common  that it loses its charm.\n- The new arcade mode is boring and repetitive. If you like to unlock achievements this is a grind. You join a team of AI criminals where you execute a heist to steal cash or other valuables, then shoot your way to the escape vehicle. After you become accustomed to the different maps (which are nicely thought-out I shoud add), you just repeat them over and over to gain ranks and access to different weapons. Not fun.\n\nOverall Score: 5.0/10\n\nKane and Lynch 2: Dog Days is ideal for an afternoon playthrough when you have nothing else to do. A short game filled with action and a story which isn't quite in-depth enough to be captivating. It features some cutscenes which will move you, but in the end falls short in many areas.\n\nOnly grab it very cheap on sale like I did.","February 4, 2014","false","18.0"," 26 of 44 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","26","44","0","0"

Not that it's as good as Gunslinger, no. It's not even close. But it's not that catastrophic.\n\nI think it's worth it to play this once if you like unlikable (uhh, is that possible? you know what I mean) protagonists and want to see them screw up and get themselves into another bad situation.\n\nOne thing I didn't like is the stylistic choice of having headshots 'censored' by the pixel thingie.

Gladly i got this game really cheap on discount. Well so whats to say about this game?\nThe story is boring and just never catches you since the whole gameplay resolves around hiding behind various objects and spraying with your gun and hoping the enemy will die. Seriously, as much guns these guys use its a wonder they have such a horrible aim. But well you will never run out of ammo at least since there are always dozens of weapons laying around.\nIts always the same. You enter a room/hallway/open area and take cover behind some object and a wave of enemies approaches. When uve killed them all, move on to the next location and take cover again. Another wave of enemies and so on. Between those waves u get cutscenes which arent really great since they mostly consist of a shaky camera and somebody getting killed. And between those "real" cutscenes u get some short cutscene showing kane&lynch opening a door or climing a wall to get to the next shooting range area.\nYeah, this game is probably an advanced shooting range simulator. That could sum it up well. Otherwise its quite boring and repeating itself til suddenly the credits roll.\nThis title is really a shame for Square Enix. They can do way better. Still, i bought it cuz i got the First Kane&Lynch but i dont think u need to buy this game because its really much worse than the first one. Storywise u wont miss  anything since the story is probably as entertaining as vacuum cleaning.\nIf u have a "running around naked" fetish (perhaps involving blood too) then this game is definitly for you. Otherwise....well you wont miss anything.","September 11, 2015","false","2.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

Don't get me wrong, I'd love to know what happens next, just a strange cliffhanger. Not sure where they would take it if they made a 3rd game\n* The shaking of the camera when you are sprinting is ridiculous - this is probably the most frustrating thing in the game\n* Not really the games fault, but the multiplayer is pretty much dead.

The game is shot like you are looking through a handheld camera. Although you can turn on steady cam for anyone prone to motion sickness, the rest of the effects cannot be turned off. This is a welcome change. Most games allow you to turn off their effects, I appreciated that Dog Days had a vision and stuck too it with this game.\n\nWhile the visual style is distinct, unfortunately the other parts of the game are not. It's a standard cover based third person shooter, the story did enough to keep me wanting to see how it played out, despite the fair amount of cliches, such as Kane talking about this being his last job, or one the characters literally saying "I'm too old for this".\n\nThe game is also incredibly short, it took me just under 4 hours to finish the single-player campaign on medium. Even though their is multiplayer, I was unable to find any ranked or player matches.\n\nUltimately Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days is a flawed game, the visual style is very unique, but goes to waste in a game that is not that much fun to play.","November 29, 2013","true","4.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It appears the characters have had their personalities "changed" from the first game and there's very little mention of actions from the first game. It's almost like they took the characters and just put them in a whole new game without any care about the first game. The graphics and gameplay this time is much better, however there's simply not enough content in this game to keep people interested. The story is forgettable where you just run around Shanghai killing everyone for no reason and the arcade mode/multi-player is fun the first time around and then you realize it's essentially PayDay.","March 28","false","4.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It has intensity and is pretty atmospheric. You are not playing as some badass heroes fighting for just cause. Kane and Lynch were complete bаstards in the first game, and they remain being themselves in this sequel. And even those attempts of Lynch to save his girlfriend don't change fact: he and Kane lack pretty much every good moral side that any normal person has. This makes you feel the originality of the game, as it clearly doesn't have modern popular action game cliches.\nBut still, I can hardly recommend this game to anyone. I could barely follow the plot of the game, as it is unclear. Most of the time you are simply forced to survive in unending street gang and police gunfire. Graphically the game did not evolve even the slightest bit since "Dead Men", although there are solid 3 years between the releases of "Dead Men" and "Dog Days"; all they did is that swaying and shaking camera, as if an amateur cameraman follows every step of those two, shooting all the action on his mobile phone (it can be disabled in the options at least). Character control is rough, it lacks smoothness; try running around in co-op with your friend and you'll see. Cover system isn't great as well: you may get shot just because you hit "cover" at the wrong side of the cover itself, which leaves you exposed to enemy fire, and it takes some time to jump over to the other side. Leaving cover may not be always convenient, as the "cover" button has multiple functions depending on the nearest environment. AI is not smart at all, especially when in cover; you can simply run to the other side and shoot the crap out of your enemy while he won't be able to do anything about it, although this can be dangerous in the end, because there are usually lots of them; so, quantity over quality.\nAnd yeah, the game is too short. I mean, you are able to complete the singleplayer within, literally, 3 hours. Same is about the co-op.\nThe game had potential, it just needed a lot more polishing. But alas.\nIt may be worth a shot when on a discount, though.","July 24, 2014","false","3.0"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","1"

Well then this might be the game for you.\n\nThis game takes everything the predecessor did and improves upon it immensely. The game play is much more responsive and fluid. The array of weaponry at your disposal really packs a punch adding to the heart pounding action you find from pretty much constant shoot outs.\n\nThe story is winding and epic, with many great set pieces and extended firefights. The environments are more vivid and feel alive. The whole game takes place throughout Shanghai, from slums to sky scrapers each level feels unique and feels totally different. The characters are much more fleshed out and defined, there isn’t a huge cast of secondary characters but this game is focused almost exclusively on the main duo and their exploits in a very short period of time.\n\nI like this game and I had a good time working my way through everything. It is not the best game I have ever played but I did have a better time with it than the original. The one drawback is the sudden ending, but right up to that point everything was pretty solid.\n\nI would recommend this over the original but I still can’t recommend this at full price. Pick this up on sale, play it for a while but don’t bother completing it as you will be left with a bittersweet taste.\n\nHave fun ^_^","May 10, 2014","true","3.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The worst thing about it has to be the use of the awkward Youtube filter, it blurs the visuals and makes what could of been a visually superb game into a grotesque being equivilent of Katie Price. Ultimately this Gears clone lacks any sort of a substance. Kane & Lynch 2 has a weak story, weaker characterisation and is an unrewarding experience all in all. Levels grow repetitive fast, cover doesn't actually work and online co-op is laggy even on a solid connection.\n\nPlease, please, please avoid Kane & Lynch 2. IO Interactive, it's developers, are capable of more - their work on Freedom Fighters and Hitman is evidence of this.

I mean, the shaky cam gave me a headache, and for the first time in my life I got to experience motion sickness. Once I figured out where they hid the option for the shaky cam (hint: it's in the controls section), I finished the main game in only 3 hours... without rushing.\n\nThe main story revolves around Kane and Lynch getting together for one more job. Everything goes to hell, and you shoot your way out. That is pretty much the whole story, right there. I wish I was kidding right now.\n\nThe game was short, repetitive, and for the most part, downright awful. Aiming sucked, the cover-based mechanics were sub-par, and the story was nowhere to be found. The graphics, while alright in some places, were stitched together with overused lighting effects, and what J. J. Abrams would consider to be too many lens flares. This was likely used in an attempt to hide their rushed graphics.\n\nThey also do this weird thing in the game where they censor headshots... you shoot someone in the head, a big blur spot appears and breaks immersion. If you want to kill a game, this is a good place to start. Was it supposed to be artistic, like the shaky cam?\n\nI'm really not sure there is much to recommend with this game, I barely stuck with it long enough to finish it.\n\nGraphics: 6/10 (once you turn off shaky cam)\nStory: 2/10 (Hey, we're shooting people... that's a story, right?)\nGameplay: 5/10 (it was playable, not much else)\nOverall: ... 3/10?

The game takes place from the perspective of Lynch and if you can find someone to play with you can get a very Dead Space 3 type game in which Lynch is having delusions that Kane cannot see.  Dog Days is really interesting because you are throwsn into a gang war right from the start.  The camera is really well done in a modern reality T.V. type perspective as though it is a camera person following you around.  This leads to the action feeling appropriately jarring and disorienting.  I'm really enjoying this so far and find it to be a huge improvement over the forst game.

It usualy does'nt work when a famous director who makes horror films, leaves his major genre to make movies in different genre, for example comedy. It would be interesting to see their effort in different fields but just for a test. It would take so much time and effort if Rockstar want to leave open world games to develop a FPS like COD and I believe it won't be a good game, atleast not like COD.\n\nI wrote all the description above to say it dose'nt work for IO interactive too. When they developed the first Kane and Lynch, I played it and it was obvious that the game is'nt a good Third Person Shooter. I found that IO is not a good shooter developer and they should remain at stealth genre and just rule at Action/Stealth kingdom. I was never thinking that IO is going to develop a sequel for Kane and Lynch.\n\nKayne and Lynch Dog Days is just ordinary and even bad. Like the previous game, here we face repetitive action flow in most of levels. Developers have tried to refresh the game flow by defining some action scenarios like shooting from a flying heli or scorting a car but num. of these scenes are very low and they can't help. Shooting machanic does'nt feel good again just like KL1. Enemy AI is awful and It does'nt try to challange player through the appropriate way like flanking, changing cover to get some better position or trying to get player out of his cover; they just wait for player to peek cover to start shooting him. In some of the levels, there are encounters which player faces so many enemies and because of AI system. it just turns into a frustrating battle. The only innovating element of the game is its camera which would seem very intresting, but after a few minutes, the feel of interest will be replaced with headache because of its shake and noises.\n\nKane and Lynch characters may seem attractive at the first place. I know people who say they like Kane and Lynch serie just because of their characters. But good characters need room in a good story to act and shine. Both Kane and Lynch games have very simple and repetitive story so there's no chance for characteriztion. Honestly, I really don't know why some of gamers like Kane and Lynch characters, because except some cool visual elements, Kane is an ordinary criminal who loves his daughter and Lynch is a crazy idiot partner who always makes trouble.\n\nAfter all things I wrote, you better know that Kane and Lynch 2 has an online mode too with some interesting modes, and you can also play coop throuhg main campaign with another player which sounds great. But unfortunately, there are no online players most of time and unless you have some friends in this game to play with, you won't be able to try the online or coop mode.\n\nFinal word, just try IO's hitmans and enjoy them because there's nothing precious in Kane and Lynch waiting for you.","November 3, 2015","false","3.0"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","1"

No blood - censored faces when headshot. Useless allies. Useless cover. Limited mobility (and therefore view/protection) when in cover. Useless graphics settings. Dead multi-player.\n\nStory is worse than the first one and it takes about as long to beat. Screen shakes enough to give anyone motion sickness whenever you're moving (and sometimes when you're just trying to shoot from cover). There's no blood, just blurred out faces. You can't switch your allies' weapons manually like you could in the first one, so a lot of the time they just have a pistol or SMG when you're fighting guys with rifles. However, they do have ammo (though they don't seem to shoot a lot and, when they do, they miss 95% of the time) and, when they run out, they pick up a weapon. Multi-player is dead, so the DLC is useless, but it sounds like it would be fun for probably longer than the story took to beat if people played it. Aiming is terrible, although you don't shoot the cover you were hiding behind as much as the first one, you do sometimes shoot it. There's a lot of cover that's breakable and after breaking, the AI will move to a different cover, giving you some time to shoot them. Although it seems like the AI could shoot you through most, even unbreakable, cover, so the cover is mostly useless. Moving along cover just didn't happen - most of places you could use cover was right at the end of an object, which isn't the best if you can't see the enemy from that spot. If you wanted to move along the object, you had to get out of cover and run to the other end of the object where you could use cover again. There are some graphics settings that are supposed to make the game better to look at, but nothing seems to make it look better. Pretty much just like any other third-person shooter with a short, poorly-written story.","May 13, 2015","false","4.8"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","12","22","3","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/28000/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","972 products in account","Quick Summary: Kane & Lynch 2 is a superior product to the first game, not just with the improved graphics and arcade mode, but also with Steam achievements and co-op campaign play. It’s still inferior to Max Payne 3, but you should enjoy the experience. Note that the game is extremely short, and multiplayer is dead.\n\nOnce again, you play one of the dysfunctional anti-heroes Kane or Lynch (which character you play switches during the campaign) and this time around you’re dealing with crime lords and corrupt officials in Shanghai. Both Kane and Lynch are bad dudes, so you’re not trying to clean up the streets, you just want to do your dirty work without being crushed by your powerful enemies. Despite the grittiness and ultra-violence in the story, the game is still censored for some reason. When you perform a headshot, the dead guy has his head pixelated. This appears to be a stylistic choice because there’s blood and gore everywhere, not to mention non-stop cursing.\n\nJust like Kane & Lynch 1, the game is played in third person and you run around blasting rival gangsters and taking cover to regenerate your health as needed. The bullets are flying everywhere, so you take cover or you’ll die. By the way, even on easy mode you die pretty fast in this game if you’re up close to the enemy. Don’t think you can just run up to everyone just because you have the difficulty set low. Just like in the first game, you can find all sorts of weapons dropped by your enemies, some good and some bad. In the multiplayer, guns you pick up have like half a clip of ammo, but in the campaign you can go through the levels picking and choosing what you want to use. Unlike the first game, you cannot request more ammo from your team mates.\n\nPros:\n+Decent graphics and storyline.\n+The Fragile Alliance multiplayer mode is kind of fun, too bad nobody is playing online anymore. At least you can play it in Arcade mode with bots as team mates. Work together to grab cash, then turn on them so you can get it all!\n\nCons:\n-Very short game. Maybe less than 5 hours for the campaign.\n-Nobody online to co-op with or play heists with.\n\nOverall if you got this game in the bundle with Kane & Lynch 1, give it a try because it’s better than the first game. It won’t blow you away though.\n","February 22","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamjojje/recommended/28000/","iamjojje","Jojje","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamjojje/","392 products in account","Despite quite a short campaign with a fairly abrupt ending, this game is still worth playing because of its co-operative mode.\nThe visual style is very dark and dreary, as if filmed from a low-end camcorder in the hands of a novice journalist documenting the exploits of an ex-mercenary and his unmedicated psychotic best friend, complete with light flaring, grainy image and mosaic censoring out headshots and nudity.\n\nThe co-op campaign is interesting enough as-is, but the game also comes in a co-operative/backstabbery multiplayer flavor called 'Fragile Alliance' where teammates rob a cache of money and compete to try to make it out with the most cash. Everyone starts out as friends and teammates, but at any moment any player could decide to betray the alliance, to try to keep his share for himself and not split it. This fact keeps the multiplayer very dynamic and tense, and you have to keep an eye over your shoulder constantly, as any of your teammates could decide to shoot you in the back, given the opportunity. The multiplayer is, in that way, just as vicious as the campaign.\n\nThe game isn't without flaws, the campaign is fairly short and ends pretty suddenly, and the story may be lacking in some departments. But it's still a solid title for people itching to play something with a friend. As opposed to the first game, this title can be played in co-op online.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly standard third person cover shooter with pretty entertaining gunplay and cool effects.\n\nAll in all I recommend a buy. It's 9,99€ so if you want a good co-op experience, do pick it up.","March 1, 2014","true","5.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The "YouTube/documentary" filters(and don't complain about the "hand-held" camera style - go to Options, turn Steadicam on. You're welcome) are well-done and a memorable approach to the gritty, realistic TPS. Both new multiplayer modes are great(Undercover Cop joins Fragile Alliance in providing a unique approach to multiplayer shooter game-play). The setting of the crime-ridden, corrupt-laden Shanghai manages to be bleak without getting boring, repetitive or off-putting. Controls, shooting and cover mechanics are responsive, open enough to not feel linear yet tight enough that it always does what you want it to. This never, ever lets up, telling the story, establishing characters and keeping it all moving with twists along the way without ever, for a single second, pausing... and yet it doesn't overpower the player; it's like The Terminator in video-game form. Challenging. Online co-op. Great graphics and atmosphere.\n\nCons: Not only should the first one never have a sequel, but plot-wise, this does not need to exist, and completely undersells both leads; why is Kane doing another job(and don't say "money for you-know-who" - that's an excuse, and not even a good one), and in what *universe* could Lynch "settle down" like this? This is one of the shortest SP campaigns you'll ever find, and the ending is unsatisfying. Multiplayer is all but dead, the only way you'll get a match going is to find people who also want it.\n\nMy recommendation: Only the biggest fans of the TPS gritty crime story will like this, and most people will never need to give this even a first look.","January 1, 2014","true","130.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It has a great story to it.

The game has an actual story and meaning when you play it through till the end. If you play Kane & Lynch: Dead Men You will see how Kane and Lynch were and how they became like this in 2.

Some notable elements people do not like about the game: shaky cam when running (you can actually turn this off), pixelation and "elongated" lighting effects. The last two are in line with the documentary style concept the developers had - all these serve to tell you a story in a more realistic way. To a certain degree you feel like watching a sequel to Heat. Now, how cool is that, right?\n\nThe problem with Kane and Lynch is how IO Interactive could not put these pieces together very well. Instead, the game is marred by several other issues that do not let you understand what the creators tried to achieve here. Notable examples: the game is extremely short. Can be completed in a couple of hours and then you are off to coop should you be able to find anyone out there waiting for you for the same reason (it is unlikely, though). The game utilises a cover-based system in a horrible way: enemies can easily hit you once behind cover for no apparent reason. This is challenging, yes, but not in a positive way. Furthermore, each and every foe is a sharp-shooter while you can barely hit anyone with precision aiming as the controls are so bad. Even headshots do not count occasionally. And as throughout a level you are apt to eliminate dozens of criminals, cops and members of the special forces the aiming issue is an unforgivable one.\n\nIt is already difficult to accept a game that follows a very violent, dark and gritty theme. IO Interactive made it even more difficult by not paying enough attention to the gameplay itself - it is simply not fun to play this game. Its predecessor was already a passable product but this is quite horrible, actually.

I'd heard bad things about it, but wanted to play it for myself and give it a chance to stand on its own.\n\nIMHO, this game is terrible. The story is nonsensical. It seems to try and be gritty for the sake of it. Its extremely clunky! It seems to play far worse than the first game, which to be honest also had some flaws in regards to smooth gameplay. It all feels slapped together hastily and in the most wonky way possible. I was shocked that it was made by the same team from the first game.\n\nI got it on sale a while back for around $3 I think. I beat it in one sitting, and I unlocked a slew of achievements that were just handed to the player, well because. I didn't do anything special, just obtained achievements for playing the game. I don't feel that a game should be measured based on how long it is, but I really can't honestly say my 3.7 hours was 'fun'. I finished it just for the sake of doing so, and because of how much I loved the first game.\n\nIf you are curious about Kane & Lynch, play the first game. If you are interested in playing multiplayer, then 'maybe' play this one? I didn't play the multiplayer, but it does look like it offers some decent fun with interesting modes. You may also like this game if you love shakey-cam...seriously, this game is Shakey-cam and Camera Filters 2: Dog Days -_-\n\nWhat happened IO Interactive?

While the story still doesn't deliver, the game is a big improvment from its previous version. This tyme around we play as both main characters from the games.\nEverything was repolished and improved in this sequel. The enemy AI is not good here, however the damage you take from getting hit have increased and the game will throw tons of enemies at you all the time. Now you need to be careful not to get hit, because 4 to 5 shots from an automatic gun will take you down on normal difficulty. The graphics have increased drasticaly and the good cover system is back with even more destruction.\nIt is obvious that the sequel has the same concept as the previous game, but this time around the overall story and feeling of the game is much darker. You will find really disturbing scenes and crazy new ideas the developers used to make a great experience.\nDon't worry about multiplayer, because this time around it works. However you won't find many people playing this game. But once you gather a group the multiplayer mods are really enjoyable. Such as cops and crooks.\nThe different levels of difficulty and new achivments will make you want to come back to replay some levels you unlock. However, one of the annoying aspects of the game is the camera system. The default camera system is aweful. It will shake a lot when you run or fire the weapons, they try to make the game more realistic but it just gets extreamlly annoying not to be able to shoot your enemies because of it. Thankfully there is an option to tun off this shakey camera system, which improves the gameplay a lot. This time around the weapons have some good weight and feel good to fire. Alhtough they are not very accurate and one can't simply click the mouse button like crazy, they still feel good to use.\nOverall this sequel is an improvment over the first game with an even darker feel and good combat. The game is still short but fun.\n\nGood:\n\n- The mood of the game and overall feel\n- Improved difficulty\n- Voice acting and characters\n- Great Multiplayer (if you can find a match)\n\nBad:\n\n- Shakey camera system, even in cutscenes\n- Censored head shots and nudity (with pixels)\n- Again the game is too short (4-5 hrs. to finish on normal in Single Player mode :/)\n\n76/100","January 18, 2015","true","4.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I didn't want to buy this title at full price due to the mixed review but years after i picked up Dog Days on a discount from Steam.\n\nIn my view there are two original aspects in the game - the shaky cam and the brutal nude-level. You can either love or hate it but at least it's not medicore or generic like the rest of the game. There is so much wasted potential in this unsatisfying game.\n\nYou will hate the generic enemies coming at you in endless waves and if you have played the original the missed oppotunity in regards to the story will be down right insulting. Actually the story is insulting even compared to a generic shooter as the ending sets a new standard for 'worst ever'.\n\nWhile the original also had broken game mechanics you came to accept this as a 'factor' in the fights. In Dog Days it's even worse. At the end of the day I'm sad to say the game is not worth your time.","October 18, 2014","false","22.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Well, it's mildly entertaining and does have some nice set pieces, moments, etc. But, after the 4 hours (3.8 to be exact) it took to beat the game, I'm left saying, "meh" to it all.\n\nThe story is pretty hum-drum, i.e. The big crime boss' daughter gets killed and suddenly, *SPOILER* you're in the line of fire for being the ones that got her killed. And if you think it gets any further than that, story-wise, you'd be wrong. It just felt like a generic 80's film where some americans shoot some guns at the "bad guys" with the loosest possible plot being attached. Oh, and Kane & Lynch are not exactly likeable, so...yeah, there's that.\n\nThe gameplay itself is enjoyable to a point, but it does get pretty repetitive. Take cover, shoot at some menz. Run up to the next area, but, oh no, more menz! Best take cover and shoot them when possible! Rinse and repeat. There's nothing else in this game! No variation. Well, except for a brief helicoptor ride, but that's all I can remember.\n\nAnd the last thing I want to touch on are the graphics. They're ok, but, the FOV is HORRIBLE! For the first time ever, a small FOV actually did make me slightly nauseous. Well done K&L2, no other game has ever done that to me! Also, some of the art style choices were a little odd. E.g. the game censors people who you shoot in the face. Legitimately, it puts that mosquito looking haze over someone's face! But it never explains why it does this. If it's a style choice, it's a strange one for a game. And there are parts of the game where dead characters are similarly covered in this hazy effect to hide their nudity or injuries. Lighting could also have weird (not even as good as) J.J. Abrams lens flare effects!\n\nOverall, I have to say, it's not worth recommending. I mean, true, taking down the gangster's henchmen while juggling which guns to pick up from the bodies that littered the streets, was mildly entertaining as a game. If it's a couple of quid and you just want some mindless shooting with a minimal plot, go for it. Anything more and you're in a HUGE disappointment. But yeah, it's not really a recommendation! Saying that, try it, don't try it. But don't say I didn't warn you :)","September 18, 2015","false","4.1"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

A mode in which you and 7 npc's rob a location and then proceed to the extraction point fighting off police. The cool thing is you can kill your own partners and collect their money at the expense of everybody turning on you. The mode features different maps to play on, some easier than others.\n\n\nThe Average\n\nThe single player campaign is woefully average, from the graphics to the gameplay to the design, nothing about it stands out. The game has a filter to give the appearance that its being filmed by a cheap video camera, apparently this is suppose to make the game 'edgy' but in reality its incredibly annoying. The good news however is that you can turn this filter off. Technically the graphics are good giving you plenty of graphical options to play with yet artistically the game is boring, every level looks and feels the same and no risk or creativity was taken with the level design. In a third person shooter you need interesting set pieces to keep things fresh and engaging and this game has none of that. Every level plays out exactly the same way, enter a room, kill wave of enemies and proceed to the next area...rinse and repeat until the game is over. One aspect the campaign got right was your AI companion is actually useful and is pretty effective in combat, something that I rarely see in games these days, most AI companions are either incompetent, bullet sponges or distractions. The other positive thing I can say is that the campaign is short so you don't have to suffer through mediocrity for too long.\n\nThe character Kane and Lynch are decently written but nothing really makes them stand out among the other generic videogame characters in the same genre.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nMultiplayer is dead as usual, shame, because if arcade mode is anything to go by, multiplayer looks like fun.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nI never played Kane and Lynch before, the first one requires GFWL...so yeah... and this game did little to impress me. There are plenty of other great third person shooters on Steam worth your attention and money. This is a game you play when you have no other games to play. Worth purchasing at a steep discount.\n","October 30, 2015","true","8.6"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Aside from the fact it was extremely short (3.5-4 hours) there were no real quality elements to draw you in. It was more like an arcade mode with some attempt at a story. None of the story brought you in or got you engrossed in the characters or what was happening. Mostly, it was just a run-and-gun game.\n\nI was honestly surprised when after just four hours into the game the credit were rolling.\n\nOverall, this game is disappointing and not worth it at all. If you want to play a game like this, but better and with a good story I'd recommend getting Sleeping Dogs.","August 1, 2014","false","4.4"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

The excitment was because the prequel was promising, and had potential back did not deliver thus I was excited to play this sequel hoping to see improvement. Man was i disappointed.\n\nYes its true that there are improvements on the gameplay etc, but the major turn off about this sequel is the camera. From what i read about censorship, it seems that the developer chose for a "handheld", "youtube", "homemade" camera art direction style. Oh my, its the first time i ever get giddy from playing a FPS.\n\nImprovements such as better aiming and hit recognition (still bad) can be seen in this sequel. The AI partner also has been improved greatly. They actually do kill the enemies unlike the previous game.\n\nStoryline is very shallow, worst still than the first. I personaly preferred the plot of the first story. Not to worry, you won't miss out much in terms of story if you decide to hope into this.\n\nI would say i'm greatly disappointed about this game.

I felt the little touches like loading screens reading as "buffering" was neat, Then we enter the first cutscene. The graphics seemed fine, and the story started off simple enough: Kane's in China and helping out Lynch with an easy job. Suddenly, the bullets start flying as we opened the door to the apartment to see a chinese man in his underwear wielding a gun, beside him a young woman whose naughty bits were tastefully censored through large pixelated mosaics.\n\nIt wasn't until gameplay started, where the man shrugged off a dozen gunshots and promptly teleported away that I realized what I was in for.\n\nKane & Lynch 2 does something you don't see very many modern shooters incorporate, and that's fantasy and magical elements. You don't just fight gangsters, crooked cops, and the chinese military, you also fight against an assortment of wizards, chronomancers, and straight-up terminators. Alongside your standard enemies, you'll run into opponents who seem impervious to bullet fire, or having the capability to blink between reality as they teleport from one point to the next (some even phase through walls or cover!). Their ability to deny the laws of physics adds a new element to the gameplay, along with bringing another level of difficulty that I find refreshing in this genre.\n\nOn top of that, Kane and Lynch also gain the ability to weave spells, however to a much more limited degree (for example, you can only teleport very short distances and in order to trigger the two of you need to hit the button prompt beside a large enough door).\n\nIf delving into the mean streets of China and getting involved with the occult is your sort of thing, then I'd wholeheartedly recommend Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days!","December 6, 2014","true","2.1"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","12","23","2","1"

Kinda of a dichotomy to the overall nature of the game.\n\nThe only few possitive things, one being the lead voice talent for Kane (Brian Bloom) and Lynch (Jarion Monroe ). The other being its unique approach to its visual asthetics, simulating digital video noise and video grime, bringing with it a documentarian style cinematography during its cut scenes which may be nauseating at times. But the immersive effect is often broken by the overall graphics looking poor and AI enemies missing key frames of animation when they move.\n\nAs a cultural artifact Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days is not something to be held with high regard.","July 25, 2014","false","3.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is racist, in the way that you and your best buddy are 2 white dudes taking on and killing battalions after battalions of Chinese gangsters, soldiers, special forces, apaches, and any chinese being which you care to put a bullet throguh. All the female characters in this game are ♥♥♥♥♥/killed/kill-♥♥♥♥♥, except for the air-stewardess at the end, which maybe the main characters will ♥♥♥♥ as well. Shanghai is your playground, where the dammages you will cause are in the billions. This game is also highly queer as you and your best buddy are two middle aged white men, of which they have shown affection towards each other, and this affection grows strong as one of the men, Lynch, screws up over and over again while the other, Kane, sticks with him throughout the series. These two men are bonded by sweat, blood, tears and expletives. A fine piece of affection is displayed between these two men throughout the game. This game has gore as well, though which game doesn't?\n\nBut the thing is, why does this game have to censord anything that they feel "gruesome" or "obscene"?! I don't really care if a naked girl is ♥♥♥♥♥ and gutted and killed with blood and sperm all over the place, or that a girl is stripped off her underwear, showing her pubes (or that she doesn't have pubes), or even if the two protagonists have their 7-inch ding-dongs (not measured) dangling out and swaying around in a pendulum motion, but why the hell do you have to put mosaique on almost everything?! That girl without her underwear looks like some actress from Japanese pornography, and so do the two main characters and their hanging ding-dongs! Worse still, any gore are censorded with squarish mosaique boxes. Meaning: headshot - censorded. Blood, censorded. Naked chicks, censorded. You got shot, censorded... Not that I care about a few extra boxes (well, I actually do when you are censording cute naked girls, just saying), but do you have any idea how laggy those mosaique boxes are? My computer has no problem running Dark Souls 2 at max setting, but my system hanged while the mosaique strikes - the only time my computer crashed when I run any games! Heck.\n\nTalking about bugs, please do expect some unforeseen circumstances, such as the loss of voice, sudden lags, teleporting enemies, and, for my pal, the inability to deal any dammage. Yes, this game is quite buggy at times, especially when you are in a co-op game with your pal, so do expect some turbulence at times.\n\nI am not saying that this game isn't good. The story-line is worth exploring with your pal, but please bear in mind that this game does NOT contain a free-world, meaning both the story and the maps are extremely linear. You walk from point A to point B, cutscenes, repeat. Some of you might like this bold story, and others might not. Whatever the case it is, try it, but only at an extremely discounted price.","June 23, 2014","true","3.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The shooting feels so bad, I can't describe it. After that first person I tried to give it 2 more chances. Same thing happened.\nSo then I avoided it, until recently. I don't know why, but I started to give it another try.\nThe story is pretty cool and the voice acting is simply brilliant, like the first game. The game is detailed, but not in a high def sort of way. That's because the camera is being used as a playable YouTube video. Messy headshots will get blurred, as well as naked bodies, and the camera will move like someone is directly following you around with one.\nIt's a really cool idea, but there are a lot of shakycam shots.\nThe shooting still feels terrible. They might've done that to artificially lengthen the game, I don't know (it's about 3,5 hours long), but it sometimes takes minutes to take down a couple of guys that would normally take you mere seconds.

It is violent, but I can't get a hold of the story. I'm a believer that you should be able to glean even a bit of story if you jump into a sequel, but there is none of that here. It almost seems as if you're just re-enacting a bunch of gunfight scenes from a bunch of different movies.\n\nOne thing I noticed is that a lot of the game seems similar to those 'carnival-style' games where you have to shoot the ducks as they pop up behind obstacles.\n\nAnother criticism I have is the lack of jumping. You have to crouch, then press a combination of forward and uncrouch. It's a 21st century 3D game, how hard is it to add jumping over obstacles?\n\nThe graphics are fairly good, but I hate the way the camera moves. I get that its supposed to be mimicking a handheld camera, but it really goes over the top, and it makes it very hard to play the game.\nAlso, the very-close over the shoulder angle is very difficult to play by.\n\nAs for sound design, I found that in some of the cutscenes the background sounds were loud enough to encroach on the spoken words, and I had to rely on subtitles.\n\nI just don't think this is very much of a game. I guess if you're a fan of the series you might be able to make more out of it, but to me it just seems awful.\n","May 16, 2015","false","1.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sure, if I had paid a lot for it, 3.5 hours of single player content is simply not enough. Pick this up in the bargain basement however, and that's 3.5 hours of highly stylised adult entertainment, that feels like playing a movie.\n\nGraphics look highly original and stylised (but only with full screen effects left on) and the gun play does feel good, once you realise that SMG and Shotguns are next to worthless and that headshots are king.\n\nThe compression artefacts are overdone, as well as the shaky cam when running. In the last level this actually made me feel a little ill. However I found the cam when walking etc to be great, and it felt like a movie.\n\nIf you are looking for a quick, violent adult experience that plays a little like the child of Gears of War and a Quentin Tarantino movie, this is for you.

Unlike the first game, this time you play through as the more interesting of the two, Lynch (until the final level, for no clear reason), and it's more of a typical AAA third-person cover-shooter. The constant shaky-cam will likely make you feel ill after a while (imagine your average 'running' shaky-cam when you walk, and multiply that by 4 when you run in this game), but it's not too bad as to be unplayable. There's no team management like the first, but Dog Days give you far more interesting visuals, locations (if you like a Chinese aesthetic) and set-pieces (the standout moment of playing a full level compltely naked after being tortured). This game is by no means ground-breaking, but if you like the genre you won't find anything too offensive here.","February 16","true","5.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But will you want to play the sequel ? in Kane and Lynch 2 we don't play as Kane but we play as Lynch. After the events in the first game Lynch moves to Shanghai where he settles down with a woman and does minor jobs to get money. But then he needs one man to do a Arms Deal with a local crime boss. So he calls on Kane. Kane is desperete for money so he accepts. After the visit they do one minor job which ends with the crime bosses daughter dying and the entire criminal underground trying to kill them both. So how is Kane and Lynch 2 ? This game gives me mixed feelings. Where i feel steam should give me an option to give it a middle score. I dont feel the game is bad but its not good either. The gameplay is standart third person stuff. Run take cover and kill anyone in sight but it gives it own twist on the genre. The game is shown through a found footage style deal. Where you feel you are being followed by a camera man and i really like this unique approach. But for people with motion sickness dont worry cause the game lets you to disable the shaky cam.\nGraphiclly the game is bleak in color. The only color you see is from street signs which are all neon pink and purple. The game also is incredibly short. I finished the game in 2 hours and ending is one of the worst endings i have ever seen in my entire life. But theres also a multiplayer aspect to the game and that is really fun. I played in on consoles but the sad thing is you need friends to play MP on pc cause i couldnt find any games. Overall Kane And Lynch 2 Dog Days isnt a bad game but its not good either. I would reccomend getting it at a discount and not full price. I give Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days a 6.5/10","February 28, 2015","true","2.6"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

It has good cinematic experience, really intense action/adventure like Die Hard movie. The problem is all your weapons have terrible accuracy except the handgun! This make the Extreme Difficulty really really hard to beat because you have to get headshot for quick 1 shot kill. The enemy on the other hand have really good accuracy and health too. So imagine how frustrating it is to beat the game on Extreme.\n\nStory is short, i think it's shorter than the 1st one. The first half of the game is great, but the 2nd half kind of boring. You basically just have to beat waves after waves of enemies. It's like the developers ran out of story and just want the gameplay to be longer than the story itself. As for technical problems, none that I encountered.\n\nCONCLUSION :\nRecommended on sale price.","March 7","true","22.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/breakfastcompanion/recommended/28000/","breakfastcompanion","Deluxe Breakfast Companion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/breakfastcompanion/","1043 products in account","Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days is the worst video game I have ever played.\n\nThe story begins with Kane and Lynch in Shanghai trying to scrape together a gun running deal.  Before the deal goes down, Lynch drags Kane to go settle a grudge match with some guy for some reason.  The duo accidentally kill a girl who happens to be the daughter of some government bureaucrat with enough money, power, and influence to not only control his own gang, but the police and even the Chinese military.  His goons pursue Kane and Lynch.  Kane and Lynch get caught and tortured.  What follows is the most gruesome, unncessary, and tasteless sequence in an already awful game, in which we see our lovely protagonists running around naked and covered and blood.  Then they get captured again, get taken to the villain's building, and decide to kill him while they're there, because why not?  After killing him, they escape, and the player is left wondering what the point was.\n\nBecause having a shallow, pointless, and disgusting plot wasn't enough, the game also features a shallow, pointless, and disgusting graphical gimmick.  The entire game is designed to look like it's being filmed on a handheld camera.  This makes no sense in-universe since nobody with a camera is actually following the duo around.  The result is shaky cam that would disgust Paul Greengrass, horrible looking lens flares, and a generally disgusting visual aesthetic.  The effect is amplified when running, and will make you want to puke as the visuals go out of focus and shake wildly.  Just charming!\n\nThe gameplay is built around simple, co-operative third person shooting.  It's about as standard and bland as it can get.  Headshots instant-kill enemies that would otherwise be massive bullet sponges.  You hide behind cover (which feels miserable).  There are the mandatory "stealth" sequences that don't actually work.  A turret level.  Shooting down helicopters.  Pretty much all of it is standard to the point of being boring, or it would be if not for the horrific AI.  The enemies are both dumb and dangerous, featuring absurdly good aim (despite the guns being horribly inaccurate when you wield them) and bricks for brains.  They also have a tendency to only peek out of cover for a fraction of a second at a time, turning the game into an obnoxious whack-a-mole clone.  The terrible AI is made even more obvious in coop, since the AI will only ever target one player at a time, and will instantaneously snap between the two.  Because of this, it's not uncommon to sneak up on an enemy only to have them abruptly spin 180 and kill you.  Getting killed is also very frustrating in coop.  You can mash E to stay alive longer so they can come help you up, but the timer is really short and mashing E appears to make absolutely no difference in the amount of time you can survive.  In addition, the E key is used for pretty much everything, so it's not terribly uncommon to try to pick up a friend and find your character instead picking up a fire extinguisher.  While mentioning multiplayer, I should also mention that my experience was extremely laggy.  This could have been my connection, but I think the game just has bad netcode.\n\nA terrible story, hideous visuals, and awful gameplay are capped off with glitchy animation and showstopping bugs.  Numerous animations look quick and jerky.  When you open doors to proceed to the next room, the animation just cuts midway through.  Later in the game my friend and I began to experience characters getting stuck on geometry, massive frame-drops, garbled video, and outright crashes.  The game barely feels functional at all.\n\nKane and Lynch 2: Dog Days is the worst.  When the game isn't glitching itself into unplayability, it's merely disgusting and unpleasant to experience.  9/10 pretty ok.","February 20, 2015","false","4.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","5"

The first one never drew in my attention because of certain mechanics it used, but this one did.\n\nKane & Lynch 2: Dog Days is the second instalment in a third person cover based action shooter game series focused around the stories of two guys. Kane, and Lynch. Kane, a man with a questionable past and morals (who was the main playable character in the first game) has come to Shanghai to visit his... partner, Lynch, a literal psychotic with who he has worked with before, in order to do some business with him. I won't help into too many details, but as expected, things go bad really quickly, and you're thrust into a non stop action thrill ride that will either make you violently ill, or wanting more.\n\nWhat do I mean by this? Well, if you've played the first game, you'll know that it was a fairly normal feeling third person shooter, in which you played as Kane and focused on his story. Now, the focus is put on Lynch, the psychotic. And boy, the game sure does feel like it was made with you actually controlling a psychotic. If Dead Men was a Kane focused normal third person shooter, Dog Days is a Lynch focused psychotic trip.\n\nThe way this is accomplished is mainly by the visuals and camera, which I feel is one of the biggest draws in the game. The visuals in Dog Days behave as though the entire game was being filmed by someone with a camera. There are visual artefacts, intense glare, and blur/pixelation effects used throughout the game. When you get shot, you might see your screen go fuzzy in some areas. If you see a bright light, you might get intense glare. If you shoot a civilian in the face, you might get a pixelated area where their face should be. These are all really neat features and really help to make the game feel like a video. While these have a relatively minor impact on gameplay, there is one more effect that is always in use that may make or break the game for you. The screen shake.\n\nThe screen in this game is ALWAYS shaking. And I do mean ALWAYS. Even when you're crounching behind an obstacle, the screen is still shaking slightly. Sprinting make the camera shake like you'd expect someone sprinting with a video camera would. You get shot? Shaking. You need to run? Shaking. Getting into cover? Do you even need an answer? And considering this game really is non stop action with hardly even a minute of relaxation every now and then, the screen is going to be shaking more than wet dog that's had 50 cups of cold coffee in the snow. This shaking, along with the other effects, can make the game more difficult to play, and can make it difficult to see enemies sometimes, it is also the cause of many headaches from many people, and it's clear to see why. And yet, I absolutely adore this feature. Once again, it really helps with giving the game a gritty feel, and a sense of speed and urgency. Everything is always moving so fast, and Lynch, being a psychotic, obviously has a harder time dealing with it than most people. He's in constant pain, and to a degree, you feel this as well.\n\nSpeaking of fast, by god is this game fast paced There's no collectables or anything to slow you down, and the game in constantly RUN AND SHOOT COVER AND SHOOT RUN AND SHOOT COVER AND SHOOT REPEAT FORVER! The game can be pretty difficult as it doesn't take much for you to get killed, but you also regenerate life fairly quickly and this works really well. Since you play as Lynch for the majority of the game, you always have the computer (or other player) controlling Kane, who is with you for almost the entire game. You can't give him any commands or whatever and he just deals with things himself, and he can't die, so there's no reason to pay mind to him. But the banter between the characters in game is really enjoyable and he doesn't have any negative effect on the game at all. The game is build around having these 2 together and it does so well. If you hate having an extra character constantly tag alone, like Ashley is RE4, Shiva in RE5, or Alyx in HL2, I assure you, the game works really with both of these characters and you are still in complete control the entire time. No waiting for the other character, no inventory management, no revival, or anything like that exists. At least not in single player. In multiplayer, a revival mechanic does exist, but not the other stuff.\n\nHowever while the game is really fast paced, naturally, the game is also over really fast. It takes only 4 hours to beat the main campaign, and I'm counting deaths. If you managed to beat this game without dying (extremely difficult even on normal difficulty and probably on easy, I'd say I died about 100 times on my first playthrough, and don't worry, there's VERY frequent checkpoints) then you're looking at maybe 3  or 2 and a half hours of straight gameplay. While this is a con, the game is VERY jam packed and never has a dull moment to lengthen it out. It also have several extra missions that you can play alone or in multiplayer which add a few hours. I also feel the game is very replayable, as there are no skills trees or anything to worry about. This is a game that starts fast and keep going.\n\nThe story, while nothing particularly noteworthy, does at least draw you into the feelings and thought of the 2 main characters, who are still totally jerks, but ones that you can't help but feel sorry for.\n\nMusic that shows up now and then isn't very noticeable and very forgettable, but isn't bad, and sound effects are fine for the most part. There are some glitches in the game, like the screen going grey and not showing the game, but these are rare and usually fixed just by restarting the game. The weapons feel pretty good to me to be honest, but some seem to not like the sound of them. True, they don't feel overly strong, but since you're shooting 90% of the time anyway, I feel that they feel strong enough. Some of the guns also feel as though they have little to no accuracy to them (except the shotguns, which have a pretty good range for most videogame shotguns) but these weapons are quickly replaced by much better guns with better accuracy. In general, the gunplay feels quite good, covering works fine (most of the time), and it's a joy to play.\n\nSometimes, it also feels like the game hates you, as some parts are incredibly difficult, even at the start, and the ending really seems to come out of nowhere and leaves you asking "was that it... seriously?", but to be honest, I feel this is very refreshing, and sort of goes along with the struggle of Lynch through the game and his deranged mind.\n\nAll in all, Dog Days is a fantastic game, but one that most people will not enjoy. I feel as though a game like this will never be made again considering the reception it got, so this is one of a kind. It's sick, twisted, sad, and psychotic, just like Lynch. And I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nWant to keep updated on games I recommend? I'm a curator!

Kane and Lynch: Dead Men had main characters that were difficult to like, but by the end of the dark and compelling story to save Kane’s family, players felt a bit of Stockholm Syndrome for the duo. The co-op, while offline only, offered a unique perspective for both players, something we rarely see in the age of co-op clone characters. The sequel has arrived and our anti-heroes are back again, this time across the world in Shanghai with Lynch’s story as the focus. But can Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days recapture the same fresh feeling of the first game?\n\nThe story of Dog Days has Kane meeting up with his old pal Lynch who promises a job with plenty of riches. Upon Kane’s arrival a simple task for the two turns sour and inadvertently starts a gang war. Soon you realize that your deal is going south as your contact is attacked in an intense highway assault and you make a desperate attempt to escape with all your lives. It wasn’t long after this I lost what was going on, the overall purpose of what the duo was doing.\n\nDespite some great voice acting and plenty of memorable lines - I had completely forgot the purpose of what I was doing midway through the title. “Why am I shooting these army guys again?” I asked my co-op partner. It had something to do with a big Chinese mob boss and not dieing, but beyond that everything is a bit of chaos. Perhaps this is what IO Interactive was going for, as the main character this time is Lynch, who’s not exactly mentally stable. There’s plenty of times Lynch voices over to himself, trying to use psychological tricks to calm his nerves - no doubt from some sort of therapy sessions.\n\nThe graphical style and display are going to be the most memorable and controversial piece to this game, the shaky YouTube style camera is either going to be a complete turn off or something people really like. At moments the grainy and over saturated look of the game world makes it look eerily realistic. The neon glow of lights bouncing off reflective surfaces, the distant city line of Shanghai, and the dark alleys all can trick your eye in an almost photo realistic moment. Other times poor textures in certain areas, stiff character animation and improper lip syncing totally break the immersion.\n\nShortly into my first mission I almost felt nauseous from the camera movement - but it passed. The shaky camera is only really bad while running and once you get used to it, it provides some useful info on enemy position and adds to the immersive effect. Thankfully if you can’t get over it you can disable it, though it’s still there to some degree.\n\nIO Interactive really wanted to have the feeling of intense and gritty shoot outs. They wanted your palms sweaty and your grip tightening on your controller through every twist and turn. To some degree, this holds true. There were times the firefights were memorable, with exploding objects and cover flying everywhere as bullets rained down on Kane and Lynch. The atmosphere is further enhanced by Asian inspired pop music blasting from in game radios and intercoms, giving it an almost John Woo movie feel in certain situations.\n\nSadly the intensity is broken once you realize the firefights break down into duck, pop up wait for guy to peak his head out of cover, and shoot mechanic. This style of combat is rinse and repeat for most of the game with save for a few battles. Which is sad, because some of the key moments like a helicopter attack on and in an office building and a mission where you need to cover Lynch’s girlfriend in an apartment building across the street are really fun. The level after Kane and Lynch are tortured is one that will be forever burned into my retinas. I just wish there was more of these moments.\n\nKane and Lynch 2 does make a huge improvement in terms of co-op options over it’s predecessor. Full online play and local play is supported and there’s options for matchmaking too. And while the single player is fun, like all good co-op games, playing this with a friend is much more satisfying. You can really tell that K&L 2 was designed from the ground up for co-op play; level layouts are well crafted into separate paths for cover and flanking maneuvers and there’s a nice balance of weapons to choose from for both close and long range giving players defined roles. One thing that sadly appears to be missing is some of the crazier elements of Lynch from the first game - instance where the players actually see different things. As far as we could tell they weren’t as prominent as the cops/civilians bank scene from the first game.\n\nCo-Op makes the game a bit easier as well. While in the single player game if you get shot you’ll get knocked down and have a chance to get up, a second subsequent knock down will kill you. In co-op this second knockdown is actually revivable by your co-op partner. This can help in some of the trickier situations when the game is throwing what seems like hundreds of guys your way only to be killed by the last group and having to do it all over again. While the checkpoint system seems ok, it never seems to be quite enough, and starting a co-op game will lose any single player checkpoint progress - so you’ll need to restart back at a chapter beginning.\n\nIt’s these little nagging issues that constantly remind you that perhaps Kane and Lynch 2 wasn’t quite ready. I hit numerous technical bugs as well - mostly while playing as a guest co-op player over Xbox Live. Cut scenes were missing characters, character animations got stuck, audio cut out on me completely, and the game even crashed at one point. Strangely while playing solo or as the host these seemed almost non existent.\n\nIf you don’t want to play Fragile Alliance online there’s a new Arcade mode where you can use all AI guys and try to get the highest score possible. This mode is surprisingly addictive, though, it does get a bit long in the tooth by the 9th or 10th round. The game will up the difficulty with every round and you can keep going until you run out of your 3 lives.\n\nSo does Kane and Lynch 2 deliver that fresh feeling of the first game? Sadly I don’t think it does. While IO did a great job of fixing the cover and shooting mechanic, adding online co-op, and deepening the addictive multiplayer modes - it seems the rest of the game suffered as a result. With two characters as memorable and unique as Kane and Lynch, I was sad to see the story - which took only 5 hours to complete - a bit lacking. Don’t get me wrong, Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days isn’t a bad game, it’s just not a great one.\n\nThe Co-Op Experience: Team up online or offline through the story in co-op with a friend. Play as Kane or Lynch and work together with a revival mechanic. Online play allows 8 players to rob a bank together in a Fragile Alliance that can turn co-op into competitive.\n\nCo-Op Score: 3.5 out of 5\nGeneral Score: 3 out of 5","July 11, 2011","true","75.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Its greatest strength is the style; similar to lo-fi handheld shaky cam. The setting of Shanghai is also well realised, showing the seedy underbelly with bustling streets and markets however in later levels it reverts to overused locations such as warehouses and docks.\n\nIt also suffers the same problems as Kane and Lynch: Dead Men, great characters but stale and awkward gameplay. Simple mechanics such as getting into cover can be tricky and the aiming is clumsy at times. There also aren't any real variants on the gameplay, often narrow alleyways where it's a repetitive game of whack a mole, popping in and out of cover until it's safe to proceed.\n\nThe recent Spec Ops had an interesting story to make up for it's lack of gameplay, Kane and Lynch Dog Days has two great disaster-prone characters but not a great story.\n\nIt's also so short the first time I completed it I thought it was the end of Act 1 only to realise it was the end of the game, and incredibly short single player campaign that ends suddenly.  Multiplayer isn't much better as it died a month or so after release and now it's impossible to find other players.\n\nThere are far better 3rd person shooters out there now such as Kane and Lynch: Dead Men, Max Payne 3 and Spec Ops which all do it better.

Thats a good thing, right ? Nope. Not here.  The story uses the same overused theme thats been done in movies and games since the beginning of games...revenge. Its predictable from start to finish which is kind of boring if you think about it. Theres no more character dept and Kane stops Lynch from learning more from each other right from the start, Personally I think its the biggest mistake that the devs made.\n\nFor the gameplay, I have to be honest what impressed me the most are 2 things. First is the enemy AI...It's brutal. If you take cover and don't look around you, the enemy will come up to you and ♥♥♥♥ you up. That is impressive since most AI will just stay behind cover and shoot you endlessly without anything more to do.\n\nSecond is the cover system. Far from perfect but at least this time I press C to activate it so in a very wierd way...its works. Since Kane & Lynch : Dead Men, the cover didn't work almost all the time.\n\nThe game forces you to change weapons since enemies don't use all the same weapon so its possible you'll run out of ammo for a specific weapon so you'll have to change. I personally don't mind that because it forces you to change strategy to kill your enemies (don't snipe with a shotgun) and you have to think about ammo conservation as well.\n\nLevel design is the most absurb thing besides the story of course. What you see is only Shanghai city...its the same view you get from room to room, to buildings to ... well everything looks the same. So level design is just really bad, boring not appealing at all.\n\nStory doesn't make any sense to me, why the hell are they staying in Shanghai ? Everyone in the city goes after them and the only thing they have in mind is...complete the transaction...stay here. WTF ??? It's just an excuse to use the same textures over and over....and I completed the game in 4 hours...shorter than the first one.\n\nSorry but this is not recommended. If at least they would of done a great job with the level design I would of recommended this.

For the best of you it will take you less than 3h to go through the whole story, multiplayer isn't good either and now is totally desert. The worst part of the game is the camera, it was design to look like someone recording with a camera behind your character it means that the camera is always shaking. Guns seems to shoot plastic bullet, the only weapon that seem to have "some power" is the shotgun but you can't use it as much as you'd like to. The AI is totally messed up shoot you through walls and covers.\n\n2/10","November 20, 2013","false","3.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fluffydestroy/recommended/28000/","fluffydestroy","Late Game Reviewer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fluffydestroy/","774 products in account","The first game finished so badly (one of the ending anyways) that it had to continue with Kane & Lynch 2. Thats a good thing, right ? Nope. Not here.  The story uses the same overused theme thats been done in movies and games since the beginning of games...revenge. Its predictable from start to finish which is kind of boring if you think about it. Theres no more character dept and Kane stops Lynch from learning more from each other right from the start, Personally I think its the biggest mistake that the devs made.\n\nFor the gameplay, I have to be honest what impressed me the most are 2 things. First is the enemy AI...It's brutal. If you take cover and don't look around you, the enemy will come up to you and ♥♥♥♥ you up. That is impressive since most AI will just stay behind cover and shoot you endlessly without anything more to do.\n\nSecond is the cover system. Far from perfect but at least this time I press C to activate it so in a very wierd way...its works. Since Kane & Lynch : Dead Men, the cover didn't work almost all the time.\n\nThe game forces you to change weapons since enemies don't use all the same weapon so its possible you'll run out of ammo for a specific weapon so you'll have to change. I personally don't mind that because it forces you to change strategy to kill your enemies (don't snipe with a shotgun) and you have to think about ammo conservation as well.\n\nLevel design is the most absurb thing besides the story of course. What you see is only Shanghai city...its the same view you get from room to room, to buildings to ... well everything looks the same. So level design is just really bad, boring not appealing at all.\n\nStory doesn't make any sense to me, why the hell are they staying in Shanghai ? Everyone in the city goes after them and the only thing they have in mind is...complete the transaction...stay here. WTF ??? It's just an excuse to use the same textures over and over....and I completed the game in 4 hours...shorter than the first one.\n\nSorry but this is not recommended. If at least they would of done a great job with the level design I would of recommended this. If you add everything with the bad levels, the game becomes unacceptable.","October 3, 2014","false","4.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The censored headshots turn a stomach far faster than the gory over the top madness of any other game that comes to mind. The visual style is bright, eyepopping, unique, will never be seen again due to gamers not being ready for the game when it was released.\n\nThis game is worth a playthrough if you want to taste blood, smell sweat, hate yourself.

Shots to the head or upper torso kill you instanty (in  Extreme  difficulty atleast). Shots to other body parts hurt you or knock you down.\n-  Nice setting.  You get a glimpse of the dangerous life in the dark alleys of Shanghai.\n\nCons -  The camera is horrible.  I don't understand what the developers were going for. The shaky portable-like camera during sprints and cutscenes was a bad idea. It didn't make the game any better, it makes your life more difficult. On the bright side, you can turn on Steady Camera.\n\n-  The aim system is bad...  I couldn't find a better way to put this. I know aiming a gun in real life isn't easy but the way it behaves in this game makes  Extreme  difficulty unnecessarily stupid. Enemies have incredible aim and range (they are police officers, SWAT agents and Shanghai gangsters after all), they can headshot you from a ridiculous distance or atleast kill you with a couple of shots. In my opinion, the least the game could do is let you aim your guns properly from the same range (or any range above 10 feet (~3 meters)) to stand a chance.\n\n-  Checkpoints are too spaced.  Yes, this is one of  those  games. You spend half an hour trying to get through a tough spot or a difficult situation where you're always outnumbered and outgunned, only to be killed by that last single ************. What happens? You start way back there, one or maybe two areas before that one. Again, really frustrating in  Extreme  difficulty.\n\n-  Graphics.  Not as relevant as the former cons but still. They aren't total garbage but they're not good either. Some edges and textures are poor and the shaky camera just makes it worse (or better if it can distract you from them).\n\nIn conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this to most people. If you like the chinese setting and/or old school clunky gameplay go ahead and try it. Or if you're that guy that wants to try every shooter out there, try it aswell. But don't say I didn't warn you :P\n\nOh and don't judge me on only 3 hours game time. I had played this before without Steam and I thought I'd play it one more time. Not one of my best decisions... I stand by what I've said in this review.","December 13, 2015","false","10.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Flowmad/recommended/28000/","Flowmad","Flowmad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Flowmad/","340 products in account","Its ok for a very high discount, but not really for € 10.-, let me explain why.\n\nIts pretty uninspired and very short (3-4 hours), its one of the worst sequel of this generation, its very insulting. The story is almost non existent, many plotholes and the game is basically "OH SH*T duck shoot duck shoot". The gunplay is not that good and thats a huge problem because thats the only thing you do in this game. Enemys take way too many hits and its hard to hit them in a long distance. If they hit you, you mostly fall down and you have to get back up, in the meantime you are a very easy target and you die fairly fast in this game, especially if some guy sneaks up to you and shoots you in the back. The coversystem is also a joke, you get hit so many times anyway. The AI is actually pretty bad, some enemys just stand in the open or take in open places cover and civilians sometimes just act like nothing is going on and walk casually into your shooting sight. Some parts are so hard because the game throws so many enemys at you that you can barely survive and there are also stupid escort missions (ugh...), all this probably because to extend the game lengh, but in a bad way.\n\nIt almost seems like the devs put most of their effort into the Multiplayer that no one wanted and cared about in the first place and also into visuals, irritating mobilephone filming filter effects and the annoying as hell shaking cam and called it "immersion", but actually forgot to make the mouths of the characters move when they talk in gameplay (they did in the first one actually). It also seems like they cut allot of content and ideas out of this game because of time isssius and rushed it out of the doors, there are some huge areas where you just run through and its nothing going on there. The ending is one of the biggest middle fingers in gaming i have ever seen, when you thought the game is finally about to start, it just ends without warning and lefts you with some stupid porn music in the credits and you're like "huh? What, thats it? THATS IT?! WTF?!".\n\nThey probably thought the Multiplayer will hold this game up and thats why there was allot of focus there, but no one is playing that anymore and thats not what the original Kane and Lynch was about. It was about the two antiheroes, one a professional criminal with a dark past and one a psychopath with mental blackouts, in a cruel and tragic storyline against a powerfull criminal organisation, all inspired by movies like "Heat". But they threw everything that made the first game good out of the window (the good characters and what made them interesting, engaging storyline, different locations etc.) and desided to make one generic immersive shooter instead and reduced the gameplay just into "duck, shoot, duck, shoot" with a annoying shaking cam and ugly filter effects which just looks cool in trailers but doesn't feel good in the game.\n\nKane and Lynch 2 improved nothing as a sequel gameplay wise over the original and made actually some things worse and the first one wasn't actually that good in the first place, but still much better than this. Where are the teammates which i can give orders like in the first one? There is only Kane, but he doesn't seem to do much and i can't give him any orders. In the first one we had multiple teammates that can revive you with a adrenaline shot for a second chance, but you would die of an overdose if you get another injection immediately after you had one already or if your teammates dont make it to your position in time. The only downside of this is that your teammates can die too and you have to revive them in time as well, that can be really annoying if they go down in a position with allot of enemy fire, but this does mostly only happen in later levels. There was also a system where you can change weapons with your teammates and give them the ones you want. This could have been improved in the sequel, but they desided to drop all this entirely instead and if you go down, you're just dead now, no adrenaline shot, not be able to change weapons with kane and no orders. In the first one we had splitscreen co-op on PC, but they removed it in the sequel and made it console exclusive. Why?! There is no reason to remove this, i don't get it if developers do something like that, especially if it was in the first one. They also removed grenades and smoke grenades which you were be able to throw and also the ones from your enemys back as well, but now we have fire extinguisher and oil containers which we can throw and enemys can throw them too. Its a neat idea, but there is no reason to remove grenades completely anyway. In the first one we had unique locations like the streets of an american city, the bank, the prison, the tokio nightclub, the skyscraper, the streets of tokio and also havana. In the second one we got the slums of shanghai, a skyscraper with an office and the airport, thats it! It was a game that had HUGE potential because of its predecessor, but they screwed up almost across the board.\n\nI was actually one of the people that waited for this game because i liked the first one allot, but i'm glad that i waited for the reviews and didn't bought it on full price. I'm still dissapointed though but not as burned as others because i had patience and waited for the price drop, this is why i'm glad that a platform like Steam exist. Later i found the Kane and Lynch 2 i wanted actually in Max Payne 3 which was ironically hated by the fans of the previous Max Payne games too. But atleast it didn't forgot its roots completely and its a great game with nice value and has a engaging storyline with interesting characters and awesome gameplay, like Kane and Lynch 2 should have been.","November 27, 2013","false","3.8"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","12","26","0","0"

All you do is cover, run and fire. I have played this game on Xbox too and thought maybe I should buy it and try to get into it again. Unfortunately that was not the case.\n\nPositives:\nHonestly..none.. zero...moving on..\n\n\nNegatives:\n- Game is badly optimised\n- Game crashes if you are "Online" on Steam, you have to be "Offline" in order to not crash at the main menu\n- Camera looks like a typhoon hit you while running (can't see anything and it moves everywhere)\n- Character falls over every 30 seconds for no apparent reason (no bullets hit you)\n- Voice acting is terrible, the quality of it too\n- Sounds are distorted, and often glitchy. (guy fires and only 2 seconds later you hear the gunshot, I run at 60+ FPS so It's not lag by the way)\n- You are dropped into the story like Square Enix "knows" and are "confident" you played the first Kane & Lynch. No information about what happened or how they got there is given\n\nWell, I'm not sure what happened while Square Enix were making this game. Honestly it is a great company especially for games like "Hitman Absolution" and "Just Cause 2" and so on. In my opinion this game may have had potential but it looks like a project that is only quarter of the way from being completed. It really needed to have more attention to it. But I guess this is the final Kane & Lynch game. If not I hope they will do much better on the upcoming ones/one.\n\nPLEASE NOTE\nThis is strictly my own opinion towards this game. People's opnions will vary depending on how much they played the game and wether or not they like this type of game of running, getting behind cover and shooting. It is not a game for everyone I will admit. But If you enjoy those types of games then maybe you can look over the certain errors and enjoy this game.\n\nRate: 2/10\n=eGO=™ DeMIZe","February 26, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

BAD GAME !\n\nOVERALL Have you forced yourself of finishing a game just to see if you get to enjoy it down the road? Well, that's what this game was for me, it's a really unrefined shooter and would never pay $10 for it, I got it in a bundle but wouldn't pay more than $3 for it, and even then I would rather expend the $3 on an indie game who will be over 5h of fun.\n\nREPLAYABILITY Once you finish this dull adventure and try to squeeze a little more of fun from it you may replay a couple of levels to get some achievements, I did so in about 35min just to convince myself to never ever touch this tittle again.\n\nGAMEPLAY The shooting is horrible unless you are using a shotgun at close range, assault rifles or pistols at mid or sniper at long, other than that forget altogether the SMGs unless you want to save some bullets and prepare to be frustrated with the low accuracy of the guns when they are in your hands and the ultra high precision they get on AI hands, seriously the reticle of the AI is perfect and you get one the size of a watermelon.\n\nAESTHETIC The visuals of your surroundings might be the best part of the game, and that's not something to brag too much about, however the character models are bland and don't look very good, shooting cars and some elements in the environment might be what gives your heart content at the end of the day, after gunning down your enemies of course.\n\nSTORY If you look at the big picture the story isn't THAT bad, but while playing it it feels very uninspired, there are parts that are really stupid and to make it worse you have to deal with some horrible animations and rather dull voice acting (the phone calls between chapters are the best voice acting you will get, I guess not looking at the stiff animations helped). In my opinion the story twists were pretty dumb, *SPOILER ALERT*  when you get caught and thrown into the garbage after been cut off by a butcher you were supposed to be dead, but no, you get back into the building and manage to kill the bad dudes with your bare hands...  that's the dumbest moment in my opinion.\n\nMUSIC The ambient sounds and gun shooting aren't bad, but in the end the score is pretty forgettable, you know, if there was any...","September 12, 2014","false","5.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sui_mach/recommended/28000/","sui_mach","Suicide Machine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sui_mach/","1040 products in account","A sequel to a 2006's generic third person cover based shooter - Kane & Lynch: Dead Men. You'd have think, that after a failure that was the first instalment of Kane & Lynch, IO Interactive would carefully analyse all the feedback and adjust to it. Sadly this isn't a case. While K&L2 no longer uses GFWL and allows to play cooperatively over the internet (finally?), it still has all the flaws of the first game. Hell - it even has few more.\n\nFirstly, Lynch's episodes of violent psychosis? No longer present in the game! It's kind of depressing that IO basically killed the most interesting (although, certainly - not positive) aspect of Lynch.\nWhat is also a step back, comparing to original is the music. Jesper Kyd - the composer behind music to Assassin's Creed, Hitman series and many others... no longer present in here. And sadly - a music of a new composer - Mona Mur doesn't really work. It isn't bad - it's just so easily forgettable.\n\nForgettable is also a word, that describes storyline of Kane & Lynch 2. After the first level, everything is based around the same idea - you trying to escape from Shanghai. It's "OMG, we have to get out of Shanghai... Lynch, let's get your girlfriend and then we go" (*level later*) "Plan failed... it's all your fault, Kane... she's dead... you've destroyed my life (blahblahblah) let's get out of Shanghai". How does it end? Kane and Lynch get to the plane and leave Shanghai.\n\nWhole storyline takes around 3-5hrs to complete, which is just a terrible length for a game, where singleplayer is focal point of the game. There is a multiplayer and you can play the game in COOP. Problem is - I was never able to find anyone playing anything except COOP. And while playing a game in COOP certainly helps - it doesn't even add much replayablity (at least nowhere near as much as COOP in most of shooters).\nWhat kills the game however is its gameplay mechanics and terrible visuals. I get the difference between aesthetics and graphics and I do understand importance of artistic vision. And to some extend I do admire it's interesting visual style. Problem is - all of the post-processing effects get in the way of gameplay. With all the intense lens-flare effects, noise, color correction etc. not only spotting enemies becomes difficult. It's hard to aim and shoot. And when you disable them - you are left with nothing but highly outdated graphics, that look like something from 2003 (although - aesthetically, Unreal Tournament 2003 still looked better than K&L2)\nShooting in K&L2 lacks impact and isn't satisfying. Combine that with a glitchy cover mechanics and you have 2 main reasons why K&L2 fails to be an enjoyable shooter. What makes the cover mechanics even worse is something what should have worked in game's favour - destructible environment. Destructible environment sounds cool, but sadly, you are the one that dies more often, because of it. And while games like BFBC2 or even Red Faction were able to make it work in their favor, in K&L2 it's just another frustrating feature.\n\nBottom line: Kane & Lynch 2 is a bad third person cover based shooter, that fails to provide entertaining experience. Avoid it, if you're planning on playing alone. It can be a bit of fun while playing COOP, but in that case - I recommend picking up Rainbow Six Vegas - it's at least equally as long, has higher replayablity, looks better, has better level design... hell, it even costs less!","November 25, 2013","false","14.7"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

In case anyone happens to read this in the first place.)\n\nKane And Lynch 2 is a good.. Well at the very least a competent third person shooter. It's almost literally like Payday The Heist/Payday 2 except that it doesn't have nearly as much depth or content as those two games mentioned before. That being said, I feel like this is still a better game than THOSE TWO GAMES MENTIONED BEFORE. Allow me to tell you why:\n\nPeople always complain and whine about the length of the Story in this one, yeah you can finish it in 2 or 3 hours, yeah it's very linear, yeah it's very repititive.. But at least this game has a f*cking story mode to begin with. Which Payday doesn't.. The reason why i'm comparing K&L2 to the PAYDAY series because they're so similar to each other gameplaywise.\n\nThe Characters, Kane & Lynch (who woulda guessed?) are also pretty cool and brutal characters.. Very interesting characters indeed since they're sort of evil people. The game has character development, does the PAYDAY series do any of these? Nah.\n\nAlso, the multiplayer mode is pretty decent if i do say so myself if it wasn't dead.\nIt's 9,99 Euros guys.\n\nPAYDAY 2 is 29,99 Euros.\n\nDespite the short story mode it's a good game. And the multiplayer being dead really isn't even that big of a deal considering you can play the Multiplayer with AI. And the friendly AI in this game manages just fine, compared to PAYDAY.

See the M rating, it doesnt matter because the entire game is censored, if you shoot anyone you get this mosaic box that appears.  There is NO way to disable this mosaic box making the game just feel like... a game, so theres no immersion.  Whats annoying is the graphics are great, someone took the time to make a great looking game, but everytime you shoot someone invisible parents step in blocking us from seeing the terrible violence.  Odd the game lets you shoot people but not see their shot bodies, this is something anomalous in gaming, unique to this game.  Look at the screenshots, notice NONE of them are censored.  Marketing wasnt stupid they only used screenshots that didnt include the censored in game footage because they knew noone would buy this crap.  Its time we kick out these game devs and put the marketing team in there making games, because these guys dont have a clue about game design.\n\nWatch ANY gameplay footage, K&L2 looks like its made by an 8 year old with a video editor, it uses EVERY filter making it almost impossible to see the game at times, from lens flare, to blood over your screen, static boxes, just open up a video editor see all those effects?  Their ALL in K&L2 with most being impossible to disable like that stupid censorship box.\n\nGet Kane and Lynch 1 since Kane and Lynch 2 sucks.\n\nRating:  0/10  Value:  $-9,999,999.00 (<---they should be paying us to play this kind of trash)","December 19, 2013","false","2.7"," 4 of 17 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","4","17","0","1"

Even at that price, I really can't recommend it.\n\nWhen I first tried playing the game, I got DESTROYED by run of the mill enemies that could seemingly shoot through my cover and flank me with the greatest of ease. I got frustrated and shelved the game for 5 years. I'm not sure what bug crawled up my backside, but I decdied to install the game and grind away until  I saw the game through completion.\n\nI really enjoy the atmosphere in this game, and I am probably one of the few who actually enjoy the 'shaky cam' aspect/angles they were going for. That is really where my enjoyment stops, though. The gunplay is dated, even for 2010. It takes a ton of bullets to take down normal civilians wearing nothing but clothes. You can take cover, but you will still be hit, and when you look out to shoot, you will nearly die... every time. It took me many tries just to get used to the shooting mechanics, and I failed over and over on the 2nd level of the game, completely frustrated. I got better as the game went on, and it became easier, but not any more fun.\n\nI've heard the multiplayer is really fun, but I can't bring myself to play any more of the game after the extremely lackluster single player campaign.\n\n3/10","January 30, 2015","false","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The shakey cam is a nice gimmick, but the angle leaves you with a very narrow field of view, at the end of the game (when playing with Kane) you vision is often completely obstructed by your character.","March 25, 2012","false","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It barely took me 6-7 hours to finish it walking around most of the time. Sad to see a bad review for this game since the first one, it could have been so much if time and effort would have been put in it as much as hitman for say. SquareEnix did a great job for the video aspect of the game, the documentary camera following style with blurish lights.\n\nThe game is pretty straight forward and feel kinda like a Hack-n-slash game but with guns and without levels, dont expect anything fancy as gameplay experienced as its lack of polishing. The shooting experience is also one of the worst out there even GTA wich is not a shooter game for say give players a better experience. The number of guns is very limited but it aint the problem, those guns just dont hurt much at distance and are so so so poor in accuracy that spraying is the best outcome.\n\nBut for say with all that the story is nice, if you dont minde a fancy ending, and kane and lynch are probably 2 of the best wingman out there, they are original and doesnt care for ♥♥♥♥.\n\nMy 2 cents, its not worth a full retail price, and its not worth the present full retail price, I would suggest to wait for at least a 75 % sales on it, wich happen often....\n","August 13, 2014","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The theme of the game gives you a feeling of raw brutal criminality. The characters is like taken out of a action movie, two hardcore old timers in shanghai to do an armsdeal with the chinese mafia. But  something goes horribly wrong and Kane and Lynch ends up being hunted through the streets of shanghai, and the run of their life begins to escape the chineese mafia.\nThe game graphics are ok, at times the extra graphics effects can be a little annoying. But you have options for that.\nThe gameplay can seem a little booring and at time a little monotonous for some, its a typical hallway run for cover type of shooter.\nThis game is for people that loves the criminal action hero type of theme game, and there is not a lot of those kinda games around.\nFor me the game is all about the theme, the characters and the city scenery. The gaming critics around the world slaughtered this game, and it was no hit when it was released.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MattzOrUK/recommended/28000/","MattzOrUK","Jade Luminescence | Calystegia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MattzOrUK/","860 products in account","One of THE worst games I have ever played in my life. What even is this?\n\nThis game is comprised of well, nothing. It's a 3 hour long game that's just a cover based shooter that is it. You go from room to room hiding behind anything you can in order to stay safe. You don't even need to come out of your cover because you can just fire around corners or over it with perfect accuracy.\n\nThere's also numerous problems with this game, there's around 10 weapons which range from useless or overpowered. However you do literally need to be on top of your enemy to actually land a hit as IO Interactive decided that all guns are accurate to about the length of a 15cm ruler. Any gore is actually censored for no apparent reason and the run mechanic pretty much gives you nausia after 5 seconds. They tried an attempt at a 'real life' run mechanic whereby the screen shakes all over the place like a 10 on the ricther scale is going down, adding super DOF with large amounts of light effects and motion blur. Another brain fart mechanic was the jumping over obstacles nonsense where you have to crouch and take cover behind the obstacle you want to climb then wait for the jump prompt to appear. Really? Add all those together and you have a cocktail that's so lethal, absinthe might as well be Robinsons.\n\nGame assets are constantly reused, one car park level everyone had the same BMW in the same colour. It made me wonder if they thought nobody would notice or that their "This game is not racist" statement when you load the game was trying to spell that China is indeed a knock off nation. Maybe that's why all of the guns were so innacurate too?\n\nIt seems that this game was born from two terrible franchises, Gears of War and the Dynasty Warriors franchise. Combine a tacky third person cover based shooter with hoards of SWAT that have no idea what they are doing from room to room and you create the love child that is Kane & Lynch 2. I'm not even going to mention one of the worst ending scenes in history so you can just play this monstrousity for yourself and live with the pain that I suffered.\n\n3/10, with even that being generous.","August 4, 2014","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The entire story played out like a DLC add-on that was difficult to follow. The characters are in a strange land, get in trouble, shoot their way out of trouble, then the game ends abruptly. The gameplay mechanics are OK, but the aiming is terrible. You have to get really close to enemies to land a shot. Otherwise the reticle on any weapon is too big. The weapons aren't very diverse either.\n\nThe whole game can be completed in ~4hours.\n\n4/10. If you were a big fan of the first game, then you'll probably want to play this.

I believe that many people were dissapointed with this game's lenght when they paid the full price.\nThe shooting mechanics are solid and fun, the action is great, the soundtrack is great too and atmospheric.\nThe game has a very unique art style, the whole game looks like a gritty amateur homemade movie shot by an unseen cameraman running after the player, complete with lens flares, distortions, blurs and even a shaky cam while sprinting which can be turned off. It's so bad it's good.\nThe game has a serious and mature storyline which gets kind of repetitive.\nIt basically goes like this:\n"Kane, come to Shanghai, I need your help."\nA few moments and dead bodies later...\n"Let's get out of here!"\nThe environments are detailed and look authentic.\nIf I were to review this on release it would be terrible due to it's lenght but for what I bought it I really can't complain\nThe game takes you throught 3 hours of of non-stop action which follows the same routine: cover, shoot, run, cover, shoot, run, repeat.\nThe game ends just as it was warming up and the ending is nothing thats worth mentioning.\nThe multiplayer is pretty fun and a mode called 'Arcade Mode' is included which is the Fragile Alliance multiplayer mode in singleplayer which is pretty fun and adds replay value.\nThe co-op is fun and worthwhile and may add to the replay value if you want to play with a friend\nOverall this game is recommendable only if it's on a sale, it is worth no more than £5 due to the linear short and kind of predictable story. But there are some memorable moments and fun gameplay as well as a great visual style. The game is like a gritty action movie, short but sweet.\nGood to complete on a boring night, buy it on a sale, play with a friend.","June 23, 2014","true","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The soundtrack really made you feel part of the situation and feel worried. Not to mention the soundtrack gave it a very dark feel too which I enjoyed very much. The story felt a little too predictable and has it's share of bugs and glitches. One of the major bugs I bumped into was in the last mission. When I had aimed down the sights of my gun, the whole screen went pink. It took me about 30 minutes of messing around with settings until I ended up restarting the game and it had seemed to work fine. I think it was the restart or the fact I was able to hit the next checkpoint. Towards the end of the game it'll get pretty challenging which I feel was pretty nice and bad. Enemys had more and more health and dealt more and more damage further in the game. On normal I felt like the last 3 missions were expert difficulty. So expect to die a few if not a lot, even on normal. So overall this game holds key it's atmosphere and it's ability to bring you in the game and really be embraced into the situation which I thought was really amazing. At the end of the day this game is a 8/10","June 23, 2014","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's always something.\nAlso, the story is better this time around.

I will admit that this game is not a walk in the park as some may believe as you can easily die in this game if you're just trying to go gun blazin', which is not a good advice to do. The character per say can use a bit more character than just the crazy guy and the semi-stupid guy which just follows around for the ride. This game give the player different locations throughout Hong Kong. I dont have much more time to follow up with more of my thoughts on this but i sincerely say and hope that you dont buy this game as i did, even if you just want to shoot people for no reason in China, just buy CoD (Call of Duty) or CS (Counter Strike) instead. Well thanks for checking my rating/review of this game and i hope it will decide if its worth your purchase.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SleepingShady/recommended/28000/","SleepingShady",">Fictionz<rofl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SleepingShady/","70 products in account",""Kane & Lynch 2 is definitely worth playing, as it's unique in a way where brutality, violence and misery of the protoganists crosses the line over perhaps any video game out there. IO Interactive is not afraid to step over it. A tip: Play it coop-compaign with a buddy, it is something you will not, I repeat not forget".\n\nAs you may be aware Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days is the sequel to the infamous Kane and Lynch: Dead Men, a mediocre cover shooter by IO Interactive(Hitman<3), notorious for being so bad it got Jeff Gerstmann fired. Really, it's not THAT bad. I mean it's pretty bad but I'm pretty sure I like it better than the first Uncharted at least. And anyways it came pretty close to having an interesting narrative. It starred two awful, irredeemable people(and not in the Booker DeWitt way where they're still cool and doesn't afraid of anything), one of whom has an estranged daughter. Like a lot AAA games this generation with a focus on story, it kinda fell short of its potential. 2, though, is something special. It feels like a singular artistic vision rather than a design-by-committee Frankenstein.\n\nDog Days takes place several years after Dead Men. Lynch is now living in Shanghai with a woman named Xiu, and works for one of the local crime syndicates. He calls in Kane to help with an arms deal. The game follows the two for 48 hours starting when Kane arrives. The very first level involves Lynch taking Kane along on a small errand to "send a message" to someone who's apparently been talking too much. Things get out of hand, the man in question leads them on a chase, the girl he's with ends up taking a bullet. The man then slices his own throat. This seems bizarre now but it will become obvious why he did it in retrospect.\n\n\n- The Michael Mann Connection: (Director; Heat, Public Enemies, Collateral):\n\nNow Dead Men took a lot of notes from Michael Mann movies, particularly Heat and Collateral, and did its damnedest to imitate that style to a tee. Honestly it does a pretty great job at it, with the club section and the Tokyo streets level in particular evoking iconic scenes with skill. Dog Days follows in these footsteps, but in its own way. For the past ten years or so, Mann has been shooting on digital instead of film, and using hand-held camerawork more often than not. K&L2 takes this and cranks that mother up, making a kind of grainy found-footage look.\n\nThat said, while Dog Days may model itself after latter-day Mann's aesthetic, it has much more in common with his 90's classic Heat. The mondo rad DeNiro/Pacino joint is about two men who can't conform to a normal way of life. They seek the thrill of The Score at the expense of everything else, including their loved ones(notice how Pacino's scene with the mother at a crime scene is more emotionally powerful and wrenching than anything to do with his family). Kane and Lynch are two men trying to reconcile the fact that their only verb is kill.\n\nContains probably the best quote from a video game I've ever played.\n\nGLAIZER: So how you like Shaghai, Kane?\nKANE: It's ♥♥♥♥ed. I hate it.\n\nKane and Lynch 2 especially has some of the best atmosphere and use of style I've seen in a shooter. Shanghai looks beautiful, yet gritty underworld, this seedy urban nightmare I find really intoxicating.\n\nVerdict:\nA real underrated title. I like its solid/no frills shooting and the visuals/atmosphere is one of the best this gen. Voice acting is top notch. A unique game overlooked due to poor reviews and media journalism, give this a go, you'll be doing me a huge favor!\n","July 4, 2013","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Shooting is more accurate (still a little fustrating at times especially when the bullets are not going where you aim), they added hit markers to indicate that you hit them and where. The levels are drastically better designed in this one, from the streets of Shanghai to the dirty cluttered sweat shops, everything is beautifully done giving you a sense of realism the last one lacked. The variety of weapons was definitely welcomed, there were several different kinds of pistols, machine guns, and shotguns. This game encourages you to experiment with each one to find out which compliments your playing style. They improved the cover system as well by simply giving a cover button, letting you control where and how you want to take cover, its way better but could use some tightening up.\n\nThe characters Kane & Lynch are better represented and displayed this time around, Kane is again hastily trying to rush to his own agenda (doesn't really contribute to the story beyond the point of telling us what happened to his daughter who we saved last game, and providing some assistence in fire fights), Lynch on the other hand puts on a pretty good show, I actually felt bad for the guy, he had his life together then all these bad events start to happen. There are plenty of memorable moments in this game, like when Kane & Lynch get sliced up all around thier bodies and they have to escape while running around completely naked. A lot of tense fire fights and action to keep you busy (which was one good thing about the first game), it rarely slows down to catch your breath, you always want to keep going and see what craziness is going to happen next.\n\nFor the most part this game was really good with only a couple of issues that bothered me, one was the camera, they were going for an amatuer filmed experience, its a great idea but in practice it got really annoying and bothersome, so I'm glad the developers thought of putting an option to disable it (steady cam). Its very shaky at tmes which can throw you off because the game has a lot of tense battles, you don't want the camera to assist the enemy, so I ended up turning steady cam on. Another thing thing that bothered me was again the lack of any real story, this game is a short experience (beating it took me 4.6 hours) and there is no reason to replay it unless you want the achievements for beating it on hard or extreme. So I'm confused to why they didn't try to throw some more story, whether learning more about the character's past or adding some information about the current relationships these characters have. There is really nothing here story wise which is a shame because I like this game.\n\nKane & Lynch 2 is a good game that I recommend giving it a shot, but since the multliplayer is dead the $10 price is pretty good, not worth $60. Playing co-op with a friend is also a great idea for a short acton packed experience.","February 16, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game will make you really think about the violence being carried out on-screen.\n\nThe two anti-heroes are also well worth the entry fee and their depressingly familiar descent into violence really makes you question where there's any good guys here.

The shaky cam is nauseating but the graphics look half decent. I just can't get into these games that glorify the dirt bags of society. No diamond in the rough, here. Just criminals being criminals.

It barely took me 6-7 hours to finish it walking around most of the time. Sad to see a bad review for this game since the first one, it could have been so much if time and effort would have been put in it as much as hitman for say. SquareEnix did a great job for the video aspect of the game, the documentary camera following style with blurish lights.\n\nThe game is pretty straight forward and feel kinda like a Hack-n-slash game but with guns and without levels, dont expect anything fancy as gameplay experienced as its lack of polishing. The shooting experience is also one of the worst out there even GTA wich is not a shooter game for say give players a better experience. The number of guns is very limited but it aint the problem, those guns just dont hurt much at distance and are so so so poor in accuracy that spraying is the best outcome.\n\nBut for say with all that the story is nice, if you dont minde a fancy ending, and kane and lynch are probably 2 of the best wingman out there, they are original and doesnt care for ♥♥♥♥.\n\nMy 2 cents, its not worth a full retail price, and its not worth the present full retail price, I would suggest to wait for at least a 75 % sales on it, wich happen often....\n","August 13, 2014","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Shooting is more accurate (still a little fustrating at times especially when the bullets are not going where you aim), they added hit markers to indicate that you hit them and where. The levels are drastically better designed in this one, from the streets of Shanghai to the dirty cluttered sweat shops, everything is beautifully done giving you a sense of realism the last one lacked. The variety of weapons was definitely welcomed, there were several different kinds of pistols, machine guns, and shotguns. This game encourages you to experiment with each one to find out which compliments your playing style. They improved the cover system as well by simply giving a cover button, letting you control where and how you want to take cover, its way better but could use some tightening up.\n\nThe characters Kane & Lynch are better represented and displayed this time around, Kane is again hastily trying to rush to his own agenda (doesn't really contribute to the story beyond the point of telling us what happened to his daughter who we saved last game, and providing some assistence in fire fights), Lynch on the other hand puts on a pretty good show, I actually felt bad for the guy, he had his life together then all these bad events start to happen. There are plenty of memorable moments in this game, like when Kane & Lynch get sliced up all around thier bodies and they have to escape while running around completely naked. A lot of tense fire fights and action to keep you busy (which was one good thing about the first game), it rarely slows down to catch your breath, you always want to keep going and see what craziness is going to happen next.\n\nFor the most part this game was really good with only a couple of issues that bothered me, one was the camera, they were going for an amatuer filmed experience, its a great idea but in practice it got really annoying and bothersome, so I'm glad the developers thought of putting an option to disable it (steady cam). Its very shaky at tmes which can throw you off because the game has a lot of tense battles, you don't want the camera to assist the enemy, so I ended up turning steady cam on. Another thing thing that bothered me was again the lack of any real story, this game is a short experience (beating it took me 4.6 hours) and there is no reason to replay it unless you want the achievements for beating it on hard or extreme. So I'm confused to why they didn't try to throw some more story, whether learning more about the character's past or adding some information about the current relationships these characters have. There is really nothing here story wise which is a shame because I like this game.\n\nKane & Lynch 2 is a good game that I recommend giving it a shot, but since the multliplayer is dead the $10 price is pretty good, not worth $60. Playing co-op with a friend is also a great idea for a short acton packed experience.","February 16, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Many people hate it, and i agree for the base price this game is not worth the experience. But as an experiement, and analysed as an artistic opportunity, all i can say it is that its an opportunity unfortunately wasted.\nThe art style of home-made, gritty hand-held camera footage works whonders for atmosphere and unique style, but the game itself is extremely unoriginal, uninspired, and all in all BORING.\n\nThat being said, if you are one to look past gameplay elements and bugs in order to enjoy a good story, you will be left wanting more. But not in a good way, more in the sense that they did not flesh out the story enough, and elements just DID NOT make sense. Its constant threat of death and danger just desensitizes the player after a short while, but granted, it DOES pace the action very well, with the intensity of firefights increasing as the story progresses. But in the end, its a potentially great game that ends up being wasted.","July 3, 2011","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't see why the game gets crucified by most reviews. Sure the story sucks, but the visuals and sound are incredible. I'm an artist that appreciates a unique visual/sound experience of complex ambient sound-scape layers generated from real city noises, vintage synthesizers, guitar amplifiers creating a vastly real world experience in the perspectives of a two drugged up inebriated criminals.  Two bad asses fleeing China after a botched arms deal in the international black market.  The gameplay feels more like an arcade shooter with an interesting set of complex disastrous situations to blast your way out of.  Replay value is found in the elaborate online co-op missions and reattempting the main story on the highest difficulty for maximum experience.  It's one of those games you love for sheer badassery of the experience over all other matters.

The soundtrack really made you feel part of the situation and feel worried. Not to mention the soundtrack gave it a very dark feel too which I enjoyed very much. The story felt a little too predictable and has it's share of bugs and glitches. One of the major bugs I bumped into was in the last mission. When I had aimed down the sights of my gun, the whole screen went pink. It took me about 30 minutes of messing around with settings until I ended up restarting the game and it had seemed to work fine. I think it was the restart or the fact I was able to hit the next checkpoint. Towards the end of the game it'll get pretty challenging which I feel was pretty nice and bad. Enemys had more and more health and dealt more and more damage further in the game. On normal I felt like the last 3 missions were expert difficulty. So expect to die a few if not a lot, even on normal. So overall this game holds key it's atmosphere and it's ability to bring you in the game and really be embraced into the situation which I thought was really amazing.

Because this game is nauseatingly generic and wants to be a movie really bad, it has that nasty framework that people are so fed up with these days, i.e: "corridor-shooting gallery-cutscene-repeat"\n\nBut here's where things might get a bit controversial: if you come in from the perspective of a movie fanatic, and review the game as if it were a movie, this game is actually pretty neat! It turns out that it works pretty well as a pseudo-movie.\nand since i didn't go in expecting a good game, and just wanted to see how the game handled that striking neo-noir theme its got going on. it actually didn't disappoint in that department.\n\nThe cinematography and level compositions are gorgeous. Gritty city decay contrasted against neon-spangled streets, all viewed through a wide angle lens camera with deliberate digital artifacts such as scanlines, noise, low bitrate, screen tearing, bokeh, light bleed, chromatic aberration and dynamic range fluctuations. the acting and pacing is on hollywood level and the soundtrack and sound design has a real sense of space and depth. It's field recordings of city noise interwoven with eerie electronic patterns and feverish soundscapes of pulsating drone.\nI personally think that it all is meant to convey the mind of lynch, and how he is hungover, miserable, confused, disorientated and detatched from reality.\n\nDefinitely something to check out if you're into neo-noir movies. if you can bear the gameplay that is. Its atmosphere felt reminiscent of enter the void or trainspotting, and if compared to games i would say i felt a bit of the hotline miami and max payne mood.\n\nThat's all folks!

This one’s SO good.\nThis is one the most atmospheric shooters ever made.  I don’t understand the bad reviews for this game because it is addictive and stylish and creates a feeling of tension and dread and exhilaration like no other shooter I’ve played, and I’ve played a lot of shooters.  The aiming is difficult but that’s what makes the game so unique because your shots will go astray meaning you really need to judge each weapons handling, recoil,  bullet trajectory and move to a position where the weapon can be best utilised. That’s what’s so great about this game is that it forces you to keep moving and create better angles and tactical positions with each fire fight you can figure out your own strategy. I played on the higher difficulties and it is very challenging and satisfying to think up a plan and execute it or try something else when it doesn’t work.\nThe game is short and repetitive but that’s the only negative. It has great characters, environments, graphics, phenomenal weapon sounds, tight game play, and rewards risk taking, strategy, and creative movement in a fire fight.\nIt’s a shame they won’t make a third because I would love to see another game like this with more weapons, items, maybe opportunities for stealth. But really, Kane and lynch 2 is already so refined you wouldn’t have to change much. I love the handheld shaky cam style of the game and the lens flare and just the general grittiness. I-O interactive needs to make the third one. Seriously.\n","May 14, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Oh yeah, 50% of all the times i looked i get shot isntantly with no time to shoot anybody.\n- SMG's.... they suck for you... but apparently the AI can headshot you from 100 kilometers distance without a sweat.\n- Shotguns should be a close quarters weapon.. can almost be used as sniper rifle.\n- It might be a 2010 game, but i've seen better graphics in games from before that time.\n- Somewhat boring characters.\n-There's no ending.. just a short cutscene with little to no content.\n\nMust say that the atmoshpere as a whole is quite dark, that's one thing i like about it. No heroic stuff like in so many games, and whole story isn't great, it's not bad either. Basicly it's just about 2 dudes who got themselves into some ♥♥♥♥, but that's it.\n\nSo buttom line is: Gameplay is choppy and buggy. Story is average.. AI is a bit stupid and predictable, but can also prove very challenging by headshotting you through cover. So, nope, won't recommend it. It's bad. And before you judge my review, yes i did complete the story mode. Replay value is zero.","May 10, 2015","false","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said, I am fully aware that Im one of the very few who think this way:). I do have my reasons, however. Firstly, the game possesses an atmosphere that very few developers can match, even to this date. Its gritty, unforgiving, brutal and very realistic/life-like. Even before I got to the ending, which basically confirmed my thoughts, I constantly felt like in a 1990s Michael Mann movie (Heat, anyone?). The shaky cam-style, along with its visual effects is another major plus in my book. Immersion is simply a given, the mechanic is not violated or overused. Voice acting is a third plus, but only if you consider the two main antagonists (cant really name them protagonists, now can we). So basically, I got so immersed in the world and the perdicament that the two psychos got involved in, that I forgave the game its length, its problematic game mechanics, heck, even the (at times) mediocre graphics. I did not really dwell on the fact that the characters are visualised in a less-detailed manner, the Shanghai setting sold me alone. I will not grade the multiplayer, as by now, it is totally dead, arcade mode is fun, but given the low number of maps, its a try-a-few-rounds kind of entertainment. To sum up, if you are into gritty, brutal crime stories told from a view point of two very despicable personas, Id say go for it:) I sure had fun with them.","April 2, 2014","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

MP is more straightforward, but is more involved than other shooters' MP modes. All are co-op/team based to an extent, but they all boil down to earning the highest score at the other criminals' (your teammates) expense.\n\nThe shooting feels appropriate, the cover shooting system is quite good (for a cover shooter) and moves at a very frantic pace. It's almost always easier to survive by moving over cover to get closer or to flank. The guns are interesting if not punchy, firing blindly from behind cover is possible, and fire extinguishers and gas cans provide meaty explosions when thrown and shot.

The ai has been improved, as has the cover system and hit detection.  What stands out the most about this title however, is the dramatic improvement in graphics.  The developers really have gone to great lengths to deliver a visual feast.  At times, the natural movement of the camera combined with the stylized but detailed graphics deliver an almost cinematic experience.  Like the original, Kane and Lynch 2 also featured an online co-op mode, Steam Overlay support, and of course widescreen resolutions.  The title is so improved over the original, I would endorse this title at full price.  Altogether the game is a solid choice at full price and a must buy on sale.","March 22, 2012","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The visual youtube snuff style is nauseating but clever and original. Voiceacting is nice like in the previous game and the plot is... well it's okay. The setting is totally cool nihilistic grimdark where there are no good guys. Some levels/scenes are worth experiencing. Kind of like the first game, where you had on the other hand some reeeeally awesome levels and the bulk of the game was horrendous crap.\n\nToo bad the gameplay itself is infuriatingly BAD. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ third person cover shooter. It even lacks the distant Max Payne vibe the first game had with all the bullet spray destruction. I paid like 3 eurobucks for this and it takes around 3 hours to complete, I wouldn't really pay more than that and the only redeeming quality is the "art" style.\n\nIt has the betrayal multiplayer too, tried it against bots and it's decent probably if you get a good group going but it starts to repeat itself after 30 minutes.","July 3, 2011","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is strongly brutal, but most of them are censored. Again, not everyone loves that. The story itself is just like a great movie which is a bit complicated.

Enemies after getting 5 hits to the head, fall down, 10 seconds contemplate if they shoud die, then stand up and run around like nothing happened. Your partner is idiot, leaving enemies to flank you from side and shoot you from behind, he takes the only valuable cover leaving you to run around in the open getting shot and if you manage to get good cover, he wil stand in your shot just when enemies are shooting at you. You are getting hit by enemies you cannot see from a weird angle even if you are in the cover. Character leaves cover when he wants to, causing a lot of situations when instead of moving he will leave cover and even if crouched before he will stand up.\n\nI wil try to finish the game for achievs, but curretnly I am contemplating really uninstalling it from my library.","February 8, 2015","false","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This happened multiple times throughout the game and closing to the main menu and trying it again usually fixed it.\n\nThe reason I stopped playing is because all of a sudden the cover system stopped working.

Even at that price, I really can't recommend it.\n\nWhen I first tried playing the game, I got DESTROYED by run of the mill enemies that could seemingly shoot through my cover and flank me with the greatest of ease. I got frustrated and shelved the game for 5 years. I'm not sure what bug crawled up my backside, but I decdied to install the game and grind away until  I saw the game through completion.\n\nI really enjoy the atmosphere in this game, and I am probably one of the few who actually enjoy the 'shaky cam' aspect/angles they were going for. That is really where my enjoyment stops, though. The gunplay is dated, even for 2010. It takes a ton of bullets to take down normal civilians wearing nothing but clothes. You can take cover, but you will still be hit, and when you look out to shoot, you will nearly die... every time. It took me many tries just to get used to the shooting mechanics, and I failed over and over on the 2nd level of the game, completely frustrated. I got better as the game went on, and it became easier, but not any more fun.\n\nI've heard the multiplayer is really fun, but I can't bring myself to play any more of the game after the extremely lackluster single player campaign.\n\n3/10","January 30, 2015","false","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls for going up to a cover spot need to be precise or else:\na)You don't get in the cover or\nb)You yet on the wrong side of the cover for enemies to shoot at you or\nc)You are in cover facing a way you shouldn't be and you can be shot at, yet cannot if you turn around.\nIt also seems to have to many shots to kill people, but I can probably write that of to my lack of skill more than anything.\n\nAlong with that some of the voice-overs/animations seems to be used too much. For example it seems to have 1 animation to slide open doors, 1 for helping up your partner.\nThe voiceovers seem to just be on loop at some point because I always keep hearing Kane asking where I was, Lynch yelling at the enemies not to mess with him. I get that this might have been trying to create a more emirsive experience (people checking if their partner is there to insure that they are not being sneaked up on, tension snapping, etc.) but it just seems a little bit too repetive at times.\n\nThe only debatably good thing I can say about this game is the art style. It seems to set the colours darker to try to make for a more serious tone, and brightens up the lights to contrast their movement in more urban areas.\nEven with this though I still have a problem with how it does the running sequence. When you start running, the screen starts to get reaally blurry (no this isn't because of my low end pc, this is an intended design choice). My problem with this is that you might be trying to get to another point away from enemies but because of this you might not see another enemy in front of you until it's too late.\n\nI would suggest that people avoid this game for now.","April 27, 2015","false","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now the beginning of this sequel had a lot of promise with it's cinematic feel and it's very realistic atmosphere - you feel like you're getting dragged into the game and caring for it's characters.  Unfortunately, this honeymoon period ends rather quickly with a very uninspired cover-shooter with a lack of fresh mechanics.  In trying to maintain realism, the game lacks any actual boss battles but this just means the gameplay is dampered by repeatedly shooting waves upon waves of generic enemies.  The camera becomes a problem in this thirdperson shooter - especially on cover mechanics where it won't shift over the left shoulder correctly at times and putting your avatar smack in the middle of the screen.  The hollywood-esque shaky camera is used often even when you begin sprinting which doesn't heighten the experience or make the action more frantic, it's just a cheap trick that invokes dizziness/confusion.\n\nNow the main focus of this game is the story - unfortunately it's like a hollowed out action movie's plot where it begins with some buildup then quickly deteriorates into "NOOOOOOOOOOO" territory.  The villians become one-offs that should just be dispatched like the hundreds of other faceless mooks rushing at you. The inbetween level voiceovers lose their charm after a few levels and 12 chapters later the game just abruptly ends with a credit screen into a return to the main menu and no actual closure.\n\nThe game had the high production values (for it's time) and the potential to be much bigger but unfortunately it falls short in my book and I couldn't recommend it to others unless they were real fans of the first game and wanted to see a continuation.","April 28, 2015","false","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I still enjoyed it. But part 2 was just bad, I was able to finish the story in some 2-3 hours and the MP didnt work very well for me... I liked the art style of the game, it managed to cover a lot of the games technical shortcommings, since at times all you see is blurry visuals and video artefacts, you dont see bad textures or crappy animations.

Don't do it. It's not even the kind of bad that's funny. It's just flat-out bad, the kind of flat-out horrible-ness that doesn't justify playing it even if you got it for free. What's wrong with it? Everything. Camera is awful in-game and in cutscenes. Storywise, I'm not even sure what's going on. Controls are clunky, and that's being generous. Gameplay wise it's about as entertaining as repeatedly slipping in a pool of liquified crap. Cover system works about as well as a potato works for cleaning your dishes. Half the guns can't hit anything within five feet of them turning shoot-outs into a horrible process of wasting ammo in the hopes that something will hit, or charging the enemy head on and using the ol' spray and pray. Health makes little to no sense with random blots of blood splattering all over your screen to confuse you as to where the enemy attacked from and just how much health it is that you have. Overall there's about a dozen different things to plague the experience at all times to make it as much of a chore as possible to trudge through the game. Do yourself a favor, don't play it.

It barely took me 6-7 hours to finish it walking around most of the time. Sad to see a bad review for this game since the first one, it could have been so much if time and effort would have been put in it as much as hitman for say. SquareEnix did a great job for the video aspect of the game, the documentary camera following style with blurish lights.\n\nThe game is pretty straight forward and feel kinda like a Hack-n-slash game but with guns and without levels, dont expect anything fancy as gameplay experienced as its lack of polishing. The shooting experience is also one of the worst out there even GTA wich is not a shooter game for say give players a better experience. The number of guns is very limited but it aint the problem, those guns just dont hurt much at distance and are so so so poor in accuracy that spraying is the best outcome.\n\nBut for say with all that the story is nice, if you dont minde a fancy ending, and kane and lynch are probably 2 of the best wingman out there, they are original and doesnt care for ♥♥♥♥.\n\nMy 2 cents, its not worth a full retail price, and its not worth the present full retail price, I would suggest to wait for at least a 75 % sales on it, wich happen often....\n","August 13, 2014","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I will admit that this game is not a walk in the park as some may believe as you can easily die in this game if you're just trying to go gun blazin', which is not a good advice to do. The character per say can use a bit more character than just the crazy guy and the semi-stupid guy which just follows around for the ride. This game give the player different locations throughout Hong Kong. I dont have much more time to follow up with more of my thoughts on this but i sincerely say and hope that you dont buy this game as i did, even if you just want to shoot people for no reason in China, just buy CoD (Call of Duty) or CS (Counter Strike) instead. Well thanks for checking my rating/review of this game and i hope it will decide if its worth your purchase.

All that changes is the look of their character model. And he shooting system is horrifically bad; machine guns will miss constantly as you fire but shotguns can pull off a surgical headshot from three rooms away. Objects have strange collision dection too, so many times you won't be able to shoot an enemy despite seeing a whole arms sticking out from behind a car's hood. It's the most bizarre hit detection I've seen in an FPS.\n\nThere's no music and virtually no story either. Kane and Lynch just run around a few corridors over an over in an attempt to pull off one last heist and retire. Obviously things go wrong early on and the remainder of the game is running from A to Z while you listen to some of the worst dialog I've ever heard in a buddy game storyline. Someone made the brilliant decision to film this game as if it were taken from Michael Bay style security footage. It's god awful and make running a chore (not to mention any time it zooms in on a character model you want to cry at how horrible the graphics are).\n\nStay away.
