"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blaxpirit/recommended/211260/","blaxpirit","BlaXpirit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blaxpirit/","516 products in account","They Bleed Pixels is a side-scrolling platformer with fighting elements, set in a creepy environment.\n\nThe platforming is great. Nothing too fancy, though. There are double jumps, wall jumps. A couple of fighting moves are reused as platforming moves. Some walls cannot be clinged onto. The platforming by itself cannot compete with something like Super Meat Boy, but doesn't fall too far either.\nWhen getting hit, in most games the character typically gets a period of invulnerability. It's just a trick to simplify the programming of the game. They Bleed Pixels avoids this. For example, hitting a blade saw throws the character away.\nAnother thing to point out is spikes act like spikes. You can even walk in between them, as long as you aren't actually getting impaled.\n\nThe controls are impressively elegant. Directions + 2 buttons is all you need to perform about 20 different actions. They may have gone a bit overboard with this, though, because sometimes you will end up doing something different than you meant. But you have only yourself to blame.\n\nThe enemies are just so original, and their AI is flawless. They will always find ways to annoy you, especially when there is a saw moving towards you, or you're about to slide off to your death. The full arsenal of abilities will be needed to deal with them. Everything fits together perfectly. You can even block some attacks (of course, there is no separate block button).\nAn important part of the game is environmental damage. It is preferred to normal attacks, and is much more powerful. And there really are many ways to make enemies hit those spikes.\n\nThey Bleed Pixels is a difficult game for sure. But there is a slightly easier novice mode. And, of course, challenges and bonus levels of all kinds, with varying difficulty, up to extremely hardcore. There are achievements for collecting all the "books" on a level, each of which is a challenge by itself, no-death runs, speedruns and more. The game can be really competitive. Big replay value.\n\nGraphically, the game looks great. Nice pixel art, especially the backgrounds. Not everything is perfect, but the animations make up for it. Cutting through the enemies feels great.\nThe soundtrack sure is strange, a bit morbid, based mostly on repeating catchy (chip)tunes. But it's fitting, and I really liked it. Sound effects are nice.\n\nI encourage people who for some reason gave up on this game, to give it another try. It appears the entire game was rewritten at some point.\n\n★★★★★★★★★☆","May 31, 2015","true","13.9"," 57 of 61 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","57","61","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/qcxv/recommended/211260/","qcxv","Glypha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/qcxv/","982 products in account","They Bleed Pixels is a challenging wall jump platformer, with a satisfying unique premise, quality combat and engaging mechanics.\n\nYou control a presumably troubled student at the Lafcadio Academy for troubled girls. She stumbles across a magical book that makes you have wild dreams involving a few strangely horrific creatures, several bloody spikes, and an ever present number of saws. The book also has glowing bits and pages that not only are missing, but found inside said dreams. Take heed of any such events that occur in reality, as these are not normal behaviors for books or their pages.\n\nThrough mysterious circumstance you have grown claws, which is so awesome that we will refer to this character as clawgirl. Also you become purple, which is a color associated with royalty, Roman Emperors, plums, and according to the Simpsons is itself a fruit. Clawgirl now likes to claw and kick levers and assorted Eldritch horrors, as she navigate your fun dream world with silky mechanics and enough cool moves to enjoyably and reliably get the job done. These moves include the downward thrusting fall, the slide on the floor, and the rat-a-tat-tat hit-you-in-the-air maneuvre. A clever mechanic in this game is the check point system, as a new checkpoint can be placed down whenever a sufficient amount of combo bar has been activated, where combo can be gained by elegantly and rhythmically dismantling opponents, or picking up little globules of blood that are scattered around the world as if left by a crime spree in space. On occasion this has led to taking perhaps a more difficult path to simply save earlier to avoid redoing portions of a level.\n\nThe levels involve clawgirl moving from the beginning to the end in what is often a circuitous and meandering path. You accumulate pints, in opposition to the classic of points and referencing the games appreciation of blood. There's a fair amount of pixely blood in this game, and it's always fun. Most of it will be spilled by you of course, especially if you intend to complete the challenges for each level of gathering the grim harvest of all the blood pickups, or the 6 book pages on each level. The blood pickups mostly involve a finesse of controls to navigate while collecting them all, serving to increase the overall number of jumps, and occasionally up the difficulty of those jumps. The pages are of significantly higher challenge for the level, serving to provide interesting navigations that can intrigue or frustrate, depending on your underlying psychological dispositions.\n\nThe game plays out over a prologue, three chapters with three levels each, and an ending sequence. These will take a fair amount of time to beat for players of most skill levels, with a significant ramp up in difficulty over the course of the game. There are also a number of created levels for those with more voracious appetite for content.\n\nThe graphics of this game involve a pleasant pixelated layer upon which the game mechanics plays out, and a fascinating background layer that is often quite a surreal, tesselated treat. The music is of a high bit-sound quality, fitting the grim aesthetic of the game and is sufficiently varied that it never wears on your soul with repetition.\n\nThis is a well made platformer that will entertain grizzled veterans of the genre with its challenging, engaging dynamics and delightful Lovecraft inspired aesthetic. Non-afficianados may find themselves frustrated with the difficulty, and leaving after a few levels, but not after spending sufficient time with the game to justify its purchase.\n\nThis review provided in accordance with international treaties established in accordance with all applicable sovereign entities.

When it went on sale I eargly grabbed it and...was just so disappointed. I was looking forward to a challenging plat-former with an interesting visual style. Well I certainly got something "Challenging" but for all the wrong reasons. The game is artificialy difficult. The whole thing is basically like those Super Mario hacks where the game is almost impossibly hard because the person put a lot of effort into making sure you get screwed over at every turn. I couldn't tell you how many times I died because something popped out at the last second from hiding, and would demand the reflexes of a coked up 8 year old to dodge on the first try. Which bassicaly turns large portions of the game into less of a plat-former and more of a memorization puzzle with the added difficulty of having to jump around.\n\nThe game employs a unique check point system, when you have absorbed enough blood you are allowed to drop down a check point which heals you and allows you to continue from that sport if you die. The only limiting factors are that you can't be moving, and can't be near a saw blade or an enemy. And because of those two factors a good portion of the time these check points were useless because the developers would place a random saw blade, or cover EVERYTHING in slippery goo to make sure you can't actually stop moving and drop a check point. Forcing you to do large portions of a level without being able to employ a system the developers put in. In some cases I wondered why the check point system existed because 80% of the level was created so I couldn't drop a check point at all. It's pretty frustrating to have that purple glow around you indicating you could place down a check point and take a breather, only to notice that there is NO where to drop it down.\n\nJumping is a big problem. Under normal circumstance the jump and double jump work fine but when you attempt to double jump off a wall, if you do it wrong, the double jump fails. As far as I can tell its a timing issue, you need to cling to the wall for the right period of time to be able to jump off it an then perform a second jump. It's only a fraction of a second difference between getting your double jump and not. Normally this isn’t a big deal but it you're getting into a groove, or you NEED to go fast to get past a part this becomes a huge problem. It turns some parts of the game into an annoying game of timing the wall jumps juuuuuuuust right so you're still moving quickly, but cling to the wall long enough to perform the second jump you need.\n\nCombat can be fun at times; kicking an enemy into a saw blade is immensely satisfying. However this part of the game also is greatly flawed. the developers like to throw lots of flying enemies at you while you're performing difficult jumps. Which make sense in a game with combat, only they don’t give you any way to dispatch these enemies, forcing you to try and complete already difficult platforming while also dodign enemy attacks. Usually I had to get part way through a tricky jump situation, then double back so I could dispatch the flying enemy who followed me. It made difficult jumps tedious and frustrating. As for normal combat, everything gets the kick. Really, there isn't much more complexity to the game than that. Kick an enemy into a trap or kick them into the air and air juggle them. That's as complex as the game gets. Even when fighting multiple enemies just kick them all into a corner, kick them all into the air, and air juggle them all. At first combat was fun but after a while the lack of variety became really boring. Most of the time if I didn’t need a check point I avoided combat because despite how easy it can be sometimes to dispatch enemies, other times its really hard because of the broken controls.\n\nThe game has no invisibility frames so its not only possible you can get killed in a few seconds by one enemy who got in a bunch of hits or a trap you bumped into, its a guarantee its going to happen. And the knock back from taking damage is ridiculous. Its not so bad for enemies, but for traps it makes no sense and is extremely frustrating. If you land on spikes you jump up and way from them by about 3 pixels, meaning you will die on those spikes because the odds of being able to jump away are slim. Its pretty pathetic dying on a single set of spikes because being damaged by them doesn throw you far enough away from them to actually do anything about it. Saw blades are the total opposite, one of those babies touches you you go FLYING! and its pretty much a guarantee that if the blade doesn’t kill you, where ever it sends you will.\n\nThe game is challenging, yes, but because of bad design. The entire game is just a test of how perfect you are able to play the game, because yes, you HAVE to be perfect in what you do for many parts of the game. No room for error, or creativity. You have to do it exactly as the developer intended. It makes for a frustrating and boring experience. I’m glad I got it on sale and didn't waste more money on it.","July 7, 2014","false","11.8"," 68 of 100 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","68","100","3","2"

But obviously I was not talking about money. I was talking about time (which equals money) but let talk more about why I came to such a conclusion.\n\nSo if you have read my previous review you probably guessed that I like this game because it is a 2D platformer.  And yes I like platformers and I was collecting them in the past when I had time to play any games. Naturally I came across this game and loved it at first sight. And why not? I watched the trailer and I saw fast paced action, lots of different moves and attacks. I loved this simplistic but beautiful art style. It also said it was inspired H.P Lovecraft which told me absolutely nothing at first but after searching online I know all I needed. Another thing that got me really excited was the number of achievements to unlock. And my friends know that I'm a achievement-junkie. But I should have read what those achievements are about. From the tags I new it wasn’t going to be easy and I was quite ready for that. So I grabbed my controller, fired up the game and focused on my TV screen...\n\nAnd it didn't start by killing me in first 30 seconds of gameplay. Well, it started with some spooky pictures that told me the story. And the way it introduce the story was actually pretty nice. So after brief loading I was in the game ready to demolish my foes in many different ways. But first I had to figure out how. And it was really easy to pick up the controls. It actually guides you through different moves and actions as you encounter different enemies and game objects. The learning curve was not steep at all and I felt like I was progressing pretty well. I was not dying as often as I expected from a difficult game and that's partially because I was ready for it and tried my hardest to master timing and precision as fast as I could. And the latter is very important. And you will need a controller if you want that. And game developers recommend that too when you start the game. I ran though first few levels feeling pretty confident but I was about to see what this was really like.\nAs I was going further and further the game was getting harder and harder. Platforming required more and more precision and did the wall sliding. So at this point I really started having a hard time because my fingers being somewhat precise clearly weren't precise enough for the game. So I started my intense training. I tried the level again and again and I was getting better and better. And you know those games that don't have any saving points in the level. Well this is not one of them, fortunately. I'm infinitely grateful for the checkpoint system. And you can get as many checkpoints as you want as long as you collect enough points by killing the enemies in style. This is an amazing game mechanic and it allows you to place the checkpoint anywhere you want but you need to be careful to not to get killed while you're trying to find a perfect spot to save. There are some infuriating enemies that can make you want to cut the gamepad cord with you teeth but don't you worry because I found a key to dealing with any enemy. And that is staying calm. It may sound like a silly thing but it really helped me. After few stupid deaths I tried again but this time I was planning my actions just little bit and I was trying to relax a little because I felt I was clenching the controller way to hard. Apart from the enemies each level is sometimes your biggest enemy and can be really challenging just to get through. And there even are levels with almost no enemies which should make it easier but I makes it harder instead because it's harder to gain points and place a checkpoint. Unfortunately there is only one boss - the final boss. And even though I found it underwhelming to defeat I felt incredibly satisfied.\nThere are more things to do in this game. Collecting book pages for example that unlock art and achievements. There are also bonus levels which I found quite fun. And I plaid all the levels several times to find those pages some of which are well hidden.\n\nSo what was the price of all that satisfaction for me. Well it was 31 hours. I will need at least 10 more hours to get some more achievements I feel I can unlock.  That's for a game that doesn't have too many levels. And was it worth it? You're god damn right it was. I feel like this game was priced too low and I would paid even if it was twice as much money.\n\nI do recommend this game. But ther are few things you should be aware of before buying.\nIt's insanely difficult for average player. Me, for instance. If you are not careful you will die a lot. Soundtrack is great and it is just right for this game but I can hardly hear it because I die to often. By now I have 2 levels to complete. It took overal 15 hours and not all of those hours were pleasant. Also I highly recommend a gamepad for this game.\nThis game will put your hand-eye coordination to the test and not only that. Please note that only 4.5% of people who bought it  completed it.\n\nMore reviews from Gameaways Curator","November 28, 2013","true","43.7"," 36 of 47 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","36","47","0","3"

I enjoyed the style, as well as the cute story that unfolded. The combat is interesting and it certainly feels satisfying to kick your enemies up in the air, in to a sawblade. Its really fun to dash to an enemy and proceed to stab stab stab like no tommorw. The music is nice and it makes me feel like I'm playing a platformer on a DOS system, which felt nostagic. It also has an interesting mechanic that allows you to create your own checkpoints. As I said my first impressions were positive, however, this game is ruined by overly twitchy controls and, in my opinion, sloppy level design.\n\nIts really disappointing too, because I really wanted to like this game. I love the art style, and the combat is fun, but I just couldn't get past these huge faults. The game is difficult as you might guess, which is fine. I do enjoy being presented with a challenge. I enjoyed Super Meat Boy for the same reasons. The early levels of this game aren't to bad, but the further you get in the game the more it requires you to pull off precise and complex maneuvers. You'll have an extremely hard time with this, because a mere nudge of the joystick sends the main character flying across the screen. The controls are just so twitchy. Whats worse is some levels have slippery floors, so now you have to deal with slippery floors, and the overly sensitive controls. To be fair I'm using a Logitech controller, and maybe it plays different based on that, but I've never had this problem in other games.\n\nThe level design is sketchy in some places, but a majority of the levels I encountered have a long drop with a pit of spikes at the bottom. This can be frustrating because if you make a mistake, you have to watch the entire fall until you hit the spikes, which doesn't sound like much, but trust me after several deaths watching that fall will test your patience. You can't skip it either you have to wait till you die before you can start over. You are given three points of health, but 80% of the time you'll die instantly (Especially to sawblades, they knock you all over the place, draining all three points in seconds). Having that extra health usually just results in dragging out your death, and I find myself just mashing the revive button once I fall in to a pit of spikes I can't escape.\n\nI sincerely wish I could tell you I enjoyed this game, but Those finer points just destroyed the experience for me. I wouldn't reccommend picking up this game unless its on sale and you really really like the style. Otherwise its not worth your money.","June 6, 2014","false","3.2"," 70 of 107 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","70","107","2","5"

Together these combine with the combo system and the environmental hazards, that chop up you and foes with equal fervor, to make huge pools of bleeding pixels and gibs that drip and bounce all over the beautiful place.\n\nSpending your time double jumping or wall hanging over and around a million spikes or razor discs is a joy... once you finally make it. But there's no blaming the game for your 180 deaths and 60 minutes to get through a 5 minute level (yes, I saw your screenshot, well done you). Once you've mastered the systems of movement and figured out how to chain together huge combos, the real fluidity of the game unlocks and you are free to maneuver yourself to the top of the leader-boards.\n\nCollecting orbs or killing baddies you fill you checkpoint meter, once full you can stand still and as long as there aren't any obstructions (bad guys, razor discs) you can create a check point to return to when you die.\n\nThere are no other check points so without these you will be zapped right back to the start of the level at death. Your character does have three hearts, getting hit by a baddie or touching an obstacle will cost you one, lose em and die, drop a check point and they refill and you can move on.\n\nIt's an interesting system but you can quickly see the only real difference between this and a standard checkpoint system is that the game is telling you where you can't check point instead of where you can, also as you become good at the combo system you can make almost constant check points, but your good enough at that point you wont need to or even want to as your score is doubled when you are holding a checkpoint but don't use it. The level recap screen also gives a bonus for not using any checkpoints at all!\n\nSome fun extras are included for every 3 out of the 100 plus achievements you unlock you can unlock a piece of artwork, some concept, some photoshop manipulation, some original art post process, all very very well done and a treat for the eyes. If you pick up the collectors edition you also get the sound track to the game on your hard drive, which is also quite good. 10 hours already I'm totally not sick of it, it's even caught in my head a bit. Especially how it slows down a little as you die again and again.\n\nThe game may be a bit short on levels but at 9.99 and with so many actual achievement achievements and competitive leader-boards it generates a lot more value. Also included are two levels that have been re-skinned by other developers/game makers with more promised on the way as coming soon.\n\nAgain, They Bleed Pixels may not be for you... Do you like cursing? Do you break things or hurt family members feelings when you get angry in a game? Even if those things are true, the elation at completing a level and meeting a goal you set for yourself (like not dying or... only dying 10 times, or beating a speed run time) is what games like this are for, and this one does it quite well.\n\nThere will be pixels!","November 30, 2013","true","17.8"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","23","30","0","0"

Levels get tough real fast (this has been rectified by a rewrite; see below.)\n\nUpdate (2015/06/03): TBP has gone through a substantial rewrite over to a new engine.  It's now cross-platform, lighter on the system resource, and runs at 60fps (was 30.)  It also features brand-new leaderboards with playback ability, and two additional bonus levels.  Special novice difficulty levels, which are a subset of re-balanced earlier "full" levels, are also introduced to ease the player into the game mechanics.\n\nI usually don't care much for precision platformers, but TBP was a welcome exception.  The main reason was, cruel as the game may be, it plays remarkably fair.  The enemies and deadly traps communicate clearly to you with visual and aural cues, with anticipation time long enough for you to react.  So when I died, I knew it was due to my poor judgement or execution, that I could do better next time.  It reminded me of the first 2D Prince of Persia, in a good way.\n\nAlso, the dynamic checkpoint system comes in real handy - you can set one down anywhere (with reasonable limitation and cost,) which effectively split a level into shorter, manageable chunks that you can practice on.  It's kept between game sessions as well, so you can always pick up just where you left off anytime.  I certainly wouldn't have lasted without it.\n\nAnd when all else fails, you can always unleash your trusty claws and vent your frustration on the nameless things that wander about in your way.  Which also grants you more checkpoints then health refills, so it all adds up to a surprisingly encouraging play experience, despite all the bloodbath and body counts.  Make no mistake; you *will* die often - and so will the enemies.  It's all fair and square, and there's certain grim beauty to it.\n\nI heartily recommend TBP to anyone with an intrepid mind who takes pleasure in the mesmerising recursion of experimentation, realization, and execution.

Unfortunately, They Bleed Pixels just doesn't nail it, suffering from terrible combat control, lousy hit detection, and an I Wanna Be The Guy mentality when it comes to enemy placement and level design.\n\nThe two-button (attack and jump) approach simply doesn't work for this game. There are too many different types of attack and defensive actions all assigned to one  button. Using the wrong attack happens far too often, and large portions of every stage in the game feel like they're designed purposefully around the idea of you using the wrong attack. The way slashes and kicks are set up is entirely backwards from how one would want to actually use them. It just feels like bad design on purpose on the part of the developers.\n\nWhen controls aren't the issue, lousy hit detection on the 800,000,000 buzzsaws you'll see (and moving spike pillars later) in the game will be a constant thorn in your side. It's especially bad when the game is asking you to navigate tight corridors and make pixel-perfect wall jumps anytime a stationary or moving buzzsaw is around.\n\nYour patience will likely be worn thin by the final 4-5 stages of the game and how positively ludicrous the stage designs and enemy and trap placement are. It stops being challenging in a satisfying manner and starts feeling really mean-spirited and unreasonable on an I Wanna Be The Guy level, especially given how terrible the controls are.\n\nPlay something better. Like Pid.\n\n(I also have NO IDEA how I earned "The End Immortal" achievement.

This gorgeously gore-filled 2D platformer will push you to your breaking point with its incredibly challenging level design and merciless enemies.\n\nThe game places you in control of a young school girl who stumbles across a mystical book that places a curse upon her that causes her to morph into a mutant purple demon with “Edward Scissor-hand”-esque blades for hands when she falls asleep. She then enters a beautifully animated horror filled nightmare that is filled with monsters and creatures of the night. She is then put in the unfortunate dilemma of fighting her way out of these nightmares before she’s sucked into them permanently.\n\nThe artwork is very well done and beautifully blends pixel art with paper and ink textures, the game looks especially stunning when you brutally kill an enemy by pushing them into a saw blade and have their bloody pixels sparkle and decorate your screen. The dark atmospheric environments help set the gothic tone of the game. The game also features a dark groovy electronic music soundtrack that pairs perfectly with the artwork and helps sets the games tone.\n\nThe games combat system is incredibly simplistic, yet at the same time very deep. While there aren’t any long lengthy combos to chain together or memorize, there are plenty of ways to kill enemies. All attacks are executed by clicking one mouse button, but the timing, direction, and ways you interact with the environment provide an ample amount of ways to brutally vanquish the enemies. One of the most interesting aspects of the game is the way that the checkpoint system works; Instead of having set predetermined checkpoints laid out in the levels, you have to earn your checkpoints by filling the meter at the top of the screen by collecting orbs and killing enemies. The more brutally you kill an enemy, the more points you get towards your checkpoint meter, so creativity is certainly rewarded. This checkpoint system helps take away from some of the difficulty related frustration associated with precision platformers of having to replay the same sections of levels over and over, but the game still offers a great level of difficulty.\n\nThey Bleed Pixels is undoubtedly one of the finer platforming experiences you will find on PC. Offering a gorgeous art style, incredibly challenging level design, fast paced combat system, innovative checkpoint system, and dark and adorable story and characters. While you will die repeatedly and be forced to play levels over and over, you will feel incredibly satisfied with yourself when you manage to overcome the games challenging difficulty.\n\n\nhttp://noobsthatplaygames.com/","February 25, 2015","true","2.0"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

Controls are tight, well tuned, and of course rebindable.\n\nThey Bleed Pixels is a harcore platformer which meets the requirements for making it stand out from the current 6,000 titles on steam which include:\n\n1. great art style - the asthetic for this takes a strong Lovecraftian tone to the enviroment and with the 'Crimon Update' everything runs exceptionally well with the pixelated blood bouncing all over with each stab. And the cutscenes included while maintaining an appealing pixel graphic detail and everyone seems to love the main character\n\n2. appreciable soundtrack -  I'd say most of the songs in this game are notable and interesting, however there are a few here and there that can come of as a regular chip-tune but nothing to really sneeze about.\n\n3. straight-forward controls - like I recently stated controls work fine with minimal button functions being left, right, jump, duck, and attack. the attack button can be used in multple fashion.\n\nThey Bleed Pixels is about a girl who goes to a school for troubled young girls run by an eerie headmaster. She finds a book and is suddenly taken to a strange world and her hands are replaced with sharp red claws. You start out with the tutorial but are quickly taken into combat where you conflict with 5 different enemy types. There's a score system that earns you 'pints' once you get enough you'll be able to cast a save sigil and this is how you'll be able to save and regain your health as long as your on stable ground and there are no obstructions nearby. getting pints depends on your combo meter and how you kill enemies, there's a large variety of combos giving plenty of grueseome death to your foes.\n\nNow this is still a hardcore platformer and you can not only wall jump but you'll also be able to stick to solid walls. there's plenty more score as well base on how many kills you got, how fast it was done, whether you died or took damage, and how many pages you got that are scattered through each level.\n\nNow one of the obstacles that may end some people's games are the sawblades, these things are your true enemy as when you hit one of them you'll bounce off in any random direction almost ensuring instant death in the proccess. This I'm sure is what some people get upset about when playing through. The levels themselves are individually unique, very long, and quickly ramp up in difficulty in each one adding more obscatcles and enemies. There's a good amount of content including well over 150 in game achievements that unlock extra levels and artwork made by the community.\n\nThe devs themselves for this game know what their doing and have always been able to respond to any questions I've seen pop up in the discussion thread, I haven't seen many game devs reach over to their fanbase before as much as the two who built this title before even while their finnished working on this one.\n\nOverall it's a good experience if you're in to the SMB level and stlye of gaming, it's not something for everyone of course and does require a lot of patience but has a fantastic sense of gratitude when you complete that one section or level that isn't quite common, and that is why I feel confident enough to reccomend this game.","September 9, 2015","true","59.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

There's no real plot, story, character depth or anything else here, it's all about the platforming.  The game would be good if not for 2 big problems.\n\nFirstly, the buzzsaws.  The hit detection on them is awful.  You don't have to touch them to get hurt by them, the game seemingly decides at random whether you touched one or not.  This wouldn't be a huge issue except that every time you touch one, it sends you flying across the room into something that will kill you right off or into something else that will send you flying across the room into something that finishes you off.  Essentially, touching any buzzsaw is a death sentence, especially in the later stages.  This becomes frustrating when you seemingly get killed or get past them by random chance rather than skill.\n\nSecondly, the controls.  Every attack is controlled by one button/key (I used a controller, but you still use one key for all attacks if using the keyboard), and the game often gets confused by what you're trying to do, which inevitably leads to your death.  Using a controller, pressing B does a kick that sends enemies flying sideways.  Holding B does a kick that sends enemies straight up in the air.  Pressing left/right and B at the same time does a dash attack.  Holding left/right and pressing B does your claw attack.  Holding left/right for a second or two and pressing B does your dash attack as well.  See the problem yet?  Too many times, you press right/left and B meaning to do a claw attack and you do a dash attack.  Other times, you press them at the same time and it does a claw attack instead of a dash attack.  Sometimes you hold in left/right for a second or two and press B and it will do a dash attack, sometimes it does a claw attack.  Sometimes you let go of left/right and press B trying to kick and it does a claw attack instead.  Sometimes you hold right/left and press B and it does a kick instead.  You're essentially at the mercy of whether the game decides to do the attack you wanted or not.\n\nWall jumping is also an issue.  You can double jump from the ground in the game.  You can also attach to walls if you go toward them.  If you jump off a wall, you may jump again midair.  If you fall off a wall, you get a single jump to use midair.   In order to jump off of a wall in the opposite direction (Which you will do constantly in the game), you must press the opposite direction and the jump button at the same time.  This will give you the intial gain in height from the wall jump, plus another jump in midair to get to where you have to go.  The problem is that the game can't tell whether you're jumping off a wall in the opposite direction, or falling off of it.  If you press the opposite direction of a wall, you will fall off of it instantly.  So, if you do not press the opposite direction of the wall and the jump button at the exact same milisecond, the game will interpret it as you wanting to fall off the wall.  This inevitably leads to your death when you're trying to double jump off of a wall to some platform, and you press the jump button but you're now out of jumps, as the game interpreted your jumping off the wall as you deciding to fall off the wall.  There needs to be some sort of delay for falling off the wall... or how about this?  How about simply allowing the player to assign a different button for falling off the wall.  I should be able to hold in the opposite direction to get ready for my jump without the game deciding that it means I want to fall off of the wall to my death.  There are too many deaths caused by this, which again is decided by random chance rather than skill.\n\nLastly, wall attaching.  The game seemingly decides at random whether you want to attach yourself to a wall or not.  Sometimes I'll be right next to a wall wanting to attach to it, and it won't attach.  Other times, I'll jump in the direction of a wall, not touch it, and the game will still decide I touched it and wanted to attach to it.  Other times, I'll fall off a wall trying to fall straight down and the game will re-attach me to the wall, even though I never pressed a button in that direction.  Other times, you'll fall straight down perfectly fine.  Again, this inevitably leads to your death through random chance rather than skill.\n\nA good game ruined by terrible controls, not much more to say about it.","January 22","false","5.8"," 27 of 43 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","27","43","3","0"

Again, this detracts from the precision of the game. For example, you can somehow hurt yourself on upward-facing spikes that are on low ledges next to you, and the arms of the stretching enemies have a slightly larger hitbox than their sprite indicates.\n- Speed isn't rewarded, because any enemy that is capable of flying (wraiths and the floating octopus thingies) will chase you indefinitely until you're inevitably slowed down by an obstacle. They will then swarm you all at once and murder you due to the fact that almost all enemy attacks take priority over your own and there's no grace period in between them. This can be particularly frustrating when you're trying to clear an area that you've been stuck on for a while and have to kill every enemy each time you try.\n- Enemies can ledge guard better than a ♥♥♥♥in' SSBM champ\n- It's seriously repetitive. Aside from the fact that you'll inevitably have to go through some areas over and over until you clear them, there isn't that much variety in the levels themselves. Single button combat means that fighting is tedious and not as rewarding as the pixelated gore might lead you to think.\n- Single button combat also means that it's easy to zig when you should've zagged. The fact that you can only damage enemies while moving is irritating when you're being swarmed in a delicate situation where one misstep can screw you over.\n- You can save anywhere you want except for the areas where you'd want to save the most. Because you're not allowed to form a sigil near obstacles or on moving terrain, all the hard stretches of the game are riddled with arbitrarily placed saws whose only purpose is to say "You wanna save after that really difficult part? ♥♥♥♥ you, go through another."\n\nSome fiendishly difficult games give you satisfaction and pride, but this one just gave me an aneurysm.

Bought this game on a whim a while ago because it looked like a difficult platformer, and I'm crazy, so I love that ♥♥♥♥! Anyway, I spent a little bit of time with it and I hate it. Can't even bring myself to finish it, which is the first time I've ever done that with a Steam game.\n\nThe first problem was that I couldn't even get the game to start. After some fiddling, I found out I had to lower my computer's resolution to 1024x768 just to get the game to work. Trying to change the in-game resolution to 1920x1080 did nothing, as the game suddenly stopped recognizing input from my Xbox controller after I switched it and it asked me to press A before it reverted back to 1024x768. Goodie.\n\nBut technical problems aside, I'll tell you why I really hate the game. It's not the art, the music, or the level design. It's the controls and core gameplay mechanics. If you're going to make a difficult 2D platformer, the first thing you have to do is nail the controls. In this kind of game, if you don't have good controls, you have nothing. I'm going to use Super Meat Boy as an example, because in my opinion that's the most comparable and best indie 2D platformer not called Limbo.\n\nSuper Meat Boy is an example of a 2D platformer done right. Tough as nails, but the difficulty comes from the level design, not the controls. The basic control mechanics are very simple and work well. Meat Boy moves, hold a button and he runs, he jumps, he slides down a wall if he's pressed against it, and he can jump off a wall. Simple. Meat Boy can have extreme lateral jumping movement, but once you get the feel for it, you're in control.\n\nMy entire time playing They Bleed Pixels, I felt like I wasn't in control. You can double jump in this game, starting either from the ground or from a wall. But there were so many times when I would jump off a wall and press A to jump again, only to have my character not jump and fall to her death. This caused me great confusion and I figured out that it was because I pushed the thumbstick away from the wall a split second before I pressed the jump button, causing my character to come off the wall without me noticing before I jumped. Because you can only jump once when you're already in the air, I pressed the jump button, thinking I was jumping off the wall and that I had another one at my disposal, but in actuality, I was using my only in-air jump. Meat Boy only has one jump, which you can only do from a surface. But wall jumping in Meat Boy never causes this problem, because the designer implemented a half a second of delay in pushing the thumbstick away from the wall before Meat Boy actually comes off the wall. It's such a simple tweak, but it makes all the difference in the world, especially when half your game is jumping off walls.\n\nThe other big problem in They Bleed Pixels is that about half of the ground surfaces in the game are "icy", meaning you slide across them. The sheer number of these surfaces in the game is annoying enough; if you want to have a special section or two that has this, no problem, but it's literally throughout every level. To make matters worse, they don't even act like an icy surface in every other platformer ever made. In a normal platformer, you slide across an icy surface at a speed that matches your momentum. Eventually you'll start to slow down. If you try to move in the other direction while sliding, it will take an extra second or two to get your footing. If you maneuver the thumbstick properly, you can slow to a dead stop on the ice. Sound familiar? They Bleed Pixels chooses to handle this mechanic in a completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ way: You can slow down on the ice, but you can never completely stop, meaning if you're on an icy surface, you're always moving, so you have little time to decide where to go to next; if you jump straight up and fall straight down onto an icy surface with no sideways momentum, you will immediately slide at a quick speed in whichever direction you're facing upon landing. Again, these are very simple control issues that needed to be fixed before this game was released.\n\nThe checkpoint system is also ridiculous. You have a checkpoint meter that fills up when you kill enemies or collect orbs, and when it's full, you can lay down a checkpoint wherever you want. And what button do you press to lay your checkpoint? None! That's right, this game automatically does it for you after you stand still for a few seconds. But it won't lay the checkpoint down if there are any enemies or environmental hazards around you. Purple energy grows out of you in a circle to check your surroundings, and if the energy touches anything, it won't lay it down. The problem is there are always enemies and environmental hazards around you, considering the enemies chase you throughout the entire level. So while you're busy fighting enemies and trying to survive, this annoying purple glow keeps pulsing out of you and telling you that you can't use your checkpoint. This do-it-yourself checkpoint system devolves into only being able to lay down the checkpoint in special areas that purposely have no hazards or enemies. So why not have your checkpoint be a flag in one of these areas like every other game?\n\nAnyway, difficulty in a game should come from navigating clever level designs and enemy encounters, not wrestling with the poor gameplay mechanics and systems.\n\ntl;dr This game is almost as bad as Gone Home.","January 9","false","1.2"," 20 of 34 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","20","34","2","0"

Truth.\n\nThey Bleed Pixels is a beautiful game with a fantastic soundtrack in which you kick monsters into pits full of spikes, dodge hurtling squids and collect spherical gobs of pixelated blood. The end result of all the atmosphere and twitch is very good. The only frustrations are in the places where it could've been great. Why did I pass through that wall and fall out of the playable area?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/211260/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","They Bleed Pixels is a 2D Action/Platformer in where we take control of a young orphan girl that finds a mysterious book which slowly begins to transform her into a monster. She is then transported to a world within the book in where there are other monsters all wanting to kill you. Being a monster now, the girl is just as capable of brutally murdering them as they are at harming her. You have a basic attack, a dash attack and a kick that sends enemies flying through the air. You'll rarely just be button mashing as this game is more about using the hazards in the environment to your advantage rather than actual combat with your foes. Killing them in stylish ways will earn you more points which in turn will fill up your checkpoint meter that will allow you to place a checkpoint at a safe place of your choosing by simply standing still for a few seconds when the meter is full.\n\nThe real threat to you will be the environments as this nightmare world is filled to the brim with pointy objects like spike and floating saw blades. Usually you are able to take three hits before death from whatever harms you unless you fall on a spike and are impaled. Saw blades will be your worst foes as their hit-boxes are rather large and being scraped by one will send you bouncing all around the place like if you were a pinball, annoyingly enough. Starting up the game you have the options of picking either Normal or Novice difficulty. Novice difficulty makes the game far easier as well as removes the leader-boards, most of the games collectibles and the final mission of the game won't be accessible in this mode. Normal is far more difficult than it implies and I was happy just being able to get through a level, much less worry about collecting any of the secret pages or other collectibles set in hard to reach locations.\n\nThey Bleed Pixels is an extremely hard game and even if it only continues 11 missions in the story mode it will take you longer than you may expect as you cover the stage in your blood as you die repeatedly. There are no lives or anything of the sort so you are free to try as much as you like and with the addition of being able to set checkpoints wherever you please you'd think it would be a simple task but nothing can be further from the truth. Setting checkpoints requires quite a large area for it to be considered as a safe place to set it, though even immovable saw-blades can deem an area unsafe causing you to pinpoint just the right angle which seems a bit unnecessary. You can exit the game at any time and the next time you choose that level you can load up on the last checkpoint that you set meaning that you can rage quit a level without losing any progress but the leader-boards will be disabled now.\n\nAs you fight and maim your way across the level blood will be spraying everywhere from your defeated foes. The blood in this game is plentiful and will splatter across the environments in a satisfying fashion. Unfortunately the combat system itself is rather abysmal. All the attacks are tied to one button for some reason and accidentally triggering the dash attack was the lead cause of my death throughout. Even then it just doesn't feel right as it is difficult to connect your attacks and when you stay your ground it is impossible to harm them as you default to harmless kicks which can be problematic when there are no hazards to toss them to or when you are fighting a more powerful foe. Other than the basic enemies with stretchable limbs you will also be facing ghosts which can obviously phase through the environments, flying foes that will hurl themselves toward you and a short fella that jumps around with a giant blade. There is a lot of variety within the enemies which is no doubt a good thing but with the combat system in this game it is just a painfully awkward to face them.\n\nIn a game that requires pinpoint precision and has everything placed in a way to kill you stopping to fumble about with an enemy really breaks the flow. After finishing three levels you are rewarded with a cut-scene that reveals more of the story as well as gives you a key in which you can unlock some fan art in the extras menu. The story is there just for the sake of it and doesn't really add or detract from the game. In the extras menu you will find 150 badges that challenge you to do certain things and will take quite a while to complete if you are into that kind of thing, a decent amount of really nice fan art to unlock and five extra levels to play through. These levels are quite different visually from the normal campaign ones and are pretty well done.\n\nMusic is pretty solid across the board though I personally found none of it to be particularly memorable. Graphics are pretty simple with all the environments just being black blocks but having a different background each level so it doesn't get stale. The camera is just right and you never feel cheated due to something you didn't see coming. All in all it is a good game that is sure to challenge even the most hardened of gamers. It will constantly have you wanting to punch something but it is fair enough that it will keep you playing for “one more try”. While the combat part of They Bleed Pixels is sub-par, kicking an enemy into a saw-blade and watching the blood physics work their magic is impressive enough to make it less of a hassle. If you are looking to grow some gray hairs or brag about your gaming skills this would be an excellent title to do so.","March 12","true","5.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Or a great reward at the end. You are going to play this for the feeling of acomplishment after being done with this game. Because honestly- that's the best thing you'll get.\n\n\nLong Version:\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\nF.uck you, Spooky Squid Games. F.uck you for that ending level- I never raged so hard at a game before.\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\nBut god damnit is this a great game.\nThey Bleed Pixels (AKA PIS5! CUN7! B1TCH! AAAAASS!) is a platforming game developed by Spooky Squid Games heavily influenced by lovecraftian horror (please take notice that the reviewer has never read any of H.P. Lovecraft's books) and old hard as balls NES games. To quote a review of Dark Souls: "You will DIE. A LOT."\n\nStory follows a young unnamed girl who I named Lily (why? I don't know honestly, it kind of fits to me), who's dropped at "Lafcadio Academy for Troubled Young Ladies" private school. One day Lily finds a weird book in the library, and begins to read it in the evening. In her following dreams she dreams of being a weird demon hybrid of herself disfiguring other monsters in worlds like out of the head of H.P. Lovecraft. However, in the morning she finds that her dreams are starting to affect her. I won't tell more about the story, but let me tell you, don't expect any MGS or Mass Effect depth of story.\n\nGameplay consists of the dreams Lily finds herself in. While her control scheme might seem really simple at the beginning, you'll find (either to your aproval or disaproval) that the difficulty of the game is not at all in the controls, but in player's SKILL of using them and the ENVIROMENT around you.\nThe levels will start out relatively easy, but will end up being hard as all hell unleashed (especially the last level. OH GOD THAT LAST LEVEL...).\nThe checkpoint mechanic in the game is really neat: your combos and points you gather throughout the levels fill up a special meter at your disposal. When full, you can make your OWN checkpoints anywhere... AS LONG as it is on solid ground, and in a certain distance from enemies or traps.\nOther than that, this game does NOT hold your hand: traps differ from short spikes that take away one of three hit points you have per life, long INSTA-KILL spikes, to buzzsaws that are annoying when there's one but are complete and f.ucking AS.SHOLES in groups.\nEnemies come in four/five types (the game does not give them names so I made up my own [EDIT: THE GAME DOES GIVE THEM NAMES IN THE ACHIEVEMNTS]):\nWalkers: slow guys that attack you with extendable blades and block after you hit them a few times. Around 6-8 HP, not sure.\nSquids: small flying squids that charge you like bullets. Annoying during hard platforming sections. 1 HP.\nGremlins: little guys armed with either swords or bombs. 1 HP\nBomb variant: Suicide bombers. They charge you and try to explode close to you so they can blow you up. Can be useful in fights to kill more enemies at once.\nSword variant: these guys are hard to kill, and are never a good sign, ESPECIALLY in small corridors where you can't jump. Best disposal method is to jump and use the downards attack while they are on the ground. The problem is that they know this attack as WELL, and love to use it. Only positive thing about them is their low HP.\nSamara: oh god no. This ghost with long hair is here to do one thing, and one thing only: RUIN YOUR EFFIN' DAY. She is relentless, can fly through walls, has 7 HP, and teleports if you attack her with more than two times in a row. Method of survival: find a piece of ground without traps, and deal with her on ground. YOU CANNOT KILL HER IN AIR. I TRIED. AND THE DAMN LAST LEVEL OF THE GAME MAKES YOU FIGHT THREE OF THEM IN A ROW, WHILE CLINGING TO A WALL OVER A PIT OF F.UCKING BUZZSAWS AND SPIKES. WITHOUT A CHECKPOINT. GOOD LUCK AS.SHOLE.\nA nice thing is that levels actually resemble their respective background- for example, one level looks like a giant grandfather clock from the inside- huge gears and such. The actual platforms you'll be jumping on will be gears as well. And this counts for all levels. Nice detail.\nThe game offers two difficulties- Novice, which is kind of the same as Normal, but with the exception that you can't access the last level of the game (AND FOR GOOD REASONS), and you only have to finish the level in order to move on.\nNormal difficulty. That's where the shi.ts at. Only here will your progress be tracked, and only here can you get achievents for such things as combos, enemies killed with one attack, etc. Here you can access the last level (which I mentioned a few times already). Here you also get an optional objective: collect the secret Book of Blades pages scattered throughout the level (6/level). At the beggining, like with the levels themselves, they are... well not easy but let's say not as hard as it may seem. But later... The first problem is that sometimes you run through a level, realize you do not have 2-3 pages, and your initial reaction is "WHERE IN THE DAMN HELL COULD THEY BE!?!?". Yes, sometimes, even finding them can be hard. And in the later levels, getting them is not a challenge anymore- it's a damn suicide mission.\n\nI have to mention the last level.\nOH. MY. GOD. If you are not prepared, this level will F.UCKING DESTROY YOUR MIND. It will throw every obstacle you had to endure at you, with a god damn fighting marathon at the end. AND THAT'S NOT EVEN THE HARDEST PART. THE HARDEST PART IS THE ONE WITH THE ELEVATING PLATFORM SHORTLY BEFORE IT- IT MADE ME RAGE SO HARD, I LITTERALLY ALMOST RIPPED MY HAIR OUT IN FRUSTRATION.\n\nBUT GOD DAMN IT IS IT A GREAT GAME.\nThis is one of the games that gives you the determination to go on, to try just one more time, and never give up. The kind of game that makes you celebrate just getting through a tough part. The kind of game that makes you sattisfied with your relentlessness at the end of the level. The moment I finished that god forsaken level was one of the best moments I ever experienced in a game.\n\nThe pixel art and graphics are really great and original, one of the best I've seen in a while.\nThe music is awesome and I'm considering buying the OST, although it's not my type of music.\n\n...Sigh... But do I recommend this game?\nI want to, I REALLY WANT TO... but this is a kind of game that only the hardcore fans of platforming will enjoy. Altough I fell in love with the game, I can't deny my rage that made me ragequit several times before finishing it.\n... But I finished it. Two times in fact.(both difficulties) I can't say that about other games I like more and don't frustrate me as much.\n\n...I RECOMMEND IT.\nUnderstand that you are not going to play this game for a complex story. Or a great reward at the end. Or some epic boss fight at the end (No bosses in this game). YOU are going to play this game, so that when you are done, you can pat yourself on the back and say "I beat They Bleed Pixels.". No great celebration. No big reward. Only you. Your pc. and the glorious feeling of acomplishment after beating that god forsaken final level.\n\nI realise that I haven't said everything about the game (Concept art unlocks, Bonus levels...), but It's currently 2:12 AM in my country, and I just finished the game, and felt the need to write this review.\n\nGreat job Spooky Squid Games. But seriously- F.UCK you for that last level\n\n\nThey Bleed Pixels: 8/10\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, my bed is calling me.

It's a pretty solid platformer and an ok beat 'em up (though sometimes the 1 button fighting gets annoying when you do the wrong moves).\n\nI can't really fault it for being hard, because there were several places on the store page which alluded to its difficulty. I guess I just didn't fully grasp what they meant by RIDICULOUSLY ♥♥♥♥ING HARD, though in retrospect I have no idea how.\n\nMy one compaint is the grading system. The levels are long and arduous ordeals which really beat up inexperienced players like me (sometimes even on novice), and the satisfaction of beating them feels lessened by the C that I get as a grade. The grades are a reflection of your kills, deaths, time taken, and save sigils cast. I, bad player that I am, performed...poorly in most of these categories, so I got low scores. This is obviously because of my lack of skill, but it still just felt insulting to have to face a letter grade reflection of the traumatic experience I just went through (I think I'll pass on Super Meat Boy, thanks).\n\nDespite this, If you're a skilled platformer or are willing to put in the time to become one, then you will like this game.

Movement feels sloppy, for lack of a better term.  On "stable" surfaces, you slide small amounts, but just enough to screw you up.  On deliberately slippery surfaces, (of which there is no shortage) you accelerate extremely rapidly, but slowing down or changing direction is disproportionatly difficult.  Jump controls are adequate.  What really ruins the game, though, is the combat.  The combat controls are unintuitive, and all attacks are needlessly condensed into one button.  You'll find yourself performing dash attacks into spikes when you meant to simply perform a melee attack, because the input for a melee attack is to hold a directional button and tap the attack button, whereas the input for a dash attack is to tap a direction and attack at the same time.  In a game that requires delicate platformining in conjunction with delicate combat, this kind of assignment is just frustrating in a "♥♥♥♥ this, I have better platformers to play" way.  And it's not like there is some kind of technical constraint requiring this; pretty much every PC controller made in the last 10 years has at least 4 face buttons.\nIf the game was purely a platformer, it would have been great.  If they had split up the combat controls, the game could have been great.  If they had just split the levels into clearly defined platforming and combat sections, the game could have been amazing.  Instead, it's disappointingly frustrating because the challenge is in overcoming the horrible way input is handled, rather than challenges presented by the environment.\nThe game is very nice aesthetically.  The music and environments are both very enjoyable.","July 11, 2014","false","1.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I got close to the end and pretty much gave up. After over 400 deaths in the first 5 levels I got a bit tired.\n\nAfter the first two levels or so, you realize that it's pretty much all the same thing repeating itself. They just change the background and add a single new enemy type after every three levels. Don't get me wrong, that's the right amount of added content, but it's to sparcly done. Make it something new every level, not every three.\n\nThe gameplay is very difficult. It involves strategically planning around where you place your own checkpoints, because regardless of where you do, you will be repeating your actions several times. It's just a matter of what you are okay with repeating. The enemies are tough, but fair. It's the traps, maneuvering mechanics, and puzzle solving that gets a bit hectic.\n\nthe unlockable content is not the best, a few pieces of artwork, and some bonus levels, and that's it. I'd recommend adding a few outfits, and possibly a soundtrack or something.\n\nIf you do decide to play this game, don't get angry and toss the controller or it will press pause, up, select restart level, and select.

The difficulty spikes at different areas of a level, making it feel incoherent, and hazards become extremely spammy later on. Rather than designing the level to be interesting, the level just becomes a cluster♥♥♥♥.\n\nOne of the best feature of this game is that you save a checkpoint simply by standing still at an area with no saws/spikes. This is an ingenious idea! However, the level design does not incorporate this mechanic very well. For example, in the end of a level, there is an area entirely filled with saws inside the ground "just" so you can't save. This is bad level design as the rest of the level has nothing like this, and it also throws away the one thing that is unique about this game.\n\nThere are much better precision platformers out there, such as Super Meatboy, Cave Story, and Super House of Dead Ninja.

That being his purpose you can just go into this game with no self exigence at all.\n\nOn the other hand, Super Meat Boy is an exigent game that is fair at the same time (and avoid stress masterfully because you dont lose much when dying).\n\nThis game just tries to seriously defy you but fails to make it a consistent and acceptable journey\n\nThe enemies are somewhat ok; while very interesting and challenging they dont get to the point of being overwhelming. BUT the game gets to the point of being stupid when the mechanics and the level design collide.\n\nYou need to do precise jumps when your every move will be abysmally diffrent on a minimal input diffrence. Not only that, but all the game is full of sliding platforms that apply that to its maximun, to the point of it being almost a gamble when you have to use them. Sincerely, the game would be really better if only one of these issues would have been eased a bit.\n\nOther thing that bothers me to no end is that feature that the game has. Once you get enough points (making them bleed ofc), your character will create a checkpoint when standing still and empty the bar to get another one. Sounds cool right? well, if you are a player like me, its not. Not only the character will try to make a checkpoint every time you stand still, having to hold down to avoid this and making painful to stop for a sec to thing about your next step. Also, if it is your first playthrough you might end up creating checkpoints on very wrong places that could have been not so hard to avoid, and making reach the next safe zone a torture.\n\nBut that's not what i hate the most about that system. What I absolutely dislike the most is that the character will try to create checkpoints even where they cannot be done like sliding platforms, moving ones, or zones full with saws, that are there just for the sake of avoiding you to create one, witch is not bad, but will not stop the character from trying. This makes stoping even for one fraction of a second a very bad idea, since it will affect your movement, and in a game where your movement is already biased, thats bad news\n\nOn other note, the music is great and the art is really good (if you know what to expect of a cute-lovecraftian-pixel style) and i am really sad about not liking the gameplay because it is very evident that a lot of work was put into it to bring it to the point that it is now, but i can not agree with the choices.\n\nPick this one only if you are really interested on really pesky challenges (if you are a mechanical monster i want to see you speedruning this though)\n\nSummary: this is Hardcore, but not sure if the right kind of hardcore.\n\nPS: i will end it, because i am stubborn, but think twice before starting this game.","May 8, 2014","false","5.0"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","2"

The gameplay, although easy to pick up and play, is rather complex due to its scoring and combo system and the level design does offer a lot of challenge.  Despite that however, it can be as difficult as you'd want it to be, as you can make a checkpoint just about anywhere, given you have enough blood to do so, making it a bit more accessible to a broader audience.  As for the art style, even though it uses the overused pixel graphics, it's still pretty and there are unique themes for each and every levels, along with their own musics, erasing some redundancy.\n\nI did like its challenge, but there are some things that are recurrent and that I don't like at all, mostly the blind deaths.  There are times where you'd have to go onto moving platforms, but you wouldn't know when it decides to go into spikes and saws, and there are some blind jumps of faith.  There were also some annoyances with the weird controls, mostly the character's floaty jumps, which might be because I was too scrub, but she's really weird in midair, thus she incessantly bumps into saws, and said saws launch you at random speeds and directions, which pretty much means instant death anyway.\n\nDespite these issues, I'm sure that the aforementioned platformer fans would brush off these issues and still get a load of fun out of it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/griffinsclaw/recommended/211260/","griffinsclaw","Fluffy Tail Toucher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/griffinsclaw/","171 products in account","This is a frustrating platformer.\n\nIt's one of those games in the same realm as super meat boy. And it's fun, but it also has some design choices that seem to be made purely to frustrate.\n\nFirst of all, the game doesn't have instant respawn. And this is a big deal because you die a lot. You only have to wait about a second between deaths, but in that second, you can hammer your a button 5 or 6 times, while you get to look at your dead body and continue being upset that you failed that series of jumps for the 63ed time. For a game like this, you should be able to restart the frame you lose that last heart if you press the button fast enough. It's a choice many successful games in this genre went with, but this game didn't adopt, and it's the poorer for it.\n\nSecondly, this game has almost no invulnerable frames between taking damage. They are there, but for almost all your deaths, you might as well only have one heart since you'll just become stunlocked by something, thrown into other hazards and instantly dead from a single mistake. This is componded by the fact that the main difficulty is the platforming, not the combat per se. Your deaths will be because you held the stick a tenth of a second too long and missed the jump or hit a spike. Since you have almost no invuln frames, you can fall in a pit a foot deep, be hit by the spikes, then be hit by the same spike two more times in quick succession rather than being able to just take your heart of damage and jump out. It would honestly be better if most of the hazards were simply instant death traps. As it is, usually your deaths are just extra drawn out shows of being ripped apart after you get your arm caught in the wheat thresher, and while the spectacle and blood splatter is fun, it just adds to the frustration of dying after a short time.\n\nLastly, I think the combat could by vastly better by making kick and slash use different keys, rather than having combat be one button that changes behaviour based on how long it's pressed and what direction you're pushing the movement stick. I understand that the appeal of the game is in needing to execute the controls perfectly, but for a casual like me the reality is that I'm kicking when I want to jab, and dashing off a ledge when I just wanted to make a quick punch. The control difficulty doesn't add much to the game, and it adds to the frustration factor when when you die because your character is making an action you didn't intend.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that the game is fun, but you need patience. It's challenge that's designed to punish, rather than hold your hand and tell you to give it another go.\n\nOf course I just bought it for cutie pie monster girl protagonist. Money well spent.","June 5, 2015","true","8.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Individual levels are lengthy and well-designed, with a unique checkpoint system helping lessen some of the frustration of dying in tough spots. There's also a somewhat clunky combat system that comes across as a bit obtuse early on but gets better with use. Controls are mostly tight and responsive as they should be in this type of game, however at times it feels as though there's a slight yet noticeable input delay when it comes to jumping. It's something I eventually adapted to and didn't notice at all after playing for a long stretch, but it was a nuisance early on. The game also features a quirky gothic aesthetic style and Lovecraft-influenced story, as well as a surprisingly fantastic soundtrack.\n\nIf you aren't a fan of difficult 2D platformers that are capable of pushing your patience, it's probably best to pass on They Bleed Pixels.

It's a good game, but it has some hangups. First, the jump control is not especially tight, and controlling your character on ice is unlike other games and uneccessarily frustrating. Additionally, the attack controls are unintuitive, as you have to hold towards your enemy to do damaging attacks which frequently dashes you into bad situations. While the two-button scheme would be effective, there are exactly one too many moves. It would do a lot better with a third button to access the kicks and allowing normal slashes on neutral. The hitbox on the basic slash is also very small.\n\nWhile you get 3 hits before dying, the game often puts you in one-hit death situations where the life bar is irrelevant. It does this far too often. It also cheats with the checkpoint system; you are often unable to use a checkpoint even if you have one, simply because there is no solid ground or the solid ground is deliberately surrounded by buzzsaws that block your checkpoint activation.\n\nWhile the gameplay is fun and a lot of the level design is very enjoyable, the game feels like it was made in the 1980s and has lots of irritating "pixel perfect" maneuvers. Also due to the limited use of the checkpoint system, it has long stretches where you cannot use a checkpoint and must run through lengthy gauntlets of obstacles.\n\nIf you think fondly on eagles knocking you into pits in the original Ninja Gaiden, then this game will entertain. Most gamers will find this game frustratingly difficult. I enjoy it, but the difficulty tuning is not perfect and many levels have outright annoying elements that are hard even when you know how to beat them.","October 29, 2013","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While this game is well made, a good port on PC, and has controller support, I will say its definitely not for everyone, because of one factor.\n\nThe Difficulty\n\nThis is one of the most difficult platformers I've ever played, and it isn't for reasons you'd expect. For one unlike other notoriously hard platformers, you are given a wide variety of abilities, such as a dash, double jump, wall jump, and a plenty of combat moves to work with against enemies. You also get a system that replaces lives and continues with your own checkpoint at any point of the level when a certain score is reached by defeating enemies and collecting items. However, the levels don't get truly challenging until you hit the 3rd world, which is referred to as dreams in this game.\n\n"THEN HOW COULD THIS GAME POSSIBLY BE HARD!?" You scream at me\n\nWell the enemies are designed to be aggressive, all of them, even tiny squids are your worst enemy as the level design shows you more saws in one area then at your local hardware store. Because there is a heavy hitting knock-back similar to that of the Castlevania games on NES, you'll more likely die from hitting one cleverly placed saw or enemy, because there is no recovery time in the game you could lose all 3 of your hearts in less than a second.\n\nAll in all, this was a great game to play, and an amazingly designed one at that with a cool style and music, I'd recommend it, but to actually finish it is a question you can only answer by your skill level.\n\nAlso you play as a little girl, so that's cool.","August 11, 2014","true","12.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They're simple and intuitive - an asset somewhat spoiled by the inclusion of a pointless tutorial system followed by on-screen directions at the beginning of the first level. However, don't fear this game staying too easy for long, it gets crushingly difficult - to the point of spending tens of minutes at each obstacle.\n\nThe tight controls are complimented by amazing visual and sound direction, which make the whole experience just plain satisfying to play. Checkpoints are left by standing still when you've collected enough blood from enemies & orbs (this game's 'coin') and respawning is near instantaneous - culminating in a fluent, frustrating and fabulously eldritch experience.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a challenge of skill, and the good type of trial and error - in which each attempt brings you ever so closer to victory. I also recommend that, if you can, play this with a buddy and a controller, trading off when one player gets too frustrated - the competitivity and camaraderie, as well as the opportunity to take rests, will make for a more enjoyable overall experience.","September 3, 2013","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game blends challenge with fun in one of the best ways I've seen in a while. This is meant to be a rage game, but it always seems to get you just angry enough that you want to keep going, just to feel the satisfaction of beating a level. The control scheme is a bit awkward, and it could take a couple levels to get mostly used to. There ARE times that this game makes you want to punch a small child, but hey...it's a rage game. What do you expect? You're gonna get worked up a few times, definitely. However, most of the time, this game isn't TOO bad if you just keep trying. It's not like IWBTG as well, in the sense that it won't take you 100 attempts to get past a single section/screen. For TBP, give it around 10 tries. It's also not like IWBTG, where most obstacles come out of nowhere and are completely unpredictable at first. At most points it's difficult, but never unforgiving. In terms of platforming, the jumps are all made to be slightly tricky to quite tricky. It does a good job of blending platforming and beat-em-up. It seems that you, at almost any point in the game, are either making tricky jumps or fighting groups of enemies. There is rarely a point where you're only doing one of those for a prolonged amount of time. In all, it's a tricky but well-balanced platformer that isn't afraid to be tough, but tries its best to not bring you to the brink of ragequit. Most of the time that you get mad while playing this will not be because of the game, but because of your own mistakes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049470229/recommended/211260/","76561198049470229","CHAOS_FANTAZY","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049470229/","40 products in account","The indie market is simultaneously one of the best and the worst ideas in the gaming industry, and both for the same reason:  there are so many games.  On one hand, some of them must be good; on the other, how do you find them?  Gifted to me by my brother nearly two years ago, I find that They Bleed Pixels is a true hidden gem amongst the sands of the indie market.\n\nFirst, but not foremost, the aesthetics.  As implied by its somewhat curious title, They Bleed Pixels puts itself in the vein of "new-age retro" with old-school graphics and gameplay.  Even though the game uses a modern graphics engine (Resulting in some slowdown for those playing games on a toaster like me), graphics are in the dead-simple style of something you may perhaps find on a SNES.  The game makes the interesting stylistic choices of outlining almost everything in white instead of black, and making all the platforms dead-simple in nature, likely to make the player character stand out more—and, boy, does she.  Animation for They Bleed Pixels is incredibly fluid; the amount of work put into the protagonist alone is insane (No frame count available since the sprites haven't been ripped yet, but it's definitely up there), but the enemies, too?  Factor in the lush pixel art for the comic-book-styled cutscenes, and the hugely detailed backgrounds in every stage, and it becomes evident that Spooky Squid really sweated the small stuff.\nThe soundtrack of the game was performed by a "DJ Finish Him," a music artist I hadn't heard of until now.  Specializing in unorthodoxy, his style relies heavily on using things never intended to be instruments as instruments.  As such, the music, while not unpleasant, has a tendency to fade into the background and go unnoticed by the player, nothing at all like the earworms from the old days of video gaming.  It did help set the atmosphere with its low, droning tunes, but I find it somewhat unfitting for a game falling into the "new-age retro" category.\n\nAlright, on to the gameplay.  It is very easy to say things like "They Bleed Pixels is the Gothic Lolita lovechild of Super Meat Boy," but I find it better to view it as its own thing.  Self-classed as a "Lovecraftian Platformer," They Bleed Pixels combines difficult platforming alongside with deadly combat, all at a breakneck pace (Or it would be, were it not for my slowdown).  Gameplay is primarily based upon killing enemies in the most brutal ways possible, earning more points as you stab your foes to death in more ways.  Players who keep their claws soaked will find themselves rewarded with combo bonuses—and, with a ranking system and high-score table, there's definitely some incentive for the player to kill with skill instead of fighting to stay alive.  Speaking of staying alive, our poor heroine has only three hearts to her name, and there are a handful of things in the game capable of killing her instantly, so—simply as a fact of the way the game is designed—be prepared to die a couple times.  And start working on becoming emotionally immune to those heart-rending screams she gives every time she dies.  Luckily for the player, however, there is also a game mechanic that allows the player to charge up a checkpoint as they kill things and rack up points, and when fully charged, the player can stand still for a moment to drop a checkpoint anywhere they wish (Provided that something that could kill them isn't too close).\nNaturally, the game has a steep learning curve; after a tutorial and a tutorial level, the player is thrown headlong into difficult challenges.  Unlike Super Meat Boy, however, the game never feels unreasonable, or like its only objective is to kill you.  Unfortunately, however, the combat begins to drop off towards the end of the game while platforming moves to center stage; with only five enemy types and no bosses, the player learns how to kill very quickly, and then maneuvering through the level becomes the main problem.  Even with this, though, the game remains tantalizingly fun and satisfying.\n\nThe plotline of the game, too, is compelling, and perhaps part of the driving force that keeps the player wanting to play.  An unnamed girl (Let's call her Claudia) looking to be about ten years of age is dropped off at Lafcadio Academy for Troubled Young Ladies, a boarding school that feels eerie and uninviting on its own without any supernatural forces.  In the library, she stumbles upon a bloody tome, and—out of curiosity, I suppose—she opens it, and in an instant its magic is upon her, turning her into a demonic claw-handed form of herself and transporting her to a curious dreamscape, in which she rampages about, slaughtering the denizens.  Whenever she wakes up from one of these curious dreams, she finds herself becoming more like the monster she dreamed she was...\nThe story is told through a series of nonobtrusive, skippable cutscenes between the levels of the game.  Not a word is spoken throughout the entire length of the story, and much of the game is left to the interpretation of the player; yet it seems to have some depth to it, with its dark, Lovecraftian theme.  I would say that They Bleed Pixels's story is one of its strongest suits.\n\nOverall, They Bleed Pixels was not exactly a standard game by any measure.  It threw out conventions in just about every department, including that of the storyline department, and replaced them with things of its own invention.  Being unafraid to try something new is admirable in itself, but I would say that the experiment of They Bleed Pixels was a success as well.  There were no bosses, but the gameplay was fun anyway; the music faded into the background, but it still helped set the mood; the game had slowdown on my computer, but it did nothing to damper my experience.  I give They Bleed Pixels Nine Bloody Corpses out of Ten.  Claudia has charmed me, and I hope I get to see her again someday.\n\nThey Bleed Pixels is a meager $10 on the Steam market—a fair price for its content (11 levels and 3 free DLC levels) already, in my opinion, but it goes on sale at times for even cheaper.  I would definitely recommend They Bleed Pixels if it's in your budget.","February 4, 2014","true","13.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Someone evidently greased every level in vaseline because youll be sliding around uncontrollably and straight into yet another spike pit. I cant tell you if the game is more playable with a 360 controller seeing as i dont own one, but clearly the keyboard controls were a total afterthought. To make any kind of progress you need to use the right moves to build a combo which gives you a checkpoint.

As the name implies, it is done in a beautiful pixel art style, and oh yes they do bleed. A lot. Your character is a girl who is sent to a boarding school and becomes cursed by a strange book, and every night she turns into a monster with purple skin and claws for hands, and goes out to fight monsters, only to wake the next morning covered in blood. It's a dark story, and although I haven't beaten the entire game yet, I can safely say that in all the levels I've played there really isn't much of a story beyond what I just said. The cutscenes between levels are all pretty much the same, with the girl waking up and discovering the cursed book lying on the table next to her bed, then trying to dispose of it, only for it to come back to her that night and transform her into the monster again.\n\nThe gameplay is superb. The platforming works well on a keyboard, but is even better with a controller, and the game has a popup at the beginning that suggests using a controller to play. On the hardest difficulty setting, it requires pixel-perfect accuracy and timing in order to survive the various traps laid out across the levels, while the easier difficulty setting has less traps to allow a bit more freedom. Both are insanely hard, so if you're wanting a game that has an "easy" setting you should look elsewhere. One feature that I really like is that you have to earn checkpoints by collecting red orbs (I assume blood?) throughout the levels, and it autosaves when you stop moving. This means that if you want to wait to save until you get past a certain trap, you can just keep moving and hold onto that checkpoint until you get to where you want to be, then just stand still for a few seconds to save.\n\nVisually, They Bleed Pixels is a work of art. The pixel art style works very well for this game, and the music also gives it a very dark and gruesome atmosphere. The character's motion feels very fluid, and it's quite a stylish game all things considered.\n\nThe only area I found underwhelming was the story. As I mentioned before, there is (so far) very little progression as the character keeps falling prey to the curse and trying to rid herself of the book, only to wake up covered in blood with the book on her night stand again the next morning. This would be more annoying if the game didn't have such great gameplay, but as it is, I can forgive a mediocre story since it's really just about the platforming. And the blood. SO MUCH BLOOD!!! MUAHAHAHA!!!!\n\nRating:\nGameplay: 5/5\nVisuals: 5/5\nAudio: 5/5\nStory: 2/5\n\nTotal: 17/20  =  85% positive rating.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

The first level or two are really fun, however, this is one of the most tremendously frustrating games I have ever played.\n\nSuper Meat Boy is famous for possessing incredibly accurate controls. In practice, this means that when you die, you died becasue you screwed up, not the game. That is not the case with They Bleed Pixels. As if the controls being finicky would not be enough, one of the built in game mechanics is ice. This means that even if the controls where bearable, the environment that your character is in is unbearably aggravating.\n\nI purchased this game when it was on sale so one could argue the amount I payed was worth the fun of the frist few levels. But the frustration caused by the latter levels eliminates any good will I might have had for the game.\n\nBuy at your own risk.","November 30, 2013","false","1.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_ferro/recommended/211260/","_ferro","ferro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_ferro/","194 products in account","Initially I really enjoyed this game. The aesthetic and the promise of a slower paced Super Meat Boy platformer with some combat mixed in was the main pull for me.\n\nWhen I started playing the game I had some trouble with the controls, it felt very fumbly and the amount of actions expected out of a single button seemed a bit much. I figured, hey I'm bad at platformers generally speaking so I'll just have to take some time to improve. While I did improve, the problems with the controls did not.\n\nAs the difficulty of the levels increased I discovered that my initial concerns may not have just been my own incompetence. The controls are too sensitive in some places, not sensitive enough in others. The attack animations are very awkwardly timed (the overhead slash, in particular), and too much is expected out of the "attack" button. To lay out what all the buttons are in this game (using an X360 pad), it's Left Stick to move, A to jump, and B to attack. But What attack you do depends on context or how the button is pressed. Left Stick + B = standard stabbing attack, Left Stick + B = dashing attack as well, if there is nothing immediately close to you. Just tapping B makes you kick, holding B makes you kick straight up. Left Stick (up) + B = overhead slash, while in the air B = ground slash, unless you're next to an enemy, then B = attack enemy.\n\nToo much expected of too little, and combined with the less-than-impressive responsiveness of the controls this creates more frustration than is bearable. There were times during wall-jumping sections that require a double jump, but falling from the wall is considered a jump, and even thinking about moving the Left Stick away from the wall causes you to fall. This created no end of terrible moments of being unable to control the character well enough to accuratly move around the obstacles.\n\nSome might say I am bad at platformers, but I have played more difficult levels than what They Bleed Pixels has to offer in games like Super Meat Boy and 1001 Spikes, and succeeded without much, or any, frustration. I could not finish They Bleed Pixels because of the control issues, but combined with the lack of resolution options or really any basic graphics settings, I would not recommend anyone play this game.","September 1, 2014","false","6.3"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

The first thread about graphics card error was written by the developer on 8/11/2012 and still has not been fixed. I just bougth a game I can't play on my laptop even meeting the minimun system requirements. I never expected this from a pixel game. Apparently " it's about the resolution of the texture packs".\n\nAmazing. I'm very dissapointed right now.\n\nEDIT: What kind of seriousness can you expect from developers that have to rewrite their entire game to fix critical errors that shouldn't be there in the first place? Sure they want to expand to Linux, but I guess they also want to "expand" to Intel Graphics Card's users who purchased the game without knowing they wouldn't be able to play it.\n\nEven more, since the beginning of the rewrite they have released more than 20 achievements which are unobtainable until the soon release of the final product. That wouldn't be bad if the game wouldn't be being released "soon" for four months and counting.\n\nPlus, don't be fooled. The vast majority of people giving positive reviews haven't played for more than 2 hours. They don't even know the second screen is entirely made of ice. YES, THE SECOND ONE.\n\nBecause in this game hard does not equal intelligent. Hardness here is ice in inconvenient places and adding a bunch more of saws and spikes to too easy areas.

There is no difficulty curve whatsoever- after the third stage the game rapidly increases challenge to rediculous levels, and requires far more patience and effort than can be balanced by the meagre early game exposition in the way of motivation.\n\nOr, to put it simply, it offers too little and demands too much.","November 4, 2014","false","1.2"," 20 of 39 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","20","39","0","0"

The foreground platforms are a uniform black with ice or spikes on them, but the backgrounds give each level and stage a distinct personality and some real charm to the game.\n\nThe sound for this game is unmemorable, for me atleast.

Button responses are quick and precise, moving is (mostly) intuitive and the kicking mechanic works like a charm. They have to be, considering the overwhelming difficulty of the game. The beautiful, maddening difficulty...\n\nThe art style is, obviously, pixel'ed and bloody, but the blood effects aren't obtrusive aside from when you kill and enemy. The foreground platforms are a uniform black with ice or spikes on them, but the backgrounds give each level and stage a distinct personality and some real charm to the game.\n\nThe sound for this game is unmemorable, for me atleast. The sound of the saw-blades buzzing or the Boo-ettes chasing you down are my most memorable sound effects in the game.\n\nI personally loved this game. The insane difficulty, the gorgeous backgrounds, the silent yet descriptive cut-scenes. The whole game was completly brilliant. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys hardcore platforming and sutble references to classic horror fiction. If you are more of a casual gamer, however, this is not the game for you. You will need to invest a lot of time and many deaths to master this particular platformer.\n\n\nA little selfish self-promotion now. I have done a blind Let's Play of this game.

One that is very difficult by the end.  Unlike many platformers, combat is integral to this game, and while the one button system is simple compared to a Metroidvania or action game it is intuitive and enjoyable.  The game has a good blend of combat and platforming.  Enemies are sometimes used as obstacles more than opponents, acting as a barrier that you must bypass to escape an oncoming wall of death, other times they might be stress toys more than anything else (kicking a shambler into a sawblade is VERY satisfying).  The scenery, music, and atmosphere are all extremely good.  The stages are dark and spooky, and each has its own architectural theme, making them visually distinct.\n\nThis is a great game available at a great price.

I hate going against the popular vote, especially when a game has 90% positive reviews out over over 1,000 reviews like this one does, but I am staying with my initial, unflinching diagnosis of this game. It is unfortunate and I feel stupid going against so many positive reviews, but user reviews on Steam do not always signify a good game. See: DayZ. If not for the two problems that cripple this game, it would otherwise be a masterpiece. I recently reviewed Teleglitch and said it was by far one of the hardest games ever made. It is infinitely easier than this game. This game is the hardest game in the history of gaming, in my opinion, and for all of the wrong reasons. Without trying to be cute or funny I can say that fighting Mike Tyson in Punchout wearing a blindfold would be easier. I have played some legendarily hard games and beaten them, some with not as much effort as most people say they needed to beat them, but this game I just couldn't do anything because the controls are in my opinion so poorly done. Of course 90% of other reviews here disagree with me, so catch this game on sale and decide for yourself.\n\nThe first are the horribly over-responsive and loose controls. You fly around like a pinball in a pinball machine in levels designed with every pitfall and hazard imaginable covering about 99% of each level. Over responsive in that in air after a jump is way too responsive. If I press right or left, I go way too far in that direction. Loose in that when you stop running, your character does not stop or even slow down quickly, she keeps sliding a bit. These things are the very single reason I ever died in the game. I never, not even for a second, felt challenged as a gamer because i just could not do anything with the horribly loose controls. The other issue with the game are the fighting controls. I struggled to remember exactly what to do on each zombie fight even though it is so simple. Simple yet so unnecessarily contrived. Even on the third level when I was getting it down, it still felt incredibly awkward. And that is where I gave up in utter disgust at the controls, level 3. Level 1 told me on the end screen I had died 30+ times. Level 2 I died 40+ times. Level 3 it was endless deaths and that was because, in addition to the hyper/loose controls, they put ice on every floor and platform in the level. I tried dozens and dozens of times from each checkpoint, slipping, sliding, bouncing, and being knocked into spikes, more spikes, buzz saws, and more spikes. And that leads me to the second game killer.\n\nThe second thing in the game I could not do anything to guard against or improve: knock back. When you get hit, you bounce way away from your point of contact. You very, very seldom get lucky and get bounced to safely land. Nearly every single time you ever get hit, you are bounced right into another hit or into death. Enemies knock you into other enemies and death pits. Non-lethal spikes knock you into other enemies and death pits. And one of the worst enemies I have ever seen in a game, the flying creatures in this game are unbearable.\n\nSo to cut it short, I can say that since you are a pinball in this game, this should have just been a table add-on for Pinball FX.","October 31, 2014","false","1.6"," 23 of 47 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","23","47","0","0"

But this game reach hardness with its' bad controls scheme and time by time ridiculously uncontrollable protagonist little girl.\n\nControls are both sloppy and illogical. A lot of buttons are there but they limited you only one attack button. For example, you have to kick someone to without touching dpad/arrow keys and hit the attack button. It's OK to "simplify the controls" (on the paper) but in that kind of game, it's frustrating and bad. It leads player to use kick when they don't want to (or opposite, it leads player to use slash). Why they didn't assign an extra key for kick? i.e. X button for X360 controllers? Or RB/LB maybe? Or any other one key of tens of keys on our lovely keyboards?\n\nBecause of that bad controls scheme, i just lost the little cute girl on the sawblades, spikes or in some specific battle conditions which those losses wouldn't even had to be happen.\n\nAlso hit detection a little bit off.\n\nI don't know. If you still want to buy, give it a try. It's a good game but controls are frustrating enough.\n\nPros:+ Good 16-bit era graphics\n+ Particle and gib effects\n+ Combos\n+ Interesting story\n+ Level designs\n+ Music distortion effect when you die\n\nCons:- Repetitive and mediocre, forgettable background music\n- Extremely frustrating controls (which makes the game nearly unplayable)\n- There are some problems about hit detection\n- Jumping angle a little bit silly\n- Blowback while hit time by time a little bit exaggerated","March 31, 2015","false","6.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

It game looks good, I like the graphics the cut scenes look very good, the levels are well designed, the story is very good and interesting, I like the checkpoint system but I just can’t get past it’s problems.\n\nThe main problem is the controls, the came controls similar to Super Meat boy but with slower movement. The problem with that is the controls and level design of Super Meat Boy work well together the level design in this is larger and more expansive than Super Meat Boy. Super Meat Boy is about speed, you supposed to get through the level as fast (I think Super Meat Boy is teh type of game Sonic the Hedgehog should have evolved into) as you can and too much precision could slow you down, but a lot of the platforming in this requires more precision than Super Meat Boy. The larger, more expansive levels of this game requires greater precision in its controls, this makes the game very frustrating in a bad way.\nThere is a lot of places that uses ice physics (it’s not ice, I think it’s slime or something), I get the point of it, it’s to prevent you from generating a checkpoint in that aria but I absolutely hate ice physics, I hated ice physics in the Mario games and I hate ice physics in this. The ice physics in this is particularly bad, you can not stand still in a spot with ice physics (you need to stand still to generate a check point which, again, is the point). I understand why it’s there but it’s still frustrating in a bad way.\nThe combat in this game could be good, sometimes it’s good when there is no ice physics involved, there isn’t an advancing wall of doom and when your not on a small platform but when your in those situations the problems with the combat become very apparent and frustrating in a bad way. There is only one attack button, press it and the player character kicks, hold it down then let go and she kicks the enemy harder and straight up (which is fun when there is spikes or a saw above), press forward and attack and she will stab and forward and attack is also a dash attack. This game was originally released on XBLA, the Xbox controller has four buttons on its face, four buttons and the game uses two. It could use three attack buttons, stab, kick, and high kick and have forward and stab for a dash attack. When your on some slime, your on a small platform or there is an advancing wall of circler saw doom and an enemy is in front of you the combat controls are frustrating in the bad way.","January 2, 2014","false","5.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Do you have a pixellated taste for the semi-cute and the somewhat-gothic? Does tossing eldritch... things into spikes sound like endless fun to you?\n\nLook no further.\n\nDo feel that designers should stick with the well-honed standards for their combat and movement controls? Do you like your gameplay in short, easily-digestable chunks? Do you crave a lush and meaningful setting, full of rich characters?\n\nMight want to put your time and effort somewhere else.\n\nThey Bleed Pixels is a hard game to fall in love with, but once it whispers its nightmares into your ears long enough to poison your mind to its world-view, you may find it difficult to put down. There are many comparisions to be made here to Super Meat Boy, but in the end they are superficial. While we are, perhaps, talking about similar genres, TBP is a combat platformer, and the fighting is what makes all the difference here.\n\nWarning: you might hate it. One-button combat isn't for everyone, and it can be frustrating to learn. But it's not the fighting itself that is the brilliant part of this game. It is how the combat is integrated into the level design / savepoint / score system. Fighting is not necessarily hard - but fighting in a way that maximizes your results is. Pulling off a long combo in this game has a satisfaction to it that you won't find in many other experiences.\n\nIn the end, it's a spike-pit-jumper and a demon-juggler, and that's an alley that I am delighted to spend my time exploring.

It's got a good atmosphere and concept, the level design is great, the controls are great (once you get used to them that is), the music is fitting, and it's super challenging. After going through Super Meat Boy, I craved action platformers, and I certainly got what I was looking for.\n\nIf you've beaten Super Meat Boy, consider that training camp. This game is HARD and it doesn't pull the punches. It really crosses the line sometimes and makes you think "Was that death really my fault? Or did the game screw me over with some bad pattern timing / RNG knockback / just a random finnicky input?" You need to understand going in that the controls are going to feel very strange until you get used to them and you will need to relearn your normal platformer muscle memory. There were moments I spent 5+ hours on one segment for a couple acheivements because of the absolute platforming perfection necessary. When you're trying to flawless a level and enemies are moving in sometimes random directions or you're a frame off on your jump, it gets seriously frustrating.\n\nHowever, the payoff for going through the frustration is seriously worth it. It's a double sense of accomplishment really; once from beating the game and once from mastering your playstyle and zipping through the stages without touching an enemy. Just be warned that getting over that plateu is utter hell.","February 11","true","43.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The unpredictability of controls (especially on those slippery surfaces) makes it harder and frustrating. In many places the game only shows you a very small part of the level that is coming next which basically boils down taking a leap of faith and hope that you land on the safe platform. Most of it is trial an error and you end up dying a lot. The next time you try you have to memorize as where you can go and where you cannot go. So it becomes a memory game for a while and instead of enjoying the game you fight with the game.\n\nI would love to finish it but I think I am done playing this game!","November 10, 2014","false","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A little story takes place. The soundtrack are kind of good (but I don't like the attenuation effect when you die). Simple controls (2 buttons and 1 stick). Some references to H.P. Lovecraft.\n\nBut beware, this game is "easy to play, hard to master" (Fans of meatboy will be pleased)\nNothing to say about the checkpoint system. Just be careful where you put them. (sometime you put them in a hurry way too far from a dangerous zone, can be stressful when you die and you have to go all the way another time)\nThe first levels are a little hard if you take them head-on but with a little perseverance you can pass them.\nthe real problem is that your character is (too) fast (horizontally and vertically) and sometime you have to go to the pixel through walls of sawblades (while another follows you).\n\nPlay at your risks.

It will not allow you stop at all.\nand the main problem with it is when you do a small jump it will make you fly in that direction. which was a game breaker for me. The fact the game teaches you to kick punch, and slide dash means that it should work all the way through in this game right? Well this white goo makes it so you cant dash and you have to stop controlling your direction to kick so your left with punch most of the way. The game was fine in the beginning, but it decides to break its own rules and change it from a hard but fair game to a game you can barely control. In the end this game takes more stuff from games like "I want to be the guy" then fair platformers. If your looking for a super meat boy alike game you have not found it.","July 1, 2014","false","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Expect a whole lot of spikes, deathtraps, difficult jumps and enemies set in weird places. Many times this game will force you to rush, perform some sick combo, but without telling you directly - it's not exactly your "press JUMP to jump" game. It's kinda frustrating at times, but it's equally exciting and satisfying.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple - go on, defeat enemies (or don't), reach the objective. It's got a checkpoint system (no quick save/load), but it's kinda different compared to other arcade/platformer games - you get points by collecting them or by killing enemies (bigger combo - more points), it fills up your meter and when it's full you can set a checkpoint. The environment is pretty hazardous, not only for you, but also for the enemies, as you can kick people sending them into the air.\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing as well and for a chiptune (it's pretty close to that) fan it's a feast, also giving the game a lot of momentum.","July 21, 2014","true","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The controls are fantastic and responsive, which is important because it can be a difficult but never unfair game. You can do some surprisingly cool stuff with the 1 button combat which is nicely flushed out with a mass number of environmental hazards you can send baddies into.\n\nThe Lovecraft vibe and graphics go well. Everything is very clear and it doesn't feel like they went with old school graphics for the sake of cutting corners. Pixel art is nicely animated. I got a bit of a nostalgic feeling, but your character can just do so much more than old 8 bit games.\n\nEverything in the game feels very intuitive, and just exactly what I want from a platformer. The checkpoint system in which you make your own, is a really cool touch, and keeps the game fun and not frusterating despite it's challenge level. When you do get frustrated, just kick a couple monsters into buzz saws and you'll feel much better.\n\nLast but not least, the soundtrack is awesome.","May 23, 2014","true","405.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

One of those games that has me bending my controller after dying for the umpteenth time on a segment, but leaves me not wanting to give up --- nothing unfair, just requires plenty of skill. Personally I think the controls are little TOO simplified as far as combat goes (having the kick and stab moves on separate buttons would really help things feel less awkward), but as far as plaforming goes they're pretty tight and give the kind of precision you need in this game.\n\nSo yeah, I'd say the relationship between the player and the game is plenty balanced: you repeatedly stab and kick enemies into death spikes and buzzsaws, and the game in turn gets to bash your face in with tricky platforming.

It features fast-paced skill-oriented combat and movement, beautiful pixel style cutscenes and in-game graphics, and an intriguingly dark storyline.\n\nPROS:\n-Combat feels fluid, well-paced and simple, yet complex enough to keep things interesting\n-Graphics are carefully and thoughtfully designed. Beautiful scenery coupled with excellent level design makes for a great combination\n-This game is difficult, and thats a good thing. It is horror themed after all\n-The soundtrack is uniquely dark and upbeat. Balances well with the gameplay\n-The storyline is a step above general "save-the-princess" platformers, so thats a plus\n-Ingenious check-point system that puts control in the hands of the player and allows for awesome speedrun opportunities\n-Well-crafted characters/enemies that stand out\n-Good variety and complexity in puzzles and challenges\n\nCONS:\n-Personal gripe: Menus felt a bit cluttered and unweildy, but maybe thats just me\n-Difficulty fits well in both categories I believe, some may find it off-putting\n-Enemy variety can become a bit tiresome by the end\n\nOverall "They Bleed Pixels" offers a uniquely addictive horror/platformer experience in a delightfully dark package complete with stunning visuals and a remarkably fresh style of gameplay. While there are areas to be polished (as with any game) and the difficulty of the gameplay may be too much for some, those who stick through to the end are guaranteed a rewarding experience.","June 30, 2014","true","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is my favourite indie retro platformer and I have played Fez, SMB, Braid and lots more. TBP gets everything right and should be considered a classic among the great retro platformers.\n\nTight controls, great level design, surprisingly sophisticated combo system with juggles and the ability to incorporate the many environmental hazards into them. It's endless fun finding new and creative ways of juggling the bad guys onto some spikes or saw blades. The design is also very solid with one of the most effective uses of pixel art I have seen to date and great sound effects, the animation reminds me of Lemmings in that it has the maximum fluidity with the minimum amount of pixels.\n\nI haven't had this much fun playing a single player game in a while. Highly recommended if you like challenging platform games and especially if you also play fighters.\n\nNote: At the moment there are no resolution options, however they are working on a full re-write that adds this and improves many other technical aspects which is near completion.","June 26, 2014","true","5.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I, however, found this game to be rather challenging. Controls are smooth (using the keyboard) and only at the times of great frustration did i (unfairly) blame the game for my successive deaths. The leveldesign is generally good, usually each level will contain one or two segments that are really, really hard and unforgiving. The checkpoint-spawning mechanic is nice, it forces you to be creative with your kills. The strange thing about it however is that if you are good at the game, it will charge faster, thus granting security to those who actually dont need it that much. Combat is basic, but tossing enemies into buzzsaws is quite satisfying.\nCompleting a level, even with horrid stats, feels like a real achievement, therefore i recommend this title.\n","July 1, 2014","true","8.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It will not allow you stop at all.\nand the main problem with it is when you do a small jump it will make you fly in that direction. which was a game breaker for me. The fact the game teaches you to kick punch, and slide dash means that it should work all the way through in this game right? Well this white goo makes it so you cant dash and you have to stop controlling your direction to kick so your left with punch most of the way. The game was fine in the beginning, but it decides to break its own rules and change it from a hard but fair game to a game you can barely control. In the end this game takes more stuff from games like "I want to be the guy" then fair platformers.

Expect a whole lot of spikes, deathtraps, difficult jumps and enemies set in weird places. Many times this game will force you to rush, perform some sick combo, but without telling you directly - it's not exactly your "press JUMP to jump" game. It's kinda frustrating at times, but it's equally exciting and satisfying.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple - go on, defeat enemies (or don't), reach the objective. It's got a checkpoint system (no quick save/load), but it's kinda different compared to other arcade/platformer games - you get points by collecting them or by killing enemies (bigger combo - more points), it fills up your meter and when it's full you can set a checkpoint. The environment is pretty hazardous, not only for you, but also for the enemies, as you can kick people sending them into the air.\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing as well and for a chiptune (it's pretty close to that) fan it's a feast, also giving the game a lot of momentum.","July 21, 2014","true","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you are one of those people who like to feel like a boss by immediately mastering a game and bragging about how easy it is then this is not the game for you.

The controls are fantastic and responsive, which is important because it can be a difficult but never unfair game. You can do some surprisingly cool stuff with the 1 button combat which is nicely flushed out with a mass number of environmental hazards you can send baddies into.\n\nThe Lovecraft vibe and graphics go well. Everything is very clear and it doesn't feel like they went with old school graphics for the sake of cutting corners. Pixel art is nicely animated. I got a bit of a nostalgic feeling, but your character can just do so much more than old 8 bit games.\n\nEverything in the game feels very intuitive, and just exactly what I want from a platformer. The checkpoint system in which you make your own, is a really cool touch, and keeps the game fun and not frusterating despite it's challenge level. When you do get frustrated, just kick a couple monsters into buzz saws and you'll feel much better.\n\nLast but not least, the soundtrack is awesome.","May 23, 2014","true","405.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is hard. Like Dark Souls ain't got nothing on it. It's probably on par with I Wanna Be The Guy in terms of difficulty, but this is just a straight up challenge as opposed to IWBTG's cheap tricks. The game is fair, but you WILL screw up, and when you do, you are going to get frustrated.\nNow that being said, that is not a negative aspect. This game's challenge allows for a great deal of playability, making you want to try again and again to succeed. In addition, the art in the game is amazing. The pixel art style lends itself very well to the genre. The controls are smooth, the combat is great and has a very good combo system. The music is great as well, and very much suits the environment.\nThe aesthetics are great as well. It's largely dark and gloomy, as you'd expect from a Lovecraft-inspired game, but this just allows for the brighter colors (like the copious amounts of red you will see) to cut through and provide an effective contrast.\nStrongly recommend, unless you get put off by intense challenge.

It features fast-paced skill-oriented combat and movement, beautiful pixel style cutscenes and in-game graphics, and an intriguingly dark storyline.\n\nPROS:\n-Combat feels fluid, well-paced and simple, yet complex enough to keep things interesting\n-Graphics are carefully and thoughtfully designed. Beautiful scenery coupled with excellent level design makes for a great combination\n-This game is difficult, and thats a good thing. It is horror themed after all\n-The soundtrack is uniquely dark and upbeat. Balances well with the gameplay\n-The storyline is a step above general "save-the-princess" platformers, so thats a plus\n-Ingenious check-point system that puts control in the hands of the player and allows for awesome speedrun opportunities\n-Well-crafted characters/enemies that stand out\n-Good variety and complexity in puzzles and challenges\n\nCONS:\n-Personal gripe: Menus felt a bit cluttered and unweildy, but maybe thats just me\n-Difficulty fits well in both categories I believe, some may find it off-putting\n-Enemy variety can become a bit tiresome by the end\n\nOverall "They Bleed Pixels" offers a uniquely addictive horror/platformer experience in a delightfully dark package complete with stunning visuals and a remarkably fresh style of gameplay. While there are areas to be polished (as with any game) and the difficulty of the gameplay may be too much for some, those who stick through to the end are guaranteed a rewarding experience.","June 30, 2014","true","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is my favourite indie retro platformer and I have played Fez, SMB, Braid and lots more. TBP gets everything right and should be considered a classic among the great retro platformers.\n\nTight controls, great level design, surprisingly sophisticated combo system with juggles and the ability to incorporate the many environmental hazards into them. It's endless fun finding new and creative ways of juggling the bad guys onto some spikes or saw blades. The design is also very solid with one of the most effective uses of pixel art I have seen to date and great sound effects, the animation reminds me of Lemmings in that it has the maximum fluidity with the minimum amount of pixels.\n\nI haven't had this much fun playing a single player game in a while. Highly recommended if you like challenging platform games and especially if you also play fighters.\n\nNote: At the moment there are no resolution options, however they are working on a full re-write that adds this and improves many other technical aspects which is near completion.","June 26, 2014","true","5.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can take about one step in a direction before you break out into a full run which makes the sections where you have to position yourself precisely on an elevator platform to dodge hazards extremely frustrating.

A must have for speed runners and platform lovers alike (though I wouldn't admit to that last one. Don't think your parents would approve of you sticking it in a wall now would they?)\n\nDespite this, the game isn't all that memoriable in my books. I think the main reason for this is the combat mechanics. As much as the levels are designed around using every possible move you have, it kind of makes a waste of a lot of things. For one, it's very existence. You shouldn't use combat to interact with the environment, you should use it to beat up baddies or something, not stop by and  smell the roses. Enemies are usually nothing more than something to have fun with or a hindrance. you'll either be forced to kill them to proceed (some sections require you to dispose of them just to walk through a small pathway, which will just devolve into you kicking them further down it) or will be purposefully set up so you can kick it into a buzzsaw or a bed of spikes, just to validate the combat's existence.\n\ntl;dr play for the platforming, not the action. or the eldritch horror.

If that's what you're into it definitely delivers.\n\nSome of my followers wanted a more complete review of the game, so I'm obliged to give this game a little more thought.\n\nCONTROLS: The game controls roughly how you'd expect a 2d platformer to control if you've ever played one in your entire life. The main difference being their prized "intense one button combat". Which is interesting in theory, and in practice is frustrating and unintuitive. Awkward pauses in movement and attacks are required to execute any sort of combo, and most of the combos come down to "kick enemy into spikes" Even once you get past the awkward control scheme, combat is next to impossible on ice, so you'll probably just end up avoiding enemies or jumping over them and down attacking them repetedly\nCORE GAMEPLAY MECHANICS: This is a platformer after all, so let's talk about one of the core platforming values since the original Super Mario Bros. Momentum. Now some games can get away with not using momentum, Rogue Legacy comes to mind with it's challenges requiring super tight control over your character. And some of the well know classic platformers like the orginal Mario and Sonic games benefit a great deal from the ability to use momentum to your advantage. They Bleed Pixels trys to have it both ways and it just doesn't work. It feels like the ground and air mechanics were built by 2 different people and they never communicated before releasing the game. You can build momentum on the ground, but all of that momentum is lost the instant you jump. I can see why they did this, in the interest of having those tight controls in the air needed to avoid traps and enemies, but something wrong happens when you bring these mechanics to ice. And believe me, much of the games platforms are ice. See if you build momentum on ice, then jump, the momentum is lost immediately, but as soon as you land the momentum you had on the ground is back. This is about where I closed and uninstalled the game, because this mechanic was just so bafflingly backwards that I felt wrong just having it on my hard drive. It makes even simple platforming aggravating because your character is following two different sets of rules for air and ground movement.\nSTORY: The story is cute. A+.\nOverall I really wanted to like this game, I love 2d platformers and it's inspiring that the quality of games made by indie developers has gotten to this point, but poor controls and awkwardly handled mechanics made it just about impossible to enjoy this game.","December 23, 2013","false","0.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","2"

Don't forget to press forward while you attack otherwise you will just kick your enemy away but be careful because the first attack you do while pressing forward is a dash move.

The game tries to be both a precision platformer as well as a beat-em-up, but those two genres rely on completely opposing forces: the beat-em-up doesn't want the level to play exactly the same each way, where the precision platformer NEEDS it to, or it only becomes frustrating.

Theme-wise, it's a very dark, almost gothic kind of universe with alchemy and magical rituals and all manner of occulty goodness so if you're looking for a more noire-niche way to rip your hair out, look no further.\n\nThose who've played a lot of the more recent platformers like Super Meat Boy and to a much lesser extent, I Wanna Be The Guy, will have a ton of fun with this in that there's actually a way to defend yourself, engaging you with what you're playing a little more, or so I like to think. The controls are supurbly tight, which is a must for players trying to optimize speed runs and keep the adrenaline going, as well as the instant continuing after you're killed by something. Which EVERY GAME SHOULD HAVE ALWAYS. ALWAYS. (Which, also, the nice about it being that dying didn't immediately mean the end of a record run)\n\nI find the collectables to be really well placed and the scaling of difficulty in finding them, really thoughtful. The enemies were one of the things I had to say I was quite happy about. At first when you hear from someone else that you see the extent of the enemy list in the span of a few pages you think the game will turn out a bit dull but they use even the first thing you see, the shambler, in the most creativelly annoying ways possible, which I was pretty impressed with.\n\nI have to say I've put a lot of time into playing now and I would love to complete it but I don't have the attention span. It's not impossible for a casual gamer to get every blood badge but you'd have to be dedicated. In some respects it reminds me a lot of The Dishwasher: Dead Samurai but much less combat based, though there will be blood, delicious glorious blood in the form of pixels.\n\n4.5/5","November 3, 2014","true","23.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The dev promised a patch or rework a year ago and it hasn't been delivered. I would be happy with a sqeuel, but neither that happened.\nThe levels are long, way longer than in SMB, you have checkpoints that you adquire by collecting, em points? or coins that you get by killing and doing combos or picking up the red bloody coins.\n\n\nThe controls are also a problem, you kick and punch with the same key, but to punch you have to hold directions and "action button" lets call it, to kick (doesn't do damge) you press the button and to kick vertically you hold the button, so in an action platformer you got 3 actions in the same button... not a wise decision.\n\n\nI got until the very end (or almost) and I gave up (temporaly).

You will die. A Lot. I'm not JUST saying that because I died a lot, but because the games platforming and level design is such that you won't always know what lies ahead. Some quick reflexes may save you in most situations, but it's likely that the game's architecture changes at that one critical moment to make you slide instead of stop, or have floating enemies chase after you through intense buzz saw blade platforming elements.\n\nI had fun though. I tried to get all the pages, but around chapter 3 they start placing them in unkown sectors of the level and you'll have to send your little girl flying out into a bed of spikes to try and find where they placed it. Still, if you like that kind of platforming challenge, the control and execution in this game is really technical and can satisfy that urge to "get it perfect" and a lot of the levels, though they took me a half hour to get through, can be beaten in under 5 minutes.\n\nSo yes, I recommend this game, It's fun, well built, has that unfair platforming design, but some people like that. I did, until I just couldn't take it anymore.","November 23, 2014","true","5.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I have never seen so many spikes in a game. I have never felt so helpless and poorly equipped as when wall jumping over instadeath pits and voids that make up 90% of the colorless, lazy, black-block levels and having to dodge super tiny enemies with no air-dash or secondary jump ability after attack or invincibility frames. In a game with a lot of jumping, there is only one air move. And Mario has none but he can at least bounce on enemies. You just slash, lose all momentum, and get the less powerful second jump and then plummet if you try anything. You get molested at every turn, forced to either eternally wall jump in space, or maneuver through bouncing saws while dodging highly liberally used slippery patches that makes you a bouncy ball of perpetual motion and disable wall jump so you can get railroaded into the hardest path. I mean forget exploring or learning how to complexly avoid obstacles using your game knowledge, you're going through every single one because the developer's mouse got stuck painting the tiles in spike and slippery blocks. Don't think. Just jump on the obvious and only path and hope the enemies don't get smart and attack you at the right moment or make you hit a saw.\n\nI also feel no incentive to master the combat system since the button for doing every move, at least on gamepad, is the same one. This sounds good, but there are a ♥♥♥♥-ton of other buttons on this controller or on a keyboard and I'd like to be able to fight without having to alter my movement to perform a certain move to keep a combo up or displace an enemy while super fast monsters with 4 pixel wide hitboxes dance on my soon-to-be-corpse. Additionally the combat actual has no use except in gauntlet rooms and displacing enemies that are basically just walls to make you hit moving saws. Yes it gives you blood for check points, but you can get that just juggling and air-stabbing in quiet areas, which are the areas you'd expect a built in checkpoint to be at. Also also, the enemies don't really fight. The big ones get pummeled and the small ones just throw themselves at you at high speeds.\n\ntl;dr: Bad lazy level design + poor platforming integrated with lackluster combat = wish this was better but it isn't, please avoid unless you like IWBTG because this is easier than that but apparently of the same design paradigm but somehow more repetitive\n","May 21, 2015","false","4.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Grapplejack/recommended/211260/","Grapplejack","[♖] Rook","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Grapplejack/","467 products in account","Do you want to play a game that attempts to emulate both the difficult platformer style of Super Meat Boy along with the combat-oriented combo gameplay of sidescroller wallhangers like Mark of the Ninja? Would you like to play a game that does both of these very poorly compared to these two games? Then They Bleed Pixels is for you.\nThe platforming portion lacks invulnerability frames, which is my biggest complaint. Invuln frames in games like these are there on purpose; it allows you to bend and enhance the puzzles and gives your players a chance to avoid facemashing into a spike wall without the ability to correct yourself. It also fails to add anything to the gameplay, which would be the only reason for taking it out. The fact that it isn't here shows the developer either doesn't grasp the intricacies of these type of platformers or took the game in a different (albeit poorly-done) direction.\nThe combat has several issues; the lack of real combos is one, as well as lacking a good anti-air or up-attack, something you think would be fairly easy to do for the heroine, given her giant claws. Another problem is that your attacks and moves all come out slower than those of your opponents, who usually tend to have smaller hitboxes or are constantly moving faster than you can, which puts pressure on the system. A good combo system or the ability to punch past enemies would be extremely helpful as well, but the game lacks these features.\nIn short, it isn't good. But the art style is fantastic and the guest levels, which are supposed to be bonus add-ons, tend to play better than the main game. But I can't stop playing it.","December 2, 2013","true","12.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Retro-looking games are a dime a dozen these days (sometimes literally, depending on the Steam sale), and none of them really stand apart. But this game manages to balance retro styling and interesting and even pretty aesthetic very well. The platforming is exactly as hard as it should be. It's Super Meat Boy levels of difficulty, while still being very fun to play. It doesn't go too far like I Wanna Be the Guy or similar titles that are basically just torture platformers. The combat in this game is simple, but still very satisfying and fun, as well.\n\nFor what it's worth, the recommended specs are way off. You hardly even have any need for a video card at all if you've got a somewhat modern Intel CPU. Intel's HD Graphics can handle this game just fine. I'm sure AMD's APUs perform just as well. I can't really say "better," because there's no room for improvement.

There are 4 things that try to kill you, unless you count the guy that always blows himself up.  you can survive 2 total blows from any thing that doesn't instantly kill you like giant, bloody, white tooth-picks or giant crusher claws that turn you into a liquid somehow.

The terrain you can walk on or stick to is pure black, and all the environmental hazards (such as spikes and circular saws,) are pure white, standing out against the fantastical backdrops, that might not sound like a big deal, but it keeps things clear and concise.

When I first started it up I expierenced major lag, but the day after I fixed it. Although I'm not quite sure my fix would work on all computers; all I did was\n\nTurn on Window Mode\nTurn off Vsync\nTurn off Visual FX\nand then poof, no more lag.\nThe cutscenes have a nice, retro feeling to them, as the ENTIRE game is in 8 or 16 bit. (don't quote me on it I'm not an expert on pixelology)\nThe game has a nice pace, and the levels are extremely fun. Although, the game is very short. But the devs say they're working on more levels like the ones you can find in the extra tab. So I'm excited for that.\nEven though the game is short, it will still take a while (enless you're a ♥♥♥♥ing god that can beat Super Meat Boy in 30 minutes or whatever. Make that 40 actually)\n\nGameplay is nice, with one button styled combat and rewarding combos. Very easy combos, especially in the first and second dreams. The wall jumping is a nice feature, although I've had some problems with it at times. Mainly because I also go blue hedgehog level fast. So I always just fall off the walls. The jumping is also pretty good too.\n\nAs I've said before, the game is retro themed, all the cutscenes, the entire game is made out of pixels, hence the title "They Bleed Pixels". And oh God will you notice that they bleed pixels. Indeedly so.\n\nI give the game a 8/10\nVery well made, extremely fun, somewhat frustrating at times (especially if you unleash your rage at difficult games like this and Super Meat Boy), Rewarding combos, fitting graphics and an extremely smooth expierence.\n\nGet this game if you haven't already.","January 2, 2014","true","3.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I approach life's challenges with poise and restraint, taking time to casually find my way through each moment. However sometimes I come across a game that just makes me lose my f*****g s**t. In the past, it was the many iterations of Ninja Gaiden that brought about the doom of many a controller. And then there was Super Meat Boy, an exercise in frustration that I still have not fully conquered to this day. And now in the summer of 2012 I have met my new nemesis, They Bleed Pixels. And oh, what an adorable harbinger of destruction she is.\n\nSo imagine if you will a gloriously challenging platformer that demands exact finesse in the vein of the Nintendo-hard games of yore, complete with retro graphics, tight controls, and a rockin chiptune-inspired soundtrack (by DJ Finish Him no less!). That is They Bleed Pixels in a grotesquely Lovecraftian nutshell. When the young heroine is sent to a reform school she uncovers a necronomicon-esque book that fills her dreams with nightmarish horror as she is transformed into an eldritch crab-clawed zombie warrior who must cleanse the world of the undead.\n\nAll that side, what really sets They Bleed Pixels out from the crowd is the well thought out control system. Using a standard Xbox360 controller is the best way to experience the carnage, with it's tightly tuned context-sensitive actions that will keep the combos (and the blood) flying. Another nice touch is the way the save system works. By building up your combo chains and collection blood orbs, you gain energy to leave behind a "save sigil". As long as you find a safe spot with no traps or monsters nearby, you can place one almost anywhere, and whenever you die you will continue from it.\n\nAll in all the only downside to They Bleed Pixels it is that once the game is over, there's really no way to extend the fun. Hopefully Spooky Squid will someday release a level editor, as I'm sure that fans would enjoy trying their hand-- err claw, at making their own masterpieces of mayhem. Don't get me wrong though, They Bleed Pixels is still a complete experience, and very well polished at that. Fans of the genre should definitely pick it up ASAP.","December 3, 2013","true","0.2"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","1"

It seems uneccesary using only one button. Fighting airborne enemies (outside of launched shamblers) is awkward. It feels like you should pause momentarily when attacking in the air or something.\n\nThe platforming controls, however, are spot on. Movement (usually) isn't too slippery, jump height is very controllable, and it's easy to jump on/off walls. The dash is also useful. It's very satisfying when you successfully navigate a dangerous segment.\n\nThe two gameplay styles didn't always mix that well for me, unfortunately; it can be frustrating having to fight enemies when trying to avoid obstacles, and vice versa.\n\nThe most unique mechanic is the ability to place your own checkpoints. It's cool and intuitive. Honestly, I'm surprised no other game (that I know of) has anything similar. This idea seems a little token in the later levels, though, as safe spots are both rare and specific.\n\nThe cutscenes are neat - equal parts cute and creepy. It's a nice (as far as that word can be used with the subject matter) little story, and can be easily ignored if you don't care for it. I especially like the protagonist's design.\n\nOutside of the cutscenes, the audio and visual presentation is good, but not outstanding. The backgrounds are pretty, though.\n\nUltimately, though, this game is a precision platformer. Your decision to get it or not should reflect that. There's no unfair hidden traps or anything, but there will be plenty of deaths from missed jumps or poor timing. If you can deal with that, you'll like this game. Otherwise, stay away.

Just making it through the levels is pretty challenging, but if you're going for completion, get ready to start tearing your hair out. The platforming on its own is fun, and you start off with double jump and wall climbing abilities (the latter being an obvious application of having claws for hands), and the enemies that aren't shamblers require some deftness and skill to dispatch safely, but combine them and things can quickly get hellish.\n\nFortunately, you get three hitpoints to work with, and when you activate a save sigil (read: checkpoint) you get them all back. Save sigils aren't located at designated points, but are earned through collecting blood drops and killing enemies (higher combos earn sigils faster), and can then be created on (non-icy) flat ground a safe distance from death traps (stationary floor spikes don't block sigils, fortunately).\n\nUnfortunately, some of the difficulty comes from controls or mechanics that could use minor tweaks. Movement (especially while jumping) could be a little tighter, and this is particularly noticeable on sections full of icy platforms, when landing with even no horizontal momentum still causes the player to slip forward at surprising speed, often towards spikes or buzzsaws. The two button controls can be unecessarily restrictive. Stab and kick are assigned to the same button, depending on whether you press just attack or also hold left/right. The problem occurs when you want to dash, which uses the exact same key combination as stab, but when you're already moving. This is an issue that could have easily been avoided by making kick and stab two different buttons. Additionally, the rebound from hits is pretty severe, which can be incredibly frustrating on small platforms, and while recovery is fairly quick, there is no temporary invulnerability following a hit, which combined with the knockback can turn a minor misstep into instant death.","November 6, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The music is great and fits the setting and story.\nThe best thing with the game is the checkpoint system which you can set yourself and is based on how well you jump through the map, or how well you execute your enemies; Either by combos or by knocking them into various dangerous contrapments, like buzzsaws and spike-pits.\n\nThat's where the good things end, more or less. From then on is just another masochistic suicide game where you will die over and over until your vision is so blurred from watching your heavily pixelated screen for too long.\n\nThe grabbing mechanic is sloppy as all hell, jumping works when it wants to, and according to the game; Letting go off of a wall counts as a jump. This makes wallclimbing not only a nightmare, but also a reoccuring part which you will hate forever on. All your attacks are bound to a single button. Innovative, I know! It's not like you have a whole keyboard/controller to bind things to. But I suppose the creators wanted the game to be able to play perfectly on a NES controller or something...\n\nOnce you bounce off of spikes twice, they give you a free jump for no reason, only for you to bounce off of the spikes again and die horribly, giving you a fraction of a second to think that you might actually survive actually touching a spike for once. And yes, the spikes. The sharp and deadly things covering 97.5% of every wall, floor, and ceiling of the whole game. Another 2% is then covered my moving sawblades, which will happily not only deal damage to you, but send you flying in a wild different direction, and get you killed in ways you'd find almost unimaginable.\n\nRamping difficulty is not present in any shape or form after the starting area on the first level. There's no area between "First baby's steps" and "Welcome to hell: By the time you are done with a single level, you will already have forgotten about any kind of story or plot".\n\nThere's two difficulty settings however to choose from before you start the game; Which are "Novice" and "Standard".\nThese should actually be called "♥♥♥♥-Easy with no unlocks or rewards" and "Very Hard".\n\nThe game isn't impossible to play for us mortals, but unless you are extremely patient and don't mind dying on the same spot for thirty minutes, only for you to finally pass that one point only to find yet another spot to die on for thirty minutes, then go on and play this game.\n\nThe game would do better on a handheld, since it makes you forget about time and space, and is a great way to kill time. But if you're sitting in front of your computer, there are far more interesting games to spend your time and money on.","February 7","false","1.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It's close to being a good precision platformer and it has a lot of good ideas. Unfortunately it focuses too heavily on its less-than-stellar combat system. The scoring is mostly based around the combat hence me not even bothering most of the time. The collection element of the game is nice though. I liked that. What I don't like is the worst ice physics ever implemented in a game. Yeah, you can never stand still on ice, woohoo! Another gripe I have with the game engine is often that you let go of a wall when attempting to jump off it and usually die as a result. I forget what the buttons were to jump and to let go but I know they used a similar combination (jump off a wall uses two, one of which is the same button that makes you let go of the wall, I believe?)\nThis is mostly just what I remember off the top of my head so it's kind of rambly and bad as a review. The level design is generally pretty diverse and follows a decent difficulty curve (getting pretty tough by the end though the hardest parts of that for me were, again, combat-related). It's not entirely bad as a platformer, certainly far superior to Super Meat Boy at the very least, but there's room for improvement and it's not really for me in the end.","April 4, 2014","false","20.9"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Frustratingly hard but awesome combat and puzzles.\n\nRest of the review:\n\nThey Bleed Pixels is about as awesome as a 2D platformer can get.  It has good music, retro sound effects, lots of pixel blood, and danger around every corner.  It also has smooth controls and combat that feels satisfying.\n\nThe combat involves learning which moves to use on which enemies and how and where to strike those enemies.  The moves include kicking, stabbing, and launching.  You can kick enemies into the air to either juggle them or launch them into environmental dangers.  Your moves also allow you to jump, double jump, slide, slam, and rush through obstacles in each level.  You can hit enemies into other enemies and use enemies as part of level-based puzzles.\n\nThe controls are fairly simple and very comfortable.  You do not need a gamepad.  The movement on keyboard isn't much different from a gamepad, but I frequently chose to use my Xbox 360 controller due to the joystick being a lot more controllable than WASD keys, allowing me to more easily control the character's left and right movement speed.\n\nThe game features a lot of blood in pixel art form.  I like the style of this game and welcome the blood, but blood shouldn't make or break this game.  The only reason I mention it is I feel that some people may wonder why the blood effect exists.  It isn't realistic, it just looks cool when you impale enemies.\n\nThe visuals of the game are very eye-catchy and fun in my opinion.  The player character is lovable due mostly to the cutesy art style.  The pixel art is animated fairly well.\n\nSound production quality is pretty high. The music, though I hardly remember it since I didn't listen to much of it, is very good.\n\nI got this game outside of Steam and later got a Steam copy, so don't take the lack of time investment as a sign of how long the game will last.  It is a lengthy game that I never actually completed.","July 21, 2013","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They Bleed Pixels is a 2D platformer/beat-em-up game. I haven't gone too far into the game, but feel I have played enough to give an opinion.\n\nStory-8/10\nI haven't really grasped the story in its entirety at this point but i'll try explaining it. The story is you are a girl going to a girl school. One day you are at the library and see a book bleeding. Curious, you grab the book and realize it's evil or something, so you bury it. The book wasn't happy about that, so in your dreams it turns you into a monster trying to escape other monsters that want you dead. You die in your dream, you die for real or something.\n\nGameplay-9/10\nThe gameplay is outstanding for me (although a bit repetitive). This game is very fast paced and is relatively difficult. Not only do you platform across stages, but you fight enemies along the way (I'll talk more about enemies later). The combat isn't limited to punches and kicks, however. The monster you become has claws and stuff that can stab enemies and perform several different moves. As well as your own weapons, the environment is a weapon as well! There are spikes and saw blades you can throw and kick enemies into (among other things), allowing for a wide range of ways to kill your enemies. The most unique part of this game to me is the Checkpoint system. In this game, you don't get a checkpoint halfway through the level. In this game, killing enemies and collecting certain objects in levels will allow you to CREATE the checkpoint (so long as there are no enemies or hazards nearby). There is a bar that, once filled, will allow you to create a checkpoint if you stand still and are not near anything hazardous to your health (a circle will grow and shrink around you to show the 'safe zone'). I feel this self checkpoint system is very unique and makes your deaths feel more like your fault rather than the games. This game also uses a 'heart' system for your health, allowing a few hits before death.\n\nEnemies-9/10\nThe enemies are varied throughout the game. I'm only a couple levels in and I have seen many different enemies. You've got the generic enemies, you've got bomb enemies (that can blow up other enemies), you've got flying enemies and so on. As well as the enemies you have saw blades that hurt and spikes that can insta-kill should you miss a jump. Both saws and spikes are abundant, but they are placed in ways you can't really fault. The saws are placed in places where you should think before acting, while spikes are basically a replacement for the 'bottomless pit' insta-kill from other platformers. The enemies all have a certain amount of hits and repeating attacks can not only make killing an enemy difficult, but may also give you less Checkpoint progress.\n\nSense of Progression-7/10\nMaybe I didn't play for long enough, but I had no real feeling of progression besides going to the next level. Cutscenes between levels were the same and I never really felt like I was going anywhere besides a new level.\n\nGraphics-8/10\nThe name may have tipped you off, but this game is in pixels, although that's not a bad thing. Colors are abundant and animations are smooth, making this game a treat to look at compared to other pixel games. However, textures are repeated time and time again to the point that seeing that enemy get impaled on a spike for the 7th time loses its charm. I won't fault the game for having simple graphics, just for not changing the formula often enough to make them seem like they actually attempted to make a pixel game look gory.\n\nOverall-8/10\nIs it perfect? No. Amazing? Less no, but still no. Worth playing? Definitely. If you're a fan of 2D platformers but are tired of games like Mario where jumping on the enemy is enough, this game would be a good choice. Don't go spending $30 on it, but if you can get it for $10 or less, I would recommend getting this game. It's difficult and it quickly loses its "Wow!" after a few levels, but if you can enjoy the gameplay and not the graphics or story, this game will give you a good time.","December 29, 2014","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I'd mainly recommend it to people who are looking for a fair and difficult challenge. Look elsewhere if you're looking for something that offers a great deal of gameplay variety or catches the essence or the atmosphere of Lovecraft.\n\nAs you might have guessed, I do have a number of things I don't like about the game. Ahem, ahem:\n- After a while, there's simply no new types of enemies to find anymore. Already after about 30% of the game, in fact. No new mechanics, either. No bosses. This is probably the biggest complaint I have with this game.\n- The interface and some of the graphic effects are in HD. This creates a bit of a clash with the game's old-school art style. The game's cutscenes look like they're from a Gameboy Advance game, the gameplay itself (mostly) looks like Gameboy Color on a ginormous screen - so far, completely fine - but then, the interface and the checkpoints look like Flash.\n- The story doesn't ever go anywhere. I know it's minimalistic and everything, but even NES games had more going on. I don't know anything about the protagonist or the villain, and I don't really know what exactly was going on in the game, either.\n- Not enough Lovecraft. Actually, not enough of anyone or anything, for that manner. This partly falls in line with my complaint about the story being too shallow, but there's not a whole lot of atmosphere, either.","December 27, 2014","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Right off, I reccommend this game; however, that being said, I have some major issues with the game. The game is an excellent, 8-bit style, hack and slash--which incourages stringed combos--somehow, reminicient of arcade platformers like Tekken and Streetfighter. The game insinuates a story, that really had potential, but like all too many platformers, completely fails at delivering. Performance is patchy; some surfaces and enemies cause near unplayable lag (drops as low as 3-8 fps), but as soon as they de-render, the game returns to the regular 50~fps. The game's controls are completely rebindable, which is great, as the defaults aren't optimum. I really wish there were some resolution options as well (locked at 720p, I think?). I read some reviews when the game came out, outlining these same issues--and purchased only recently, hoping that developers would make an effort to fix some pretty basic issues. My last, and biggest, issue with the game, is that hitboxes are terrible. I love platormers of this style, for quick-paced, careful gameplay. When hitboxes are larger or smaller than the displayed npc/surface, it's crap.\nSummarized::\nPros:\n-Cheap\n-Fun to pick up and play whenever\n-Interesting, dark style, that's actually well done\n-Actual fighting combos\n-Replayability\n-Rebindable controls\nCons:\n-Garbage hitboxes\n-Lack of npc variety\n-Basically half a story?\n-Graphics issues\nBuy it on sale, worth a few bucks, and a few more if things were fixed.

The game's platforming is brutal, and is generally much harder than the fighting. This game is also very deep, and it has many rewards for taking extra risks.\n\nThe control in this game is pretty tight, and that's a good thing, because the platforming is completely nuts. Even the game's first level is brutal. This is not a game to play to calm down, since it will frustrate you very quickly. Not even Super Meat Boy ramped the difficulty up this quickly. That said, the game does give you the opportunity to save at many points during the levels, and you will need all the help you can get. The fighting system is very fun and rewards style. It's a nice break from the platforming.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful. I never really noticed the sound because I was so focused on the game.\n\nThis game is not for kids, and it's not for the inexperienced player. If you're looking for the satisfaction for beating a tough level, this might be your game. I'd recommend Super Meat Boy over They Bleed Pixels, though. I think SMB was better designed overall. Either way, if this sounds like fun to you (you masochist), it will definitely be worth the $10.","June 24, 2013","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You will need dodge, duck, dip, dive, stab, slash, dash, and slam your way through various levels, jumping past countless environmental dangers, defeating all kinds of highly damaging enemies, all while progressing through a very Lovecraft inspired story.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed Super Meat Boy, or are a fan of difficult platformers, check this out.\n","September 14, 2012","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Better character, simple but efficient combat system, atmosphere, inspirations and story bits, and let's not forget about the music.

You will have to jump around and get into close corners. You will have to step out of your comfort zone as you progress through the levels. Platforming won't be stable and you need to adapt to that. There are very few safe zones. You are basically walking on thin ice 70% of the game. Act fast, take risks, don't be afraid to die. Yes you will DIE ALOT. You will go crazy hearing a girl's scream over and over again. Now here are some PROS and CONS I wrote in the bottom. When something goes sour or you lose one HP, it will most likely result in your death. You either can do it or not.\n\n\nPros\n\nI find difficulty to be a motivation for players like me to finish it. It is very brutal and has a bloody hack and slash system.\nIt never gets old kicking enemies into buzzsaws.\n\nHowver violence and gore is not what the game focuses on (although its there and everywhere).  The game focuses on the platforming and agility of jumping from point A to B even though it may use some combat. It gets your adrenaline up. Sometimes you will give up but thats fine. But if you are able to find some advance tech and watch speedrunners (like Squid Claw), it will make you believe you can do this. If you know what you are doing, then you will enjoy the game.\n\nThe checkpoint system is very unique. How it works is that you collect blood by killing enemies or just drops of blood in other areas. That fills up your meter, and when you fill that meter, you can stop moving and set up the checkpoint. Of course there are certain external conditions that could prevent you from placing a checkpoint, but most of the time without enemies you can do it. I cannot name another game that does this. It is such an efficient system which reduces alot of frustration and time. Like Ninja Gaiden Black has you do the same frustrating stuff when you die at a very far spot. Why should I face all these stressful parts again if I died at an area so far?\n\nThe backgrounds are well designed but how they use it is more at the cons section I have below this. The pixel asethetic is really nice. If this game wasn't using it, I wouldn't get that retro horror feel.\n\nCons\n\nThe game says the controls are easy because there are only two buttons. However the attack button has more than one function. So if you condense alot of functions into one button, you are risking players to press the right button but the WRONG move. It's very easy to do something you did not mean to do, which is poor game design. They could have at least set up a separate dash button.\n\nIf it were one major thing I would add in the game is boss levels. After I finished the game, I felt empty, and that was because there aren't any boss battles. I won't go into details in the end, but there will be no boss battle. I would be perfectly okay with all the other flaws it had, but it needs boss battles.\n\nThe background artwork is good. What isn't good is the fact that they just had dark silhouette platforms. You could forget that you are in a forest, under water, or in pits of hell. It takes away the theme a bit. I would be impressed if they could add more detail in the platforms to blend in with the background.\n\nOverall:\n\nSo the game is difficult, weird controls, and very stressful. Would I play it again? Not really, but its fun playing once. Platforming fans looking for difficulty will want to play this. So spend the 14 bucks if you looking for a challenge.","March 6, 2015","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That was fixed once I disabled v-sync (♥♥♥♥ v-sync, I have yet to find a ♥♥♥♥ing game where it is actually useful and doesn't erect a barrier on enjoying the game).\n\nOnce we're over all of the issues, the game itself is short and fun, although nothing too innovative. Some areas were really annoying to get through. The 3-hits system is useless half of the time, when you get hit, chances are you'll get bounced around and get the other 2 hits without even getting a chance to recover.\nI hate slippery floor mechanics, but they are part of the game and thankfully they are used sensibly. There were a few points in the game that if the developers had used slippery floor as well, I would have had uninstalled the game, right there.\nThe controls feel a bit weird but you can get used to them. The endgame stuff is very frustrating, as to be expected. It's not IWBTG-tier ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but expect to rage a bit...\nIt feels like the hitboxing is crap. Sometimes you can get away with almost headbutting spikes, but get just a bit close to a saw, not even touching it, and you'll get juggled around the map.\nThere are some extras that you can unlock by getting achievements... I say ♥♥♥♥ that, getting through those stages without dying is tougher than you think it is >_>\n\nI'd say, grab this game in a sale and give it a try.","November 9, 2013","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is somewhat similiar to Super Meat Boy...but that isn't entirely right. It shares SMB's percision, tight controls, and OCD for making the exactly right move at the exactly right time. You also get a parade of your deaths, though not in the same way. Conversely, TBP is more complex, due to its larger range of moves, and less focused on long stretches of hair tearing, due to it's more lenient save mechanism (the difficulty is still pretty brutal though). Similarly, the stages are longer, but the game is shorter. For replay value, there are over 150 achievements, and three (soon 4) bonus levels. Notably, the achievements actually do things (unlock art, most of which is pretty nice). Visuals are nice and simple, with some very cool effects. The music is nice too, if chippy.\n\nOverall, I enjoy this one, and would recommend it.","January 8, 2013","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're a die-hard fan of games like Super Meat Boy, and I wanna be the guy, then I reccomend this. If not, then stop reading.\nThis game, is fun, and teaches you what you need to know early, so that it can absolutely make you feel awful later for screwing up. The first couple of levels provide a fine, and fun challenge, which will likely kill you a few times, but you get teh hang of it. Then the difficulty goes way, way, way up. The ability to get a checkpoint is practically stripped from you in some instances, despite being fully able to do so, if you could just sit still for a moment, and the enemy placement is cruel, forcing you to either spend way too much time trying to get passed a small section. Personally, I gave up at Chapter 2's second level, simply due to the fact that the Ice physics are some of the most mean I have ever seen in a game, and the fact that the enemies make it nigh impossible to NOT get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at it. But I'm not hardcore into platformers like that--so if you are, and think that the inability to stop moving, combined with pits of ultra-mega-death and checkpoints that take Oh so long to get back to where you were from, is a challenge worth conquering, then feel free to attempt to do so.

I died several hundred times on a few of the levels, and yes, it was infuriating at times, but not b/c it required pixel perfect precision like SMB, but rather b/c what I needed to accomplish always seemed just slightly out of reach of my rickety old hands.  The game does allow you do make your own checkpoints once your blood meter fills up, having killed enough enemies, and it is a joy to perform simple combos and find different ways to kill your foes.  Just know that there will be times you will want to throw your controller (try not to hit your big shiny flatscreen), blame the controls for your screw-ups, and you will curse this game repeatedly.  The levels are lengthy; so it's not so much a continuous stream of bite-sized levels like MeatBoy, it's more akin to Electronic Super Joy in that regards, but not quite as unforgiving.  The squids are a horribly infuriating, cheap enemy, and at times, the knife wielding ninjas (?) can seem a bit unfair, but if you're into hardcore ultra-difficult platformers, they will probably seem like standard affair.  One cool aspect is that there are several bonus levels that you can unlock, and I believe one of them was unlocked by default.  I didn't do the Ponycorn bonus content; I chose one of the others that I unlocked and that was enough for me.  I really liked the game, but it's very stressful for me to play, so I had no intention of doing all of the bonus stuff.  Some of the artwork that you can unlock is very good, too.  Unless you're a completionist, you may want to check online to see which slots unlcok which art pieces, b/c the styles vary and I found that the photorealistic ones were more preferable to my taste.  Now, I will nto spoil the ending, but just be warned that it is rather anti-climactic.  This game is more about the journey than the destination, and it was definitely worth the few dollars I paid to buy this game on sale.  Hopefully it won't take most people the 31 hours it took me to complete it.  As angry as the game made me, my eagerness to see new levels kept me pushing through, b/c the art style is really interesting, and far more preferable to Super Meat Boy or Electronic SuperJoy.","July 3, 2014","true","33.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game's platforming is brutal, and is generally much harder than the fighting. This game is also very deep, and it has many rewards for taking extra risks.\n\nThe control in this game is pretty tight, and that's a good thing, because the platforming is completely nuts. Even the game's first level is brutal. This is not a game to play to calm down, since it will frustrate you very quickly. Not even Super Meat Boy ramped the difficulty up this quickly. That said, the game does give you the opportunity to save at many points during the levels, and you will need all the help you can get. The fighting system is very fun and rewards style. It's a nice break from the platforming.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful. I never really noticed the sound because I was so focused on the game.\n\nThis game is not for kids, and it's not for the inexperienced player. If you're looking for the satisfaction for beating a tough level, this might be your game. I'd recommend Super Meat Boy over They Bleed Pixels, though. I think SMB was better designed overall.

You can get better with the controls, but making the kick, up kick, attack, dash attack, up attack, dash down attack, ect - all the same button sucks.  So many deaths by trying to kick, and instead I dash forward into a spike wall... or jump attack and instead fall through the floor.\n\nAlso - there is no "Run" button, so if you walk more than one step, you run.

The player gets their kicks by controlling the fountain of blood in the shape of a little girl that is the protagonist, but the game itself will also gets its kicks in the form of all the cutting, stabbing, and impaling that it does to the player.\n\nThis game's greatest feature is that it's hard, but in the best kind of way.  The controls are extremely intuitive and always spot on, and every death (there will be many) feels justified and avoidable.  The player must master the controls quickly, because the difficulty quickly ramps up and stays there.  Luckily, the difficulty is offset by the highly enjoyable combat, wonderfully gory pixel graphics, and the fact that most of the harder challenges are completely optional.  A competent mastery of the controls is necessary to complete the game properly, but the completion of the deadliest (and most frustrating) challenges is never a requirement.\n\nThe game is nail-bitingly difficult, but its relative shortness and the freshness of the content means that it doesn't overstay its welcome.  If you are looking for a dark and necrotic twist on finger gymnastics, give They Bleed Pixels a try!","December 28, 2012","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is somewhat similiar to Super Meat Boy...but that isn't entirely right. It shares SMB's percision, tight controls, and OCD for making the exactly right move at the exactly right time. You also get a parade of your deaths, though not in the same way. Conversely, TBP is more complex, due to its larger range of moves, and less focused on long stretches of hair tearing, due to it's more lenient save mechanism (the difficulty is still pretty brutal though). Similarly, the stages are longer, but the game is shorter. For replay value, there are over 150 achievements, and three (soon 4) bonus levels. Notably, the achievements actually do things (unlock art, most of which is pretty nice). Visuals are nice and simple, with some very cool effects. The music is nice too, if chippy.\n\nOverall, I enjoy this one, and would recommend it.","January 8, 2013","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is fun. Hard as all hell, but fun. I would honestly recommend this game to anyone itching for a fun challenge. I don't see myself ever going for the top of the leaderboards or anything on this one, but at the end of a level I honestly feel like I'm accomplished something, and that's nice.\n\nI love the design of this game. Ya' it's the over done pixelated motif, but the colors and all around art direction of the game makes up for that. If the game were done some other way it would probably lose some of it's charm if anything. The game play is really nice too. It's quick, responsive, and challenging. Generally speaking I can tell when I've screwed up and how I screwed up. When I keep slipping up it just gives me more practice the next time. Usually within a couple of goes I can get an area memorized well enough to get past it.\n\nThe down side to this might be that if the pixel-art type game isn't your thing you might not like this one. The other downside being that some of the enemies are a little annoying (specifically the flying squids). They're so small that they're very hard to hit and most of the time just trying to trick them into hitting a pointy part of the level worked better. Which is cool, but tough when theres multiple squids on the screen. Neither one of these is much of a downside though.\n\nI love this game, and I'm ashamed it took me so long to review the game. It really is a blast to play and even if I never complete it I still have fun with it.","January 11, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Frustratingly hard but awesome combat and puzzles.\n\nRest of the review:\n\nThey Bleed Pixels is about as awesome as a 2D platformer can get.  It has good music, retro sound effects, lots of pixel blood, and danger around every corner.  It also has smooth controls and combat that feels satisfying.\n\nThe combat involves learning which moves to use on which enemies and how and where to strike those enemies.  The moves include kicking, stabbing, and launching.  You can kick enemies into the air to either juggle them or launch them into environmental dangers.  Your moves also allow you to jump, double jump, slide, slam, and rush through obstacles in each level.  You can hit enemies into other enemies and use enemies as part of level-based puzzles.\n\nThe controls are fairly simple and very comfortable.  You do not need a gamepad.  The movement on keyboard isn't much different from a gamepad, but I frequently chose to use my Xbox 360 controller due to the joystick being a lot more controllable than WASD keys, allowing me to more easily control the character's left and right movement speed.\n\nThe game features a lot of blood in pixel art form.  I like the style of this game and welcome the blood, but blood shouldn't make or break this game.  The only reason I mention it is I feel that some people may wonder why the blood effect exists.  It isn't realistic, it just looks cool when you impale enemies.\n\nThe visuals of the game are very eye-catchy and fun in my opinion.  The player character is lovable due mostly to the cutesy art style.  The pixel art is animated fairly well.\n\nSound production quality is pretty high. The music, though I hardly remember it since I didn't listen to much of it, is very good.\n\nI got this game outside of Steam and later got a Steam copy, so don't take the lack of time investment as a sign of how long the game will last.  It is a lengthy game that I never actually completed.","July 21, 2013","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The "die 235+ times" difficulty only gets worse after 3-2, and the later worlds are tremendously unforgiving thanks to terribly sadistic spike and enemy placements. After the 300th time of trying to wall jump over ten gaps with saw blades spinning all around you and little squid enemies threatening to knock you backwards into spike pits, it just starts to feel painful.\n\nThe developers are working on a revision for the game that introduces a novice setting, but from what I saw of the current beta, the last level is still only available on standard difficulty. High scores and collectibles also aren't available in novice mode, which makes it clear that the developers really want you to embrace the obscene hardness of the game in the end. If you can handle the pain, then this is still worth your dollars, but it may stop being fun after a certain point.","December 22, 2014","false","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Finally getting one of the precision areas perfect is immensly satisfying and is the reason I'm still playing it.\n\nThis game takes time and practise.

The game mechanics are pretty simple but allow for a lot of variety in puzzle solving. The art style as the name suggests is cute pixelated gore. The upbeat chiptunes soundtrack adds to the fun (if you're into that style) and makes it feel fast. Dying over and over in the same place in this game is not nearly as rage-inducing as in lots of other games, because you can restart quickly, and because you can (sort of) choose where to set checkpoints. The only issue I have with the gameplay is sometimes there aren't strong visual cues where to go to progress, I basically just jump off a ledge and hope I don't die. Or maybe I just suck at navigating. Really fun game overall.","March 31, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, the single button combat system is very reminiscent of 'Super Smash Bros' even though it's nowhere near as complex, while the level design and character controls seem to have been taken directly from 'Super Meat Boy'. And while we're talking about it, if you thought that 'Super Meat Boy' was a difficult game, then look out for this one because it's much, much, much harder.

To preface my review, I must say that I am not a young gamer anymore, and these types of games pose a huge difficulty for me.  Honestly, I was never very good at video games, and I'm not even sure why I torture myself.  I suppose I couldn't resist satisfying my curiosity after suffering through about 30% of Super Meat Boy, seeing how this game looks much more interesting, with more visual appeal and a better sound track.  To cut to the chase, this game is HARD!!  I died several hundred times on a few of the levels, and yes, it was infuriating at times, but not b/c it required pixel perfect precision like SMB, but rather b/c what I needed to accomplish always seemed just slightly out of reach of my rickety old hands.  The game does allow you do make your own checkpoints once your blood meter fills up, having killed enough enemies, and it is a joy to perform simple combos and find different ways to kill your foes.  Just know that there will be times you will want to throw your controller (try not to hit your big shiny flatscreen), blame the controls for your screw-ups, and you will curse this game repeatedly.  The levels are lengthy; so it's not so much a continuous stream of bite-sized levels like MeatBoy, it's more akin to Electronic Super Joy in that regards, but not quite as unforgiving.  The squids are a horribly infuriating, cheap enemy, and at times, the knife wielding ninjas (?) can seem a bit unfair, but if you're into hardcore ultra-difficult platformers, they will probably seem like standard affair.  One cool aspect is that there are several bonus levels that you can unlock, and I believe one of them was unlocked by default.  I didn't do the Ponycorn bonus content; I chose one of the others that I unlocked and that was enough for me.  I really liked the game, but it's very stressful for me to play, so I had no intention of doing all of the bonus stuff.  Some of the artwork that you can unlock is very good, too.  Unless you're a completionist, you may want to check online to see which slots unlcok which art pieces, b/c the styles vary and I found that the photorealistic ones were more preferable to my taste.  Now, I will nto spoil the ending, but just be warned that it is rather anti-climactic.  This game is more about the journey than the destination, and it was definitely worth the few dollars I paid to buy this game on sale.  Hopefully it won't take most people the 31 hours it took me to complete it.  As angry as the game made me, my eagerness to see new levels kept me pushing through, b/c the art style is really interesting, and far more preferable to Super Meat Boy or Electronic SuperJoy.","July 3, 2014","true","33.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The difficulty curve is insane with the last few levels being way harder than the first few. Expect to die many times on a single area before moving forward. I would get this game if you really want a challenge and don't mind dying about 100 times per level.

The Save Sigil is a very innovative game mechanic and it allows you to decide when you want to save the game.\n\nWould you save now and be safe but run the risk of not getting enough energy for a Save Sigil later at a more important point? Or would you brave through the enemies awaiting you and use the Save Sigil at a more important point later in the stage?\n\nWhat would you choose?","July 14, 2013","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has some fun mechanics, mainly the checkpoint system and the nonstandard combat, and I think the game explores them well.\n\nIts not incredibly long but it felt long enough, and I feel inclined to go back through and score higher ranks on all the levels.\n\nThe game is really polished, to my surprise.
