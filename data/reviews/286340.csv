It's virtually an underwater version of minecraft, with rebuilding your sub as endgame. No sandbox mode, just 3 slightly different versions of a survival mode. I rarely see anyone with more than 10 hours of gameplay because really there's only about 5 in this before you have nothing left to do, with no real wish for a replay.\n\nPersonally, I suggest Subnautica for those interested in this, as it has regular updates and dev's that care.","January 13","false","7.1"," 301 of 331 people (91%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","91","301","331","14","0"

Fantabulous","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cpt_fantabulous/","668 products in account","I really want to recommend this game.\n\nIt has a really cool premise and it is pretty well realised.\n\nThe problem is that it is short as all hell. Unlike other "Minecraft-like" games out there this really does have a hard end point to it. Your objective is to collect all the pieces of your sub so that you can get back to the surface(which doesn't ,make sense but whatever VIDEO GAMES!) and once you have them all that is pretty much it.\n\nYou do unlock a sandbox mode but in playing the main game you will see everything the game has to offer. With the lack of mods and the Developer stating that they will not be adding any more content it is kinda hard to recommend.\n\nIt also has one of the worse save functions around. To save you have to quit out of your game completely. That would only be mildly annoying if the game didn't have a nasty habit of crashing to desktop. I stopped playing the game for a week after the game crashed as soon as I found the final piece of the sub. Losing me near to an hour of gameplay.\n\nSo in summation\n+Cool Premise\n+Nice Graphics\n+Nice Atmosphere\n-Very Short\n-No future support\n-terrible save function\n-Crashes alot\n","October 10, 2014","false","2.5"," 429 of 503 people (85%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","85","429","503","9","0"

Been following/covering it since it was in alpha, and let me tell you, it's come a long way. I haven't checked out too much of the release version yet, but I'm having a lot of fun so far. It's pretty impressive that it was all done by one guy.\n\nThe base difficulty is pretty reasonable. Weapons take a while to get and killing fish for food draws blood, which means you'll have sharks coming around and being jerks. Growing potatoes also takes a reasonably long time as well.\n\nIf you're into hanging around underwater, building houses and riding around with an underwater scooter, you should get this game.\n\nPutting this at the bottom so it doesn't get in the way of the review itself.

The object is to survive below water and reconstruct your submarine to get yourself back to the surface.\n\nThis game does offer a sandbox version to it, which has its limit of replayability.  You can play this game in 3 modes, adventurer, which is how everyone starts off (allows death and respawning). Survival mode where you have just one life and submarine pieces are harder to locate and sandbox mode which in some part requires you have played a few games in the first 2 modes to be able to play sandbox mode.\n\nThe game offers a grand total 8 predators that you can fight and kill in the game and 3 of the 8 are sharks, so really 6 different predators if you count sharks as one type.  AGAIN, this is an abandoned early access game thus why variety in predators is lacking.  Also, you have a grand total of 3 tools, also because it was abandoned.  This game has only 5 ores you can mine (not including crystals) to use in crafting...again lack of depth due to abandonment by developers.\n\nI have put many hours of game time into this game, most of which was done in early access hoping this game would get better and have more depth added to it, but like many other I was sorely misled that this game would become as great as its developers claimed it would be.\n\nThis game is absolutely fun to play, but can be played and won within 2-3 hours of game time. I still play this game often to see if I can beat it faster than the time before.  However, this makes the current asking price of $15 USD a ridiculous amount to ask for 2-3 hours of game play.  I DO RECOMMEND this game, as it IS GREAT to play!!!  But do not buy this game unless it is on sale at 33% off OR MORE.\n\nI struggled long and hard whether this game would get a thumbs up or thumbs down and I have to give it thumbs down as it is an abandoned game by its developers and it is criminally over priced for what it offers.  I do recommend buying it ONLY if it is on sale.\n\n\n\n","July 19, 2015","false","158.1"," 319 of 395 people (81%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","81","319","395","25","7"

The gameplay was simple, move the dolphin from the beginning of the stage to the end of the stage, avoiding or destroying obstacles in your path. But, it wasn't the gameplay that intrigued me the most about the game, it was the ambience - the sheer joy of being able to immerse myself within the superior graphics (of the time) and excellently composed music to create what felt to me the ideal oceanic environment. I still have the soundtrack on MP3, for when I wish to isolate myself within once again.\n\nWhen I purchased this game, I had high hopes that it would create a new dream of ambience, despite all of the negative reviews that I had perused, the simple gameplay mechanic really wasn't what I desired the most - in fact, it falls extremely short in depth of every other sandbox game that I have ever played. Yet, I was extremely disappointed after playing this game to realize that all of the potential for beauty that was promised was nothing more than an illusion designed simply to entice dreamers like us to waste our money on a poorly crafted attempt to make quick cash.\n\nThe music was engaging, until it became repetitive. The graphics were good, until I realized there was no way to interact. The extremely limited availability and flexibility of creation components destroys the "sandbox" quality of the game. The overly simplified equipment upgrade mechanics destroy the gameplay. The collision detection is broken. The interlude and story sequences are poorly written. There is absolutely nothing about this game that I can honestly compliment other than the fact that it had wonderful potential if the developers had not given up on it so early, but even then I just can't bring myself to admire those who choose to be lazy. I will *not* be purchasing another game from this developer ever again.\n\nI do not recommend purchasing this game based purely on disappointment that I have suffered, the empty promises, and poor overall quality of something that should have been a wonderous achievement.","November 5, 2014","false","10.6"," 416 of 531 people (78%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","78","416","531","17","8"

You can harvest resources like seaweed, fertilizer, dirt, sand, coal, iron, copper, gold, silver, crystals (they're just called crystals), and turn them to weapons, equipment, furniture, and buildings.\n\nHere are the differences between Minecraft and FarSky in terms of gameplay, not art:\n- Your tools and equipment (including armor) never break (very handy) since you need only three primary tools\n- You have three main tools: knife to cut or attack, harpoon (spear) gun, and drill (to harvest and mine all available resources, including sand)\n- You don't have to arrange items to create items. You just need to have the minimum resources to create and you can create how ever much you want.\n- Oxygen. Your character can only be outside for a limited time before you need to head back to a base to regain oxygen. It doesn't take long to refill.\n- Bases. You can't just build a base with sand, floors, walls, etc. You need to make an item that builds a base.\n- There is a plot. Which I will explain later.\n- Boss battles against a mother******in' KRAKEN. If you harvest their crystal they will attack you and your base until you die. Then they leave you alone.\n\nHere are similarities:\n- Hunger, if your hunger is up 100% you will start taking damage.\n- Mining resources and using those resources to make tools.\n- Pretty music and visuals.\n- Predators that attack more frequently at night. Never before had I had such sastifaction of killing a shark (an endangered species IRL). Nor the frustration of being attacked and killed by a shark (and pretty much anything that bites, stings, shocks, touches you even a little bit.\n- Open world exploration. You can explore deeper parts of the ocean when you have the advanced equipment to go deeper.\n\nPlot:\nYou are Nathan, a deep sea explorer of the coast of Austrialia, since everything underwater is out to kill you (including the jellyfish). For some reason, your submarine breaks apart into 9 pieces that scattered across the map. Your task is to get back all those parts and survive. You will have another researcher that will guide you and help you (a little bit). For the most part, you jump into the game with little to no help. Once you collect the 9 parts, you instantly rebuild your submarine and you can take it to the surface where you beat the game.\n\nOnce you beat the game, you can play sandbox mode.\n\nWhat's missing:\n- Bed or something to make it speed up time until morning.\n- Some kind of radar to detect enemies. You can get attacked at all sides and no idea where they are coming from, how many, then you die.\n- More story or tasks. I like that there is something more than surviving. Maybe look for lost treasure or something.\n- More creative ability like in Minecraft to build and do whatever you want.\n\n8/10.","February 1, 2015","true","3.3"," 220 of 266 people (83%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","83","220","266","23","0"

After a bit though, I had finished and waited for the next update. Only, there was no next update. I had heard there might be more added, but since the devs now claim this is the full game, I feel ripped off. It looked like more was going to be added on with more depths that we can go to, but that never happened. Quite frankly, this is not what invested 15 bucks in and this 'finished game' is definitely not finished. Yes it's a fun game, but when you're expecting more and more updates to come out, to find out that they no longer update it, that's a bit of a ♥♥♥♥ off. There are a lot better games to invest 15 bucks in, Terraria is cheaper and has a way larger amount of content. So rather than give these devs who just dropped the game and said 'it's finished', go give your money to devs who actually still do update their games with new content, even after it's supposedly finished.\n\nIt's really sad. This game had so much promise and yet, we get the short end of the stick with a game not even worth it's price tag.","March 31, 2015","false","0.6"," 194 of 237 people (82%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","82","194","237","10","0"

It is also essentially a tech demo.\n\nI cannot recommend it, mostly because there isn't much to it. There's no story to follow, the environment doesn't invite exploration, and the combat is unchallenging (although I appreciate the fact that it can be avoided almost completely). None of these is obligatory - if the game had just one strong feature, it would be enough. Sadly, it has none. The game's mood lasted for about ten minutes.\n\nThere is no interesting activity involved in finding resources, mining, or crafting - these systems exist in the game in a bare bones, token form. Base construction is essentially pointless: you may need to expand a bit in order to make room for crops, but that's it. You don't get to build anything pretty or impressive. Exploration is minimal: there are three "depth levels", each with its own look, but there's no constant re-discovery, like in games that actually manage to generate interesting landscapes. Everything looks the same here, and there's no storytelling through decorations. Pacing is non-existent, save for increased danger during the night. The winning strategy is to hide in the base until sunrise, which means you spend a few minutes doing nothing (you cannot "go to sleep" and jump forward).\n\nUnless you're specifically interested in performing a series of simplistic tasks in an underwater setting without thinking about it too much, this game has nothing to offer.","September 30, 2014","false","4.1"," 184 of 244 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","184","244","3","3"

Here are my thoughts.\n\nSince FarSky is tagged as "survival", "adventure", "indie", "sandbox", and "crafting", I'm obligated to compare and contrast it with Minecraft, which I also have played extensively. This game is not Minecraft. Its crafting system is much simpler. It has a goal, whereas Minecraft does not. It has an end; you can "win". The randomly generated world, while being large and immersive, is finite. The movement mechanics are much different as you're under water. The terrain cannot be deconstructed, but minerals can be mined from it.\n\nThe graphics are relatively simple, yet work quite well. All the plants and animals under the sea have convincing movements. The enviroment itself is very well done, between the day/night cycles, and the way it fades into a blue haze at a distance.\n\nThe game mechanics were fun. I could get around without any trouble. The combat system is not overly complex. It can be difficult, especially at night in the first days of the Survival mode, but becomes effortless later on.\n\nThe premise is that your submarine broke into 9 pieces during a dive, and you are marooned on the bottom of the ocean floor. You must survive, equip yourself, and find the 9 pieces of your submarine. Once you do, it will assemble, and you can ascend to the surface, thereby winning the game. The game itself is relatively short.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Argonov/recommended/286340/","Argonov","R KELLY'S JARATE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Argonov/","383 products in account","I really want to recommend this game. It has a fantastic atmosphere and at times can really make you stress out (in the suspenseful way).\n\nGraphics                 - 6/10 not the best, but far from the worst\nStory                       - 2/10 There atually is a story, but it was very basic and uninteresting\ndepth of gameplay - 3/10 no pun intended, this game is very shallow\nsound track             - 7/10 would be 10/10 but it wasn't very present in game\nDifficulty                 - 2/10 It really wasnt that difficult or challenging\nOverall                    - 4/10 Sub average\n\nThe graphics made the game easy to look at and the areas below 250m were beautiful. There are a lot of pretty lights and the creature designs get very creative.\n\nThe story is that you crash a submarine and it breaks to pieces and you have to put it back together. That is all there is to it. I may have missed something, but it did not explain who I am, or who the person is guiding me through this survival disaster. There is no putting the submarine together, it just happens. There are bases scattered in various areas with little explanation and it actually defeats the purpose of building your own base, which is a big part of sandbox games. The point of building the sub is not so you can continue whatever mission you had to complete, which would have made the game very interesting, but so you can float to the surface and be rescued. (none of this is a spoiler because the whole story is literally handed to you in the first 5 mins of the game). If you just build a water scooter, you can swim up to the surface but it blocks you with an invisible wall at 30m which just killed the immersion, and explains why building the sub to complete your mission is a much more intersting story prospect.\n\nDepth of gameplay\nThere jus isnt much to it. I will compare it to minecraft for this one. In minecraft, you make your own story because there is none. You mine resources for armor and weapons because they always break. You build multiple homes in different locations because it is beneficial. This game has none of that. You make an armor piece and you respwn with it when you die. When you die, you don't reload. You just magically reapear in your first base. All your droped loot is marked on the map and stored for easy access when you go back to it. It is really hard to get into this game because it honestly felt like the game was rushing me to beat it.\n\nThis game actually had a very good sound track. It was very ambient and soothing. The suspenseful sound track that plays when you attack a certain preditor is okay, but the ambient music more than makes up for it. My only complaint is that it didn't play enough in game. And the game only took about 2 hours to beat and I was taking my time with it, so if it played the same ambient track on a loop, I would not have gotten tired.\n\nThis game is not hard at all. I feel like survivor mode (unlocked by beating normal mode) would be kind of hard because there are more preditors, the sub parts arent marked on the map, and you only get one life. I'd try it but honestly, I'd either die and move on, or reach a point and get bored from always having to roam the ocean floor in a grid trying to find these parts, which even though they are engulfed in giant obvious glowing lights, only become visible when you get close.\n\nOverall I can't recommend it for the above reasons as well as two other reasons. One is that it is not worth $14.99 USD and the other is that the dev gave up on it already. Even though people still buy this game, the developer got lazy and the odds of another update, more content, or even just paid DLC are probably zero. I will not be buying another game by this developer, and I will steer anyone away from this game that I can.","April 9, 2015","false","3.3"," 46 of 57 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","46","57","3","0"

Maybe add a difficulty setting other than spawn control in only the sandbox mode?\n-I never used late game equiptment at all, it's not even needed to dive to the deepest part of the ocean and win the game.\n-Once you get to the deeper parts of the ocean, the noise starts getting all buggy and you can't hear enemies anymore as well as other sounds that should be there.\n-There is virtually no late game. The bottom of the ocean is actually easier to survive in than the shallow area you start in. the late game boss enemies don't even attack until provoked.\n-While there are some cool things you can do with building, a small two room base will do you just as good as a massive fancy base.\n**and finally my biggest problem with this game**\n-During adventure mode you earn money to use in the sand box mode for free play. Okay, awesome. However you can only use this money ONCE, for ONE sand box game! After completing the adventure mode and Survival mode with gathering as much money as possible I started a sand box game with everything I wanted :) And then I tried starting another sandbox game, with no money to actually start with anything... So to play sand box and actually have enough money to start with the fun items you have to spend hours in the regular game -_- each time...\n\nSo....\nThere are a lot of things I find annoying with the game play.

This is the pivot that FarSky works on. You are a survivor of a submarine crash and need to survive long enough to retrieve the pieces of your craft and make it to safety.\n\nYou learn to watch your oxygen. Your hunger. Your injuries. Depth. Daylight. Materials. Predators. There's a tight little game here.\n\nUnfortunately the experience is a little shallow. Building your base is fun, but beyond the crafting tables and a small crop of vegetables, there's not a lot to do. Exploration is mandatory and soon enough you get into the gameplay loop of guessing when it's dawn, scooting out to find a little more resources, or travel a little further down. The world is procedurally generated, so that's both fun and frustrating in equal measures.\n\nIt's probably a nice game to play for a weekend. Music is nice and the graphics are at times stunning despite their simplicity.

The gameplay and controls are fairly obvious, nothing obviously counter intuitive or difficult to understand.\n\nThe initial survival mode doesn't take too long to get through. I didn't bother with the second survival mode, but it might be an interesting way to really make the game longer.

They just go straight pretty much.\n\nWhen I was reaching the end of my time with Far Sky, I killed a whale to see if I could.

I also tried to lure a Kraken to the surface. I'm not sure when I lost it, but it followed me pretty high up. So you know, there are some things to do in the end game.

It's not as in-depth as some other survival games on the market, but still offers base building, base defense, mining, crafting, a hunger system, and combat.  Here, you take on the role of Nathan who crashed his submarine and must find his ship parts in order to escape (sort of like "Sir, You Are Being Hunted").  There's a sandbox available and the gold you find in the campaign can be spent equipping your character from the onset.  The ambience is a bit cartoony like "The Long Dark", but still remains beautiful to look at.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whyessew/recommended/286340/","whyessew","MarquisDeSade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whyessew/","13 products in account","I bought FarSky on a whim. I had some extra cash to spare and the concept of the game looked compelling enough for me. Since I've finished the initial "campaign mission"/"adventure mode". I think I'm qualified to review the game.\n\nGRAPHICS (9/10):\n\nI was hooked by the graphics in FarSky. I'm serious, the game looks great. It doesn't sink into the "box/block aesthetic" that most voxel-based sandbox survival games like to fall into. For a game built on Java, it looks pretty fantastic. If there's anything that this game does great it's the graphics. It's appropriately minimalistic when it needs to and appropriately detailed when it needs to. No two landscapes look the same, and while there are certain patterns as to where things appear—these patterns never look too obvious.\n\nWhile textures might fade in and out sometimes—the game's still in a early dev stage and it's probably a problem that will be fixed later in a patch or something.\n\n\nSOUNDTRACK/SOUND EFFECTS (7/10):\n\nThe music does a good job in setting a tone for the game. A good word to describe the soundtrack for the majority of the game is "melancholic". It's peaceful and it's never too distracting.  I would however, hope for more suspenseful tunes for the game during moments where the player is in trouble.\n\nSound effect wise, the game is pretty quiet. Whilst the game itself is understandably quiet (it's set underwater...and sound doesn't travel well), the lack of sound effects make the game sometimes feel boring. I'm not saying that the game should be a smorgashboard of sounds—but it would be nice if we heard the occaisional whale call or maybe the periodical breathing of our main character. Or maybe even a low and steady hum of the drill you use.\n\n\nCONTROLS (8/10):\n\nFarSky's your bog-standard survival/voxel-based game. It handles a lot like MineCraft. I'd say that it does a pretty good job at what it's supposed to do—only for a few issues.\n\n1) In other games of similar nature, you're usually allowed to right click on resources or to split resources the way you want them. In FarSky, you can only fill a certain resource up to the maximum amount and that's it. There are no "resource distribution" controls built in the game and that can be quite frustrating.\n\n2) The swimming mechanics are kind of clunky. And for some reason—you can't crouch! I'm hoping that the "no crouching" problem could be fixed later in DLC.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY (7/10):\n\nFor what it has so far, it's pretty good. I mean, it's fun. And it will definitely kill six hours (that's how long it took me to beat the first "adventure mode") and the game has everything that it's advertised to have. You can build bases underwater, you can mine for resources underwater, you can hunt for fishes...et, cetera. There's nothing missing!\n\nBut while it's everything it's advertised to be, there aren't enough features! I'm hoping that the devs release periodic updates a la Minecraft and allow for modding support, because this game needs more content to kill more than six hours! I'll probably revisit the game sometime later, but the lack of content is kind-of a turnoff. You'd think that a game that focuses heavily on underwater exploration would have more stuff to explore right?\n\n\nOVERALL (7.5/10):\n\nI don't regret purchasing FarSky. But I just want more content. I don't care if the devs don't fix the "no crouching" problem, I just want more music, more sound effects and more gameplay elements.\n\nAs of the time I'm writing this review, this game is on sale—and it's worth the buy right now. That's if the devs add stuff. If they don't add any new features within the next few months following the posting of this review. Don't buy the game. But if you're going to buy the game now, buy it—it's worth it. And at the very least, it will kill 6 hours of your time.\n\n","April 26, 2014","true","6.3"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

It's lovely, the gameplay is fairly smooth, and the ever-present battle against the air tank adds a little suspense, particularly before any upgrades are peformed.\n\nHowever, the game plays like a beta - there is very little content or diversity. I love a good survival/hoarding game, and this should fit the bill perfectly; however, the extremely limited crafting and resources are disappointing.\n\nWhen I purchased this, I thought it was a beta, and I continued to think that until I sat down to write this review and saw the others. It's very sad the devs are done with the game, as it could have a lot more added to it.\n\nThings I like:\n\n* Novel concept and storyline (thought it's far too short)\n* Beautiful, rich, underwater environment\n* Automated defenses, like drones and turrets\n* Extra cargo space with drones\n* Exploration which requires upgrades to complete (though it can all be seen and done within a couple of hours)\n* Increased danger from predators at night\n* Upgradable equipment\n* Automated resource extraction\n* Decent hunger/food system\n* Blood mechanics (blood in the water from injuries or hunting attracts predators)\n* Music and sound effects\n* Decent world topographical map showing major points of interest/resources\n* Decent agricultural system (but it would benefit from more options)\n\nThings I dislike:\n\n* Terrible gravity system - I understand we can't just have the ability to limitlessly ascend, but the current system is infuriatingly limited.\n* Limited crafting - number of possible objects/upgrades is very small.\n* Limited construction - More base options would be nice.\n* Storage chests are far too small and non-stackable.\n* No way to recover items after death - at least none I've found.\n* No way to sleep through the night to fast-forward\n* No way to split stacks in inventory at all - at least none I've found.\n* Some items are ridiculously expensive to craft/consume for the reward.\n* No ability to save the game without quitting.\n\nWhat I would like to see:\n\n* More diverse predators\n* More storyline\n* More biomes to explore\n* More craftable items\n* More and better base construction\n* More discoverable points of interest - different wrecks, caves, et cetera\n* More resource types\n* Less expensive cooking - each item of cooked food takes 1 coal, which can be difficult to find\n\nI got this on sale for less than $5, and it was definitely worth that amount. I might even say it's worth the $14.99 if you're the sort of person who doesn't want a seriously challenging game, and are more in the mood to mindlessly (in a pleasant way) gather resources and live out your life on the ocean floor.\n\nStill, it could be so much more.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WonderGamer/recommended/286340/","WonderGamer","WonderGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WonderGamer/","1744 products in account","Nice little underwater twist that Minecraft players are going to enjoy.  The terrain in the game is smoother, so it's not exactly a voxel game, but rogue-like to be sure.  The only issue is that the developer felt it was necessary to cut development on the game early (I'll give the developer credit for being honest, but a lot of people are not happy about this), so the capabilities of what you can craft in the game is easily lacking when you look at the number of other voxel games on the market.  Because of the lack of content & how short the game is, I wouldn't suggest purchasing at full price, but definitely when on a sale.\n\nA few issues I'm going to note here:\nThe game does not have any means of time tracking as far as I can see, so you can easily get caught out after dark & get pummeled by attacking fish/sharks where you can't move fast enough to dodge or run from them.  If you have a weapon, you can at least defend yourself to a point, but you're still going to get hit considering it takes several spears to take most predators down.\nThere are some areas in the game that you might get stuck on the terrain (happened to me a few times in my base); a simple hop should get you moving again.\nThe game does not remember your resolution settings, so you will need to reset this every time you restart the game.\nThere is no tutorial in the game, so you may end up have to use trial & error & the Steam forums to figure out what you need to do to actually play the game.\nThe crafting requirements are displayed for things you are attempting to craft, but all you get is a small icon with no indication as to what you're looking at.  The crafting menu is simplified similar to Terraria & Starbound, but the lack of ability to find out what each icon is (not to mention some of them look very similar with only a slight color difference; take copper & gold for example), can cause confusion & isn't really helpful.\nOccasionally you'll run into sunken ships, these don't seem to have any effect in the game regardless of being shown on your map.  I would assume an unfinished feature; the only thing I can see that has any relevance to them is you will occasionally find up to 4 item chests strung around them, but with the item chests having their own map makers, there's really no reason in including a ship icon as well with no purpose other than higher probability of these chests.\nOnly a number of resources actually have map icons.  This is understandable when you consider Iron is literally everywhere, but the rarer resources are harder to find & for the most part don't have a map icon.  Dirt, Coal & Gold all have map icons, but for the most part unlimited resources do not (although Dirt & Coal apparently fit under this category).  The first resource you're going to have trouble locating is Copper & considering their is no map icon for it, you may have trouble locating it again when you need Copper as there is no way I can see to set a marker on you map.  There is however another means to do this & that is to drop an Extractor right on top of it.  This not only continues to mine the material while you're away from it, but the Extractor itself has a map icon, making it easier to re-locate it.  My suggestion on this is to always have at least one Extractor on hand so you can mark rare resource locations to come back to later.\nWhile chests with items do have map markers, chests with coins do not.  Coins are used in Sandbox mode to start you off with equipment.  While you are not required to start with equipment in sandbox mode, it does make it a lot easier to deal with.\nDroids could have been better designed.  Once you have activated one, they follow you around as a means of extra storage space for items you pick up.  The problem here is that in order to call a drone to you, you have to first locate them, then press the Activation button while targeting them.  I think a better method for this would have been to use a controller or keybinding, but unfortunately there is no easy method to call them to you.  The plus side to using drones is that any items on the drone do not get dropped if you die; only the items on your own body get dropped when you die.  Drones are a good way to safeguard items you may have found before getting back to your base without having to fear not getting back to your body after a death to retrieve those items; this works EXTREMELY well when it's getting dark & you know you're not going to get back to the base before you start getting attacked.\nThis game still easily makes it on my favorite list; it doesn't really matter if it's a short game or not, rogue-likes give games a high replay value & keeps things interesting.  As far as functionality & user-friendly is concerned, the game is lacking & not extremely easy to learn for those who haven't played voxel games before & as far as crafting is concerned, it probably has the lowest inventory capabilities of any voxel game out there.  Plus some features seem unfinished, so I can't exactly say the game is worth the $15 price tag, but if you can get the game for approximately a third of the price, you're looking at a pretty decent game.","September 8, 2014","true","30.0"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","20","30","0","2"

There's really not much content in terms of crafting and gathering, and you end up getting enough materials and making everything that you can make in the game in 4 hours. Building up your base seems a bit pointless because there really isn't much you can fill your base with, so most of the rooms you make are just empty.\nThe fun in this game is the exploration and the tense fear that you experience when you're traveling in the water at night and theres sharks everywhere, and when you hear the sound of something moving behind you in the water and you look behind you to find a shark about to take your head clean off. But once you get about 4 hours into the game, that feeling dissipates because you have enough materials and the highest level weapon you can make to where you can pretty much 1-2 hit any shark that comes your way.\nI did have a lot of fun with this game though, and the extra survivor mode (which is like hardcore modes in ARPG's where if you die, thats it game over) you get after beating the game is motivation enough to do a second playthrough. I recommend this game because its still a great game despite the lacking content.

I guess it's the ambience feeling, the imagination, etc.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are alright. You can find drones and turn them on to protect you. You can find already built bases or make your own. You can easily find food nearby when you're hungry (i.e. keeping jumping in and out of water for fish to spawn nearby). Each world is randomized as well, so yeah it is open world!\n\nThe cons though is you're crippled at the beginning, so you have to be careful. All you have is a drill at first, which can only be used for material extraction.\n\nAnother con, being the biggest, is there isn't much of a tutorial. You would think bandages could heal you, but they are only used to stop the bleeding. The only way you can replenish health is eating food. You think the drill could at least defend you a bit, but alas it does not. Wait...I need coal to cook?! you didn't tell me that! You mean I can't combine items to cook?! Speargun needs spears?

I thought I accidentally bought an early release title, but it appears that the devs just gave up and released the game the way it is.\n\nIt's a shame really, I think the idea of a minecraftish game in an underwater setting sounded pretty cool. I would like to have seen meaner and tougher enemies as when you dive deeper into the depths of the ocean rather that the slow moving jellyfinsh and friendly squid that only attack when you mess with them. I would have liked to build an underwater base with power generators and defense systems, oxygen tanks starcraft style tech tree stuff. Instead you can add a bunch of rooms to your base or just leave it as a small room, there is no real reason to make your base bigger except to make it look cooler I guess.\n\n","April 26, 2014","false","8.4"," 38 of 65 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","38","65","0","0"

You are Nathan, the survivor of a submarine crash who must learn to withstand the dangers of the ocean while attempting to repair his wrecked submarine and return to the surface world. Sounds easy right?  Think again.\n\nWhere this game really nails it is with the visuals. The seascape is extremely detailed, there’s kelp, seaweed, fish, and the like everywhere. Stingrays gracefully soar by overhead. Schools of many kinds of fish float by, and occasionally a shark will even swim up!\n\nFarsky, in essence, is all about adapting to the oceanic environment. You start with some very basic tools – a drill, a few seeds, and a small base where you can refill your oxygen. You will have to learn to manage your time spent exploring, unless you really enjoy drowning from running out of oxygen. Using your drill, you can collect many types of resources such as iron, copper, and gold, to craft a variety of tools, weapons, and base items. You can expand your base, create a spear gun, grow a farm, hunt fish to eat, explore the depths, etc. There are a lot of things to do!\n\nAt the start, you can only go so deep underwater. As you craft better equipment, you can stay out exploring for longer and go deeper. The deeper you go, the darker and more dangerous it gets, but the rarer resources are found at lower depths! If you go too deep without equipment, your helmet will break and you will drown. Luckily the game has a depth meter in the interface that displays your current depth along with the deepest your current equipment can handle.\n\nFarksy has a Story mode and a Sandbox mode. As you play either mode, you will find small chests of gold coins that you can use to buy starting items for Sandbox mode to give you a head start. Every map is randomly generated as well, creating a new, fresh experience each time you play.\n\nIf you like games such as Minecraft, Terraria, or even Edge of Space, you will enjoy Farsky. Other games have used an underwater setting before, but not like this. This is a fresh new concept, and Farsky has nailed it.\n\nRecommended!\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!\n\nNote - This game was provided by the publisher/deve with the request to write an unbiased, informative review.

Sure you could stay behind and hunt down the ore needed for tier 3 armour and farm resources to create a bigger base but what for? There's no secrets or anything worthy of finding besides the underwhelming kraken and the resources he guards. If you do find yourself exploring you'll soon find there's no penalty to dying making enemies non threatening and the air and food gauge pointless.\n\nOverall it's pretty to look at for 10 minutes but not for £10","May 6, 2015","false","0.9"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"

I usually end up having no clue what to do any dying alot. In FarSky, I had no clue what to do and kept dying alot. But in a good way.\n\nFarSky is a fairly simplistic underwater survival game, in which you are tasked with collecting 9 submarine parts to return to the surface. Easy, right? Wrong.\n\nYou are dropped in an underwater base with nothing but a diving suit and a drill, and you must get to these nine parts by your own means. Collect resources, make better equipment, and delve deeper into the depths of the ocean. FarSky is a really atmosperic game, and with it's easy game mechanics I can easily see myself diving (see wot I did der) into the game's sandbox mode, and just having a good ol' explore of the ocean floor.\n\nHowever, the ocean is no calming retreat. FarSky offers a "hunt or be hunted" type deal, in which you need to hunt for your own food, or get eaten by it. It is quite a challenging experience, but after each death I somehow want to go back and fight off the creature and get my dropped supplies.\n\nHowever, when I found out that this was not an early access game, I was a little dissapointed. The game doesn't offer many game mechanics (for exapmle there are very few things you can craft), much like a game in the beta phase would play like. It's vast ocean playground is it's saving grace, because it's lack of content really does let it down.\n\n+ The game is quite easy to get into after the first half hour or so\n+ The ocean is an atomospheric, and scary, place. FarSky shows that perfectly\n+ Offers a good central goal from the get-go. You don't feel as if you are wandering aimlessly\n\n- I would expect this amount of content from an Early Access game, not a full release.\n- Combat is very shaky. I often died (maybe b/c I suck)\n- Expanding the base is tricky and not very well done (again, maybe b/c I suck)\n\n8/10","April 26, 2014","true","8.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Food is a bigger issue early game and the predator AI is quite simple and predictable once you get to know it. Then as usual you have the crafting part which works pretty much as every other game. There's harder games out there if you're looking for a challenging survival experience. Far Sky falls more on the easy side of the survival genre.\n\nThe ambience is what got me most of the game. The visual style got me from the first moment and I loved diving deeper to more haunting scenery. It also quite translates the loneliness feeling of being underwater.\n\nOn the bad side, I feel like this game would fully blossom with modding capacity and it could have been polished a bit more. But it's still a gem in it's actual (and definitive. The dev has stated a sequel might happen but development on this game is done) state.\n\nSo TL:DR a not fully polished gem that is worth more than meet the eye.","May 17, 2015","true","22.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","1"

Not much of an issue if you're good at timing your knife swings or spear gun shots, but is still a flawed system for a game.\n- The uncontrollable Droid AI can get you into trouble if they shoot and miss a smaller predator such as a frilled shark, but hit a kraken...\n- Certain upgrades/objects are useless like the Overpowered Drill, and the harpoon turret which can actually get predators to attack you even if you just swim by due to hostile creatures' AI. I was in MORE danger than without them.\n- I'm not too bothered by visual things but I'll list some out: Objects can clip into things, e.g. seaweed going through walls and floor of a base, and krakens move right through you while in submarine.","March 28, 2015","false","21.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Basically, it revolves around collecting 10 pieces of a submarine spread about. There are 3 tiers of depths/minerals/equipment. You need the tier 1 minerals found in tier 1 depths to craft the tier 1 equipment that will allow you to reach tier 2 to mine tier 2 to craft tier 2 to reach tier 3. That's it. I've finished the game and Steam says I've played for less than an hour. A considerable chunk of that was wrestling with the unintuitive interface and restarting. The survival mechanics are rendered irrelevant by how abundant food is. All predators behave exactly the same, which means they swim aimlessly about, until they suddenly decide to come charging at you at Mach 4, and you get one second to either shoot them or be treated to the most hilariously bad shriek of pain I've heard in a while.

But if you explore a bit, the game is very worth it.\nSecond, Don't pay attention to people calling this game "minecraft, but underwater". The only thing you can build and customize right now is your base, and even so, there isn't much point in doing so, except to allow for more room for chests. The game also tells you what materials you need to craft items, so it's not much of a mystery, and you don't need a wiki to figure it out.\nThird, gathering materials is very easy. You are given an item that will collect whatever you place it on, for as long as you want it to. Not to mention they don't cost much to build, I found that I had an excess of almost every mineral, and had the best set of equipment, about 40 minutes into the game.\n\nI just finished the game, and I feel it's a bit lacking in content, but I don't regret my purchase as it's likely to get further updates. The music, atmosphere, and visuals are all outstanding, so if you are interested in the ocean and have wanted a nice relaxing underwater game, I'd say this is worth while.","April 27, 2014","true","5.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

What you see is what you get. Which is quite sad, because I myself was under the impression that the game was still in the works when I played it. It just has that sort of feel, that there's plenty to the game but there could have been more.\n\n=The Story= It's, sadly, nothing overly special. Your submarine is busted, and parts of it are scattered across the ocean floor. Some of which are in areas that are far too deep for you to reach without making better equipment. Which is good, as it gives a sort of progression to the game, and therefore makes it so you can't just go getting all the pieces and beating the game right off the bat.\n\n=The Gameplay= It's decent, and puts you in a underwater environment, setting it in a playing field not often explored in a sandbox game. The jumping (Or, swimming) system is decent too, having about seven extra 'jumps' you can take while underwater makes traveling a bit less boring. The combat is alright, so long as you're use harpoons when it comes to predators. Since the predatory fish (Baracudas and sharks, primarily) tend to charge the player, knives won't really work against them. A few good harpoons in the mouth, on the other hand...? Now that'll make them regret coming after you.\n\n=The Crafting= Was... Interesting. But a bit short. With only 3 sets of materials to craft from, it feels pretty lacking. Especially the last equipment set, which only serves to give you a bit more protection than the prior sets of gear instead of letting you delve deeper in to the unknown (unlike the prior sets). Which is a real shame, considering the next part I'd like to touch on.\n\n=The Atmosphere= This aspect of the game was probably my favorite part. The first area of the game seeming pretty bright and lovely, which as you go deeper becomes darker, but lit up with luminescent plants and even glowing fish. Giving the deeper sections of the sea a sort of magical feel, but also makes them feel very foreboding as the denizens of the deep don't take too kindly to you coming in to their home.\n\nAll in all, the game is decent to play, but it's not likely you'll play it much after initially beating it, which takes only a few hours at most. A good game to get when it's on sale, but it's certainly not a good idea to buy at full price. Especially when taking in to consideration you could get quite a few good games that are finished and on sale for the price you could buy this one at full price.\n\nWere the game still in the works, I could recommend it... But it's just too lacking when it comes to being a completed project.","February 11, 2015","false","3.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I bought it on sale for $3, and had played it to comepletion in about 4 hours (give or take an hour I spent just exploring for no reason).\nAs much as I hate to echo everyone else's review, there simply is not enough content to make it worth the original price. It's fun to get to a new level (of which there are currently 3) and explore the flora and fauna, and it's fun to find abandoned bases which you can repurpose for yourself, but that's where the fun ends. The building/crafting is extremely lackluster, the fights are hard to survive, especially when you take into account certain predators which have insane health, and blistering speed. More often than note, your screen will flash red, and you'll spin around to see what attacked you, but more than likely the enemy passed right through you and is now coming at you from the opposite side.\nThe story is pretty weak and straightforward, which really isn't a big deal to me, especially in a crafting game. Your submarine has broken into 9 pieces, which have been scattered across the ocean floor. Find them.\nThe text is pretty iffy in terms of translation. It's usually okay, but there are certain phrases where you know what is being said, but the word they used just doesn't fit right.\nGlitches. Let's talk about glitches. There are A LOT of them. Plant carrot seeds and get carrots, right? No, silly. Plant carrot seeds and get infinite carrot seeds which in turn can be planted to grow more carrot seeds. Remove window to get window? Nope, you remove that window, you're getting floor.\nOh, and have fun fighting 3 krakens for absolutely no reason.\n\nHonestly? 5/10.

It would be a wonderful $10 game.  But it's being sold for $15.  The game engine is great.  The graphics are pretty and smooth.  The crafting aspect is fun.  The survival aspect is fun.  It just doesn't have enough length of play, and it's not early-access where you can expect to get more content later.  The developers have decided that this short game is the finished product.\n\nYou can finish through in about 8 hours of play (or less, depending on skill, but it definitely won't take more than that.  I finished in 4.5 hours first time but that was with constant nonstop play.  If I'd put it down and come back later I suspect it would have taken longer overall as I'd not have kept the player skills as fresh in my head.)\n\nIt also has a sandboxy survival mode which I haven't tried yet, but the main adventure game is a bit short.\n\nDon't get me wrong.  The shortness of play is the only thing about it that's not so great.  Other than the duration, everything else about it is wonderful.  It's defnitely very pretty.  Visually it's great to look at, especially in the late game as you go deeper and see lots of bioluminescent life forms.  It's a bit like minecraft but without the ability to alter the terrain - you just gather things and build stuff to add on top of the terrain, trying to make the necessary equipment to survive the adventure.  (For example you'll have to go down deep to finish, but your starting scuba suit can't go deep enough to get to the lower layers, so you'll have to construct a better scuba suit to be able to finish, as well as making better weaponry to survive the monstrous stuff down deep.)\n\n","September 28, 2014","true","8.3"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","16","27","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/286340/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The very idea of being trapped underwater proves unnerving and indie release FarSky takes that same concept, removes the brief comfort of an underwater city, and emphasizes the survival mechanics. Can the player gather enough supplies and fend off bloodthirsty sharks in an effort to reconstruct a submarine and reach the surface? It sounds like a grueling challenge, but FarSky offers a concise test of endurance. Nevertheless, the game makes up for the lack of longevity with a steady sense of progression and an appropriately exotic environment.\n\nFarSky spends little time on narrative—Nathan crashes in the ocean and must repair his submarine with the help of a friend on the radio. The game takes a few minutes to establish the rudimentary premise and then thrusts players into an enormous ocean, full of both marvelous wonders and deadly threats. The underwater environment itself stands out as one of the game's greatest strengths due to its novel take on the familiar survival formula. Successful games like Don't Starve and Rust also task players with surviving the elements, but oxygen tanks and barracudas aren't on the list of priorities. I found the ocean to be a refreshing change of pace.\n\nPlayers must find nine pieces of Nathan's submarine to repair it and reach the surface. The game centers on two basic but critical skills in order to reach that goal: hunting and gathering. A majority of playtime will be spent gathering materials and resources to craft better equipment, new buildings, and useful weapons to ward off the ocean's most dangerous creatures. Survival games often include a whole slew of potential items to craft, but FarSky focuses on a much smaller number and partially benefits from its restraint. It makes construction decisions easier and allows players to spend more time actually exploring the ocean.\n\nTrust me when I say there's a lot to discover in FarSky's ocean. Mineral deposits, treasure chests, and temporarily broken drones are all waiting to be found, and I felt the game was at its best when it allowed me to explore the sea at greater depths. Eventually the submarine pieces become much harder to obtain and require new equipment to reach, but the reward is twofold. First, the player finds another submarine piece and gets one step closer to beating the game. Second, it shows off the game's biggest surprises. Much like real life, rarer creatures and glowing spectacles exist deeper in the ocean.\n\nBetter materials are also found at greater depths, so take that drill out and get ready to collect some magnesium! That is, until a shark eats your face off—then it's back to square one. Players drop all items upon death, but FarSky shows mercy and pinpoints their location on the map. It's a surprisingly light penalty that hinders the game's challenge. For a game that emphasizes survival, I thought death would be a bigger deal.\n\nNevertheless, being eaten by a giant fish is still annoying and it's at that point the prey becomes the predator, especially when hunger rears its ugly head. Like any normal human being, Nathan can't function on an empty stomach. A great, albeit dangerous, way to collect food is to craft a speargun and start shooting fish. This represents another key part of the game and provides an enjoyable contrast to gathering and construction.\n\nFarSky's journey from ocean to surface is a strong and focused experience, but it also hinders the title's longevity. I appreciate a game with a clear end goal, but I can't imagine myself going back to FarSky often. The game creates randomly generated worlds, but the challenge from one playthrough to the next remains largely the same. Survival mode unlocks upon completing Adventure mode, which results in far more enemies and thus more frustration. FarSky also includes a customizable sandbox, but starting equipment must be purchased with coins found in Adventure mode. It generates incentive to play the game “right” the first time, but I like my sandbox to allow for complete freedom and in turn more insanity.\n\nFew realistic settings are more dangerous and mysterious than the depths of the ocean, and FarSky captures the duality of its environment and capitalizes on it. I was struck most by the underwater atmosphere, but the fundamentally sound-crafting elements and steady progression resulted in a fun time as well. The game may be rough around the edges—especially when one takes a look at its visuals—but it offers a worthwhile survival experience for fans of the genre.","September 15, 2015","true","11.7"," 45 of 83 people (54%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","54","45","83","7","0"

Sadly however, the world of the game may be colorful yet it just doesn't beg for me to go and explore the vast ocean and aquantic lives thriving behind it. Which actually, are not even there to the best extent. There also just isn't much to the game and nothing to do to keep me entertained or coming back to it for more. I got this on a major sale, but at the price point of $15 I don't see a reason to spend that much money on a game that just in the end leaves you feeling incomplete. After a couple hours, a couple minutes even. You become bored with nothing left to do and no reason to return to it.\n\nCollecting materials in the game are like collecting coins that really go towards nothing and serve no major purpose whats so ever. It's just there for you to grab. No story behind this game. No challenge whats  so ever. While it may be a fun time burner there are many more games in my library for me to turn to while i'm craving a survival sandbox adventure, this game just falls short of giving me that complete feeling and there's just to many competitors in this category for this game to hold a strong back bone.\n\nOn the plus side, I have had no problems with the gameplay. Runs smoothly and works fine with no bugs or malfunctions. So if it's on sale, I recommend picking it up and giving it a try. Otherwise.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/supahjames/recommended/286340/","supahjames","TheGreenJacket","http://steamcommunity.com/id/supahjames/","225 products in account","First off, let me begin by saying that I have a deep seated fear of the ocean. Even games like this terrify me. I also love being scared. Not that this is a horror game, mind you. This game terrified me, in a good way. I enjoyed playing it at first. However, as I began to get used to the game and discovered my objective, I began to become less and less satisfied. Overall, it has the feel of a game that is unfinished.\n\nThe premise of the game is this: You are a deep sea diver who's submarine has crashed in the middle of the ocean. Your objective is to find all nine pieces of your submarine and return to the surface. Pretty interesting, at least to me. It took me two days to complete the game. Even with the randomly generated map, I am confident that it would take me only two hours at the most to finish the game again, now that I am aware of what I am doing. Some might pose the question, "Well why don't you take time to enjoy the building and gathering of resources." The game offers no point in doing so. You can build various items, from diving gear to tables and stools. However, this is extremely limited. There are literally two decorative furniture items for indoors. There isn't much else. There's no point in using the chair and stool for asthetic when you can't even create other things. You can make a lamp and a door. Add some glass walls, etc. But that is it. It really lessens the use of the resources. You don't need a bigger house, because there is nothing to put in it. The most I began using the resources for in the end were for ammunition. *SPOILER* I didn't even build the supercharged drill or whatever the name of the device was. There was no point. I cannot stress enough how little there was to do. And collecting the submarine pieces may seem like a bit of a challenge, but the map literally tells you where they all are.\n\nWhen the download began, it only took about three minutes, so I didn't expect much in terms of graphics. But when I entered the game I was surprised. It was beautiful. It was so calm and serene to watch the manta rays swimming above me, to hear the whales echoing in the distance, and terrifying to watch the tail of a shark jet out into the fog. There was a handful of different creatures for me to meet, and feast upon, and it all moved so beautifully. The simplicity of the graphics simply seemed to credit the beauty. That's why I am so disappointed in everything else. I really wish they had worked a little harder on this. From what I recall there was quite a bit of hype when this game first appeared, but it seems the creator just shelled this out in all the excitement. Overall, I wouldn't reccomend it for the price it is at. It'd probably be a good game for children to play as, for them, it would be a bit more complicated and hard.Otherwise, don't get it.\n\nFun 3/5, Originality 2/5, Graphics 4/5, Maturity 3/5, Worth the price? 2/5 (I give a two instead of a one due to the quick download and interesting graphics)","June 2","false","5.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

However it is     questionable whether the amount of content in the game is worth $14.99.\nBeing able to 'cheese' the game doesn't help the lack of content either. 9 submarine pieces you have to collect are marked on the map and there aren't much in your way to collect them other than the water pressure and day night cycle.

The graphics and music will captivate you as you explore the randomly generated underwater world. The art style is adorable and the explorative gameplay and struggle to survive will keep you playing... For about two hours. Once you work out how the game works, it becomes way too easy. Once you've gone to the deepest depths, you've pretty much seen it all. Late game content serves no other purpose than to allow you to kill stuff faster and explore more of the map without you needing to return back to base.\nBase-building is simple, but it works for and against the game as there could have been much more complexity to keep the players entertained, but the simplicity of it keeps the player out exploring than holed up in their base.\nEnemy variety is bland; each has differing stats but more or less have the same attack pattern/behaviour, which does not provide a challenge at all.\nI could go on, but basically this game lacks content that would make a great sandbox game. Unlike games like say Minecraft, there's not really much reason to stay and keep acquiring resources and build an extensive underwater base because there's not much of a point.\n\nHowever, the simplicity of the game is also it's strong point. It's a minimal game with quite attractive graphics whose gameplay is worth returning to once in a while to burn an hour or two. Your first time playing this game will be the best experience you'll have of this game ever. After that, well, I guess it's up to you. Personally I found myself making up random backstories and giving myself mini challenges to keep the gameplay from getting too stale.\n\nThis game had a lot of potential, and I wish there could have at least been some mods for this game to add to the lacking content.

Disturbingly so.\n\nThat being said, it is not without flaws. In Sandbox mode, specifically, there is a chance that you will find yourself on the only peak at a depth that you can handle, and thus not be able to go deeper to get the resources to build a better suit. There is also a lack of diversity in both the wildlife and the surrounding environment (yeah, it's under the ocean, but it's insanely diverse down there!).\n\nOn the bright side (I love this game, remember?) building is fun! So is hunting. The underlying systems (hunting or growing food to satiate your hunger, building better suits to go deeper, mining for resources to add to your base or build the items you need) is wonderful and addictive. The music is lovely and, despite the flaws, the environment is both colorful and reactive to your presence.\n\nAll in all, I would give this an 8 out of 10; a good game, particularly for early access.

Main game lasts about 2 hours then you unlock survival mode which is one life/tougher enemies. There's also a sandbox mode that lets you buy items with money you find in single player, as well as using the established crafting system. The game itself and its mechanics are pretty fun in the vein of "minecraft" you get iron gear to mine copper at the next level then use copper to mine deeper and so forth, but after copper there’s only one more level and then its endgame. I would love to see bigger enemies and the greater depths actually used, dived down past 350 hoping to see a megalodon or something, but nada. Would also love for it to be darker, much much darker at lower depths and at night making use of the lights you can build and making the night and lower depths much more horrifying and dangerous.

So today I played it and I have to say the positives FarOutweigh the negatives.\nI've only played two hours so far, about an hour and a half in the regular mode and half an hour in sandbox and it has really been an interesting game. The crafting chain is fairly simple and expanding your base is as well. Extractors are extremely useful in speeding up production if it's one of the first things you make.\n\nLadders and cliffs are my main negative notes, getting into base can be tedious and mean death depending if it's nighttime (as I found out when a shark attacked me with very little health b/c of hunger) and I very nearly ragequitted at having to swim back up cliffs. (Having gotten stuck for 10 minutes, and then running out of oxygen)\n\nOverall, negative points aside, it is a very interesting game, that I could potentially spend at least a dozen more hours playing.

Most sandbox games go on forever with no real point to them but there is an "ultimate goal" in FarSky: To rebuild your broken submarine and get back to the surface. It's funny to say but that part of the game  reminds me of ToeJam & Earl for the Sega Genesis.\n\nThere's peaceful music and visuals. Most creatures are passive unless blood is spilled nearby or it's night. Build up your own base or do like I did and take up residence in an abandoned base. After they're repaired and drained of water, they usually become more space than I personally need.\n\nThe downside is that the game is considered "finished" by its developer and if you experience any bugs, you're out of luck on that front. I've run into issues with collision that have made me a bit more careful in how I approach ladders/hillsides but some real tweaks there would have been nice. More than once my swimming drone has gone through the base's walls, leaving trails of bubbles in a room/corridor. It's also a bit irritating that using the underwater scooter doesn't make you fast enough to outrun the deadly night predators that will be gnawing at your flesh if you stay out too late.\n\nWith so many materials to harvest and such interesting areas to explore, I am a little disappointed that more work won't go into it. There's only basic furniture in the way of workbenches, tables and chairs to decorate your living space. I've found sunken ships half-buried in the sand but there's no way to enter them and they seem to serve no other purpose than decoration/a map marker for treasure chests. The story is also basic and doesn't really give you any true reason of why you went down there in the first place.\n\nI do love that you can use extractors to do the mining work for you while you keep exploring, and that they're retrievable so you don't have to keep making them over and over again. Hunger is a persistent mechanic but fortunately you can grow veggies in self-tending gardens--just remember to cook them for the maximum effect. You also get a lot of options for defending yourself: Weapons, drones and harpoon cannons (they're like automated turrets).\n\nI got my copy during the 2015 Steam Summer Sale and I recommend waiting for a sale to pick this up. It is fun but since the developer has admitted to having no more interest in its upkeep, a sale is the best way to feel like you got your money's worth out of a potentially short game.","June 27, 2015","true","12.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neon_cacti/recommended/286340/","neon_cacti","feed the flies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neon_cacti/","382 products in account","FarSky is a survival game where the main character is cast into the ocean depths after his submarine got destroyed. Your goal is to find all the submarine pieces or succumb to your death. As any survival game, FarSky has a hunger bar and instead of the thirst bar it has an Oxygen bar. Scattered around the bottom of the ocean are the parts for you submarine, but also random droids, dirt patches, coal patches that look like oil and chests filled with items or gold coins. To survive you will either have to farm plants or hunt of fish while upgrading your base and equipment. My experience so far was pretty negative. It feels like an undeveloped game, as if it is still Early Access and since it was published it didn't get a single update. Overall it is all very unintuitive. The hammer tool makes no sense and it took me 10 minutes to realize that somehow I removed the roof block of my house and not something else, so building is bad unless you don't mind doing mistakes and not fixing them. There is no clock and you will have little warning of when it turns to night time, the first time it happened I died. All the warning I got was "It's getting dark" and it got dark and I was eaten alive. The crafting system is pretty bad and a lot of the times you will accidentally craft something you don't need because all it takes is one press of a button, then you can delete the item as it serves no purpose. The game also doesn't feature a save button, but instead a "Save and Quit", so if you're scared of it crashing like it did for me you will have to constantly quit the game to the main menu. Another thing I want to add that so far I have no idea what the gold coins are for, perhaps for the final score? Many of the things are left unexplained and are random. Overall the game feels pretty barren.\n\n>I'd give it a 6/10. Cool concept, poorly executed\n>Pros: The graphics are pretty nice, interesting concept, offers several game-modes, tight controls.\n>Cons: Bugs, crashes, can't kill anything unless you got a Knife or other weapon(drills won't do anything), poor combat/crafting/building systems, not many explanations, no way to save the game without quitting, bad day/night cycle and you've got nothing to do while it's night time.\n\nEDIT: The game now stopped counting my playtime, and when I play it I am "Online" rather than in-game.","May 2, 2015","false","2.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coid/recommended/286340/","Coid","Catscratch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coid/","507 products in account","FarSky is an explorative survival game about crashing into the ocean and having to scavenge supplies and discover/upgrade bases in order to salvage & restore your Submarine to working condition & return back to the surface to be rescued.\nThe game is entirely Java-based from the launcher to the engine itself which while easy on the system and runs well at most low-end rigs but is riddled with bugginess. On top of mouse oddities (which are not specific to anything but include slight omuse lag, priority issues with the window and general responsiveness), there is the issue that the game never retains the settings you select for it and will reset to a Fullscreen 1024x768 resolution. You have to click 'Windowed Mode' in the settings literally every time you open it to play.\n\nLet me start with the bad stuff so as to not get you hype and then kill your hype, and instead let you decide if you want to push past these issues to enjoy the game, which is still an easily-enjoyed one.\nThe map system in FarSky is a bit odd in the sense that it only lets you see a certain area quickly on your mini-map, having to instead open the map up fully to review everywhere you've been. The overall map is shrouded in darkness until you visit each area, with a small splotch of what you've physically visited being retained. Furthermore, it uses a topographical system that somewhat tells you the depth of each location due to the pressure system the game has. The lower an area is the better equipment you'll need to traverse it.\nAnother issue is the slow trek of the game. Despite the movement system being something you can get used to (the walk speed is incredibly slow and encourages you to use your 5 'jumps' that are quicker instead) you'll quite possibly find yourself feeling like you're moving around the game at a slow pace. Later on in the game you can make a sort of underwater jet-ski to go quicker but it's still quite tedious. On top of this, you realise that getting all 9 of the pieces to your Submarine is the same repetitive task akin to Sir, You are Being Hunted, except the skill and strategy doesn't change. It's just do-this-9-times with no added mechanics or difficulty besides at the very end the last enemy faced which is hardly difficult.\nIn fact, the game, after you get the spear gun and a couple dozen spears (which is the ranged weapon you use), the game becomes incredibly easy. The enemy AI is a very, very simple and linear sort. If a hostile enemy sees you then it swims slightly away, turns around and charges straight at you. If it hits you, it repeats the process. However, if you shoot any of the fish/creatures that are charging, they get slowed down a bit and lose aggro to repeat the swim-then-charge-you process. If you just stand still and move slowly backwards you can easily take on literally every enemy in the game and hardly ever get hit.\n\nOn the bright side, though, the game accomplishes exactly what its creator intended it to be: A simple exploration game showcasing the beauty of the ocean. It's nowhere near as beautiful as say GTA V or even Half-Life 2 but it's more a serene, artistic, and appreciative beauty. Possibly the intended result of the game's simplistic and relatively casual combat system, the atmosphere of roaming the ocean floor and harvesting plants and minerals is somewhat relaxing due to the lacklustre amount of danger you have to worry about. Furthermore, the bountiful amount of resources you have allows you to build a pretty respectable base that one can be proud of in the game and even allow you to grow your own fruits/vegetables a little bit into the game's progression.\n\nOverall, I'd say for $15 the game is a bit pricey but if you can get the game on sale for $10 or less you won't be disappointed really. In fact, if you compare the price of games to movies in the sense that 'video games should give twice the amount of time a movie runs in gameplay hours for the same price', then it's pretty fair still. I finished the game (playing casually and somewhat exploring) in about 6 hours. I probably could have finished the entire game in three if I bothered to just complete it and I also received the game as part of a Humble Bundle so my previous movie-to-game pricing is irrelevant there.\nIt's not the best game out there but if you're a fan of survival games, then it's pretty good. It's like a smaller mix of Sir, You are Being Hunted and what Subnautica seems like (at the time of typing this review I have yet to play it) so if either of those games catch your fancy, it definitely is at least worth looking into. Definitely pick it up as part of a bundle or catch it at 50% off or more if you see it. I give it about a 7/10 I suppose.","August 29, 2015","true","10.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's pretty unique in this genre and although the game is pretty short, it's a good and fun one.\n\nThe game tells the story of Nathan, who had his submarine broken in the middle of the sea.\nAnd now he needs to survive the depth of the sea by eating, building bases and fighting dangerous creatures\n\nYou have to build bases underwater where you can refill your oxygen tank, plant/harvest seeds/food, craft weapons and develop items.\n\nWeapons are very limited, you can have a combat knife and a harpoon gun with different types of arrows.\n\nYour most useful item is your Drill, with it you can loot minerals and craft items and base parts with these. And these minerals can be found at different locations and their rarity depends on the type.\n\nYou can also use extractors and place wherever you like to drill minerals so fast.\n\nThroughout the sea you will encounter many different fishes and when killed, you can cook their meat for health and reduce hunger. Your enemies here are Sharks, Swordfish, Anglerfish and other dangerous marine creatures, plus there are Krakens too guarding super rare Crystals.\n\nAs for the objective of the Adventure Mode, You need to find 9 parts spread in different direction in the deep to fix your submarine and go back to your home.\n\nThese parts locations sometimes bring challenge, as they are all placed in location with high number of hostile creatures.\n\nAnd there is a Sandbox mode and Survival mode beside the Main Adventure one.\n\nGraphics are colorful and nice, but the textures are extremely pixelated.\n\nAnd by the way, the game runs on Java, if you don't know what that means or never played Minecraft, it means the game might runs slowly and needs a quite good PC to run smoothly, or turn off the graphics settings to the optimal performance.\n\nLastly, I recommend this game on sale, since it's very short and might gets old or boring when you craft the best items.\n\nSo get it on sale if you are interesting in Underwater Minecraft-like game!","April 25","true","2.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whislter/recommended/286340/","whislter","Whistler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whislter/","458 products in account","Likened to Mojang’s popular Minecraft series;\nFarsky tells the tale of Nathan, who on a routine submarine mission is stranded in the ocean after the submarine mysteriously crashes and forcing Nathan (the player) to utilize the vast seabed’s resources with nothing more than a diving suit and a small base to survive.\n\nFarSky’s main game mode involves a combination of gathering resources, building then upgrading your base and equipment, crafting essentials, and exploring the depths of the ocean while searching for the parts of your submarine, fish hunting and fending off against various hungry predators.\nWhere FarSky steers away from the usual Minecraft-esque/survival titles is that FS focuses more on exploring the vast randomly generated world rather than building your own structures, which I feel is a welcome sight.\n\nWhile visuals are by no means made to a AAA standard and are rough around the edges; they are far more pleasing than most of the block based survival titles and if one were to dive deeper (pun not intended), they will find that FS’s world paints a very colourful and atmosphere enriching experience where you will often find yourself stopping or wandering off the beaten path to stand in awe at the many sights there are to offer. A nice change from the usual open land environment, the game capitalizes on every primal awe and fear that the ocean conjures with its alien setting full of wonder, mystery and danger.\n\nWhile somewhat lacking in content, FS’ smaller scope is far easier to grasp allowing the player to spend more time exploring rather than trying to understand a complex crafting system.\nThe limitations set also create a balanced steady progression as to delve to deeper depths which in turn gains access more valuable materials (and bigger hunts) the player will need to craft better diving equipment (the helmet increases pressure resistance, suit bolsters defence, and the oxygen tank allows you to be submerged for longer). While granted having the clear goal of collecting the nine pieces of the submarine cuts a lot of the games potential longevity, I prefer it as unlike titles like Don’t Starve, having an actual goal to work towards makes the gameplay all the more rewarding and less of a ‘free fall’ experience.\n\nAs mentioned exploration is the game’s strong suite, and while combat is relatively simple it is incredibly enjoyable and enhances the atmosphere. Quickly the player learns the fastest way to cure their hunger needs is to hunt their aquatic neighbours, however while this quickly gains a food source it also alerts various ‘big catches’ your way including hammerheads, great whites and angelfish amongst other bigger threats who will tirelessly take a big at you (which in turn attracts more).\nThe risk vs reward of exploring offers a regular dose of adrenaline as you delve deeper and deeper while avoiding or fighting some of the sea’s deadliest hunters which is a welcome experience.\n\nWhile FarSky falls short in content and longevity, FarSky offers a very rich and unique experience that survival genre enthusiasts will not be disappointed. While the game is considered finished, if FarSky Interactive were to add more content (paid or otherwise) I could see FarSky easily managing a longer lifecycle which is definitely worth a look in its current state.\n\nPros:\nAmazing atmosphere,\nEnjoyable exploration,\nBalanced progression.\nEasy to grasp.\n\nCons:\nShort length,\nSmall amount of crafting,\nRough around the edges visuals.\n\nWritten by,\nWhistler\n\nEnjoy the review?\nCome check our my other reviews @ http://morbidplay.com/ for both retro and modern day gaming reviews\n","May 31, 2014","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Basic idea: underwater survival game.  Your goal is to survive long enough to repair your submarine, and then take it back up to the surface.  Once you beat it, you unlock Survival mode, which increases the number of predators, removes the map markers for the submarine parts (so you quite literally may have to scout the ENTIRE map to find the last piece, as I experienced today.  Seriously, there was nothing left in the entire map to uncover when I finally found it on the precipice of the lowest cliff you can safely get to.) and it only gives you one life.  No respawning and looting your corpse this time, fellas.  If you die, you lose.  The crafting is limited, the building could use some work, but all in all, a very fun (if somewhat frustrating at times) game that you should play.","April 29, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls are also very simple and easy to remember so that shouldn't be much of a problem.\n\nThe only downside to this game at this current time is the fact that it has no multiplayer. With multiplayer would come a whole range of different ideas and would allow for people to play with friends and survive with other people.","April 27, 2014","true","102.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a totally different genre (Underwater survival!) and it looks terrific! It's also very relaxing with the underwater swimming, water sounds and great music... well until you get munched on by a hungry shark or barracuda!\n\nAdventure mode is about a 4-6 hour tutorial mission that will teach you the basics of the map, biomes, materials and crafting. It's fairly easy and fun. Then there's "Survival" mode which is unlocked when you complete Adventure mode. It's more like Minecraft hardcore mode - you only get one life and the predators are much more numerous. Lastly, there's Sandbox mode which is straightforward play how you want with the settings you want but unlike creative mode in Minecraft, you can still have predators attacking and you still have to maintain hunger and air consumption to survive so it's a hybrid of creative and survival mode in other games. You do not have to reconstruct your sub in sandbox mode and if you've collected gold from treasure in the other modes, you can spend it on stuff before you start out Sandbox mode, including a sub if you want for enough gold.\n\nThis game could use a lot more content like additional building modules - you currently only get floor pieces and glass wall pieces to expand your underwater base. And it could use some more furniture and decor items for those who really like to construct diverse bases. For the adventurer types, they could add another mission level and some more exploration like underwater cavern systems and this game would be almost perfect. I could even see future DLC being colonization and city construction with NPCs!\n\nBut for what it is now, a very nice little Indie game - definitely worth the 15 bucks for a fun, relaxing underwater survival sim!\n\nDefinitely recommended.","July 21, 2014","true","28.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yolodomo/recommended/286340/","yolodomo","Domo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yolodomo/","623 products in account","Okay, first off, I didn't pay $14.99 for this game. It only cost $1 on Humble Bundle currently (you get this, along with 2 other games for $1). Considering what I saw on the trailer, and the price of $1, and now that I got to play the game and actually completed Adventerer mode in slightly under 2 hours (said clear time was like an hour and 3 minutes, dunno why my play time says 2 hours, probably took me 3 minutes to mess with settings, check stuff on the title screen, then start the game). In any case, onto the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n\n1. To me, I find this to be quite intriguing and original. At first glance I thought it was Minecraft underwater, but not quite as much, as gathering materials doesn't remove blocks, so in a sense, you can't dig yourself to hell or anything like that if you're a digger.\n\n2. It felt immersive and relaxing, quite a pretty game I must say. Not the "best" graphics in the world, but pleasant enough. I can only imagine how something like this would look with the Unreal engine...\n\n3. Unlike most games, at least this one had somewhat of a story (not a fantastic story, but at least it's there), which gives you a sort of purpose to continue to reach the end goal which is to repair your submarine so you can go home.\n\nAnd now...\n\nCons:\n\n1. Not much variety or complexity in equipment you can get. I managed to get the best diving gear quite easily after awhile (never did get the Overpowered Drill as I didn't find enough Crystal). However, that is one of the few problems is that it was fairly easy to get just about everything you needed to succeed, not much challenge really.\n\n2. Enemy AI is predictable. At first, shark got me off guard, I then pulled out my Spear gun and was aiming at it, watching its movement. I noticed it'll swim away a few feet, then turn around and charge directly at you. One spear shot to the shark (doesn't matter where you hit it) will deal damage and cause it to stop charging. For cautious players, wash, rinse, repeat. For those with good aim, you may be able to hit it a few more times as it swims away, preparing for another charge.\n\n3. NO MULTIPLAYER!? WHY!?!?!?\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nThere you have it. It's a short single player game if you decide you wanna play Adventurer mode. Probably endless gameplay with Sandbox mode, haven't tried it yet. As for enemies, sharks aren't the only ones in the game, as there are many other oceanic creatures you will discover, who's AI may seem abit better than the shark, but still able to easily get by them. My only disappointment is how little there is in the way of crafting, materials, building, etc. There just isn't much to play with. This game has sooo much potential to be better, loads of potential. It feels as though it's unfinished in a way, however.\n\nWould I recommend?\n\nConsidering I paid only a dollar on Humble Bundle (that's $1 USD) for this and 2 other games, then yes. It's worth at least a buck for a decent enjoyable game with a pretty atmosphere. Would I recommend at the $14.99 price however? ABSOLUTELY NOT! Either catch this game on sale, or don't buy it at all.\n\n(Since I can't choose both Thumbs Up and Thumbs Down, I'm giving it a Thumbs Up cause I paid $1 for it! Thumbs Down if you paid $14.99 for it)\n\n*EDIT as of 7/24/2015* Okay, watched a trailer of Subnautica. It looks similar to FarSky except for the fact that is looks FAR MORE developed and has a much larger underwater world of exploration, as well as more things to build, craft, gather, etc. Graphics look amazing, and it's only $19.99. Comparing Subnautica to FarSky's price of $14.99, I'd say spend that extra $5, and get Subnautica. I got lucky in getting FarSky at least for a $1 while it was on Humble Bundle one time. No way is it worth $14.99 though.","May 2, 2015","false","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is just the wonderment of knowing that you can swim with whales, fight Krakens and even defend yourself against different types of sharks including Hammerhead, Great White, and many more if you are able to catch them! If you are not sure you want a game where you can build up on your base, make a submarine, mine ores, build a farm in your base and go to the greatest depths of the ocean floor to fight off Krankens to take their bejewled Crystals, then you can just stop reading and probably go play something you most fancy.

As a diver whos submarine just crashed and its components scattered around a procedurally generated underwater landscape you are to recover the lost components and rebuild said submarine.\n\nBefore you do, however, you need to find shelter in abandoned seabed stations (and build more, modify, repair or destroy them, they are concidered yours), grow or hunt (or be hunted) for food and mine for minerals. One should also keep an eye on the depth and air meter, as the diving equipment worn is limiting max depth, breathing time, and armor.\n\nThe sealife is interactive in that it tries to swim away if its frightened by you, ignores you if it doesn't concider you a threat or hunts for you if it does or you are leaking bodily fluids that simply attract predators.\n\nOne of the even more interesting points is that you will find underwater stations that have been damaged. When you are close enough the engine kicks in and starts flooding these stations. Repairing them will reverse the damage but will cost you some iron. As of yet I have not actually seen a base being damaged, but I suspect that the squids or sharks will pound a station if a hunted player enters them for shelter.\n\nAs this game is still in active development I have high hopes.

I got everything unlocked was having a good time exploring and trying to open the map all the way and get all the pieces to the sub. 1 bad part of this game is that if you alt tab it for any reason you have to right click it and close it and it don't save the progress when you close it. other than that small thing the game is loads of fun and I will be starting it over because it's that much fun. No Achievements no trading cards but it's a lot of fun and I would recommend it to anyone who likes adventrue and exciting gameplay. I have built over 50 Auto turrets and had 6 bases that i had protected from the Giant Kraken, when I'm low on air and running from them my turrets take care of them so they don't damage my base. I really wished this was co op or Multiplayer because this game could be really fun to play with another person. the first thing you have to do is get food once you get that your in for a real treat. Go deeper push the limits build bases explore and have fun. I now have 10 bases on each corner of the ocean floor and I use the submarine to get to them faster. Soon I will have the entire Ocean floor mapped out and possibly closer to finishing the game, I did however unlock Survivor mode did my save after I found the last part to the Submarine and now I play with it instead of going to the surface to start a new game. I would highly recommend saving every hour if you could so you don't lose anything if you accidentally Alt tab the game.

As somebody who is deathly fearful of the ocean, my first hour in the game was spent on my toes with my heart racing. Then I started to ease into the experience. The calming music, the awe inspiring imagery, and the sensation of being safe washing over you every time you step into your base. Out of the 3 and a half hours it took for me to beat the first mode of the game, I wasn't bored for a single second.\n\nThis game brings out real, powerful emotions in me. The surge of panic when you hear rushing water around you and know that a predator is about to make contact with you. The gut wrenching feeling when you jump over a cliff and careen downwards into an entirely new ecosystem in the depths below. And the awe and wonder the first time I heard the singing of a whale and turned around to see it floating by directly over me.\n\nThe experience was short, but it was incredibly solid and memorable. I sincerely hope that a FarSky 2 comes out with more building options for your base and longer scenarios.\n\nI do not believe the game is worth the asking price of $14.99, but I got my copy in a bundle at an extremely low price. I'm sure it will go on sale for much cheaper from time to time as well. The game simply does not have enough raw content to warrant such a high price, but the experience is well worth getting it on sale.","July 23, 2015","true","3.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Eğer bilgisayarınızda ekran kartınız veya Java güncel değilse oyun çöker hatta daha baştan açılmaz. (64bit Windows için ayrıca 64bit Java indirmeniz bile gerekebilir) Gerekli linkleri, oyunun topluluk konu başlıkları içerisinde  Yapımcının açtığı sabit bir konuda detaylı bir biçimde bulabilrisiniz.\nOyunun kendisine gelecek olursak en kabacasından su altnda basit bir Minecraft olarak düşünebilirsiniz. Daha derinlerde daha değerli madenler vardır, ve o derinliklere inebilmek için dalış kostümünüzü geliştirmeniz gerekir. (Kask, zırh ve dalış tüpü, basit olduğunu söylemiştim) Bu oyunu indirirken aşırı detaylı öyle aman aman birşey beklemeyin, normal ''Aaa bu ne, aaa şu ne.'' diye diye oynasanız bile max 4-5 saate hikaye modunu bitirebileceğiniz bir oyundur, yine de her ne kadar basit olsada, tam bir göz zevkidir, rengarenk minaraller, bitkiler ve mercanlar, sayıları ve çeşitleri az dır, ama birleşince 4 saat oynayıp silebileceğiniz bir oyun için oldukça güzel bir atmosfer oluştururlar. Oyun dediğim gibi su altında geçtiği için Ay'ın yüzeyindeki gibi devasa zıplamalar ile haraket ederek yol alırsınız bu oyunda, ama dikkat edin oksijen tüpü sınırlıdır ve üssünüze dönmeniz gerekir. (Başlangıçta sizlere aktif ve minik bir üs(base) verilir, ancak harita üzerinde onarabileceğiniz çok daha büyükleride vardır, ayrıca kendi üssünüzü inşa edip büyütebilirsiniz.) Sandbox modu da vardır ve adından da anlaşılacağı gibi gez dolaş tarzındadır. Hikaye kısmına gelecek olursak, denizaltınız parçalanır, ve deniz tabanına düşersiniz, göreviniz haritada dağılmış olan 9 denizaltı parçasını toplayıp yeniden yüzeye çıkabilmektir.\nNot: Arkaplan müzikleri oldukça hoş.","August 29, 2015","true","4.4"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","9","17","5","6"

Hunting Fish is also something you'll do, either with your knife or speargun while avoding predators like sharks (that do get attracked by the blood clouds) or if you prefer a more vegetarian approach you can also plant crops in little plant pots.\nBut while all that is fine and dandy, FarSky puts a much larger emphasis on the exploration of the Deep Sea environment.\n\nThe exploration part is where the game really shows of it's true beauty, finding the pieces of your submarine is one thing but to just swim around the ocean floor and finding that very first 150+ Meter drop into the darker depths below is a completly different thing altogether or even if it's just you running into your first Whale, listening to it's distinct cry as you swim right next to it.\n\nThere are alot of beautiful moments like that in this game, which are helped along tremendously by the games soundtrack composed by Artist [ Lapse ], it's for the most part a very minimal and peaceful soundtrack that focuses on the "sense of wonder" and doesn't try to be too in-your-face about it, but it does have some more suspense heavy tracks that play during sections where you are in deeper water or out at night.\n\nNow the game does have one major flaw, which is it's length clocking in at about 6-7 hours for my first playthrough, where i really took in all the games atmosphere and build up my base all nice & proper.\nOfcourse, some people have reportedly finished the game in 1-3 hours which i honestly blame on the default difficulty "Adventurer", which marks all the pieces of the damaged submarine on your map from the start of the game, it removes alot of the exploration aspect of the game.\nIn contrast to that the "Survivor" Difficulty that you unlock after beating the game on "Adventurer" has no map markers for the submarines pieces unless you are right untop of them, oh and it's one life only, which i honestly think is the Difficulty the game should be played on even for a first time playthrough since it adds that much needed tension.\n\nSo, whould i recommend this game? Hell yes i would, eventho this is more of a "one time experience" rather then a game you'll play for hundreds of hours like Minecraft or Terraria, because it honestly doesn't have nearly as much content to offer then those but i still think this game is worth playing just for the experience it offers.\n\nAnd hey, if it's not worth 10 bucks to you, you can always wait for a steam sale.","January 8","true","14.2"," 22 of 43 people (51%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","51","22","43","4","0"

Problem is this seems to have fallen into abandonment and in the forsaken land of quick money grabs. The system is solid everything is smooth. Sadly once you understand how to play you can get to the end of this system in under 45 minutes, yes, in hardcore survival mode.\nDepth meter would make you believe you can go a lot deeper but this is limited to 3 explorable layers, arguably I would have liked to see at least 10 explorable layers to consider this a complete experience. As it is right now it is sadly anti-climatic.\n\nYes I understand this is a single dev working on it and no it doesn't mean I should proportionally lower my expectations. Everything was put in place for me to thouroughly enjoy the first 3 layers, adding a bit more depth would have been a small extra step to take and would have meant couple more layers, couple more material dependencies before going down, more crafting, stronger enemies. Hell i wouldn't even mind having the same enemy in different colors and stronger in a WoW type of fashion, I just wanted a bit more.

Why would you be content eating peanuts when you could have gone the extra step that would make you able to afford a peanut plantation ?\n\nI'm sorry FarSky Interactive, I really really enjoyed the game it was very engaging experience.

I wanted to give a really positive review but in retrospect, theres no way for me to do that either.\n\nI'm sitting here hoping that someday i can come back to it and resume my exploration of the depth with some more engageing content but I feel like all i can expect is some more disappointment.\n\ntl:dr : Great system, total immersion.

It's pretty, easy, and relaxing. That being said the game is marketed as a Survival/Adventure game which should not be easy or relaxing. I made it threw both game modes without a single death, resources are so plentiful that you will never want for anything, and in most cases I beat the game without using the top tier equipment.\n\nOne concept that I liked was in order to mine one of the more rare resources you had to kill the giant squids that were protecting it. This was itroduced half way threw the game and is a fun miniboss battle. What was dissapointing was  that the squids are the hardest enemies, and there is no actuall "boss" in the game. Being able to kill the stongest enemies with early game equipment is not caracteristic of the Survival game genre.\n\nFor something that is supposed to be a Survival/Adventure game it feels like an early access game instead of a final product.

It's pretty, easy, and relaxing. That being said the game is marketed as a Survival/Adventure game which should not be easy or relaxing. I made it threw both game modes without a single death, resources are so plentiful that you will never want for anything, and in most cases I beat the game without using the top tier equipment.\n\nOne concept that I liked was in order to mine one of the more rare resources you had to kill the giant squids that were protecting it. This was itroduced half way threw the game and is a fun miniboss battle. What was dissapointing was  that the squids are the hardest enemies, and there is no actuall "boss" in the game. Being able to kill the stongest enemies with early game equipment is not caracteristic of the Survival game genre.\n\nFor something that is supposed to be a Survival/Adventure game it feels like an early access game instead of a final product. As a casual game, however, it feels just right.","June 26, 2014","true","3.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There's lost of other bugs in this game, like sharks spawning out of nowhere next to you and killing you in one bite, bugs in crafting and so on. Feels like an Early Access pushed out because the developer got bored or something.\n\n\nSecondly, the whole concept if this game is ridiculous and perverted. I wanted to say that the author has no understanding of even the simplest concept of school-level physics, but it is much more worse - they do not even understand how water and swimming works, least of all, how swimming under the water might be working.\n\nThe whole game is based on the premise that the protagonist's submarine is broken (in pieces, no less) and so they are stuck underwater, because they cannot JUMP high enough to reach the surface! So we have to craft a base to survive underwater and actually go DEEPER to gather pieces of the broken up submarine, so it can bring us back up and above. Because, I repeat, when you are deep underwater, you can only walk and jump and hold that electrical thing that moves you fast. But it can't move you to the surface either. Not to mention that we're walking and jumping at depths that would be completely rid of color and light, and not survivable by a human on it's own, but that just some geek details, right?\n\nMaybe I am so picky about this because I have over 40 dives logged, but with all the bugs this is beyond ridiculous.\n","December 6, 2015","false","3.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

Sandbox should be Creative where you have unlimited supplies to work with.\n\nSUGGESTIONS\n---------------\n* Farming is extremely OP, within 30 minutes of starting the game(I played through twice) I had enough potatoes to last me a long time, suggest dropping the number of harvested potatoes from 3 to 2.\n* At least double the health and damage of enemies of the lowest point(250m+) and make them aggressive towards the player at all times(aside from the kraken), at 250+ meters itll be dark no matter if its daylight or not at the surface, that's supposed to be the hardest part of the game and the most dangerous, you're supposed to die there quite a bit and run a risk everytime you go down there.\n* I found getting overpowered extractors to be too costly, I can get 2 regular extractors far cheaper thatll give me the same output.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n------------------\nGood way to kill some time, is it worth full price? Meehhhhhh.  Its worth $9.99 in my opinion, nothing more.

If you dont do that and the game crashes, you´ll have to start from beginning.\n\n- That´s the adventure mode-\n\nTheres a sandbox and survival mode too.\nDidn´t test them. But in order to play survival you need to complete the game in Adventure mode. ( and because the game decided to crash i couldn´t finish it...)\nThe sandbox mode is available from the start and is all about building.","June 8, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's pretty, easy, and relaxing. That being said the game is marketed as a Survival/Adventure game which should not be easy or relaxing. I made it threw both game modes without a single death, resources are so plentiful that you will never want for anything, and in most cases I beat the game without using the top tier equipment.\n\nOne concept that I liked was in order to mine one of the more rare resources you had to kill the giant squids that were protecting it. This was itroduced half way threw the game and is a fun miniboss battle. What was dissapointing was  that the squids are the hardest enemies, and there is no actuall "boss" in the game. Being able to kill the stongest enemies with early game equipment is not caracteristic of the Survival game genre.\n\nFor something that is supposed to be a Survival/Adventure game it feels like an early access game instead of a final product. As a casual game, however, it feels just right.","June 26, 2014","true","3.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The randomly generated map is littered with all kinds of treasures and resources to find, from ship wrecks to veins of gold sticking out of the rock, all of which show up clearly on the minimap.\n\nCrafting, in my honest opinion, is a little too simple. Within 10 minutes I had all the crafting stations set up in my tiny starter base, and had already started equipping the next tier of diving gear that allowed me to reach the darker depths of the sea. But thankfully, exploration is limited by the amount of air left for you to breath. While this can be upgraded along with how far below the ocean you can travel and the amount of damage you can resist, the time limit means you need to be careful you don't wander too far from your base. Thankfully additional bases can be build, if you can find the appropriate materials.\n\nSo far I've only had two issues. The first being that I can't figure out why I can't use bandages. I'd select them in my inventory, click use and nothing will happen. Both inside and outside of my base. The second issue, though I doubt this will be a common problem, was that a shark somehow managed to attack me inside my base while I was doing some quick crafting. Other than that the game runs smoothly on the highest settings without any graphical lag or screen tearing.\n\nMy only criticism is that there appears to be a lack of things to craft. Outside of weapons, diving gear and additional building parts, the only craftable furniture are tables and stools. I would love to fill my base with more than just crafting stations, storage chests and plant pots.","April 26, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Then I encountered a bug, a pretty serious one, with one of the updates, and so I emailled the developer to report it, expecting it to take a while to fix.  I got an email back the same day thanking me, the patch was ready in 24 hours and available in 72 hours (time lag due to the delivery system).  I was also part of the pre release testing and again saw a developer who listened to his players and responded.\n\nI also saw a developer who knew where his game was headed, refusing to enter discussions of multiplayer options, but listening to improvements.\n\nI've played for about 60 hours total at the time of Steam launch, and I love this game, I'm now waiting to see what Tim's new project will be, hoping it will be another game i like and can enjoy.

I have been playing crafting/survival games for awhile now am  hooked on the genre. I tend to play horror games a lot also so when they are combined (like in 7 days to die) there is a good formula for a game. But as far as horror games go no amount of zombies or mutilated aliens or jump scares or screaming bloody murder is truly scary. The reason being is that games and movies have been all over those settings for a long time, and they have become a big repetitive. Zombies, aliens, obscene amounts of gore, thats old material.\n\nNow, what isn't old material:deep, dark oceans, drowning, massive sea monsters, and whatever that feeling is that everyone had when they were a kid and they swam in the deep end of the swimming pool, afraid somehow there was a massive shark or octopus underneath you.\n\nFarSky takes advantage of these fears, and combined with it's unique setting makes for a perfect formula of a game that fulfills the void left by the fact that there has not been any kind of game like it. Deep ocean has got to be the best grounds for a survival game there is. I just finished the game and have got to say it was fun, really fun, especially when I was running (swimming) for my life trying to get into my base before a shark ripped my arm off. And the bone chilling feeling of fragile safety being inside of my base looking out the windows at the dark, scary ocean and seeing hordes of dangerous fish really made me feel immersed in the game. Knowing that a piece of glass was all that protected you from an infinite expanse of your worst childhood nightmares was nice feature, and  Jumping off an undersea cliff really gave me a feeling of adventure. Also it got me immediately thinking about all the horrible sea monsters that could be below me, which got me thinking I need to get back to my base and go back to that feeling of safety that felt so good. I give this game a well deserved 10/10.","April 26, 2014","true","10.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But unfortunately this game is really very weak. It takes only about 3 hours, give or take, to finish it by getting the submarine and returning to the surface and there is not much meat on it bones. You can easily gather enough resource to craft a rediculous amount of high tier object which only means you need and insanly large storage facility to store them as there is not enough object variety to craft that would warrent being able to deplete your large resource stockpile. Even the high tier items are limited to being about maybe 10 things in total. The map, while randomly generated is actually small it takes about a minute or so just to cross from one end to the other, even going to the lowest depth possible isn't very rewarding as it is pretty much like the top level, lots of light with lots of undersea plants.  If your looking for a game that is good for killing small amounts of time then this game might be for you if your willing to pay $15 for what little you get.\n\nI would get a refund if I knew it were possible.","October 19, 2014","false","5.3"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","15","31","0","2"

It makes exploring in sandbox mode so much more difficult, needing to remember which way you too to get to some new resources..Few times I have died this way completely unessacary, and could easily be prevented by a compass, and/or have your base stay on your radar/map as you leave further from it.\n\nI have actual scuba training, you should have a compass, it's implimented on hookups to your tank for crying out loud with your regulator, and octopus. Also Why can you only jump like 4 or 5 times underwater? You have a BC (Boyancy control Device) Which can add or remove air from your suit which will raise or lower you by itself, let alone your legs.. Jumping up onto ledges as you rise from a far depth...what?\n\nIt's also missing alot of equipment and other things that could of easily been added to it.. Sure you got a knife, and a speargun, and spears, by why can't you use a spear as a long range melee weapon when only 1 left, or create a longer one just for it? You can only build a table, and a stool for furnature for luxury wise, and other than your workshops, theirs not much else to do besides quickly upgrading your gear.\n\nSure it has fun exploration, and it's cool to see the wild-life in action, but their isn't really much to do when you get down to it. It has abit of replay value because of the generation and the sealife cause you won't always see a blue-whale pass you by or dolphins, even anglerfish. But that can only last so long, when they missed out on the building entirely. Not much terrain reform either even from mining, the chances of getting the ore just goes down, and is replaced by rock.\n\nThe worst thing of it all though is when you die, because theirs no HUD display of your corpse,  let alone your base, it's pretty much lost, and you will never find your stuff again, and if you're like me all your non important stuff that you have plenty of is stashed away while you have all the rare materials on you. As your entire inventory, and belt is wiped out, left only with the 3 basic equipment items you have on. Many times have I just started a new game because of this.\n\nIf you want a slow-paced game focusing mainly on exploration with abit of free-building then sure this game is for you, but if you're thinking it's going to be more in line with how much other games out there like this have to offer, minecraft, the forest, 7 days to die etc, have more, and the last two are still in development. It is relaxing though, and is fun, but it kind of wears itself out quick at this rate unless they randomly come out with a patch.\n\nSo yes I recommend this game, but be aware that theirs not as much as it seems.

It does not suck though. I wouldn't pay full price, but at the sale price of $1.50 I think it was a great deal. It has a few hours worth of content and can actually be really challenging at times. It can be glitchy and it'll seem like the sharks are shooting up out of the ground at you sometimes, but I personally enjoyed my time playing. It seems like it had a bunch of potential but most of it was wasted, it wasn't a waste of my time or $ though. Would get my base destroyed by a Kraken while I bleed out again.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/poodlechowder/recommended/286340/","poodlechowder","Deeje","http://steamcommunity.com/id/poodlechowder/","351 products in account","I felt the need to say something about this game after seeing all the negative reviews. First of all, I would like to state that in my opinion this game is complete. I found no bugs, broken features or obviously missing features. It's difficult, intriguing and definitely fun to play.\n\nThe price is probably the only thing off about this game. I think it is well worth $5 to $7, but $10 is pushing it. I say this because you can get games like Terraria for the same price that provide much, much more content.\n\nThe game is built with Java, just like Minecraft, but it is a lot more resource heavy than Minecraft. I found that on an older PC I couldn't run this game at a decent FPS, even though I could run somewhat modern games easily. My new computer is not top of the line but can run it maxed out with no issues.\n\nFarSky has a short campaign that you should try to finish as quickly as possible. It isn't difficult enough. You will dream of constructing new bases only to find that the map is scattered with bases already built for you. No, what you want to do is finish the campaign quickly so you can unlock sandbox mode, which is where the real fun lies.\n\nGive it a chance next time you see it for $5 or less.","December 5, 2015","true","19.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

After you realize the drill can drill the floor, and that the floor's texture determines what you get (iron, copper, sand, etc), you'll have no shortage of ingredients. The only threats left are pressure, air supply, and various nasty fish. While the first two are easy to dodge, the viscious fish are unpredictable and more irritating than challenging - once you figure out how to actually attack (intuitive controls lacking), you'll have no trouble fending them off. (but escape is rarely an option - they will hunt you till you get into safety, hence the irritation). All in all, the survival starts off exhilarating but rapidly becomes a chore.\n\nLike in certain other creative sandbox games (which may or may not contain mines), there is a nighttime during which the nasty fishes are more numerous and aggressive. The idea being (I think?) that you go into your base and build amazing cool base parts. Except that the base can only be made from floor, walls, walls with glass, ladder to another floor, plant pot, and 5 crafting stations. Oh, and a stool and a table and some chests. This means that, aside from building an enormous tunnel, there's not much you can do. There's no creativity, the components are extremely restricted in how they can be combined, and the result is generic, boring and bland. The screenshots of the base are the most you'll ever achieve (aside from creating a boring, extremely large pile of boxes filled with plant pots). Also, with night time being "death time" outside the base, you spend half the time idling around your boring cube, which on the plus side is an ideal time to make real-world coffee. Perhaps a bed to sleep the remainder of the night away would improve things  but...\n\nThat said, even if there was a bed, the collection of minerals is equally boring. You can either stare at a rockface with a drill or set up an extractor. Either way the minerals are ultimately just a means to upgrade your base (or reach more minerals), which, as I described above, isn't really worth doing.\n\nOnce you figure out how to do stuff (e.g. drill the terrain and that spears aren't weapons without a speargun rawr), you can quickly build the highest level suit and complete the "story". There's no reason to stick around after that, and the story definitely isn't reason enough to play this game. All in all, I don't recommend this game.","May 5, 2015","false","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is low-fidelity enough to be able to run on practically any machine.\n\nI just wish there was more to it.\n\nAs it is, the game offers about 1-4 hours of solid gameplay, depending on your pacing in games like this. Once you complete the submarine in survival for the first time, you have seen pretty much everything. I find myself coming back and playing in the sandbox from time to time, but never for more than a few hours.\n\nIt's a shame. The game has a lot of potential to be good, but the developers seemed to give it a cold-release and then abandoned it. I would definitely play more if I had more stuff to do.\n\nIf it ever shows up in a bundle, it's worth having a look at.

I didn't expect it to be as fun as it is. It seemed like every other survival game I've played but the underwater environment changes everything. The predators are actually dangerous, you have to eat frequently, and you have to watch your oxygen and pressure levels closely. When I was being hunted, I actually felt a twinge of fear and anxiety. Of course, the music and scenery are beautiful and go together hand-in-hand. Plus the added replayability of survivor mode and sandbox mode. I'd say it's one of the better survival games available on steam. Definitely a 8/10.\n\nMy hope is that they bring more depths to the game to add with the already beautiful and expansive landscape and to make exploring that much more enjoyable.\n\nEDIT: Since reviewing the game, I have come to learn that there have been no updates or new content at all. That's a little ridiculous. I wouldn't say it's worth its price but for like $3 grab it.

Gameplay is largely split between a scavenger hunt-esq element in which you try to locate the pieces of your Sub and crafting elements that enable you to improve your scuba gear, weaponry and base. The controls are quite pleasent and very rarely feel slack. graphically it's no triple A title...but it's of reasonable quality and very rarely distracts from the overall gameplay. While I can reccommend picking it up at a sale price I honestly couldnt reccommend this title at full price. the main reasoning is that there really isnt that much to do in game...realistically as long as you dont bother the other fish and dont go to mad jumping around you can collect all the pieces of your submarine having never really engaged with any enemys.\n\nAlsowhile it is a lot of fun to custom build a seabase (Reinacting Sealab 2021 will always be a well appreciated thing in my book) theres only so many times you can build and re-build your base before it starts wearing a bit. The game is entirely Sandbox esq...but with it being under the ocean short of looking for the odd treasure chest theres surprisingly little down there...\n\nAnother let down would be the fact that the only other mode in the game is effectively an "Advanced" mode where you play the game as normal only now it doesnt direct you to where the submarine parts are...which will probably double your playtime but adds little to the overall game itself...\n\nAt sale price this game is a totally fun way to kill an hour or 4...and in that capacity I can really reccomend this game, it's a lot of fun!. But if it's being charged at the current full retail, the lack of alternative modes, interesting finds/easter eggs, and just general lack of anything other than the main "Find the sub" quest I cant honestly reccommend this at full price. if it's in the sale give it a try and release your inner captain murphy :)","August 17, 2015","true","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Then everything gets repetitive, there's not even a point in opening "treasure" chest, there is same ♥♥♥♥ everywhere. Base building would be awesome if it only had ANY sense. You just swim from one part of the map to the other, discover some big, awfully projected bases and almost never return to the one base you built.

Initially I was really drawn to the game and wanted to p[lay it, then, I started to figure out how to findo resource, even though there are many things that could better be explained. The the rogue element kicked in, which initiall was ok...but then it starte dto get frustrating, mainly bcause a better explanation of what you needed to harvest to make things could have helped me plan what I needed to gather first. Then the aggrevation of all creatures attackiong you for no damn reason, even Jelly fish, which eben though they hurt, do NOT aggressively attack you in real life!\nThere is a LOT of find an harvest items to build stuff to harverst better items them going on...and in the middle of that, you have to crafter better weaponry to kill fish for food, which attracts predators(Sharks, Barracuda, etc.)  It can get pretty damn aggrevating sometimes...\nTHEN.... when you die, if you die AGAIN, which will happen, while enroute to getting your stuff you dropped when you died...THEN...you lose all the stuff you were after. So, hopefully you have enough iron to build a dripp or have excavators out in an iron deposit so you can harvest some to build another drill, knofe, etc... or you are screwed and starting over.\n\nThere are many addicting things to thi game. Even though the graphics are more on the simple side, there are so many wonders to behold.\n\nAt the same time, there is a SH!7 load of frustrating things going on  that don't necessarily need to be happening. Creature are not going to attack you as freuently as they do in this game.\n\nAt the end of the day, it still gets you with, ok...just one more game and I am quitting for the day...and hours later you are still playing. Whether to catch back up or see what is next...you just keep getting drawn back in.\n\nI just had a bad run and am frustrated and, as much as I want to slam the game and say..NO, don't buy it. That would not be fair, because I am already thinking about what I will do when I play again.\n\nThe game is not complicated, there is a good risk reward and the randomness that happens in real life that we all hate. Suck it up cupcake, it is what it is.\n\nYou will need to balance mining/exploring/hunting to succeed, and, it will be worth it. The worlds are randomly generated so every time you start a new game, it will be different form the last.\n\nI do recommend the game. Enjoy the sights and sounds, there are many! You will not forget the first time you hear a whale!\n\nSee you in Deco!\n\nStephen","February 14","true","6.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You've got a handful of resources to keep track of, a couple weapons, a few enemies, etc. It's not complicated. But I would argue that makes it all the more fun and enjoyable; it's a very relaxing game that has enough of a "story" (well, a motivation at least) to keep you engaged and exploring but nothing that weighs heavily on the mind. You explore an ocean, progressively going deeper and deeper as you try and find the pieces of your submersible while trying not to drown or get eaten.\nWhich isn't that hard, and that's okay! FarSky is a game you sit down for a few hours, get lost in the tranquil oceans, find some pieces, escape, and eventually put away. As long as you don't pay more than ten dollars, I think you'll get your money's worth out of it.","February 4","true","8.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Because of that, I really wish I could recommend this game. The mechanics are straightforward and plain, the design of the game is simple and beautiful. The game is low-fidelity enough to be able to run on practically any machine.\n\nI just wish there was more to it.\n\nAs it is, the game offers about 1-4 hours of solid gameplay, depending on your pacing in games like this. Once you complete the submarine in survival for the first time, you have seen pretty much everything. I find myself coming back and playing in the sandbox from time to time, but never for more than a few hours.\n\nIt's a shame. The game has a lot of potential to be good, but the developers seemed to give it a cold-release and then abandoned it. I would definitely play more if I had more stuff to do.\n\nIf it ever shows up in a bundle, it's worth having a look at.

It plays very well and looks good enough. Besides some sound bugs (for which I needed to restart the game occasionally) I had  no problems/gamebreaking bugs.\nThe game is rather short (3 hours for the story) and offers not that much replay value.\n\nUnderwater bases can be expanded but there is almost no need to do that, It's way to easy to get food and once you figured out the Predator A.I. the game gets quite easy.\nBUT it was fun. At least for me.\nI have a fear of deep water. That means for me it was an Underwater-Survial-Building-Horror game.  Drilling ores without knowing whats behind/above/next to you  makes the athmosphere tense. Especially in night time in which enemies get more aggressive and attack for no apparent reason.\nSome ores are too rare (liek silver) which makes it hard to build some tools. I only found 2 silver ores within the entire story. Probably I'm just unlucky.\n\nEven tho the story was dull and the game a bit too easy, the tense athmosphere with it's fitting music and the exploration of these hostile waters made it a very nice experience.","May 12","true","6.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I probably shouldn't have spent so much time of my life with this sparkly little turd, but we all have our guilty pleasures yeah?\n\nStory:\n\nFarSky is a game about returning to the surface of the ocean after some unexplained disaster has caused your submarine to be destroyed. You play as Nathan, and are (I hesitate to use this word) 'guided' by some woman Nathan aparently knows. Early in the game she gives you two good survival tips, and after that her and Nathan's dialogue is practically non-existant. She does however inform Nathan that once he fixes his submarine and reaches the surface, she will be able to send a rescue team after him.\n\nBehind the Scenes:\n\nPositive Points:\n+Simple control scheme. It only took me about ten minutes to get comfortable with the controls and stop pulling up my inventory at awkward times.\n\n+Pretty visuals. While this is by no means a graphic monument, some of the scenery is very nice and it's fun to look at the various sea creatures.\n\n+Not a difficult game. You don't need to have any particular skill set to finish the game.\n\n+Easy crafting system. The items you need to make something are shown to you, and simply having them in your inventory will allow you to make it.\n\nNegative Points:\n\n-Getting food: With how rapidly enemy aggro builds vs how easy it is to shake aggro, hunting fish for food is a daunting task that barely even provides for you. Growing crops also takes a long time and unless you build a large farming area fairly quickly, you won't be able to stockpile enough to keep you full either.\n\n-No replay value. Sorry. Actually, playing it for a couple hours will give you all the game play value.\n\n-Minimal music or sound scores aside from enemies and character generated noises. There is some relaxing music that plays at night time, but other than that there are maybe 2 music tracks?\n\n-Difficult combat system. Fighting wild life just doesn't work underwater folks. The knife doesn't do nearly enough damage to be worth using, and firing the spear gun is more trouble than it's worth too. (This coming from a guy who's been playing Gears of War and Unreal Tournament the past five years.)\n\n-Enemy aggo: Basically if you pee in one fishes cornflakes, you are going to have an entire ocean coming after you. Enemies will come at you from a ridiculous distance and won't stop until you get back inside your base. Even if you kill a fish and leg it out of the area, one drop of blood is enough.\n\nNeutral Points:\n\nEasily exploitable. I'm not saying I don't exploit the game and have fun doing it, but a well made game shouldn't have too many ways to get around things that is based on trickery, not skill.\n\nClipping issues? I'm not sure if this is just because my computer isn't designed for any sort of gaming, but I've noticed that many times I'll have enemies randomly plow through my base or a solid rock wall with no apparent effect on me.\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nFarSky is about building a submarine and getting back to the surface of the ocean. It has a couple things that make it worth a three or four hour play, but anything past that isn't all that satisfying. There are one or two good points of the game, but a slew of issues that suggest it was abandoned during development. Thankfully, nothing game breaking. If you can get this game on sale or through SteamShare give it a go, otherwise I'd advise giving this one a pass.\n","November 11, 2015","false","10.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tadmeister69/recommended/286340/","tadmeister69","tadmeister69","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tadmeister69/","290 products in account","First let me say that I actually REALLY ENJOYED THIS GAME (despite giving it a thumbs down)! The atmosphere, sounds, graphics and gameplay are all great and I can see the Dev has put a lot of effort into producing what is here; however that unfrotunately is the problem - for the price of this game there just isn't enough content, which really is a shame considering how good this game could be with more development!\n\nI played adventure mode for 4 hours before I completed my submarine and was able to surface (effectively the end of the game). This was while taking my time to fully enjoy the game (I could have easily reached this point within 2 hours) - I'd fixed 3 other bases i found, build my own base, setup a harpoon array protecting my base, setup a miniture farm (growing potatoes, beans & carrots) built all in game objects and taken on the krackens while stealing their crystals (although I'm still not sure if they have a use...).  I'd say I really enjoyed the first 2 hours, but after that I was really just looking for more to do, and unfortunately there just wasn't anything else.  By the end this really made the game feel like a shallow experience (excuse the pun), where so much more could have been achieved with more content and structure.  I've started survivor mode but it does seem like more of the same, just you only have 1 life, and I'm not big on the permadeath thing, so while this miht be a big draw for some it doesn't add extra life to the game for me.\n\nIf this was half the price, in Early Access or if the dev adds additional content I'd give this a thumbs up for sure, but for a finished product on Steam for £10, I just really can't recommend it as it is currently.  Not when there are some fantastic games on steam for a third of the price.\n\n\nI really hope the dev takes this constructively and adds more content, as I'd love to play more (and I will deffinitely keep an eye ourr for more oth their games)! Here are some suggestions I'd have for if the dev ever wanted to add more content or create DLC for this game;\n- add more environments (caves, shipwrecks, abyss etc)\n- add some side missions (maybe related to why he's down there in the first place?)\n- maybe create some exploratory missions (i.e. you have to find the bases down there to get something hidden in each)\n- make fixing the sub harder (currently you just find 9 pieces and it appears.  Maybe you could have to fix or power the sub too)\n- add areas of individuality to make it worth exploring (maybe things like coral gardens or the formentioned environments)\n- more things to do with you living space (if the game was longer I could see myself wanting to make this more like a temporary home)\n- more gradients for suite depth. Currently i just built one suit and could go straight to 350m.\n- more things to build/craft and more ores to find.","April 29, 2014","false","7.7"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

FarSky is light on story as well as content.\n\nThe game will take most people two hours tops to finish. It is an underwater exploration game where you must find 9 pieces of your broken submarine to escape. Most of your time will be spent scaging for supplies, which are mostly easy to find and unlimited (minus a few rare items, like gold) once found. The game isn't very diffucult, though predators (sharks, etc) will kill you on sight, rarely is there a chance to escape, and at night time they are everywhere, leaving you standing in base for minutes at a time doing nothing.\n\nThe atmosphere is fantastic though, you really feel like you are explording the unknown of the ocean and fearful of what you might encounter next, and also the pure lonelyness of being at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nOnce the main mode is finished, you unlike a harder variation of it, that gives you one life. I only used 4 lives during my playthrough.\n\nThere is a sandbox mode where you can use coins found in the normal mode to buy objects and use them as you see fit, but the building options and crafting is pretty limited, so I don't see it having very long legs. The only things you can craft are pieces of equipment, food, weapons, and bases / furniture, something uneeded in the core game.\n\nFor $15 the asking price is a bit much. This game would be easily recommendable at $5, but in the current form and price I can't recommend anyone buy it, unless they just can't help but want to get mauled by sharks underwater.\n\nI can say I did have fun with the game while it lasted, it is an enjoyable experience, it just ends too soon and doesn't feel like a fully realized concept, just the tip, if you will.\n\nIf you'd like to see what the game is like here is a fully playthrough of the original mode by yours truely. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzOSSXPoCAs","April 29, 2014","false","2.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I has great potential, but it never quite became the awesome game it should have been.\n\nCrafting...\nThe crafting is pretty week. You access the crafting table and choose the item you want, if you have the correct ingrediants in your inventory, the item is instantly made.\n\nNone of the items are complicated at all. Use 20 copper ore, 2 gold, and POOF, you have an underwater scooter. There is no refining of minerals, there is no crafting of smaller components to later build a more complicated item.\n\nAlso if you want to build something , but don't have the ingrediants it will show you tiny little icons of what you need, but it doesn't say what those icons are. For example I needed to make a bandage to stop my bleeding, and it needed seaweed, but the icon didn't look like seaweed and I could find anything that I was harvesting that had an icon that looked like the one shown.\n\nOne last thing about the crafting. The ore to mine is everywhere. You are litterly surrounded by it. There is more ore around you then just regular stone.\n\nGraphics...\nThe game looks very beautiful lots of underwater eye candy, The best part of the game is the look and feel of your surroundings.\n\nSound...\nSound isn't too bad, but when night comes you get some fairly bad music start to play. seems like they were trying to copy minecraft here, but where mine craft music is peaceful sounding, this music doesn't give me that feeling.\n\nThe combat is also pretty week. The fish AI is basically always the same from every fish...charge at you at high speed straight on.\n\nThis game could have been so much better, but it feels like a game that is still in Alpha, but it is a finished game.\n\n\n","October 8, 2014","false","2.2"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"

The scenery is pleasant from my short time playing. I would spend more time with it, but the game spans my dual monitor setup in both full screen and windowed mode making all the center game action fall on the gap between my two monitors. There seems to be no adjustment for window size and I've been unable to find any tips or tricks in the forum to overcome this shortcoming. There seems to be very little activity in the forums from the dev and forum chatter is that the dev is done with this game and is/has moved on to something else. I do feel cheated, as I could not play the game in a suitable way and there may never be fixes.\n\nMaybe this game and other projects like it should have a Steam category like: Temporal, Short run, Test bed, etc. Something identifying such projects as something with short lived dev updates and support. The price for such games should have a cap as well. I realize original titles like Farsky take much effort to bring to market, but if it's meant to be a short lived project, then don't soak players, because we will be less likely to buy games from that dev again.

In fact There are less then 40 recepies(Minecraft has almost 100 or maybe more).\n\nThe bigest problem though is the exploration, The player is always limited to maximum presure of used diving suit, What realy hurts is that  one ore that is required to make better helmets for presure resistance almost always spawns in tons just a few hundred meters below the starting depth tolerance. This forced me to restart a game more times then i can count.\n\nAnother isuee is  the day and night mecanic. In minecraft it was a chalange becouse monsters could find you.

The art design, the music, the crafting system all work to create a tranquil gaming experience.  The storyline is basic - survive, repair and return - you decide how/when/where to do that.  There are a variety of aquatic life forms - both flora and fauna - to delight the eye and add to immersion; but insufficient to encourage re-playability without the player's own ingenuity.   The cooking/farming and crafting are entertaining, but expanding those skills falls short of really essential.  That all being said - its a game I return to time and time again, and still thoroughly enjoy!\n\nThere are mysteries to unravel - decisions to be made, and not just the ones mandated by the story mode.  Nuances of the environment(s) to explore.  The game is more than just "find the pieces", but we (the player) have to make it so; being able to mod it would go a LONG way toward extending re-playability. As a single person team, it would also go a long way toward removing the governors from this project allowing this game to truly do the genre justice!   There is SUCH awesome potential laying fallow here for a phenomenal game!\n\nWould I recommend it?  Yes, with a disclaimer.  Its beautiful, entertaining, marginally challenging but requires a lot of player innovation to prolong the fun.  If you take your time there IS a pearl in this oyster, albeit a small one at the moment.  Here's hoping it grows...","November 24, 2014","true","36.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like to explore and I like combat, and I had fun playing it.  I usually only build what is useful and necessary in sandbox games, so the simplicity of the bases and equipment was not a negative for me.\nI most enjoyed Survival mode, available upon completion of the initial Adventure mode.  The increased difficulty of Survival mode made the game quite challenging and required careful resource management decisions.  It was most satisfying to earn my way back up to the top of the food chain.\nSurvival Advice:  At your first opportunity, make two underwater scooters to alternate between.  Move extractors around.  One can always open the inventory screen and heal at leisure, so carry ample food and bandages.  Predators only attack when there is blood in the water (or at night), so hunt with caution or while carrying serious firepower.  Enough harpoon cannons around your base can tranform threats into food.  There is no easier target to hit than one heading directly at you.","February 9, 2015","true","55.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The reason is the unique setting: surving and building a camp under water? Yes, please! :D\n\nThe first couple of hours are both the most interesting and the most frustrating. There's no handholding in this game. Figuring out how to build, repair, keep your hunger in check and gather resources are all up to you. Frustrating, but not EXACTLY in a bad way. After finally figuring out I had to first craft a knife so I could hunt fish, I felt like a bad ♥♥♥ not dying of hunger, and even more after finding out how that cooker worked to lower the hunger percentage even MORE. So more tutorials certainly could improve this game, but it didn't hinder me that much.\n\nWhat did hinder me, though, was that after the initial surface of the game, there were no advanced techniques. Once you've learned how to basically survive, explore, expand and repair your base, you're pretty much done. And that's a pity. There is a huge amount of potential for much more than what actually is in this game. Since this is a one man's job, I can't really expect AAA-like polish and finesse, but even then...it has more going for it than there currently is (droid control, sleeping mechanics, food preservation, advanced base customization, ...).\n\nHowever, I need to stress that while not playing as a critic, I certainly had fun. It's nice to explore, see what you can find and scavenge the bottom of the sea in search of resources. It has great immersion and the setting is (as I said in the beginning of this review) unique. Kind of sad the developer stopped adding things, but I wouldn't say it's an unfinished product.","January 27, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is not a super-serious game, but it gives you the under-water aquatic life style feel you want.\n\nThe music for the game is lovely, I'd buy the soundtrack if I had money to spare for it.\n\nThe idea of the campaign is to find 9 pieces of your missing submarine, while expanding your aquatic underwater base to survive and gather equipment.\n\nHunt fish for food, but be wary as sharks and other predators will smell the blood and attack you.\n\nThere are 3 levels of depth in the game, which you can easily clear if you mine the ores and create the necessary equipment.  Which becomes very redundant in the sandbox mode which at most can entertain you for a good 16 hours.\n\nI do reccomend this game as I bought it on sale for $4.99, but I would not reccomend paying the full price of the game as others have mentioned it is not worth the $15 full price.","January 5, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The number of objects you can craft is in the area of 30, no mod support, and the Dev has declared the game complete. So don't expect Minecraft.\n\nFor all that it fun to tool around the ocean for a few hours. Explore the depths, get murdered by sharks and worse.

The developer has said that it was intentionally made short so that is to be expected. The visuals are great and the atmosphere is amazing.\n\nThe crafting system is not the most intuitive, but definitely not bad by any means. It has a little bit of story to it, but it still feels very immersive. No voice acting lends to this game's pros.\n\nThe hardest aspect of the game is figuring out where to find materials since the game doesn't actually say, but one quick google search cleared it all up for me. The sea creatures were very well modeled and textured, and the map, while small, was enjoyable yet tense (in a good kinda way) to explore.\n\nOverall, I love this game and highly recommend it, but I personally don't know if 20 dollars is the best price for it. It has no multiplayer, no mods, and no more updates coming so I would probably wait until it goes on sale before buying it if you're on the fence with the price.

I honestly think it's because it's so short, not in spite of it.  The first time I installed it, there was a bit of a learning curve (no tutorials, but I don't recall this game even sent me wiki-hunting).  Once I figured out what I was supposed to be doing, finding all the submarine pieces went pretty quick.  I "won" the game, said, "That wasn't bad," and uninstalled to pare down some of the "wall of text" that was my games list.\n\nA couple of months later, frustrated with balance issues in an Early Access sandbox game, I just wanted a sandbox. game. that. worked.  Where the enemies were probably going to murder me, sure, but only if I wasn't smart enough to avoid them.  Where the equipment worked as planned and had clear crafting goals.  And that was only as grindy as I wanted it to be, because I was really, really sick of spending ten hours looking for the most basic components and getting slaughtered by the equivalent of slimes spawning every three seconds.  In short, I wanted something casual where I didn't feel like lighting my computer on fire an hour in.  So I reinstalled it, "beat" the game again (I seem to stick with Adventure Mode with this game, not Sandbox), had that brief feeling of accomplishment, and uninstalled again.\n\nYeah, I went through that cycle three more times before I finally just left the game right where it was.  Now whenever I want something short and simple I don't even have to walk away from--at this point I can fix a submarine in 90 minutes--I fire this up, noodle around for a bit and call it good.\n\nCons:\nIt's short\nThere's not a whole lot of variation in crafting materials, things to build, or things to kill\nThere's no tutorial (that I can remember--at this point, if they've added it, I'm long past looking for it)\n\nPros:\nIt's short\nThere's enough rarity built-in to get you out of your base without being a ten-hour grind\nA tutorial wasn't really necessary\n\nTL;DR:  Don't go into it expecting a five-course meal, but if all you want is a candy bar, it's pretty satisfying.","December 19, 2014","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You know, the kind where you are lagging to the point of insanity; unable to play your purchase?! However, when I went to launch it, Javascript came up. That was when I knew: this was going to be a great lag-free experience! Everyone who owns a Mac: This will not disappoint. Of course, you may want to watch gameplay of it first, to get familiar. But otherwise, this is a flowing game! The dynamics of it are great, and the crafting is very simplistic: making gameplay fun to any new players! I highly recommend it. There are in fact three modes of play, one of which mut be unlocked by beating the game once. The Adventurer is for all easy play; with little predator NPCs and such, and easy spawns. The Survivor gamemode installs fears like you wouldn't believe. Sharks and other predators spawn more frequently, and have a higher count, making exploration a nightmare. Finally, there is the sandbox mode, where you take any gold you've found in any of the other two gamemodes and decide what items you spawn with, the map seed, and so on.\n\nOverall, I would recommend it to those who want an easy, laid back, material-mining gaming experience, with the beauty of the ocean's depths!\n\n(Only con here to report is the bug where sound in the game sorta stops, unless you quit and re-enter the game.

I sat down and played through it in 1 hour and 45 minutes. Definitly not worth $7.50, I would say a good price woukld be $3 to $5. That's all I have to say on this game. Waaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy to expensive for the amount of game you can play.

The depths seem to be divided in three sections. highest has sharks, barracudas (if i spelled that correctly.)  generic fish life, and iron.  Mid depth has copper, more fish types, frill sharks, and angler fishes. bottom level has giant octopi,\n\nYou have to play the story to unlock survival, i believe. But the story is short. collect 9 submarine peices and resurface.  to get the sub peices you have to make a suit able to handle the next level of depth.\n\nmechanics in the game. you have a limited air supply which you have to return to base to refill. there are a few vegetables you can farm in your base as well as hunting fish. (blood will spill and attract predators. from what i recal and you can get a bleeding status in this game.) you have 5 jumps to so you feel good about climbing back up the cliff face.\n\nMy issue with the game.. I haven't played the survival so i don't know if there is more to it or not... in story from what i saw, even after getting the sub you could only dive 350 meters down. when you depth gauge would list hundreds more.. and you can stare off into the abyss... so further exploration is just sitting there teasing you. not letting you have it... you get used to the predators FAST. They also kinda loose their threat when you get a spear gun.. which is the only real weapon you can use against them.. the knife is more for hunting and the predators... well arn't easy to just hunt.  I guess where I'm going with this is.. I got used to it to fast. As while it has a lot to offer. it doesn't stay new as long as i wish it would.\n\nI love the idea of a game like this.. I just wish there was more to it than there is.. that's not nessicarilly a bad thing.. it left me wanting more.. and i can only hope there will be more added. But for now.. is it worth the 15$.. the fact that i realized 3 hours had passed only after they had passed.  is a good notion to it being worth it.. but how long before it becomes repetative to me is what makes me wonder if the 15$ is worth it.","July 13, 2014","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combat's what you'd expect, nothing overly spectacular. You can pretty much kill anything with the same technique. My only quarrel is that it didn't really have much to offer after you'd maxed your gear, crafted all the shiny stuff, and completed the adventure mode, which can be done quite easily in about 4-5 hours. Overall if you're looking for something that's short and sweet, fairly immersive and not overly fast paced than this game is going to be the way to go.

The graphics are a bit chunky and aren't anything to write home about, but they get the point across without feeling cluttered and there are lots of pretty sea creatures and seascapes to look at.\n\nAt the same time, the constant pressure of the depleting air tank, Nathan the Diving Man's stomach, and all of the pretty sea creature who want to murder the heck out of you keep the game from being a walk in the park.\n\nThis is not a long game, nor is it a particularly difficult one. Taking even basic precautions should keep you from getting eaten and skilled survivor gamers will probably be able to beat both Adventure AND the more difficult Survivor mode in just a few hours.

Looks gorgeous, plays nice and easy and performs smooth but has a very limited gameplay scope. Consider it an anti-stress game to grab ONLY during a sale.\n\nThere are gameplay elements, of course, and there is also a goal to be achieved here (in case you are playing the Story Mode), which is to gather the materials required to construct a submarine, with the (ironic) purpose of taking you back to the surface.\n\nSo, this is where you may be put off a bit, as this is what you WILL do (I can almost guarantee):\n\n-Gather Iron to Construct all the different crafting tables.\n\n-Hunt for some shipwrecks to get some crafting materials and also, to find some seeds and vases to grow your own potatoes and carrots.\n\n-Find some gold ore to be able to craft better helmets that allow you to go deeper in the water, so you can find some more crafting materials that combined with gold will allow you to craft better helmets that allow you to go deeper in the water, so you can find some more crafting materials that combined with gold will allow you to craft better helmets that allow you to go deeper in the water, so you can find some more crafting materials that combined with gold will allow you to craft better helmets that allow you to go deeper in the water... you get it\n\n-Find a knife so you can kill as much fish as you want without being worried with ammunition as you were until now with your harpoon, and also, so you can cut down algae and some "power algae" that provides you with a nice power orb (required for your submarine).\n\n-When you finally get your best helmet (and matching oxygen tank that will allow you to stay more time in the water), you can now access the depth at which the rare material spawns (and also where the most beautiful parts of the game).\n\n-Get the material, escape the furious Kraken(s) that where supposedly guarding it and craft the submarine to get back to the surface and win the game.\n\nAll I described above WILL be the thing that you will do in Story mode, for almost exactly an hour. There is a sandbox mode, which is basically the same but does not end the game when you get to the surface.That is where the survival ends and the "interactive experience" starts as you may explore the seemingly infinite randomly-generated underwater surface.\n\nStill interested?\nAs much as I like the game, I cannot recommend you to buy it in full price, but at the time I write this, there is a very tempting 80% discount, making it 3€.

I'm a sucker for underwater environments, and this one is a rather pretty, stylized one. Resource-gathering is also relatively easy compared to other survival games; resources are quite easy to spot, and you can put Extractors on resource deposits to mine while you explore.\n\nThis may mean, however, that the game is a bit too easy for Survival fans. The story mode is short, crafting is rather simplistic and there are far too few recipes. The sandbox suffers because of the lack of crafting; sure, you can make a huge underwater base, but you'll quickly run out of stuff to put in the rooms, for decoration or otherwise. Even the nastier creatures near the end of the game become pushovers once you've gotten some end-game items, which, again, aren't particularly hard to get thanks to Extractors.\n\nI hope the game's sparseness means that there will be content updates and such. Otherwise, the price tag is a little harder to justify. Still, I recommend it if only for the atmosphere, and I hope the devs expand this lovely game!","April 28, 2014","true","22.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The core gameplay is based around gathering minerals and finding food. All the while fighting off all manner of sea creatures, whether it be barracuda, sharks of various species or giant squid (or octopi).\n\nThis game will want you to keep playing for hours on end, its refreshing to see an adventure survival game that isnt FULLY voxel based, the base building is of course voxel based for simplicity, but this still allows for some intricate and beautiful designs.\n\nWhile its not exactly a system pusher or the next crysis, the art style is consistent(all be it pixelated) in convincing you that you are under the ocean. And finally if you have a friend with a terrible pc that cant run much this game is extremely lightweight and stable as well.\n\n7/10: because while it is lacking in alot of areas, what you get for 15 dollars really ammounts to 30+ hours of gameplay with multiple missions immersing you in the deep blue along with a relaxing casual play style compelling you to take it slow.","April 28, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Shark Attacks, Dark Waters, and The concept of nothingness.  Playing the adventure mode of this game, the hair was standing on the back of my neck as I walked through forests of Kelp.  The telltale sign of a predator charging me and I almost screamed, not knowing from where in the fields it was coming from.\n\nThen, I beat Adventure mode, and got to Survival.  More Predators, and less leniancy on death.\n\nI was hunting for food, which caused blood.  Blood attracts predators.  Predators want to eat your face.  I was attacked by a shark, knocked into a ravine, and died from pressure.\n\n\nThat being said, this game is a lot of fun, and really beautiful.  The Crafting System is pretty simple, and really straightforward, there's the ability to customize your base, and there's a sense of urgency when travelling due to your oxygen limits.\n\nI would definitely recommend giving this game a shot.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pwister/recommended/286340/","Pwister","Pwister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pwister/","234 products in account","TL;DR: 4/10\n\n\nThis game is fun for about 12 hours, and then all of it's appeal practically dissappears. FarSky is a survival game, where you not only have to worry about hunger and drowning, but also the many predators of the ocean. The game takes place on 3 main levels. A level at around 80 meters below, consisting of mostly Iron Ore and Sharks. A level at around 200 meters, consisting of mostly Copper, Angler Fish, and Jellyfish. And finally a level at around 300 meters, consisting of krakens and manganese (Yeah, I can't pronounce it half the time, either.) In about 20 minutes you can go from broke on the first layer, to decked out in full Manganese gear, as it's not really hard to obtain anything. The main goal of the main game is to find the pieces of your submarine, and get back to the surface, but there's not much appeal to that. All of the fun is because it's underwater, so why would I want to go back to the surface? Honestly, if you just wanted to beat the game, you could just get the Manganese stuff and a propellor, and be done within an hour. If you're like me, however, you won't want to be done by the time you get the submarine. I personally found it more compelling to use the submarine to explore more of the reef and expand on my little hideaway than to just leave behind everything I'd worked on for the past 2 hours.\n\nThis game is fun if you want to spend a few hours going from having nothing, to just too much of everything. If you like replayability, I suppose it has the appeal of having a different world each time, but that really doesn't mean much other than that there might be more silver (the most rare material) in one world than another. The controls aren't the best, and the "construction" is pretty bad. The music was good for a while, until it decided it wanted to just stop playing. The kraken fights are usually spiced up by a boss theme, but after 2 fights the song just never came back on, and I was left shooting giant squids in the silence of the ocean.\n\nGoing back to the topic of the procedurally generated world, all you have to navigate your way around it is this sonar map. The idea is cool, but it's really hard to actually gain your barings when the big map doesn't turn, but the minimap does. There aren't even compass directions on the minimap. I also found myself wishing time and again that there was some kind of manual waypoint system, so I didn't have to scour the map for the tiny dark icon of my base every time I wanted to go back. Not only that, but because the minimap turns relative to you, yet your icon turns on the big map, it makes it VERY difficult to actually tell what direction you're supposed to go.\n\n\nThe gameplay is fun, but could easily be changed for the better. The controls are usable at best. The soundtrack is great, when it actually feels like playing. DO NOT BUY THIS AT FULL PRICE, because you will not get more than a day of gameplay out of it. After 3 hours, I had seen the ins and outs of everything the game had to offer.\nI'm no professional reviewer, but if I were, I'd give this game a solid 4 out of 10.","April 17, 2015","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The crafting system is simple and utilitarian, it's not voxel-based, and there's no terraforming - resources are 'node' based, and you exhaust them with your hand-drill or with automated gathering devices you can find or make. The game is very focused on the procedures of sustaining oneself and surviving - producing food, collecting resources from the automatic gatherers etc. This lends itself well to a relaxing, "project-based" style of play: make the gear you need to descend that ravine to the crystal node, loot and repair this derelict base you've found, etc. I also appreciated the little touches that reflect the setting; one of the important nodes is soil, which on the sandy seabed is rarer than you'd think.\n\nThe main objective is to collect nine parts of your escape submarine, but the real meat of this game is expanding steadily across the ocean floor, figuring out where to base oneself in order to harvest from the nodes and gather from the shipwrecks without overextending yourself and running out of oxygen or daylight hours. Given the undersea setting the number of predators is about as diverse as you could hope for - multiple types of sharks, jellyfish, shoals of barracuda and lantern fish. They're not easily aggro'd during the day unless there's blood in the water, but at night they will happily tear you to shreds. They do, however, prove lucrative to hunt later on for food & this can prove quite exciting, especially with the prospect of the blood attracting more.\n\nThe main portion of the game took me about 7.5hrs to beat, and I've spent almost that amount of time again in the Sandbox mode (no submarine parts, just expansion). Beating the main section once unlocks a Hardcore mode - more aggressive enemies, one life etc - I don't really enjoy those types of games, but you may well do. In any game mode you collect gold coins in chests lying about, and these are used when starting up a new Sandbox-mode game to buy starting equipment.\n\nWhere this game falls short is the amount of content - more infinite sandbox games have spoiled us for sheer size, and given this game is much shorter than Minecraft or Terraria, that's also less time before you've essentially 'seen everything'. If, like me, you really enjoy the undersea setting you won't mind (it has more depth than a lot of the 'biomes' of similar games to make up for it having far fewer) but I still found myself wishing there were more things to find aside from shipwrecks - undersea ruins, maybe? The depth of technology, too, is a little shallow and while that's a product of the setting a few more branches on the tech tree like hunting gear or fish-husbandry would have gone a long way. Still, for one man and one year's worth of work, it's solidly made and satisfying to play.\n\nOverall, this is easily worth a solid 7 out of 10, an 8 or 9 if you're really into the setting. You'll get your money's worth, particularly if it's on sale, but without modding or multiplayer you'll eventually move on.","April 11, 2015","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is definatly needed to start, those that say it ruins the sense of survival are SO wrong, your oxygen levels from your tank wont last long (at the start) so you need the base to re-air(?) etc, its VERY helpful for a pre-base to be made, anyway you can just move and start from scratch later.\n\nYou need to find new resources for new better items, you need to be brave and go deeper into the ocean to find the rarer items.\n\nRisk your life, risk your oxygen, go deep, defend yourself from sharks, whales, jellyfish or whatever you find. Scavenge for food, eat and try to survive. CAREFUL dont go too deep at the start or you wont have enough stamina to jump/swim back up to a safe pressure level, your mask might start to crack - 8 seconds till your dead.\n\nIf you manage to get far enough, perhaps you will have multiple bases scattered in different areas with auto resources extractors, maybe you'll even have your own mini submarine for safe traveling?\n\nEither way, build on an endless world, new areas.

I spent 2 hours+ straight since i just couldnt close the game, "just one more resource"\n\nTRY IT!\n","May 6, 2014","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
