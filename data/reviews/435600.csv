Essentially, you are defending a tower from a variety of enemies.  You have quite a lot of options on defensive items to build between levels, and the action ramps up fairly quickly as you go along.\n\nOn the plus side, there are a lot of ways to customize your character with stat boosts and such. Plus the towers are fun to build and deploy. A good bit of strategy there.\n\nOn the negative side, if the setting changes, I haven't made it that far yet. I think you stay on the same tower for the entire game for as long as you can survive the waves.  This could become boring for some people after awhile.\n\nOverall, I'm enjoying the game and do recommend it.","March 16","true","0.7"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

It's a very dynamic game where enemies comes from every direction to destroy core of your tower and your goal is to defend it using multiple strategies with ton of perks you can choose from. Try to survive few waves and don't die too quickly ;)\n\nAdvantages\nA huge variety of mods, upgrades and skills to choose from\nVery nice and minimalistic graphics\nCo-op mode for 2 local players (I didn't tested it)\nGame is quite challenging, as after some waves of enemies it slowly becomes even overwhelming (game offers few difficulties so don't worry)\nDisadvantages\nGets pretty repetitive after a while, game unfortunately contains only one map\nGame doesn't saves progress nor gives you any kind of boosts or bonuses when you die\nSounds are not polished at all\nSummary\nGame is overally fun for what it is and yes, might get boring, but before it will happen, you will have some great fun trying to get further and further, trying out different tactics. Idea of blending those few game styles is also a nice thing and as you can all see, it worked out pretty interesting. I really hope that soon we will see an update with some new content to it, I would gladly try it out. So yeah, I had some neat fun playing it, I totally recommend it and I really hope that my review was helpful to you!\n\nPersonal score\n7.5 / 10\nIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!","March 18","true","8.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Being a big fan of tower defense games I am always interested in games that try to do something new with the genre. Even though I haven't played the game a ton at this point, I have had fun with the game. The controls work well and if you think the concept sounds interesting, I think you will enjoy the game.\n\nMy biggest problem with My Tower, My Home is the difficulty and the fact that you will be replaying the same waves over and over again. While there are quite a few different strategies in the game, some seem to be better than others. Until you find one of these strategies you will die a lot. Being difficult is not necessarily a bad thing but it does force you to keep replaying the same content over and over again as you try to perfect your strategy. If you don't like the idea of playing the same level over and over again, the game may frustrate you.\n\nOverall I had fun with My Tower, My Home. I liked the combination of the 2D action shooter and tower defense genres. If the premise sounds really interesting to you I think you could like My Tower, My Home quite a bit. If you are only curious about the concept though I would probably wait for a sale.\n\nNote: I received a review copy from the developer but received no other compensation for this review.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","March 16","true","1.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

As interesting as that sounds I’ll skip right to the punch with this one. This game was a bit of a disappointment. While there are some redeeming traits to this title my initial and lasting reaction can easily be summarized in a single word; incomplete.\n\nIn this game you have a tower and must defend it and as the player you control a guy with a gun who can run, jump, shoot baddies and build upgrades for your tower.The game does provide some depth, though it feels as though the developers didn’t go as deep as they should have in some areas. For instance, there is a level system that allows players to selectively upgrade various skills and bonuses to help as the game progresses. It would have been nice had the developers expanded more in the part of the game as it seems like a step in the right direction.\n\nAs far as graphics are concerned, I found the visuals to be mediocre. Not the worst but not very impressive either.\n\nI was not overly impressed with the look and feel of the game’s UX. The menus and buttons were a bit clunky and unpolished looking. The turret placing process is sub-optimal and could be improved. Ugly fonts also. I'm very font sensitive.\n\nThe number one issue I have with this game is that it just doesn’t seem finished. Not only did it crash almost every time I played it, but it would crash in multiple ways. As a PC gamer I am willing to suffer a few game crashes here and there but there is a line between having a few ‘unhandled exceptions errors’ and having an unstable game. I found it especially frustrating because there were moments I was very ‘into’ the game and it would crash. Total buzz killer.\n\nWhile I cannot recommend this game in its current state I would encourage the developers not to abandon their efforts on this title. At its core there certainly is a good game here, but my end thoughts are that it needs more development to qualify as a good game entirely.\n\n5/10","April 13","false","9.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Though, not a lot is explained at first, after a couple of rounds you will be a pro. The game itself is super well made - plenty to upgrade, buy, and spend points on. The different graphic styles are spot on, super nice to look at. I very much enjoyed both defending my tower and setting up turrets to do it for me!\n","March 19","true","0.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I wanted to point this out because, sadly, it's not something to take for granted.\nSo, these guys did a fantastic job developing the game they wanted to develop, what I really don't get is why someone should want to develop this useless game in the first place! The world didn't need this! I'm sure I didn't! And i have to say i love tower defense games, so I knew what i was looking for.\nI mean, this game could be the "Pong" of the tower defense genre, just... even more boring!\n\nYou have a tower, literally, and you have to defend it, full stop.\nYou have a character and you use it in order to place turrets and shoot enemies, so it blends tower defense with shooter gameplay, but every single aspect of the gameplay is astonishingly basic!\nThis game has no charisma, there's no setup, no plot, nothing, you start the game and BAM, you are in your useless tower and you have to defend it! Why? I don't know!\nBut that's not a problem, right? A game like this doesn't necessarily need a plot, a setting, or even a flavour... but maybe some different game scenarios would be fun... Nope! You've been a bad boy and you got nothing! Just a silly tower and bunches of enemies which come to destroy your ugly tower and kill you. WHY? Because they're bad! - i mean there are scorpionlike bots, they cannot be good! - So you kill'em, you clear the wave, you open the shop interface where you can buy turrets, upgrade your hero, unlock skills, then the next wave attacks you, you clear it, upgrade, shop, next wave, and so on! There are just a few types of different enemies, so surviving means just to face bigger waves in the same situation and scenario. Again and again. This is insanely boring!\n\nIt's even a roguelite game, so when you die you have to restart the game with nothing unlocked, no progession, nothing, and i love roguelites but here it's just silly because the game is always the same boring thing with no variation!\n\nConclusions:If this game had been an arcade game back in the eighties, they would have need to actually pay people in order to have them play this.\nThis is ultimately a bad tower defense with a basic and boring shooter gameplay where you can play a single dull scenario.\nI wouldn't reccomend it even if it was free, there's no reason to waste time playing this instead of something else, or... just keep staring at this review it will be more entertaining!","March 16","false","0.8"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","50","12","24","7","1"
