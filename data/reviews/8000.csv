"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SavageBeastZero/recommended/8000/","SavageBeastZero","SavageBeastZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SavageBeastZero/","609 products in account","Introduction: Tomb Raider Anniversary is a love letter to the fans of the original game who for many years saw a decline is the quality of titles being released for the franchise being developed by it's creators CORE. This is the second title developed by Crystal Dynamics, who were given the task to return the series to it's once respected and celebrated roots atop the action adventure genre and they not only accepted this great challenge but, as we all now know have continued to exceed gamers expectations as to what's to come from our most eye pleasing raider of tombs. If you truly wish to see exactly how the series progressed to what is now considered by many as the only franchise able to challenge and possibly best the Unchartered series as reigning action adventure royalty, Tomb Raider Anniversay although the second title released by Crystal Dynamics is where the evolution of their titles truly began.\n\nOverview: Tomb Raider Anniversary is a remake of the original classic game released on the Sega Saturn, Sony Playstation and PC. Now many years after the originals release, it not only began to show it's age but, seem more like the grandmother of gaming instead of it's symbol of female stregnth, resolve and sexuality. Crystal Dynamics has returned our once royalty of the action adventure gaming scene to her original glory by completely overhauling the graphics and gameplay for the modern age. They have successfully retained the gameplay elements of the original all while enabling the player with a more fluid and responsive control scheme for combat and navigation.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay of Tomb Raider Anniversay is a blend of the previous entries with a more modernized execution. Gone are the tank like controls of the original which are now replaced with a scheme more suitable for a three dimensional space. The player will now be able to comfortably navigate our protagonost Lara through her adventures with a fair amount of ease and grace. Traversing areas overall feels much more natural than before as you perform platform jumps and general movements (combat etc.) throughout each level. With that being said, there are some areas which you will encounter less fluidity such as the under water sections which, in comparison to her ground level areas seem much less intuitive and a less than perfect camera that can at times make the journey a bit frustrating yet, even with it's flaws won't ruin the experience.\n\nThe puzzle aspect of the gameplay is kept fully intact retaning the original elements that many considered the series stregnth and are executed on a much more professional scale than the 1996 release. With the change to a more intuitive control scheme comes less headaches when trying to place objects in their necessary positions along with a free camera which will assist you in getting a better look at the challenge at hand. The puzzles are of increasing difficulty and can at times seem like a daunting affair which only heightens the experience. As you solve the puzzles, you will marvel at the the genius displayed by the develpers and see why this game is considered such a figurehead in the industry. It's this very element that Tomb Raider Anniversary displays time and time again throughout your adventure that makes it easily understandable once again why Lara Croft and the Tomb Raider Series are considered one of the most influential games created.\n\nGraphics: Crystal Dynamics has done a fantastic job at bringing the original Tomb Raider into the modern gaming age. The entire world that you may or may not remember from 1996 has been painstakingly recreated with surprisingly beautiful results. Although anniversary saw it's initial pc release in 2006 the graphics are still something to behold. The indoor environments specifically can at times leave you in awe and shock that this was now released nearly ten years ago. Developed on a modified Legend engine which was first seen in the 2005 release Tomb Raider Legend, Crystal Dynamics have displayed their knowledge gained and applied it masterfully within their newly crafted world.\n\nThere are a variety of features found in the graphics options to suit the pc gamers taste and configurations. From resolutions of up to 1080p, multiple aspects ratios and an assortment of graphics features such as anisotrpic filtering, multiple AA, shadows etc., Tomb Raider fans can rejoice that their title will remain relevant and playable for years to come. The only feature lacking which, oddly enough was found in Crystal Dynamics initial title Tomb Raider: Legend released in 2005 is an option to turn on high end graphics effects. Why they chose to limit the options available are beyond me but, regardless even without these, it still remains a beautifully constructed world.\n\nSound: Within the first few seconds of launching anniversary, you will be welcomed back by the easily recognized soundtrack of the original remastered. For gamers who had the privilage of playing the original 1996 title, this will immediately send a chill down your spine and emit feelings of generations past. I immediately felt like a child again upon hearing the woodwind instrument solo echoing during the intro and it set the stage for an incredible adventure to come. The sountrack found within anniversary is perfectly suited to eash sequence at any gven time during your adventure and a stregnth at every turn. The sound effects serve their intended purpose and are general standard fair. The only sounds a bit lacking are during gun fire which, show their age in comarison to more current titles. They simply lack an ability to give the player a sense of power while weilding the many firearms found in game.\n\nStory: In Tomb Raider Anniversary you play as the protagonist Lara Croft, an archeologist and adventurer whos beauty and athletic grace is matched by her intellectual abilities which, serve her well whilst traversing the many dangerous ruins found across the world. The story takes a back seat to the gameplay aspects but, serves the game well. It establishes a sense of purpose and creates a nice sense of pacing to ensure you continue further into your adventure without feeling forced. Simply put, the gameplay is just as much of the story as any dialogue found within it as any true action adventure game should be. Balanced and not overbearing, it exists and knows it's role at all times.\n\nReplay Value: The replay value of anniversay is all dependant of the player. There are many hidden artifacts to discover if you wish to let your inner completionist enjoy a bit of obsessive compulsiveness during your adventure. There's quite a bit to discover along the way and overall it's a fairly legnthly adventure. That being said, like any action adventure title, there are some that will get more out of it than others and that all depends on what you're looking to achieve within the game. Although there is a seperate standalone mini-adventure that extends the content, what it adds isn't really geared towards the standard player and the gameplay found within it is mostly puzzle based. So overall the replay value found here is moderate but, most definitely worth the asking price.\n\nFinal Review Score: 8.1/10 After being passed the torch, Crystal Dynamics successfully resurrected a franchise that was quickly being destroyed by it's creators CORE. In Tomb Raider Anniversary, Crystal Dynamics re-established the series as a viable contender for the action adventure crown and have done so since this 2006 release time and time again. Although Tomb Raider Anniversay isn't the incredibly polished title the most recently released Tomb Raider (2013) reboot was, it is very much so a classic example of how a remake can be achieved successfully without alienating it's fan base. If you're a fan of the action adventure genre, Tomb Raider Anniversary absolutely deserves a place in your library.","October 28, 2014","true","8.7"," 85 of 87 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","85","87","0","18"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yshganoth/recommended/8000/","yshganoth","Nyarlathotep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yshganoth/","298 products in account","I need to start with the the bad first, because while not changing the fact that I definitely recommend this game, I feel it really needs to be stated.\n\nThe bad aspects of this game really come down to one thing: it makes too many assumptions on what you are trying to do VS what you should do.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nThe bad\nYou can say what you want about the original, requiring quite a bit of precision with its blocky walls and ledges, as most of the moving around was made by jumping and grabbing ledges that were always facing each other. But it was clear when and where to jump to and from. The game knew what it did, and didn't make any assumptions of any kind on what you were trying to do. When you died, it was entirely your fault and your fault only.\n\nThe Anniversary edition has gone beyond that and allows you to grab onto a ledge while jumping from another perpendicular ledge. While this is welcome and freshens up the game feel most of the time, it gets tiring when the game does not agree on your trajectory and lets Lara fall off to her doom without having her trying to grab said ledge. Next time, you try an identical jump and surprisingly the game now agrees to it.\n\nThis is but an example. Overall, what happens is that the game does not allow you to do things it is not expecting. The most infuriating aspect of this is when the game decides wrongfully what is allowed and what isn't.\n\nYou can reach that pole from where you stand? Lara won't grab it because you are expected to pull that cage over there to be able to reach that ledge over there that will in turn allow you to grab the pole.\n\nThis leads to some really cringe-worthy moments were you will fail sequentially until the game finally decides to let you do what you actually are trying to do.\n\nFinally, and this is more of a detail, but still thought I'd mention it.\n\nRemember that animation in the original, when Lara lands on her feet and hands when she falls off a high platform? That is an animation that tells you "this is as high I can fall from" and you're like, "phew, that was close". You could really feel that fall through Lara.\n\nIn Anniversary, Lara falls off, lands on her two feet like nothing happened physically, still yells and loses some health, but that animation is not there anymore. Tough falls do not feel like tough falls (except those you die in). Too bad.\n\nThe good\nAll of this being said, this remake of the first Tomb Raider is everything a remake ought to be: it freshens up the original with new ideas and does not try too hard to be like its predecessor.\n\nNew graphics (2007-wise, but still look good in early 2015) and environments. If the sensation of vastness was there in the original, Anniversary builds on top of that and adds a more detailed architecture that improves that sensation of vastness.\n\nNew controls that use the gamepad perfectly (don't know about keyboard, playing with a xbox 360 controller).\n\nNew combat system that works way better than the original's jumping around. You still jump around here, it is just more dynamic overall. Even though combat is not frequent, there are enough to break the slow going pace of the puzzle solving. Also, boss fights! That means you have to find that specific thing to do to beat them.\n\nNew cutscenes, cinematics and new voice acting. Some cutscenes have QTEs, but this remains very rare and anecdotal and does not add much to the game except giving you the impression of control when Lara does some badass stuff on screen.\n\nCollectibles that will have you rummage through the levels if you want to get all of them. These unlock rewards such as new costumes, artworks, developer commentaries, etc. There is also a time trial mode in which you must complete a level in one go, without checkpoints or anything: you fail, you restart entirely.\n\nSome of the old puzzles have been replaced by new ones, but old ones that worked well have been kept. In the original I sometimes found myself wandering aimlessly until I eventually came across all the pieces needed to solve a puzzle. I never felt that in Anniversary. It was almost always a straightforward but still rewarding experience.\n\nIn addition to the ability to jump to perpendicular ledge, there are other new gameplay elements such as a grappling hook, swinging poles and climbable poles, all of which open up new possibilities for exploration and puzzle solving.\n\nI played Anniversary along with the original to fully appreciate the differences, and in my opinion, Anniversary is a great reverence to the original. It stands out on its own, with fresh ideas that definitely make sense for a game like this, while not casting any shadow over the original which has its own merits over Anniversary.","February 7, 2015","true","12.7"," 49 of 53 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","49","53","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/polly_s_hate/recommended/8000/","polly_s_hate","Polly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/polly_s_hate/","407 products in account","Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a solid re-imagining of the original game which makes use of the Tomb Raider: Legend engine, meaning a game that's much more user-friendly and playable control-wise, and of course packs quite the graphical upgrade.\n\nControlling Lara is a breeze with her acrobatics and various feats of parkour coming out smoothly and naturally whether using a gamepad or keyboard and mouse.  This makes the fact that a good 70-80% of the game is straight platforming and puzzle solving all the more enjoyable.  A keen eye and critical thinking are required to leap, grab, and grappling hook your way out of each scenario, and the game has a fairly generous system in place to help guide Lara to platforms, but most of the work is still up to the player.\n\nThe only real downsides of this remake are the combat and sometimes dodgy camera control and how that can interfere with some late-game platforming segments.  Combat in general feels very mushy. Gunplay never really felt satisfying, though the lock-on and shoot mechanic does help smooth things out a bit.  Issues arise however when enemies are able to get close, and especially if they're enemies capable of flight. The camera really loses track of what to do and can often cause a lot of seemingly unfair damage to be taken because of the obstruction.\n\nThe camera particularly fails in one of the final areas of the game (The Great Pyramid), where a long series of timed jumps are required to proceed. The camera gets positioned in ways that obstruct the path and you may find yourself making blind leaps and grappling hook attempts in vain. Even worse is that movement can end up completely fudged in this sequence since the controls are relative to what the camera is doing and leaps and grabs you were capable of earlier in the game suddenly have to be performed with different or nonsensical button combinations because the camera hasn't decided what forward and backward are or hasn't communicated it properly.\n\nEven with its faults though, this is a fantastic puzzle platformer with a silly as all hell story and some great locations to parkour around in.","June 23, 2015","true","21.5"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","32","34","3","0"

But it also means you'll be solving interesting though not always intuitive puzzles while listening to soothing soundtracks and all at the same time admiring Lara's ridiculous buxom.\n\nIf you are fond of TR Legend, Anniversary may intimidate you with its significantly more challenging combat and puzzles.  If the original TR I II and III were your cup of tea, however, Anniversary is your game.\n\n\nPROS:\n- Beautiful, glitch-free graphics.  Game looks "next-gen" without suffering from the fps drop or freezes that haunted Legend.\n- Wonderful sound effects and background music.\n- Fluid, precise control that inspires confidence.\n- Varied locations, each with its unique settings.\n- Top notch cutscenes with lots of emotions of Lara showing her exact thoughts of the moment.\n\nCONS:\n- Trial-n-errors, TR's staple feature, is worsened by the check point saving system.\n- Solutions to certain puzzles may not be immediately apparent; this leads to potential backtracking and wasted trips.\n- Old-fashioned, non-streamlined inventory system that requires arrow keys, TAB and Esc key to cycle through.\n- Significant hike in difficulty of last level.  I must have died more times in that level than previous levels combined.\n\n\nAll in all, in the books of a old time gamer who had immense fun and even great frustrations over 90's TR games, Anniversary delivers a truthful TR experience.

There is also a good variety of scenarios and their puzzles, which contribute to not become a repetitive and predictable game.

Oh man, Tomb Raider. I remember 1996. I bought a Voodoo graphics accelerator to make a Lara that was basically three cubes into a Lara that was basically three smoother cubes.

Right up to Tomb Raider 3 you could actually argue that despite the hype, despite the always growing bust, despite the recycling, Tomb Raider was a great game.

It's more focussed on exploration, carefully timed jumps and feverish backtracking to get that last bonus idol for your collection than Legend, where gunfights started three minuted into the game.

I also recommend for those seasoned players who have not picked this one up yet. it is by far my favorite in the series, competing close with Last Revelation.\n\nWhy do i recommend this to Newbies? It has all the basic mechanics and puzzles at an easy starting level for everyone. It throws you into the action with an easy and slow first level. the puzzles are simple, such as moving blocks, and gets slightly harder from there. The other games get harder from there.\n\nWhy do i recommend this to Fanboys? it recreates the original in a very casual environment, with beautiful new textures. it does not need to be challenging because, quite frankly we beat the game in 1996. For those who would find this easy, think of it as a refurbished museum to a historical game.\n\nThe game is just the right length to not become boring and tedious, which is always a plus. You will visit Peru, Greece, Egypt, and the City of Atlantis in this exciting adventure. There are only 4 Weapons, but its ok, combat is not the focus here. There are annoying Quick Time Events, but they are short and maybe only 4 or 5 encounters within the entire game. Puzzles are fun, and will make perfect sense once you figure them out. There are plenty of costumes to unlock, paying homage to outfits lara has worn in the past.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErickaUnlimited/recommended/8000/","ErickaUnlimited","💝💝ErickaUnlimited💝💝","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErickaUnlimited/","777 products in account","Overview\nTom Raider: Anniversary is a remaster of one of my favorite games of all time, the original Tomb Raider for the original Playstation console. This remastered version holds onto the original story, levels (with a few added areas) and idea that made Tomb Raider such a great game. With a new graphics engine and an overhaul to the controls, Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a nice step up from its predecessor, though it does fall flat on a few areas too. Let's have a look:\n\nFor those that have never played a Tomb Raider game before, Tomb Raider is a platforming, puzzle-based game with limited gunplay when enemies creatures/humans appear. Throughout the game, you'll face increasingly dangerous creatures, but very few human opponents. The game is centered around Lara and her environment, as opposed to human interaction. There is some, but it is limited to key points in the story.\n\nFor the game itself, you take control of Lara Croft, an archaeologist, adventurer, gun-slinger and overall badass. She's a globetrotter, exploring ancient worlds on her quest to recover three pieces of an artifact, known as the "Scion" and uncover the mystery of the lost city of Atlantis, among other secrets along the way.\n\nThe game's plot will take you to a multitude of dynamic environments, solving puzzles, dodging lethal traps and killing indigenous and unexpected foes along the way. Your arsenal is small, but effective, consisting of a few weapons (including your trusty dual pistols), some acrobatic flare and your wits. What I loved about the enemies was the blending of reality with fiction, giving the places you visit a mystic feeling, but still maintaining the core of its history in the places you visit.\n\nWhile I loved the remake with the added features, level areas and different puzzles, there were some flaws that I felt the first one did better. For those that played the first installment, and for those that did not, saving and health packs were limited, making every decision difficult and enemies a lot more dangerous. Saving involved maybe one or two blue "save crystals" found during the level, making death costly and keeping you on your toes throughout the level. In the remake, those are removed for a save option that can be initiated at anytime, which also "heals you" when you do so, making the game relatively easy and death a mere inconvenience instead of something to fear.\n\nHowever, combat has been improved and the controls have had a much needed overhaul from the original and the game still keeps hints to a minimum (usually none) making the need to explore, think and instill a bit of detective work in the player, which I always enjoyed (your experience may vary). Lara's acrobatics have been streamlined and platforming has become a little more forgiving, though it is still easy to die if you're not careful.\n\nThe remake also kept the side quests alive, leaving hidden artifacts to collect and health/ammo to those that seek them out, or for those of you who want more to do that just find the end of the level.\n\nWhen it comes to the remastered version, I greatly enjoyed it. It's filled with nostalgia with a hint of polish and finish. My only complaint lies with the severe lack of difficulty that the remastered version has over the original and how saves are handled and how plentiful ammo appears to be. With that being said, it is still a joy to play and I see myself doing multiple playthroughs.\n\nPros\nUpdated graphics engine, control overhaul and movement\nKeeps true to the original while adding its own flavor with new areas, puzzles and scenery.\nPuzzles - Seamless to the world around you, tricky and notably deadly. I love how the puzzles are introduced.\nMusic  - I've always been a fan of the music; the feelings that transpire from them are intense, yet pleasant.\nCons\nDifficulty - It has been scaled down tremendously, which I disliked.\nHealing - Saving the game heals Lara, which makes no sense. It makes health packs often useless.\nAmmo - It's plentiful. It's everywhere.\n\nOverall, Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a fun platformer for those who are new to the series or veterans. The upgrades are nice, though not always the best decision, but the game tries. It holds to the original while being new at the same time. I still recommend it despite the cons, as I feel the game is well worth the cost and the investment of your time.","April 1","true","12.5"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","4"

Dedicated exploration, optional puzzles, and a world and character worth looking at, and very playable to boot.\n\nI wonder why everyone turned their face at me when I mentioned how I loathe tomb raider because of the clunky movement control. They changed it, and now it is another entry to worthwhile platform games that everyone should give a try. You probably won't find everything on your first go, but taking a nice stroll through it and trying everything will do the trick, as well as  stump most normal platform gamers who think that everything that happens is accessible and valid instantly. Where that is not always the case here.\n\nI'll probably enjoy tomb raider games from here on for sure. Because I couldn't get enough of the older eidos platform games. And this is just tomb raider that moves just like the rest of those games. I couldn't be more pleased with that. As the rest of the game is or should be self explanatory.","September 4, 2014","true","18.6"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","19","24","0","2"

As a video gamer new to the franchise,  I can now fully understand the reasons behind the tremendous popularity of the Tomb Raider series and the fervor of its fan base.  The extent of my previous experience with the internationally celebrated Lara Croft amounted to about 20 minutes of game play on a roommate's Playstation back in the year 2000.  Thus, I had not been truly prepared for how fantastic a journey I would embark upon in Tomb Raider: Anniversary for PC on sale from Steam.\n\nPROS:\n\nArtistically, the four geographic settings are vibrant, colorful, and immersive.  Coupled with the wonderful music score, the sense of depth and immersion allows you to get lost in the game play and fully embrace the Lara Croft character and her story.  Architectural designs are fun, pleasing, and accurate to their respective time periods and cultures.\n\nCompared to other games, inventory control and weapon selection are perfectly adequate and simple without being unnecessarily clunky or unwieldly.  The same can be said of the combat and avatar movement controls.  This simplicity was a refreshing change for a gamer such as myself who has played much of the Assassin's Creed series and finds much of the combat and movement controls, as well as the overabundance of weapons, mostly superfluous.\n\nTomb Raider: Anniversary was a sincere challenge for me, and I found this splendidly refreshing in a sad era of dumbed-down video games, crafted with constant hand-holding, slap-in-the-face obviousness, and/or effortless boss fights.  Level puzzles in TR:A  required strategy and (oftentimes) foresight with a healthy dose of trial and error in their completion.  Pathing through the map required keen observation and a healthy (and often fatal) dose of trial and error as well.  Most combat engagements were harrowing (especially toward the end) and boss fights required a combination of skill, attentiveness, and diligence.  I cannot remember the last time a video game made my palms sweat as profusely as this title.\n\nCONS:\n\nOn the downside, I cannot remember the last time a video game spiked my blood pressure to such unhealthy levels either.  Three to four level sections were downright diabolical, if not cruel in the difficulty scale.  Even with the help of a walkthrough as a guide, some spots took me HOURS to complete. Once or twice this was due to poor checkpoint (save) placement or miscommunicated controls ("Jump LEFT Lara! Not backward into the bubbling sea of LAVA! GAHHHH!!"). But mostly it was due to timed climbing runs with way too little time and way too many stages of jumps and maneuvers, sometimes intermixed with combat.  Two boss fights in particular were frustrating to complete, even with guide help and when doing everything correctly.\n\nLastly, I was disappointed in the implementation of a few extraeneous game elements.  Gradually unlocked outfits for Lara could not be worn during the first play-through of the game.  The Croft Manor side-mission was especially enjoyable for me, but any progress could not be saved on the PC version, even after level completion.  It had to be solved on one go, and then the level reset itself upon future visits.  Admittedly, these cons are largely nit-picky, but I see no logical reason why the developers implemented these (otherwise fun) elements this way.\n\nOverall, Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a phenomenal video gaming experience offering MANY immersive and challenging hours of fun and thrills.  It's a true bargain at $10 or less, and was a sinful steal for me for under $2 bundled with the Tomb Raider Reboot.","March 1, 2015","true","40.6"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","0"

So, I was understandably excited in finding out an anniversary homage to the first game of the Core series, which crashed and burned after the embarrassing Angel of Darkness. And Tomb Raider Anniversary was (of course) the first game I ever played on Steam.\nSo, after 30 hours of gameplay (20 in the first run not on my profile, and about 10 in the second), I think I have a pretty accurate opinion about this game.\n\nFirst the pros:\n1) I found Lara’s movements incredibly smooth, and it was pretty easy to get used to them and do things a bit more quickly than in Legend.\n2) The beautiful, sometimes even breathtaking sceneries (and the fact that no spot of the areas was covered in darkness, no matter how far it was);\n3) Adaptations of the structure of the levels: while I could still easily orient myself (some paths are pretty much the same) many things changed to adapt to Lara’s new abilities, but it was done in a very natural way;\n4) Bossfights: I had fun during those. They aren’t a “just-shoot-until-it-dies” kind of bossfights, you actually have to use your brain. Which is awesome!\n\nAnd now, the cons:\n1) Bugs: There are bugs everywhere! You don’t know when the next one is gonna hit you in the face, and the more you are far from your last checkpoint, the more you get nervous, because: “What if she doesn’t grab that ledge, falls and dies, and I have to do it all over again?”. And that’s just one of many.\n2) Checkpoints: seriously, what the heck? I have no idea how they thought it would be a good idea to set the checkpoints the way they did: one after every lever, but not even one right before and/or right after a very difficult piece? Are you kidding me?!\n3) Pyramid ascending: the first time I ascended the Pyramid with that series of timed runs, I thought I was going to cry. It's difficult and that’s ok. What is NOT ok is that Lara points her guns at everything BUT the flying mummies (which, instead, do a very good job at killing her), or that she bugs and doesn’t grab what she must in order to finish that piece, thus wasting all of your efforts.\n4) Lara Croft: Now, thing is, while one may appreciate her being more human… She is not as I remember her in TR1. She was way more cold, and killed Natla’s lackeys without a care in the world. “What? You want to kill me? Over your dead body maybe!” or “My piece of the Scion? Not before you catch my bullets with your eye, honey!”. That was Lara’s attitude, and that way I liked her. But maybe I’m just grumpy because she was the strong, devil-may-care woman every little girl (me first in line) wanted to be…\n\nSo, did I like the game? Yes. Would Recommend it? Absolutely.\n\nBut take some Xanax first. Or morphine. Meditation is fine.\nWhatever relaxes you the most.\n\nAnd good luck.","December 23, 2015","true","11.9"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","14","17","4","7"

I've played the others by Crystal Dynamics and I'd place this with the gritty reboot as the best.\n\n\nTHE GOOD: Damn near everything!\nThe puzzles are actually puzzling, the platforming challenging, the dialogue and acting are actually good and the story gives Lara some surprising depth! The music hits both the atmospheric and action themes perfectly, and the game is more than its money's worth in terms of length (expect 20 - 40 hours). Oh and it still looks great in 2015!\nThere's tonnes of extra unlockable content included too, such as costumes, concept art and in-game commentary, and Croft Manor is a nice side-mission that you can play whenever you feel like taking a break from the main game.\n\n\nTHE BAD: Camera/control problems, A once-off lack of conveyance...\nThere are some rare problems with the controls (like holding forward to jump back and to the left? Wat??) and on modern computers there's sometimes a bug where Lara simply refuses to grab a ledge, but there are solutions out there if it's a problem for you.\nOf course, this is Tomb Raider so the camera will be your worst enemy at times, basically wrestling with you for control (especially when wall running) though in fairness it could be a lot worse --- 90% of the time you won't notice it, and 9% of the time it will zoom out to make everything look more epic.\n\nAlso, you might find yourself wanting to consult a walkthrough every now and then, but try checking Lara's journal first as it might have crucial information. I have to crticize the game here though, since during a particular battle there was literally no way I could have known what to do unless I stopped the game, opened the menu and read the journal --- only I forgot about the journal since I hadn't really needed until then. This only happened the one time though, so I can't say it's a deal breaker.\n\n\nTHE SCORE : 9/10\nThe problems are really very minor and don't detract too much from what I would consider an otherwise flawless game.\nHighly Recommended!\n\n\nNOTE:\nI played this on easy as the difficulty options just change the damage values. I don't mind taking lots of damage, but it's just an immersion breaker when I have to expend 100's of bullets to kill anything. So if you're like me, play it on easy. If you want an extra challenge, don't use medkits.","June 4, 2015","true","41.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

It's different to the show-off that was TR Legend. It's once again about Lara, being alone in this GIANT tomb, solving various puzzles and defeating various enemies on the way to get a priceless relic. As it should be. I think they got this isolated feeling from the original quite well.\nHowever, they decided to create their own little trilogy, focused on Lara and her daddy issues. CD shamelessly stuck this non sense into the original story and I will forever dislike them for that.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much the same like Legend's. There are many, many areas in which you have to jump away from a ledge and either:\n1. you can't turn the camera to see where you're jumping\n2. the camera sluggishly attempts to show you but instead spazzes out and you can't see ♥♥♥♥\n3. you somehow jump in the totally opposite direction\n4. you can't make it to the ledge despite jumping a similair distance minutes ago\n\nAll this makes a game full of ledge jumping really frustrating. A lot of times something looks like a ledge, but it isn't.\n\nThe level design is pretty good, but half of the credit goes to the original game, which had fantastic level ideas. What really sucks is that a lot of those super memorable rooms are usually connected with long ♥♥♥ empty hallways, that have like 3 repeating textures in the style of each level set.\n\nThe combat is okay, reminiscent of the old game as well. Although I'm not a big fan of that slow-mo bullet-time thing. Also QTEs, no need to have those in this game at all. Graphics are good for 2007, still keeping the cartoony feel of Legend.\n\nOverall a good remake, because its base was fantastic. Lots of unnecessary stuff added in though.","July 14, 2015","true","11.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","10","12","3","0"

It's a faithful re-imagining of the original Tomb Raider from 1996, while deftly tying it into the story of the other two games that take place in the present (it's still 1996 in this remake). Anniversary is visually beautifiul and the puzzles are incredibly elaborate and complex. Lara travels the globe to places like Peru, Greece, and Egypt, while you solve the mysteries of some of the most enormous and intricately designed tombs ever in a Tomb Raider game.\n\nThe story is a rehash of the original, with Lara hired by the mysterious Natla Corporation to find an artifact. What's good about it is the way they tied this into the back story about Lara's mother.\n\nThe only knock I can give is that on the pc there is a well-known bug in one of the Egypt levels that prevents you from making a simple jump to a ledge so you can exit the level. I had to download a cheat to let me move Lara past that point. Then there is the infamous "pyramid tower of terror" segment near the end which had me smashing my mouse and keyboard in frustration. Even watching You Tube videos and knowing exactly what to do, it still took dumb luck on one of the jump sequences to make it after about a hundred tries. The problem is that they made grapple wall running/jumping to the next handhold very unforgiving, and you are constantly fighting the camera angles and the controls to get Lara to do what you want her to do. It's hard enough to get enough momentum, jump from the right height and the exact right moment so you can barely reach the ledge, but then to have Lara jump back instead of to the side, or to the side instead of back, because according to the camera angle that's what the game thinks you want her to do...that can be maddening.\n\nDespite late game bugs/control issues, Anniversary is still a great game and very satisfying to finish.","January 1, 2015","true","38.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

That game focused on the strengths of the series--exotic locales, thoughtful puzzles, and incredible acrobatics--while modernizing the gameplay, as well as streamlining the whole experience. Crystal Dynamics continues its good work with Tomb Raider: Anniversary, which effectively goes back to the original Tomb Raider and rebuilds it from scratch. Anniversary has now arrived on the Xbox 360, looking as good and playing about as well as it did on the PC.\n\nThis is one of those rare cases when the remake is better than the original.\nLike the 1996 original, Tomb Raider: Anniversary follows the tale of Lara's hunt for the Scion of Atlantis as she does battle with conniving businesswoman Jacqueline Natlas and her various henchmen. You'll explore ancient tombs and forgotten cities in Peru, Greece, or Egypt. You'll also perform plenty of death-defying acrobatics as you work your way through massive, ancient, and often deadly puzzles. The whole experience is highly evocative of the original, and there are certainly plenty of moments that seem specifically designed to create an odd sense of déjà vu. Nothing in Tomb Raider: Anniversary has been regurgitated verbatim--everything is bigger and better. The environments are larger and more detailed, while existing puzzles have been elaborated upon, often to an incredible degree. The experience just feels bigger, and there's so much new content that it honestly feels more like its own game than a remake.\n\nA big part of that feeling comes from how much more talented Lara has become since the original Tomb Raider. Aside from a few, nominal differences, she's basically got the same abilities here as she had in Tomb Raider: Legend, which made her one of the most nimble action adventure heroes this side of the Prince of Persia. Her proficiency around ledges is incredible: She can shimmy across ledges, leap from one ledge to another, and scramble from one ledge to a higher ledge. She can swing from dangling ropes or horizontal bars, perform tumbling maneuvers to avoid projectiles, and climb up, leap from, or balance precariously atop vertical poles. All of these acrobatics feel natural and not overly difficult to pull off, with the game allowing for just the right amount of margin of error. As good as Lara is, though, she's got her limits, which is a big part of what makes the action feel dangerous. If your timing is off just a little bit when jumping for a ledge, Lara might catch it with only one hand, which will have you furiously mashing a button to help her recover. But if you miss the ledge completely, Lara's likely to expire or at least incur a serious amount of damage.\n\nShe'll need to exercise each and every one of these abilities to their absolute limit in Tomb Raider: Anniversary, which features no shortage of ridiculous acrobatics. The game is essentially made up of a series of gigantic, unique set-piece puzzles. Sometimes the puzzles are traditional find-the-key, flip-the-switch-type of affairs, but more often than not, the real puzzle is figuring out how to use Lara's ability to get from point A to point B. What's more, the puzzles are often nested several layers deep. While your overall goal may be to find four keys to open a door, you'll first have to figure out how to get to the bottom of a gigantic, crumbling tower. After getting to the bottom, you'll have to figure out how to access four different doors. Then, after accessing the doors, you'll have to figure out how to actually open those doors. Of course, behind each of those doors lies a series of tricks and traps that you'll have to traverse before you'll get to the keys. Solving one of these overarching puzzles can be an involved process, with some of them taking well over an hour to complete.\n\nThe environments are your biggest adversaries most of the time in Anniversary, though through your exploration, you'll regularly run into some antagonistic fauna, such as rats, bats, wolves, bears, tigers, gorillas, raptors, and the occasional Tyrannosaurus Rex. Combat is limited to gunplay, which operates with a simple lock-on system. Lara can also tumble and flip through the air while keeping a bead on an enemy. New to Anniversary is the adrenaline dodge, which at specific moments allows Lara to dodge a charging enemy in slow motion. When time slows, a target will also slowly move toward the enemy, and if you fire the weapon right at the moment it locks on, it'll produce an instant kill, usually when the ferocious beast is just inches away from your face. It still feels like Tomb Raider combat, which has always been a minor part of the experience, but the adrenaline dodge is a nice little touch that adds a little more drama to the action. Tomb Raider: Anniversary also makes use of the same type of interactive cutscenes seen in Tomb Raider: Legend, where you'll have to quickly react to an onscreen button cue to keep Lara alive. It allows for some beautifully choreographed action sequences, but they're rarely very challenging.\n\nWhat keeps Tomb Raider: Anniversary engaging throughout is the strength of the gameplay, as well as the quality of the presentation. Even though you're basically just going from one tomb to another, they feature enough individual detail to make them unique. The environments are also huge, using the occasional curvy hallway to mask load times, and aside from some minor gameplay contrivances, they feel pretty real. Lara looks great and moves with a natural grace that makes her incredible acrobatic feats look feasible instead of ridiculously superhuman. The various wildlife creatures you confront also move convincingly. It's the little touches that bring the whole thing together: the way water glistens on Lara's skin when she gets out of the water, the way light refracts differently when she's underwater, or the tangible difference in atmosphere between different locales.\n\nIt's almost enough to make you forget about Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness.\nIn the months from the initial release of Tomb Raider: Anniversary on the PC and PS2 to its arrival on the Xbox 360, Crystal Dynamics appears to have done little, if anything, to change the experience. The graphics are on par with the PC version, though we did notice a few, isolated instances of frame rate chop, despite the fact that there's nothing in here that should be taxing the 360 hardware for that to occur. The environments might not always be rich with detail, but Lara looks consistently great. It's also a really great-sounding game. You'll hear plenty of small ambient effects, such as animal calls and dripping water. Lara's grunts and yelps as she scales these incredible antiquities will also resonate differently depending on the size of the room. Music is generally used sparingly, but it always swells to a flourish at all the right moments.\n\nTomb Raider: Legend did a lot to make Lara Croft feel relevant again, and Tomb Raider: Anniversary is another step in the right direction. The acrobatic action is consistently exciting and challenging throughout. Yet despite being a remake, the experience feels new and fresh. This is the best Tomb Raider game in years, and for the first time in a long time, that actually means something.\n\nTHE GOOD\nStrikes a balance between homage and new, exciting content\nAcrobatic action adventure gameplay is challenging without being frustrating\nLara looks great and moves effortlessly\nAdrenaline dodge makes combat more exciting\n\nTHE BAD\nDoesn't take many chances with the Tomb Raider formula\nMinor frame rate issues\n7.5/10\nGOOD","April 23","true","3.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

It's very similar to the original game with a few things tweaked or added. Still has a decent sound track and some tense platforming. Controls are sooooo much smoother than the older games.

Tomb Raider Anniversary, for already being over 5 years old, looks quite excellent, has a series-typical great soundtrack, and is generally a greatly superior rendition of the concept of Tomb Raider than was the original.\n\nHowever, the difficulty and controls can be genuinely unmanageable at times, particularly in the last half of the game. Also of note is the poor edge detection that persists throughout the game and the penchant for getting stuck on the vertexes of things that both Lara and many of the creatures have (see the T-Rex fight for example).","November 13, 2012","true","22.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If the original TR I II and III were your liking however, Anniversary is your game.\n\n\nPROS:\n- Beautiful, clean graphics. Game looks "next-gen" without suffering from the fps drop or freezes that haunted Legend.\n- Wonderful sound effects and background music.\n- Fluid, precise control that inspires confidence.\n- Varied locations, each with its unique settings.\n- Top notch cutscenes with lots of emotions of Lara showing her exact thoughts of the moment.\n- Its not a high demanding game. If you have an older laptop that is having trouble playing old games like Team Fortress 2 this will run way better.\n\nCONS:\n- Horrible checkpoint system. There is plenty of rooms in this game that you will spend 5-10 min that will restart if you die.\n- Hints are subpar for this game when it comes to puzzles; this leads to potential backtracking and wasted trips.\n- Old-fashioned, non-streamlined inventory system that requires arrow keys, TAB and Esc key to cycle through.\n- Random difficulty spikes in some of the levels make this game harder than other Tomb Raiders like TR Underworld.\n- There are a couple of rare glitches that occur for some people that has Lara unable to grab a ledge that's needed to be grabbed to progress the story. You will have to exit out to start menu to fix.\n\n\n\nFor a 2007 remake this game was immense fun and even great frustrations over 90's TR games, Anniversary delivers a truthful TR experience. It's challenging, but equally rewarding. Even if you already beat the original a handful of time back in the day I can still safely recommend it.","May 14","true","27.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is very completely new for me, and since my PC woudln't want to run the original games, I got stuck staring out with it's Anniversary remake. So until I get a Sony Playstation, here is my review~\n\nStory/Presentation: 7The story was really bland, to be honest. I wasn't looking anything too crazy like Indiana Jones style, but seeing as how popular Lara Croft is in the gaming community, I expected more of a good story to come out of this. If this was just fo the story, I would of given it a lower score, specially from it's awkward animation in the cutscenes. For it being an HQ remake, I expected a little bit more, it even makes the Twin Snakes remake of Metal Gear Solid look Amazing. But the reason it got a higher score was from it's gameplay atmosphere. The tombs themselves, the outdoor life, and even when she comes out of the water, her clothes actually look wet, and I personally thought that was impressive. Nothing out of this world, but it really is lovely to look at, even from it's time of release.\n\nGameplay: 8Now the gameplay itself was a Lot of fun, I remember. I can see why people do like this game. It's no the story, it's the movement, and the puzzles within the game. It was told that old and new puzzles were made for this remake, and I thought they were all fun and challenging. Even Lara's movements are great in the game, with such manuevers like rolling, running, spinning while rolling, swinging, climbing, and my favorite, swan diving. The only issue I had was that sometimes when you jump and reach for something to hold unto, the game won't read it and makes you fall down and do it again. There were times when I would jump towards a rope and she woudln't even try to reach it and she'll just jump through it, and it irritated me a bit.\n\nOverall: 8It's not the best game in the world, but it's not bad, either. I had a lot of fun and memories with this game, and I personally can't wait to try out the original. It's short, it's fun, and I would recommend it for anybody who's a puzzle lover who doesn't mind a bit of shooting here and there.","August 11, 2014","true","13.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

A BIG IF.  If you have the patience of Buddha then you can consider playing this game.  Know that it will torment you to the point where you want to smash your pc to pieces.  This game could be used as a means of punishing criminals.\nThis is a reboot of the first Tomb Raider, a true classic and a game I loved.  Obviously the graphics is much better.  The level layout and controls have also been updated.\n\nThe good:\n1. This is a true Tomb Raider game where it is mostly about Lara vs the environment.  It's not like Tomb Raider 2013 where there is an enemy or ten behind every corner.\n2. I am glad the levels have been redesigned.  It sort of works.  Maybe it is just memory but they do feel dumbed down a bit though.\n3. Even though this game is some 7 years old the scenery looks really great.  Character models and textures are nothing like modern games though.\n4. You can take selfies of Lara as she roams ancient locations.\n\nThe Bad:\n5. The controls.  The original Tomb Raider was genius with its minimalist controls.  The reboot does not emulate it unfortunately.  On the original you could jump forward, to one side, backwards and to the other side an infinite number of times and Lara would end up exactly where she started.  Forget about it with the reboot.  The introduction of the mouse changed a lot.\n6. Related to the above point, in the original you could control Lara very accurately.  She'd jump when you press jump; do front and back somersaults at will; jump at exactly the end of ledge or slide.  No more.  You get used to ledges but slides are atrocious.\n7. How difficult could it have been to keep an autosave that the player can load at will?  You have to manually save after each check point.  No matter where you save, you reload at the last checkpoint.\n\nThe ugly:\n8. The two major additions the game, the grapple and timed dodge and shoot are the worst though.  Even after completing the game I have no confidence that I can get any of these two right at will.  Lara's responses seems very random to the input you give.  The shoot dodge works ok if you face only one enemy but when there are more - good luck.  The grapple though is what really gets me.\n9. It feels like the game developers thought how they can make the world a little worse place to live?  Hehehe... lets make a really nice game with a bug witch acts up randomly at critical times.  The grapple is perfect for this.  When the player press jump to side we make Lara jump perpendicular and vice versa but remember only at some random critical times.\n10. The make matters worse the checkpoints seems to come just after a long sequence of activities punctuated with one of these random grapples at the end.  Possibly half of my game time was doing bits over and over and over again until Lara did what I instructed.\n11. Lara's Mansion introduction mission.  I owned this game for many years but only now played it.  Each time I would start with the introduction and then stop playing because it would irritate the living daylights out of me.\n\nI recommend this game with big reservations.  After playing I think that if the developers took the original and only gave it a new coat the game would have been infinitely better.\nThis game is 95% good and 5% bad.  A pity the 5% bad takes up 50% of your playtime.  Really consider playing the original in stead.","June 24, 2014","true","24.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

You love that woman, but you can’t take it no more. Its like you didn’t choose to love her, but to love her you have been chosen.\n\nNow lets get into it,\n\nSTORY: The story is not that deep, but surly the places in the game are, for some reasons the atmosphere of the environment tells you more about the game than the scenario that was put in the story line. If you didnt  or even did play the original Tomb Raide, this is it just in HD.\n\nGAMEPLAY The gameplay surly better than the previous games, you can feel it, the new you era impacted Tomb Raider in a great way and it didn’t lose the flavor of Lara two-guns style adventurer puzzle game. One thing for sure, since I’m reviewing the PC version of this game I’d recommend playing with a controller! Seriously, its frustrating to play with\out one still, but its surly better than playing it with the keyboard I promise you!  Oh yes, did I mention that the game is frustrating?! I mean you try to do a single jump based on four to six jumps ahead, and that jump is so hard that you take a lot of time to get it right and when that happens!! When that happen you get that feeling of satisfaction “Ohhhh shiitt!!! I’ve done it! AT LAST!! AHHH!!” that’s basically why I kept playing for till this point (this review).\n\nGRAPHICS: As much as I don’t care about graphics, I do. In this game graphics plays a great job of showing you a great environment, not the best, but surly great.  I got to mention that, its always a good idea to take a look around you when in a new place. Additionally, there is Lara, she’s a beauty and she might be one of greatest reasons that anyone will play this game and I got to admit they did a great job fixing up her body!\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Should I think of playing this game? YES! Should I buy it? YES, its not that expensive and its great, it will surly keep you satisfied for a while.\n","December 7, 2015","true","14.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has aged terribly.\nThe graphics are laughably blocky (let's face it, even for its time, Tomb Raider wasn't pretty) and we've got those terrible, muddy, low-res textures... but beyond the superficial cosmetic stuff, there's the unrefined gameplay and ESPECIALLY shoddy controls.\nIf you want the authentic retro experience, you can get the original here on Steam...\n\nAs a series continues, it is refined. The developers get a handle on what was good; what worked; what didn't... they can learn and grow.\nTomb Raider: Anniversary is putting the lessons you've learned over time into practice and fixing your mistakes.\nTomb Raider: Anniversary is the original, only better in every way.\nVisually improved, of course, but VASTLY superior mechanically, and with respect to the controls.\n\nWhat hasn't changed, is Lara's bizarre choice of a tank top and short-shorts for a snowy expedition.\nI'll accept that she wants to wear that for manoeuvrability, fashion, and/or for hot weather. There's nothing wrong with that. But good gods is it inappropriate for a bloody blizzard!\nSo, poor Lara is sexualised and objectified, but she is still one of gaming's most badass leading ladies; basically "lady Indiana Jones," which is probably one of the most awesome things ever.\n\nIf you're looking to experience the franchise's story, this is going to be a better entry-point than the PS1-era classic.","December 25, 2014","true","7.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The control is accurate enough that you can do precision maneouvers cleanly and without glitch frustration, and the puzzles are genuinely enjoyable, pitched at pretty much the right level - not so hard you give up, but difficult enough you can experience a feeling of achievement when you figure something out.\n\nUnlike some I quite enjoy the new version of TR also - I enjoy story-heavy gaming and I like bleeding-edge graphics so I'm all there. But the original TR games really were there own thing, something that was clear from sales at the time presumably but is even mroe apparent I feel with the passage of time. I really can't think of many other 'puzzle platformer' titles which worked so successfuly in 3d.

Back in 2006 when this game came out I did not hesitate to get it, the same happened ten years later when it went on sale.\n\nI was a bit cautious at first as I couldn't exactly remember what the game was like on the PS2 and what with all the negative reviews regarding camera angles and controls, I was scared this was going to be a terrible port.\n\nHaving completed the game, story wise that is, I can say that, yes whilst the camera angles are sometimes terrible, I can't deny that I've actually had SO much fun with this game.\n\nPros:\nThe Soundtrack is actually in this one\nCombat is fast and tense in some cases, especially on smaller platforms in later levels\nLong but not at all tedious puzzles\nAtmosphere is pretty damn good for a game that's roughly a decade old\nGraphics ain't too bad either, few bits of clipping here and there but nothing major.\nSome boss battles are Brilliant!\nSome redesigns of enemies made them signifcantly cooler without them feeling too different (Centaurs, Pierre, Larson)\nReplayability through difficulties, timed runs and searching for artifacts and relics.\nDangerous areas and climbing puzzles lead to tense jumps a sense of urgency (Saw Blade traps in Egypt)\n\nCons:\nThe Grapple becomes necessary to pass levels and the controls for which can actually be very difficult\nSome of the later levels don't look or even resemble the original levels in Tomb Raider 1 (1996) (Lost Island Levels)\nSome of the puzzles were altered and in the case of St. Francis' Folly, a complete different direction has to be taken to get to a certain area, removing the nostalgia of the level.\nThe Boss A.I can be freaking awful (T-Rex and Torso Boss getting stuck on a corner)\nSome of the redesigns of enemies cause them to look completely different (Mummies, Mutants and Flying Mutants)\nThe Second to last level causing me to have a brain haemorrage because of the jumping platforms and grapple hooks ffs.\nBugs regarding ledges and combat\n\nI mean the grappling is a serious issue in the game and so can the camera angles. Controls are odd to start with but by the fourth level you will have already pretty much gotten the hang of them. The cheats you unlock later on for completing time trials make the game both easier and a lot more fun. If you're in it for the story or the nostalgia then get it, but don't expect too much from it if you've not played Tomb Raider before, as a matter of fact, if you HAVEN'T played Tomb Raider before, give the first game a go, then you might be able to appreciate the work put into this version of it.\nFrom the time racked up on PS2 and on steam, this game is defo worth at least a gander at.","March 19","true","17.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I, myself, have all the games and I am working on completing all of them. This one is a remake of the first one with alittle bit extra added, and I am glad they remade Lara because the first one was godly. Of course though, to all games there are pros and most definitly cons so lets jump right into that!\n\nPROS!!!\nThe game has beautiful senery that you can get lost in which is a lovely touch. Going from a ruined city to a thick rain forest is amazing.\nThe fighting in the game is simple and fun, having a feature to slow down time and jump over enemies and such is also an amazing aspect.\nThe puzzles in this game are fantastic, from little contraptions to huge doors that have to be opened quickly and as you run for the door breathing hard.\nThe climbing is great, you have a grappling hook, and of course your hands to go around the amazing senery and get to new places that could possibly hold relics and such.\n\nCONS!!!\nThe AI can be a bit derpy, but I only ran into that maybe 1 or twice.\nThis isnt really a con, but at some points I got confused where to go and fell and died alot at the same part.\nThe game has some crazy plot twist that are hard to follow if your one of those people who skip every cutscene.\n\n\nSo if I were to give with from a 0 to a 10 I'd give it a definite 9 because I love the Tomb Raider games and I love the art style to them. Of course the game has its bugs and issues like sometimes you might now be able to grapple and you fall, but it is always fun and never get bored or tired. Its also pretty fun to speed through and collect all the costumes.\n\n","March 26","true","35.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You love that woman, but you can’t take it no more. Its like you didn’t choose to love her, but to love her you have been chosen.\n\nNow lets get into it,\n\nSTORY: The story is not that deep, but surly the places in the game are, for some reasons the atmosphere of the environment tells you more about the game than the scenario that was put in the story line. If you didnt  or even did play the original Tomb Raide, this is it just in HD.\n\nGAMEPLAY The gameplay surly better than the previous games, you can feel it, the new you era impacted Tomb Raider in a great way and it didn’t lose the flavor of Lara two-guns style adventurer puzzle game. One thing for sure, since I’m reviewing the PC version of this game I’d recommend playing with a controller! Seriously, its frustrating to play with\out one still, but its surly better than playing it with the keyboard I promise you!  Oh yes, did I mention that the game is frustrating?! I mean you try to do a single jump based on four to six jumps ahead, and that jump is so hard that you take a lot of time to get it right and when that happens!! When that happen you get that feeling of satisfaction “Ohhhh shiitt!!! I’ve done it! AT LAST!! AHHH!!” that’s basically why I kept playing for till this point (this review).\n\nGRAPHICS: As much as I don’t care about graphics, I do. In this game graphics plays a great job of showing you a great environment, not the best, but surly great.  I got to mention that, its always a good idea to take a look around you when in a new place. Additionally, there is Lara, she’s a beauty and she might be one of greatest reasons that anyone will play this game and I got to admit they did a great job fixing up her body!\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Should I think of playing this game? YES! Should I buy it? YES, its not that expensive and its great, it will surly keep you satisfied for a while.\n","December 7, 2015","true","14.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I do reccomend this game to anyone that wants to play the original Tomb Raider but doesn't like the graphics or controls.\n\nHowever i did uncover a slight glitch that was both funny but annoying. This glitch involed Lara Croft's ponytail, if you walk/run the ponytail will be left behind which will cause it to stretch until it realizes "i'm supposed to be here" then pings itself back to it's normal position; like i said that is both funny and extremely annoying. another bug involved the bats, if you shoot them they will die but before disapearing they'll go biserk and bounce around (like a bullet bounching of multiple walls). There is also a graphical problem where the screen will go a bit funny for a second or two then it will go back to normal.\n\ni also don't like the control tutorial part, i was using a controller but the game was giving me the keyboard/mouse controls instead of the controller options. Other than these problems i still think it's a great game and worth a play!","October 27, 2014","true","0.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I am thoroughly blown away by just how amazingly good Tomb Raider: Anniversary is. It is hands down one of the best action-adventure games I have ever played, and I enjoyed myself through the whole game. Having never played a Tomb Raider game before, this was a very pleasant surprise to me.\n\nNow I’ll actually tell you about the game. As you probably know, you’ll be playing as Lara Croft, a British archaeologist (and parkour master) who wields two pistols and swings on a grappling hook. The gameplay itself reminds me very heavily of the 3D Legend of Zelda games (Twilight Princess in particular) in that it’s all about solving puzzles, activating switches, fighting enemies, and discovering secret areas to finish levels and move on.\n\nSince this game is a remake of the original 1996 Tomb Raider, it shares the same story and environments with that game. However, although locations may look similar, the levels have been completely redesigned and are much different than the original, often involving much more puzzle-solving and combat with enemies than before.\n\nControlling Lara can be a bit cumbersome for you at first as the controls and camera take some time to get used to, but after you play for an hour or so it becomes very simple. The controls are greatly improved from the 1996 original, and it feels much more natural controlling Lara without the tank controls present in the original game. Now WASD actually moves Lara in the direction you press, and the mouse freely controls the camera.\n\nThe graphics are stunning for a 2007 game – the animated cut-scenes that play at some points during the adventure are very nicely rendered, the environments are extremely detailed, and the in-game models of Lara, enemies, and other characters all look great. There are, however, some minor problems with shadow casting, and Lara can on occasion appear to be floating due to wonky collision boxes on some objects, but these are largely ignorable.\n\nAll in all, Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a wonderful game, and a great title to start with if you’re looking to get into the Tomb Raider franchise. Anyone who has either played the 1996 original or is brand-new to the series should definitely give it a try.","February 29","true","19.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The graphics are pretty true to the visual style of the series while also bringing them up to date with the current generation of gaming. Gameplay, however, remains an archaic throwback to a much simpler time. There is very little plot to speak of in this installment (most characters are developed only in the unlockable extras you read after finishing the game) and dialog is few and far between. There are some excellent platforming elements here, but some can be absolutely frustrating due to the uncontrollable camera and loose movement controls. Despite the short length of the game, many platforming sequences and puzzles are repeated with only minor variations. There is very little combat in the game until the final chapter, but that's to be expected. If you've never played a Tomb Raider game before, this isn't a bad place to start. If you're a veteran, the nostalgia along with a few surprises here and there will satisfy.","August 12, 2011","true","18.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The "power dodge" maneuver adds a bit of interest, but combat mostly feels like a chore. The controls can be a bit clunky, however. The puzzles are great, however, and are the main reason I played the game.

The gameplay is fluid (particularly the shooting, which there is not much of), although the climbing and jumping is a little clunky. The game largely consists of trial-and-error platforming and puzzle-solving, fortunately providing generous checkpoints. The game looks quite beautiful for its age, to be honest. The storyline is pretty much non-existent. Gripped me for a while, but the lack of action and relentless platforming and puzzle-solving wore thin on me and I had little to no motivation to continue given the essentially absent storyline.","April 15","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/8000/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","Quick Summary: Tomb Raider Anniversary is a remake of the original Tomb Raider game, using the same game engine as Tomb Raider Legend. It’s nowhere near as graphically intense as the 2013 Tomb Raider reboot, and certainly less action oriented. If you played the 2013 reboot and remember the parts where you’re climbing walls and jumping from ledge to ledge, well Tomb Raider Anniversary is about 95% like that, and about 5% shooting wild animals.\n\nYou take on the role of Lara Croft, professional archaeologist, like Indiana Jones except working mostly for fun. Lara is sent on a mission to recover a mystical item that her father spent much of his life searching for, but she’s not the only one looking for the item and has competition in the form of other tomb raiders hired by the same evil corporation. The quest will take her all over the world facing not only booby trapped tombs but also indigenous wildlife and some armed opponents.\n\nLike most Tomb Raider games, Anniversary is played in third person perspective, which gives you more vision of your surroundings when platforming or wall climbing. You start with your trusty dual pistols with infinite ammo and as you progress you find a small number of other guns, but most of the danger in the game isn’t from enemies. It’s mostly spike traps and high falls when trying to get from one ledge to another. Note that your guns are actually surprisingly weak and it takes a lot of shooting to bring down any sort of wolf, bear, or lizard. An extra tool in your arsenal is the “adrenaline dodge” which lets you leap to the side at the last second when a large beast is charging you. If you do it right, there’s a quick time event that lets you do massive damage to the enemy. The adrenaline dodge is only available against animals with enough health that you can “anger” them with your pea shooters.\n\nPros:\n+Nostalgia + better graphics.  This is for people who have played the original Tomb Raider and want to revisit the experience without suffering from ancient game graphics/bugs.\n+A bunch of action puzzles where you’re climbing and jumping looking for ways to open doors and reach the treasures. I’m not too into this sort of thing, so a lot of it was lost on me.\n\nCons:\n-Too much puzzle solving for me… I’ve only played the Tomb Raider 2013 reboot and that was an action shooter with some puzzle solving side quests. Anniversary is puzzles with a tiny amount of fighting. A lot of the puzzles are not intuitive and I had to go online a bunch of times looking for what I was supposed to do next. It’s pretty easy to get turned around and not know where to go.\n\nOverall, if you enjoy puzzle games and aren’t too into action you can have some fun with Tomb Raider Anniversary. Just don’t go in thinking this is a shooter like the 2013 reboot. Even the isometric games like Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light had a lot more fighting.\n","March 9","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While the mechanics and animation are good, the gameplay is rather tedious, mainly in the shooting mechanics. The bullet time/rage was a good idea, but not executed well enough to my liking. The puzzle/climbing mechanics however, are good, fluid and perform well. It's a good game, but for being released in 2007, it really hasn't aged well, the textures are low res and the models are a bit . . . well, they're alright.\n\nI'll end this by admitting that I did enjoy the game, despite its flaws and tedious shooting mechanics and QTE's, but if you want to get into Tomb Raider, the newest reboot is a good place to start for fine story telling and gameplay. If you're feeling nostalgic, you can get the original on Steam, or get this one for the updated models.\n\n7/10\n\nRecommend for the story.\n\nF@CK QTE's.","December 18, 2013","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's true to the original format and idea of the game, has some very well made graphics and design that will not kill your computer, has puzzles that are in fact challenging and has nice hard to find secrets for the completionists. The story and cutscenes are made fun to watch and the game provides extra details like developer commentary and a little note to the fans. If your a fan from the first Tomb Raider then you will love this game and will enjoy some nostalgia. Likewise, if your new to the series this is the game I would recommend you start off with. The game will allow you to see the original idea and design in all its glory so if you enjoy it you can decided if this is a series you would like to play more.\n\nKeep in mind for new players, this is a puzzle game first and foremost, the combat and bosses can be enjoyable but this is not the main attraction of the game.","March 6, 2012","true","4.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is a huge upgrade from the original Tomb Raider, but it still suffers significant camera issues.  Often you will find yourself unable to figure out where to go without dying a few times just to find a platform to jump to which isn't right if the game doesn't have a quick save function.  The game suffers from clipping issues where you will find yourself jumping onto a ledge but you failed the jump and the character is stuck in a few pixels and she is in a state of constant falling but you can't jump or move because she is stuck and you have to wait for her to fall and die.  On top of that, the game suffers from terrible mechanics (or unresponsiveness to commands) where you are hanging off a cliff or ledge and there is only 1 direction to jump to and the character chooses to jump to another direction and ultimately failing the jump.  It is such a pet peeve for me that a game with such terrible mechanics dares to have time trials to make this game a challenge when the mechanics itself are the challenge.  A lot of the times the jumps are basically how lucky you are as a few pixels off and you're falling off a ledge.  The grapple-wall-running jump is the worst thing ever in this game.  The camera angle is constantly changing while you run along the wall and instead of a left right motion, you have to go from left to up and then down to right to gain maximum swing momemtum but when you jump at the end the direction you are pressing can impact the jump to forward or outwards, even though you have one direction you want the jump to (other direction will result death).  However, at the same time, these directions are inconsistent where sometimes you will jump outwards or forward with the same direction pressed.\n\nThis game needs a 3rd remake.  Honestly, people who rated this game positively has likely never finished the game (low game play time) or had tremendous luck getting those jumps.  This game has nice graphics and an interesting story for it's age but it did not age well with mechanics.  It is like old school 3d final fantasy games with broken camera angles.","March 17, 2015","false","36.4"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rasmusvh/recommended/8000/","rasmusvh","Rasmus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rasmusvh/","189 products in account","My experience has been that the real challenge of the game is the bugs. I think it'd been a lovely game, if it wasn't so buggy in every aspect, which is surprising considering just how few mechanics there are to use in the game.\n\nAI bugs involve just shooting at the first boss for 20 minutes, because he's just stuck doing his walking animation in the same spot unable to attack or move. The same goes for some of the 8-10 total different kinds of enemy creatures(this is not an exaggeration) in the game.\n\nThere's also annoying glitches, where trying to run over the edge of a ledge to hang from it ends with Lara just spassing out as she slowly falls further and further until she suddenly drops to her death.\n\nThe checkpoint system is also pretty poorly implemented in my opinion. A lot of the puzzles are so millimeter precise, for example in terms of jumping, that you often have to redo them all the way through, because you end up falling to your death. Once you respawn, you have to watch every single cinematic again that might be involved in the puzzles, which gets really tiresome. Besides of how strict the puzzles are, you sometimes end up doubting, if you're doing the right thing, until you finally get it right.\n\nI've also encountered bugs, where I had no choice but to reload an earlier save. For example at the beginning of the Egypt chapter, where no matter where and how I grappled the rocks you're supposed to pull down, they just wouldn't fall down.\n\nAs I said, if it wasn't for the incredibly, incredibly buggy, frustrating gameplay, I think it would've been an okay game. The story is extremely sparse. Considering there are only 4(?) chapters in the game, and you just skip straight from chapter 2 to 3 with no storytelling in between, it seems like the story didn't take the highest priority.\n\nThe best thing I can say about the game is that it has some beautifully looking levels, but that's about the only good thing I can say. I've never written a review for a game before, but this feels like a product that should still be thoroughly tested. There are such few mechanics and types of enemies in the game, and considering this is an anniversary edition, I'm really, really surprised that two of the biggest aspects in the game are so buggy that I encounter these abovementioned things at what I'd guesstimate to be half the puzzles, and a fifth of the enemies.","March 3","false","13.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

As such, I played Legend first and it was a good game. This game, however, has many more problems, some of which are literally game-breaking.\n\nFor starters, the story is not made as clear as in Legend. I knew why Lara was doing things and there were enough cutscenes to keep me filled in. In Anniversary though, the cutscenes are few, and they are far-between.\n\nThe main reason you should not get this game is the following: while the puzzles and parkour are much more difficult and challenging (not a bad thing), the game is WAY more picky about exactly when you hit the button, exactly where you are standing, small things like that that seem like not a big deal until you are browsing youtube for tutorials because you think you're just doing it wrong and find out you've been doing it right the whole time, its the game not letting you drag the block, or grab with your grappeling hook, or just simple things like that that wreck the game when they don't work, even after restarting the game, reloading the level, restarting the computer. Its like they released it without making sure small things like that still worked and when they don't, the game is literally broken and you can't continue even though you're doing what you are supposed to be doing.

Since the soon to be released reboot of the series is almost certainly going to wreck the franchise, I figured now was a good time to play through one of the seminal franchises of the Golden Age of Video Games.\n\nAt its core, Tomb Raider is a puzzle game.  The gameplay was a well thought out blend of old school and new school, making it feel nostalgic yet playable here in 2012.  It was really fun to enter into a room, navigate the environment and piece together the puzzle to advance the game.  It was classic Tomb Raider to be sure.\n\nVisually TRA was an unexpected surprise, taking the 2007 era game engine and adding in an advanced set of PC options.  Being able to take nintendo's original sex symbol and max out the graphics settings certainly makes playing through this title easy on the eyes.\n\nThe only complaint is the needlessly contrived boss battles.  Total immersion breakers for me.\n\nBut all in all, TRA is a winner.","October 13, 2012","true","21.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A huge improvement from Legends.\n\nCons:\n- Can't alt-tab. Isn't a big issue for most but since I streamed the game, it's a huge concern. Alt-tabbing will cause the game to black out and not reload.\n\n- Camera angles. Camera can sometimes zoom in too close to Laura basically obscuring the scenary around Laura. The camera can also be quite restrictive while doing jumping puzzles, basically meaning you can't see the ledge that you need to jump to. The movement can also fail to coordinate with the camera, causing you to move in an unintended direction. While this is largely limited to wall puzzles again, this game also has a lot of timed puzzles, so wasting time trying to re-coordinate your orientation generally ends with dissappointing results.\n\n- Fixed animations. A lot of actions result in going through a short animation of a couple of seconds. Some of these a useful as they are a visual cue for things; the turning animation for wall running is the point where you are supposed to reverse jump for example. However, most tend to cause unintended consequences with interactions with other elements of the game. Getting knocked down is an understandable consequence for some attacks, but enemies' attacks are not timed according to those animations, meaning you can get hit multiple times while trying to recover, or worst, get knocked back again and wait another cycle to recover. Another annoying animation is the animation of holstering weapons after activating buttons with countdowns which can cost 2 seconds of your time before you regain control of the camera and proper movement. At the later levels, uneven textures, like walls in the cave, completely mess up the turning animation.\n\n- Jumping movement is inconsistent and glitchy. Doing the same jumps at the same spot can yield inconsistent results. At times, if you just happen to be at the wrong spot, your jump can go off in a random direction, except the direction that you intended of course. Because a lot of paths are scripted, a lot of jumps can also fail simply because you are not in the right spot to trigger Laura to catch the ledge/object. On occasion, she may decided not to jump at all despite you pressing and holding the jump key.\nThe sliding slopes can also glitch out on you, starting the jump animation to make you think to jump only for Laura to stagger and just slide straight off.\n\n- Combat. Combat is like Legends (iirc), mainly lock-on but with manual aim for some instances. Now while the combat in Legends had issues, with basic enemies, it sufficed. Anniversary has a) significantly more flying enemies b) mainly melee enemies. The combat system in this game does not allow for much manual control on the move meaning you're completely at the mercy of the auto-targeting. The camera can't be moved manually as well and also has a very low ceiling. So basically the only way to properly switch targets is to untarget, wait for the holster animation to finish and hope to isolate the intended enemy in your view as you retarget. Also, it can auto-retarget at random.\nAnother part of the combat is the slow-motion sequences where you need to initiate a dodge to get a targeting sequence. At times, the dodge won't work and or the aiming sequence won't trigger. There are also times, the camera angle can also deface causing you to be unable to see the aiming sequence occuring. You can also get attacked by other enemies in this sequence, which can cancel the sequence or make it impossible to react to an attack.\n\nFor a game that requires precise timings in a lot of actions, it is both clunky as well as forces control away from the player in a lot of circumstances, this results in a poor gameplay experience overall. For a game where I enjoyed for about 60% of time, this quickly dissipated once more and more precision and reaction was expected of me, except that most of it was out of my control because of things like the camera not allowing me to see what I need to jump to or simply because I can't aim at what I need to shoot above my head. For all that I enjoyed in this game, it's basically meaningless when it comes to me actually needing to judge it on its gameplay quality, because a) this is a game, and b) the core mechanics that define this franchise and genre don't work properly.\n\nThere are also other issues like the 1st boss getting stuck in a corner and me spending a good 15 mins shooting at it while it remains there, and one particular segment where the only way to backtrack on a error in the puzzle is to maually reload to the last checkpoint (btw, this game doesn't have a return to last checkpoint feature, it's completely up to you saving the last checkpoint if you want to return to them. Otherwise, the only option is to die, which will automatically send you to it.) Bosses are quite grindy as well. I honestly felt that there was more technique required in Legends. One of the puzzles, near the end, is also nonsensically difficult, mainly because of a combinations of the issues mentioned above coupled with a very tight countdown timer. It took me about 4hrs to complete that part and was almost the breaking point as there was no other was to progress. Otherwise, as I stated at the start, they are quite fun to do.\n\nIn the end, I would only recommend this game to hard core fans of the genre and/or Tomb Raider and if you are willing to tolerate inconsistant movement and a lot of trial and error type puzzles. Otherwise, it can be a fustrating experience at core points that are needed to progress through the game.","April 8","false","19.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Controls are spot on, (mostly; sometimes glitchy in certain circumstances)  one of the main things I was looking forward to in the reboot, which failed miserably. Simple things, such as tapping the button repeatedly to move faster while climbing. The puzzles are genius. Gameplay stays interesting throughout the whole game up until the final boss- which was the only part I didn't like. I've played this game on every platform it's come out for and I have to say, despite the console, it really retains the quality one each console. The graphics are great and the PC version runs perfectly on even some of the most ancient computers. It really is a shame Square took over the series and seem to only focus on the graphics & "action" rather than the aerobics of which Tomb Raider was born in to.

IF you have a controller.\n\nI'm trying to play through this game with the keyboard controls, but it's so frustrating. One jump expects me to jump left, then activate the grappling hook. You need to hit the grappling hook immediately after jumping; there's just one problem. The default control setup requires you to use your ring finger (the weakest finger) for both left AND the grappling hook. Minor issues like these, coupled with the fact that combat is a complete mess (you use one hand on the mouse to shoot & move the camera, while your other hand has to handle moving Lara, jumping, AND rolling) makes using a controller necessary to enjoy this game to the fullest. I have this game on PS2 as well, and it controls like a dream with a dual analog controller. I personally don't have an Xbox 360 controller for my PC yet, so I have to make do with the keyboard for now. Blegh.\n\nOther than the awful controls, the game is great. The graphics and framerate are a big step up from the Wii and PS2 versions, although I personally would've liked to see the flashlight and the extra puzzles from the Wii version make an appearance. Got this game for like a dollar when the TR Collection was on sale, so it was well worth the money. If you like Tomb Raider, you'll love this carefully crafted remake of the original.

After a while the puzzles feel repetitive (but this is largely a question of personal taste). 95% of the game is pure puzzle platforming (so you should only play this if you really like that sort of gameplay). My playthrough broke down to frustrating trial and error at times. I found the keyboard/mouse controls difficult and at times inconsistent and unresponsive - Maybe it plays better on a console. I got stuck on some of the platforming and boss fights, so I had to look up the solutions online. I'm not a noob, but better hints and tutorials would have been helpful for me. It is also a pity there is no manual save system, and that the save checkpoints are not very forgiving - they were often far away from the part I struggled with, meaning I had to redo a lot after failing a sequence. Also, you have to manually “save” the checkpoint, otherwise, if you quit/reload, you lose all progress since the beginning of the game. Dare I say it, but this game may be too “hardcore” for me (even though I usually don't like it when games are dumbed down). While the experience was too frustrating for me, this is quite a good game within its specific genre.\n\nIf you like difficult platforming and old-school boss fights, you may like this game. Otherwise, there are simply too many flaws, so I sadly cannot recommend it.","October 3, 2015","false","12.7"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","6","14","3","1"

I don't know if it's better on console but I really don't recommand buying it on steam.\n\nStory / Setting\nTomb Raider: Anniversary is a remake of the first Tomb Raider game, the story is absolutely the same, but they did a good job at creating a game that is very influenced by the first one but not exactly the same with better graphics. I didn't finish the game but the story is really typical for a Tomb Raider game.\n\nGameplay\nFirst of all: the reason I don't recommand it. The ennemies and certain parts of levels are simply not playable, its just too buggy. Most ennemies get stuck and there's not any challenge, I got to a point at a boss fight were all I had to do was shoot at it and wait for it to die. Some of the game mechanics are also very buggy, I often see through the textures and I couldn't access some areas. There's also this: http://i.imgur.com/Zg331C4.jpg . Which is pretty funny but became a bit annoying :p\n\nExcept that, it's overall a good Tomb Raider game, pretty classic. It's really something between the very first Tomb Raiders and Tomb Raider Legend. As far as I played, the puzzles and secrets were too easy, especially compared to early Tomb Raider games and TR Legend, but hopefully they become more difficult later.\n\nPerformance\nRunned at very high fps on max settings (i5 4690 / R9 390)\n\nStyle / Graphics\nIt really looks like TR Legend, with obviously a TR1 inspiration for Lara and the levels.

There is one ring on the top of a wooden ramp (that looks like a door while closed) that cannot be targeted with the hook unless you switch to manual targeting ("R3" on Gamepad). There are two rooms where you have to lift four columns - I think one of the rooms cannot be finished when you go down too early without lifting the first column on your way down.\nI had general problems jumping backwards from a swinging rope or Lara missing the tip of columns as targets.\nNear the end there are some jump combos for which you have to know how to do fast combos while a countdown is running and you have to be ready to try it dozens of times even knowing the correct solution.\nWhen I wanted to continue after the "Lost Valley" my savegame started in "Lost Valley" again and I hadn't collected any of the three cogs. Luckily I had a manual save.\nTo survive later boss fights you need to know how to perform the "Adrenaline Dodge" action and it requires some timing skills. The last boss teases you that you will run out of ammo eventually. As you have unlimited ammo that isn't true, but you might run out of med-packs if you try to win by "adrenaline dodging" left or right.\n\nThe game is okay for the low price and if you are happy only looking into it for a few hours.","December 17, 2015","false","36.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","1"

Controls and especially camera control is very unpredictable so in many jumps Lara just jumps in WTF directions you would never expect. That with combination with the possibility to save the game only at predefined checkpoints, which are quite poorly chosen lots of times, makes a receipt for many repetitive tries where you have to go trough a long pasage of jumps just to try your luck at a difficult one. And when I write luck, I mean it, the game is full of bugs, where sometimes under some circumstances (such as particular resolution settings) you just can't make it. Some situations are also very unpredictable, because the length of the jumps varies at different places, so you can't be sure, if Lara will make it. On the other hand sometimes you ignore a place because you are "sure" that she can't make it that far, but if you watch a walktrough - yay, that was the solution!\n\nAll of the above could be forgiven if the plot and the puzzles were really good, but neither is IMO. The puzzles are really repetitive and because of the mechanics, controls and bugs really annoying. There are only two or three really original puzzles which I ejoyed. Boss fights are really boring as well, once you figure out, how to defeat someone, there is always a phase, where you have to repeat the moves dozen of times, before it is finished.\n\nIn conlusion as I wrote In the first sentence, this is a really frustrating game with almost no fun aspects.

I want so badly to like it, but there are things that just make this so difficult to enjoy. The controls are atrocious. For one thing, that wall-run mechanic makes so little sense. If you're used to modern Lara Croft or even just Mirror's Edge, be warned, the mechanics here are nothing like that. Combat mechanics are another reason why I so dislike this game. When I punch right, Lara goes left, right over a ledge and into a pit of fiery death. Then there's the awful adrenaline dodge mechanic, which is alright for users with controllers, but horrible for PC users. You have to be moving for that mechanic to work, and oh, don't shoot at the enemy until the targets line up! This mechanic works okay if you're in single-boss fights, but with multiple enemies, this is impossible.\n\nYou have an array of unlockables available, but this game really borders on the frustrating rather than challenging side of gaming. You may lose your mind. I certainly did at least a dozen times. My advice to you: play the originals if you can, otherwise, pick this up on console. I got it for like $2 on sale, so if you really want it, wait for that. Don't burn your cash on this. PC controls are awful.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kargor/recommended/8000/","Kargor","Kargor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kargor/","829 products in account","Nice game.\n\nMy playthrough info: I played on Easy, as always. Used an XBox-360 gamepad, and generally did not consult walkthroughs. I made the review after completing the game itself -- I haven't completed Croft Manor yet, and I'm still missing two secrets in the main game. I'm not a fast player, so it took me about 45 hours to get to that stage.\n\nI've started some old Tomb Raider games over the years, but never played them for long. This one... I finished it. And I'm planning to play the next one too. I didn't play the previous one due to Anniversary being advertised as a remake of the first Tomb Raider, but I might go back to that eventually too.\n\nOne might have to take a break every once in a while. You get to explore caves and ruins of ancient civilizations, filled with magic devices and traps and the occasional monster thingy to shoot. When you've finished that you get to the next area, where you get to explore caves and ruins of ancient civilizations, filled with magic devices and traps and the occasional monster thingy to shoot. After completing that... well, you get the idea, I hope :-)\nSo for me it did help to a take the occasional break. It didn't get "boring", though. Ok, maybe towards the end when almost every switch you flipped didn't just do the usual thing but also freed another monster thingy to shoot.\n\nBeing a puzzle-platformer with secrets and stuff, don't expect to just rush through the areas. It may appear impossible at times, but after a few retries you get an idea how things might work. Lara has the uncanny ability to just come back from the dead at a convenient location when she dies, so experimentation is key: can I jump there, or can I not? Well, lets try it...\nEven finding the secrets works out ok: everything in a level is there to be used in some way. So if you've reached the exit, and there's a ledge or pole or box or something else somewhere that you haven't even touched, chances are that there's another way leading somewhere you haven't been yet.\n\nThe game has plenty of checkpoints. In fact, on at least one occasion when I had to do a timed run to reach a secret (flip the switch to open the door, then reach it before it closes again) I had to make sure to avoid the checkpoint on the way, so I could just die and respawn at the checkpoint before the switch instead of having to reload that manual save or having to get to the switch again.\nIn most cases, though, hitting a checkpoint is more of a reward than a curse: you've completed a section of the area, and it's now safely behind you.\n\nJust know this: search the area for switches and stuff. Take your time looking at the rooms. Swim through every pool looking for stuff underwater. Jump on every rock that you can jump on. If that's not something you want to do throughout the entire game, don't play this. In most areas there's hardly any enemies to kill -- this isn't Borderlands. The game is about reaching the exit, and there's never a straight and easy path with signs.\n\nFor the bossfights, I did look up the dino since at the time I hadn't figured out the whole andrenaline dodge thing. Never used it on normal enemies anyway. I also looked up the centaurs since nothing I did seemed to work. For the other bosses, the game did a better job of "guiding" my actions, so all in all even the bosses worked out nicely. Even the final boss felt like it was supposed to be killed -- some games focus their bosses on merely frustrating the player.\n\nI did have the occasional problem with the gamepad controls, but that's probably just my skills. At one point I even checked a walkthrough to see whether I really have to take the route that I thought I have to take, and after confirming that I used a Flytool to get past that to the next checkpoint. But that only happened once towards the end. I'm still missing two artifacts, one of which I think I know, but having control issues again -- but these aren't essential, so I can just try it every once in a while.\n\nPS: since the shop page provides no trailers, here's two of them.","February 16, 2014","true","49.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ahiam94/recommended/8000/","Ahiam94","Ahiam94","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ahiam94/","289 products in account","Probably one of the most least enjoyable games I have ever suffered through. I bought this game along with every other Tomb Raider game ever made for $15 and I still feel like I was ripped off. Let me take the time to cover each subject and describe why I hate almost everything about this game.\n\nStory and characters - Let's start off somewhere easy. Tomb Raider has really never been a game where I really got invested in the story in the first place. Aside from the 2013 reboot, I never found myself able to really care for Lara Croft as a character and I couldn't even tell you any of the other characters names. The story for this game is very bland, it's not terrible, but it's just not that interesting at all. Unless you actually care about what Lara's dad did before he died. Like I said, the story isn't terrible, but what makes in unbearable to watch the cinematics are the characters.  Every one of Lara's enemies in this game are horribly written. Their scripts are awful, and they are all just absolutely terrible characters. You have man with an accent that calls Lara very cliche and annoying pet names like "kitten" and darlin'". Every time he said these words I would puke a little in my mouth. You have G-Thug punk foo gangsta who is just a little white kid thinking that he's cool cause his pants are down to his ankles and his hat is sideways. He stands out in the way that he just doesn't fit in to this game at all. He's also horribly written and has a script that made me want to rip out my eardrums. Then you have cliche big black tough guy. There's nothing to say about him other than he's cliche.. and badly written. And last we have main villain lady. From the moment I saw her to the instant I beat her at the end, I never once thought of her as anything but a god awful enemy that is also very badly written.\n\nTL;DR? Every character is an abomintation and their existence makes me cry.\n\nGameplay - The gameplay in this game is flawed. Beyond belief. There were times when I was playing that I could not believe that this was an officially released game. Lara often would just ignore obvious ledges and plummet to her doom. When trying to grapple onto a hook to wall run or just swing, she would commonly aim her grapple hook wrong and kill herself. Trying to move boxes around is something out of a nightmare. She'll constantly let go of the box and make you have to reposition her and try again. She would sometimes just not let go of boxes and cause me to just press the button that makes her let go about ten times before she finally listened. While pushing the box you will always run into invisible rocks on the ground that force Lara to let go of the box. One thing I have to mention is there was one level where I was on a ledge and I needed go to the end of the ledge jump to the left and grab onto another ledge. Easy, right? No. I died around ten times trying to do this. I eventually just assumed I was doing something wrong and I had to do get up another way, so I looked up a guide online. Turns out, I wasn't wrong. So, I kept trying to grab this ledge, but Lara would not grab it. She would just smack into a wall and fall to her doom. What I had to do, was go into the options and turn off auto grab. I HAD TO ADJUST THE CONTROLS OF THE GAME TO MAKE THE GAME WORK! That is not something you should have to do. Not in a game that is actually done with the development process, anyway. Oh man! I almost forgot to mention the fighting element of this game. It's trash. Pure trash. There is nothing good about it. You basically shoot the enemy until they flash, this flash means that their going to ram you. When they get close to you, you are supposed to dodge and that will trigger a little slow motion thing where you time a single gunshot that should kill the enemy. The problem is that sometimes the timing for your dodge lags and causes Lara to just do a normal dodge and get hit by the enemy. Sometimes when you DO dodge correctly and you shoot the enemy right on time, your bullet will just go right through him. It's terrible and it's not fun.\n\nTl;DR? The gamplay is awful and Lara is a broken character that rarely pulls off everything you need her to.\n\nThe graphics - I'm not talking about the actual graphics here. I don't care about that. The game is kinda old so I don't really know how good it looked when it was first released and I don't really care. What I do care about is the terrible textures that have tears in them and Lara's shadow that has random seisures and just disappears sometimes. Or there is always Lara's ponytail which will stay behind and just stretch out and eventually just snap back into place. Yeah, that's alwasy entertaining.\n\nTl;DR? The graphics are full of torn textures and annoying hair troubles.\n\nAnd lastly, level design - Terrible. Horrible. The levels are very often tedious, annoying, way more time consuming than they should be and just not fun. Most obstacles force you to climb through a series of ledges and traps which actually sounds like a lot of fun, right!? Well, it would be if Lara listened to the things I tell her to do... But she doesn't. Any area that has timed traps such as, fire, blades or walls that close in on you are pretty much horrible. I never found myself thinking, "Oh wow! What a fun challenge that was! I really hope there's more of that in this game!" No, never thought that. Instead it was more like, "Good god that was terrible. Who the hell thought that would be anything more than agonizing and frustrating?" That's pretty much what I thought throughout the entire game really.\n\nTl;DR? The map design could be fun, if the game were made right, but it's not, so it isn't.\n\nAll In all I would just say, don't get this game. And if you just got it with the Tomb Raider bundle just don't play it. Just play the original version. At least that game has a reason to be terrible. It's really old. It has an excuse. This game doesn't. It's just badly made. 3/10 - not completely broken. Just not well made.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\n2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Yes, the graphical improvement is amazing (even now it still looks stunning at times - game dates from 2007) but the game is very linear and makes it so you can only follow one straight path towards the end, which is sad knowing that the original game you really had to spend time searching how to solve puzzles and not to get lost in the maze.\n\nStill, some places really brought Tomb Raider 1 back amazingly well. St. Francis Folly is one of the examples that made me happy to see it in a different way then what they were capable of back in 1996.\n\nIn the end, it depends what you are looking for in this game.\nDiverse gameplay, searching around, solving puzzles? You'd better check out the original.\nFast-paced gameplay with ofcourse a big boost graphic wise?

In a gameplay consisting in half puzzle, half platformer, where mistakes are immediately punished, it makes the experience painfully frustrating.\n\nAll in all, the only thing this remake brings, is 2000's graphics.

All the things that make Tomb Raider what it is; the movement, the navigation, the environments, the enemies...they are all glitched to hell. And I don't mean 'a bit glitchy', I mean completely ruined. Sometimes game-stoppingly so. This has been released on several platforms, but I would bet money that this has had zero testing on this version.\n\nThere was one glitch where she wouldn't grab on to a ledge because she kept hitting something sticking out in the wall, and there was no other way round it. After some researching, I found out that lots of people have been having the same problem, and the only way for her to grab the ledge is to turn the aspect ratio down and full screen effects off. I'm not even ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you, then and only then did she clip through the rock on the wall and grab the ledge.\n\nPlus, it saves checkpoints as you progress through milestones in a level. Sometimes you fall down or something and may wish to start at the checkpoint instead of making your way all the way to it again. The only way to do this is to kill Lara somehow. If there isn't any water around, you have to dive onto the floor from high up. If she survives this, whatever you do, DO NOT LOAD SAVED GAME! It puts you right back at the ♥♥♥♥ing start of the level. There is no 'Load Checkpoint' option. You either kill her or you make your way back to the checkpoint. I've lost about 2 hours of gameplay and counting so far because of this.

There are plenty of huge issues with the game: at times cumbersome controls, clipping through objects when trying to grapple things that aren't the intended solution, terrible combat with awful AI, the checkpoint system in place that only lets you restart in said designated checkpoints when the game really needs quicksaves or something similar to the reboot. All of this could be chalked up to lack of polish (even if it is supposed to be a remake....), but that really isn't the case. This game is flawed at its core. It is so god damn boring.\n\nIf you don't like the first hour don't even bother going through the rest. It doesn't change one bit. Most of the mechanics are introduced up front, and the aforementioned issues will continue to knaw and knaw at you until you're throwing your hands up in frustration. There is absolutely nothing to break up the monotony. I liked what few cutscenes there were but they didn't hint at a real plot or anything. I managed to get through Peru with much struggling and the first part of the Greek tomb before getting tired of falling off and having to climb all the way back up again because the checkpoint was at the bottom of a huge pit.\n\nDon't buy this game.

I need that darkness that I can hardly see in, and more of Lara moaning. Just turning down the brightness wouldn't even hide the ugly that this game has going on right now. Think of Anniversary as in this prospect: It's that fat chick you ♥♥♥♥ed in the bar and try to sneak out of the house before daylight so your family/friends don't see your regretful/tasteless acts. Despite this series coming first, I also think that this game is the Alpha footage for the first Uncharted.\n\nI rather participate in an act of beastiality, than be forced to play another minute of this atrocious game.","December 5, 2013","false","2.5"," 5 of 32 people (16%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","16","5","32","0","1"

Easily the best itteration in the series of Tomb Raider games\n2. Lots of fan service paying homage to the original Tomb Raider\n3. Immersive locales and clever level design\n4. Awesome enviromental puzzles\n\nS Y N O P S I S:\nFor those who are unfamiliar with Tomb Raider, this game is an exploration adventure game. You control a female protagonist by the name of Lara Croft and are tasked with recovering various artifcats from different parts of the world while inevitably running into obstacles along the way. Ever since the very first Tomb Raider, the franchise has struggled to capture the same sense of awe and adventure that was embedded in the original. Tomb Raider Anniversary brings back the original creators with a new team of developers to create the ultimate Tomb Raider experience. This essentially is a remake of the first game with increased visual fidelity, a refined story, and enhanced game mechanics. It delivers on every aspect of the original archetype and more. This IS Tomb Raider, the way it's meant to be. It has larger than life places to explore which are varied in nature with challenging environmental puzzles. There is quite a bit of fan service here keeping in line with the formula that made the original great.\n\nPS. for Fans:\nI have to say that thusfar, there isn't a real modern Tomb Raider game other than this. Even the 2013 Tomb Raider title reboot fails on the key characteristics that make a Tomb Raider game. (You know something's wrong when raiding tombs is an optional feature in a game called Tomb Raider - I'm lookin' at you Square Enix) We'll have to see about the future titles they're creating. For now, we have  Tomb Raider Anniversary, and it's awesome.","August 16, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Animations for Lara and npcs and enemies look good, if a little stilted at times.  While skies in outdoor levels look not so good, the levels themselves look nice and detailed.  I also liked the water effects, even though the water seemed to always be tinted green.  My only issues are with the screen settings.  It seems that only certain Hz settings lag the game and in some areas, there is a HUGE amount of screen tearing, to the point that it dissoriented me.\n\nSound:\nThe music had some good tracks, but most were bland or repeated often, mainly the enemy encounter music.  The guns sounds lacked impact, therefor feeling like peashooters rather than high calibre weapons.  The voice acting was decent enough, but some voices seemed hammed, (like the gangsta boy the main villian sics on you).\n\nControl:\nDespite the fact that you can use a controller for this game, it will only show keyboard controls, leading you to take a few minutes of random button presses to fgure the controls out, though you figure it out after awhile.  Controls also seemed a little laggy at times, making it hard to make pixel-perfect timed jumps.  Lara also seems stiff and slow to respond.\n\nGameplay:\nI have to admit that while I really don't like platformers or platforming puzzles, I did enjoy playing this game.  The puzzles  are diffuclt, but still beatable for an idiot like me, with practise.  Checkpoints are sacttered well enough to reduce frustration when dying to a jump or puzzle, though that won't stop players like from still getting frustrated from dying 10 times to the same thing.  The levels are also filled with hidden areas with health items, ammo and guns to use.  Combat relies on locking on to enemies and dodging at the right time to get a single killshot on enemies.  The dodge tackes practise, but it will ultimately save a lot of ammo in the end.  Boss fights consist of filling it's rage meter and then some trick to hurt them (making them run into walls, shoot each other, etc).  The story, an expanded retelling of the first game, has a few slow parts, but very nicely picks up in the last half.\n\nIf you like/love the Tomb Raider series, this is a VERY good entry to the series and also a good starting point for anyone looking to get into the series.","January 1, 2015","true","29.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I mean Croft... looks sharp and tight (many times wet) and moves fluidly in the lush environments of Peru, Greece and Egypt despite annoying camera angles and somewhat tricky controls. Interesting level design (just original enough so that Spielberg and Lucas can't sue the developers for adaptating 'Raiders of the Lost Ark') and epic music and cinematics, with the occasionaly frustrating quick time event.  Gameplay is both satisfying and excruciating: you really gotta work to make it all come together. Even dodging an enemy can be a challenge as you have to hit all those buttons at the right time (and time the counterattack). Maybe Lara plays better with a big joystick instead of a regular mouse and I can't begin to imagine how hard the original game was to master before this revamped version (after almost 20 years, getting Lara to do what you want remains a chore repeatedly). The younger Lara in last year's prequel is so much easier to play with. You can really have her under your thumb. As a mature woman, she's hardcore. Like most very hot women, Lara Croft is very demanding, you've got to get the timing of your moves and jumps just right or she wont reach the heights to get her multiple rewards. She can be puzzling and you might take a while before finding that sweet spot that will unlock new parts of the level or hidden treasures or even overflow the level with fountains of water. The experience with her is daunting and draining at times and I like to take it one level at a time, coming back for seconds only on a good day. Her mysteries in the tombs Vilcabamba, Greek colysseums and mythological locations remain intact and fresh after all these years (ok, they we're lifted and redone, ILM style). Also included, Lara's home, a huge manor very fun to explore with lots of objects to play with.\n\nPS: The many collectibles (Relics and artifacts)  unlock artwork and other sexy outfists (so far the sportswear is my fav). Unfortunately, the often unresponsive controls might drive you mad before you want to retry any of the levels after completion (time trials? Yeah right), I barely got through when later in the game any jump stopped by the camera angle switching by itself would be an instant death. I can"t believe these problems weren't smoothed out before release, whatever happened to QA?

Unlike TR: Legend there is not a huge focus on the combat, it's mainly just platforming with the odd fights here and there. There are several unique zones to explore. The platforming and puzzles are good, and some of them are rather challenging at times. However, there were many times where bugs made the game irritating. Certain places where you couldn't see where you were jumping, not jumping in exactly the right way, and some other issues. They are easy enough to look over, except the ones that make the puzzles infuriating to solve, and the rest of the experience more than makes up for it. One final thing is that there isn't a lot of ambience in the zones. That may be fine with you but I didn't care for it.","December 2, 2013","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you only have vague memories of the original or are otherwise unfamiliar with Lara Croft's first adventure, Anniversary is a good game to play but maybe not play to completion. Even though it updated and rebooted Tomb Raider 1's brick like controls, there are still elements from its pre Assassin's Creed and Uncharted control scheme that are maddening. Those games made games with traversal mechanics look and control easily, but Tomb Raider is not as up to par.\n\nThe climbing and jumping controls are never as tight as you want them to be and work perhaps 85 to 90% of the time. There are repeated instances I encountered where Lara failed to grab ledges after walking off of them, and also ledges she didn't grab after a death defying leap that did in fact result in her death. The controls orient to the direction that the camera is facing, and in a game where you have control of the camera all the time, it can make it almost impossible to figure out the proper direction you need to press a button to make Lara go. Ever pressed up on your controller and seen a person climb DOWN a ladder? It happened to me. Twice. To say nothing of jumping off a swinging rope in the wrong direction repeatedly. Some sections seemed engineered to raise blood pressure.\n\nImperfect as it is, Anniversary does capture a feeling I felt missing in the latest gritty Tomb Raider reboot, namely that I was traversing ancient, labyrinth-like tombs with treasure to be had instead of an open world action game. Basically, there were no real 'tombs' in the new Tomb Raider, but this captured that feeling perfectly. The homages to the original game found here are a lot of fun, right down to the cutscenes. Some of the new boss fights can be a tad infuriating but are mostly a snap once you get Lara's new adrenaline dodging down pat. I still miss the original's T-Rex fight, but I can understand why they'd want to update it. Killing a giant dinosaur with only a pair of small handguns doesn't sound realistic, but what about this game should be? Also, making the in-game commentary markers look like the old save crystals was a nice touch.\n\nYou may not reach the end if you don't have the patience for the controls, which I know I don't, but even then I think this game is still a good Tomb Raider game even in its imperfect state. I just wish that Crystal Dynamics had gotten their controls right for this game instead of waiting a few years to nail the controls for Lara's Tomb Raider reboot. Worth catching on sale, but be prepared for lots of cursing during the more technical bits.","February 16, 2014","true","19.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My god. That is so weird.\n\nThis is an excellent adaptation of both the games, and the character. I feel like this Lara is closer to the Lara I wanted to see when the first game came out. She's kind of cold and distant, maybe a little aristocratic, almost. I've heard a lot of people complain about how she seems too "angry" and that she's not "flirty" with Larsen anymore. Those people are dumb. Lara is much more appealing and much more interesting when she's not whatever the scene needs to her to be; Lara is consistent in Anniversary, as a character, and as a person. Her character builds and changes throughout the game, rather than being a static mouthpiece for the original writers to act out childish, sexist fantasies. This may not be a character we always like--she's like an antihero in that way--but we can always empathize with her, because she's more human when she has flaws.\n\nThe gameplay is fantastic, the game is solidly built/programmed--I've never encountered a glitch in this game, and I must have played it on my PS2 through at least 3 or more times. The game is also beautiful, even if, much like in the first game, it suffers from inconsistent lighting and sometimes a wonky camera.","February 12, 2014","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The new one that came out last year, and remastered into the Definitive Edition. Square Enix did a great job. This Tomb Raider game is my favorite overall because the detail in each level was done really well. My favorite levels were Egypt and the final level of Atlantis. The costumes and the gold shotgun along with the silver Uzi's were my favorite parts altogether.

This spawned a trilogy consisting of: Legend, Anniversary, and Underworld as well as the spin-off (Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light) and the 2013 reboot that Square Enix published.\nAnniversary is the second game released after AoD and is arguably the best of the aforementioned trilogy. Legend had some graphical issues (such as a bug that causes the game to crash when "Next Generation Content" is enabled in the graphics options), some shoddy combat, and lacked a strong challenge. Underworld had a camera that hated you, and weaker platforming compared the the other two games.\nAnniversary (a re-imagining of the original Tomb Raider from 1996) improves upon Legend's foundation and fixes a lot of its issues. The levels are somewhat linear (especially compared to the open levels in Underworld, which actually worked against them in a way), but they offer solid platforming that challenges you because they're challenging, and not because Lara refuses to grab something (Legend) or because the camera is a sociopath (Underworld) or because it's ocassionally difficult to tell what can be grabbed onto (Underworld, again). If you die, it's because you ♥♥♥♥ed up, not because Lara suddenly had a minor brain aneurysm.\nIf you only play one Tomb Raider game, this one's your most solid choice (at least amongst the Crystal Dynamics games). Even at full price, it's a solid deal.","January 2, 2014","true","26.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Animations for Lara and npcs and enemies look good, if a little stilted at times.  While skies in outdoor levels look not so good, the levels themselves look nice and detailed.  I also liked the water effects, even though the water seemed to always be tinted green.  My only issues are with the screen settings.  It seems that only certain Hz settings lag the game and in some areas, there is a HUGE amount of screen tearing, to the point that it dissoriented me.\n\nSound:\nThe music had some good tracks, but most were bland or repeated often, mainly the enemy encounter music.  The guns sounds lacked impact, therefor feeling like peashooters rather than high calibre weapons.  The voice acting was decent enough, but some voices seemed hammed, (like the gangsta boy the main villian sics on you).\n\nControl:\nDespite the fact that you can use a controller for this game, it will only show keyboard controls, leading you to take a few minutes of random button presses to fgure the controls out, though you figure it out after awhile.  Controls also seemed a little laggy at times, making it hard to make pixel-perfect timed jumps.  Lara also seems stiff and slow to respond.\n\nGameplay:\nI have to admit that while I really don't like platformers or platforming puzzles, I did enjoy playing this game.  The puzzles  are diffuclt, but still beatable for an idiot like me, with practise.  Checkpoints are sacttered well enough to reduce frustration when dying to a jump or puzzle, though that won't stop players like from still getting frustrated from dying 10 times to the same thing.  The levels are also filled with hidden areas with health items, ammo and guns to use.  Combat relies on locking on to enemies and dodging at the right time to get a single killshot on enemies.  The dodge tackes practise, but it will ultimately save a lot of ammo in the end.

Crystal Dynamics, also notable for their Legacy of Kain series, decided that instead of a 1:1 graphical remake, they'd revamp the game from the bottom up for a modern perspective. This is the second time I've purchased and completed the game, the first time on the PS3.\n\nThe general graphical and gameplay improvements are palpable. The game looks fantastic, while emulating the often iconic setpieces and level design of Tomb Raider perfectly. Gameplay was transformed from its own miniature tank-controlled nightmare to better-than-average third person shooter, with the RAGE-dodge mechanic actually managing to be legitimately fun.\n\nAlso to note that the game is brilliantly optimized, and at notable times (several rooms in Greece and Egypt) runs better on my 1.8 Ghz laptop than it does on a PS3, with no notable slowdown.\n\nHowever, the "modern perspective" has brought with it some drawbacks. The ledge/rope hit detection is shoddy, with Lara having at times a 50/50 chance to recognise that she's collided with a ledge at all, as she proceeds to slide off it gently and gracefully to her death. This is compounded by the occasionally awful camera (which will actively decide not to show the platform you're aiming for), and when under a strict time limit or in an area that demands precise platforming, is infuriating.\n\nOn a less technical note, there are two bosses that return as pure QTEs. Not even difficult inputs, just cutscenes with prompts. Subjective as this opinion may be, QTE bossfights are a disgusting blight on the industry and it leaves a sour taste in my mouth whenever I replay those parts. That these bosses were originally fully-fledged fights instead of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cutscenes makes it all the more sour.\n\nAside from the respectively sized campaign, there is a sizeable amount of optional challenges. Relics - now individually modeled - and artifacts return, along with Time Trials. Time Trials now being challenging to the point that, even after beating them on the PS3, they require practice runs and multiple attempts; which makes them all the more satisfying to finally nab. There's overall not as many unlocks as, say, Tomb Raider: Legend, but the quality of the unlocks and the quantity of raw content more than make up for that.\n\nAnniversary supports gamepads - but it makes a fatal misstep that will probably lead to it being a major headache. Instead of taking advantage of the 360 degree input of analog sticks, it locks Lara's movement to eight directions. This means no minute changes to directional movement and involves a lot of frustrating jumping out into nothing. On top of that, it has a bad habit of not registering rapid-fire pistol shots - perhaps a productive of my low-spec computer, however.\n\nTomb Raider: Anniversary isn't a perfect game, but it is a fantastic game. If you're looking for a platformer with level design that stands the test of time and has some pleasing fluid gameplay to boot, then Tomb Raider: Anniversary should be right up your alley.","May 2, 2015","true","29.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I mean Croft... looks sharp and tight (many times wet) and moves fluidly in the lush environments of Peru, Greece and Egypt despite annoying camera angles and somewhat tricky controls. Interesting level design (just original enough so that Spielberg and Lucas can't sue the developers for adaptating 'Raiders of the Lost Ark') and epic music and cinematics, with the occasionaly frustrating quick time event.  Gameplay is both satisfying and excruciating: you really gotta work to make it all come together. Even dodging an enemy can be a challenge as you have to hit all those buttons at the right time (and time the counterattack). Maybe Lara plays better with a big joystick instead of a regular mouse and I can't begin to imagine how hard the original game was to master before this revamped version (after almost 20 years, getting Lara to do what you want remains a chore repeatedly). The younger Lara in last year's prequel is so much easier to play with. You can really have her under your thumb. As a mature woman, she's hardcore. Like most very hot women, Lara Croft is very demanding, you've got to get the timing of your moves and jumps just right or she wont reach the heights to get her multiple rewards. She can be puzzling and you might take a while before finding that sweet spot that will unlock new parts of the level or hidden treasures or even overflow the level with fountains of water. The experience with her is daunting and draining at times and I like to take it one level at a time, coming back for seconds only on a good day. Her mysteries in the tombs Vilcabamba, Greek colysseums and mythological locations remain intact and fresh after all these years (ok, they we're lifted and redone, ILM style). Also included, Lara's home, a huge manor very fun to explore with lots of objects to play with.\n\nPS: The many collectibles (Relics and artifacts)  unlock artwork and other sexy outfists (so far the sportswear is my fav). Unfortunately, the often unresponsive controls might drive you mad before you want to retry any of the levels after completion (time trials? Yeah right), I barely got through when later in the game any jump stopped by the camera angle switching by itself would be an instant death. I can"t believe these problems weren't smoothed out before release, whatever happened to QA? I can't believe play testers didn't complain about this!?","August 5, 2014","true","31.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although the game is essentially the same most of the levels have enhanced with extra puzzles and redesigned for Lara's newer abilities such as the grappling hook which was missing in the original version.\n\nThe visuals have been given a lick of paint and everything now looks much more natural. The square columns have gone and even Lara herself looks more like a real person rather than a couple of squares and a cardboard Halloween mask. It all looks great even for a game from the PS2 era.\n\nI do find that Lara's "grab" can be inconsistent. For example if you stand too close to a ledge and then jump back Lara will fall. Do the same thing again and she will grab the ledge. This can make navigating a pain especially in areas that have long drops. This does seem to be a minor problem and does make you play the game more carefully, which makes sense if you think about it.\n\nOverall this IS a great remake of a classic game and will give you a sense of nostalgia if you have ever seen the original.","May 21, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But Anniversary has me grinding my teeth and ready to break something! This is the first one I've played on a PC and perhaps that's part of my problem, because this game demands some pretty precise movement and timing which I find awkward on the keyboard. I have a controller which I've used with some success on other games, but it doesn't play well with Anniversary's camera "adjustments" so I'm forced to use the keyboard on any level that requires careful movement.\n\nWhich brings me to the timed run in the first part of "OBELISK OF KHAMOON". I'm not a big fan of timed gameplay unless it's specifically a "time trial" game option (don't like having to defeat "bosses" either, but that's a whole 'nuther rant!). I bought the game for the atmospherics, exploration and puzzles, NOT to spend literally HOURS repeating the same stupid set of leaps, climbs and swings just to reach the next checkpoint before the #*@&% pole slides back into the wall!!! The developers appear to have been very diligent in calculating the minimum possible timeframe to make this run, so all it takes is one errant keypress for Laura to FOOEY! fall back off a ledge she has just scaled or OH DRAT! fail to grab a handhold the first time or WHEEEEE! scale a ledge with her acrobatic handstand instead of just climbing up (because I held down the spacebar a smidge too long pardon me all to hell!) or OOPSIE! come to a screeching halt in the middle of a wall run because the auto-camera decides to swing the viewing angle around while she's mid-swing .......  *take a breath* ....... and it's a safe bet you're not going to get to that freakin' pole in time!\n\nI have eventually gotten through the previous "timed" portions of the game and I suppose I'll get through this one too if I don't stroke out or smash my keyboard over my head until I'm unconscious. But geez, I'm supposed to be having fun here and I'm definitely NOT!\n\nAll-in-all, I'd have to say it's a good game and well worth the ridiculously low sale price I paid for it, but be warned - unless you're a keyboarding/gamepadding zen-master or just really really enjoy watching Laura climb (you know who you are) be prepared for periods of intense frustration and boredom from time to time!

It's a well-polished, easy to learn game. Filled with amazing puzzles, beautiful locations, and just a feeling of adventure throughout the whole thing as you go to several locations throughout the world. Well thought out and very fun, especially if you are a fan of the earlier games. However there are a lot of camera problems and glitches that can cause you to die, or simply making you start the climb or puzzle again, which can be very frustrating and often times made me close the game and come back later. And combat I found boring quite often, it was simply hold right click to lock target, and mash left click while just using space/shift to jump and dodge around, but they had a variety of enemies which were nice. ( Dinosaurs!)But it was worth it to me as I enjoyed every other aspect of the game thoroughly.\n\nGraphics+ Beautiful graphics for its time\n+ Gorgeous environments (including outdoors and temples)\n+ Great variety in locations\n- Graphical glitches\n- Sometimes gamebreaking\n\nThe graphics in this game were quite beautiful for its time. Obviously compared to graphics on new games they are not up to par, but the beauty of this game outlives time. It is still amazing to look at as each environment is good looking, polished, and clearly had effort put into it. There is a nice variety so nothing looked just the same as the last area you went into and you really felt like you were in different parts of the world. There were, however, some graphical glitches that were sometimes gamebreaking or at the very least required you to restart from a previous save and lose progress. Frustrating at times, but not so many that it makes the game unplayable in any chapter.\n\nStory+ Interesting story\n+ Good dialogue\n+ Great info about Myths and Gods\n\nThe story of Anniversary was much like the older Tomb Raider games. Find a piece of an artifact, someone takes it, go get it back while finding other pieces of the artifact. The story was interesting, and the dialogue was well executed and kept me interested most of the time. In addition to the main story Lara would often talk about myths, legends, Gods, and just locations you visit in general. I personally like history and myths, so it was very entertaining for me to hear about certain temples and Gods (such as Anubis, Horus, Poseidon, and more) as I went further into tombs.\n\nOverall/Quick Review+ Great puzzles\n+ Beautiful locations\n+ Interesting story\n- Frustrating graphical issues and glitches\n\nBeautiful graphics, well executed puzzles, and amazing gameplay. Well-polished, challenging, and rewarding through it all. Combat is boring at times, although the enemies are varied and entertaining, and some graphical glitches and camera issues can make the game more frustrating and downright infuriating than fun at times.

I only bought this on sale because I purchased the latest Tomb Raider game and thought that game after playing an hour or so was cool, so I wanted to experience some of the games before playing that reboot (as silly as that may sound).\nAs this is my first Tomb Raider game, and understanding this is an HD remake of the original game with additional features I presume and not drastically making an entire new game, I still got what I expected. It’s a game about raiding tombs…So, even though this is a remake of an old game, it’s a game released in 2007, and I’m playing it in 2015 with my personal standards adjusted to somewhat compensate the difference.\nStory 5/10\nLara Croft gets approached to find some artifact. After long levels of jumping, climbing, exploring, solving puzzles, you get a short cutscene.\n\nSound 9/10\nFitting music, with mystical/mysterious tones as well as the typical fast-paced stuff when things get heavy for Lara.\n\nGraphics 9/10\nFor a game released in 2007 and a remake of an old game which had horrendous graphics (I lived through that age of heavy pixels) I was satisfied with what was presented in this game. The surrounding environment, in the temples and such were not unpleasant to look at.\n\nGameplay 7.5/10\nAs I mentioned that I never played any previous Tomb Raider games, I still knew what to expect since it was based on the older games.\nIt’s 90% running around, pushing boxes, jumping, rolling, climbing, and/or solving puzzles. 10% using guns.\nSide note: I wonder why Lara has infinite ammo for her starting pistols? And this is eventually relevant to the story in the final boss fight which made me chuckle, you’ll find out if you get there.\n\n-Jumping and rolling is cool, as Lara is acrobatic so she can do flips or a handspring. Also, for jumping onto far ledges you might lose your grip and have to press E to fix it, so that’s a cool addition to the genre of platforming games. When the opportunity is present, you can use your grappling hook to run across walls or swing across a room, though the controls combined with the camera angle made it annoying sometimes to jump to where you wanted to go.\n\n-Additionally with camera angles, they were sometimes annoying during climbing. E.g. you’re on a ledge, and you may need to jump to behind you (180 degrees). But sometimes I didn’t know that beforehand, so while you’re hanging on a ledge, the camera can’t move to see behind you for some reason.\n\n-As for guns, you get a few additional weapons that you discover. What’s cool is the rare enemies you do actually face, is the dodging move, where time slows down a bit and if you time it right you can deliver a critical hit after rolling out of the way.\n\n-Targeting multiple enemies is a bit of a pain. The rare time there are multiple enemies that can give you trouble, perhaps I just missed what proper way to do so, but I was using my mouse to switch targets but it is not a smooth transition at all, almost unresponsive at times.\n\n-Some puzzles and proper routes felt challenging, at least for me. I ended up looking at video walkthroughs many, many times to avoid wasting time. I’m a crappy tomb raider.\n\n-Sometimes controls feel shtty, this is probably the top two gripes I have with the game (the first being a lack of action/gun play). Jumping and reaching where you want to go is not as easy and smooth as I would like (It doesn’t happen every time, but it’s something that definitely negatively affects the experience). I probably swore more times from missing jumps than any other game I’ve every played.\nThere was even one point, climbing up the same ladder, I pressed the same controls to jump (as I did successfully did before) but it wouldn’t let me reach the ledge. I ended up jumping onto a wall and then falling, taking some damage. This is definitely more annoying than the Assassin’s Creed games.\n\nAll in all, I have mixed emotions on finally completing this game. I’m happy to finally complete a tomb raider experience cuz it has spawned so many games. On the other hand, this game is not one I will probably ever play again. I have no desire to touch Croft Manor, whatever extra gameplay it offers aside from story mode.\n\nOverall score for me is 7.5/10\n\n\nIf I was a gazillionaire, I'd offer a million dollars to anyone who hasn't played the game before to beat this game (with the assist of a video walkthrough) with only ten lives. That's how frustruated I was at times with the controls resulting in many, many falls to my death.","November 6, 2015","true","26.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although the game is essentially the same most of the levels have enhanced with extra puzzles and redesigned for Lara's newer abilities such as the grappling hook which was missing in the original version.\n\nThe visuals have been given a lick of paint and everything now looks much more natural. The square columns have gone and even Lara herself looks more like a real person rather than a couple of squares and a cardboard Halloween mask. It all looks great even for a game from the PS2 era.\n\nI do find that Lara's "grab" can be inconsistent. For example if you stand too close to a ledge and then jump back Lara will fall. Do the same thing again and she will grab the ledge. This can make navigating a pain especially in areas that have long drops. This does seem to be a minor problem and does make you play the game more carefully, which makes sense if you think about it.\n\nOverall this IS a great remake of a classic game and will give you a sense of nostalgia if you have ever seen the original.","May 21, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But Anniversary has me grinding my teeth and ready to break something! This is the first one I've played on a PC and perhaps that's part of my problem, because this game demands some pretty precise movement and timing which I find awkward on the keyboard. I have a controller which I've used with some success on other games, but it doesn't play well with Anniversary's camera "adjustments" so I'm forced to use the keyboard on any level that requires careful movement.\n\nWhich brings me to the timed run in the first part of "OBELISK OF KHAMOON". I'm not a big fan of timed gameplay unless it's specifically a "time trial" game option (don't like having to defeat "bosses" either, but that's a whole 'nuther rant!). I bought the game for the atmospherics, exploration and puzzles, NOT to spend literally HOURS repeating the same stupid set of leaps, climbs and swings just to reach the next checkpoint before the #*@&% pole slides back into the wall!!! The developers appear to have been very diligent in calculating the minimum possible timeframe to make this run, so all it takes is one errant keypress for Laura to FOOEY! fall back off a ledge she has just scaled or OH DRAT! fail to grab a handhold the first time or WHEEEEE! scale a ledge with her acrobatic handstand instead of just climbing up (because I held down the spacebar a smidge too long pardon me all to hell!) or OOPSIE! come to a screeching halt in the middle of a wall run because the auto-camera decides to swing the viewing angle around while she's mid-swing .......  *take a breath* ....... and it's a safe bet you're not going to get to that freakin' pole in time!\n\nI have eventually gotten through the previous "timed" portions of the game and I suppose I'll get through this one too if I don't stroke out or smash my keyboard over my head until I'm unconscious. But geez, I'm supposed to be having fun here and I'm definitely NOT!\n\nAll-in-all, I'd have to say it's a good game and well worth the ridiculously low sale price I paid for it, but be warned - unless you're a keyboarding/gamepadding zen-master or just really really enjoy watching Laura climb (you know who you are) be prepared for periods of intense frustration and boredom from time to time!

Now I will clarify now that I haven't played the original Tomb Raider game, mostly because I was barely even around when the game was released. So because of this, I will be reviewing the game as the single game that it is, and not as a remake as another game.\nTomb Raider: Anniversary definitely took me back to my younger years of gaming. Reminding me of the challenging titles I would spend countless hours playing; such as Spyro, Harry Potter and Crash Bandicoot. This game shows that there is more to gaming than just aiming and shooting at endless AI.\nTR: Anniversary takes you on a journey to four distinct locations: Peru, Greece, Egypt and the Lost Island, as you scale massive structures and defeat a variety of different enemies to recover the three pieces of Scion. This journey is divided into a series of chapters, each location having three or four each. Most chapters will take the average player around 10 - 15 minutes to complete depending on its size. On my first playthrough, it took me 09 hours 31 mins to complete the entire game, not including deaths, pauses and retries. That was on hard difficulty whilst also collecting all the collectibles as well.\nThe majority of the game you will find yourself scaling massive structures and navigating deadly paths. Although for the most part you will not encounter any problems, it is no secret that the game's sense of direction is a bit vague. Sometimes you can be looking directly at a ledge, but when you jump, Lara seems to decide that a more diagonal jump is required, meaning that she misses the ledge all together and inevitable falls to a squishy fate. However, due to the game's frequent checkpoint system, these frustrating moments tend to have minimal impact on the game as you are never more than a minute behind where you were before. The only time this does become an issue is when you are trying to complete the various time trials for each level. I can recall a number of times I had to restart an entire chapter due to this. I found that most errors can be compensated if you just take a little care when lining up your jumps.\nWhilst for the most part the game is pretty straight forward in where you need to go, I did find myself getting lost in larger more open areas. However, for the most part the game is quite linear and easy to follow. It's only when you need to backtrack or when something is hidden that you may need to stop and think for a bit. Overall, I found the game to not be to difficult, so you are not stuck trying to complete a single bit for hours, and not too simple that it doesn't require any thought at all. I think this was a near perfect balance for both enjoyment and satisfaction.\nWhilst navigating the world, Lara has various means of moving around. These are all explained in the early chapters of the game, and include wall running and swinging amongst some more obvious. After a while, these means of movement kind of feel old and overused as they are so few in number. You find yourself constantly swinging and wall running everywhere you go. I was disappointed to not see any vehicle sequences throughout the game, as I think this would have made an improvement to the game, and help to break up these large climbing areas - although I guess this was most common for a game of this age.\nThe combat in the game is broken into three categories; main combat, boss combat and quick time events. The majority of this combat will be done using the lock-on firing mode. My personal experience with this was much like the navigation in the world, it seemed to want to lock on to everything but the enemy. This made combat a little more frustrating as when there is a massive bear charging towards you and you keep shooting a switch the entire time it does kind of break the atmosphere. The game does also offer a manual firing mode, although I would strongly advise against this as the movement is very sluggish and Lara becomes rooted to the spot when in this mode - making you an easy target.\nMain combat makes up the majority in the game and is usually done with two or three low health enemies that run towards you. These range from from flying enemies to larger ground based enemies to rats! These enemies all work in mostly the same way: you fire a bunch of shots at it until it gets mad and charges at you, whereby then you, if timed correctly, enter a slow motion sequence where an insta-kill can be performed. Failing this, you could always just spam them with bullets till they drop.\nThe game doesn't offer many boss battles, but the ones that they do are largely varied based on who they are. You will usually take a couple minutes to figure out how this enemy works, and what their weaknesses are before you can start taking them down. I enjoyed the variety with these enemies as it wasn't just a shoot and dodge scenario. When I played the game, I was on hard difficulty and I was able to defeat most enemies pretty easily once I knew how they worked.\nThe last type of combat you will encounter is quick time events. These are, for the most part, rather fun and bad ♥♥♥. How these work is a cut scene will play for a bit, then it will begin a slow motion sequence where you then have to press the correct button that pops up on screen. These usually correspond to the in game controls, so for example, jump is A and so on. I enjoyed playing these as it helped give variety to the game's combat, but they were rather basic. Each event would consist of around three or so single buttons to press every few seconds. It would had been nice to maybe see some longer events like this, that have more complex buttons, but overall they were fun to play, even with how brief they were.\nNow it doesn't seem right to talk about achievements in a review, but since this is an achievement site it kind of does feel right. Having just completed this myself, I can tell you that this is a pretty easy game to complete, but you are going to need to put the work in. It should take around 10 - 12 hours to max whilst using a guide, and will require a minimum of two playthroughs, one on hard difficulty and collecting the collectables, and two, getting your running shorts on for some speed runs. Yes, there are collectables in the game but don't worry because there are only a handful on each level, with most appearing near enough along the main path anyway. Just use a guide, and there are plenty of them, and you should have no problems at all. Hard difficulty is not much of a challenge in my opinion. I haven't played the game on any other difficulty to provide some comparison, but I was able to complete this with little to no trouble at all. The majority of your gamerscore will come from completing sections of the game without dying - which sounds kind of tough. Well it is actually very easy if you frequently save, as whenever you die, just reload the save and bam, you never died.\nSo now it's time to draw this review to a close. I'm giving this title a four out of five, the only reason it didn't score a five is the technical problems it has that just holds it back a tiny bit, and causes you to scream at the TV a few more times than you should. Even with these bugs, I very much enjoyed playing the game, and have already downloaded Legend and Underworld ready to play hopefully very soon.\n*NOTE * This review was taken from my TrueAchievements profile (http://www.trueachievements.com/Tomb-Raider-Anniversary/reviews.htm#c891989) and was published 24 June 2015 at 22:52.","November 16, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Tomb Raider may have been the first game to take advantage of the 3dfx video card (first a daughter-board, and then it's own do-it-all video card).  The 3dfx chipset has gone the way of the Do-Do, but Tomb Raider lives on.  The original graphics were stunning, and while the look and feel has changed over the years, it's still an aesthetically pleasing game, with fear-of-height-inducing levels and brain-teasing puzzles.

Though if you want a game that is pretty much challenging as in a certain strategy to beat a boss; This remake does that job particularly well.\n\nSome of the Music is damned great and a badass intensity for some bosses. Some pieces are remade that the first Tomb Raider player would definitely recognize.\nSpecifically the Centaurs Boss theme. Yes. That song rocks like hell.\n\nThe level design feels far more shorter in comparison to the original.. In a way some levels feel like they practically merged together [I played the original so I can tell the differences between the two] though the puzzles can be really difficult to some others though I beaten this game before so I can't say it feels a first time deal.\n\nThe bugs? Well mostly doesn't appear much but you do have small times where it just glitches on you or you cannot grab no matter how close you are. I would never recommend playing this game on PC. The Console versions are more fixed than this despite the graphics are great for the most part on the PC but the gameplay could use a little fix then it's all set for good.\n\nEither way; Yes I do recommend this game but be prepared for some bugs in the game..

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BarkerGuruGamer/recommended/8000/","BarkerGuruGamer","Barker Guru","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BarkerGuruGamer/","198 products in account","**GAMEPLAY SERIES** (Spoilers)\nhttps://youtu.be/oTCsbV5af1A\nHaving just completed this title eight years after it's release, I feel that a review is in order. Now I will clarify now that I haven't played the original Tomb Raider game, mostly because I was barely even around when the game was released. So because of this, I will be reviewing the game as the single game that it is, and not as a remake as another game.\nTomb Raider: Anniversary definitely took me back to my younger years of gaming. Reminding me of the challenging titles I would spend countless hours playing; such as Spyro, Harry Potter and Crash Bandicoot. This game shows that there is more to gaming than just aiming and shooting at endless AI.\nTR: Anniversary takes you on a journey to four distinct locations: Peru, Greece, Egypt and the Lost Island, as you scale massive structures and defeat a variety of different enemies to recover the three pieces of Scion. This journey is divided into a series of chapters, each location having three or four each. Most chapters will take the average player around 10 - 15 minutes to complete depending on its size. On my first playthrough, it took me 09 hours 31 mins to complete the entire game, not including deaths, pauses and retries. That was on hard difficulty whilst also collecting all the collectibles as well.\nThe majority of the game you will find yourself scaling massive structures and navigating deadly paths. Although for the most part you will not encounter any problems, it is no secret that the game's sense of direction is a bit vague. Sometimes you can be looking directly at a ledge, but when you jump, Lara seems to decide that a more diagonal jump is required, meaning that she misses the ledge all together and inevitable falls to a squishy fate. However, due to the game's frequent checkpoint system, these frustrating moments tend to have minimal impact on the game as you are never more than a minute behind where you were before. The only time this does become an issue is when you are trying to complete the various time trials for each level. I can recall a number of times I had to restart an entire chapter due to this. I found that most errors can be compensated if you just take a little care when lining up your jumps.\nWhilst for the most part the game is pretty straight forward in where you need to go, I did find myself getting lost in larger more open areas. However, for the most part the game is quite linear and easy to follow. It's only when you need to backtrack or when something is hidden that you may need to stop and think for a bit. Overall, I found the game to not be to difficult, so you are not stuck trying to complete a single bit for hours, and not too simple that it doesn't require any thought at all. I think this was a near perfect balance for both enjoyment and satisfaction.\nWhilst navigating the world, Lara has various means of moving around. These are all explained in the early chapters of the game, and include wall running and swinging amongst some more obvious. After a while, these means of movement kind of feel old and overused as they are so few in number. You find yourself constantly swinging and wall running everywhere you go. I was disappointed to not see any vehicle sequences throughout the game, as I think this would have made an improvement to the game, and help to break up these large climbing areas - although I guess this was most common for a game of this age.\nThe combat in the game is broken into three categories; main combat, boss combat and quick time events. The majority of this combat will be done using the lock-on firing mode. My personal experience with this was much like the navigation in the world, it seemed to want to lock on to everything but the enemy. This made combat a little more frustrating as when there is a massive bear charging towards you and you keep shooting a switch the entire time it does kind of break the atmosphere. The game does also offer a manual firing mode, although I would strongly advise against this as the movement is very sluggish and Lara becomes rooted to the spot when in this mode - making you an easy target.\nMain combat makes up the majority in the game and is usually done with two or three low health enemies that run towards you. These range from from flying enemies to larger ground based enemies to rats! These enemies all work in mostly the same way: you fire a bunch of shots at it until it gets mad and charges at you, whereby then you, if timed correctly, enter a slow motion sequence where an insta-kill can be performed. Failing this, you could always just spam them with bullets till they drop.\nThe game doesn't offer many boss battles, but the ones that they do are largely varied based on who they are. You will usually take a couple minutes to figure out how this enemy works, and what their weaknesses are before you can start taking them down. I enjoyed the variety with these enemies as it wasn't just a shoot and dodge scenario. When I played the game, I was on hard difficulty and I was able to defeat most enemies pretty easily once I knew how they worked.\nThe last type of combat you will encounter is quick time events. These are, for the most part, rather fun and bad ♥♥♥. How these work is a cut scene will play for a bit, then it will begin a slow motion sequence where you then have to press the correct button that pops up on screen. These usually correspond to the in game controls, so for example, jump is A and so on. I enjoyed playing these as it helped give variety to the game's combat, but they were rather basic. Each event would consist of around three or so single buttons to press every few seconds. It would had been nice to maybe see some longer events like this, that have more complex buttons, but overall they were fun to play, even with how brief they were.\nNow it doesn't seem right to talk about achievements in a review, but since this is an achievement site it kind of does feel right. Having just completed this myself, I can tell you that this is a pretty easy game to complete, but you are going to need to put the work in. It should take around 10 - 12 hours to max whilst using a guide, and will require a minimum of two playthroughs, one on hard difficulty and collecting the collectables, and two, getting your running shorts on for some speed runs. Yes, there are collectables in the game but don't worry because there are only a handful on each level, with most appearing near enough along the main path anyway. Just use a guide, and there are plenty of them, and you should have no problems at all. Hard difficulty is not much of a challenge in my opinion. I haven't played the game on any other difficulty to provide some comparison, but I was able to complete this with little to no trouble at all. The majority of your gamerscore will come from completing sections of the game without dying - which sounds kind of tough. Well it is actually very easy if you frequently save, as whenever you die, just reload the save and bam, you never died.\nSo now it's time to draw this review to a close. I'm giving this title a four out of five, the only reason it didn't score a five is the technical problems it has that just holds it back a tiny bit, and causes you to scream at the TV a few more times than you should. Even with these bugs, I very much enjoyed playing the game, and have already downloaded Legend and Underworld ready to play hopefully very soon.\n*NOTE * This review was taken from my TrueAchievements profile (http://www.trueachievements.com/Tomb-Raider-Anniversary/reviews.htm#c891989) and was published 24 June 2015 at 22:52.","November 16, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like it. I like how they incorporated Atlantis into the game's story. I'm a real sucker for stories about "lost cities" like Atlantis, so as expected, I really enjoyed the story of the game. Atlhough, I was a little bit disappointed since there aren't really that much cutscenes in the game. I feel like most of the game is spent solving puzzles and fighting enemies. This makes me feel a little bit unsatisfied because it felt like the game's story was short. However, it's a good story nonetheless.\n\nDifficulty:\nThere are two things I wanna talk about in this part. Puzzle and enemies.\n\nPuzzles:\nThe puzzle part of the game is really well done. In terms of difficulty, I don't think puzzles in this game are very hard. They just require you to think. This is one of the things that I really like in this game. Some of the puzzles in this game were too complex that I actually struggled on some of them, and I actually like it. I like that feeling you get when you actually solve a really hard puzzle. It feels rewarding. The best part about puzzles in this game is that you don't even get a single hint on what to do when you're hit with one.\n\nEnemies:\nEnemies in this game aren't really that hard to beat. Although, I really find them annoying sometimes. When you get knocked down by one of their attacks, they probably will hit you by the same attack again as you're getting up which will knock you back down. This is really annoying especially when you're fighting flying enemies on a ledge high above the ground or above a pool of lava. You could actually fall down because they're just continuously doing their blast attack on you which pushes you off the ledge.\nControls:\nFor the most part controls are okay. I do find some things annoying.\n\nFirst of all, targeting is sometimes annoying. When you're fighting moving enemies, especially flying enemies, the camera will lose focus and make you aim at thin air or something you don't even want to aim at.\n\nSecond, camera in this game isn't that good. Sometimes when you're doing puzzles that require jumping (walls, ledges, pole, etc.), the camera will completely fail you and will cause you to jump at the wrong direction, and if you're jumping from a really high place, this will cause you to die. I died so many times at puzzles and places that I wasn't even supposed to die at because of this.\n\nGraphics:\nThis game came out in 2007 so it's understandable that it can't compare to the graphics of games nowadays. I can say, however, that this game's graphics is really good considering the time of its release. I mean, even now, compared to the games nowadays, this game's graphics isn't that bad.\n\nTL;DR (Overall):\nI think this game is really well-done. The story is really amazing. However, this game has a lot of puzzles that you must solve. A good number of them are, in my opinion, so complex, that you may want to look up a walkthrough online. Controls are good for the most part, but can be annoying at times. Graphics aren't that bad compared to the games nowadays. I do recommend people to play this game because it's really fun and enjoying to play.\n\nI rate this game 8/10","December 1, 2015","true","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is not a lot of story, but the atmosphere makes up for it. There are cutscenes, but they aren't very long (and are skippable), just to get the player moving from point A to point B.\n\nJumping feels a bit weird when compared to the original Tomb Raider game. Here it's more magnetic and makes it more obvious where you can jump to, what you can climb and so on. Puzzles consists mostly from pushing blocks, pulling switches and using grappling hook.\n\nMy only beef with this game were the QTEs that didn't exist in the original and those QTEs actually removed some of the gameplay that was present in the original (as few boss fights were turned into QTEs).\n\nNormal enemies can take a lot of hits to kill and most of the time you have to kill them by using Adrenaline Dodge (a mini-QTE with bullet time mechanic which insta-kills a normal enemy) instead of just shooting and dodging manually until they die.\n\nCheckpoints are OK, but they removed some challenge from the original. Didn't like how reloading from last checkpoint restored to full health making medipacks less valuable.\n\nFinding all hidden relics/artifacts and completing very difficult, yet rewarding Time Trials to unlock more features adds some replay value.\n\nThis is a great game for newcomers as for fans of the original game.\n\nOnly thing that can't be done in this game is shoving Winston (Lara's butler) into the fridge.","March 5, 2015","true","33.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It still has an atmosphere of something different; traversing the terrain is a puzzle but an immensely satisfying one and modern game design has taken off some of the really rough edges.\n\nLara too feels different to the weird creature used as a marketing tool: She is predominantly silent in this outing and very acrobatic, but instead of feeling like she exists to be objectified there is a sense of purpose in how she climbs and leaps from place to place. It's hard to fully explain but when she pulls herself up a high ledge it feels like I am controlling a determined gymnast and in some sense I feel I am there, showing that strength and dexterity.

It was pretty impressive, but it was super hard to control. I hated the controls so much. I tried it with a joystick and that wasn't really any better. I spent most of my time being killed by various animals and accidentally falling off of stuff. And watching Lara Croft's low-polygon butt move as she walked, and noting that she was very pointy and sharp in many places.\n\nThis 2007 remake of the game is so much better. It still has a few minor issues with the camera running into walls and difficulty seeing where you are jumping when you're hanging off a cliff face and jumping behind you, but I guess that's just part of the game... But the controls are standardized, the graphics are much better, the game is much more enjoyable. Steam is asking "Do you recommend this game?" Yeah, yeah I do. It's a pretty good game.

I finished this game in about 19 hours total playtime over the course of a couple weeks.  If you have enjoyed previous games in the series this one is quite similar but with newer graphics and physics capabilities.\n\nBe warned though, save your game often as there are a number of bugs.  I played through a particularly difficult part of the game only to end up finding that I got stuck later on and had to reload a save that was before the difficult part.  Needless to say this was annoying.  I suggest a save after most checkpoints, or at least major events, especially in the end during the "tower ascent" portion, there I would say save at every checkpoint and don't overwrite any saves, you never know how far you may have to go back.","December 24, 2010","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mugros/recommended/8000/","Mugros","Mugros","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mugros/","879 products in account","Overall an OK game.\n\nIt starts as a good game but declines towards the end. There are times where everythings works fluently and then all of a sudden you have some parts where one easy misjudged jump makes you repeat a section over and over. At a couple of spots it is hard to tell if you have the right idea or not. And when you do the move and fail you might have to redo lots of previous moves to get to the same point, because there are no real saves, only checkpoints. These are mostly well placed, but sometimes I'd wish I could save anywhere. This way trial and error would be for fun and less aggravating.\nThe camera ranges from good to bad. Sometimes jumping is more like taking a leap of faith than proper planning. It's really bad when the camera decides where you should look.\n\nMovement is generally ok, but there are some very difficult to pull off moves like the one jumping off a wall after swinging on a rope. It only worked by pure chance for me. This is also why the games becomes tedious at the end. More and more puzzles demand advanced moves and then it's less fun if they constantly fail.\nMoves were also sometimes buggy. So it happens that Lara moves hanging on a pole towards the wall even though I'm pressing and looking in the direction she should swing. Or... sometimes she simply doesn't hold onto a ledge after jumping down. It's not overall bad, but feels unpolished sometimes.\n\nI didn't like the gun play at all. Sure, it is easy enough with lock-on and unlimited ammo, but often you get in close combat with an enemy and then it's just frantic shooting until he dies, because it's impossible to follow the enemy with that camera.\n\nWhat's missing is a good journal that tells you at least a little bit what to do at the moment. The included journal is a joke and gives either no hints or cryptic ones that didn't help at all.\n\nBut overall it's still worth playing if you are a fan of Tomb Raider. I did play the original an honestly, didn't notice any huge resemblences. Mabe I played the original too long ago :D","September 26, 2015","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/1PlayerSlayer/recommended/8000/","1PlayerSlayer","StrangeAxle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/1PlayerSlayer/","209 products in account","Tomb Raider needs no introduction, it was a popular franchise back in the 90s, even if the gameplay of old was very difficult to get into.  When I was a child, I found the original series quite troublesome to play despite the core idea of solving intricate temple puzzles and exploring the uninhabited ancient tombs to be quite intriguing.  This reboot, reimagining, whatever you want to call it, though some may say remakes/-boots are becoming the norm and somewhat tiresome, despite it's flaws is still a somewhat welcome entry in the series.  It modernizes certain aspects and puts a new sheen on what I even thought was an ugly franchise back in the 90s.\n\nThe game knows exactly what it is, and recreates the PS1 FMVs and levels from 1995 with almost exact precision.  The FMVs of old were re-imagined in the in-game engine.  It is nostalgic to remember the cutscenes from '95, and how they were presented in pretty much the exact way.  It shows that Crystal Dynamics have paid attention to their source material in certain ways.  In saying that, it shows what this game was for -- the oldschool Tomb Raider fans.  I wasn't a HUGE Tomb Raider fan back in the 90s, but I enjoyed playing for how little I'd progress in them.  But since the reboot in 2013, I've become somewhat more of a fan, digging back into these reimaginings after finishing 2013 TR.\n\nAt any rate, the visuals are VERY passable.  This was made for the PS2/XBox generation, and in certain areas it shows, but it's very fitting.  The visuals uphold a certain style that can be considered timeless.  The environments and characters unify a certain style Crystal Dynamics was going for, and it probably could stand the test of time.  There are jaggies even under certain Anti-Aliasing settings, but the game certainly is not ugly.  The environments are colorful and presented very well, and all the levels have a distinct and interesting theme.\n\nThe "timlessness" vibe of the visuals also brings me to remember how cumbersome the controls and general TR game mechanics were back in the day.  In the PS1 games, the gameplay engine operated on a grid system -- which could be well seen through the outdated visuals, you could literally see textures cut off on the ground to show the grid on which Lara would operate.  In Anniversary, it's non-existent, but the climbing reminisces the difficult jumping of old.  Traversing cliff faces and making jumps can prove to be quite difficult and no matter your skill there will be times where you will die.  Either from the engine deciding to not let Lara grapple, or what I liked to call a "hard-coded" jump that is only made if certain placements or conditions are met.  There are times when it seems like the engine just says "nope" whenever you try to make a jump and she either falls short somehow, or decides not to grapple a ledge, no matter how HARD one can be mooshing down that grab button.\n\nI played with a mouse and keyboard, so that's pretty much why my pinky is so tired.  Using mouse for looking around is just a preference of mine, and I probably would've had a better time on pad, if I didn't use mouse-aiming for certain precise jumps.  You don't really ever have to aim to fire at enemies; there's auto-targetting reticules for that.  I used the mouse more for aiming my jumps than anything, and it seemed to help a bit in that department, even if my pinky (holding Ctrl) for grappling will probably help in developing carpal tunnel.  Some of the grapple hook segments can be wonky too.  So if you decide to play this game, be patient, get to know Lara's height and jump limits.\n\nThe game recreates a lot of the original's levels and cutscenes almost faithfully, and with a few twists -- for example, the T-Rex segment in the third stage has you fend off raptors before the beast himself stomps into the fray.  What's noteworthy (and may be eye-rolling to some) about big bosses throughout the game, is that you're presented with a "dodge-and-fire mechanic" in which you use to bring beasts into a wall, spikes, and so on.  It's a welcome addition to progress through the game, because I sucked combat in Tomb Raider as a kid and would die a LOT on boss segments.  Also most of the human-sized bosses have been boiled down to QTEs, which I don't have a problem with, they're to-the-point and are responsive, so it's just kind of a "whatever" kinda thing.  It doesn't pull a Bayonetta or God of War thing where you may miss a one-second response time -- time slows down and gives you ample opportunity to press it.  And with the context of the cutscenes, you shouldn't have a problem distinguishing which will have a QTE or not.\n\nAs mentioned, the game was developed for any TR fans that still existed for the time, with a more modern approach.  And certainly the climbing, jumping, and grapple hook segments proved to be very irritating at times.  Very late segments in the game were timed and you had to be precise with almost every button press or into the lava I would go.  But overall, satisfaction is still left after completing stages and the game, and there are collectibles and unlocks for any player willing enough to 100% such as outfits, artwork, commentary and so forth.\n\nI'd recommend even if you aren't a die-hard fan of Tomb Raider.  Though infuriating at times, the game gets more flack than is really deserved.  I certainly swore a couple times, but it's by no-means a punishing game.  Crystal Dynamics seemed to put love into this game, and tried to put a new formula to a dead grid-based exploration game.  Whether you choose pad or k+m, it's just a preference, because I'm sure no matter what you pick, certain fingers of yours will be tired.  Even still, give it a go if you're curious.","March 27","true","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now I will clarify now that I haven't played the original Tomb Raider game, mostly because I was barely even around when the game was released. So because of this, I will be reviewing the game as the single game that it is, and not as a remake as another game.\nTomb Raider: Anniversary definitely took me back to my younger years of gaming. Reminding me of the challenging titles I would spend countless hours playing; such as Spyro, Harry Potter and Crash Bandicoot. This game shows that there is more to gaming than just aiming and shooting at endless AI.\nTR: Anniversary takes you on a journey to four distinct locations: Peru, Greece, Egypt and the Lost Island, as you scale massive structures and defeat a variety of different enemies to recover the three pieces of Scion. This journey is divided into a series of chapters, each location having three or four each. Most chapters will take the average player around 10 - 15 minutes to complete depending on its size. On my first playthrough, it took me 09 hours 31 mins to complete the entire game, not including deaths, pauses and retries. That was on hard difficulty whilst also collecting all the collectibles as well.\nThe majority of the game you will find yourself scaling massive structures and navigating deadly paths. Although for the most part you will not encounter any problems, it is no secret that the game's sense of direction is a bit vague. Sometimes you can be looking directly at a ledge, but when you jump, Lara seems to decide that a more diagonal jump is required, meaning that she misses the ledge all together and inevitable falls to a squishy fate. However, due to the game's frequent checkpoint system, these frustrating moments tend to have minimal impact on the game as you are never more than a minute behind where you were before. The only time this does become an issue is when you are trying to complete the various time trials for each level. I can recall a number of times I had to restart an entire chapter due to this. I found that most errors can be compensated if you just take a little care when lining up your jumps.\nWhilst for the most part the game is pretty straight forward in where you need to go, I did find myself getting lost in larger more open areas. However, for the most part the game is quite linear and easy to follow. It's only when you need to backtrack or when something is hidden that you may need to stop and think for a bit. Overall, I found the game to not be to difficult, so you are not stuck trying to complete a single bit for hours, and not too simple that it doesn't require any thought at all. I think this was a near perfect balance for both enjoyment and satisfaction.\nWhilst navigating the world, Lara has various means of moving around. These are all explained in the early chapters of the game, and include wall running and swinging amongst some more obvious. After a while, these means of movement kind of feel old and overused as they are so few in number. You find yourself constantly swinging and wall running everywhere you go. I was disappointed to not see any vehicle sequences throughout the game, as I think this would have made an improvement to the game, and help to break up these large climbing areas - although I guess this was most common for a game of this age.\nThe combat in the game is broken into three categories; main combat, boss combat and quick time events. The majority of this combat will be done using the lock-on firing mode. My personal experience with this was much like the navigation in the world, it seemed to want to lock on to everything but the enemy. This made combat a little more frustrating as when there is a massive bear charging towards you and you keep shooting a switch the entire time it does kind of break the atmosphere. The game does also offer a manual firing mode, although I would strongly advise against this as the movement is very sluggish and Lara becomes rooted to the spot when in this mode - making you an easy target.\nMain combat makes up the majority in the game and is usually done with two or three low health enemies that run towards you. These range from from flying enemies to larger ground based enemies to rats! These enemies all work in mostly the same way: you fire a bunch of shots at it until it gets mad and charges at you, whereby then you, if timed correctly, enter a slow motion sequence where an insta-kill can be performed. Failing this, you could always just spam them with bullets till they drop.\nThe game doesn't offer many boss battles, but the ones that they do are largely varied based on who they are. You will usually take a couple minutes to figure out how this enemy works, and what their weaknesses are before you can start taking them down. I enjoyed the variety with these enemies as it wasn't just a shoot and dodge scenario. When I played the game, I was on hard difficulty and I was able to defeat most enemies pretty easily once I knew how they worked.\nThe last type of combat you will encounter is quick time events. These are, for the most part, rather fun and bad ♥♥♥. How these work is a cut scene will play for a bit, then it will begin a slow motion sequence where you then have to press the correct button that pops up on screen. These usually correspond to the in game controls, so for example, jump is A and so on. I enjoyed playing these as it helped give variety to the game's combat, but they were rather basic. Each event would consist of around three or so single buttons to press every few seconds. It would had been nice to maybe see some longer events like this, that have more complex buttons, but overall they were fun to play, even with how brief they were.\nNow it doesn't seem right to talk about achievements in a review, but since this is an achievement site it kind of does feel right. Having just completed this myself, I can tell you that this is a pretty easy game to complete, but you are going to need to put the work in. It should take around 10 - 12 hours to max whilst using a guide, and will require a minimum of two playthroughs, one on hard difficulty and collecting the collectables, and two, getting your running shorts on for some speed runs. Yes, there are collectables in the game but don't worry because there are only a handful on each level, with most appearing near enough along the main path anyway. Just use a guide, and there are plenty of them, and you should have no problems at all. Hard difficulty is not much of a challenge in my opinion. I haven't played the game on any other difficulty to provide some comparison, but I was able to complete this with little to no trouble at all. The majority of your gamerscore will come from completing sections of the game without dying - which sounds kind of tough. Well it is actually very easy if you frequently save, as whenever you die, just reload the save and bam, you never died.\nSo now it's time to draw this review to a close. I'm giving this title a four out of five, the only reason it didn't score a five is the technical problems it has that just holds it back a tiny bit, and causes you to scream at the TV a few more times than you should. Even with these bugs, I very much enjoyed playing the game, and have already downloaded Legend and Underworld ready to play hopefully very soon.\n*NOTE * This review was taken from my TrueAchievements profile (http://www.trueachievements.com/Tomb-Raider-Anniversary/reviews.htm#c891989) and was published 24 June 2015 at 22:52.","November 16, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/1PlayerSlayer/recommended/8000/","1PlayerSlayer","StrangeAxle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/1PlayerSlayer/","209 products in account","Tomb Raider needs no introduction, it was a popular franchise back in the 90s, even if the gameplay of old was very difficult to get into.  When I was a child, I found the original series quite troublesome to play despite the core idea of solving intricate temple puzzles and exploring the uninhabited ancient tombs to be quite intriguing.  This reboot, reimagining, whatever you want to call it, though some may say remakes/-boots are becoming the norm and somewhat tiresome, despite it's flaws is still a somewhat welcome entry in the series.  It modernizes certain aspects and puts a new sheen on what I even thought was an ugly franchise back in the 90s.\n\nThe game knows exactly what it is, and recreates the PS1 FMVs and levels from 1995 with almost exact precision.  The FMVs of old were re-imagined in the in-game engine.  It is nostalgic to remember the cutscenes from '95, and how they were presented in pretty much the exact way.  It shows that Crystal Dynamics have paid attention to their source material in certain ways.  In saying that, it shows what this game was for -- the oldschool Tomb Raider fans.  I wasn't a HUGE Tomb Raider fan back in the 90s, but I enjoyed playing for how little I'd progress in them.  But since the reboot in 2013, I've become somewhat more of a fan, digging back into these reimaginings after finishing 2013 TR.\n\nAt any rate, the visuals are VERY passable.  This was made for the PS2/XBox generation, and in certain areas it shows, but it's very fitting.  The visuals uphold a certain style that can be considered timeless.  The environments and characters unify a certain style Crystal Dynamics was going for, and it probably could stand the test of time.  There are jaggies even under certain Anti-Aliasing settings, but the game certainly is not ugly.  The environments are colorful and presented very well, and all the levels have a distinct and interesting theme.\n\nThe "timlessness" vibe of the visuals also brings me to remember how cumbersome the controls and general TR game mechanics were back in the day.  In the PS1 games, the gameplay engine operated on a grid system -- which could be well seen through the outdated visuals, you could literally see textures cut off on the ground to show the grid on which Lara would operate.  In Anniversary, it's non-existent, but the climbing reminisces the difficult jumping of old.  Traversing cliff faces and making jumps can prove to be quite difficult and no matter your skill there will be times where you will die.  Either from the engine deciding to not let Lara grapple, or what I liked to call a "hard-coded" jump that is only made if certain placements or conditions are met.  There are times when it seems like the engine just says "nope" whenever you try to make a jump and she either falls short somehow, or decides not to grapple a ledge, no matter how HARD one can be mooshing down that grab button.\n\nI played with a mouse and keyboard, so that's pretty much why my pinky is so tired.  Using mouse for looking around is just a preference of mine, and I probably would've had a better time on pad, if I didn't use mouse-aiming for certain precise jumps.  You don't really ever have to aim to fire at enemies; there's auto-targetting reticules for that.  I used the mouse more for aiming my jumps than anything, and it seemed to help a bit in that department, even if my pinky (holding Ctrl) for grappling will probably help in developing carpal tunnel.  Some of the grapple hook segments can be wonky too.  So if you decide to play this game, be patient, get to know Lara's height and jump limits.\n\nThe game recreates a lot of the original's levels and cutscenes almost faithfully, and with a few twists -- for example, the T-Rex segment in the third stage has you fend off raptors before the beast himself stomps into the fray.  What's noteworthy (and may be eye-rolling to some) about big bosses throughout the game, is that you're presented with a "dodge-and-fire mechanic" in which you use to bring beasts into a wall, spikes, and so on.  It's a welcome addition to progress through the game, because I sucked combat in Tomb Raider as a kid and would die a LOT on boss segments.  Also most of the human-sized bosses have been boiled down to QTEs, which I don't have a problem with, they're to-the-point and are responsive, so it's just kind of a "whatever" kinda thing.  It doesn't pull a Bayonetta or God of War thing where you may miss a one-second response time -- time slows down and gives you ample opportunity to press it.  And with the context of the cutscenes, you shouldn't have a problem distinguishing which will have a QTE or not.\n\nAs mentioned, the game was developed for any TR fans that still existed for the time, with a more modern approach.  And certainly the climbing, jumping, and grapple hook segments proved to be very irritating at times.  Very late segments in the game were timed and you had to be precise with almost every button press or into the lava I would go.  But overall, satisfaction is still left after completing stages and the game, and there are collectibles and unlocks for any player willing enough to 100% such as outfits, artwork, commentary and so forth.\n\nI'd recommend even if you aren't a die-hard fan of Tomb Raider.  Though infuriating at times, the game gets more flack than is really deserved.  I certainly swore a couple times, but it's by no-means a punishing game.  Crystal Dynamics seemed to put love into this game, and tried to put a new formula to a dead grid-based exploration game.  Whether you choose pad or k+m, it's just a preference, because I'm sure no matter what you pick, certain fingers of yours will be tired.  Even still, give it a go if you're curious.","March 27","true","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have to be very precise with your jumps and climbings, or you will die. A lot.  The puzzles with time levers are frustrating, since you have to do everything again if you don't make it on time, same with climbings that you have to go really fast with no mistakes. If you like backtracking, you are in the right place.\n\nThe plot was vague and most of the time I've found myself wondering why am I doing this? I would like seeing more background story or feedback from Lara herself, like in TRLegend or TR 2013.\n\nDespite of all the rage, solving puzzles and killing bosses was very satisfying.\n\nCroft Manor was fun but moving to one place to other took a lot of time. Too many empty hallways to the garden or the gym.\n\nThe game is lenghty, even more if you are not with the game mechanics.
