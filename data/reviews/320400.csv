For one, the interface makes it feel as though multiplayer was definitely a plan. There is a blank option box under "Singleplayer" and if they had never planned MP, why even make you choose singleplayer when it is the only option? I've played three full games and thus far the AI has not once chosen to attack one of my castles. They could have a "Perfect City" (castle with 5 shields) with 15 soldiers, 3 tanks and 3 planes and not attack my unshielded castle on a tile that generates revenue + soldiers. They'll leave it alone even as I'm attacking them, taking their land. The game itself is fairly fun and I could see myself enjoying they actual board game with friends who try to play versus AI who go out of their way to never challenge you. Unfortunately there is practically no replayability as there are no goals to work towards, no real challenge, no unlocks or accomplishments, and sadly not even local hotseat multiplayer.","April 12, 2015","false","2.9"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","27","28","0","1"

On top of the usual infantry, the players can use tanks that do massive damage, and planes that can bypass fortification defences. All three unit types can be upgraded with the use of cards that are acquired on pre-turn auctions.\n\nIn theory, it all sounds great, but in practise this is not a strategy game but a game of chance. Everything is random from territory values to battles: infantry can just fall down and die from nothing, and a malfunctioning tank can instantly wipe out an army regardless of its size.\nThe cards are chosen randomly, and being lucky enough to have a winning bid on, for example the one that can sacrifice an infantry to reduce city defences to nothing, can pretty much win the game by itself.\n\nMaybe if there would be multiplayer, it could salvage the game, because the computer either never attacks and gathers victory points behind safe walls, or gangs up on the player and steamrolls them. It’s just not fun to play Magnifico, because it is either boring or frustrating.","December 29, 2015","false","4.2"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","23","27","0","2"

If you win the auction, you will get to choose on of the cards.  But, the twist is, bid too much and the 2nd person gets their choice for a fraction of the cost - or drops out completely.\nThe AI seems to focus on defence - which is ok - but as you get closer to the victory point - doesn't try to use the poweful stacks it has built.\nWould be good with a multi-playerr or hot-seat option.\nPrice is excellent - but this could be a try before you buy and an occasional game.\nOverall - i like it and when i get 4 hrs clocked - will feel i've got value for money\n\nUpdate : The AI level is controlled by picking different characters to play against.  There is a list, and it shows 3\4 by default who seem to be unrated.  Scrolling down shows the higher rated characters.

No exciting bidding wars to distract from the drab gameplay here!) Combat uses some kind of weird dice system. You'd expect the tutorial to explain basic details like the dice odds, but no, it's too terrible. The tutorial seems to generally be pretty terrible, telling you what you CAN do without any basic instruction about the strategy behind what you SHOULD do.

The game is actually pretty simple, but plays really well, and the projects that you can buy are a nice way to make the game funnier.

The game can be challenging if you're playing with the harder bots, but, if not, it can actually be pretty straightforward and easy. All you have to do is understand how to get those points and win. The game actually should have other win conditions, like conquering, or things like that.\n\nThe fact that the game does not have multiplayer is a big turn-off, but you still can have some fun with it.

That's Magnifico in a nutshell. A niftly little strategy game where you conquer territory, use da Vinci's genius to make your troops more powerful, and then throw these troops at each other to grab more territory and earn victory points.\nMy primary gripe with the game is that there are no game modes. Every game end when 30, 40, or 50 points are earned through strength and number of castles, empire size, times you were the top bidder on his projects (the Magnifico) and the number of his projects you were able to purchace (double for Works of Art, a nice addition). You can't toggle the options, you can't go for a domination victory, or an economic voctiry, or a culture victory. It's all Victory Points, all the time.\nFortunately the game board is randomized each time, making the game very replayable. I'd say it's best as one of those games you boot up when you need to kill some time while your laundry is running.

It feels like Risk with a twist, but I find Magnifico a lot more appealing since I don't particularly like Risk.\n\nIt has a good tutorial and the rules are always one click away. There are several strategies you can deploy to win the game, but you will always have to use all available mechanics. You need money to get stuff and troops to defend your territories, and technology to gain extra points and upgrade your economy.\n\nScoring is according to "the more" you have. More lands, more castles, more upgraded castles and more tech cards. On your turn you may move troops, invade empty lands, attack enemies, build castles or siege weapons, and activate upgrades. The actions are limited by number of uses and the amount of gold available. Controlled lands supply fixed troops and/or gold every turn. The map is generated randomly at the beginning of the game. A land may either produce 30 gold and 0 troops, or 10 gold and 2 troops every turn, for example. Siege weapons ("tanks" and "planes") allow you to counter tech cards and fortifications.\n\nIt is a simple game to pick up but still manages to deliver a bit of a challenge and get you engaged. I actually find it very relaxing.\n\nThe only downside, and single reason I don't recommend it to everyone, is that it has no multiplayer for some reason. It feels nonsensical since it is a board game adaptation, but still, if you have no friends or just want to fiddle around a better Risk like, without delving into the pits of Hearts of Iron and the likes of grand strategy in terms of world conquering, this is a simple and interesting game.\n\nWhile completely different in mechanics, I'd say that if you enjoyed other boardgame adaptations like Ticket to Ride or Smallworld 2 (not Talisman, that game is a chore) in the sense of slow paced casual fun, you might also like this.","May 17, 2015","true","2.3"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Three major improvements over Risk:A massive army won't win you the game. Your infantry spawns in specific places, and trying to get them to your front lines takes time. Also, you can't attack with more than 6 infantry anyway (though you can add up to 6 tanks/planes to that army if you can afford it, for a maximum of 12 attacking units).\nUpgrades! Each turn Leonardo Da Vinci offers a certain number of upgrades to the players, and the highest bid gets first pick. This can make your units more powerful, give you extra VPs per turn, and so on.\nVictory points are cumulative. If, for example, you have a perfect city, it doesn't give you 1 VP. It gives you 1 VP per turn that you own it. This means that the game doesn't go on forever!{/olist}\n\nThere are two negatives to the game, however.\nFirstly, the rules aren't as clear as they could be. For example, I don't know how to make a perfect city - it was never explained in the tutorial and a quick skim through the help docs didn't give me an explanation. I'm sure it's in there somewhere, but it should have been clearer.\nSecondly, there's no multiplayer at the moment! This really sucks, as I'm sure this game would be so much better with multiplayer, even local hotseat. There's so much wasted potential just by not including multiplayer, and it's a real shame.\n\nIn summary: If you like area control games like Risk, but wish it was a bit more varied and interesting, give this game a look. If no multiplayer is a dealbreaker for you, look elsewhere.","April 12, 2015","true","7.4"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

I've honestly enjoyed this game and I was probably one of the first people to pick it up when it was released on Steam and didn't expect so many negative reviews for this game.\n\nThe gameplay in my opinion are fantastic, you make a bid every round and if you win, you get first pick to Da Vinci's various war machines and get to go first. There are multiple ways to achieve victory points, such as having the most provinces, or building up castles. Around four maps and three settings the amount of victory types with multiple AI types to choose from. Graphics are pleasing and the gameplay is calm. This game was very useful for nights I didn't feel like sleeping and just skirmished with the AI.\n\nIn my opinion, Magnifico is a great game, and its well polished and well done for the price.","July 13, 2015","true","19.1"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

It is far better then most of the $10 games I have bought, more worked on, more detailed, it is a $20 game with multiplayer missing.  I love the art, music, game play (like an Euro Risk, what Risk wished it had been).\n\nDo you recommend this game at 5$ - YES, it's AWESOME !\nDo you recommend this game at 10$ - Yes it's Great!\nDo you recommend this game at 20$ - Yes/no depends, do you like board games?\nDo you recommend this game at 40$ - NO, not worth it !\n\nP.S.

It took a while for me to get used to the gameflow, but I'm finding myself to be really enjoying it.\n\nI got this as part of a humble bundle and I was pleasantly surprised. The interface is pleasant and relatively easy to use.\n\nI do get the gripe about the lack of multiplayer. I thought I had simply received the "cheap" version because I bought it through the humble bundle. It would be great if they release an update with multiplayer.\n\nI don't know what other players are saying about the AI: you have to play the harder AIs to be attacked...","June 2","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
