It's a mix of Binding Of Isaac and Relic Hunters Zero (which is free and you should check it out before buying this). The game has many unique enemies which get harder as the game progresses. You will feel like you are playing Binding Of Isaac for the first time having to discover what items do. Character and enemy design is really good too, they have a lot of different attacks and will surprise you a lot. 9/10 from me.","April 10","true","5.3"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

I'd highly reccomend for people that enjoy top down shooters in the vein of SmashTV and Total Carnage.","April 11","true","19.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Even thought i was a beta tester long before the game was released, I still often play this game, and im still not sick of the game because this is a rogue-like game. Don't give up because u feel like the game is too hard! You probably just need to do some angled projectiles and keep moving. I have created a gameplay video on youtube, feel free to help yourselves to find out how to beat an particularly hard enemy.\nGreat game, great music, great graphics. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is reading this.","April 11","true","24.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NekroG/recommended/448090/","NekroG","Nekro G","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NekroG/","614 products in account","Awesome Music opens up, opening menu looks very generic, No press enter or space bar to select, think it should say that somewhere most people think enter to start, and it was space.\nGame is sort of like Smash TV without Diagnol shooting, I kind of wish it did have diagnol shooting. Character is ok, No backstory tho. That could of gave the game some more insight. Tutorial was Decent, but the items just seemed to small.\nThe Idea of moving around in computer chips was a good one, and the attacking files etc make the game kind of fun for a nerd like myself.\nI found the Gameplay fun for the most part, the hit detection kinda sucks tho, takes forever to try to hit something, shouldnt be this hard.\nThe Art is decent, I like the Blue Screen of death ending, but cant lie it scared the crap out of me for a second lol.\nI do like that it has a save feature and multiple save slots.","April 12","true","0.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Well, the point is, the music is great.\n\nOh, plus there's a doge monster in the game. Yeah, that doge, so hip, wow, many bytes.","April 8","true","3.8"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","50","14","28","5","1"

You can probably expect to see hundreds of hours in this game in the future, but this dev and this game need to be recognised by more people.
