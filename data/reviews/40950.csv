"http://steamcommunity.com/id/teadrinkinglooney/recommended/40950/","teadrinkinglooney","Teadrinkinglooney","http://steamcommunity.com/id/teadrinkinglooney/","162 products in account","Overview\nAhh, Stronghold... A slice of nostalgia, and a damn fun game to boot. I'm going to go on a bit of a rant here, to be perfectly honest, so for anyone remotely interested in this game I'll give you a quick overview right now. Stronghold is a classic real time strategy game with a focus on replayability, base building/management and careful positioning over the micromanaging tactics that tend to dominate many RTS games today. If that sounds up your street, I'd buy it at full price. The game is WELL worth £3.50 and I must have sunk at least 40 hours into creating new and interesting siege maps and swapping them with my friends to challenge one another alone.\n\n8/10\n\nOnto the more detailed rundown...\n\nGraphics\nUmmm... Yeah, this isn't why you should be playing this game. It was made back in the early 2000's, and it looks like it. This 'HD remake' does little to help it there. There's no reworking of the graphics or anything like that, and the opening cinematic still plays in a hilariously tiny box in the middle of a great big black void. Fortunately, in-game itself is treated very nicely indeed with the new resolutions... There's definitely a charm to the animations, and the little details like the cinematics that play out on your minimap when you select certain buildings or to mark events are welcome... But there's not much here to recommend beyond the rustic medieval design of the game's interface as a whole, which still stands up to some degree despite the game's age. I suppose one bonus of this is that you certainly won't have to worry about upgrading your rig to meet any requirements...\n\n3/10\n\nStory\nSo we're talking about the campaign then! Honestly, the campaign isn't why I ever played this game... But it helps. Particularly on returning to it, I'm surprised at how good the campaign story gets once you get into later sections. This is a simple story of revenge and honour in a historically ambigious version of England. And yet the game does manage to go beyond a simple framework that leads your nameless character from point A to point B to fight Lord C because... Well because Daddy issues. No, it actually manages to create something that you can invest in to an odd degree. Mostly though it's use of larger than life, fun characters.\nYour two main advisors are a fun pair of Lords that bounce off each other in a way that's mildly amusing, but it's primarily the villains of the game that get the best moments. The four lords, The Rat, The Snake, The Pig and The Wolf (going by their nicknames) are each clearly defined, given backgrounds and range from freaking hilarious to pathetic to loathsome. The game does a great job throughout of giving you great reason to want to crush these four villains both in and out of gameplay itself, with the dialogue not stopping once your in-game itself. (Apparently medieval Skype calls were a thing. Who knew?)\nThe voice acting for these parts is... Well, this is going to be the divisive bit. It works for me, in an odd way. But if you've got any kind of ear for actors, you're quickly going to pick up on the fact that there's basically one, maybe two (three at a push) guys voicing EVERYTHING IN THE GAME. And yes, I said guys quite intentionally, as this includes the women. The game, however, appears to be well aware of this deficiency and plays it up for all it's worth (Most notably in the case of the mother's wondering around your keep who let you know how lovely the morning is in their best Monty Python impersonation) with some success. It's a matter of taste, but I find it pretty entertaining, and within the campaign itself it does add a kind of charm to the whole proceedings in regards to the storytelling nature of it's plot.\n\n7/10 (6/10 if you don't appreciate hilarious voice acting.)\n\nGameplay\nAh. Here we go. This is what it's all about. Simply put, Stronghold is a fantasticly fun RTS. There are a variety of units that serve basic purposes, but the game knows not to go too far with it. When the time of a siege is approaching fast and you only have limited moments to decide whether to split your resources between your economy, your castle walls or your military, it's important that you know exactly what every soldier is there to do. The game does an excellent job of setting up a simple, but useful roster of troops to choose from. Without going into extreme detail here, just be aware that this is one game where zerg swarming the weakest units isn't going to get you very far if you're trying to siege anything beyond a very basic wooden set-up... Not if the defender is at all smart with their pitch and engineer set up, that is...\nThere are counters to pretty much any unit type, and as of such this often becomes a game of out manouvering your opponent or careful planning rather than sudden quick decisions. The siege mode which is entirely focused on the combat and a single siege (obviously) is certainly more exciting in that sense, but even during battles the game is not a fast-paced affair. It is exciting primarily in the scale and degree of strategy you must deploy to break through seemingly impregnable sets of walls and defences, or ensure that those damn trebutchet don't get set up out of your archers and crossbowmen's range... And if they do, whether it's worth sacrificing your precious few knights in a charge to try and destroy them this early on. All in all, Stronghold is an oddly relaxing game inbetween battles. Every decision matters, but the game's soothing soundtrack and charming graphics, combined with the focus on placement and management over micromanaging and quick reflexes gives it a very laidback feeling compared to a lot of modern RTS installments. If you haven't played a game like this before, this may seem a bit 'off' to begin with, but give it some time and I think you'll soon grow to appreciate it. Unless, of course, you're a twitch gaming junkee that just needs his next fix, in which case why are you even looking at an RTS review? You weirdo. Sheesh.\nOh and I suppose we should talk about replayability. You want to talk about replayability? This game comes out, walks up to most games that talk about replayability and just slaps them across the face and then suplexes them into the corner, screaming like it's Hulk Hogan and the Ultimate Warrior's unholy love child. Stronghold's map creator is probably one of it's best features. The base maps themselves within the siege and invasion modes are already great fun, but the map creator allows you to basically do whatever you like, however. It's a standard other RTS games should look to achieve.\nIf I were to lay any complaints at the floor of Stronghold's gameplay, they would all come from dated limitations. It is possible to flatten the world and look at structure layout by pressing spacebar, which helps make sure that you haven't missed any gaps but camera positioning IS an issue. For the most part, it's fine, but I am now spoilt by modern games that give full use of a camera that allows seemless positioning and zooming. This game allows you to switch between looking at the map from four different directions when you hold down right click and select a compass. And yes, I know that I've been particularly fair on the game given it's age before this point, but this IS the game's one major failing. It's not a big one, honestly, but it's one that should be mentioned. All I can say is, thank god they thought to add in the spacebar option.\n\n8/10\n\n\nStronghold is a very good game. Have I said that yet? I think I have. Maybe I'll say it again? Yes. Stronghold is a very good game, any limitations it has mostly come down to the game's age, but with this HD remake it's greatest limitations (actually being able to play the damn thing on a modern computer screen) have been fixed. I would HEAVILY recommend it given it's reaonable to the point of criminal price.","July 10, 2014","true","3.1"," 92 of 96 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","92","96","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/40950/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","This is a long review, so if you just want a summary of why I recommend Stronghold HD then skip to the Results section and reading from there.\n\nFirefly Studios makes a brilliant castle simulator game, Stronghold. Then over ten years later they bring it back in HD, finally you can play this epic on modern machines. For those who never played a Stronghold game and for veterans alike this is a great game to get into.\n\nStory:\nThis game is based on its campaign; a very interesting story involving you, a young man, bringing down the monstrous villains who murdered your father in cold blood. You embark on this quest with a small band of soldiers still loyal to your father to retake the kingdom. With a few allies along the way you vanquish the foes of the king one by one. In this epic campaign you meet series’ most notorious villains The Rat, The Snake, The Pig, and The Wolf; each one of these criminals crueler than the last.\n\nGameplay:\nThis game introduces basic elements of castle simulation, mostly focusing on combat. You construct a castle, manage taxes, harvest resources, and construct weapons. In order to bring about this balance you must maintain popularity and income within your castle. Villagers will move in until your houses are full and you've got to make sure you can support them.\n\nCampaign:\nSome of the missions are near impossible even on the easiest difficulty. On the other hand some missions are so mind-numbingly easy even on the hardest difficulty. There are no achievements for this game and cheating is always an option. In order to beat the Pigs Castle the second time I had to use cheats (the gold cheat) so I keep building new catapults with my Engineers. The map took me for ages to beat, but other than that one mission the rest of the game was rather simple.\n\nHint:\nI would recommend shifting the game speed throughout missions. When you start each missions putting it at the lowest speed, 10. Then once you've got all your buildings in place raise the speed up to 30 or 40. When you know you have won the map move the speed up to 90 again in order to speed up the victory process.\n\nResults:\nIf you like city builders, enjoy real time strategy combat, and prefer macro-managing to micromanaging then this is the game for you. I would recommend this game regardless of whether it is on sale or not, its a great game and you can easily get 12-hours out of the campaign alone. For an older generation game Stronghold is leaps and bounds beyond its competition.\n\nPros:\n+You not only build a castle, but you also manage it politically.\n+Military units require villagers as well as weapons/armor in your armory.\n+The campaign offers a very riveting story that takes you across the Great Britain.\n+The combat is rather intense and can require the usage of multiple siege tools.\n+The market allows you to buy and sell goods in order to meet tough deadlines.\n\nCons:\n-Sieging a castle can be near impossible unless you outnumber your enemy 100:1\n-Some missions basically require you to cheat in order to win.\n-Building an army quickly can be ridiculously hard because of the prerequisites (most missions I built a market and bought weapons rather than building them myself).\n-No skirmish mode\n-Poor unit mapping, many times units will spread out rather than clump causing enemy archers to shoot them (units hit by arrows will stand in position until they die rather than move themselves to avoid being hit).","February 27, 2014","true","16.2"," 94 of 103 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","94","103","0","0"

It was clear from the beginning that the devs put a lot of nuance and original thought in this game. The campaign is really fun and brings a lighthearted story as you build your castle and prevent it from being overrun.\n\nThe music is excellent and brings an authentic mood and flavour to this game, as does the voice acting.\n\nThe graphics are dated but as a medieval castle sim they aren't a drawback. The HD rerelease adds very little to it, however.\n\nAs I'm sure the publisher found out this game proved to be successful and they released a string of games in this series. Quite honestly the move to 3D didn't do much and actually took away from the authentic feeling that came with this game. I didn't find the 3D graphics that good in the 2nd stronghold. The crusader series was equally interesting and unique and the Crusader Extreme release was insanely frustrating and crazy what with the AI rushes.\n\nThe only maddening thing about this game is that sometimes it is difficult to accurately gauge where to build stone for your castle wall. You sometimes need to draw down the wall option to allow you to see the ground, because I have spent hours building a castle only to have it overrun in seconds because the enemy AI ran through a small breach that was otherwise undetected. Other than that a very good game overall.

Penney","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197967643963/","232 products in account","I wanted to give a quick review for once, but I could not, so the first paragraph is for those who want it fast.\n\nTo be quick & frank: I wanted to play this as a teenager when it came out, and I never got to. As the franchise developed over the years I quickly lost interest as reviews basically warded me off. Recently Stronghold HD came up as a flash sale on steam for some thing like $1.67, and remembering that I never had the chance in my youth I said "why the ♥♥♥♥ not! It's only the cost of a coffee!". I have not been dissapointed at all. As far as being an HD release, it's optimized, bugless (at least so far and I'm 8+ hours in), and seems to have all it's assets there (nothing seems to be cut from what I gather), it's about as good of an HD-Re-release as AoE 2 has been and I've had countless hours of nostalgic fun with that title.\n\nThe rest of this review is simply trying to sell it to those who've never played it, or have experiances with similer games like AoE 2.\n\nStronghold puts you in the position of a lord, you build your castle, and you essentially play 'wave defence' threwout the campaign protecting said lord unit, while that isn't the only mode the game offers an 'economic campaign', instant siege, freebuild, etc. It isn't quite the same RTS layout as much of the genre has created, but almost half of a city / supply management game combined with specific aspects of medieval combat and primitive RTS atributes, it isn't actually as simple as I'm making it out to sound, for example to build bow units, one must have a supply of wood, then have a fletcher, he will deposite units of bow into your armory, in which then you can subtract from your unemployed towns people and spend the gold to create the unit, in which the bow in your arsenel becomes used up, and same goes for some foods, ale is a two stage process and wheat is a three stage process, luckily the game diversifies with food types, as well as material types. You have many more resources then a general RTS, but they aren't very complicated and any one who gets a few concepts of the mideval ages shouldn't have any problem grasping the concepts.\n\nCombat & units: There is unit control, but there isn't worker control (You just have to build the woodcutters hut, not specifically tell a guy to go cut wood such as in AoE), you will have to shift your men around to defend your castle walls, and there is a plethora of objects to build, all with different functions. There is several different classes of units ranging from basic archers to knights. Siege units are also avialable from ballista to catapult. Unit control is primitive for its time but you can still patrol and move; to be honest and true to my word- the AI is generally very good especially for 2001, for example when you station spearmen on the wall and even tell them to patrol, as ladders raise and the enemy climbs, they automatically find the closest targets all along said wall and deal with and dispatch them however they best should at the time- FOR ONCE YOU REALLY DON'T NEED TO MICRO MANAGE YOUR MEN!!!!, in short: tell your units which towers and walls to cover, thats it. Ctrl Groups can be set (Ctrl + Num). Honestly theres still more defences in this game that I'm learning as I go, but the basics are all there, spike traps, hot oil. Missile units gain height advantage; especially in your towers! Walls actually deflect arrows and give your men HUGE survability bonuses. It's definetly not as quick feeling as a lot of other RTS games are, you generally have a lot of time to rethink things or shift men around if need be, the game speed can be adjusted in the options of course but the units don't quite feel as responsive/quick to move as other RTS's, but they aren't bad in any regards either especially after a few movements with a group has adjusted your perception of how quickly the games actually moving.\n\nCampaign: The game offers 2 as I'm aware of, one leaning heavy on combat and defence while the other economic based- though I haven't played it. It's a crude campaign, heavy in story and sequences, the voice acting really screams '2001 game from left field!' as some of the characters are more annoying then interesting, and most of it is how the characters overall present themselves, it could have been much better written, there really isn't anything poetic about the campaign or most of the cast. The first few missions as I mention somewhere else in the review, will 'hold your hand' and present little challange but to build a handful of resource or a dozen men to dispatch wolves. Very very quickly does the difficulty ramp up, it can be adjusted before every mission but you won't know what 'difficult' is until you're nearly completed a mission and suddenly lose it very quickly due to your arrangement of defences or how and what resources you managed first. Dated but still enjoyable campaign.\n\nResource & worker mangmnt: is overall primitive but quick to grasp every concept as you discover which buildings work with what, the game also offers an in depth help psuedo-wiki with essential concepts of the game and general things to keep in mind while building defences and expanding yourself. There is also a trade building, it doesn't seem to have a persistant economy but really you won't want it with the ammount of gold you'll pull in, while you can make a lot, generally your living conditions will deter you less you have the food to fill the bellies or the aesthetics / fear factor built into your castle. Your peasents will have a general opinion of you, and there are buildings you can construct as well as decorations that will remind them of how nice or horrid of a ruler you are. Both concepts add two distinct and different aspects though, fear or 'bad things' will boost your workers effeciancy but lower your opionion while 'nice things' and being pleasent will only add to your overall opinion- but also cost gold and take up very limited space!\n\nThe building some times does get quite constrictive, especially in the campaign for the first few missions (they almost seem like half a tutorial that presents 3 'gimmie' missions where you essentially don't really have to do anything but figure out how economy works), and there are certain areas of the map you cannot build in (reinforcement points / town limits). While I do say there is a bit of managment, it's almost minimal and it's quite simplified, the learning curve is very small.\n\nThe last part I wanted to mention was the overall castle building. It is vast and while primitive and dated, allows for some very customized defences. Every crenulation you add to your walls as well as how thick you decide to build or extend them will add to your survival averages, as well as initial building placement and workflow. 2001 did not have very complex games overall, but this was definetly way ahead of it's time, especially in the defensive building style of RTS's. Another strong aspect of this game is the ability to 'hide' or 'lower' your walls for viewing / fine building purposes, you can either force the 3D terrain to become 'flat' or simply show everything as 2D tiles, this allows you to really fine tune / delete specific segments of wall and generally beautify the ♥♥♥♥ out of your castle without too much frustration and fretting.\n\nOverall;, I would definetly recommend this title to any one who is even slightly a fan of castle / city builders, at full price of $7 CDN dollars, If you were a fan of the core concepts of AoE 2 you will definetly get your monies worth if not ending up loving it!\n\nCon: Biggest con worth mentioning is that since it's a game from a much older time, and I know it is because of coding of the original engine that it could not be enhanced/fixed is the map size is overall small for RTS's, 400x400 I believe is the largest you can have, which actually is fairly big in this game, it isn't quite the massive 10 player battle sized maps of AoE 2 or Empire Earth.","April 27","true","21.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","2"

B eback soon.\n\nEDIT 1: November 2015\nThe AI is really noticeably bad now. Soldiers will often ignore their attack/defence stance. The unit pathing is horrible.\n\nEDIT:\nI got drunk today and ended up making a society centred around beer and religion. The goal of the campaign mission is to capture a castle and convert 75% of the populace. So I put a brewery district in with the church distrcit. Everyone was so drunk and stumbling. It was fun and there was a garden too and so everyone was happy but then the quarry workers were barely working and when they came back from their break the ox handlers went for a beer and so yeah. I ended up with thousands of gold, bread and cheese. Also the ghost was, "watching over me." Sick pervert.\n\n\nOriginal:\nI highly recommend this game. Not that any one will see, as I have no friends on STEAM. I have put hundreds of hours in to this game in the past decade and was glad to play it again, especially in a HD version, even though the game is merely in higher resolution on the machine I play on and not 1080P.\n\nThe immersion is strong, especially on a higher difficulty during a lengthy mission. Some missions are short and once they are completed once and a tactic is found, they can be boring if played by that same tactic and there is only so many times you can re-play a mission, but I digress because there are always new ways to play missions, such as positioning your castle eslewhere, focusing on castle construction, public happiness, particular soldiers and even though I put no stock on it, you can save up 10,000 gold and build 150 churches and convert everyone, (at least it does not name any religions, just dribbles on about marriages, woot.) I actually ended up playing one of the campaign mission maps for about fifty hours, converting the entire map in to a castle based economy because it was set on a never ending loop until a specific goal was achieved; it is very fun.\n\nThe game has a huge amount of things to do, such as food based economy where one must build a wheat farm primarily, then have the wheat milled in to flour where a baker can then bake bread. There are also many types of military units that require different smelting, smithing and builders. The castle walls and towers come in many shapes and sizes and can awesomely be manned, and on the attacking side can be mined out, trebuchet attacked, knocked down, scaled with ladders, just like Helms Deep, minus a horn of Helm Hammerhand. The flora and fauna is moderately abundant and also provide a challenge, such as bears and wolves that regularly attack you.\n\nThe main campaign is very fun, al-though I admittedly have never completed the final mission, which is testament to the level of difficulty, especially when you set it to 'very hard.' Hours of fun in these missions alone.\n\nNext is the siege that missions which require you to either defend a pre-built castle from a siege with pre-chosen and spawned soldiers, or to choose your offensive military might and besiege a castle. I have more played as defence for I find that fun, but both are deceptively fun and once you get in to the thick of it, you may find it hard to turn the game off. There is also an economic campaign, which is shorter, harder and more economy based, hence the name. One can also play maps made in the...\n\nSCENARIO EDITOR. Yes. Un-like games like Age of Empires, Age of Mythology and Empire Earth, this game has a very straight forward scenario editor which is so user friendly and fun to the extent of being able tomake ones own campaign featuring events, talking, and user-made maps, lacking only the ability to do menial options such as write ones own text, (or have I just not noticed I can, yet?)\n\nMulti-player; nope. I care not.\n\nCons; only cons are little annoyances in the game, such as the non-ability to build with-in a distance of enemy units, tethered with the lack of ability to delete things around enemy units too. Some of ones own units can now and then become stuck in or on a building, especially if you place a building such as a wall right in-front of them. Corners can be a bit picky, so you may on occasion build the greatest castle ever and then watch an entire enemy army walk through a 1m space wall you missed and destroy your castle in seconds, which is ones own fault, bringing to light an actual pro; architectural construction is a big part of the game.\n\nIf you enjoy RTS at all, PLAY THIS GAME. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. :)\n\n\nNow go away or I shall taunt you a second time.","December 8, 2013","true","47.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/savevage/recommended/40950/","savevage","kys","http://steamcommunity.com/id/savevage/","39 products in account","If your a person that cares about graphics or hate old games, leave immediately.\n\nStrongholdHD was the first game in the series taking place in medieval Europe. I highly reccomend you play this game before getting any other stronghold game. Its a strategy based castle building game released about 15 years ago back at 2001. Its really old, but that doesnt make it a bad game. AMAZING music and voice acting. You will also learn a thing or to from StrongholdHD This game was like smoking weed when I first got it. If your tolerant of old games, and like what I said above, I highly reccomend it for you. Its price is a bit too high for a old game at 7-8(UDS) on steam, but you can also wait for a sale, or go to a trustful website that sells games really cheap. They have really good prices, and it actaully works.(I got all my total war games with  for a cheap price, but you cant refund them)\n\nYou basicly have 3 modes. Combat, Economic, and Map Editor. The other tab is basicly saves. Combat is basicly for people who want to get right on into battles, sieges, and campaign. Economic is more peacful as you fufill orders in a certain amount of time like making weapons, troops, food, ect. Map Editor you can create or own maps. Saves is self explanatory.\n\nIn the military campaign, you take on a lord whose kingdom was beaten back by 3 forces, the rat, the snake, the pig, and the wolf.(Please correct me if im wrong, I haven't played this in a long time) You start to retake counties from the 3 enemies. All of this is taking place in the UK looking map I belive. So the game starts of from starting off small with pity archers and spear men with wood palisade walls to mace man, crossbowmen, with stone walls. As the game progresses, it teaches you slowly, rewards you with new buildings and troops. Really this is the reason why I reccomend to play this game first. Games like Stronghold Crusader dont tutor you like a newb. They think you know how to play the game. The only bad thing I find about this is that theres barely any siege for you, and if there is, its freaken huge for a beginner sieger.\n\nThen we have siege battles, premade castles for you to siege, or defend. Theres a ton of maps to choose from. I think almost all of them are historical and gives information about each siege. I actaully learned that the London tower was actaully a castle at first. Interesting.\n\nInvasion basicly invades more than a castle. So if you have villages or forts around your castle, its an invasion. Again, alot of maps and historically accurate for some.\n\nEconomic is really simple and more peaceful, expect for wolves. You get orders to build troops, weapons, food in a limited amount of time. You will get obstacles like plague, theives, but its really not a big deal. I reccomend playing this after military.\n\nMap editor is a sandbox. You can free build your castle without any mace men tearing up your walls, OR, Build your map, make your levels. You can adjust the terrain, add trees, troops, oceans, rivers, rocks, resources, really in depth and nice. I belive you cant make your own 1000v1000 battles but I think you can do it in Stronghold Crusader.\n\nSaves. Well this is what pisses me off. You have to manually save your games. It's 100 percent my fault, but make sure you SAVE your game.\n\nAS far as multiplayer goes, you will need to have GameRanger and even if you have it, theres barely any games, but Stronghold CrusaderHD as a ton of multiplayer games.\n\nStrongholdHD is a game that requires tolerence in order to enjoy. If you like old classic medieval castle building games, this is for you. If your looking to get into other stronghold games, play this. I will make a review on Stronghold Crusader soon because thats considered the best game in the series.\n\n(If I made any grammar mistakes, did or say anything wrong, or dont agree with me, feel free to comment below.)","February 29","true","30.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theodeo/recommended/40950/","theodeo","Vic Vinegar - Pro Bodyguard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theodeo/","418 products in account","Unlike other RTS games there is a big focus on creating something cool.\n\nEverything is centred around the layout, walls and defences of your Stronghold. You can go major OCD about building the perfect castle, except, unlike other games stuff takes a few seconds to build as opposed to ♥♥♥♥ing forever. You could spend 3 days making castles this cool in minecraft or you could do it in 5 minutes here and actually have hundreds of dudes manning your walls, throwing boiling pots of oil on people and all that jazz.\n\nThere isn't much economy micro. Villagers can't be controlled or assigned. You place a building and it is created instantly, then a villager is automatically assigned to it and goes and does their ♥♥♥♥. keep them happy and more villagers will come, ♥♥♥♥ them off and they will leave, don't give them a job and they will just sit around eating your food.\n\nEverything is done in real time, make a wheat farm and a villager will grow wheat, cut it into bundles, physically take the bundles to your stockpile, people will come from a mill and take the bundles back with them, then take the flour they make back to the stockpile which bakers will pick up, take to a bakery then deliver bread to your granary. You can see the piles of bread in your granary building and watch as they get eaten.\n\nThis compliments the whole theme of the game, layout is what's important. If your bakeries are far away from your granary then you won't get as much bread, same for most of the buildings in the game.\n\nIt's also the perfect game for people who like to turtle like ♥♥♥♥ and amass hundreds of troops before even poking the enemy. Resulting in huge sieges. Defence is super strong so you need a lot of guys to take down a good castle.\n\nSo it's an RTS for people who like to turtle and don't enjoy lots of micro. It's still super easy to get flustered though and if you play multiplayer then you probably still need to know build orders and all that stuff, LOTS of resource management, down to building individual weapons for your troops.\n\nAI is pretty wank.\n\nAll in all it holds up well to someone who never played the game before it was HDified.\n\nNo steamworks multiplayer though, or even steam overlay.","January 8, 2014","true","28.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

The story also wasn't too bad and I enjoyed seeing my progress through the land, seeing how my power grew (and occasionally shrank).\n\nThe "boss fights" (if you can call them that) when you defeat the one of the 4 rival kings is really fun and beating the levels is always satisfying, especially during some of those photo finishes which you're bound to experience.\n\nEvery time someone asks me, "Hey, do you know of any medieval simulation games where I can play as a king and simulate a siege on enemy territories and defeat the Wolf?"

My dad hears me and says "Total War is better". I knew he was just jealous of my devotion for Stronghold. I called him a filthy peasant. He puts my granary on half rations and sends me to go to sleep. I'm crying now and my peasants are leaving. I lay in bed and its really cold. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch me. Its the scribe, i'm so happy. He whispers in my ear "A message m'lord". He grabs me with his powerful scribe hands and puts me on my hands and knees. I'm ready. I open my gates for the scribe and he enters my castle. It hurts so much but I do it for the scribe. I can feel my castle tearing as my eyes start to water. I push against his force, I want to please the scribe. He roars a mighty roar as he fills my stockpile. My dad walks in.

Even after like, what, 12 years from this game's release the graphics, gameplay and experience are still awesome for me. After a few years of not playing it, nostalgia kicks back in and thank goodness Steam has it when I decided to install Steam as one of my game hubs to base my games on. Even though it's has no flashy graphics like Starcraft: Wings of Liberty or Call of Duty, the graphics have most certainly endured. Even I don't know why. Maybe it's because the experience made up for it, or maybe the detail that goes to each building and terrain defies ravages of time. The gameplay, especially if you're into management and simulators like let's say Age of Empires and its similar counterparts like Warcraft, this will DEFINITELY be a breath of fresh air for you. I guarantee it!! After actually playing this game, I couldn't go back to Age of Empires II because as great as Age of Empires is, it simply became lackluster and it's like you had your fill of it and there's nothing new, you know? But Stronghold. It's amazing after a decade I still can replay a game and still feel like I've never played it. Maybe it's because the game as a whole actually FEELS REAL. You see little people, doing their merry little jobs, greeting you if you click on them, and every single one of the living creature has their own name. The logic in this game is absolutely fantastic; it gets you to think how content the people are, how fast the jobs' going to be done, how soon do you need to consider managing the food rations......It feels REAL.\n\nThe campaigns are great with a good pace of difficulty, and one of the most amazing trait of this game that amuses me and still makes me smile to this day is how every single character with a voice seems to be voiced by the same guy - and all of them still sounds so different!! Of course they could have added more kinds of dialogues or add even more stuff to make the game more difficult and more real now that I've played it for so long. But then it'll be too hard for the starters, wouldn't it?\n\nThis game may not be for everybody, but I strongly suggest anyone, especially ANYONE who's played Age of Empires, Starcraft, Warcraft; BUY THIS GAME. PLAY THIS GAME. It will refresh your dull old expectations for a strategy game of that nature. The price on Steam is not bad either, even without the discounts. I usually just go pirated but it's an insult not to support Firefly Studios for this classic, so I bought it! Just try it out. You won't be disappointed!!","December 6, 2013","true","17.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And it will probably stay like that for next few years. Visually it has barely aged. Graphics are vibrant, the castle feels alive, economy is solid, warfare is great, voice acting is pretty amazing and the best thing about this game. Soundtrack. That amazing sound of middle ages. It's believable, it's catchy, it's spectacular.

Even after like, what, 12 years from this game's release the graphics, gameplay and experience are still awesome for me. After a few years of not playing it, nostalgia kicks back in and thank goodness Steam has it when I decided to install Steam as one of my game hubs to base my games on. Even though it's has no flashy graphics like Starcraft: Wings of Liberty or Call of Duty, the graphics have most certainly endured. Even I don't know why. Maybe it's because the experience made up for it, or maybe the detail that goes to each building and terrain defies ravages of time. The gameplay, especially if you're into management and simulators like let's say Age of Empires and its similar counterparts like Warcraft, this will DEFINITELY be a breath of fresh air for you. I guarantee it!! After actually playing this game, I couldn't go back to Age of Empires II because as great as Age of Empires is, it simply became lackluster and it's like you had your fill of it and there's nothing new, you know? But Stronghold. It's amazing after a decade I still can replay a game and still feel like I've never played it. Maybe it's because the game as a whole actually FEELS REAL. You see little people, doing their merry little jobs, greeting you if you click on them, and every single one of the living creature has their own name. The logic in this game is absolutely fantastic; it gets you to think how content the people are, how fast the jobs' going to be done, how soon do you need to consider managing the food rations......It feels REAL.\n\nThe campaigns are great with a good pace of difficulty, and one of the most amazing trait of this game that amuses me and still makes me smile to this day is how every single character with a voice seems to be voiced by the same guy - and all of them still sounds so different!! Of course they could have added more kinds of dialogues or add even more stuff to make the game more difficult and more real now that I've played it for so long. But then it'll be too hard for the starters, wouldn't it?\n\nThis game may not be for everybody, but I strongly suggest anyone, especially ANYONE who's played Age of Empires, Starcraft, Warcraft; BUY THIS GAME. PLAY THIS GAME. It will refresh your dull old expectations for a strategy game of that nature. The price on Steam is not bad either, even without the discounts. I usually just go pirated but it's an insult not to support Firefly Studios for this classic, so I bought it! Just try it out. You won't be disappointed!!","December 6, 2013","true","17.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It happens in real time, but you can pause whenever you like. The main draw of this game is how easy it is to build castles. You can drag and drop walls, towers, gates, etc and easily design your own castle. You take the role of a medieval lord and command your peasants to make cheese, harvest stone, and fight for you. Watching the villagers work is fun by itself, but most of the fun involves murdering enemies as they attack your castle. You can build moats, pits of spikes, war machines, cauldrons of oil, etc. to give yourself an advantage over the enemy. It's a solid game and it aged well.

A must for any RTS/Castle-Sim player.","April 16","true","22.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The original was, at the time, playable and engrossing.  The only change here is that the screen resolution now goes up to HD spec.  The graphics themselves have not been updated or redrawn, which is a little misleading, and could have been developed for the re-release.  In an attempt to turn a retro game into a modern game the designers have missed the boat, and could easily have done an entire makeover, as is happening with many other "revived" titles.  This boils down to an attempt to make you buy the same game all over again.  Compared to modern games, even those small-budget indie releases that have pretty basic graphics, this is some way down the line, losing out to titles like Banished.\n\nIf you've acquired this as part of the Stronghold bumper pack, then I'd suggest Stronghold 2 worth avoiding.  While it appears to have improved graphics, theres a sense of insolence aimed at users by the programmers, and it quickly becomes a pointless bit of nonsense with little connection to the "castle age" of our history.  It's a case of them putting the sim into simper.","November 30, 2015","true","1.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It's easy to pick up and start, and it's amazingly deep and entertaining.  They storyline is super cheesy, but fun.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, which is a good thing.  The villains, while two dimensional and easy to hate, are also rewarding to fight.  Each one has their own personality and fighting style, and when you finally defeat them, it makes it all the sweeter.  The focus of this game isn't on the plot or the storyline, but the castle-building aspect.  As such, they give the villains just enough depth to make you want to kill them, and they give you just enough plot to make the ending desireable.  There's no plot twist or big surprise.  Just a long trek through the campaign with the reward of killing the big bad at the end.  And it's a sweet ending when you get there.\n\nThe game has several modes.  The military campaign is the "story" mode, but there is also a much less linear but still entertaining economic campaign.  There are also a slew of one-off siege and castle defense scenarios, where you are given a set number of troops and a castle to either defend or conquer.  Finally, there is a free-build mode with highly customizable settings.  There is even a tutorial mode which is essentially free-build with easy objectives to help introduce the basics, but the military campaign does a good job of introducing new game mechanics at an easy-to-learn pace without making the campaign missions themselves boring.  The wide variety of modes focusing on all the different aspects of the game really help give it some replayability.\n\nThe one downside to this game is the pacing.  There are frequently times where you could probably get up, leave your computer, and let the game run without you needing to supervise.  Waiting to hit 500 of a resource while your castle wall is literally filled to the brim with archers and crossbowmen basically means that you can endure any attack, you just have to wait until the economy finishes gathering the resource.  Essentially, once you hit a certain point, the game turns into a waiting game, as you know you've won the mission but the tedium of actually finishing the objective for the map hasn't been done yet.  This is a minor issue at best, and only relevant in the missions focusing heavily on economy, but it's common enough to bear mentioning.\n\nLater games change the system.  Crusader is probably the crown jewel of the Stronghold series, and Stronghold 2 is still fun.  But this is the game that started it all, and frankly, it's inspired.  Everything is original, and very little is done wrong.  It's rare for the first game in a series to do nearly everything correctly.  Don't expect a compelling plot or deep three dimensional characters.  This game comes with one purpose - to be fun to play, and to give you a thin reason to throw hordes of macemen at the enemy's castle just to see how far you get.\n\nBottom Line: Absolutely worth it","December 19, 2015","true","23.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The thought of playing a castle builder / siege laying / medieval RTS game made me excited, but probably a bit too much excited.\nWhile the game itself is fine, I felt like it kinda aged. Not too badly, but still not too well.\n\nThe main campaign is divided into 2 parts, one "combat" part and another "economical" part. I only played through a quarter of the combat based campaign, took me around 1 hour to get there but... it felt quite dulling. You're only granted archers for quite a long time while the enemy got pikemen, archers, ladder carriers and catapults. It doesn't means it's difficult to beat them, in fact it's quite easy since you're in a defensive position. And that's where it's dulling.\n\nI only managed to almost lose one time during this playthrough. The game isn't difficult and after a bit of tweaking you get a winning strategy quite quickly. While the game is kinda quick paced, you just have to pick up the pace and that's it. The lack of diversity in the units given out makes it even more boring for those first parts of the campaign since... well you only have one single strategy to apply.\n\nOut of boredom, I switched to a free play to discover in one go everything the game had to offer. While it's a good thing to keep stuff simple, the game oversimplifies things a lot. Building construction mainly requires wood and stone (for fortification mainly), you only have 4 type of food (and you can just focus on one since having diversity is cool but really unnecessary) and special other resources are mainly for army building (iron, leather and horses). Buildings are constructed instantly (and so are military units) which is great for impatient people but at the same time making it unrewarding. I basically built every single building and military units under 30 minutes in freeplay.\nThere’s a lot of other stuff that the game oversimplify that made me go meh but I’m gonna keep it “short” and stop there.\n\nThis lack of diversity (and ultimately of strategy) got me bored in less than 3 hours of gameplay. This game might have been great at its time, but, as of now, other games that were released in them mean time might’ve made me too demanding for this one.\n\n4/10","October 14, 2015","false","3.0"," 13 of 50 people (26%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","26","13","50","4","2"

So this review is just for Strongholds 2 only.\n\nMy thoughts?\n\nComplicated and tool tips where kind of hidden. I do not like how the tool tips are not realy all that helpfule. I still can't figure out how to fill my armory with weapons before the AI is ready to kill me. Speaking of AI it somehow found its way around my STONE WALL. I have no idea how that happen since the only way was throught it. AI is also kind of dumb. I tell my army to go attack another and what do they do just walk on by the enemy and to the spot I told them to attack them at. -_-' So to Quote Phoebe Kalinowski ...... "So yeah.... thats a thing now." Just forget that they will chase you and kill your men, they haft to get to that spot. Oh and the courthouse is completely *&^%ing usless. It is supost to stop crime so you get to torture poeple. Well thats a interesting concept if it work. Oh and for those who are new at RTS or never played strong holds but play others. Pesants are always AI controlled wich is like Blizzard coming in and saying You no long controll your drones we do. Here drone have a candy bar now go play in the corner. Mean while your setting there going where are my resoucres as the drone is spining in circles like a dog chassing its tial. This concept is stupid why would you do this? Oh and you can't go take over estates via military no you haft to buy them. With Honor... In real life or other games I would normaly just go over to site B and say mine. Anyone who disagree would be dead already since brut force has a much more enjoyible feeling I think. I think this why I choose to play Starcraft more then other RTS. Also I was realy tire when I wrote this so please forgive any spelling errores that I might have forgotten after editing this.","February 1, 2014","false","0.3"," 2 of 75 people (3%) found this review helpful","3","2","75","0","0"

I had never played any of the Stronghold games prior to starting this one a few weeks ago. I’m not usually a fan of RTS games so I didn’t have high hopes, although I did like the premise and had heard good things. I was pleasantly surprised by Stronghold HD.\n\nGenerally most missions fall under the category of “protect your castle long enough to make n of x.” There are gradual variations in this as the game progresses and gets more complex. The game will slowly reveal more and more of itself in a way that gives you time to learn the mechanics but can at times come across as a bit too slow.\n\nI have not yet beaten the game so I can’t speak for the entirety of the story. I am a little over halfway through and it appears the general story is that your are leading a group of patriotic rebels who are trying to restore legitimate rule in medieval England after the king was dethroned.\n\nMy two biggest complaints would be the tutorial and primitiveness.  Having never really played I game like this I first went to the tutorial where I learned all I thought I needed to know. However, the tutorial tells you nothing about combat which is perhaps half of the game. The military campaign makes up for this by going slow enough and being informative enough to function as a tutorial. Also, as previously mentioned, the game can feel somewhat repetitive at times with only slight variation in many of the missions.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed Stronghold HD. With only some minor faults I find this to be a very good game and definitely worth a look if you are interested in a medieval strategy game.","February 11, 2015","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've sunk many, many hours into it as I've had it before and only recently bought it on steam.\n\n\n\nLong, nostalgia infected, review:\n\nOne of the best castle management games I've ever played. I've beat it twice before, ages ago, and once again when I got it on steam.\n\nThe game holds up very well despite it's age. The maps come to life with wildlife like wolfs, rabbits, deer, bears and birds like eagles and seaguls. Trees move in the wind and water flows in the river. The sound effects are also really good and differs depending on what you focus your screen on. Scroll over the forrest an you'll hear the wind in the trees, over rivers you'll hear the water flow and over the ocean you'll hear the waves and the seagulls. If you scroll over buildings you'll hear the sound of work going on inside. Building walls and roofs also becomes transparent when work is going on, showing animations of workers/weapon makers (and in the case of inn's: drunkards) inside.\n\nAll of the inhabitants in your castle deliver some simple dialogue when selected, reflecting what they think of the imminent situation and about you as their lord. When attacked women and children scream as they run for their homes to take cover.\n\nAll of this makes the landscape and the castle come to life. Everything is littered with small details adding to the visual and audible appeal.\n\nAs for gameplay there's a main military campaign with 21 separate missions, as well as a shorter Economic Campaign. In the military campaing focus lies on training units and defeating your enemy or successfully defend against enemy attack, while the economic campaign focus on gathering specific supplies.\nThere are also stand alone missions like historically inspired sieges feauturing game renderings of real life castles.\n\nYou don't control your peasants but only your military units. Peasants moves to your castle if you have housing for them and provide them with food. You'll have to balance the amount of food you hand out and your tax rate to keep people happy. If they are unhappy they will leave your castle.\nYou can also manage your peasants by placing "good" or "bad" things. Placing ponds and gardens increase happiness and gives your soldiers bonuses in a fight, but your peasants will work slower strolling in the park now and then. Placing chopping blocks or skulls on spikes will do the opposite. It will lower happiness and give soldiers penalties in battles but increase output from your buildings.\n\nThe crafting tree is pretty complicated in Stronghold. To make bread you first need a wheat farm, then a wind mill and last a bakery. All goods go through the stockpile beside your Keep/Stronghold, except bread that goes to the granary. If either the granary or the stockpile gets full they will need to be expanded or production will halt. Have this in mind when placing buildings.\nWeapons follow the same rules: you need wood to make bows, crossbows and spears, iron to make platemale, swords and maces, and leather to make leather armour. To get wood you need woodchoppers, to get iron you need mines and to get leather you need a farm and a tanner.\nMany production lines cross, and you'll have to plan what to build based on the land available (apples and wheat don't grow in any soil, and cows need to grace) and the threat you are facing. You have to protect your lord or you will be immediatly defeated, but leave your farms unprotected and they will likely all be destroyed in the event of an attack.\n\nThere is also a freebuild mode where you build and manage your castle on a map of your choice without intervention. Build the castle of your dreams!\n\nA map editor is available where you can edit the terrain of your map and build castles and place buildings. Make your own scenario, stand alone mission or freebuild map.\nThe editor is also very fun to play around in. No buildings will function in this mode but you don't need resources as everything is placed for free. You can build castles, place units from different factions and have them fight eachother.\n\nOne negative aspect of the game is that the isometric view sometimes makes it hard to tell the elevation of different points on the map, and it's possible for characters to get stuck on terrain. Another problem is the path tracing. The enemy will always, immediatly find a hole in your wall but if your wall is intact they seem to attack the part closest to them. They do this even if that part is made up of 5 layers of stone wall and another section is made of fragile wooden wall.\nThis makes it quite easy to lure the enemie through deathtraps like making them run back an forth through a maze of stone walls with archers on them. You don't have to exploit it ofcourse but it can be hard to resist :p\n\nIn conclusion, it's a solid game and I've had a hard time finding anything with the same feel as Stronghold. The HD edition makes much more playable on modern screens as you can zoom out and see almost the entire map at once. I defenitly recommend this to anyone interested in strategy games. It will run on practically any computer and offer hours of fun, and I haven't even tried the multiplayer.","January 13, 2015","true","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For those unfarmiliar, Stronghold is a sort of economy based midevail RTS. Esentially, you are given a set of different scenarios in which you have to use the resources in the varying enviorments you are given. Sometimes, these enviornments will help you get an advantage to your enemy - you may be located close to trees, which will allow you to get a quick start on building many essential things, such as food and weapon producing buildings. Otherwise, you may be given a disadvantage at times and being able to make do with what you have can make victory all the more satisfying.\n\nIn Stronghold, you need to think carefully about how you spend your resources. On one hand, it will be important to build a barracks so you can hold a strong and ready militia to defend against your enemy's forces. On the other hand, in order to raise a decent army, you need to keep your peasants happy and in your castle. This requires keeping your grainary stocked with food, being able to have enough industrial buildings to build farms to keep peasants fed, and other mechanics.\n\nTo be victorious, you have to carefully plan out your divison of resources - it is equally important to keep your peasants populous and happy and to have a strong defence to wane off enemy attacks, as one good strike can land a once prosperous land in ruins, and you very vulnerable to further attacks. All in all, I would strongly recommend Stronghold to anybody new to the RTS genre. RTS veterans would probably enjoy playing this one, too. There's nothing quite as satisfying as surviving a seige and being able to crush your enemy in a few swift blows.","October 6, 2014","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The objective is to gather resources to feed the people and create blacksmiths,fletchers and armourys to create knights,archers etc. Although being around 10 years old, the game is excellent and can provide many hours of enjoyment and tactics. 90%","July 29, 2013","true","17.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(PS: If you have already played this game in its original version and liked it, SKIP THIS REVIEW AND BUY IT, NOW!)\n\n\nGameplay:  The gameplay is pretty fluid and simple: you basically have to manage every aspect of your castle, since the food/raw materials production and popularity levels to weapon production and training soldiers - One of the most complete experiences in medieval RTS.\nGraphics:  This game is from 2001, so don't expect top noch graphics. Nevertheless I like them pretty much, it's an unique kind of 2D/3D design that can be a little confusing sometimes, but is really pretty.\nMusic: Beautiful, really beutiful. One of the best themes I've ever listened to. It's so calm and...It's awesome.\nVoice Acting:  It's so good that "I CAN'T PLACE THAT THERE MILORD" xD\nCampaing: Has a simple, but still very involving storyline. Your enemies (The Rat, The Snake, The Pig and The Wolf) are very iconic and funny characters.\nPSS: The "HD" version doesn't change a thing in this game, just upgrades the overall resolution and compatibility\n\n\nFinal score: Over 9000/10, aka BUY IT!","September 13, 2014","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd already developed a taste for strategy games playing Age of Empires and its sequel Age of Empires II: Age of Kings, so I was more than willing to give this one a try as well. And I have never regretted it. 13 years later I still play Stronghold on a regular basis. I lost my CD-ROM copy years ago, and when I saw that Stronghold was available on Steam I bought it instantly - I doubt I even looked at the price. Stronghold's two campaigns are both compelling and challenging, and its various stand-alone missions are equally enjoyable. The map editor in this first installment is, in my opinion, easier to work and more accessible than the map editors of later games (indeed, I don't think any subsequent game has quite matched the overall quality of the original title, much as I enjoy Stronghold Crusader and Stronghold 2 .... the less said of Stronghold Legends and Stronghold 3 the better). I would highly recommend Stronghold to any fan of RTS or Simulator games and know that I shall be playing it for years to come.","September 14, 2014","true","33.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There were no real city/castle functions that to me were essential. Such as feasting in the hall, Jousting, Lady's chamber, and so on. There wasn't any at all. No crime and punishment system, just decorations like gallows and heads on poles and such that only is cosmetic in the game itself and not an essential function like in SH2 you would build a courthouse/dungeon-then guard posts-criminals commit crimes-guards arrest them and bring to courthouse-sentence carried out, sent to torturer's to be tortured. Now in the first few games of the series I know that the crime and punishment was not a system and purely cosmetic  but my problem was SH1-didn't have it SH2-got it and SH3 gold-dropped it again! That was not the only problem though.Then we got the SH legends and Crusader- with out it Firefly is still not done dumbing down the greatest part of the game. Believe me SH2 is the highlight of the entire series as far as I am concerned that was good and very fun to mod. But it's like a pizza place in town, if the pizza isn't that great it doesn't matter because its the only pizza place in town. That sums up the Stronghold series in general which when it has it's moments I really love and adored but the ugly truth is developer is failing miserably and does not have the first clue about what went right in their early years of sucess and the recent releases impending doom as they keep making promises they don't live up to. Then leave it unfinished but release it anyways. They insult my intelligence by removing the crime and punishment system, gong system, rat system for better graphics. They severely screwed up the map editor in SH3 which to me is unusable and painfully stupid, as is and I was a freakin' pro at editing maps in SH2! So buyer beware! If hardcore fans of the game (and I am one of them) lose respect for a series and developer like I have then trust me. SH2 and earlier are the jewels of the series. SH3-FAIL SHLegends-FAIL SH3GOLD-EPIC FAIL! SHCrusader II-FAIL same broken logic as SH3Gold. Then there are the glitches, bugs, lags, poor AI, cardboard like wall strength that I was like okay well in SH2 it was a bit more acceptable but by SH3Gold rolled around they should have had their stuff together, but no. Sadly they did not. I await the release that is SH2 with more added to it and nothing taken away plus the good 3d graphics and day night cycle. Did I mention in SH3 Gold your castle's residents get upset when it rains? At you, really at you; that is as if every medieval Lord ran the weather too (der dee der) I guess since there is no more gong to cleanup because in SH3 Gold they don't go to the bathroom, they had to gve them something to be upset about! I only recommend buying SH2.","October 1, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(PS: If you have already played this game in its original version and liked it, SKIP THIS REVIEW AND BUY IT, NOW!)\n\n\nGameplay:  The gameplay is pretty fluid and simple: you basically have to manage every aspect of your castle, since the food/raw materials production and popularity levels to weapon production and training soldiers - One of the most complete experiences in medieval RTS.\nGraphics:  This game is from 2001, so don't expect top noch graphics. Nevertheless I like them pretty much, it's an unique kind of 2D/3D design that can be a little confusing sometimes, but is really pretty.\nMusic: Beautiful, really beutiful. One of the best themes I've ever listened to. It's so calm and...It's awesome.\nVoice Acting:  It's so good that "I CAN'T PLACE THAT THERE MILORD" xD\nCampaing: Has a simple, but still very involving storyline. Your enemies (The Rat, The Snake, The Pig and The Wolf) are very iconic and funny characters.\nPSS: The "HD" version doesn't change a thing in this game, just upgrades the overall resolution and compatibility\n\n\nFinal score: Over 9000/10, aka BUY IT!","September 13, 2014","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd already developed a taste for strategy games playing Age of Empires and its sequel Age of Empires II: Age of Kings, so I was more than willing to give this one a try as well. And I have never regretted it. 13 years later I still play Stronghold on a regular basis. I lost my CD-ROM copy years ago, and when I saw that Stronghold was available on Steam I bought it instantly - I doubt I even looked at the price. Stronghold's two campaigns are both compelling and challenging, and its various stand-alone missions are equally enjoyable. The map editor in this first installment is, in my opinion, easier to work and more accessible than the map editors of later games (indeed, I don't think any subsequent game has quite matched the overall quality of the original title, much as I enjoy Stronghold Crusader and Stronghold 2 .... the less said of Stronghold Legends and Stronghold 3 the better).

I'm glad to see this in an HD remake for modern systems.  I just really enjoy this game a lot and it i definitely one that I keep coming back to several years after its initial publish.\n\nThe game plays a lot like any other "simulation" game in that you don't have direct control over the minions you have available.  Rather, you make buildings that provide jobs for your minions.  This creates chains of industry.  For example, you spot a woodworker's hut to gather wood.  Then spot a Fletcher's workshop to create bows.  Supplement this with a cow farm/tanner's facility to provide leather armor and now your fletcher can begin making crossbows (or it could be iron...haven't played in a while!).\n\nStrategy comes in laying out your castle defenses or siege equipment, depending on the mission.  Sighting walls, towers, and gates can provide almost god-like advantages in holding off massive sieges.  On the other side, deciding where to send your tunnelers and siege equipment while covering them with archers can open holes in the most vulnerable of positions.\n\nIf you're looking for the latest graphics, or expecting something visually spectacular, pass up this game for something else.  Stronghold HD is just a resolution update for a game that came out in 2001.  Also, the AI can be downright predictable as it tends to want to assemble in the same place and wait for a while before beginning its siege phase.  This makes some missions laughably easy as you're able to set up traps in this assembly area and slaughter the AI army long before they begin to make their first moves.\n\nAltogether, though, it's a fun game.  Definitely a must-play if you're a thinking type person who likes a bare minimum of city planning.","January 1, 2014","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That is, folks for whom this game pulls no nostalgic heartstrings but might still be interested in playing it.\n\nA Review:\n\nAfter the last season of Game of Thrones ended, I began looking for a game that would satisfy my Medieval itch, but wouldn't be as complicated as something like Crusader Kings. Stronghold HD is the game I settled on checking out and I couldn't be more satisfied with it (though there is a severe lack of assassins for my taste, maybe I'll check out Stronghold Crusader).\n\nThe basic premise of most of the game's levels is classic Rampart from the NES days: either build from scratch or take over a castle, then defend it from waves of invaders with breaks in between to rebuild and refortify your defenses and replenish your troops until you clear the level. There are plenty of variations to this premise as the game's campaign goes on, and you're ever so slowly advanced up the tech tree, but that's generally the gist for most of the game as far as I can tell (I'm not quite finished with the main campaign yet, but I'm doubting a big turnaround at this point).\n\nThere's a lot of Age of Empires 2 in not only the controls, but the game's graphical and audio stylings, but that really isn't a bad thing, as well designed pre-rendered 3D as seen here turns out to be quite timeless, and even the most amateurish British voice over sounds pretty classy.\n\nSo yeah, it's a High Medieval RTS/City Builder/Castle Builder with a lot of elements of what would eventually be tower defense in it for good measure . . . that's the game, and there really isn't more to it than that. Fairly uncomplicated really, and that's a good thing, as it leads to a very polished and enjoyable experience for when you're in the mood to put on your Lordly crown, and order some peasants to toil in the fields or add more mortar to the walls.\n\nOh and since it is a classic retro game, there's a LOT of content. I mean, the multiple campaigns (There's an economic mode I haven't even tried yet) have a ton of levels (replete with a silly little story and characters) and that's on top of a map editor and an MP mode! Seriously, on content alone you're going to get your money's worth.\n\nStill, if you're more into leading an army rather than manning the walls, this isn't going to be the game for you. For that, I'll say to check out Medieval Total War (1 or 2, both are good). And if you want to focus more on the city building, Banished will probably be more to your tastes. And if you want a mix of both but a still more offensive based game, there's always Age of Empires.\n\nBut if you're like me, and just want a game that:\n\nA) Stays in the Middle Ages rather than hopping around time\nB) Let's you boss a bunch of peasants around while you sit at your computer drinking red wine from your goblet, and\nC) Lets you focus on designing your dream castle in intricate detail\n\n. . . then this is the game for you milord!","July 14, 2014","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've sunk many, many hours into it as I've had it before and only recently bought it on steam.\n\n\n\nLong, nostalgia infected, review:\n\nOne of the best castle management games I've ever played. I've beat it twice before, ages ago, and once again when I got it on steam.\n\nThe game holds up very well despite it's age. The maps come to life with wildlife like wolfs, rabbits, deer, bears and birds like eagles and seaguls. Trees move in the wind and water flows in the river. The sound effects are also really good and differs depending on what you focus your screen on. Scroll over the forrest an you'll hear the wind in the trees, over rivers you'll hear the water flow and over the ocean you'll hear the waves and the seagulls. If you scroll over buildings you'll hear the sound of work going on inside. Building walls and roofs also becomes transparent when work is going on, showing animations of workers/weapon makers (and in the case of inn's: drunkards) inside.\n\nAll of the inhabitants in your castle deliver some simple dialogue when selected, reflecting what they think of the imminent situation and about you as their lord. When attacked women and children scream as they run for their homes to take cover.\n\nAll of this makes the landscape and the castle come to life. Everything is littered with small details adding to the visual and audible appeal.\n\nAs for gameplay there's a main military campaign with 21 separate missions, as well as a shorter Economic Campaign. In the military campaing focus lies on training units and defeating your enemy or successfully defend against enemy attack, while the economic campaign focus on gathering specific supplies.\nThere are also stand alone missions like historically inspired sieges feauturing game renderings of real life castles.\n\nYou don't control your peasants but only your military units. Peasants moves to your castle if you have housing for them and provide them with food. You'll have to balance the amount of food you hand out and your tax rate to keep people happy. If they are unhappy they will leave your castle.\nYou can also manage your peasants by placing "good" or "bad" things. Placing ponds and gardens increase happiness and gives your soldiers bonuses in a fight, but your peasants will work slower strolling in the park now and then. Placing chopping blocks or skulls on spikes will do the opposite. It will lower happiness and give soldiers penalties in battles but increase output from your buildings.\n\nThe crafting tree is pretty complicated in Stronghold. To make bread you first need a wheat farm, then a wind mill and last a bakery. All goods go through the stockpile beside your Keep/Stronghold, except bread that goes to the granary. If either the granary or the stockpile gets full they will need to be expanded or production will halt. Have this in mind when placing buildings.\nWeapons follow the same rules: you need wood to make bows, crossbows and spears, iron to make platemale, swords and maces, and leather to make leather armour. To get wood you need woodchoppers, to get iron you need mines and to get leather you need a farm and a tanner.\nMany production lines cross, and you'll have to plan what to build based on the land available (apples and wheat don't grow in any soil, and cows need to grace) and the threat you are facing. You have to protect your lord or you will be immediatly defeated, but leave your farms unprotected and they will likely all be destroyed in the event of an attack.\n\nThere is also a freebuild mode where you build and manage your castle on a map of your choice without intervention. Build the castle of your dreams!\n\nA map editor is available where you can edit the terrain of your map and build castles and place buildings. Make your own scenario, stand alone mission or freebuild map.\nThe editor is also very fun to play around in. No buildings will function in this mode but you don't need resources as everything is placed for free. You can build castles, place units from different factions and have them fight eachother.\n\nOne negative aspect of the game is that the isometric view sometimes makes it hard to tell the elevation of different points on the map, and it's possible for characters to get stuck on terrain. Another problem is the path tracing. The enemy will always, immediatly find a hole in your wall but if your wall is intact they seem to attack the part closest to them. They do this even if that part is made up of 5 layers of stone wall and another section is made of fragile wooden wall.\nThis makes it quite easy to lure the enemie through deathtraps like making them run back an forth through a maze of stone walls with archers on them. You don't have to exploit it ofcourse but it can be hard to resist :p\n\nIn conclusion, it's a solid game and I've had a hard time finding anything with the same feel as Stronghold. The HD edition makes much more playable on modern screens as you can zoom out and see almost the entire map at once. I defenitly recommend this to anyone interested in strategy games. It will run on practically any computer and offer hours of fun, and I haven't even tried the multiplayer.","January 13, 2015","true","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You then place a Granary. The rest is up to you. Build homes to increase your population cap. Build woodcutters to harvest wood from (renewable) forest. Build farms, mills, bakeries, make beer, build taverns. Build chapels, churches, cathedrals. Place gardens, statues, and other good things to increase happiness. Build gibbet, stretching rack, stocks, and other horrible things to increase work efficiency.\n\nTax! Good things increase happiness, so does full and extra food rations; bad things lower the effect of good things and decrease happiness - but are vital. With a market you can sell excess supplies, and buy needed ones; including weapons. You may also build worksites to craft weapons, armor, etc that fill your armory; even stables can be built for mounted knights. That's right, you create an army.\n\nTo build weapons you must harvest resources such as wood, stone, iron, even pitch for fire-pits; and wood for spike-pits. Stone allows you to build castle walls. With wood alone you may build basic fortifications that don't hold up well to assault. You can build moats, or towers and place siege engines atop them. If you're invading, you can build siege equipment and even tunnelers to take out fortifications or take over castle walls with your own troops.\n\nCheck the number of hours I've played... and ignore the bad reviews.","December 2, 2014","true","534.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

True to its word this is a castle sim and not really a RTS or at least not a traditional one.\n\nFor one thing you see everything on the map right when you start so you don't explore it at all. The size of the map is fairly small too usually.\n\nThe focus is on just you actually. If you're defending you want to muster up as many troops as you can to repel enemy invasions or if you're attacking it's about using your army well so you don't take needless losses.\n\nAnd making an army from scratch isn't easy either. You not only need a free peasant but also any weapons or armor that the particular unit needs. For more basic units this is just the weapon but you'll also need to make the armor for more powerful units.\n\nGetting resources isn't a quick process. A hunter has to shoot a deer, bring it back to his area, cut it up and bring that to your castle's granary. If you want to make your peasants eat bread, you need to make the wheat, turn that into flour and turn that into bread, so that's 3 different peasants you'll need right there.\n\nYour peasants need to be fed of course, Otherwise they become very unhappy and will likely leave your castle before long so making them happy is a good idea. It's pretty easy to manipulate it though with how much food you give them and how much tax you want out of them. But as your population rises so too does the rate at which your food depletes.\n\nWhat's interesting is that you can make buildings instantly, including the walls so you don't have to spend time worrying too much about that aside from some buildings that need to be placed on certain places.\n\nThe military campaign is where the main story is. There's a economic campagin but it's not nearly as long or interesting. The voice acting in it is cheesy in a good way. It can be pretty difficult though.\n\nThe game looks about the same as I remember it but being able to play in 1920x1080 is nice.\n\nAt the price it's asking for I'd say it's worth it. I play it on a Windows 7 machine and I don't have any issue running the game.\n","March 16","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I will reccomend this to everyone. If you want an even better game though, buy Stronghold Crusader, it is a masterpiece.\n\nWARNING: Dont buy Stronghold 3 or Stronghold Crusader 2.

I have loved it ever since I first tried it. The campaign has, I think, an interesting storyline, but one of the main things I like about it is that it doesn't have to be about combat (although it often is). The economic campaign provides several missions that, to the best of my memory (I haven't recompleted it yet) involve no fighting. It is, however, the military campaign that is my favourite bit of the game. I found it very fun and not at all repetetive (unless you happen to fail a mission, which I always find a bit disheartening and it often leaves me going away and sulking for a while!) - each mission brings something new, be it a new threat, building or soldier.\n\nMy one complaint about this game is the lack of the skirmish mode that Crusader or Legends included, but even without it this is still one of my favourite games of all time. I would heartily recommend buying it.","February 24, 2015","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Plays great on my Alienware Alpha (i7) with Windows 10, full screen on my 47" 1080p TV, no issues or crashes.  It actually runs at 1080p pretty well, but the tree leaves look a little funny, like a flicker, but aren't a glitch, just the animation of the leaves blowing.  I actually find the text and icons too small at 1080 on my 47" TV, so I set it to a lower wide-screen resolution that is easier on my eyes and works well.  I think the game is well paced and incrementally teaches you the mechanics.  It is a classic resource management, defense, and offense, at a slower pace than modern RTS.  You can play it a little more casually, but still have a challenge.  It plays better than I thought it would be for its age.  7/10 for me, no issues.","January 31","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

True to its word this is a castle sim and not really a RTS or at least not a traditional one.\n\nFor one thing you see everything on the map right when you start so you don't explore it at all. The size of the map is fairly small too usually.\n\nThe focus is on just you actually. If you're defending you want to muster up as many troops as you can to repel enemy invasions or if you're attacking it's about using your army well so you don't take needless losses.\n\nAnd making an army from scratch isn't easy either. You not only need a free peasant but also any weapons or armor that the particular unit needs. For more basic units this is just the weapon but you'll also need to make the armor for more powerful units.\n\nGetting resources isn't a quick process. A hunter has to shoot a deer, bring it back to his area, cut it up and bring that to your castle's granary. If you want to make your peasants eat bread, you need to make the wheat, turn that into flour and turn that into bread, so that's 3 different peasants you'll need right there.\n\nYour peasants need to be fed of course, Otherwise they become very unhappy and will likely leave your castle before long so making them happy is a good idea. It's pretty easy to manipulate it though with how much food you give them and how much tax you want out of them. But as your population rises so too does the rate at which your food depletes.\n\nWhat's interesting is that you can make buildings instantly, including the walls so you don't have to spend time worrying too much about that aside from some buildings that need to be placed on certain places.\n\nThe military campaign is where the main story is. There's a economic campagin but it's not nearly as long or interesting. The voice acting in it is cheesy in a good way. It can be pretty difficult though.\n\nThe game looks about the same as I remember it but being able to play in 1920x1080 is nice.\n\nAt the price it's asking for I'd say it's worth it. I play it on a Windows 7 machine and I don't have any issue running the game.\n","March 16","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a really good game if you like strategy games. Sure, the game is old, but it is fun and interesting. You can find yourself overwhelmed at first by so many things to do, and all the available resources, but once you get used to this (the game gives you a lot of tips), you will enjoy it.\n\nThe game itself consists on a Military Campaign, which contains a storyline and 21 missions. You can also replay historical or fan made castles, like Camelot. You can also play Economic Missions, were you have to get "x" resource/s, or do other stuff in a limited amount of time. Apart from this, you can edit your own scenarios and play them. You can also play Sieges (attack or defend the castle), Invasions (hold against the enemy) Free Build or Multiplayer games.\n\nThere are four difficulties: Easy, Normal, Hard and Very Hard. The game is, I believe, fairly balanced. Your troops vary from crossbowmen and archers to pikermen, macemen, knights, catapults, laddermen, rams and other units. There are random events that benefit or harm you, like a fair or wolves attacking your villagers.\n\nSo, I'd recommend this game to any fan of Strategy games. The only critic I would make is that the HD could be better (in my opinion). Other than that, it's a solid game.\n","January 22","true","21.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played this game a lot long before it ever arrived on Steam. Together with stronghold: crusader, both of these games are among my favourite strategy games, despite their age. There was one thing I wanted to add that was missing from the reviews so far. A problem with the game in general and especially later in the campaign track is that the game misses the sweet spot of a challenging difficulty. What exactly do I mean by this? Simply put, missions are either to easy or quite near impossible to complete. For some this might not be an issue, but a lot of the time you are either playing a magnificent castle building simulator (the opposing players are mere ants assaulting your amazing fortress) or you are being mercilessly bludgeoned to dead by an overpowered team of enemies. If the fun of the first and the challenge of the latter sound great to you, I would recommend the game wholeheartedly.","January 30","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Thankfully, that cheating habit was gone when I started playing in multiplayer games.\n\nYou know... I'm not really sure what I should say about Stronghold. Maybe that it is praised to be the best medieval strategy? I guess it is.\n\nSo uhh... Yeah, get it.

More Monty Python than Game of Thrones of course.\n\nThis is a genuinely different take on the RTS genre. It's sort of a supply chain simulator + tower defense game + rts game.\n\nYou will mostly be making sure your inputs and outputs are efficient in your base area, and building defenses so that the enemy raids don't crush you.\n\nThe actual attacking part of the game plays a lot like any RTS from this era, and it's almost always the least interesting part of your time with this game.\n\nAlso keep in mind that none of this is abstracted. You will actually see the peasant walk from the dairy farm to the place where the food is dumped. If you put the food place (granary) to far away it could have an impact on your army economically. Maximizing your supply chain is *required* for victory on the normal difficulty in this game.\n\nYet\n\nThis focus on economy and tower defense means that this game is SLOOOOOOOOOW paced. You will spend the first 20 (real time ) minutes getting your supply chain worked out.\n\nThe A.I may then throw some weapon at you that you were not prepared for and your walls will be punctured and it's basically game over as they wreck your carefully tinkered economy.\n\nYou need a lot of time to beat this game on even a normal difficulty.\n\nGreat value game and also a gameplay idea that you don't normally see. The closest approximation would be the iphone typeof base builder games. But this is much more complex and isn't built with any of the fee-2-play mechanics. Also this game came out waaaaaaaaay before smartphones.","June 3","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
